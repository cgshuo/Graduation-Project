Using Holder Sum Inequality, we have the following inequality hold further expanded as: According to the induction assumption, the extension of Holder Sum Inequality holds for any k  X  l . Therefore, we can use it to upper bound the second item in the RHS of above equation, i.e. By merging inequality (A3) and (A2) together, we have extension of Holder Sum Inequality proved when k = l +1.
