 The Moneyball revolution coincided with a shift in the way professional sporting organizations handle and utilize data in terms of decision making processes. Due to the demand for better sports analytics and the improvement in sensor tech-nology, there has been a plethora of ball and player tracking information generated within professional sports for analyt-ical purposes. However, due to the continuous nature of the data and the lack of associated high-level labels to describe it -this rich set of information has had very limited use espe-cially in the analysis of a team X  X  tactics and strategy. In this paper, we give an overview of the types of analysis currently performed mostly with hand-labeled event data and high-light the problems associated with the influx of spatiotem-poral data. By way of example, we present an approach which uses an entire season of ball tracking data from the English Premier League (2010-2011 season) to reinforce the common held belief that teams should aim to  X  X in home games and draw away ones X . We do this by: i) forming a representation of team behavior by chunking the incoming spatiotemporal signal into a series of quantized bins, and ii) generate an expectation model of team behavior based on a code-book of past performances. We show that home ad-vantage in soccer is partly due to the conservative strategy of the away team. We also show that our approach can flag anomalous team behavior which has many potential appli-cations.

(b) Spatiotemporal data has the po-tential to describe the where and how , but as it is a continuous signal which is not associated with a fixed event, using this data for analysis is difficult.
In his 2003 book Moneyball [14], Michael Lewis docu-mented how Oakland A X  X  General Manager Billy Beane was able to effectively use metrics derived from hand-crafted statistics to exploit the inefficiencies in the value of indi-vidual baseball players. Around the same time, Basketball on Paper [24] was published which outlined methods for valuing player performance in basketball which is a far more challenging problem because it is a continuous team sport. Due to the popularity and effectiveness of the tools that em-anated from these works, there has been enormous interest in the field of sports analytics over the last 10 years with many organizations (e.g. professional teams, media groups) housing their own analytics department. However, nearly all of the analytical works have dealt solely with hand-labeled event data which describes what happened (e.g. basketball -rebounds, points scored, assists, football -yards per carry, tackles, sacks, soccer -passes, shots, tackles (see Figure 1(a))). Once the data is in this form, most approaches just relate to parsing in the relevant data from a database, then ap-plying sport-based rules and standard statistical methods, including regression and optimization.

As most sporting environments tend to be dynamic with multiple players continuously moving and competing against each other, simple event statistics do not capture the com-plex aspects of the game. To gain an advantage over the rest of the field, sporting organizations have recently looked to employ commercial tracking technologies which can lo-cate the position of the ball and players at each time instant in professional leagues [29, 32, 9, 26] 1 -to determine where and how events happen. Even though there is potentially an enormous amount of hidden team behavioral information to mine from such sources, due to the sheer volume as well as the noisy and variable length of the data, methods which can adequately represent team behaviors are yet to be devel-oped. The value of this data is limited as little analysis can be conducted. What compounds the difficulty of this task is the low-scoring and/or continuous nature of many team sports (e.g. soccer, hockey, basketball) which makes it very hard to associate segments of play with high-level behaviors (e.g. tactics, strategy, style, system, formations). Without these labels, which essentially give the game context, infer-ring team strategy or behavior is impossible as there are no factors to condition against (see Figure 1(b)).

Due to these complexities, there has been no effective method of utilizing spatiotemporal data in continuous sports. Having suitable methods which can first develop suitable representations from imperfect (e.g. noisy or impartial) data, and then learn team behaviors in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner, as well as recognize and predict future behaviors would greatly enhance decision making in all ar-eas of the sporting landscape (e.g. coaching, broadcasting, fantasy-games, video games, betting etc.). We call this the emerging field of Sports Spatiotemporal Analytics -and we show an example of this new area of analytics by compar-ing the strategies of home and away teams in the English Premier League by using ball tracking data.
The use of automatic sports analysis systems have re-cently graduated from the virtual to the real-world. This is due in part to the popularity of live-sport, the amount of live-sport being broadcasted, the proliferation of mobile devices, the rise of second-screen viewing, the amount of data/statistics being generated for sports, and demand for in-depth reporting and analysis of sport. Systems which use match statistics to automatically generate narratives have already been deployed [33, 2]. Although impressive, these solutions just give a low-level description of match statistics and notable individual performances without giving any tac-tical analysis about factors which contributed to the result. In tennis, IBM has created Slamtracker [10] which can pro-vide player analysis by finding patterns that characterize the best chance a player has to beat another player from an enormous amount of event labeled data -although no spa-tiotemporal data (i.e. player or ball tracking information) has been used in their analysis yet.

Spatiotemporal data has been used extensively in the vi-sualization of sports action. Examples include vision-based systems which track baseball pitches for Major League Base-ball [31], and ball and players in basketball and soccer [32, 29]. Hawk-Eye deploy vision-based systems which track the ball in tennis and cricket, and is often used to aid in the officiating of these matches in addition to providing visu-
As nearly all professional leagues currently forbid the use of wearable sensors on players, unobtrusive data capture meth-ods such as vision-based systems or armies of human annota-tors are used to provide player and ball tracking information. However, this restriction may change soon as monitoring the health and well-being of players has attracted significant in-terest lately, especially for concussions in American Foot-ball [19], as well as heart issues in soccer [3]. alizations for the television broadcasters [9]. Partial data sources normally generated by human annotators such as shot-charts in basketball and ice-hockey are often used for analysis [23], as well as passing and shot charts in soccer [26]. Recently, ESPN developed a new quarterback rating in American Football called  X  X otalQBR X  [25] which attempts to assign credit or blame to the quarterback depending on a host of factors such as pass or catch quality, importance in the match, pass thrown under pressure or not. As these factors are quite subjective, annotators who are reliable in labeling such variables are used. In terms of strategic anal-ysis, zonalmarking.net [37] attempts to describe a soccer match from a tactical and formation point of view. Whilst interesting, this approach is still qualitative and is based solely on the opinion of the analyst.

As the problem of fully automatic multi-agent tracking from vision-based systems is still an open one, most aca-demic research has centered on the tracking problem [1, 27, 17, 5]. The lack of fully automated tracking approaches has limited team behavioral research to works on limited size datasets. The first work which looked at using spatiotem-poral data for team behavior analysis was conducted over 10 years ago by Intille and Bobick [12]. In this seminal work, the authors used a probabilistic model to recognize a single football play from hand annotated player trajectories. Since then, multiple approaches have centered on recognizing foot-ball plays [16, 30, 15, 34], but only on a very small number of plays (i.e. 50-100). For soccer, Kim et al. [13] used the global motion of all players in a soccer match to predict where the play will evolve in the short-term. Beetz et al. [4] proposed a system which aims to track player and ball positions via a vision system for the use of automatic analysis of soccer matches. In basketball, Perse et al. [28] used trajectories of player movement to recognize three type of team offensive patterns. Morariu and Davis [21] integrated interval-based temporal reasoning with probabilistic logical inference to recognize events in one-on-one basketball. Hervieu et al. [11] also used player trajectories to recognize low-level team ac-tivities using a hierarchical parallel semi-Markov model. In addition to these works, plenty of work has centered on an-alyzing broadcast footage of sports for action, activity and highlight detection [36, 8] 2 . Even though notable, the lack of tracking data to adequately train models has limited the usefulness of the above research.

It is clear from the overview given above, that there ex-ists a major disparity in resources between industry and academia to deal with this problem domain. Sporting orga-nizations that receive large volumes of spatiotemporal data from third-party vendors but often the people within these organizations lack the computational skills or resources to make use of it. Contrastingly, due to the proprietary nature of commercial tracking systems, and the cost and method of generating the tracking data, research groups who have the necessary skills can not access these large data repositories. Recently however, due to the potential payoff, some industry groups are investing in analytical people with these skill sets, or have teamed up with research groups to help facilitate a solution. The release of STATS Sports VU data [32] to some research groups has enabled interesting analysis of shots and rebounding in the NBA[7, 20]. In tennis, Wei et al. [35]
These works only capture a portion of the field, making group analysis very difficult as all active players are rarely present in the all frames. SA = shots against). used ball and player tracking information to predict shots using data from the 2012 Australian Open. For soccer, re-searchers have characterized team behaviors in the English Premier League using ball-motion information across an en-tire season using OPTA data [18]. In this paper, we extend this method to explain that the home advantage in soccer is due to the conservative strategy that away teams use (or more aggressive approach of the home team) which rein-forces the commonly held belief that teams aim to win their home games and draw their away ones .
In a recent book by Moskowitz and Wertheim [22], they highlight that the home advantage exists in all professional sports (i.e. teams win more at home than away). The au-thors hypothesized that referees play a significant role by giving home teams favorable calls at critical moments. They then quantitatively showed this in baseball through the use of pitch tracking data. For soccer, hand-labeled event statis-tics such as the amount of injury time, number of yellow cards and number of penalties awarded to reinforce their hypothesis. As soccer is a very tactical game, we hypothe-size that the strategy of the home and away teams also plays a role in explaining the home advantage.
 A great case study of home advantage is the 2010-2011 English Premier League soccer season. In that season, the home team earned an average 1.71 points out of a total 3 points per match. This is in stark contrast with the away team, which earned only 1.00 points per game: a rather large discrepancy, especially considering that teams play ev-ery other team both at home and away so that any talent disparities apply to both home and away averages. In terms of shooting and passing proficiency, there was no signifi-cant difference between teams at home and away (10.01% vs 9.05% for shooting and 73.46% vs 72.99% for passing -see the bottom row in Table 1).

However, there is a large difference between the amount of shots (16.2 vs 13.0) and goals scored (1.62 vs 1.17) at home and away. An illuminating example is the league champions for that season, Manchester United (see top row in Table 1). At home, they were unbeaten (winning 18 and drawing 1), but away from home they only won 5 games, drew 10 and lost 4. The telling statistic is that at home they scored 49 goals from 347 shots, compared to only 29 goals from 272 shots away from home. Comparatively, the opposition at home games only scored a paltry 12 goals from 191 shots while at away games they scored 25 goals from 271 shots. In soccer, there is the commonly held belief that team should aim to win their home games and draw their away ones . If you skim down Table 1, you will find that: i) all teams won more home games (except for Blackpool who won the same amount), ii) all teams score more goals at home (except Ar-senal and Blackburn), iii) all teams had more shots at home compared to away, and iv) all teams gained more points at home. These event statistics tell us what has occurred, in the rest of the paper we use spatiotemporal data to help explain where and why this occurred. Before we detail the method, we first describe the data.
Due to the difficulty associated with accurately tracking players and the ball, data containing this information is still scarce. Most of the data collected is via an army of human annotators who label all actions that occur around the ball -which they call ball actions . The F24 soccer data feed col-lected for the English Premier League (EPL) by Opta [26] is a good example of this. The F24 data is a time coded feed that lists all player action events within the game with a player, team, event type, minute and second for each ac-predictable behavior). counts, means the ball is moving quicker), we used the to-tal count of entires as the entropy measure normalizes this information.
Evaluating team strategy is a very difficult task. The ma-jor hurdle to overcome is the absence of strategy labels. But given we know the team identity, and assuming that teams exhibit similar behaviors over time, we can treat the task as an identification problem. We can do this by answering using only ball movement information, can we accurately identify the most likely team?
We model team behavior using a codebook of past per-formances. If a team X  X  behavior is consistent, then previous matches will be a good predictor of future performances. For the experiments, we used 380 games of the season and used a leave-one-match-out cross validation strategy to max-imize training and testing data. Before we investigate the difference between home and away performances, we first need to obtain the best possible representation. To evalu-ate this, we wanted to see how effective event-labeled data was in discriminating between different teams, and if having Figure 5: The identification rate for correctly iden-tifying home performances using event-labeled data (i.e. no location information), occupancy maps (i.e. no event information, just location), and a combina-tion of the two. knowledge of where teams operate could boost the discrim-inating power.

To conduct the experiments, we compared our occupancy representation, to twenty-three match statistics currently used in analysis (e.g. passes, shots, tackles, fouls, aerials, possession, time-in-play etc.). We also combined the two inputs by concatenating the feature vectors. For classifica-tion, we used a k-Nearest Neighbor approach (with k = 30) and all experiments were conducted using D = 10  X  8 Figure 6: Confusion matrices of the team identifica-tion experiments using the combined representation. spatial areas (heuristically, we found those values of k and D gave the best performance). To reduce the dimensionality but maintain class separability for the spatiotemporal rep-resentation and the combined representation, we used linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We used the number of teams as classes ( C = 20), which resulted in a C  X  1 = 19 dimen-sional input feature, y = W T x , where W can be found via solving where  X  b and  X  w are the between-scatter and within-scatter matrices respectively. To test the various representations, only identity experiments on home performances were tested (home and away comparisons are be done next). Results for these experiments are shown in Figure 5. From this fig-ure, it can be seen using spatiotemporal data greatly im-proves the discriminability between different teams (19.26% vs 38.79%), and fusing the two together boosts performances again (46.70%). This result makes sense as the location of where teams play in addition to what they do should charac-terize their behavior. The confusion matrix of the combined representation shows that teams who play a similar style of-ten get confused with each other (e.g. the top 5 teams and teams 13-15) and from viewing the entropy maps in Figure 4, we can see that these teams look similar.
If a team plays in the same manner at home as they do away, the home model should be able to yield similar perfor-mance in identifying away matches as they do to the home matches. To test this theory, we used our home models to identify away performances and our away models to identify home performances. From the results (see Table 2), we can see that there is a drop in the hit-rate of the occupancy map representation  X  8.69% for the home model tested on the away matches and 6.07% on the reverse case. Even though not excessive, this drop in performance suggests there is a change in the spatial behavior between home and away per-formances.

To explore this aspect further, we visualized the difference in occupancy between the home and away performances. To Table 2: The hit rate accuracy of experiments which tested home (H) and away (A) models against home and away matches (e.g. HvH refers to home model tested on home matches and HvA refers to the home model being tested on away matches). do this, we simply subtracted the home occupancy maps from the away maps and divided by the away occupancy. The difference maps for all twenty teams is given in Figure 7 and it makes for compelling viewing. To make it easier to quantify the difference in occupancy, we calculated the dif-ference with respect to certain areas of the field. Specifically we calculated the difference: for the whole field (W), the at-tacking half (H), and the attacking-third (T) -these values are listed below each difference map. As can be seen from the difference maps, spatially, nearly all the teams (18 out of 20) had more possession in the attacking half and prob-ably more telling is that 19 out of the 20 teams had more possession in the attacking third. Seeing that the shoot-ing proficiency is essentially the same (10% vs 9%), we can point to the observation that the more possession in the at-tacking third leads to more chances, which in-turn leads to more goals. A potential statistic to back this observation up is that Chelsea -who were the only team to have less occupancy in the attacking third -had the smallest discrep-ancy between home and away shots (only 12, the next was Arsenal with 45).

With the absence of labels to compare against it is im-possible to say whether this was actually this case as other factors may have contributed to the home advantage (i.e. referee X  X  [22], shooting chance quality, game context (i.e. winning, losing, red-cards, key injury, derby matches etc.). However, through the use of spatiotemporal data, we can provide evidence of behavioral differences which can aid in the analysis of performance and decision making. This ap-proach can also be used to flag and predict individual team performances, and in the next section we show methods in which these can be applied.
Given a coach or analyst is preparing for an upcoming match, having a measure of how variable a team X  X  perfor-mance is would be quite beneficial. For example, the coach or analyst may have viewed a previous match and formed a qualitative model based on their expert observation. How-ever, this model is only formed by a single observation and may be subject to over-fitting. Having an measure which could indicate how variable a team X  X  performance is would be quite useful. Given they have a feature representation of each of the previous performances of a team, our approach could be a method of determining the performance variance. To do this, the distance in feature space between each of the past performances, y , and the mean,  X y , can be calculated where the mean is attacking third.) F igure 8: Variance in distortion for (a) home and (b) away performances. and where M is the number of previous performances. A distance measure such as the L 2 norm could be used given that the input space has been scaled appropriately (as is the case in our work), which generates the distance measure via where m refers to the game of interest. Returning to our home and away performance example, we can show the vari-ation in performance for each team in the EPL by finding the variance in distortion (Figure 9). As can be seen in this fig-ure, each team X  X  home performance has quite a low variance which gives an indication that when team X  X  play at home they do not vary their approach too much. Conversely, it seems that the away behavior is quite random so forecasting away performance may be unreliable.

In terms of post-match analysis, a similar approach could be used to see if a team X  X  performance was within the expec-tation range (i.e.  X   X  ). A good example was Fulham X  X  away performance against Manchester United. In this match, they lost 2-0 and conceded both goals in the first half (12th and 32nd minute). As can be seen by comparing both occu-pancy maps, in their match against Manchester United they occupied a lot more possession in the middle of the field then normal. This highlights the importance of context, as after scoring two early goals Manchester United sat back and allowed Fulham to have the majority of possession in non-threatening regions (52% of overall possession) [6]. To counter this, we would have to normalize for match con-text (i.e. score, strength of opposition etc.). However, this is a major problem as we would limit the amount of data we would have to train our model. Future work will be focussed on clustering styles unsupervised to maximize the amount of context dependent data. Distance from Mean Figure 9: Example of the distortion for each away performance of Fulham in the 2010-2011 season. In match 16 they played Manchester United, and the performance on the day was far different from their other away performances (they lost 2-0 on this oc-casion).
Most sports analytics approaches still only use event-labeled statistics to drive analysis and decision-making despite the influx of ball and player tracking data becoming available. The reason why this new and rich source of information is being neglected stems for the fact that it is continuous and is extremely difficult to segment into categories which would enable high-level analysis (e.g. team strategy labels). The emerging field of sports spatiotemporal analytics attempts to use spatiotemporal data such as ball and player track-ing data to drive automatic team behavior/strategy analysis which would be extremely useful in all facets of the sports industry (e.g. coaching, broadcasting, fantasy-games, video games, betting etc.). In this paper, we gave an overview of the types of sports analytics work being done both in industry as well as academia. Additionally, we gave a case-study which investigated possible reasons for why the home advantage exists in continuous sports like soccer. Using spa-tiotemporal data, we were able to show that teams at home play have more possession in the attacking third. Coupled with the fact that the shooting and passing proficiencies are not significantly different, this observation can partially ex-plain why home teams have more shots and score more, and in-turn win more at home compared to away matches. Using our feature representation, we also showed examples where pre and post game analysis can be performed. Specifically, we were able to show the variation in home and away perfor-mances for each team, as well as the ability to flag anomalous performances.

Our work also highlighted the importance of match con-text and the limiting factor it could have on training ex-amples. In our future work, we will look at unsupervised methods which cluster playing similar playing styles which can enrich our training data set, without effecting its dis-criminating power. Additionally, we are looking to extend this approach to focus on using player tracking information to discover team formations and plays. Predicting team in-teractions and subsequent performances and outcomes, es-pecially when they have not played each other is another area focus of our research. As reliable high-level labels are almost impossible to obtain, predicting match outcomes as our evaluation tool seems to be the best indicator of im-proved team modeling.
