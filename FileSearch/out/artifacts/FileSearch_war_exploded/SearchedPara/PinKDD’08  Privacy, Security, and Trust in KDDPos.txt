 This report summarizes the events of the 2 nd International Workshop on Privacy, Security, and Trust in KDD, at the 14 th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The workshop was held on August 24, 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada and brought together computer scientists working on how data protection issues factor into the context of data mining. The field of computer science is evolving to incorporate in-trinsically complex social and organizational environments. There is an ever-increasing demand for the incorporation of new technologies to gather data on people for a variety of worthwhile endeavors. Nowhere is this movement more ap-parent, and the influence of data mining professionals more critical, than in the often debated arenas of privacy, security, and trust. The increased collection and sharing of personal information for data mining endeavors raises complex so-cietal issues regarding data management and civil liberties. Ensuring data protection is essential for the provision of elec-tronic and knowledge-based services in modern e-business, e-commerce, e-government, and e-health environments. If insufficiently addressed, mishandling of the data will harm both the corresponding persons and data holders, leading to a loss in the public X  X  trust and legal action. To pre-vent such problems, computer scientists are developing novel techniques, as well as recasting cryptographic tools from the security domain, to simultaneously ensure privacy while fa-cilitating data mining projects.
 To inject privacy and trust into security and surveillance data mining projects, it is necessary to facilitate a dialogue between researchers and practitioners in the associated com-munities. Last year, we organized the first instantiation of this workshop (PinKDD X 07) to introduce researchers from disparate environments, including business, security, and theory to learn about the concerns and potential solutions regarding their challenges. This year X  X  workshop continued the integration of researchers investigating privacy, security, and issues of trust within a data mining framework. PinKDD X 08 received many high-quality research paper sub-missions, each of which was reviewed by a minimum of three members of the program committee. In all, six papers were selected for presentation at the workshop and inclusion in the workshop X  X  post-proceedings. At the workshop, the re-search presentations were grouped into two themes 1)  X  X ri-vacy protection through anonymity X  and 2)  X  X ttack and de-tection X  . In addition, the workshop included a keynote talk and an invited session on Geospatial Privacy Protection. The workshop began with a keynote talk delivered by Prof. Thuraisingham of the University of Texas at Dallas, enti-tled  X  X rivacy, Security and Trust for Data Mining  X  . Prof. Thuraisingham provided an overview of the relationships of data mining to privacy, security and trust. Prof. Thurais-ingham proceeded to summarize various solutions to the re-lated problems. This talk concluded by emphasizing the importance that policy makers, legal analysts, technologists, security experts and privacy advocates work together to de-velop flexible and practical solutions for data mining. The first research session focused on papers that addressed models and algorithms for the protection of personal privacy through data anonymization and distortion techniques. The first paper received the best paper award of PinKDD X 08, sponsored by Yahoo! Research. This work investigated pri-vacy protection in social networking research. Massive quan-tities of information provided by the users social network-ing domains is collected, stored, and may be used for vari-ous purposes. Technology and policy researchers alike have pointed out various privacy breaches that can arise from sharing of social network data. Though efforts have been made to protect such data from unauthorized disclosure, most data privacy research has focused on traditional data management models such as relational forms. Yet, unlike re-lational models, social networks contain relationships among individual entities. Campan et al. [1] developed a greedy algorithm for anonymizing a social network and introduced a structural measure to quantify the amount of information lost due to edge generalization in the anonymization process. Data distortion is a common technique in the field of pri-vacy preserving data mining. The premise of this technique is original data is hidden through the addition of noise from known distributions. Data mining models can then be built from the distorted data. Under this paradigm, Rachlin et al. [5] introduced a definition of guessing anonymity, which captures the difficulty of achieving an external linking at-tack. Based on this definition, methods were proposed to select the appropriate perturbation parameters for satisfy-ing a desired privacy protection. The second research session of the workshop was dedicated to papers that focused on frameworks and algorithms to detect malicious activities related to web-based applications, such as the detectiion of anomalies in web services and the development of attack models in recommender systems, and the detection of unknown malicious code.
 In the first paper, Li et al. [3] presented an efficient network anomaly detection method based on the k -nearest neigh-bor data mining algorithm. Their approach integrated ob-jective functions and anomaly impact metrics from the end users X  perspective to ensure the robustness of the web server anomaly detection mechanism. Li introduced a generic algo-rithm based on an instance selection mechanism to improve the real-time detection performance.
 In the second paper, Castellano et al. [2] presented a flexible framework, consisting of e-services and data mining compo-nents, for intrusion detection. The goal of the framework is to provide security managers with modular and flexible functionalities to resolve intrusion problems. In particu-lar, Castellano addressed a class of possible solutions based on knowledge discovery using data mining and web mining technologies. This work demonstrated how intrusion detec-tion systems can be built using the proposed framework. Malicious users can influence online recommendation sys-tems by providing biased data. Such attacks generally lead to the erosion of user trust in the objectivity and accuracy of the system. In the third paper, Ray et al. [6] presented new attack strategies that explore the importance of the targeted items and  X  X iller X  items. Unlike previous approaches, their strategies were built specifically for user-based and item-based collaborative filtering systems, with a particular focus on the intelligent selection of filler items. Empirical results demonstrated that the strategies may be effective against both types of filtering environments.
 The growth of network usage has motivated the creation of emerging malicious code for various purposes. Although signature-based anti-viruses methods are accurate, they can-not detect newly created malicious code. In the final paper, Moskovitch et al. [4] presented a methodology to detect un-known malicious code based on text categorization concepts. Through an active-learning framework, which enables the selection of unknown files for fast acquisition, the proposed methodology can be further improved to achieve a more ac-curate and efficient acquisition of unknown malicious files. The workshop concluded with an invited session on Geospa-tial Privacy Protection featuring two talks by Peter Chris-ten and Franco Turini, followed by an open discussion. Prof. Christen X  X  talk,  X  X eocode Matching and Privacy Preserva-tion X , started with a brief introduction to privacy preserving data matching and record linkage. Using a variety of real-world scenarios, the talk illustrated the multitude of privacy and confidentiality inherent in geocode matching. Next, Prof. Turini gave a talk entitled  X  X obility, Data Mining and Privacy X . The talk highlighted the results of a European-wide research project called GeoPKDD, EU-funded Geo-graphic Privacy-Aware Knowledge Discovery and Delivery (http://www.geopkdd.eu). During the delivery, particular attention was placed upon privacy-aware spatio-temporal data mining from mobility data generated by wireless net-works, mobile technologies, and ubiquitous computing.
