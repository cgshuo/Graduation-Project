 Although Navalpakkam and Itti (2006) do not explicitly introduce noise in their model, they do so place similar, somewhat arbitrary limitations on gain modulation. Baldwin and Mozer (2006) im-pose the restriction P Navalpakkam and Itti (2006) prefer the constraints P Finally, we mention one other key property the various models have in common. Gain tuning is performing optimization. The model we introduce in this paper makes three contributions over the class of Guided Search models previously proposed.

In reality, noise and nondeterminism serve to degrade the model X  X  performance over what it could otherwise result in the model performing worse than it otherwise could. Although limitations on gain mod-ulation might be neurobiologically rationalized, a more elegant account would characterize these executive control processes in the brain.
 Consequently, we refer to our model as experience-guided search or EGS .
