 Anna Formica  X  Elaheh Pourabbas Abstract In this paper we propose a method to measure the semantic similarity of geographic classes organized as partition hierarchies within Naive Geography . The contribu-tion of this work consists in extending and integrating the information content approach, and the method for comparing concept attributes in the ontology management system SymOntos developed at IASI. As a result, this proposal allows us to address both the concept similarity to reduce the gap among the different similarity approaches defined in the literature. Keywords Geographic class  X  Naive geography  X  Similarity reasoning  X  Partition hierarchy  X  Information content 1 Introduction Semantic similarity (or semantic proximity) consists of a field of study whereby a set of terms/concepts is assigned a metric based on the commonalities and differences of their semantic content. It covers wide areas and application domains in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, databases, and software engineering. Recently, this study is growing in importance in different settings, such as digital libraries, heterogeneous databases, and the World Wide Web.

The research on concept similarity is particularly relevant for the retrieval and integration of data within Geographic Information Systems (GISs) [ 42 ]. In fact, users of geographic data have different backgrounds and a very rich domain of concepts, due to the varieties in human languages for expressing and communicating geographic information. In the literature, a number of semantic similarity methods have been proposed. They refer essentially to map processes [ 29 ], spatial relationships [ 20 ], geospatial entity-classes [ 42 ], etc.
In this paper, the problem of semantic similarity of geographic classes is addressed. Geo-geometric types. Partitions are an important spatial concept, and are widely used in the gene-ration of many scale-dependent maps from single databases [ 18 , 40 ]. Examples of partitions in the real world are the subdivision of a given territory into administrative boundaries such this paper, we refer to territorial administrative partitions.

The proposed method, called GSim , has been defined by revisiting, extending, and inte-grating two approaches: (1) the information content approach as defined in [ 27 ], that is inspired by [ 38 ], and (2) a method for attribute similarity which is based on the maximum weighted matching problem in bipartite graphs, that has been proposed within the ontology management system SymOntos [ 15 ]. The latter is based on axiomatic similarity degrees for concept names ( axiomatic similarity ), that are established according to a consensus system by a panel of experts in the application domain. In this paper, attribute similarity has been extended and modified as explained below.

The contribution of this paper is manyfold. First, we define the notion of information content similarity ( ics ) by introducing the notion of SynSet , i.e., a set of synonyms for a attribute similarity is evaluated according to the notion of ics (rather than the axiomatic similarity defined in SymOntos ). Third, we address the similarity of typed attributes which was not defined in [ 15 ]. Fourth, in our approach we also include a similarity measure for geometric types, which is a first preliminary proposal to be refined in future work.
Our approach falls under the general area of Naive Geography [ 11 ] or common-sense geographic reasoning that is a field of study concerned to capture people X  X  concepts about space and time. The main task is to derive common sense definitions of geographic entities or classes (entities modeled in GIS) such that the classes are described by their essential properties. These properties cover three components of geographic information, which are spatial or geometric, thematic and temporal. The spatial or geometric component refers to the geographic coordinates of entities on Earth X  X  surface. The thematic component refers to vision, geomorphology), and temporal component refers to the variation of the spatial and thematic components over time. Research on spatial similarity is focused on the matching of the geometric properties of geographic objects. Some examples are content-based image on semantic similarity are addressed to capture the thematic properties of geographic classes beyond the spatial similarity and it is mainly oriented to achieve the common-sense definition of the GISs users through the semantic similarity in order to bridge the gap between user needs and the concepts provided from GIS.

Note that in the literature most of similarity models defined by computer scientists are based on the hierarchical structure of concepts, in contrast with the work of psychologists referred to as tuple similarity) of geographic classes. In this paper we focus on partition hierarchies, however our approach can also be applied to ISA hierarchies [ 1 , 16 ]. Our work score rather than being treated simply as different features. For implementation issues, we referred to WordNet taxonomy of concepts [ 52 ], however a more detailed lexical database for the English language can be adopted as well.

As a final remark, and as also mentioned by the authors in [ 42 ], we emphasize that the contentapproachisaninterestingresearchtopictoinvestigateforwhichtherearenoproposals in the literature. The contribution of this paper is just in this direction.

Our proposal can also be used to provide an approximate answer when the user expresses a query in terms of geographic classes that have no match or are missing in the database. For instance, if the user asks the list of hotels in the counties of USA, and the concept of the hierarchy, is proposed. Furthermore, suppose the user erroneously asks the list of hotels in the counties of Italy. Our method can be used to detect the most similar concept to county within the Italian administrative subdivisions, that is municipality.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we analyze different approaches to similarity measuring that have been proposed in the literature. In Sect. 3 , a preliminary informal presentation of the main characteristics of the geographic classes addressed in this describe the information content and tuple similarity methods. They will be then integrated in our proposal. A running example is also given throughout the paper. Finally, in Sect. 5 the experiment we have performed in order to evaluate our method is presented. We selected three among the most representative proposals in the literature, and the experiment shows that GSim has the highest correlation with human judgement. Section 6 concludes. 2 Related work In the domain of GISs, similarity is mainly discussed from the spatial point of view. This study originated from the increased availability of geographic data collected from satellite imagery and other remote sensors. Therefore, spatial similarity has been defined as matching and ranking according to a certain context (function, goal), scale (coarse o finer level), and technology (for searching, retrieving, and recognizing data). In particular, the research on interoperability [ 21 ], etc.

Similarityofconceptsandtheirrelationships,thatisthefocusofourpaper,hasbeenlargely discussed in the literature. Concerning the relationships, the following different types have been considered: associative (e.g., cause-effect), equivalence (or synonymy), hierarchical (e.g., ISA or hyperonym-hyponym, Part_of , etc.). The hierarchical relationship, particularly, has attracted a lot of interest in the research community since it has been considered very suitable for mapping the human cognitive view of classification (i.e., taxonomy).
The traditional approach to evaluate semantic similarity in a taxonomy is the so-called edge-counting approach [ 26 , 36 ], which corresponds to the semantic distance approach. The semantic distance is equal to the minimal path length between concepts. The main limitations of this approach are represented by the underlying assumptions that, often, are not explicitly defined and, in many realistic cases, it is difficult to define a taxonomy where the distances between any two adjacent nodes are equivalent.

In order to overcome the drawback of the edge-counting approach, another methodology has been introduced, namely the information content (or node-based approach) [ 38 , 39 ], which has been successively refined by [ 27 ]. This relies on the association of probabilities with the nodes of the taxonomy. The similarity between concepts is measured by the ratio between the amount of information shared by the concepts and the sum of the amounts of information of concepts. This approach is recalled in Sect. 4 and is the basis of the method for evaluating semantic similarity of geographic classes proposed in this paper. As also mentioned in [ 23 ], it shows a higher correlation with human judgement with respect to other existing proposals.

With regard to feature (or tuple) similarity, one of the most commonly used similarity feature vectors, and it is given by the ratio between the number of features that are common to two vectors and the sum of the numbers of the features of each vector. Note that the Dice X  X  function does not allow tuple similarity to be computed by explicitly considering the similarity degrees of components. Whereas, we address the similarity degrees of components through the notion of information content similarity (see Sects. 4 , 5 ).

Recently, few attempts have been performed to model geographic class similarity. For larity among geospatial entities that is based on the Tversky X  X  model [ 50 ]. According to such a model, the similarity is a linear combination of weighted shared features and weigh-ted distinct features. This method, called Matching-Distance Similarity Measure (MDSM), determines the similarity by using a matching process over synonym sets, semantic neigh-in [ 42 ], two different approaches, namely variability and commonality , for determining fea-tures X  relevance have been presented. Both these approaches will be used in our experiment on the cognitive properties of the semantic similarity assessment, and they do not address the similarity of the geometric properties of geographic entities. The model of Tversky has geographic categories (or entities). In particular, the problem of cross-mapping of geographic ontologies has been addressed and a systematic methodology for comparing categories has been presented.

To illustrate our proposal, we have selected MDSM, Dice, and Lin which are among the most representative methods defined in the literature (see Sect. 5 ).

Finally, we remark that our work is also a first attempt to integrate the geometric types of above. 3 The geographic data model We consider a simple object-oriented geographic data model. This is characterized by the notion of geographic class , which is informally defined below. Such a notion will be formally defined in the next subsection.

A geographic class describes a set of geographic objects having the same set of attributes (or properties ).Itisspecifiedbya name andaclass expression .Theclassexpressioncontains Each attribute is associated with an atomic type (e.g., integer , string ,etc.).Weassumeaset of geometric types is associated with a geographic class because in multiple-representation databases, or depending on the scale, this type may change (e.g., municipality as a polygon or municipality as a point ). For each geometric type a set of operations is defined. These operations, that can be either unary or binary, concern the topological relationships among been extensively discussed in [ 9 , 10 ] and go beyond the scope of this paper.
A geographic knowledge base is essentially a set of geographic classes where each class is identified by a name, and there are no dangling class names, i.e., every name is associated with a class expression.
 A geographic knowledge base can be organized according to a partition hierarchy. Such a hierarchy captures the well known is-in relationship or inclusion property. In the literature, basically, three different kinds of semantics for inclusion have been identified: class , meronymic ,and spatial [ 45 , 51 ]. Class inclusion is the standard subtype/supertype relationship which has been widely discussed in the database literature, and it is indicated have been carried out. One of the various semantics of meronymic relationships discussed in [ 45 ]isthe place-area . It concerns parts which are similar to whole, and they cannot be inclusion differs from place-area in that it represents objects that are surrounded by others but they are not part of them (as for instance, car is-in city).

In this paper, we consider the place-area semantics for the inclusion relationship that is more suitable for capturing the meaning of inclusion in the geographic context and, in par-chies. Note that the place-area semantics gives us the possibility of applying the information content approach of Resnik [ 38 ], conceived for ISA hierarchies, to partition hierarchies. Example 3.1 The following is a geographic class of name Country :
Country =[ name : string , having name , countryCode , president ,and flag as tuple of typed attributes, and polygon as the singleton containing the geometric type of the class. In the next subsection we will see that such a class can be disjunctively partitioned according to different administrative organizations, e.g., the geographic classes Region , State ,or Department . For instance, the countries Italy, USA, and France 1 are subdivided into regions, states, and departments, respectively. 3.1 Geographic knowledge base In the following we assume that countable sets N , A of class names and attribute names, respectively, are given. Let T and G be the sets of atomic and geometric types defined, respectively, as follows: T ={ string , integer , real , boolean }, G ={ point , polyline , polygon }.
 The notion of geographic class is defined below.
 and an expression as follows: where n is the name of the class from N ,the a j  X  X  are attribute names from A ,the  X  j  X  X  are types from T ,and G n  X  G is the set of geometric types of the class n .

Note that in the sequel, the term concept will be used to denote a class, an attribute, or a type name. Before introducing the notion of geographic knowledge base , the notion of partial order on partitions is given below.
 of E , i.e., P = E ,and  X  p , p  X  P , p  X  p = X  .Let P ( E ) be a set of partitions of E and be the following partial order on P ( E ) (indicated as ( P ( E ), )) : P P iff  X  p  X  P , p  X  P , p  X  p  X  X  p ,  X  X  .
 Example 3.2 Let E be a subset of the plane called Country , and consider a set of partitions defined as follows:
P ( Country )={ Region, State, Department, Province, County, Municipality } and the partial order on the above partitions: Municipality Pro v ince Pro v ince Region Region Country County State State Country
Department Country , as shown in Fig. 1 . As we mentioned before, Country is partitioned into three disjunctive partitions, called Region , State ,and Department . The first two are partitioned again into Pro v ince and County , respectively, and are related to Region ,and State by a partial order relationship. Similarly, Pro v ince into Municipality . In the following, the partial order on partition allows us to define the notion of Geographic knowledge base .
 Definition 3.3 ( Geographic knowledge base )Let E be a subsetof the plane and ( P ( E ), )be a partial order on the set of partitions of E .A geographic knowledge base E = ( C , A , Cls ) each n  X  C , n is the name of precisely one geographic class in Cls ,and Cls also contains a class expression of name E . Furthermore, C = P ( E ) . Then, ( P ( E ), )isreferredtoas P ar t _o f hierarchy of the geographic knowledge base E .
 Example 3.3 For instance, consider the set of partitions of Country of the previous example. A geographic knowledge base, called GeoKB , can be defined by the following set of geogra-phic classes:
Country =[ name : string , State =[ tag : string , countr yCode : integer , go v er nor : string ] , { polygon }
Municipality =[ identity : string , head _ of _ council : string ,
County =[ count y I D : integer , population : integer , Then, the hierarchy shown in Fig. 1 is the Part _ of hierarchy of the GeoK B example.
Note that the partition hierarchies on a single geographic class, e.g., Country ,areusedto generate and visualize 2D multi-scale representation. Hence, polygon is the common geome-tric type used to model these classes. However, some geographic entities, like Municipality , can be represented by point at a small scale map representation. In this paper, we focus on 2D representation of geographic classes. 3.2 Weighted part_of hierarchy a geographic knowledge base is introduced. It is essentially given by the Part _ of hierarchy of the geographic knowledge base enriched with a function which associates probabilities with the concepts (class, attribute or type names) defined in the hierarchy.
 Definition 3.4 ( Weighted Part_of hierarchy of a geographic knowledge base ) Given a geo-graphic knowledge base E , consider the Part _ of hierarchy of E and a function p asso-ciating each concept (class, attribute, or type name) c ,inthe Part _ of hierarchy of E , with the concept c . Furthermore, assume that the Part _ of hierarchy has a unique To p node X  the most abstract concept X  X uch that for each c , part O f ( Top , c ) holds, and p ( Top ) =1. Then the Part _ of hierarchy is referred to as a weighted Part_of hierarchy of the geographic knowledge base E , and it is indicated as H p . In the following, we refer to a hierarchy (taxonomy) of concepts represented by nouns in English. The frequencies of concepts are estimated using noun frequencies from large text corpora, as for instance the Brown Corpus of American English [ 17 ].
 The pr obabili t y p ( c ) of the concept c is defined as follows: where freq ( c ) is the frequency of the concept c ,and M is the total number of observed instances of nouns in the corpus.
 Example 3.4 In this paper, probabilities have been estimated according to SemCor project [ 14 ], which labels subsections of Brown Corpus to senses in the WordNet lexicon [ 52 ]. According to SemCor , the total number of observed instances of nouns is 88 , 312.
The definitions of the classes of our running example, and the related frequencies (the number in parenthesis) according to WordNet are given below: (276) Country  X  the territory occupied by a nation ; (67) Region  X  the extended spatial location of something ; (272) State  X  the territory occupied by one of the constituent administrative districts of a (34) County  X  the territory 2 created by administrative division for the purpose of local In Fig. 2 the weighted Part _ of hierarchy of the GeoK B example is shown. Note that, in WordNet the frequencies of the concepts Municipality and Department are not indicated, therefore, we assume they are equal to 1.

Before concluding this section, we need to introduce the notion of SynSet for a geogra-phic knowledge base E . It deals with synonyms, which have a fundamental importance in evaluating concept similarity since they are concepts differing in the names while having the same meaning.
 Definition 3.5 ( Set of synonyms for a geographic knowledge base )Givenageographicknow-ledge base E = ( C , A , Cls ) ,let B i  X  N  X  A , i =1,..., n , be sets of synonyms according to a lexical database for the English language. Then, SynSet is a (possibly empty) set of synonyms for the geographic knowledge base E if: and B i  X  ( C  X  A ) = X  ,for i = 1 ,..., n .
 In this paper, for homogeneity, we again refer to the set of synonyms provided by WordNet .
 Example 3.5 The following set, namely SynSet GeoK B , is a set of synonyms for the geogra-phic knowledge base GeoK B , which has been defined according to WordNet (we focus on the following set for lack of space): { name , label , tag , identity , mark } , { sur f ace , area } { population , inhabitant , d w eller , denizen , ind w eller } } 4 Class similarity hierarchies is addressed. The proposed method is based on three notions, namely the infor-(  X 
Sim ). In particular, ics is devoted to compute the similarity between class names, attribute names, and atomic types, tSim is conceived to measure the similarity of tuples of typed attributes, and  X  Sim allows us to evaluate the similarity of sets of geometric types. Such notions are presented below, and in Sect. 4.3 they are combined to obtain the notion of GSim .
Note that, the formal properties of concept similarity depend on the selected data model, e.g., the geometric model ,the featural model ,the network model ,etc.[ 32 ]. Among these model of Tversky [ 50 ] is neither dimensional nor metric and, consequently, symmetry and transitivity do not necessarily hold. Since our approach focuses on geographic classes orga-network model and other frameworks for measuring similarity between and within ontologies (see for instance [ 13 ]). 4.1 Information content similarity The notion of information content similarity allows us to compute the similarity of class, attribute,andatomictypenames.Itisbasedonthedefinitionof semantic similarity ,previously is that the information content of a concept (class, attribute, or type name) c is defined as  X  therefore the more abstract a concept, the lower its information content [ 43 ]. According to the Resnik X  X  approach, the similarity of hierarchically organized concepts, Sim R ,isgivenby the maximum information content shared by the concepts, that is, the more information two is defined by the information content of the concept that is the least upper bound ( lub )of c defined according to Lin as the maximum information content shared by the concepts ( Sim R ) divided by the information contents of the comparing concepts. This is formally defined by states that the ics of two concept names is equal to 1 if they coincide or are synonyms, and in all the other cases, their similarity is equal to zero (point 3).
 Definition 4.1 ( Information content similarity, ics ) Given a geographic knowledge base
E = ( C , A , Cls ) , a weighted Part _ of hierarchy H p and a SynSet = { B 1 ,..., B n } , n 1. if n 1 = n 2 or n 1 , n 2  X  B k  X  SynSet ,forsome k ,1  X  k  X  n : 2. if n 1 , n 2  X  C  X  A and n 1 , n 2 /  X  B k  X  SynSet ,forany k : 3. otherwise: Example 4.1 In our running example consider the Pro v ince and County classes. The fol-lowing holds:
Note that, as already mentioned, according to Lin X  X  approach the maximum information content shared by the classes and the information contents of the classes to be compared are both considered. This is not true if we adopt Resnik X  X  approach for which, for instance, the similarity ( Sim R ) between Pro v ince and County and the similarity between Municipality and County coincide. In fact, both pairs share the same maximum information content, that is provided by Country , i.e.:
Sim R ( Pro v ince , County ) = Sim R ( Municipality , County ) = X  log p ( Country ) ,as it is easy to see in Fig. 2 . 4.2 Tuple similarity The tuple similarity ( tSim ) is inspired by a method based on the maximum weighted matching problem in bipartite graphs [ 15 , 19 ]. Below, we start by presenting the notion of candidate have to be considered in order to maximize the sum of the ics of the pairs. This method is in line with other feature-based approaches, as for instance, the Dice X  X  function [ 4 ]. As explicitly considering the similarity degrees of components whereas, in our proposal, they are addressed by integrating the notion of ics in the tSim .
 phic knowledge base defined as follows: n 1 = [ a 1 :  X  1 ,..., a h :  X  h ] , G 1 , h  X  1, n 2 = [ b 1 :  X  1 ,..., b k :  X  k ] , G 2 , k  X  1, where h  X  k and:
A ( n 1 ) = possible sets of h pairs of attribute names, as follows: sets of pairs of attributes (each pair formed by attributes not belonging to the same class), such that there are no two pairs of attributes sharing an element. For instance, assume that A ( pairs defines a possible set of marriages (when polygamy is not allowed) [ 19 ].
The notion of tuple similarity of two geographic classes n 1 , n 2 isbasedonthesetof candidate sets of pairs P ( n 1 , n 2 ) , as defined below.
 tSim ( n 1 , n 2 ) , is defined as follows: tSim ( n 1 , n 2 ) =
As mentioned in the Introduction, tSim has been inspired by the definition of attribute that is established according to a consensus system by a panel of experts in the application domain. In tSim , as has been replaced with ics . In addition, in SymOntos the similarity of types is not addressed. (Therefore, in place of the product of the ics above, in SymOntos we simply have as ( a , b ) ).
 Example 4.2 Consider the geographic classes Municipality and Department . In this case, k = 5and h = 4. One possible set of four pairs of attributes that maximizes the above formula is the following: { identity , name , head _ of _ council ,w ineZone , inhabitant , d w eller , In fact, according to Definition 4.1 ,wehave: ics ( identity , name )= ics ( inhabitant , d w eller )=1 as defined in the SynSet GeoK B of Example 3.5 , and, of course: ics ( area , area ) = 1, whereas: ics ( head _ of _ council ,w ineZone ) = 0.
 Therefore (recall that k = 5): tSim ( Municipality , Department ) = Note that, another possible set that maximizes the sum above contains the pair countr yCode ,w ineZone in place of head _ of _ council ,w ineZone (in fact ics ( countr yCode , w ineZone )=0). 4.3 Geographic class similarity Before introducing the notion of geographic class similarity ( GSim ), we need to present the notion of geometric type similarity (  X  Sim ). The latter allows us to measure the similarity of the sets of the geometric types of two geographic classes. We remark that within Naive Geography the similarity of geometric types is not addressed, and this is a first preliminary proposal to be extended in future work.
 Definition 4.4 ( Geometric type similarity,  X  Sim ) Consider two sets of geometric types, G 1 follows:
In our running example, consider the classes County and Municipality . Since the inter-section of the sets of the geometric types of these classes (which are { polygon }and{ point , polygon }, respectively) is non-empty, then  X  Sim ( County , Municipality ) = 1.
Now, the notion of GSim presented below can be defined on the basis of the information content similarity and the tuple similarity presented in the previous subsections, and the  X  Sim above.
 Definition 4.5 ( Geographic class similarity, GSim )Let E = ( C , A , Cls ) be a geographic knowledge base, consider a weighted Part _ of hierarchy H p ,a SynSet = { B 1 ,..., B n } , n  X  0, for E , and two geographic classes of E , of names n 1 , n 2 , respectively defined as follows: n 1 = [ a 1 :  X  1 ,..., a h :  X  h ] , G 1 , h  X  1, n 2 = [ b 1 :  X  1 ,..., b k :  X  k ] , G 2 , k  X  1, and suppose that h  X  k . Then, the geographic class similarity of n 1 , n 2 , indicated as GSim ( n 1 , n 2 ) , is defined as follows:
GSim ( n 1 , n 2 ) = ics where ics is the information content similarity of class names n 1 , n 2 , tSim is the tuple similarity, w p and w a are weights, such that w p + w a = 1, expressing the relevance to be geometric type similarity defined above.

In the definition above, if w a is equal to 0 then GSim is given by the shared information In contrast to the previous case, if w p is equal to zero then GSim corresponds to the tuple types in tSim , and viceversa for w a .

It is important to note that the evaluation of the tuning parameters is a complex problem where features stand for attributes, parts, or functions. Such a proposal is based on two different approaches, namely variability and commonality . This problem is related to that of hierarchical (parts) and attribute components of a knowledge base within a given domain. For this reason, in this paper we determine w p and w a in line with both the variability and commonality approaches defined in [ 42 ]. In the following these approaches are briefly or parts.

According to the variability approach, the relevance of a feature is related to the feature X  X  phic classes in the knowledge base. Viceversa, according to the commonality approach, high frequency of a feature corresponds to high relevance. Given a geographic knowledge base, (where v stands for variability and c for commonality , respectively) be defined as follows: where o i is the number of occurrences of a feature in the geographic knowledge base, n is the number of geographic classes and m is the number of features in the geographic knowledge base. According to the variability approach, the weights are determined as follows: whereas, according to the commonality approach: By focusing on our running example, the number of geographic classes is n = 7, in the case of parts m = 7, and in the case of attributes m = 13. Therefore, the following holds: The semantic similarity measure proposed in this paper can be used to perform query approxi-mation in GISs. For example, when querying a geographic database, the user can express a query in terms of geographic classes that have no match in the database. Therefore, approxi-mate queries can be formulated by replacing the missing concepts with similar ones, which are then proposed to the user as acceptable.
 Example 4.3 Suppose that the user wants to know  X  X ll the hotels of the counties in Italy X , but he/she is not aware about the Italian administrative subdivisions. In order to provide an approximate answer, the database can be coupled with the partition hierarchy of Fig. 2 . Hence, three geographic classes Region , Pro v ince and Municipality are proposed to the user, with the related similarity scores with County . In the following, let GSim v and GSim c be the GSim measure computed by assuming w p = w v p = 0 . 46 and w a = w v a = 0 . 54 (the variability approach) and w p = w c p = 0 . 59 and w a = w c a = 0 . 41 (the commonality approach). The following holds: GSim v ( Municipality , County ) = ( 0 . 5993  X  0 . 46 + 0 . 40  X  0 . 54 )  X  1 = 0 . 4917,
GSim c ( Municipality , County ) = ( 0 . 5993  X  0 . 59 + 0 . 40  X  0 . 41 )  X  1 = 0 . 5176, where: ics ( Municipality , County ) = tSim ( Municipality , County ) = and, as shown previously:  X  Sim ( Municipality , County ) = 1.
 Consider now the Pro v ince and County classes. In this case:
GSim v ( Pro v ince , County ) = ( 0 . 6458  X  0 . 46 + 0  X  0 . 54 )  X  1 = 0 . 2971,
GSim c ( Pro v ince , County ) = ( 0 . 6458  X  0 . 59 + 0  X  0 . 41 )  X  1 = 0 . 3810, where: ics ( Pro v ince , County ) = tSim ( Pro v ince , County ) =  X  Sim ( Municipality , County ) = 1.
 If we consider the Region and County classes, then we have: GSim v ( Region , County ) = ( 0 . 7667  X  0 . 46 + 0  X  0 . 54 )  X  1 = 0 . 3527,
GSim c ( Region , County ) = ( 0 . 7667  X  0 . 59 + 0  X  0 . 41 )  X  1 = 0 . 4524, where: ics ( Region , County ) = tSim ( Region , County ) =  X  Sim ( Municipality , County ) = 1.
 As we can see, according to both the variability and the commonality approaches, within the Italian administrative subdivisions the most similar concept to County is Municipality . if, according to his/her opinion, they are more appropriate. 5 Experimental results In this section, we present the experiment we have performed to evaluate our proposal. We have compared the similarity values obtained with GSim against that obtained according Dice X  X  function [ 4 ], and (3) the Matching-Distance Similarity Measure (MDSM) [ 42 ]. Before illustrating our experiment, the Dice X  X  function and the MDSM X  X  method are briefly recalled below. 5.1 Dice and MDSM methods defined as follows: where: Af f is the set of sets of attributes showing affinity that is computed similar to the maximum For instance, consider Municipality and State . The number of pairs of attributes showing affinity are ( identity , tag ), and ( countr yCode , countr yCode ). Therefore:
Regarding MDSM, the similarity measure is a weighted sum of the similarity measures for parts , functions and attributes , that are the distinguishing features of spatial entity classes in [ 42 ]. Given two classes a , b , their similarity according to MDSM, indicated as MDSM ( a , b ) , is defined as follows: and w p , w f ,and w a are weights defining the relative importance of parts, functions, and attributes, such that w p + w f + w a =1, which are defined according to the variability and commonality approaches. The definitions of w p and w a have been recalled in Sect. 4.3 , respectively. Then, the following holds: where A  X  B and A  X  B are the set-theory intersection and difference of the sets A , B , respectively, and 0  X   X ( a , b )  X  1 is a function defining the  X  X elative importance X  of the non-common characteristics of the classes. Such a function is essentially defined in terms of the distance among the classes a , b and the class representing their least upper bound in the hierarchy, where the distance is given by the number of arcs along the shortest path between classes (for details, see [ 42 ]).
 Inourexperimentalresults,sincefunctionsarenotpresent,wefocusonpartsandattributes. For instance, in the case of Municipality and State ,  X ( Municipality , State ) = 0 . 25 because their least upper bound is Country . Furthermore, assume that A and B are the sets of attributes of Municipality and State , respectively. Then: Dice X  X  function, are synonyms), and ( countr yCode , countr yCode ). Furthermore, the set differences are respectively: therefore: For parts we have: By indicating with MDSM v and MDSM c the MDSM measure calculated according to the variability and commonality approaches respectively, since w v p = 0 . 46, w v a = 0 . 54, and 5.2 The experiment In our experiment we computed the similarity values for all pairs of geographic classes of our running example according to Lin, Dice, tSim ,MDSMand GSim (for the last two by following both the variability and commonality approaches defined in [ 42 ]). In order to evaluate the various proposals, we had to address the problem related to the so-called  X  X deal X  (or  X  X ight X ) values. In general, idealvalues are established according to human judgementand, experiments are addressed [ 30 ]. It is important to observe that our proposal originates by papers it has already been shown that Lin X  X  approach shows a higher correlation with human judgement, and therefore provides better results, than other  X  X ierarchy-centered X  methods, including the traditional edge-counting approach [ 36 ].

In the experiment we performed, ideal values have been established by asking 24 students to asses the similarity among all pairs of geographic classes of our running example. Students can be obtained from the GeoK B of Example 3.3 . For each pair, the average of these values is shown in the second column of Table 1 (Human Judgement, HJ). Besides the similarity scores obtained according to Lin, Dice, and tSim ,Table 1 also shows MDSM v ,MDSM c , as determined in the previous section.

For each similarity method, the highest similarity scores among a class and the remaining six classes in the geographic knowledge base are shown in italic. Note that similarity in MDSM is asymmetric, see for instance the values of MDSM v for the pairs ( Municipality , Pro v ince )(0 . 18) and ( Pro v ince , Municipa lity )(0 . 57). The same also holds for human judgement, see for instance the slightly difference between the values of ( Municipality , highest scores with human judgement, Lin provides the best result (6 correct matches), against GSim c (4 correct matches), Dice and tSim (3 correct matches), and MDSM v ,MDSM c ,and GSim v (2 correct matches). However, as shown in the last row of Table 1 , the highest correlation with human answers is provided by GSim c (0 . 82). In the case of GSim v ,we have a slightly higher correlation with human judgement (0 . 72) with respect to Lin (0 . 71).
Note that, in most cases, the values obtained according to GSim are greater than the values computed according to Dice and MDSM, and they are less than the measures calculated according to the information content approach by Lin. The reason is that, on one hand, our method captures the informativeness of geographic classes organized as a hierarchy, while Dice and MDSM are mainly based on the common and non-common characteristics of classes. For instance, in some cases the values obtained by Dice and MDSM are equal to zero. This indicates that there are no common features between the considered pairs of classes. On the other hand, similar to Dice and MDSM, our approach considers the structures similarity values that are considerably less than the ones obtained according to Lin.
Table 1 shows how the similarity scores significantly differ by following the hierarchy-centered approach of Lin or the feature-centered approaches of Dice or MDSM. The aim of GSim is just to reduce the gap between the hierarchy-centered and the feature-centered methods proposed in the literature. In fact it has been conceived for knowledge bases where concepts are hierarchically organized and, at the same time, are associated with sets of attributes. For instance, consider the pairs of classes ( Municipality , Region )and ( Municipality , County ) and analyze their values according to Table 1 .Since Region is the hierarchy-centered approach of Lin is greater than the similarity between Municipality and County , i.e., 0.77 and 0.60, respectively. On the other hand, Municipality share with County one more attribute with respect to Region (taking into account also synonyms) then, the similarity of ( Municipality , County )and( Municipality , Region ) according to the ned according to MDSM v , i.e., 0.28 versus 0.18, and MDSM c , i.e., 0.22 versus 0.14. Accor-dingly, tSim of ( Municipality , County ) is greater than tSim of the pair ( Municipality , Region ) (0.40 versus 0.20), whereas in the case of GSim v and GSim c we have closer results, i.e., 0.49 versus 0.46, and 0 . 52 versus 0 . 54, respectively. 6 Conclusion and future work In this paper, we focused our attention on the semantic similarity of geographic classes orga-nized as Part_of hierarchies. We have proposed a method for similarity measuring which takes into account both the concept similarity within the Part _ of hierarchy (through the information content approach) and the tuple similarity (through the sets of typed attributes). The proposed method takes advantage of the information-theoretic notion of similarity which overcomes the drawbacks of the traditional edge-counting approach and, accordingly, pro-vides more reliable measures for comparing geographic classes. The information content approach relies on taxonomies of concepts that can be acquired from WordNet or more detailed lexical databases for the English language.

A direction for future research is to extend the proposed method to the dynamic component data.
