The motivation of Information Retrieval is to be able to fi with only few keywords that adequately capture the intended information need. For this, is geared towards identifying the most descriptive tags for business process models. with each business process model a tag characterization of the form [ a process model that are searchable later on (cf.

For instance, the modeler is interested in process models starting with for instance send request . 3.2. Extended search optional search criteria that further limit the query results (see Fig. 4 ). 3.2.1. Process design cost and quality
A process design P , a business process model in our context, is a set of ordered pairs ( a where a i isa process activityand  X  i is thestartingtimeof a of time where activity a i is executed.). Each process activity a e.g., ( v i ,cost , v i ,quality ) for cost and quality of the process design.
The evaluation of the process model design in attribute k is obtained from the evaluation v process model design via an aggregation function f 1 done with the function f cost .

The cost function for the process design is de fi ned as follows: where f cost is the sum of design costs of all process activities in the design. For attributes like cost, f all activities contained in the design. Thus, given a set R ={ P we are interested in the P i with the lowest costs of a process design, i.e., min the lowest quality of any process activity included in the process design: where f quality is the quality of the process design. Here, for a set R ={ P the query, we are interested in the P j with the highest quality of a process design, i.e., max
