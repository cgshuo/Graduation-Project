 Learning multiple languages together should be easier than learning them separately. For exam-ple, in the domain of syntactic parsing, a range of recent work has exploited the mutual constraint between two languages X  parses of the same bi-text (Kuhn, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Kuz-man et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Sny-der et al., 2009a). Moreover, Snyder et al. (2009b) in the context of unsupervised part-of-speech in-duction (and Bouchard-C  X ot  X e et al. (2007) in the context of phonology) show that extending be-yond two languages can provide increasing ben-efit. However, multitexts are only available for limited languages and domains. In this work, we consider unsupervised grammar induction without bitexts or multitexts. Without translation exam-ples, multilingual constraints cannot be exploited at the sentence token level. Rather, we capture multilingual constraints at a parameter level, us-ing a phylogeny-structured prior to tie together the various individual languages X  learning problems. Our joint, hierarchical prior couples model param-eters for different languages in a way that respects knowledge about how the languages evolved.

Aspects of this work are closely related to Co-hen and Smith (2009) and Bouchard-C  X ot  X e et al. (2007). Cohen and Smith (2009) present a model for jointly learning English and Chinese depen-dency grammars without bitexts. In their work, structurally constrained covariance in a logistic normal prior is used to couple parameters between the two languages. Our work, though also differ-ent in technical approach, differs most centrally in the extension to multiple languages and the use of a phylogeny. Bouchard-C  X ot  X e et al. (2007) consid-ers an entirely different problem, phonological re-construction, but shares with this work both the use of a phylogenetic structure as well as the use of log-linear parameterization of local model com-ponents. Our work differs from theirs primarily in the task (syntax vs. phonology) and the vari-ables governed by the phylogeny: in our model it is the grammar parameters that drift (in the prior) rather than individual word forms (in the likeli-hood model).

Specifically, we consider dependency induction in the DMV model of Klein and Manning (2004). Our data is a collection of standard dependency data sets in eight languages: English, Dutch, Dan-ish, Swedish, Spanish, Portuguese, Slovene, and Chinese. Our focus is not the DMV model itself, which is well-studied, but rather the prior which couples the various languages X  parameters. While some choices of prior structure can greatly com-plicate inference (Cohen and Smith, 2009), we choose a hierarchical Gaussian form for the drift term, which allows the gradient of the observed data likelihood to be easily computed using stan-dard dynamic programming methods.

In our experiments, joint multilingual learning substantially outperforms independent monolin-gual learning. Using a limited phylogeny that only couples languages within linguistic families reduces error by 5.6% over the monolingual base-line. Using a flat, global phylogeny gives a greater reduction, almost 10%. Finally, a more articu-lated phylogeny that captures both inter-and intra-family effects gives an even larger average relative error reduction of 21.1%. We define our model over two kinds of random variables: dependency trees and parameters. For each language  X  in a set L , our model will generate a collection t that these dependency trees are generated by the DMV model of Klein and Manning (2004), which we write as t i of the various model parameters for language  X  . The prior is what couples the  X  across languages; it is the focus of this work. We first consider the likelihood model before moving on to the prior. 2.1 Dependency Model with Valence A dependency parse is a directed tree t over tokens in a sentence s . Each edge of the tree specifies a directed dependency from a head token to a de-pendent, or argument token. The DMV is a gen-erative model for trees t , which has been widely used for dependency parse induction. The ob-served data likelihood, used for parameter estima-tion, is the marginal probability of generating the observed sentences s , which are simply the leaves of the trees t . Generation in the DMV model in-volves two types of local conditional probabilities: CONTINUE distributions that capture valence and ATTACH distributions that capture argument selec-tion.

First, the Bernoulli CONTINUE probability dis-fertility of a particular head type h . The outcome c  X  X  stop, continue } is conditioned on the head type h , direction dir , and adjacency adj . If a head type X  X  continue probability is low, tokens of this type will tend to generate few arguments.

Second, the ATTACH multinomial probability distributions P ATTACH ( a | h, dir ;  X  ment preferences of heads, where a and h are both token types. We take the same approach as pre-vious work (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009) and use gold part-of-speech labels as tokens. Thus, the basic observed  X  X ord X  types are actually word classes. 2.1.1 Log-Linear Parameterization The DMV X  X  local conditional distributions were originally given as simple multinomial distribu-tions with one parameter per outcome. However, they can be re-parameterized to give the following log-linear form (Eisner, 2002; Bouchard-C  X ot  X e et al., 2007; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010): The parameters are weights  X  vector per language. In the case where the vec-tor of feature functions f has an indicator for each possible conjunction of outcome and conditions, the original multinomial distributions are recov-ered. We refer to these full indicator features as the set of S PECIFIC features. 2.2 Phylogenetic Prior The focus of this work is coupling each of the pa-rameters  X  sider a phylogeny like the one shown in Fig-ure 1, where each modern language  X  in L is a leaf. We would like to say that the leaves X  pa-rameter vectors arise from a process which slowly drifts along each branch. A convenient choice is to posit additional parameter variables  X  guages, and to assume that the conditional dis-tribution P (  X  logeny is a Gaussian centered on  X  par(  X  ) is the parent of  X  in the phylogeny and  X  of the Gaussian would then determine how much drift (and in what directions) is expected. Con-cretely, we assume that each drift distribution is an isotropic Gaussian with mean  X  thus defined a joint distribution P ( X  |  X  2 ) where  X  = (  X   X  :  X   X  L  X  L + ) .  X  2 is a hyperparameter for this prior which could itself be re-parameterized to depend on branch length or be learned; we simply set it to a plausible constant value.

Two primary challenges remain. First, infer-ence under arbitrary priors can become complex. However, in the simple case of our diagonal co-variance Gaussians, the gradient of the observed data likelihood can be computed directly using the DMV X  X  expected counts and maximum-likelihood estimation can be accomplished by applying stan-dard gradient optimization methods. Second, while the choice of diagonal covariance is effi-cient, it causes components of  X  that correspond to features occurring in only one language to be marginally independent of the parameters of all other languages. In other words, only features which fire in more than one language are coupled by the prior. In the next section, we therefore in-crease the overlap between languages X  features by using coarse projections of parts-of-speech. 2.3 Projected Features With diagonal covariance in the Gaussian drift terms, each parameter evolves independently of the others. Therefore, our prior will be most informative when features activate in multiple languages. In phonology, it is useful to map phonemes to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) in order to have a language-independent parameterization. We introduce a similarly neu-tral representation here by projecting language-specific parts-of-speech to a coarse, shared inven-tory.

Indeed, we assume that each language has a dis-tinct tagset, and so the basic configurational fea-tures will be language specific. For example, when an English VBZ takes a left argument headed by a NNS , a feature will activate specific to VBZ -NNS -LEFT . That feature will be used in the log-linear attachment probability for English. However, be-cause that feature does not show up in any other language, it is not usefully controlled by the prior. Therefore, we also include coarser features which activate on more abstract, cross-linguistic config-urations. In the same example, a feature will fire indicating a coarse, direction-free NOUN -VERB at-tachment. This feature will now occur in multiple languages and will contribute to each of those lan-guages X  attachment models. Although such cross-lingual features will have different weight param-eters in each language, those weights will covary, being correlated by the prior.

The coarse features are defined via a projec-tion  X  from language-specific part-of-speech la-bels to coarser, cross-lingual word classes, and hence we refer to them as S HARED features. For each corpus used in this paper, we use the tagging annotation guidelines to manually define a fixed mapping from the corpus tagset to the following coarse tagset: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, con-junction, preposition, determiner, interjection, nu-meral, and pronoun. Parts-of-speech for which this coarse mapping is ambiguous or impossible are not mapped, and do not have corresponding S HARED features.
 We summarize the feature templates for the CONTINUE and ATTACH conditional distributions in Table 1. Variants of all feature templates that ignore direction and/or adjacency are included. In practice, we found it beneficial for all language-independent features to ignore direction.

Again, only the coarse features occur in mul-tiple languages, so all phylogenetic influence is through those. Nonetheless, the effect of the phy-logeny turns out to be quite strong. 2.4 Learning We now turn to learning with the phylogenetic prior. Since the prior couples parameters across languages, this learning problem requires param-eters for all languages be estimated jointly. We seek to find  X  = (  X  optimizes log P ( X  | s ) , where s aggregates the ob-served leaves of all the dependency trees in all the languages. This can be written as The third term is a constant and can be ignored. The first term can be written as log P ( X ) = X where C is a constant. The form of log P ( X ) im-mediately shows how parameters are penalized for being different across languages, more so for lan-guages that are near each other in the phylogeny. The second term is a sum of observed data likelihoods under the standard DMV models for each language, computable by dynamic programming (Klein and Manning, 2004). Together, this yields the following objective function: which can be optimized using gradient methods or (MAP) EM. Here we used L-BFGS (Liu et al., 1989). This requires computation of the gradient of the observed data likelihood log P ( s which is given by: The expected gradient of the log joint likelihood of sentences and parses is equal to the gradient of the log marginal likelihood of just sentences, or the observed data likelihood (Salakhutdinov et al., 2003). e number of times head h is attached to a in direc-tion dir given the observed sentences s parameters  X  larly. Note that these are the same expected counts required to perform EM on the DMV, and are com-putable by dynamic programming.

The computation time is dominated by the com-putation of each sentence X  X  posterior expected counts, which are independent given the parame-ters, so the time required per iteration is essentially the same whether training all languages jointly or independently. In practice, the total number of it-erations was also similar. 3.1 Data We ran experiments with the following languages: English, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Spanish, Por-tuguese, Slovene, and Chinese. For all languages but English and Chinese, we used corpora from the 2006 CoNLL-X Shared Task dependency parsing data set (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006). We used the shared task training set to both train and test our models. These corpora provide hand-labeled part-of-speech tags (except for Dutch, which is auto-matically tagged) and provide dependency parses, which are either themselves hand-labeled or have been converted from hand-labeled parses of other kinds. For English and Chinese we use sections 2-21 of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) and sections 1-270 of the Chinese Tree-bank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2002) respectively. Sim-ilarly, these sections were used for both training and testing. The English and Chinese data sets have hand-labeled constituency parses and part-of-speech tags, but no dependency parses. We used the Bikel Chinese head finder (Bikel and Chiang, 2000) and the Collins English head finder (Collins, 1999) to transform the gold constituency parses into gold dependency parses. None of the corpora are bitexts. For all languages, we ran experiments on all sentences of length 10 or less after punctua-tion has been removed.

When constructing phylogenies over the lan-guages we made use of their linguistic classifica-tions. English and Dutch are part of the West Ger-manic family of languages, whereas Danish and Swedish are part of the North Germanic family. Spanish and Portuguese are both part of the Ibero-Romance family. Slovene is part of the Slavic family. Finally, Chinese is in the Sinitic family, and is not an Indo-European language like the oth-ers. We interchangeably speak of a language fam-ily and the ancestral node corresponding to that family X  X  root language in a phylogeny. 3.2 Models Compared We evaluated three phylogenetic priors, each with a different phylogenetic structure. We compare with two monolingual baselines, as well as an all-pairs multilingual model that does not have a phy-logenetic interpretation, but which provides very similar capacity for parameter coupling. 3.2.1 Phylogenetic Models The first phylogenetic model uses the shallow phy-logeny shown in Figure 2(a), in which only lan-guages within the same family have a shared par-ent node. We refer to this structure as F AMILIES . Under this prior, the learning task decouples into independent subtasks for each family, but no reg-ularities across families can be captured.

The family-level model misses the constraints between distant languages. Figure 2(b) shows an-other simple configuration, wherein all languages share a common parent node in the prior, meaning that global regularities that are consistent across all languages can be captured. We refer to this structure as G LOBAL .

While the global model couples the parameters for all eight languages, it does so without sensi-tivity to the articulated structure of their descent. Figure 2(c) shows a more nuanced prior struc-ture, L INGUISTIC , which groups languages first by family and then under a global node. This structure allows global regularities as well as reg-ularities within families to be learned. 3.2.2 Parameterization and A LL P AIRS Model Daum  X e III (2007) and Finkel and Manning (2009) consider a formally similar Gaussian hierarchy for domain adaptation. As pointed out in Finkel and Manning (2009), there is a simple equivalence be-tween hierarchical regularization as described here and the addition of new tied features in a  X  X lat X  model with zero-meaned Gaussian regularization on all parameters. In particular, instead of param-eterizing the objective in Section 2.4 in terms of multiple sets of weights, one at each node in the phylogeny (the hierarchical parameterization , de-scribed in Section 2.4), it is equivalent to param-eterize this same objective in terms of a single set of weights on a larger of group features (the flat parameterization ). This larger group of features contains a duplicate set of the features discussed in Section 2.3 for each node in the phylogeny, each of which is active only on the languages that are its descendants. A linear transformation between pa-rameterizations gives equivalence. See Finkel and Manning (2009) for details.

In the flat parameterization, it seems equally reasonable to simply tie all pairs of languages by adding duplicate sets of features for each pair. This gives the A LL P AIRS setting, which we also compare to the tree-structured phylogenetic mod-els above. 3.3 Baselines To evaluate the impact of multilingual constraint, we compared against two monolingual baselines. The first baseline is the standard DMV with only S PECIFIC features, which yields the standard multinomial DMV ( weak baseline ). To facilitate comparison to past work, we used no prior for this monolingual model. The second baseline is the DMV with added S HARED features. This model includes a simple isotropic Gaussian prior on pa-West Germanic North Germanic Ibero-Romance rameters. This second baseline is the more direct comparison to the multilingual experiments here ( strong baseline ). 3.4 Evaluation For each setting, we evaluated the directed de-pendency accuracy of the minimum Bayes risk (MBR) dependency parses produced by our mod-els under maximum (posterior) likelihood parame-ter estimates. We computed accuracies separately for each language in each condition. In addition, for multilingual models, we computed the relative error reduction over the strong monolingual base-line, macro-averaged over languages. 3.5 Training Our implementation used the flat parameteriza-tion described in Section 3.2.2 for both the phy-logenetic and A LL P AIRS models. We originally did this in order to facilitate comparison with the non-phylogenetic A LL P AIRS model, which has no equivalent hierarchical parameterization. In prac-tice, optimizing with the hierarchical parameteri-
All models were trained by directly optimizing the observed data likelihood using L-BFGS (Liu et al., 1989). Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010) suggest that directly optimizing the observed data likeli-hood may offer improvements over the more stan-dard expectation-maximization (EM) optimization procedure for models such as the DMV, espe-cially when the model is parameterized using fea-tures. We stopped training after 200 iterations in all cases. This fixed stopping criterion seemed to be adequate in all experiments, but presumably there is a potential gain to be had in fine tuning. To initialize, we used the harmonic initializer pre-sented in Klein and Manning (2004). This type of initialization is deterministic, and thus we did not perform random restarts.

We found that for all models  X  2 = 0 . 2 gave rea-sonable results, and we used this setting in all ex-periments. For most models, we found that vary-affect accuracy. For some models, the directed ac-curacy was less flat with respect to  X  2 . In these less-stable cases, there seemed to be an interac-tion between the variance and the choice between head conventions. For example, for some settings determiners head noun phrases. In particular, we observed that even when direct accuracy did fluc-tuate, undirected accuracy remained more stable. Table 2 shows the overall results. In all cases, methods which coupled the languages in some way outperformed the independent baselines that considered each language independently. 4.1 Bilingual Models The weakest of the coupled models was F AMI -LIES , which had an average relative error reduc-tion of 5.6% over the strong baseline. In this case, most of the average improvement came from a sin-gle family: Spanish and Portuguese. The limited improvement of the family-level prior compared to other phylogenies suggests that there are impor-tant multilingual interactions that do not happen within families. Table 2 also reports the maximum accuracy achieved for each language when it was paired with another language (same family or oth-erwise) and trained together with a single common parent. These results appear in the column headed by B EST P AIR , and show the best accuracy for the language on that row over all possible pairings with other languages. When pairs of languages were trained together in isolation, the largest bene-fit was seen for languages with small training cor-pora, not necessarily languages with common an-cestry. In our setup, Spanish, Slovene, and Chi-nese have substantially smaller training corpora than the rest of the languages considered. Other-wise, the patterns are not particularly clear; com-bined with subsequent results, it seems that pair-wise constraint is fairly limited. 4.2 Multilingual Models Models that coupled multiple languages per-formed better in general than models that only considered pairs of languages. The G LOBAL model, which couples all languages, if crudely, yielded an average relative error reduction of 9.9%. This improvement comes as the number of languages able to exert mutual constraint in-creases. For example, Dutch and Danish had large improvements, over and above any improvements these two languages gained when trained with a single additional language. Beyond the simplistic G LOBAL phylogeny, the more nuanced L INGUIS -TIC model gave large improvements for English, Swedish, and Portuguese. Indeed, the L INGUIS -TIC model is the only model we evaluated that gave improvements for all the languages we con-sidered.

It is reasonable to worry that the improvements from these multilingual models might be partially due to having more total training data in the mul-tilingual setting. However, we found that halv-ing the amount of data used to train the English, Dutch, and Swedish (the languages with the most training data) monolingual models did not sub-stantially affect their performance, suggesting that for languages with several thousand sentences or more, the increase in statistical support due to ad-ditional monolingual data was not an important ef-fect (the DMV is a relatively low-capacity model in any case). 4.3 Comparison of Phylogenies Recall the structures of the three phylogenies presented in Figure 2. These phylogenies dif-fer in the correlations they can represent. The G
LOBAL phylogeny captures only  X  X niversals, X  while F AMILIES captures only correlations be-tween languages that are known to be similar. The L
INGUISTIC model captures both of these effects simultaneously by using a two layer hierarchy. Notably, the improvement due to the L INGUISTIC model is more than the sum of the improvements due to the G LOBAL and F AMILIES models. 4.4 Phylogenetic vs. A LL P AIRS The phylogeny is capable of allowing appropri-ate influence to pass between languages at mul-tiple levels. We compare these results to the A
LL P AIRS model in order to see whether limi-tation to a tree structure is helpful. The A LL P
AIRS model achieved an average relative error reduction of 17.1%, certainly outperforming both the simple phylogenetic models. However, the rich phylogeny of the L INGUISTIC model, which incorporates linguistic constraints, outperformed the freer A LL P AIRS model. A large portion of this improvement came from English, a language for which the L INGUISTIC model greatly outper-formed all other models evaluated. We found that the improved English analyses produced by the L
INGUISTIC model were more consistent with this model X  X  analyses of other languages. This consis-tency was not present for the English analyses pro-duced by other models. We explore consistency in more detail in Section 5. 4.5 Comparison to Related Work The likelihood models for both the strong mono-lingual baseline and the various multilingual mod-els are the same, both expanding upon the standard DMV by adding coarse S HARED features. These coarse features, even in a monolingual setting, im-proved performance slightly over the weak base-line, perhaps by encouraging consistent treatment of the different finer-grained variants of parts-only difference between the multilingual systems and the strong baseline is whether or not cross-language influence is allowed through the prior.
While this progression of model structure is similar to that explored in Cohen and Smith (2009), Cohen and Smith saw their largest im-provements from tying together parameters for the varieties of coarse parts-of-speech monolinugally, and then only moderate improvements from allow-ing cross-linguistic influence on top of monolin-gual sharing. When Cohen and Smith compared their best shared logistic-normal bilingual mod-els to monolingual counter-parts for the languages they investigate (Chinese and English), they re-ported a relative error reduction of 5.3%. In com-parison, with the L INGUISTIC model, we saw a much larger 16.9% relative error reduction over our strong baseline for these languages. Evaluat-ing our L INGUISTIC model on the same test sets as (Cohen and Smith, 2009), sentences of length 10 or less in section 23 of PTB and sections 271-300 of CTB, we achieved an accuracy of 56.6 for Chinese and 60.3 for English. The best models of Cohen and Smith (2009) achieved accuracies of 52.0 and 62.0 respectively on these same test sets.
Our results indicate that the majority of our model X  X  power beyond that of the standard DMV is derived from multilingual, and in particular, more-than-bilingual, interaction. These are, to the best of our knowledge, the first results of this kind for grammar induction without bitext. By examining the proposed parses we found that the L INGUISTIC and A LL P AIRS models produced analyses that were more consistent across lan-guages than those of the other models. We also observed that the most common errors can be summarized succinctly by looking at attach-ment counts between coarse parts-of-speech. Fig-ure 3 shows matrix representations of dependency counts. The area of a square is proportional to the number of order-collapsed dependencies where the column label is the head and the row label is the argument in the parses from each system. For ease of comprehension, we use the cross-lingual projections and only show counts for selected in-teresting classes.

Comparing Figure 3(c), which shows depen-dency counts proposed by the L INGUISTIC model, to Figure 3(a), which shows the same for the strong monolingual baseline, suggests that the analyses proposed by the L INGUISTIC model are more consistent across languages than are the analyses proposed by the monolingual model. For example, the monolingual learners are divided as to whether determiners or nouns head noun phrases. There is also confusion about which la-bels head whole sentences. Dutch has the problem that verbs modify pronouns more often than pro-nouns modify verbs, and pronouns are predicted to head sentences as often as verbs are. Span-ish has some confusion about conjunctions, hy-pothesizing that verbs often attach to conjunctions, and conjunctions frequently head sentences. More subtly, the monolingual analyses are inconsistent in the way they head prepositional phrases. In the monolingual Portuguese hypotheses, preposi-tions modify nouns more often than nouns mod-ify prepositions. In English, nouns modify prepo-sitions, and prepositions modify verbs. Both the Dutch and Spanish models are ambivalent about the attachment of prepositions.

As has often been observed in other contexts (Liang et al., 2008), promoting agreement can improve accuracy in unsupervised learning. Not only are the analyses proposed by the L INGUISTIC model more consistent, they are also more in ac-cordance with the gold analyses. Under the L IN -GUISTIC model, Dutch now attaches pronouns to verbs, and thus looks more like English, its sister in the phylogenetic tree. The L INGUISTIC model has also chosen consistent analyses for preposi-tional phrases and noun phrases, calling preposi-tions and nouns the heads of each, respectively. The problem of conjunctions heading Spanish sen-tences has also been corrected.
 Figure 3(b) shows dependency counts for the G
LOBAL multilingual model. Unsurprisingly, the analyses proposed under global constraint appear somewhat more consistent than those proposed under no multi-lingual constraint (now three lan-guages agree that prepositional phrases are headed by prepositions), but not as consistent as those pro-posed by the L INGUISTIC model.

Finally, Figure 3(d) shows dependency counts in the hand-labeled dependency parses. It appears that even the very consistent L INGUISTIC parses do not capture the non-determinism of preposi-tional phrase attachment to both nouns and verbs. Even without translated texts, multilingual con-straints expressed in the form of a phylogenetic prior on parameters can give substantial gains in grammar induction accuracy over treating lan-guages in isolation. Additionally, articulated phy-logenies that are sensitive to evolutionary structure can outperform not only limited flatter priors but also unconstrained all-pairs interactions.
