 Jimmy Lin and Chris Dyer University of Maryland, College Park {jimmylin,redpony}@umd.edu This half  X  day tutorial introduces participants to data  X  intensive text processing with the MapReduce programming model [1], using the open  X  source Hadoop implementation. The focus will be on scalability and the tradeoffs associated with distributed processing of large datasets. Content will include general discussions about algorithm design, presentation of illustrative algorithms, case studies in HLT applications, as well as practical advice in writing Hadoop programs and running Hadoop clusters. Amazon has generously agreed to provide each participant with $100 in Amazon Web Services (AWS) credits that can used toward its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)  X  X tility computing X  service (sufficient for 1000 instance  X  hours). EC2 allows anyone to rapidly provision Hadoop clusters  X  X n the fly X  without upfront hardware investments, and provides a low  X  cost vehicle for exploring Hadoop.
 The tutorial is targeted at any NLP researcher interested in data  X  intensive processing and scalability issues in general. No background in parallel or distributed computing is necessary, but a prior knowledge of HLT is assumed.
 The following lists topics that will be covered: Jimmy Lin is an assistant professor in the iSchool at the University of Maryland, College Park. He joined the faculty in 2004 after completing his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. Dr. Lin X  X  research interests lie at the intersection of natural language processing and information retrieval. He leads the University of Maryland X  X  effort in the Google/IBM Academic Cloud Computing Initiative. Dr. Lin has taught two semester  X  long Hadoop courses [2] and has given numerous talks about MapReduce to a wide audience.
 Chris Dyer is a Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park, in the Department of Linguistics. His current research interests include statistical machine translation, machine learning, and the relationship between artificial language processing systems and the human linguistic processing system. He has served on program committees for AMTA, ACL, COLING, EACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ISWLT, and the ACL Workshops on Machine translation, and is one of the developers of the Moses open source machine translation toolkit. He has practical experience solving NLP problems with both the Hadoop MapReduce framework and Google X  X  MapReduce implementation, which was made possible by an internship with Google Research in 2008.
