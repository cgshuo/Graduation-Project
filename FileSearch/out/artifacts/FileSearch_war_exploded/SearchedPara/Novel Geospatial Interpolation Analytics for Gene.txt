 This paper addresses geospatial interpolation for meteorological measurements in which we estimate the values of climatic metrics at unsampled sites with existing observations. Providing clima-tological and meteorological conditions covering a large region is potentially useful in many applications, such as smart grid. How-ever, existing research works on interpolation either cause a large number of complex calculations or are lack of high accuracy. We propose a Bayesian compressed sensing based non-parametric sta-tistical model to efficiently perform the spatial interpolation task. Student-t priors are employed to model the sparsity of unknown signals X  coefficients, and the Approximated Variational Inference (AVI) method is provided for effective and fast learning. The pre-sented model has been deployed at IBM, targeting for aiding the intelligent management of smart grid. The evaluations on two real world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Complete and accurate source of meteorological data are prereq-uisites for the efficient modelling of a wide variety of environmen-tal processes [14]. For example, the productivity for wheat largely depends on the climate patterns, such as precipitation [24]. Crime rates are primarily driven by pleasant weather [13], while cherry blossom is mainly influenced by temperature, sunshine, etc. [20]. However, the most common source of climatic data is meteorologi-cal stations, which only supply measurements in some limited loca-tions. Geospatial interpolation has thus attracted many researchers for the estimation of weather or climate variables at unsampled lo-cations.

This paper looks specifically at the application of spatial inter-polation to smart grid applications. Smart grid refers to a mod-ernized utility electricity delivery systems, where the power dis-tribution and management is enhanced by employing computer-based remote control and automation along with advanced two-way communications and pervasive computing capabilities, targeting for improved control, efficiency, reliability, safety and sustainabil-ity [5, 30]. A smart grid intelligently and bidirectionally delivers electricity between suppliers and consumers, where meteorologi-cal variables play an important role [12]. For example, temperature and precipitation are two climate measurements that have great im-pact on the electricity grid. From the perspective of temperature, we anticipate that when the thermometer rises in summer, so does the demand for power to achieve comfortable temperatures. The increased degree of hotness would also decrease the efficiency of power plants no matter the power is generated from stream, wa-ter, nuclear, natural resources, solar, or wind. At the same time, the increased temperatures might reduce transmission lines X  effi-ciency and lead to line sags, which would potentially disrupt the service [8]. Considering precipitation X  X  impacts, we expect that less precipitation might cause the drop of water level, further reducing the generation of hydro-power plants. Drought situation can pose a serious threat to the transmission lines, especially in the states where there is a fire season, such as California. Due to the lack of precipitation, fires are more like to occur and destroy the brittle infrastructure that transports power. It X  X  of critical importance to know about the climate and weather conditions covering the power grid for intelligent peak-load management and effective measures taken to avoid lines X  impairment. However, it X  X  impossible to in-stall weather sensors all around the transmission lines and power plants. An effective and efficient interpolation method is expected to provide maps of climatological and meteorological conditions for the whole grid.

Motivated by the needs of smart grid on weather data products, we focus on geospatial interpolation for general meteorological measurements, the procedure of estimating unsampled sites X  values with a few observations. Much work has been done on estimating weather or climate variables by spatial interpolation. One branch is to apply physical-deterministic model to simulate the spatial varia-tions in climate metrics by solving a large scale of partial differen-tial equations. Although such models are most accurate, however, it X  X  of high complexity and requires high performance computing, such as the national weather service [21] and the Deep Thunder sys-tem deployed by IBM [27]. To balance the efficiency and accuracy, many researchers proposed a variety of learning based interpola-tion techniques, ranging from inverse distance weighting, splines, regression and Kriging to neural networks and machine learning techniques [23, 17, 1]. These learning based models are easy to set up and can complete interpolation in a more efficient manner. However, they are lack of high accuracy.

The approach we present in this paper builds upon compressed sensing methods and recent work in reconstruction problems [18, 7, 31]. Specifically, the proposed model is learned with few mea-surements in some weather stations and then the meteorological values at all other locations are estimated and evaluated. While the interpolation procedure can be naturally formulated as such a re-construction problem, we know of no previous application of these methods to the geospatial interpolation task. Indeed, the most com-mon application of such algorithm is image reconstruction, which typically has small scale in spatial dimension. The large-scale geospa-tial interpolation task poses a new set of challenges for such meth-ods, and existing approaches alone cannot perform well enough. Instead of applying Laplace priors to model coefficients X  sparsity [26, 15, 3], we propose to use Student-t priors, and show that this im-proves the performance in the meteorological domain. Then, an efficient inference algorithm named Approximated Variational In-ference (AVI) is developed based on Taylor series to deal with the intractability caused by the non-conjugate priors and the approxi-mation algorithm is theoretically justified. Besides, we present a sampling based strategy as an alternative inference method to ex-perimentally show the correctness of AVI. With respect to the task of geospatial interpolation, our model significantly outperforms the traditional methods: Thin Plate Spline (TPS) [23] and Kriging [17]. In summary, the primary contributions of this paper are as follows:
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-tion 2, we introduce the application deployment for the proposed approach, and the background knowledge. The Bayesian Com-pressed Sensing using student-T priors model (BCST) is presented in Section 3, including the introduction of the generative model and the inference algorithms. The effectiveness and efficiency of the model are illustrated with extensive experiments in Section 4. Section 5 presents our conclusions.
The intelligent management of electrical grid largely depends on the weather and climate conditions around the power plants, trans-formers and transmission lines. We focus on the application of smart grid asset management. For example, transformers are es-sential assets for utility companies, and it is impossible to construct a weather station for every transformer due to the large number of transformers. To estimate the electrical age of transformers (which Figure 1: Overview of the deployed system: smarter interpola-tion service provides support for the intelligent management of power grid. is different from calendar age) [2, 28], it is of critical importance to consider the weather conditions as input variables for modeling and computing. Acting as the smarter interpolation service, our system is capable of producing a map of meteorological measurements to potentially support the smart management of electricity grid. As shown in Figure 1, the system is consists of three key modules: The preliminary evaluation results show that the deployed system can provide on-line interpolation service with very short latency. Additionally, by analysing the large amount of historical weather data, our system can discover the seasonal patterns and identify the extreme climatic conditions. An example application to smart grid is to help for wind turbine placement, since the performance and useful life of wind turbines is sensitive to wind direction/velocity, precipitation, humidity, etc. [25]. A visualization module is also developed to visualize the interpolation results. This can help to quickly recognize the places with extreme weathers, which limit the normal functionality of power grid.
A spatial performance of interest, such as temperature, can be expressed as a 2-D function g ( i, j ) , where i, j denote the coordi-nate of a spatial location in the two-dimensional plane. We can discretize the spatial region into equal-sized grids with P rows and Q columns, and then the coordinates i and j are discrete numbers accordingly: i  X  X  1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,P } ,j  X  X  1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,Q }
Formally, the function g ( i, j ) can be projected to the frequency domain by numerous 2-D transforms, such as Discrete Fourier Trans-form (DFT) [19], Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) [11]. Note that DCT is used throughout the paper to illustrate the idea of our pro-posed model, which can be easily generalized to other transforms. Mathematically, the DCT transform can be represented as [11], where G ( u, v ) for u =1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,P , v =1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,Q is the set of DCT coefficients, and While the Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) [11] can be applied to project the DCT coefficients ( G ( u, v ) ) to be the perfor-mance measurements in spatial domain, where  X  ( u, v, i, j ) is defined in Eq. (2).

Compressed Sensing (CS) is an effective approach to recover original signal from few observations [6], which also has been val-idated to be powerful in spatial interpolation [31]: where y  X  R M  X  1 denotes the few observations, z  X  R K  X  1 notes the sparse coefficients,  X   X  R M  X  K is the matrix to trans-form from z to y , and u  X  R M  X  1 represents the noise with zero mean and precision  X  . Let f  X  R K  X  1 denote the unknown signal. Then we know that
Under the conditions that z is sparse, even when the number of measurements in y is far smaller than the number of coefficients in z , i.e., M K , the original signal f can be accurately recon-structed using Eq. (3), where z can be estimated by solving the optimization problem: The l 1  X  regularization formulation in Eq. (6) is equivalent to using a Laplace prior 1 on the coefficients z [3, 15],
With respect to the large-scale geospatial interpolation task, we suspect the effectiveness of Lapalce prior in Eq. (7) for modelling the distributions of the sparse coefficients. From the visualization of the coefficients X  histograms in Figure 2, we observe that the La-palce prior over-penalizes the true coefficients. Student-t is thus se-lected to compare with Laplace, since Student-t X  X  heavy tail prop-erty enables it to better model large coefficients, while the peak near zero helps to keep z to be sparse. To explore the suitable reg-ularizations on z , Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) test is performed with two real-world meteorological datasets: KNMI dataset [16] and a dataset provided by the vendor of IBM (Vendor dataset). Let z =[ z 1 ,z 2 ,  X  X  X  ,z K ] T , LLR is formulated as where Student-t distribution X  X  parameters (  X  : location parameter,  X  : scale parameter,  X  : degree of freedoms) and Laplace distribu-tion X  X  parameters (  X  : location parameter, b : scale parameter) are re-spectively estimated by maximizing corresponding likelihood func-tions. Table 1 shows the parameters of these two distributions and the LLR values of Student-t over Laplace. The LLR values are far greater than 0, indicating that Student-t is a better fit than Laplace. Figure 2 also illustrates similar conclusions, where we respectively use Laplace and Student-t distributions to fit the histograms of 1000 samples X  Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. It figures out that Student-t can better fit the histograms for all of the mete-orological measurements. This motivates us to extend compressed sensing by applying Student-t priors to model the sparsity of the coefficients.
Using Maximum a Posterior (MAP) with Eq. (10) and (7), Eq. (6) can be achieved with  X  =  X /b . calculated from 100 samples for both dataset.

The geospatial interpolation of large-scale meteorological mea-surements has become a critical challenge since the prior of co-efficients can not be captured with Laplace distribution. This sec-tion introduces a novel geospatial interpolation method by applying Student-t to model coefficient X  X  distribution, and corresponding in-ference and learning algorithms are provided.
We begin our treatment of the generative model by expressing it as a directed graph, as illustrated in Figure 3. The measurement noise u is Gaussian with zero mean and unknown precision  X  . With Eq. (4), we know that for each sample y i , it depends on the latent variables z and  X  The M measurements are independent with each other given all the latent variables
The prior on the precision  X  of noise follows a Gamma distri-bution governed by hyper-parameters  X  0 (shape parameter) and  X  (rate parameter)
The prior on the coefficients z is given by a Student-t distri-bution governed by hyper-parameters  X  0 (mean value),  X  Figure 3: Representation of the generative model as a directed acyclic graph. The observed variable y i is shown by the shaded node, while the latent variables z j and  X  are shown by circles. The right box represents the M independent measurements, while the left box represents the K independent DCT coeffi-(degree of freedom) and  X  2 0 &gt; 0 (scale parameter) The K sparse coefficients are independent with each other
Armed with the probabilistic formulation of BCST, the predic-tive density can be obtained by marginalizing over the latent vari-ables (parameters become latent variables after applying prior dis-tributions on them), so that where  X  = { z , X  } denotes the latent variables. To implement this framework, we must address the formulation of a tractable proce-dure for marginalization over the posterior distribution. Since the exact computation will inevitably cause high computational cost, approximation is required. Starting from Eq. (10), the evidence (marginal likelihood) of BCST is obtained by averaging the likelihood under priors for the latent variables (parameters which have their own hyper-parameters) Since the exact inference is intractable, we need to resort to some form of approximation. Let q be any functional form of  X  satisfying q (  X  ) d  X  =1 and q (  X  ) &gt; 0 . By Jensen X  X  inequality, we have where F ( q ) forms a lower bound of ln P ( y ) . The significance of this approximation is that the lower bound might be tractable by se-lecting suitable q (  X  ) although the original marginal log likelihood is not. Note that maximizing F ( q ) is equivalent to minimizing the KL-divergence between q (  X  ) and P (  X  | y ) [4].

Without the loss of generality, let q j = q ( z j ) for j =1 , 2 , and let q K +1 = q (  X  ) . Similar to [4], we consider to restrict the family of distributions q (  X  ) by factorizing the functional form The form to maximize F ( q ) with respect to q k is given by where E j = k [ P ( y ,  X  )] is the expectation of P ( y , the q distributions over all variables  X  j for j = k . Then the optimal q is We can easily observe that q k will have the same functional forms with its priors for conjugate models. However, Student-t priors are not conjugate, which leads to an analytical intractable model and infeasible for learning. Note that the Laplace priors on Eq. (7)) are also not conjugate, two and three stage hierarchical pri-ors are respectively considered for approximating Laplace in [15] and [3]. Instead, we consider a much faster and more effective way for the approximation of Student-t: To deal with the intractability, under the condition that Algorithm 1 Geospatial Interpolation with BCST-AVI Input: M geospatial locations { ( i 1 ,j 1 ) ,  X  X  X  , ( i M observations y  X  R M  X  1 at these locations.

(19), the optimal q (  X  ) can be easily achieved since it X  X  in conjugate form where  X  The expected values in the above formulas are given by Then the optimal q k can be achieved by iteratively updating the variational parameters  X  N , X  N , X  N (see Eq. (22)) and  X  Eq. (25)) until convergence. The theoretical analysis of AVI is shown in Section A.1.

Evaluation of Predictive Density: Based on Jensen X  X  inequal-ity, we consider to evaluate the lower bound of the predictive den-sity where E  X  [ln  X  ] is the negative entropy of q (  X  ) , and fined in Eq. (26). The approximation in Line 1 of Eq. (27) is due to using variational distributions to replace the exact posterior distri-bution. The inequality in Line 2 is a simple Jensen bound.
The procedure to use BCST-AVI (Bayesian Compressed Sens-ing using the Approximated Variational Inference) for geospatial interpolation is summarized in Algorithm 1.
Alternatively, we use sampling method to approximate the pos-terior distributions P (  X  | y ) as a benchmark for testing the cor-rectness of AVI. Gibbs sampling on P (  X  | y ) can be performed by flipping the latent variables: P ( z j | y , z \ z j , X  ) might be non log-concave, we apply Adap-tive Rejection Metropolis Sampling (ARMS) for the generation of z [10]. Then the predictive density is evaluated by where T is the number of total generated samples, and b is the number of abandoned starting samples, targeting for reducing the effects of unreasonable initializations.
In this section, we perform the geospatial interpolation task to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model compared to the baselines.

We use 2 general meteorological data sets which are summarized in Table 2. KNMI is available online [16], which contains about 12 years (2001/05  X  2013/05) climate data for 33 weather stations spreading throughout Netherlands. We use 11  X  17 grid to split Netherlands into equal-sized cells (edge length of one cell is about 25KM and the 33 stations can be fully separated), and consider one daily snapshot as a sample. The other dataset is provided by the vendor of IBM (Vendor dataset), reporting the climate records of 14,290 weather stations in North United States for almost 3 years (2009/04  X  2012/03). Since the entire North United States is too large for one sample, we consider a 20  X  20 equal-sized grid as a sample for this dataset, where edge length of each cell is about 10KM.

We compare the proposed models BCST-AVI (Bayesian Com-pressed Sensing using student-T priors with Approximated Vari-ational Inference), BCST-GS (Bayesian Compressed Sensing us-ing student-T priors with Sampling based inference) with BCSL (Bayesian Compressed Sensing using Laplace prior), CS (Com-pressed Sensing), TPS (Thin Plate Spline), and UK (Universal Krig-ing). The BCSL is implemented based on the package VB-BCS, where the Laplace prior is modelled in a hierarchical way [15]. The CS is extended to perform geospatial interpolation and imple-mented based on Virtual Probe (VP) solver [31]. TPS is imple-mented with R package  X  X ields X  [9], while UK is implemented with R package  X  X iceKriging X  [22]. All tests run on an Intel i7-2760QM processor using up to eight cores (2.40 GHz).

Average Normalized Error (ANE) is used to measure the inter-polation performance, i.e., where g ( i, j ) is the observed values at the evaluation weather sta-tions, and  X  g ( i, j ) is the estimated value. Geospatial Interpolation Results on KNMI: With respect to KNMI, 33 weather stations almost uniformly locate in a spatial re-gion split with a 17  X  11 equal-sized grid. To evaluate the perfor-mance of models with different M , we vary the number of mea-surements from 6 to 16 (about from 20% to 50% of 33 weather stations), and the residual sites are used for computing the ANE values. For a certain M , we repeat for 100 runs. Table 3 shows the mean  X  std (standard derivation) of ANE values for all models.
Geospatial Interpolation Results on Vendor Dataset: In terms of Vendor dataset, there are about 170 weather stations in a grid of size 20  X  20 equal-sized cells. We vary the number of measure-ments from 20 to 120 (about from 10% to 70% of 170 weather sta-tions) to show how performance of models changes with M , while the remaining stations are used for evaluations. Similarly, 100 runs are repeated for any certain M . As shown in Table 4, three rows of mean  X  std of ANE values are reported for any M : the first row is for metric Temperature, the second is for Humidity, while the last row is for Barometric Pressure.

As shown in Tables 3 and 4, regardless of the datasets and met-rics, the proposed two models (BCST-AVI and BCST-GS) signif-icantly outperform TPS and UK, and are competitive with BCSL and CS. Specifically, under most cases, both BCST-AVI and BCST-GS perform better than BCSL and CS, indicating that the Student-t priors can more accurately model the sparsity of climate data X  X  co-efficients. We also observe that the performance of BCST-AVI, BCST-GS, BCSL and CS slightly increases with the growth of M while that of TPS and UK significantly increase, and the best per-formance of TPS and UK is chasing the worst of other four methods for many cases; thus conclude that the compressed sensing based methods can achieve good performance with much fewer measure-ments than TPS and UK. The similar performance of BCST-AVI and BCST-GS validates that the Approximated Variational Infer-ence (AVI) can achieve as good approximation as Gibbs sampling based inference. We study the behaviour of BCST-AVI, BCST-GS, CS, TPS and UK in terms of running time. Considering the worst case for time consumption, M is set to be 16 for KNMI, and 120 for Vendor dataset. Since the varying metrics (i.e., temperature, humidity and barometric pressure) lead to very small change in the time con-sumption, we do not distinct them here. 10 runs are repeated to report the mean  X  std of the time consumption in millisecond (ms). As shown in Table 5, BCST-AVI consumes much less time than all other methods for both datasets, CS, TPS and UK can achieve ac-ceptable performance and perform better than BCSL. As expected, BCST-GS costs quite more time than the others. Generally, increas-ing M (from KNMI X  X  16 to Vendor X  X  120) will inevitably cause more time consumption.

Our system provides a function to visualize the geospatial inter-polation results with a high resolution in a large spatial scale: using Vendor data, we are capable of estimating the meteorological mea-surements in a 10 KM  X  10 KM resolution throughout USA. This allows decision makers to quickly identify the bottlenecks which limit the functionality of power grid. The detailed visualization process is implemented in a recursive way. Suppose the task is to interpolate and visualize the climate variables for USA. Since it X  X  neither efficient nor accurate to perform interpolation with respect grid the region until the edge-length of each cell is approximately 10KM. Then we select a size of P  X  Q adjacent cells as a sub-region and the size of sub-regions can vary to adapt to real scenarios. The sub-regions may also overlap with each other to reduce the edge effects. Moreover, for each sub-region, BSC-AVI is applied to per-form interpolation, and this process can be concurrently executed. Finally, sub-regions X  interpolation results are combined to produce the result for the whole region. Using the above stated procedure, the interpolated results would cover the sea or large water area, where the values are estimated based on the observations of sen-sors on land. Due to the inherent different properties of land and sea in determining climate conditions, this would inevitably lead to the inaccurate estimations for the sea area. We thus can ignore the results on the sea area in the following figures 2 . We respectively Figure 4: Example geospatial interpolation results: tempera-ture map in USA.
 Figure 5: Example geospatial interpolation results: humidity map in USA. show example interpolation results of temperature (in Kelvin), hu-midity (in %, i.e., relative humidity), barometric pressure (in 1/100 inch of mercury) in Figure 4, 5, and 6. The observations collected from nation-wide weather stations are used for interpolations. It is easy to identify the hot areas in USA (i.e., the areas with high temperature ) from Figure 4. As illustrated in 5, the dry areas (i.e.,
Since we don X  X  have land boundary data, it X  X  impossible to remove the estimations for sea area in the visualization process. Figure 6: Example geospatial interpolation results: barometric pressure map in USA. the areas with low humidity) have covered most of the deserts. It is expected that the barometric pressure changes very slowly with spatial locations as shown in Figure 6. The example interpolation results in New York City for temperature, humidity and barometric Figure 7: Example geospatial interpolation results: tempera-ture map in New York City. Figure 8: Example geospatial interpolation results: humidity map in New York City.
 Figure 9: Example geospatial interpolation results: barometric pressure map in New York City. pressure are respectively shown in Figure 7, 8 and 9. The city level maps of meteorological measurements convey more detailed infor-mation, which can be potentially used for city planning and guiding users to find places with pleasant weathers.
In this paper, we propose a new method to perform geospatial interpolation for large-scale meteorological measurements. Specif-ically, Student-t prior is incorporated into a Bayesian compressed sensing model to capture the distributions of coefficients, and the corresponding fast inference algorithm is provided. Using two real world datasets, we show that the proposed models are capable of effectively and efficiently estimating the values at unknown places with only a few measurements, while significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, our deployed sys-tem is of critical importance in supporting the intelligent manage-ment of electrical grid by providing the ambient climate conditions of power plants, transformers and transmission lines in high spa-tiotemporal resolutions.
