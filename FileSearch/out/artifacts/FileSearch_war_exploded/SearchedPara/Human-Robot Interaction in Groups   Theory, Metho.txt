 For the last decade, robots have been adopted into group work ranging from corporate offices to military operations. While robotic technology has matured enough to allow robots to act as team members, our understanding of how this alters group work is limited. In particular, little work has examined how the adoption of robots might alter group processes and outcomes. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers investigating issues related to the theoretic al frameworks and methodological approaches to studying human r obot interactions within groups. We expect the workshop will contribute to our understanding of how to better design robots for group interactions. H.5.0 Information Interfaces and Presentation (e.g., HCI): General Design, Human Factors, Theory human-robot interaction, groups, teams, co mputer-supported cooperative work Organizations are increasingly rely ing on the use of work groups [3-5, 12, 16, 17]. Communicati on and information technologies have changed the way groups operate [1, 15, 20, 21]. The explosion of robot adoption in groups for the last decade has been reshaping how groups work in pract ice. As other technologies did, robots in groups can evoke new socio-technical issues between workers and technology. These issues are likely to have major implications for group processes and outcomes [7, 11, 19]. Yet, little is known about this emerging area of study. Robots have been adopted in many contexts and domains of group work. For example, telepresen ce robots enable geographically dispersed teams to communicate mo re effectively [23]. By using robots to represent dispersed group members, these members can have a greater sense of social presence during group discussions, which facilitates social interactions between members in different locations [15]. Furthermore, some scholars believe that the use of robots to represent dispersed te am members will only increase [24]. In addition, government and private businesses have adopted robots as group members [8, 25]. Extreme work groups, such as SWAT teams, use multiple robots in tactical field operations [7]. Construction companies have star ted to utilize autonomous robots for dangerous construction tasks to avoid loss of human life [25, 26]. Robots are also being used for non-task-related activities. Service robots such as Snac kbots provide refreshments to employees throughout the work day [10, 13]. Human  X  robot interactions can also lead individuals to develop strong emotional attachments to robot s. Evidence of this is often seen when individuals put clothes and accessories on their robots, treating them as if they were hu man [10]. Furthermore, research has shown that these emotional attachments can elicit in-group behaviors by which humans feel that the robot belongs to them or their group rather than the whole organization [19]. The inclusion of robots as team members can lead to new insights about how groups work, which we believe is fundamentally different from what we know of all-human groups. For example, how does the inclusion of robots he lp or hurt team coordination or cooperation? Does the inclusion of robots facilitate or impede the development of team trust? De spite these new and interesting questions, we know ve ry little about this area [14, 22, 24]. This workshop is designed to stimulate interest in human  X  robot interactions within groups by assembling researchers who share a common interest in this area. Anot her goal is to promote the use of a diverse set of theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches to studying human  X  robot interactions within groups. We also expect that the workshop will inform design by providing insights into how the design of robots can facilitate or hinder group interactions. As such, the goals of this workshop are as follows:  X  To bring together and establish a community of  X  To present and discuss theoretical frameworks that  X  To brainstorm and develop reliable and valid  X  To identify and form sugges tions and implications for To achieve the workshop goals st ated above, we suggest some potential themes that should allow a variety of perspectives to emerge.

However, the workshop is loosely structured so that the following arrangement can be spontaneously run on the day of workshop. The workshop will begin with intr oductions to the topics by the organizers followed by a presentation of the day X  X  agenda. Participants will each give a short presentation (10  X  15 minutes) on their paper. Participants are encouraged to provide demonstrations of human  X  robot interactions within groups by using actual robots, video and/ or other materials. After all presentations, participants will engage in a discussion about the papers presented. Although there will be preplanned discussion topics there will be time set aside for emergent topics that come out of workshop discussions. The afternoon session will be filled with small-group discussions. The small groups will be form ed based on the final themes derived from the workshop discu ssions in the morning session. Based on the number of participants and themes, the participants will be divided into 3  X  4 groups. Each group will be encouraged to produce a slide show summarizing the outcome of their discussions. In the final session, the slides will be shared and discussed with all participants. The workshop will be concluded with a reflective discussion followed up with a summarization of the insights that emerged during the workshop. Participants will also be encouraged to provide feedback about the workshop and provide any future suggestions for other workshop participants. Potential participants should s ubmit a two-page position paper to the organizer before the workshop. Authors can refer to the suggested workshop themes but are encouraged to bring up new perspectives that our themes do not cover. Along with the position paper, authors should also bring a 10-to 15-minute slide presentation. Please use the ACM standard format for submissions. Audio/visual equipmen t is highly encouraged but not required. The maximum number of participants is 15 but is subject to change based on the number of workshop submissions. Dr. Lionel P.
