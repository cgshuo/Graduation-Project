 Keyw ords . Text reuse, information o w, statistical translation. Ov erview . Man y kinds of documents involv e reuse of pre viously published material. For example, typical newspaper articles com-bine new information with recapitulation of pertinent background.
Given a text snippet, passage, or even entire document, it is use-ful to be able to determine the source of the information in the passage. More specically , the task is to seek, on a sentence-by-sentence basis, other instances of the same information. Since the emphasis is on factual information, this task is related to some as-pects of question answering, but where the  X queries X  are the orig-inal sentences and the  X answers X  are transformations of those sen-tences. Our trust in a piece of factual information is inuenced by the diversity of sources where we disco ver the fact.

If, howe ver, all references to some information are deri ved from the same source, then our trust in the information is diminished.
Source identication can also be seen as a form of plagiarism detection. Ho we ver, it is repetition of elements such as sentences (not whole documents) that is of interest in this task. In informa-tion collections such as newswires, concise statements of fact are often repeated verbatim. For example, consider the description of the eruption of Mt St. Helens as  X the May 18, 1980 eruption that leveled 230 square miles, left 57 people dead or missing and sent up an ash cloud that circled the globe X . While the indi vidual ele-ments of this statement  X  the date, the area affected, the number of deaths, the fact of the ash cloud  X  could come from a wide range of sources, when the whole is repeated it is lik ely that one is the source of the other , or that some third article has been used as a source by both.
 The R ECAP system . We have developed sentence-and document-level similarity measures for the task of nding similar information, with the intention of embedding several novel properties. In partic-ular , we seek to: A R ECAP user enters a block of text and is sho wn summaries of matches, strength-of-match indicators, and a timeline sho wing when the matches occurred, as sho wn abo ve. The latter is possible be-cause most newswire data is annotated by date of publication. When a match is selected, matching sentences are highlighted, allo wing rapid bro wsing of potential sources. The timeline is of particular value for the intended task; for example, it often reveals that infor -mation has been re-used by the newswire over several years.
Our prototype R ECAP system pro vides a persuasi ve demonstra-tion that source-nding is useful. The search model is, for this task, considerably more informati ve than the list-of-answers that is stan-dard for search engines, and as our demonstration sho ws, is simple and intuiti ve. With a range of potential specialist applications, our softw are introduces a valid new form of search.
