This indication is reinforced by the author X  X  constant use historical anecdotes, some dating from World War I. These vign-ettes show how Dr. Libicki attempts to map linear military goals and objectives to the asymmetric, global cyber environ-ment. Perhaps because of this approach, the book never attempts to look at any new modes of conducting a cyberspace campaign or any trends that might indicate growing threats.

While  X  X  X onquest in Cyberspace X  succeeds in making an argument for the application of soft power or friendly conquest, its lack of current material and new insights hinder its usefulness in understanding the strategic potential and limitations of information war in cyberspace. As a result, I would not recommend this book for strategic information systems or informa-tion operations planners.

Ethnography for Marketers: A Guide to Consumer Immersion, Hy Mariampolski, Sage Publications (2006). $43.95, ISBN: 0-7619-6947-0
The field of marketing research is of great importance to the development of companies. It is characterized by a concen-tration on the understanding of consumers X  behaviors and preference and aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns. Both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies are adopted in this field.

This book, Ethnography for Marketers, is intended to be a handbook introducing the methodology of ethnography, a meth-od of qualitative research, to marketing practitioners, marketing researchers, students, behavior scientists, and other researchers who are interested in studying the interaction between consumers and products.

This book comprising 26 chapters is divided into two parts. The first part addresses the background, concepts and overall orientation of an ethnography study in marketing research. The second part addresses details of conducting an ethnography study on site visits and how to report the results of the study.

The first part of the book has 10 chapters covering two major themes, namely why ethnography is suitable for marketing research and how to manage an ethnography marketing project in general. The author explored issues such as the  X  X ower of ethnography X  in marketing research by identifying the unique advantages of ethnography over traditional qualitative and survey research practice. The authors did not pay much of attention or give much detailed information about ethnography, but rather they emphasized the fact that ethnography could help marketers gain deep insights into consumers X  behavior and preferences by taking into consideration the influences of culture, context and languages. The author enumerated a few examples of the new marketing ethnography, which make the advantages of ethnography in discovering consumers X  behav-ior more convincing. As a result, the readers formulated a concrete profile about the reasons why choosing ethnography, a time consuming and high cost methodology. The author also noticed that ethnography is not always the right tool. So before the author proceeded to introduce the details of conducting ethnography marketing study, he recommended that whether ethnography is appropriate or not for the project should be determined, and several criterions have been provided. However, the author failed to distinguish between ethnography and case study because the criterions the author advocated could be met by both ethnography and case study. The author gave an overview of the implementation of an ethnography project, from client brief, scheduling, participant recruiting, and orientation to logistics in the field.

The second part of the book consists of 16 chapters covering the themes of conducting site visits, data collection and anal-ysis and reporting. Site visit is the most important stage of an ethnography study since it is a stage where researchers spend most of the time (2 X 6 weeks). Compared to traditional  X  X iving with the tribe X  ethnography studies, issues encountered by ethnography marketers are similar. The issues include gaining access to the locations, respecting the right and privacy of participants, cultivating rapport with participants, observing fairly and dispassionately, etc. The author divided the process of site visit into five stages. They are the introductory stage, role-taking and rapport-building stage, general question stage, specific questions and activities stage and closing stage. Of these five stages, the author paid special attention to developing rapport with respondents, motivating respondents and asking questions which are complementary data collecting methods besides observing. Of particularly interesting with regard to developing rapport and motivating respondents is that the author recommended that  X  X esearchers should never rely on the fee to encourage openness X . The author suggested that there are many other reasons that make respondents willing to participate, for example seeking new experience, and recognition etc. As to data collection, the author suggested that during site visit, researchers should play the role of a na X ve outsider and expand the understanding of respondents by probing and interpreting body language. Finally in the data analysis and report-ing part the author recommended and compared five popular qualitative data analysis software and emphasized the impor-tance of interpreting the data. However, compared to the large portion of the book on how to design and implement an ethnography marketing project, too few have been devoted to the data interpretation part which is the most important part for decision making. This book should have considered providing more information on how to interpreting data with some examples.

This book, written by a leading marketing ethnography researcher, presents a comprehensive and structured introduction of conducing ethnography projects, from project design, participants recruiting to the final stage of data reporting and qual-ity review. One of the advantages of this book is that it reads easily and enjoyably for readers even having no prior knowl-edge about ethnography. Understanding consumers X  behavior and preference is especially important in the ever competitive market. The various dos and don X  X s provide practitioners and researchers a useful guideline. However, although being very useful, some shortcomings about ethnography should have been mentioned in this book. Only by understanding both the advantages and disadvantages of ethnography can readers make a right decision as to whether this methodology should be adopted or not.

In sum, this book is a pleasure to read. A coherent and structured presentation of the practices of an ethnography mar-keting research is presented. The vast amount of real world examples cited in this book make it especially easy for readers to follow and understand. This book fulfill its intended purpose of introducing and promoting the use of ethnography in mar-keting research, and thus It is suitable for both beginners and experienced practitioners of this field.

Creating Agile Business Systems with Reusable Knowledge, Amit Mitra, Amar Gupta. Cambridge University Press (2007). $110, Hardback, ISBN: 13 978-0-521-85163-3
This second edition of Mitra and Gupta X  X  book builds upon the ideas developed in the first edition that an agile business model should be based on the knowledge and rules used by a firm. The book lays the foundation of a new computing par-adigm in which computers manipulate meanings, not program code nor blind symbols and establishes a framework for the transfer and use of business knowledge in different contexts. It also describes the business intelligence, in components form, that technical standards must support. The book is co-authored by two prominent figures in the management and informa-tion technology (IT) field. Amit Mitra is Managing Consultant at Headstrong LLC, while Amar Gupta is professor of Entrepre-neurship and MIS at the University of Arizona, Tucson.

The 383 page book is organized into four chapters including  X  X  X n the nature of reality and the nature of business X  (Chapter 1),  X  X  X he object at the root of it all X  (Chapter 2),  X  X  X he nature of attributes X  (Chapter 3),  X  X  X omains and their expression X  (Chap-ter 4). These chapters are preceded by an introduction that provides readers with information about the scope, the structure and the audience of the book. Chapter 1 defines the structure of knowledge and its reuse in diverse scopes. Chapter 2 de-scribes how the object paradigm can encapsulate knowledge and automate its propagation through mechanisms such as inheritance, and how this is the basis for sharing and reusing knowledge in component form. Chapter 3 introduces config-urations and patterns that define constraints on business and object behaviors. Chapter 4 is probably the most important of the book if one refers to its length (almost half of the book length). This chapter develops and describes the concepts of pat-tern, measurability, and emphasizes the meaning of immeasurability. It addresses the spectrum of meanings that range from those that precisely quantify and measure numerically versus those that are purely qualitative.

The development of information and communication technology and especially the Internet, has brought about radical change in the business environment. New channels of supply and distribution of products are emerging. New electronic market-places and exchanges are being created. The infrastructures of firms and the industries within which they operate are constantly altered. Mitra and Gupta X  X  book seeks to address some of the challenges faced by business in the current infor-
