 As Microblog services such as Twitter have b e-come increasingly popular, it is critical to re -consider the applicability of the existing NLP technologies on this new media s ources. Take summarization for example, a Microblog user usually has to browse through tens or even hu n-dreds of posts together with their responses da i ly, therefore it can be beneficial if there is an intell i-gent tool assisting summarizing those info r matio n. 
A utomatic text summarization (ATS) has been inv estigated for over fifty years , but t he majority of the existing techniques might not be appropriate for Microblog write -ups. For instance, a popular kind of approaches for summarization tries to ide n-tify a subset of information, usually in se n tence form, from longer pieces of writings as summary ( Das and Martins , 2007). Such extra c tion -based This paper introduces a framework that summari z-es a post wit h its responses. Motivated by the a b-ovementioned characteristics of Microblog s , we plan to use a two -phase summarization scheme to develop different summarization strategies for di f-ferent type of posts (see Figure 1). I n the first phase, a post will be aut omatically classified into several categories including interrogation, discu s-sion, sharing and chat based on the intention of the users. I n the second phase, the system chooses di f-ferent summarization components for different types of posts . 
T he novelt ies of this system are listed below . 1. Strategically, we propose an underlying 2 -phase 2. Tactically, we argue that it is possible to int e-3. Our work provides an alternative thinking about Below we discuss our two -phase summarization framework and the experiment results on each i n-dividual component. Note that our experiment s were test ed on the Plurk dataset , which is one of the most popular micro -blogging platforms in Asia .
Our observation is that Microblog posts can have different purposes . W e divide them into four categ o ries , Interrogation , Sharing , Discussion , and Chat . 
The I nterrogation posts are questions asked in public with the hope to obtain some useful answers from friends or other users . H owever, it is very common that some r epliers do not provide me a-ningful answers. The responses might serve the purpose for clarif ication or, even worse, have not h-ing to do with the question . H ence we believe the most appropriate summar ization process for this framework . W hen an input post with responses come s in, the system first determines its inten t ion, based on which the system adopts proper strat e gies for summarization. Below we discuss the technical pa rts of each sub -system with exper i ment results. 2.1 Post I nten t ion Classification T his stage aims to classify each post into four ca t-egories , Interrogation , Sharing , Discussion , and Chat . One tricky issue is that the Discussion labe l is essentially a combinati on of interrogation and sharing labels . Therefore, simply treat ing it as an independent label and use a typical mult i -label learning method can hurt the performance . We o b-tain 76.7% (10 -fold cross validation) in accuracy by training a four -class classifier using the 6 -gram character language model. To improve the perfo r-mance , we design a decision -tree based framework that utilizes both manually -designed rules and di s-criminant classification engine (see F igure 2). The system first checks whether the posts co ntain s URLs or pointers to files, then use s a binary cla s-sifier to determine whether the post is interro g ative . 
F or the experiment, we manually annotate 6000 posts consisting of 1840 interrogation , 2002 s ha r-ing , 1905 chat , and 254 d iscussion posts. We tra in a 6 -gram language model as the binary interrog a-tion classifier . T hen we integrate the classifier into our system and test on 6000 posts to obtain a tes t-ing accuracy of 82 . 8 % , which is significantly be t-ter than 76.7% with multi -class class i fication. 2.2 Opin ion Analysis Opinion analysis is used to evaluate public pref e-rence on the shared subject . The system classif ies responses into 3 categories, positive, neg a tive, and neutral .
 sages.

Looking at the content of micro -blogs, we o b-serve that related responses are usually a d jacent to each other as users tend to close ly follow whether their messages are responded and reply to the re s-ponse s from others quickly . Therefore besides co n-tent features, we decide to add the temporal and ordering features (See Table 1 ) to train a classifier that takes a pair o f messages as inpu ts and return whether they are related . By identifying the r e-sponse pairs, our summariz a tion system is able to group the responses into different topic clusters and display the clusters separately. We believe such functionality can assist users to digest l ong Microblog discu s sions.
 F or experiment, the model is trained using LIBSVM ( Chang and Lin , 2001) (RBF kernel) with 6000 response pairs, half of the training set positive and half negative. The positive data can be obtained automatically based on Plurk X  X  built in annotation feature . Responses with @user_name string in the content are matched with earlier re s-ponses by the author, user_name. Based on the learned weights of the features, we observe that content feature is not very useful in determining the r esponse pairs . In a Microblog dialogue, re s-pondents usually do not repeat the question nor duplicate the ke y words. We also have noticed that there is high correlation between the responses r e-latedness and the number of other responses b e-tween them. For exa mple , users are less likely to respond to a response if there have been many re p-lies about this response already. Statistical anal y-sis on positive training data shows that the average number of responses between related re s ponses is 2.3. 
We train the cl assifier using 6000 automatica l ly -extracted pairs of both positive and negative i n-stances. We manually annotated 1600 pairs of data for testing. The experiment result reaches 80.52% accuracy in identifying response pairs. The bas e-line model which uses only content similarity fe a-ture reaches only 45% in acc u racy. 2.4 Resp onse Relevance Detection F or interrogative posts, we think the best summary is to find out the relevent responses as potential answers. component for the problem. Similar to previous components, we exploit a supervised learning a p-search e n gine (see Figure 3) . G iven a query term , our system first return s several posts contai n ing the query string under the search bar. When one of the posts is selected, it will generate a summary a c-c ording to the detected intention and show it in a pop -up frame . We have record ed a video demo n-strating our system. The video can be viewed at http://imss -acl11 -demo.co.cc/ .

For interrogative posts, we perform the r e sponse relevan cy detection. The summary contains the question and relevant answers . Figure 4 is an e x-ample of summary of an interrogative post. We can see that responses other than the first and the last response s are filtered because they are less relevant to the que s tion .
 parts . A pie chart that states the percentage of each opinion group is displaye d . Then the system picks three responses from the majority group or one r e-sponse from each group if there is no significant difference. Figure 5 is an example that most friends of the user dfrag give positive feedback to the shared video link .

For discussi on posts, we combine the response relevan cy detection subsystem and the opinion analysis sub -system for summarization . The fo r mer first eliminates the responses that are not lik e ly to be the answer of the post. The latter then generates a summary for the p ost and relevant re s ponses . The result is similar to sha r ing posts.

For chat posts, we apply the response pair ide n-tification component to generate the su m mary. In the example, F igure 6 , the original Plurk post is about one topic while the responses d i verg e to one We have not seen many researches focusing on the issues of Microblog summarization . W e found o n-ly one work that discusses about the issues of summarization for Microblogs ( Sharifi et al. , 2010 ). Their goal, however, is very diffe r ent from ours as they try to summarize multiple posts and d o not consider the re sponses . T hey propose the Phrase Reinforcement Algorithm to find the most co m-monly used phrase that encompasses the topic phrase , and use these phrases to compose the summary. They are esse n tially trying to solve a multi -document summarization pro b lem while our problem is more similar to short dialog summariz a-tion because the dialogue natur e of Microblogs is one of the most challen g ing part that we tried to overcome. 
In dialog ue summarization, many researchers have point ed out the importance of detect ing r e-sponse pairs in a conversation. Zechner (2001) pe r-forms an in depth analysis and evaluation in the area of open domain spoken d ialogue summariz a-tion. H e uses decision tree cla s sifier with lexical features like POS tags to identify que s tions and applies heuristic rules like maximum distance b e-tween speakers to extract answers. Shrestha and McKeown (200 4) propose a supe r vised learni ng method to detect question -answer pair s in Email conversations. Zhou and Hovy (2005) conce n-trates on summarizing dialogue -style technical i n-ternet relay chats us ing supervised learning methods. Zhou further cluster s chat logs into se v-eral topics and the n extract some essential r e sponse pair s to form summaries . Liu et al. (2006) propose to identify question paragraph via analy z ing each participant  X  s status, and then use cosine measure to select answer paragraphs for online news dataset. 
T he major differe nce s between our comp o nents and the systems proposed by others lie in the sele c-tion of features. D ue to the intrinsic difference b e-tween the writing styles of Microblog and other online sources, our experiments show that the co n-tent feature is not as usefu l as the position and temporal features. In terms of length and writing styles , Microblog s possess very different characteristic s than other o n line information sources such as web blog s and news articles . It is therefore not surprising that di f-
