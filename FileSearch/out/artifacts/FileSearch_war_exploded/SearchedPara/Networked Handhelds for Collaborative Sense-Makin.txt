 Classroom networks of handheld devices have the potential to support a new genre of collaborative learning activities, enabling complex small group tasks that encourage and support the simultaneous engagement of all st udents. At the same time, one-to-one personal computing with intuitive touchscreen interfaces offers engaging simulations and vi sualization aids to individual learners. However, it is not well understood how to design effective simulations to be used by and to engage groups of students in a collaborative setting. My dissertation work is an exploration of the collaborative physics activity design space opened up by networked handheld devices. Specifically, I study the design of networked simulati ons with the aim of engaging students in high-level discourse about physics concepts. K.3.1 [ Computer Uses in Education ]: Collaborative learning Small group collaboration; simu lations; physics education; handhelds; mechanical waves A reform movement within univers ity physics has tasked course developers with designing enga ging collaborative activities [1]. My dissertation research involves an exploration of the activity design space opened up by networked handheld devices. This work is located relative to two distinct axes of prior research and activity design. Research in collaborative learning indicates that tasks are likely to be most effective when they are sufficiently open-ended and complex to necessitate contributions from each member [2], and when participants engage the task and one another in ways that sustain that variety of contributions [3]. Along this line of work, networked handhelds can facilitate greater communication, coordination and negotiation among peers [4], and expand and enrich avenues for active participation in joint problem-solving activity [5]. At the same time, simulations and interactive multimedia can e ngage students and assist in complex visualization [6]. One aim of this research is to design technology-supported activities that synergistically draw on both the individual and collaborative offerings of networked handhelds. Thus, my research draws on literature related to the use of simulations and interactiv e media in physics, as well as collaborative learning and computer-supported collaborative learning. My research will contribute to the bridging of these areas, by deepening our understanding of group sense-making as mediated by collaborative physics activities and simulations. The Physics 7 series at University of California, Davis is a three-quarter introductory Physics sequence for biological science majors. The sequence is unusual in that Physics 7 students spend 5 hours per week in a hybrid Discussion/Laboratory, and only about an hour per week in a trad itional lecture. The goal of these Discussion/Laboratory sections is for students to engage in high-level conceptual reasoning about physics concepts, in what the course designers call "active sense-making." [7] Two main instructional strategies serve th at goal: small group collaboration, and a focus on a small number of conceptual models. Nearly all class work is done in a face-to-face setting in groups of five. Additionally, the course content is structured around a relatively small set of physics models de signed to focus the students X  attention on the  X  X ig ideas X  of Physics. In these Discussion/Lab sections students work through pr oblems, discuss, argue, explain and make sense of physics problems. The PHoTOnICs project is a joint effort by researchers in the UC Davis School of Education and the Physics Department to develop and investigate the use of handheld devices (specifically iPads) in physics classrooms. As part of this project, my dissertation research aims to i nvestigate the technological support of group sense-making in Physics 7. Through successive cycles of design based research, my research will involve the development of technology designs and activities with the dual aims of augmenting the existing class configuration, and contributing to basic understanding of group learni ng about physics as supported by those designs. My dissertation research will be guided by the following primary research questions. 1. In what ways and to what extent do our collaborative My dissertation work will be methodologically grounded in design-based research. Over the c ourse of several design cycles, I will implement a design, collect data on its use in a classroom, and use findings from an analysis of that data in the context of my primary and emerging research questions to guide the next redesign. As my research ques tions ask about both collaborative processes and learning outcomes, I will take a mixed-methods approach to data collection and analysis. In investigating collaborative processes X  X nteractions and participation--my primary data sources will be audio and video recordings of group work during Physics 7 Discussi on/Laboratory sections and log file entries that allow me to reconstruct student interactions with the technology during those sessions. To look at learning outcomes, I will collect samples of student work, both as part of their regular weekly written quizzes, and on assessments designed specifically to target the learni ng objectives of the activity. I will analyze the video data qualitatively, for example using discourse and gesture analysis, to identify participatory processes and group interactions associated with participation in our designed activities. Ultimately I will s eek to correlate identified collaborative processes with assessment outcomes. The first activity design was informed by preliminary classroom observations of two groups as they worked through activities focused on models of simple harmonic motion and mechanical waves. We chose to target waves in the initial design for two reasons: reasoning about waves requi res visualization that is both difficult for students and amenable to simulation, and the coordinated nature of wave motion lends itself well to a collaborative activity design. As such, wave motion represented a good candidate for investigating the affordances of networked handhelds for both the individual and group levels. Much of the observed small group and whole-class discussion revolved around the concept and graphical representation of mechanical waves as sinusoidal variations, both in time and in space . Students had difficulties visualizing the motion of a single point along the wave. At the group level, we noted several instances in which the students appeared to have di fficulties communicating about the dynamic phenomena involved, while only having static media at hand. For example, students would turn their backs to one another to gesture at, in an attempt to  X  X nimate, X  a drawing on a shared chalkboard. Based on these observations, one aim of our design is to equip students with interactive visualizations and shared, dynamic objects that will allow them to more readily reason and communicate about these complex phenomena. Making Waves: First Design Iteration Our first design is an interactive simulation of a mechanical wave made by many independent oscillators lined up along the x-axis. The initial position and direction of each oscillator can be observed and controlled using a "unit circle tool" (Figure 1). When used in the collaborative mode by a group of students, each student has control over the phases of a subs et of the oscillators. When a student changes the phase of an oscillator, the app connects to a local server that communicates the change to the rest of the group. The students are given worksheets asking them to build a wave with a given wavelength and direction, and to explain how their strategy works. To successfully build a wave with the correct wavelength, the group must coor dinate the phases of their individual oscillators. In asking students to perform this coordination, we intend to occasion meaningful interactions around the concepts of phase, relative phase, position and direction, phase intervals, and phase as a function of both position and time. At the same time, we intend for our design to provide students with dynamic interactive visualizations to scaffold those interactions. Classroom Intervention Using these tools, students constructed a wave, along with an explanation of a strategy to change the wave X  X  direction using their  X  X n it circle tools. X  A discourse and gestural analysis of this episode has suggested that the form of students' explanations is strongly tie d to the salient features of the interface. That is, the explanation created by the groups linked together the behaviors of elements of the simulation (and nothing else): the unit circle, the individual oscillator, and the wave profile each were referenced in the explanation, primarily through gestures that mimicked the motions of these elements. In this sense, these elements of the de sign supported the students X  sense-making X  students relied on gesture to refer to the behavior in their explanations, rather than on complex verbal descriptions. Other phenomena such as the relative motion of two oscillators, which was not directly represented on the screen, were not invoked as a part of the group X  X  explanation of their strategy. My current interpretation of this is that the interface does not effectively scaffold talk about the relative motion of oscillators. This may be because this concept is not made salient by a particular onscreen object, or because the lack of such an object to reference in talk makes it too difficult for the students to talk about it. So in the next design iteration, I will add a  X  X omparison X  tool to the interface that will allow students to observe the relative phase between two selected oscilla tors. I suspect that this tool may be taken up in the group discussion and used in the subsequent explanation of wave direction. Designs, data collection, analys es and redesigns are ongoing. As of Spring 2014, I have collected a round of data on the Waves app, am furthering the analys is described above, and am beginning the redesign of the Wa ves app to include the new  X  X omparison X  tool to be used in a second round of data collection this Fall. A second design targeting Circuits will be piloted in the Spring. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1252508. [1] Hake, R. R. (1998).
