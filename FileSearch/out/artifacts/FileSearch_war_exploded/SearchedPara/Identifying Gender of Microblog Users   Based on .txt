 Over the past few years, microblogging services such as Twitter, Sina-Weibo and etc have become increasingly popular platforms for web users to communicate with each other. Popularity of microblogging has gr eatly enriched the way people communicate, while providing convenience for malicious users to engage in criminal activities such virtualness. Many of these online crimes are related with gender camouflage [1]. The famous  X  X yspace mom X  case is the clear ex ample. Therefore, it becomes imperative to design efficient methods for gender identity tracing in cyberspace forensics. 
Unlike traditional documents, messages have their own characteristics such as 1) and grammatical errors; 3) use of hyperlinks to other users and to external resources. It is these characteristics that prevent some standard text mining tools to be employed devoted to microblog user gender identification with content analysis techniques. 
Although author gender identification(AG I)[1,2,3,4] and short text classification have attracted much attention, almost existing AGI techniques ignore the properties such as colloquial and personalization of microblog messages and all the STC short texts. 
In this paper, we will show that true gender of the microblog users can be effectively detected based on their own messages. Microblogger gender identification probl em can be considered as a binary messages to one of two given classes {male, female}. Mathematically, the problem microbloggers with true gender label ()()( ) { } ( v , g i ) denotes microblogger i , approach, { } 1, 1 of the microblogger i , and N is the number of instances in the dataset D. 3.1 Term Features Here we propose a method to extract topic-sensitive terms from the messages posted by a microblogger to form characteristic item features, as can be detailed as below: 
Suppose training message set be mmm m =  X  denotes the messages posted by microblogger i . After preprocessing such as stop words filtering and stemming, a characteristic item set =  X  can be generated, where vec m w w w =  X  . where freq ( t i ) denotes the occurrence frequency of t i in message m i . 3.2 Linguistic Features Based on human psychology research and extensive experimentation, we design three (3) others. Table 1 lists all the 406=(383+10+13) features we designed. Note that some symbols and formulae are described as following: W denotes total number of words that occur i times, Hapax Dislegomena denotes the words that occur only twice, Hapax Legomena denotes the words that occur only once. Function F1(x) denotes average number of x per message of a microblogger. 3.3 Medium Diversity Features Further observation of messages, we can find that messages posted by microbloggers are different from the traditional texts. They have their own particularities, for example, microbloggers can freely add some images and videos in the messages to give others the immersive feeling. Different gender may show some preferences of use such multimedia. To measure the medium diversity of messages, we invented three features, namely, #music /#total, #video /#total, # image /#total. #image , #video and #music respectively denote the number of micro-blogs containing image , video and music . 4.1 Dataset Preparation To experimentally evaluate our approach, we download messages posted by 1000 active users consisted of 486 males and 514 females during the 100 days from September to December in 2012; these registered Twitter users all use true gender information. During this timeframe we gathered a total of 3,643,697 public tweets. 
Since the computed values of the invented features could range from 0 to more and mutual-information-based feature selection method for dimension reduction. We use MATLAB SVM Toolbox (http://www.isis.ecs.soton.ac.uk/resources/svminfo/) for gender classifier training. 4.2 Experimental Results A. Impact of Microblogger Feature Type on Classificati on Accuracy To make clear how the three types of features (Term feature(T), Linguistic feature(L), and Medium diversity feature(M)) respectively influence the classification quality, we features, i.e., T, L, M, T+L, T+M, L+M and T+L+M, of randomly selected 300 male and 300 female microbloggers. Moreover, we produce 7 testing datasets, each of which consists of randomly selected 150 male and 150 female microbloggers. 
Table 2 shows the comparisons of classification accuracy in the 7 datasets of comparing column Total Accuracy(%) of row T, row L and row M, classifier trained two classifiers resulted from dataset of T (term feature) or M (medium diversity However, the two is by no means corr elated linearly. For example, recognition Accuracy(%) and column female Accuracy(% ), can discover that, identical type feature or combination feature possess different gender discriminating ability, in other words, the gender difference between male and female microbloggers exists in discriminating ability of the three types of features. B. Impact of Feature Set Size on Classification Accuracy Section 4 indicates that in contrast with linguistic feature and medium diversity microblogger. So here we just test how the number of term features selected for training a SVM classifier influences the classification accuracy. Experimental results does not increase with the number of term feature set. And its evolution can be described as below: the detection accuracy begins with 0.532 when just choosing the reaches its maximum at the point of selec ting top 2500000 term features, then drop to hand, too more term features can add noise data while representing a microblogger, on the other hand, too less term features may miss some valuable characteristics of a microblogger, both cases can lead to worse performance. identification and proposed a new approach, which extracts different types of features from microblog messages and utilizes a series of pattern recognition techniques, such as feature normalization, feature selection and SVM, to detect microblogger gender. Experimental results show that our approach is effective and promising. Acknowledgement.
