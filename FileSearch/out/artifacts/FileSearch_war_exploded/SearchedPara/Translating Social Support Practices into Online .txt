 The aim of our ongoing research project is to design a platform for family caregivers to help them cope with the burden of daily caregiving. With a view to de signing relevant information and communication services, we analy zed the social support practices observed among the members of a group of caregivers, whose spouses were suffering from Al zheimer X  X  disease. Based on interviews and a field survey, we characterized this collective and identified the caregivers X  latent and expressed needs. Our approach consists in linking th ese needs to naturally occurring situations in order to translate them into meaningful functionalities. D.2.10 [ Design ]: Methodologies . H.3.5.

Caregivers X  Community, Social Support, Healthcare Network, Support Group, Semi-Directive Interviews, Design An awareness of the importance of family caregivers looking after patients suffering from seriously incapacitating diseases is beginning to develop. The role of family caregivers is all the more central when the patients lose th eir autonomy, as occurs in the case of Alzheimer X  X  disease (AD). Patients X  relatives find it hard to cope with playing the role of caregiver for which they have not been prepared. As shown by several surveys on French caregivers X  problems ([20], [33]), in addition to the financial cost of the disease (extra assistan ce with housework, adapting the home, etc.), this situation makes extremely heavy demands on the supporting spouse or relative in te rms of time and attention. Family caregivers often have no training for this difficult role. They have to understand and appl y complex medical instructions, but lack the knowledge and skills en abling them to interact easily and efficiently with the patient, and there exist few channels for expressing their distress. This s ituation is all the more serious since caregivers are completely monopolized by their ailing relative and therefore have very little time to spare for information seeking or for assessing and adapting their practices and social interactions in general. Due to all these problems, caregivers often express the need for help and not only in terms of financial assistance as often proposed by social institutions [20] . They clearly lack a means of expressing their feelings and fi nding a hearing for their problems in order to obtain information and comfort. In our opinion, these needs should be satisfied by the provision of social support, which Thoits' [43] has defined as a  X  X ultidimensional phenomenon that may be expressed through a number of different processes such as the provision of information and advice, help w ith caregiving, or communicating concern and compassion for the caregiver X . Barnes &amp; Duck [2] have also proposed the following general definition for social support:  X  X n exchange of verbal and non verbal messages, which transmit emotion or information in order to reduce the uncertainty or the stress of a person X . Social support of this kind is mainly provided nowadays by associations running traini ng sessions and support groups. Although support groups are useful, th ey have several drawbacks: support is provided only at meetings, and many caregivers do not even have time to attend these meetings. A possible response to this problem is now emerging on the Internet: There now exist many medical web sites which car egivers (and patients) can use to exchange information (there were 900 000 connections per day to the French website  X  X octissimo X  in 2007, for instance). These forums seem to suit their users [28], but they have their limitations because they are very general communication systems, used to discuss not only medical issues but other topics of all kinds, including cooking recipes and how to cope with computer bugs. Our aim is therefore to provide caregivers with a dedicated web-based system which would be ava ilable at all times and provides them with a space where they can share social support with peers. Having access to social support on a daily basis could enable people to talk about their problems immediately rather than letting worries accumulate for a long time before they find a hearing. This aspect is in line with the hypothesis that the benefits of social support provided by peers are mainly short-term benefits [36]. The fact that communications mediated by the Internet with people living elsewhere are anonymous might appeal to people who are reluctant or unable to participate in face-to-face support groups [39]. Online services of this kind would usefully complement the face-to-face services already proposed by medical healthcare networks, as they would improve caregivers X  access to information and help them cope with their distressing situation. The originality of our approach can be summarized as follows: (1) contrary to what we can see in a lot of studies, the members of the collective we are interested in are not the patients themselves ([12], [23], [25]), but relatives acting as caregivers; (2) a survey was conducted on a real-life caregivers X  collective in order to define how to design an efficient tool for providing caregivers with social support. (3) Our design process involves translating the latent and expressed needs of these caregivers into online functionalities dedicated to social support. In this way, it is hoped to develop a design process yielding a tool which can be readily used even by people who are not accustomed to using computer tools. The contents of this paper are arranged as follows: we start by reviewing previous studies on healthcare communities. We then outline the role of spouses who ar e caregivers, before describing the group of caregivers set up by the healthcare network we studied. Based on the interviews we carried out, the group of caregivers under investigation and their activities are described. We then propose an approach to design an online system for caregivers. This approach is based on the translation of caregivers X  latent and expressed needs into web-based functionalities. After defining th is translation process, we illustrate it by giving several ex amples of findings obtained in field study and the interviews conducted, and explain how it is proposed to apply them. This appr oach is then discussed and we conclude by reframing this re search in a more general perspective. A great deal of research has been conducted on how to support people undergoing distressing s ituations. Information and Communication Technologies (IC Ts) have provided many potential solutions for coping with people X  X  distress, in addition to the face-to-face support provided by relatives and friends, health professionals, social workers and institutions. Support provided by technologies is therefore available for coping with a large range of difficult situations resu lting from severe pathologies [6], injuries [28], loneliness and sel f-esteem problems, for example. ICTs address these problems in many ways, which have been described in a large corpus of studies. From our point of view, we can sort these works depending on whether the focus is on the personal or social level: provide support at a personal or family level in order to solve the problems arising at home [ 11], for example by providing screening facilities [24], cognitive assistance for persons suffering from memory disorders [18], ubiquitous computing for aging patients at home [29] or children X  X  healthcare follow up [21]. These projects often involve the use of innovative technological devices (information appliances or mobile phones, for example) in specific settings. Solutions for information exchange between patients, their family, and institutions or professionals ha ve been proposed, but persons and homes have generally been regarded as autonomous units and little attention has been paid so far to the rich and complex social spheres consisting of people in similar situations. social aspects of ICT solutions and goals, including studies on communities of patients [22]. The authors of some of these studies have described existing communities, such as empathic communities ([37], [35]), Virtual Healthcare Communities [12] and patients X  online communities as "communities of unintended interest" [23]. Some research has also focused on leveraging social resources to deal with distressing situations so as to provide people and communities with support and assistance. Studies on these lin es have often consisted in analyzing the complex social environment in which a given situation occurs and the various actors involved, such as health professionals [34], the neighborhood [16] and institutions [5]. 
Based on these analyses and the design requirements thus defined, many ICT devices have been developed in order to provide people in distressing situ ations with social support, information and comfort. Some very different systems have been designed in response to various problems, such as immersive 3-D virtual worlds for patients in hospital ([5], [9]), phone services providing diet communities with advice and a means of sharing their experience [16] and web-based communication and information systems ([15], [25]). Many of these systems have proved to be efficient in their own specific contexts, but many questi ons still remain to be answered about how to design systems for communities [30], and in particular systems dedicated to social support for the members of communities. The aim of the presen t research, in which the social perspective was adopted, was to contribute to defining an integrated approach in which the analysis of communities X  practices is used as a basis fo r designing a social support system. For this purpose, we have been working with a healthcare network dedicated to memory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease in particular, with a view to designing an interactive social support platform for patients' caregivers. Serious neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer X  X  disease (AD) greatly reduce the patients X  autonomy as their cognitive abilities gradually decline. Patients become unable to deal with their own day-to-day requirements as the symptoms worsen, and their relatives have to assist them increasingly with even the simplest operations, such as shopping, bathing, and getting dressed. Here we describe the situation of two typical family caregivers: great deal of time caring for the patient, since they generally live together (70% of the s pouses who are caregivers devote more than 6 hours a day to their partner). These caregivers are 71 years old on average [33] and the patient they care for is approximately the same age. Despite the existence of specialized centers that can take care of patients for a day or half a day per week, caregivers have a heavy load to carry. 
They have to be available day and night and it is difficult for them to leave their spouse alone for even a short time. Their children often live and work far away and cannot easily help them. In any case, s pouses who are caregivers all say they want to protect their children from the burden of caregiving. daughter. These people provide care of various kinds, depending on whether the spouse, who is usually the main caregiver, is able to cope with the situation. Children who are caregivers can take care of their ailing parent during the holidays, assist their mother or father with their everyday care, visit the parent at the nursing home, or share the daily assistance with other brothers and sisters. But this situation is also difficult, whether or not they have to provide regular support (which they often do on a weekly basis), because it adds to the many other responsibilities they already have to carry at their age (the children in the above survey were 52 years old on average [33]), such as their work, their own family, including their children and grandchildren. Caregivers tend to be strongly committed to the support relationship with their ailing relative, whether they are the patient X  X  spouse or child. The assistance they provide takes up a large part of their time and energy and leaves the caregivers little opportunity of escaping and ta king care of themselves. The saturation factors identified among AD caregivers [33] include: caring for the patient more than 2 hours a day, the lack of support at home (assistance with the housew ork), having played the role of caregiver for more than 50 months, and having had to postpone their own medical care or surgery due to lack of time (this was found to be the case with 1 out of every 5 of the caregivers surveyed).  X  X  X seau P X le M X moire X  (RPM) was launched in 2001 by a group of healthcare professionals in response to the many problems arising in the diagnosis and ma nagement of AD patients in the Aube region (N-E France). This healthcare network was gradually set up with the help of a group of research workers to deal with these problems in the framework of research on communities of action [46]. The RPM healthcare network was officially launched in 2005. The main aim of the network is to coordinate the work of the many professionals (neurologist s, general practitioners, social workers, psychologists, etc.) involved in the care and support of these patients. Secondly, it dispenses care by performing neuropsychological screening activities (cognitive testing and diagnosis) and follow-up with patients and their caregivers. The network is also responsible for informing professionals and the public about memory disorders and their treatment: it organizes training sessions for professiona ls and family caregivers and medical symposia for professi onals, and publishes documents (such as booklets and website in formation) targeting various audiences. The RPM also runs monthly support groups for spouses and children who act as caregivers in order to provide them with a space where they can talk about their experience and discuss their problems. The training courses run by the RPM for caregivers also provide an opportunity of meeting other people in similar situations. At each session in these training courses, representatives of all the health professions (physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, neurologists, and psychologists) involved in the care and support process explain how they work and give practical advice about how to deal with patients and solve caregivers X  everyday problems. To collect data about caregivers X  activities and needs, and to determine what kind of group they form, we conducted semi-directive interviews with caregiv ers participating in the support group launched by the RPM. We al so attended meetings of the two support groups run for patient s X  spouses and children. The findings obtained at these meeti ngs were used to study the interactions between caregivers. In this paper, we focus on five interviews with spouses acting as caregivers. It is planned to carry out other interviews with caregivers outside the RPM, such as persons whose parents (their mother or father) are suffering from other diseases (such as Parkinson X  X  disease or cancer) and caregivers who use forums to help them manage their situation. The caregivers we met knew we were working with the RPM network in order to design web-based information and communication services. However, the questions asked generally focused on the caregivers' experience and not only on their use of ICTs and what they thought about that. Most of the caregivers were not very familiar with the use of computers and therefore had few expectations about how ICTs might help them, and designers therefore have to bring their needs to light. The interviews in question c onsisted of four parts: The most obvious aspect of the situation of spouses acting as caregivers is the fact that they spend all day (and sometimes also part of the night) taking care of their ailing husband or wife. The pace increases (as do the problems) with the evolution of the disease. Spouses acti ng as caregivers therefore have to acquire expert skills [4] in many domestic fields (such as washing and dressing disabled people) because the patients X  cognitive abilities are gradually declining. Respondents often compared their work with looking after young children. Thus, it seems possible to examine the trajectory of caregivers as a career [3], like a progressive learning, in the household and also in the support group (to express fear, give advi ses and support...). Caregivers also have to attempt to keep the patient occupied: they watch television together, do memory training exercises (listing capital cities, former presidents, etc. ), read newspapers, and go out walking, for example. Spouses who were caregivers spoke about their need to have some time to themselves (to read, watch their favourite TV programs, consult the Internet, etc.). These moments are crucial, even when the partners are very close, as this quotation illustrates:  X  I had to keep apart so as not to sink with him (her husband died three month ago) (...) I differentiated myself from him... It was hard but...sometimes I left him in his own world... I had to... Maybe that X  X  what saved me  X  (Josiane, 75 years old). In terms of help, caregivers receive a little financial assistance in the form of a monthly allowance, as well as some help with the housework. One of the respondents leaves her husband one day a week at a specialized Alzheime r institution, and the others complain that this service is too expensive. Spouses who are caregivers do not spontaneously mention their doctors (general practitioners or neurologists) among the providers of assistance because these professionals deal with the medical aspects of the disease whereas the RPM network was immediately mentioned among the means of assistance dea ling with the human aspects of the treatment. More specifically, the caregivers said that the training courses organised by the RPM network helped them with the practical aspects of their everyday life ( X  I take a look at my notes every day  X  said Josiane at a support group session). Lastly, those who have children living n earby are supported by them in most cases, and some are helped by neighbours, but this occurs more rarely. The caregivers we met joined the group in two different ways. Some of them had previously attended one or several training courses ran by RPM (in occupationa l therapy, neurological issues, etc.) and intended for relatives of Alzheimer X  X  patients. Other members of the support group had previously consulted the psychologist at the RPM, with or without their ailing husband or wife. In other words, most of the members of the support group had already joined the RPM network and the group we studied here was therefore not an  X  X ntentional community X  [41] (i.e., they did not choose to be together, but the situation in which they found themselves decided for them). It is worth mentioning that unlike most American self-help groups [42], this French support group was not intended to challenge health professionals X  power and knowledge. Up to a point, this support group can nevertheless be said to complete and improve caregivers X  interactions with doctors, which are not very frequent. For instance, obtaining an appointment with a neurologist takes three months without the help of the RPM network. The ai m was not to put lay patients X  experience and professional doctors X  competences on an equal footing, but to provide spouses who are caregivers with support. The support group was initiated by the RPM psychologist, who leads the meetings (and also acts as the network coordinator). The caregivers in the group are very attached to her. One of the reasons for this attachment, which is based on trust, is that the group is based on a truth principle:  X  She does not hide from us what Alzheimer X  X  disease means, that there X  X  a dead end... it is hard to take at the beginning ... some people have just come once to the support group... they say it is depressing... but on the other hand, we find out how to handle specific problems and so on...  X  (Nicole, 66 years old) The interviews also showed that in some cases, the children of caregivers are not aware that the di sease is so hard to deal with, sometimes because the caregiving parent wants to protect them:  X  It is my problem...as long as I can manage... and they have their own life, with their own family...  X  (Agn X s, 60 years old). Unexpectedly, at the onset of th e disease (before the diagnosis), some caregivers report that friends and relatives believe that the spouse may be partly responsible for their partner X  X  disease. At the support group meetings, on the contrary, people believe and listen to each other even if they are talking about everyday details, since they all know that the situation they are going through is very difficult. The link between the support group members is therefore their experience of Alzheimer X  X  disease from the caregiver X  X  point of view, especially because they feel no-one else can understand what it is like unless they have been confronted with this disease:  X  If you have not been through it yourself, you cannot understand what it involves  X  was an expression which cropped up frequently in the interviews. Experience sharing has been previously addressed in research on communities. In the European tradition [31], experience sometimes resembles what Dur kheim and Tonnies have called  X  X motion X  or  X  X ffect X  ([13], [44]), i.e., a means of creating and maintaining a feeling of membership. In more recent studies on communities of practice [45] and epistemic communities [10], experience has also played a prom inent role, although this term in itself has not been frequently employed. For instance, the  X  X hared repertoire of ways of doing things X  [45], where the author refers to communities of practice, includes experience sharing. What collective created by the present support group focuses specifically on the experience of caring for an Alzheimer patient. Although they do not meet very frequently (the support group takes place once a month), the members therefore understand each other and have become attached to each other. Their relationships are rather similar to those which exist between people whose friendship dates back to chil dhood, who have shared past experiences and are happy to meet from time to time although their present lifestyles are diffe rent. There exist, however, two differences between relationships of these two kinds. First, although members of the support group feel they are linked together, this link was created by the RPM network, which differs from the more spontaneous way in which childhood friends are brought together. For instance, when we asked our first interviewee (Paulette, 66 years old) if she met other caregivers outside the organized meetings, she answered:  X  Yes...yes... The last time I saw Madame X (another caregiver in the spouse support group) in the street in Tr oyes, we fell into each other X  X  arms...we are in the same boat, you know  X . The second difference is that the experience these people have in common is lived separately, alone at home, whereas childhood friends share memories of moments they have been through together. The caregivers belonging to the spouse support group can therefore be said to be linked together by  X  X eak ties X  [15] because there are few contacts between the members of the group apart from the regular sessions. From this point of view, Francis (58 year old) told us  X  I would rather speak in terms of links than solidarity  X . He said he deplored this situation although he himself never called other members of th e support group. He also noted the existence of some affinities between a few of the members but not between all of them. Apart from the fact that they were undergoing similar experiences, what were the other ties in this collective? In other words, what are spouses who are caregivers looking for at the support group? The following two points emerged here: people but also to talk about th emselves. The group is therefore not an end in itself but a means of feeling better, as far as possible. disease more clearly, and to acqui re useful information, which helps them to anticipate difficu lt situations with their ailing husband or wife and to deal with their patient more effectively in the future. We will discuss those two aspects in greater detail in the following sections. Our aim here was to bring to light the needs our platform would be designed to meet, from both the social and technical points of view, based on the findings descri bed above. On this basis, the future online services will be designed by translating the needs identified into meaningful functionalities. We are now going to describe this design process. With the approach used here, the role of the designer consisted in translating the needs identified into solutions in the form of computer functionalities. The need s could also have been based on the specifications received fro m the sponsoring institution or from experts in the field. Howeve r, it was proposed to base the design mainly on translating the practices observed and the findings made in the interv iews with end-users. The concept of translation was introduced by Callon [7], one of the main proponents of actor-network theory. This concept, which originally related to innovation pro cesses, refers to the shift from languages, identities, problems, and interests, to other languages, identities, problems and interests. Translation is a movement or a transformation whereby one point of view is substituted for another one. Leaving aside the politi cal aspects of this concept, it seems to provide a useful heuris tic tool for discussing the design approach at two levels. First we noted the respondents X  clearly expressed needs and deduced th eir latent needs from their discourse about their everyday life. Secondly, we interpreted these latent and expressed needs with a view to defining functionalities. In other words, the design approach used here is a two-step translation process. The process of translation from needs to fully specified functionalities has rarely been e xplicitly mentioned by designers ([9], [17], [25]). However, we felt it was worth attempting to breach this gap in order to determine how to guide the translation process, even if all the underlying principles have not yet been elucidated. This approach seemed to be worthwhile for several reasons: 1) it helps to understand why one type of functionality should be preferred to another. 2) It opens the design process to include considerations other than technical ones, such as those relating to the field of social sciences which are then no more restricted to interviews with future users and post-design assessments [38]. 3) It makes it po ssible to define principles for guiding the management of complex activities such as social support activities. The first step in the translation process therefore consisted in identifying the situations giving rise to the needs expressed by caregivers at the interviews a nd support group meetings, as well as their more latent needs. A distinction was made between situations of the following two kinds: ailing spouse, health professionals, relatives and peers (including tips and advice exchanged at RPM support group meetings) desirable for them) in terms of help with which they could be provided which is not currently available (such as respite care services). The links between needs and situ ations were sometimes quite obvious (they were detected upon observing actual practices and confirmed in the interviews or vice-versa ): for example, the need for caregivers to have access to practical information helping them to deal with their probl ems corresponded directly to the situation where they exchanged tips and advice at support group meetings. Some other needs can also lead to looking actively for concrete situations providing a re sponse: the need for assistance with administrative procedures corresponds, for example, to a general situation of assistan ce with paperwork. Sometimes, however, a new situation has to be designed (based on a desirable situation described by caregivers, for example) that will directly or indirectly meet the need: although the need for a respite care service was clearly expressed by caregivers, for example, no situations providing a response to this demand were observed in our field study. It is therefore intended to promote these situations or create new ones via our Internet platform. Translating situations into f unctionalities raises two questions: how to make a situation proposed by the system recognizable by users; and once it has been recognized, how to make the system meet the users' expectations a bout the situation. The following two translation principles were adopted for this purpose: to obtain screen interface components involving signs and words that make the situations presented easily recognizable to users. possible to rely on the conventional  X  X cript X  [40] to guide the interactions. The system has to satisfy the users X  expectations about the situation by providing functionalities that match their  X  X cript X . The idea underlying these principles is to use conventional signs and words as semiotic cues to help users intuitively identify the situation presented online and inc ite them to interact with the system. Once the situation has been identified, the functionalities available must meet the users X  e xpectations about the usual course system which looks familiar to users and can be intuitively handled by them, in line with Carroll X  X  minimalist design principle:  X  X llow learners to get started quickly X  [8]. In order to illustrate this translation process, let us compare discussion forums and question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) functionalities. In fact, people who discuss on the Internet traditionally use forums. Tools of this kind could provide effective means of support, but they do not relate intuitively to the experience of many people. More specifically, speaking to a relatively undefined audience as you do when you post a message on a forum does not correspond to any face-to-face communication situation as defined by Goffman [14]. This partly explains the difficulties users sometimes encounter in appropriating forum systems [27] ; on the contrary, question-and-answer games are implicitly based on common experience. If Q&amp;A functionalities are adopted, users will have a more intuitive grasp of the interactive situati on proposed: they can ask specific questions, they can expect to obtain relevant answers, and they can also browse to obtain previous questions and answers. Users are therefore guided as they inte ract with the system and with other users. Lastly, in our opi nion, Q&amp;A functionalities provide a good example of translation from a real-life situation to a computer-mediated situation, where the users of these functionalities can grasp the context intuitively. The main point here is that the translation process makes the users feel at ease with the interactions. Some features of the situation naturally differ between real-life and computer-mediated communications; users will have of course to renegotiate part of the process, but the interaction management load will still be lighter for them in the end than with general communication systems as forums. We do not claim there is only one way of translating an identified need into one or several functionalities. The point is to develop a su itable design process based on concrete situations to develop a social support platform intended for family caregivers. In order to give a more concrete idea of what the translation process involves, it is now proposed to specify some of the functionalities we plan to integrate into our platform. As we have seen above, the caregivers interviewed talked about the problems they had to deal with every day and how they attempted to solve them. However, very few of their needs were clearly expressed. They encountered many difficulties but they coped with them as best they c ould day after day, and made very few exact suggestions as to how their burden could be lightened. In order to design online services, we have to respond to caregivers X  expressed needs as well as their latent needs, based on the problems and situations they mention. Since spouses who are caregivers experience many difficulties in their everyday life from which it is hard to escape, one specific need emerged from the interviews: the need for a respite care service for caregivers, whereby the spouses of Alzheimer patients could be replaced occasionally at home by somebody who will look after them and occupy them (by playing with Lego X , puzzles, or cubes, for example, as proposed by one of the caregivers interviewed). This service would not have to be provi ded by a specialised institution, and could be used for just a few hours (not necessarily for a whole day each time). The aim would be to give caregivers a chance to  X  breathe  X , to go out to a cinema or the theatre with friends, for instance. This result refers to the French context, where such services explicitly intended for caregivers relief do not exist. There are general task-oriented services, as housework assistance or house keeping services for inst ance, but there is a lack of a global management of such servi ces focusing on relief. This need was formulated along with the di sadvantages of the specialised institutions who look after patie nts on their own premises and above all, the caregivers complained about the cost of these services (Francis, 58 years old, sa id they cost about 80 Euros per day). The caregivers have to take the patient to these institutions by car. They are sometimes far away and travelling with a patient is difficult. Two of the caregivers we interviewed suggested what kind of people could provide this service. Agnes (60 years old) talked about students in the field of healthcare who already have contacts with the RPM network, who could take care of patients for a few hours at a time. Francis (58 years old) said that a respite care service does not have to be managed by doctors and that it should not depend on hospitals:  X  When I say  X  stand-in carers  X , it is not an appeal for people doing voluntary work... but it could be part of the vocational training pr ogramme for students in social work or nursing...in this case, they would look after patients at home... and not in hospital... X .
 Some other needs were less clearly expressed by caregivers, and these latent needs were brought to light by our analysis. In the first place, the caregivers mentioned the fact that they had benefited from the  X  tips  X  and  X  advice  X , received at training sessions and support group meeti ngs. The tips and advice were about problems such as what to do when the patient is wandering around at night, or why, at a certa in stage in the disease, it is important to keep the main door s locked at home and sometimes to close the shutters. The suppor t group constitutes an ideal place for caregivers to exchange tips and advice with each other. These exchanges of good practices were ra rely explicitly mentioned, but were often referred to when disc ussing a specific topic or talking about the problems encountered since the previous support group meeting. However, this was an in teresting point from the point of view of translating caregivers X  pr actices: the caregivers never said they needed tips and advice on an Internet platform, but consistently showed how much they appreciated those provided by the support group and the training courses they followed. Another problem encountered by spouses who are caregivers is that of understanding the impact of the patient X  X  medical treatment. At the support group meetings, they often questioned the RPM psychologist about the reason for each of the drugs prescribed and the possible side-effects. The neurologists or the general practitioners are the onl y person supposed to prescribe treatments and doses, but caregivers are interested in discussing the treatment in order to be able to help their ailing spouse to support it 2 . The last point worth mentioning is the need we identified among these family caregivers for help with administrative procedures, which are very hard to complete: hospital admissions, applying for a place in a specialised institution, applying for the monthly financial assistance, applying to benefit from the activities of a dedicated centre, and coping with death and the formalities involved, for example. Here we present two examples of how the needs mentioned above might be translated. Each example is based on an identified situation, for which it is proposed to design an online equivalent, based on the principles presente d above (mobilizing scripts and conventions). As regards caregivers X  need for tips and advice about how to deal with their everyday problems, we first had to look for a situation where they naturally shared this information with others. Support group meetings provide a privileged opportunity for sharing practical advice with others, and we therefore attended some of these meetings as observers. Howeve r, many situations and events occur during a two-hour support group meeting in addition to the exchange of tips and advice. These exchanges occurred in fact when caregivers were invited to speak in turn on a topic proposed by the support group coordinator (e.g. How did your holidays go? Has your husband or wife ever run away?). Since these "round table" discussions frequently take place at support group meetings, the procedure is familiar to the members of the group and follows a kind of  X  X cript X : caregivers are invited to speak in turn about a given topic, to co mment on what the others have said, and the session comes to an end when they have all expressed themselves. Tips and advice are mentioned in passing by caregivers telling a story or reacting to a peer X  X  story or comment. In addition, "round table discussions" about a topic are not specific to support groups, sin ce they occur at meetings of many other kinds (such as those held by associations and in occupational settings). It is therefore proposed to transl ate the "round table" situation into functionalities. On the one hand, the situation has to be made recognizable by users and we ha ve to look for words and signs which could be used as semiotic cues. The name of the situation constitutes a first order semiotic cue here, for example. On the other hand, the system has to meet users' expectations about the proposed situation by providing functionalities which match the  X  X cript X  of the situation. One user could initiate a round-table discussion by sending a message s uggesting a topic and inviting a group of peers to express themselves about it. Several contributions could then be collected on the same topic and the participants could comment on each other X  X  contributions in the same way as on a blog. The  X  X ound-table X  functionalities will be based on an asynchronous communication device, since caregivers are not able to partic ipate simultaneously. The initiator could close the round-table discussion once all the participants have made a contribution. The system should include a functionality enabling any participant in the online "round table" discussion to mark a contribution (a story or a reaction) as a "useful tip". It is important to draw attention to the term " tip", which was chosen on the basis of the caregivers' interviews and discourse. This term reflects the conventions in use and will theref ore enable caregivers to identify the shareable practical knowledge they call  X  X ips X . A functionality of this kind would enable us ers to browse easily among the contents labeled  X  X seful tips X  and to consult them in the context they had occurred. Among the needs reported by caregivers at interviews were those arising because of the difficulty they had in dosing their spouse X  X  medicines and understanding the pres cribed treatments. Some of them had previously questioned the RPM coordinator; they often asked for further explanations and information at the support group meetings. Sometimes, car egivers even brought their spouses X  prescriptions at the support group session. Of course they no doubt also took the opportunity of asking for information and explanations at each encounter with the numerous health professionals (HPs) who were tr eating their ailing parent. Since caregivers are accustomed to asking questions about medicines and treatments, it would be useful to translate this situation online in terms of a question-and-answ er system. Through the platform, caregivers could put questions to the HPs who are members of the RPM and receive trustworthy answers. However, one caregiver often wanted to put a question to a HP privately (even at the support group meetings, these excha nges occurred in private). Our system therefore has to take into account the possibility of dealing with this expectation of confidentiality, although it would be useful for all caregivers to benefit from their peers X  queries and for HPs not to have to answer the same questions all the time. This is an example of the extens ions ICTs can provide to common real-life situations. One solution could be to anonymize the questions and ask HPs to write their answers in the most general terms possible, as occurs on the Krebsgemeinschaft online platform [25]. Further studies on question-and-answer situations giving the caregivers X  and HPs X  points of view will help us to fully specify this preliminary translation process. Lastly, the question-and-answer situ ation is familiar to caregivers (not only in the context of medici nes and treatments) and could be a part of a larger question-and-answer system on the platform, which could also deal with questions about administrative procedures such as filling in insurance forms. The first point which needs to be discussed is the scope of the system we are designing. In view of the type of collective we have studied here, an open syst em seems to be indicated, as suggested in section 4. In othe r words, it does not seem to be necessary to restrict access to this platform to caregivers who are members of the RPM network. Very few of them are linked by personal ties and above all, they want to share their experience and to learn from others. There is probably no reason why outsiders might not also benefit from the system and contribute to it. The potential users and the needs presented in this paper are complex. The system we intend to develop has to be integrated into this context and the relevant responses to some needs may not be technical ones. For exampl e, a web-based system cannot of course provide a respite care service for caregivers. However, our platform could become a relay fo r finding someone (a person, an institution or an association) who is able to respond to caregivers X  need for a break. This relay func tionality in itself would constitute a situation (using a relay to find the relevant service) that could be translated into our platform on the basis of the principles presented above. The design approach we have developed has to go beyond the scope of a web-based system to respond to caregivers X  needs and improve their social support practi ces. We have to link up with all the existing resources and devi ces (support groups, institutions, associations) and provide caregivers with efficient support in order to really succeed in dispensing situated social support and not just meet a few specific needs online. For example, about the caregivers' need for assistance with administrative procedures: there already exist some services dedicated to helping caregivers to fill in applications for financial aid. The support group coordinator often complained about the fact that caregivers regularly told her they had trouble in filling in the forms and asked her questions, although she had often told them that there existed a dedicat ed service dealing with these problems. In addition, the caregivers did not say that this service had failed to help them. They just felt it was easier to ask the RPM coordinator because they regarded her as the main authority on the disease, and some of them mentioned that it did not cross their minds to contact the appropriate service. The role of our platform as a re lay toward other services and its specific place in the set of existing offline devices providing caregivers with support are at l east as important as the online functionalities it will provide. The first limitation of our approach lies in the fact that the translation process is an interp retative process based on empirical data (interviews and in situ observations). We feel this is inevitable, because design processes imply interpretation. The strength of our approach is that it tends to make this fact and the process of interpretation more explicit. Another interesting point arises wh en a translated need gives rise to a stormy debate among health professionals. For instance, the psychologist and the speech therapists belonging to the RPM network disagree on the subject of memory stimulation, and so do the spouses who are caregivers. At first sight, we thought it was a good idea to promote the use of memory games, but these debates raise ethical questions: is memo ry stimulation necessary and useful for these patients? Is there a risk that the patients may suffer because memory games make them realize how greatly their cognitive abilities have declined? Whatever the case may be, this is still an open question. Another issue concerns the ro le of interactions between caregivers. Our aim to design a system providing more extensive social support practices was no doubt based on the assumption that interactions are positive a nd desirable. But interactions between caregivers could also have negative effects [36] because they make caregivers focus constantly on their problems, without any hope of escape. Lastly, it might also be objected that we are planning to provide caregivers with a web-based system although they are not necessarily capable of using the Internet, especially in the case of elderly people. In our opinion, however, this will no longer be a problem in ten years X  time. In this paper, we have focused on family caregivers X  need for social support to relieve the burden when caring for their relatives. Based on our overview of previous studies on healthcare communities, this can be said to be an original topic as most of the previous studies available have focused on patients. Another point worth mentioning is the fact that the starting point in our design process was the analysis of a real-life group of caregivers. It does not have any existing online practices, but only runs face-to-face support group meetings. The reason for providing online support is that mo st of caregivers lack the time to attend meetings, and sometimes it is even physically impossible for them to attend them. Caregivers have few times to devote to social relationships. We have also described in this paper the method used to design this social support platform based on the translation of latent and expressed needs into functionalities. It was assumed that by using this approach, it would be possible to provide users with a tool strongly related to their real-life practices, which would fulfil their needs and be easy to use. Last but not least, these translation principles are sufficiently abstract and non-technical to be discussed not only by designers and developers but also with social science research workers. This design process is therefore a really interdisciplinary process. The next steps in this study will consist first in integrating the findings obtained in other interviews (with children who are caregivers and caregivers who are active Internet users) and further observations of support group meetings. The combined findings of these two kinds should yield a detailed picture of existing social support practices in both face-to-face and online situations. Our second objective is to complete the description of communication situations between caregivers based on our interviews and observations. We plan to study existing online social support exchanges (on forums) in order to define a kind of communication contract with which users of social support forums implicitly conform. We will then attempt to obtain a more detailed picture of how online interactions could provide efficient social support [26]. Thirdly, we will develop a web-ba sed system dedicated to social support. We will present this syst em to the family caregivers who are members of the RPM, but as explained in section 7, it will also be available on the Internet to caregivers who do not belong to this particular healthcare network. Lastly, this platform will have to be assessed, first as regards its usability, and secondly from the soci al capital point of view with an analytical grid such as that proposed by [19]. The social capital concept will be used to analyze the evolution of family caregivers X  collective equipped with an online social support system. It will then be possible to test our hypothesis that the introduction of an online system is likely to have a positive impact on existing social practices. For instance, [1] have shown how forums can constitute concrete embodiments for communities and develop members X  sense of being part of a collective. In line with these authors, we could examine the question as to how technological t ools may serve as catalysts for communities, in particular.
