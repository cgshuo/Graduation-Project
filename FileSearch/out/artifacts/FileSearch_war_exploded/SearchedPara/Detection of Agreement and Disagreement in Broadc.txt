 In this work, we present models for detecting agreement/disagreement (denoted (dis)agreement) between speakers in English broadcast conversation shows. The Broadcast Conversation (BC) genre dif-fers from the Broadcast News (BN) genre in that it is more interactive and spontaneous, referring to free speech in news-style TV and radio programs and consisting of talk shows, interviews, call-in programs, live reports, and round-tables. Previous work on detecting (dis)agreements has been focused on meeting data. (Hillard et al., 2003), (Galley et al., 2004), (Hahn et al., 2006) used spurt-level agreement annotations from the ICSI meeting cor-pus (Janin et al., 2003). (Hillard et al., 2003) ex-plored unsupervised machine learning approaches and on manual transcripts, they achieved an over-all 3-way agreement/disagreement classification ac-curacy as 82% with keyword features. (Galley et al., 2004) explored Bayesian Networks for the de-tection of (dis)agreements. They used adjacency pair information to determine the structure of their conditional Markov model and outperformed the re-sults of (Hillard et al., 2003) by improving the 3-way classification accuracy into 86.9%. (Hahn et al., 2006) explored semi-supervised learning algorithms and reached a competitive performance of 86.7% 3-way classification accuracy on manual transcrip-tions with only lexical features. (Germesin and Wil-son, 2009) investigated supervised machine learn-ing techniques and yields competitive results on the annotated data from the AMI meeting corpus (Mc-Cowan et al., 2005).

Our work differs from these previous studies in two major categories. One is that a different def-inition of (dis)agreement was used. In the cur-rent work, a (dis)agreement occurs when a respond-ing speaker agrees with, accepts, or disagrees with or rejects, a statement or proposition by a first speaker. Second, we explored (dis)agreement de-tection in broadcast conversation. Due to the dif-ference in publicity and intimacy/collegiality be-tween speakers in broadcast conversations vs. meet-ings, (dis)agreement may have different character-istics. Different from the unsupervised approaches in (Hillard et al., 2003) and semi-supervised ap-proaches in (Hahn et al., 2006), we conducted su-pervised training. Also, different from (Hillard et al., 2003) and (Galley et al., 2004), our classifica-tion was carried out on the utterance level, instead of on the spurt-level. Galley et al. extended Hillard et al. X  X  work by adding features from previous spurts and features from the general dialog context to in-fer the class of the current spurt, on top of fea-tures from the current spurt ( local features) used by Hillard et al. Galley et al. used adjacency pairs to describe the interaction between speakers and the re-lations between consecutive spurts. In this prelim-inary study on broadcast conversation, we directly modeled (dis)agreement detection without using ad-jacency pairs. Still, within the conditional random fields (CRF) framework, we explored features from preceding and following utterances to consider con-text in the discourse structure. We explored a wide variety of features, including lexical, structural, du-rational, and prosodic features. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate detection of agreement/disagreement for broadcast conversation data. The remainder of the paper is or-ganized as follows. Section 2 presents our data and automatic annotation modules. Section 3 describes various features and the CRF model we explored. Experimental results and discussion appear in Sec-tion 4, as well as conclusions and future directions. In this work, we selected English broadcast con-versation data from the DARPA GALE pro-gram collected data (GALE Phase 1 Release 4, LDC2006E91; GALE Phase 4 Release 2, LDC2009E15). Human transcriptions and manual speaker turn labels are used in this study. Also, since the (dis)agreement detection output will be used to analyze social roles and relations of an inter-acting group, we first manually marked soundbites and then excluded soundbites during annotation and modeling. We recruited annotators to provide man-ual annotations of speaker roles and (dis)agreement to use for the supervised training of models. We de-fined a set of speaker roles as follows. Host/chair is a person associated with running the discussions or calling the meeting. Reporting participant is a person reporting from the field, from a subcommit-tee, etc. Commentator participant/Topic participant is a person providing commentary on some subject, or person who is the subject of the conversation and plays a role, e.g., as a newsmaker. Audience par-ticipant is an ordinary person who may call in, ask questions at a microphone at e.g. a large presenta-tion, or be interviewed because of their presence at a news event. Other is any speaker who does not fit in one of the above categories, such as a voice talent, an announcer doing show openings or commercial breaks, or a translator.

Agreements and disagreements are com-posed of different combinations of initiating utterances and responses. We reformulated the (dis)agreement detection task as the sequence tagging of 11 (dis)agreement-related labels for identifying whether a given utterance is initiating a (dis)agreement opportunity, is a (dis)agreement response to such an opportunity, or is neither of these, in the show. For example, a Negative tag question followed by a negation response forms an agreement, that is, A: [Negative tag] This is not black and white, is it? B: [Agreeing Response] No, it isn X  X  . The data sparsity problem is serious. Among all 27,071 utterances, only 2,589 utterances are involved in (dis)agreement as initiating or response utterances, about 10% only among all data, while 24,482 utterances are not involved.
These annotators also labeled shows with a va-riety of linguistic phenomena (denoted language use constituents , LUC ), including discourse mark-ers, disfluencies, person addresses and person men-tions, prefaces, extreme case formulations, and dia-log act tags (DAT). We categorized dialog acts into statement, question, backchannel, and incomplete. We classified disfluencies (DF) into filled pauses (e.g., uh , um ), repetitions, corrections, and false starts. Person address (PA) terms are terms that a speaker uses to address another person. Person men-tions (PM) are references to non-participants in the conversation. Discourse markers (DM) are words or phrases that are related to the structure of the discourse and express a relation between two utter-ances, for example, I mean , you know . Prefaces (PR) are sentence-initial lexical tokens serving func-tions close to discourse markers (e.g., Well, I think that ...). Extreme case formulations (ECF) are lexi-cal patterns emphasizing extremeness (e.g., This is the best book I have ever read ). In the end, we man-ually annotated 49 English shows. We preprocessed English manual transcripts by removing transcriber annotation markers and noise, removing punctuation and case information, and conducting text normal-ization. We also built automatic rule-based and sta-tistical annotation tools for these LUCs. We explored lexical, structural, durational, and prosodic features for (dis)agreement detection. We included a set of  X  X exical X  features, including n-grams extracted from all of that speaker X  X  utter-ances, denoted ngram features. Other lexical fea-tures include the presence of negation and acquies-cence, yes/no equivalents, positive and negative tag questions, and other features distinguishing differ-ent types of initiating utterances and responses. We also included various lexical features extracted from LUC annotations, denoted LUC features. These ad-ditional features include features related to the pres-ence of prefaces, the counts of types and tokens of discourse markers, extreme case formulations, disfluencies, person addressing events, and person mentions, and the normalized values of these counts by sentence length. We also include a set of features related to the DAT of the current utterance and pre-ceding and following utterances.

We developed a set of  X  X tructural X  and  X  X ura-tional X  features, inspired by conversation analysis, to quantitatively represent the different participation and interaction patterns of speakers in a show. We extracted features related to pausing and overlaps between consecutive turns, the absolute and relative duration of consecutive turns, and so on.

We used a set of prosodic features including pause, duration, and the speech rate of a speaker. We also used pitch and energy of the voice. Prosodic features were computed on words and phonetic alignment of manual transcripts. Features are com-puted for the beginning and ending words of an ut-terance. For the duration features, we used the aver-age and maximum vowel duration from forced align-ment, both unnormalized and normalized for vowel identity and phone context. For pitch and energy, we calculated the minimum, maximum, range, mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis values. A decision tree model was used to compute posteriors from prosodic features and we used cumulative bin-ning of posteriors as final features , similar to (Liu et al., 2006).

As illustrated in Section 2, we reformulated the (dis)agreement detection task as a sequence tagging problem. We used the Mallet package (McCallum, 2002) to implement the linear chain CRF model for sequence tagging. A CRF is an undirected graph-ical model that defines a global log-linear distribu-tion of the state (or label) sequence on an observation sequence, in our case including the sequence of sentences sequence of features for this sequence of sentences . The model is optimized globally over the en-tire sequence. The CRF model is trained to maxi-mize the conditional log-likelihood of a given train-ing set sequence One of the motivations of choosing conditional ran-dom fields was to avoid the label-bias problem found in hidden Markov models. Compared to Maxi-mum Entropy modeling, the CRF model is opti-mized globally over the entire sequence, whereas the ME model makes a decision at each point individu-ally without considering the context event informa-tion. All (dis)agreement detection results are based on n-fold cross-validation. In this procedure, we held out one show as the test set, randomly held out an-other show as the dev set, trained models on the rest of the data, and tested the model on the held-out show. We iterated through all shows and com-puted the overall accuracy. Table 1 shows the re-sults of (dis)agreement detection using all features except prosodic features. We compared two condi-tions: (1) features extracted completely from the au-tomatic LUC annotations and automatically detected speaker roles, and (2) features from manual speaker role labels and manual LUC annotations when man-ual annotations are available. Table 1 showed that running a fully automatic system to generate auto-matic annotations and automatic speaker roles pro-duced comparable performance to the system using features from manual annotations whenever avail-able.

We then focused on the condition of using fea-tures from manual annotations when available and added prosodic features as described in Section 3. The results are shown in Table 2. Adding prosodic features produced a 0.7% absolute gain on F1 on agreement detection, and 1.5% absolute gain on F1 on disagreement detection.

Note that only about 10% utterances among all data are involved in (dis)agreement. This indicates a highly imbalanced data set as one class is more heavily represented than the other/others. We sus-pected that this high imbalance has played a ma-jor role in the high precision and low recall results we obtained so far. Various approaches have been studied to handle imbalanced data for classifications, trying to balance the class distribution in the train-ing set by either oversampling the minority class or downsampling the majority class. In this prelimi-nary study of sampling approaches for handling im-balanced data for CRF training, we investigated two approaches, random downsampling and ensemble downsampling . Random downsampling randomly downsamples the majority class to equate the num-ber of minority and majority class samples. Ensem-ble downsampling is a refinement of random down-sampling which doesn X  X  discard any majority class samples. Instead, we partitioned the majority class samples into taining the same number of samples as the minority class. Then we train on the minority class samples and one disjoint parti-tion from the terior probability for one utterance is averaged over the pling approaches as well as the baseline are shown in Table 3. Both sampling approaches achieved sig-nificant improvement over the baseline, i.e., train-ing on the original data set, and ensemble downsam-pling produced better performance than downsam-pling. We noticed that both sampling approaches degraded slightly in precision but improved signif-icantly in recall, resulting in 4.5% absolute gain on F1 for agreement detection and 4.7% absolute gain on F1 for disagreement detection.

In conclusion, this paper presents our work on detection of agreements and disagreements in En-glish broadcast conversation data. We explored a variety of features, including lexical, structural, du-rational, and prosodic features. We experimented these features using a linear-chain conditional ran-dom fields model and conducted supervised train-ing. We observed significant improvement from adding prosodic features and employing two sam-pling approaches, random downsampling and en-semble downsampling. Overall, we achieved 79.2% (precision), 50.5% (recall), 61.7% (F1) for agree-ment detection and 69.2% (precision), 46.9% (re-call), and 55.9% (F1) for disagreement detection, on English broadcast conversation data. In future work, we plan to continue adding and refining features, ex-plore dependencies between features and contextual cues with respect to agreements and disagreements, and investigate the efficacy of other machine learn-ing approaches such as Bayesian networks and Sup-port Vector Machines.
