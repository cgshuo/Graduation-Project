 Studies have shown that the recommendation of unseen, novel or serendipitous items is crucial for a satisfying and en-gaging user experience. As a result, recent developments in recommendation research have increasingly focused towards introducing novelty in user recommendation lists. While, existing solutions aim to find the right balance between the similarity and novelty of the recommended items, they largely ignore the user needs for novelty. In this paper, we show that there are large individual and temporal di  X  er-ences in the users X  novelty preferences. We develop a re-gression model to predict these dynamic novelty preferences of users using features derived from their past interactions. Finally, we describe an adaptive recommender, adaNov-R , that adapts to the user needs for novel items and show that the model achieves better recommendation performance on a metric that considers both novel and familiar items.

The internet supports a giant ecosystem of indepen-dent content providers (such as Amazon, Netflix, Last.fm, YouTube etc.) and consumers (web users). Faced with the needle in the haystack problem, online users rely on rec-ommender systems to find more relevant content. Thus, the personalized recommender systems play a crucial role in making web services more usable and engaging for their Both authors have contributed equally.
 users, directly impacting the success and revenue of such businesses [15].

The common recommendation models are based on either finding items similar to those preferred by the users in the past (content-based) or those consumed by the users most similar to them (collaborative filtering), or a hybrid of these techniques [13, 15]. However, these methods have accrued criticism over time due to their disproportionate emphasis on similarity alone, producing recommendations that are of-ten obvious and redundant. For instance, recommending other songs from the same artist the user liked in the past can be quite accurate but often less useful than identifying unknown artists for the user to try. Over time, the self-reinforcing emphasis on similarity is seen to produce the un-desirable filter bubble e  X  ect [14] associated with decreased content diversity at the user level. Instead, studies reveal that quality and usefulness of recommendations depend to a large extent on how novel, unique and serendipitous they are and how often they include items that the users would not have arrived at on their own [6].

However, a major bottleneck for e  X  orts to introduce nov-elty in user recommendation lists is that they inadvertently reduce the accuracy of the system. Methods which have found success, jointly optimize both the recommendation novelty and similarity (ex: [7]) to find an appropriate com-bination of these factors to better fulfill the needs of the user. The goal of a typical novelty recommender system can be generalized as: where, S u , N u represents the similarity and novelty criteria for the recommendation list R for user u . Furthermore, denotes the trade-o  X  between similarity and novelty, identi-fied by the system to be appropriate for its users. A further appeal of such a formulation is that once defined as such, one can leverage a plethora of optimization tools to determine a domain based .

Recommender systems research has not, so far, consid-ered the problem of attempting to estimate di  X  erent user specific and time-dependent  X  X  based on users X  past behav-iors. Assuming a fixed predicts that users have the same and constant appetite for novel items. However, we believe that it is far more likely for user behavior to vary, seeking familiar (or known) options at some times and being open to explore newer options at others. For instance, users who just started listening to a new artist  X  X  X , are likely to appre-ciate other recommendations of songs from the artist  X  X  X . The same users may however, be more open to trying newer bands, once they have listened to band  X  X  X  several times, favoring more novel recommendations at that point. We de-fine the extent to which the exploratory mode is prominent in users X  behaviors at any moment, as their novelty prefer-ence ( nvP ref u t ).

In this work, we postulate that a recommender X  X  empha-sis on novelty should depend on each user X  X  dynamic novelty preferences. Thus, we propose user and time dependent u t which are a function of users X  dynamic novelty preferences at time t i.e. u t = f ( nvP ref u t ). To realize such an adaptive novelty recommender, we first develop a regression model to predict users X  time-variant novelty preferences. We use fea-tures derived from the users X  past interactions with the sys-tem, based on two specific insights from behavioral psychol-ogy on this subject  X  (a) individual attitudinal di  X  erences in user novelty seeking tendencies [19], and (b) that user novelty seeking desires are associated with disengagement and boredom with their current environment [9]. We con-sider features based on both these factors and show that we can achieve good predictive performance using our model.
We further propose an elegant framework to combine the novelty predictor with existing recommendation techniques to develop an adaptive novelty recommender ( adaNov-R ) for the users. Our system design allows us to optimize our recommendation performance towards novel recommenda-tions for users with high novelty preferences, and focus on familiar items for users with low novelty preferences. This further allows us to test the impact of dynamic novelty pref-erence prediction on actual recommendation performance. By leveraging o  X  -the-shelf collaborative filtering techniques, we make our system easily assessable to existing systems.
In this section we provide a brief overview of related re-search from the field of behavioral psychology and recom-mender systems, relevant to our work.
Several common day experiences, reveal a prominent de-sire in individuals for novel, varied and complex stimuli [4] even at physical, social and monetary costs to oneself. Stud-ies have shown that users have individualized preferences for novelty and variety that vary over time [21, 20]. For ex-ample, users X  variety seeking behaviors di  X  er based on the product category level [21] and display format [20], and user current satiation level with the product attributes [9]. How-ever, most of these studies were conducted from controlled experiments and user surveys. User online multimedia con-sumptions can provide a new lens for studying user novelty and variety seeking behaviors using unobtrusive empirical analysis and modeling methods.

To the best of our knowledge, the only study of this kind has been the recent work by Zhang et al. [25] which mea-sures novelty seeking levels for users from their check-ins and online shopping traces. A major distinction of our work from theirs is that they assume a static multinomial distri-bution for user novelty levels whose mean reflects the novelty seeking trait of the user, while we focus on predicting the dynamics in user novelty preferences. From our experiments we show that in addition to the general propensity towards novelty, the current level of boredom is equally important to predict novelty preference of the user.
Recommendation novelty and diversity has been concep-tualized, measured and evaluated by researchers in di  X  erent ways [22]. Diversity based metrics focus on how dissimilar the recommended items are from each other [2, 14, 26]. Nov-elty, on the other hand focuses on the novelty of the items for the users [8]. In this work, we focus on the novelty met-ric but we expect the learnings from here to carry over to recommendation diversity as well.

Novelty of an item can be relative to user X  X  perspective or system X  X  perspective. An item can be novel to a user in three ways  X  (a) new to system : item is novel for the system and thus for every user in the system (b) new to user : item is known to system but unknown to the user (c) oblivious/forgotten item : item was known to the user in the past but has become somewhat unfamiliar due to the length of time elapsed since its last consumption. Repetition of forgotten items in future consumptions has been shown to produce increased diversity and emotional excitement [17, 3]. In this work, we only consider the type (b) and (c) as novel items for evaluation and do not discuss items of type (a), often referred as coldstart problem [10]. We consider a strict boolean definition of novelty where item is either con-sidered novel by the above definitions or not, for the sake of simplicity. However, our work can be extended to incorpo-rate more relaxed definitions e.g. based on how dissimilar an item is from those seen by the user in the past [22].
Plenty of approaches have been developed to improve the novelty and diversity of recommendation lists such as topic diversification [29], use of item taxonomy [23], bub-ble declustering [27] etc. Others have looked at both the accuracy and the diversity of recommendations and sug-gested approaches for dealing with the apparent trade-o  X  between the two, such as multi-criterion optimization [26], item re-ranking and re-weighting [7] and heat spreading al-gorithms [28]. However, none of these approaches measure their performance in terms of their ability to provide the right amount of novelty as actually desired by the user. Dif-ferent novelty requirements of users make the existing one-size-fits-all approaches insu cient. Instead, in this work, we develop recommendation system that can adapt the novelty provided by the system to the user X  X  need for novelty. We now formalize the terms used in this paper.

Item ( i ): An item corresponds to the unit of resource in the system. This definition includes both individual com-modities like songs, books, movies etc. or their categories such as artist, genre and style. As a result, one can consider recommendation of novel songs, artists or genres using the same methodologies as discussed in this work.

Session ( S ) A session is defined as a continuous period of user activity during which, a user consumes one or more items within a small time gap (identified using a minimum duration threshold). The history of a user u is represented as a sequential list of sessions  X  H u = { S u t 1 ,S u t S x denotes the x -th session of the user starting at time t
Familiar Set ( famSet ) and Novel Set ( nvSet ) For a user u , the familiar set famSet u t at some time t constitutes the set of unique items consumed in sessions falling in the last time window [ t T,t ). To eliminate noise, items which are consumed less than a threshold number of times in the last time window are eliminated from the familiar set. Sim-ilarly, a user X  X  novel set at time t , nvSet u t constitutes the set of items that do not belong to the user X  X  familiar set at time t i.e. nvSet u t = I famSet u t , where I is the set of all the items in the system (see Figure 2a).

Novelty Preference ( nvP ref ) To define a user X  X  novelty preference for a session starting at time t we use the fraction of novel items (items from set nvSet u t ) consumed over the total number of items consumed by the user in that session. The parameter c is a Laplacian correction for small sessions.
For our analysis we use music consumption logs from two popular online music streaming websites. The first is a publicly available dataset from the online music service Last.fm 1 . The other is a more recent (proprietary) dataset from an online music service. Both music services let users either chose specific songs or listen to a radio. We do not have any explicit ratings, or feedback signals (e.g. clicks and likes) other than the act of listening, present in these datasets.

We perform our experiments at both the song and the artist level with similar findings. We only report artist level results due to space constraints. The plots and results for song level results can be found online 2 . To remove inac-tive users from our analysis, we only consider users with more than 20 distinct items listened. The threshold for the gap between sessions is set to 6 hours based on a visual ex-amination of the gap distribution. The time window (T), determines how quickly we update our models to incorpo-rate recent changes in the user interest. We use small time window lengths as music listeners change their music pref-erences frequently. We use one months and three weeks for the Last.fm dataset and the proprietary dataset respectively. For each user, their first time window (session) is used as the burn-in period, the second is used for training and the third is used for testing. For both datasets we include only those items in a user X  X  famSet that were repeated more than 2 times during the time window T . Finally, a Laplace correc-tion c = 3 is used throughout. We summarize the partitions and basic statistics on the datasets in the Table 1.
Surprisingly little has been said in existing recommenda-tion literature, about the actual nature of user consumption of novel items while interacting with system. Via our em-pirical analysis we aim to understand the temporal novelty preferences of the users and thus verify the following two hypotheses: H1: Users have di  X  erent novelty preferences H2: Users have dynamic novelty preferences
We therefore look at the variance (measured using stan-dard deviation) in the novelty preference scores across users www.last.fm http://www.cs.umn.edu/  X  vikas/ Figure 1: novelty deviations across and within users for the and within users, respectively. Figures 1 (1,2) shows the distribution of the session novelty preferences of the users in the first session of the training period. As apparent from the plots, users prefer a substantial amount of novelty in a session. Users consume on an average around 43% and 46% new artists per session in the Last.fm and the pro-prietary data respectively (  X  ( nvPref u t ) Last.fm =0 . 4599,  X  ( nvPref u t ) P roprietary =0 . 434). Furthermore, the across users standard deviations for the Last.fm and the propri-etary datasets is found to be 0 . 1718 and 0 . 176, respectively. Both measures are significantly higher than 0 (p-value  X  0, obtained using one-sided chi-squared test for variance). This suggests that users have significantly di  X  erent novelty pref-erences -Empirical evidence supports H1 .

We then study within users di  X  erences in novelty prefer-ences. For our analysis, we consider the session novelty pref-erence scores of each user as a separate random variable and estimate its standard deviation across sessions in the train-ing period. To obtain a reliable estimate, we only consider users with more than 10 sessions during the training period (Last.fm dataset). Figure 1(3) shows the distribution of the within users standard deviations in novelty preferences. The mean of the distribution (0 . 1206) is significantly greater than 0 (p-value  X  0, obtained using one-sided t-test). This shows that users have significantly changing novelty preferences -Empirical evidence supports H2 .

The individualized and time-varying user novelty prefer-ences render existing novelty recommendation approaches as insu cient, making it critical for new strategies to adapt to the novelty needs of the users for better user satisfaction.
The ability to predict user novelty preferences is crucial for designing an adaptive novelty recommender system. Here, we propose a model that utilizes user X  X  recent consumption behaviors for predicting user preference for novelty. We con-sider two features for this task.

Feature 1: Diversity of their familiar set. Users may have di  X  erent predilections for novelty and diversity. This distinguishes users who repeat favorites on a loop from those who listen to top 10 radio. We identify such di  X  er-ences among users using a simple measure for the diver-sity of their recently consumed items as follows: div u t
Feature 2: Cumulative negative preference for items in the familiar set . Users novelty needs are further associated with the lack of stimulation in their respective environments or boredom [9]. This is equivalent to the users desiring newer items once they have exhausted their collection of known items. In a recent work, Kapoor et. al. [12, 11] propose tech-niques for quantifying user changing preferences for known items given past repetitions and boredom. They use a semi-Markov model for modeling two states of engagement with an item -sensitization state (when users consume the item in short gaps) or the boredom state (when users take longer gaps to consume the item). Using their model, they com-pute item X  X  dynamic preference score ( or dpref ( i,u ) t is based on the user state for the item and time since the last consumption. We use the negative transform of this dy-namic preference score to quantify a user X  X  current boredom with the item. The overall boredom of the user with the familiar set at time t is obtained by summing over the nega-tive dynamic preference scores for each item in the familiar set. negCumPref u t = Table 2: Novelty preference prediction performance evalu-ated using the RMSE metric at artist level.
 Table 3: Feature importance for the logistic regression model
We apply a logistic regression model for predicting nvPref u t . The logistic regression model ensures that our es-timate \ nvPref u t falls within [0 , 1].
The novelty preference prediction model is evaluated us-ing Root Mean Squared Error (or RMSE) between the pre-dicted and actual novelty preference scores for user sessions in the test period. We evaluate our model against a con-stant baseline nvPref to show the benefits of individualized and dynamic novelty seeking prediction. The results are summarized in Table 2. The logistic models ( diversity and diversity + boredom model) perform better than the con-stant model for both datasets. The improvement in per-formance are significant (p-value  X  0 computed using the deviance test chi-squared statistic).

We further analyze our model parameters. Table 3 shows the regression coe cient and the significance level for each feature. Both the div u t and the negCumPref u t features are found to be significant for the prediction task. A positive value of the coe cient for diversity indicates that novelty preference increases with diversity in the familiar set. The boredom related feature negCumPref u t has a positive co-e cient which further indicates that users display higher preferences for novelty when their preferences for the famil-iar set are low and vice-versa.

Finally, we measure how di  X  erent our novelty preferences predictions are across the users. The standard deviation of the predicted user novelty preferences for the test data ( cantly higher than 0 (p-value  X  0, obtained using one-sided chi-squared test for variance). This suggests that our model predicts significantly di  X  erent novelty preferences for di  X  er-ent users. This coupled with the improvement in accuracy suggests that our model can well estimate the individualized and time-variant novelty preference scores for the users.
We now propose an adaptive novelty recommender ( adaNov-R ) to allow existing recommendation techniques to include dynamic user preferences for novelty. Our frame-work ( adaNov-R ) has three main modules, namely -(1) Nov-elty Preference Prediction module, (2) Item Ranking Mod-ule, and (3) Adaptive Recommendation module. We sum-marized these modules in Figure 2b and explain them in details below.

Novelty Preference Prediction Module: The pur-pose of this module is to predict novelty preference scores for a user session. The logistic regression model, described in the previous section, is used for this purpose.
Item Ranking Module: This module produces a pref-erence ranking list for novel and familiar items for each user based on their past interactions (ex: frequency of consump-tion or ratings for an item). Several specialized algorithms can be used for generating novel ( N u t ) [7, 27] and familiar recommendations ( F u t ) [12], respectively.

In our implementation of the module, we use o  X  -the-shelf item-based collaborative filtering technique. The item-based recommender computes preference scores for items based on their similarity to the items already rated by the user. This approach is easy to train and has been shown to achieve good performance in several real world systems [15]. Since, we do not have explicit ratings in our dataset, we modify the item-based recommendation algorithm to include the dy-namic preference score dpref ( i,u ) t (defined in last sub-section) instead of ratings for generating preference scores for items. The modified item scoring function is formulated as: where, j is an item for which the dynamic preference score is predicted, i is an item whose preference score is already known, sim ( i, j ) is the similarity between i and j com-puted using cosine similarity and Neighbors ( j ) are the near-est neighbors (top 50) of item j .

We use this scoring function to generate the ranking list and then extract the ranking lists N u t and F u t . Adaptive Recommendation Module: The Adaptive Recommendation module integrates the other two modules to determine the final top-N recommendations for the user session optimized for the user novelty preference score. The module uses the following scheme to optimize the final pre-ferred list for user:
The dynamic weight used by us for novel items is deter-mined by (a) novelty preference of the user ( nvP ref u t a proportionality constant  X  which allows us to incorporate domain specific emphasis for novelty. For example, recom-menders systems for music may value novelty more than those for holiday destinations as users are more likely to ex-periment more with the former than latter. The dynamic weight for familiar items is proportional to the user X  X  prefer-ence for familiarity (1 nvP ref u t ). After suitable transfor-t we motivated in the introduction section. Further, such an objective function has close resemblance to the value function used in weighted multi-class learning literature [16].
One can use various novelty and similarity (or familiar-ity) criteria based on their application. Refer to [5, 8] for a comprehensive survey of the various novelty and similarity metrics. Here, we use f-measure , a standard metric for eval-uating how well a system can recommend preferred items to the users and is defined as the harmonic mean of the pre-cision ( p ) and recall ( r ) scores. However, vanilla f-measure does not distinguish between recommendation of novel and familiar items. We instead, compute precision, recall and f-measure accuracy metrics, separately for novel and familiar items as follows: p t ( Z )= r t ( Z )= Where, Z can be { fam , nv } .

We define the overall performance metric as the weighted sum of the performance scores on novel and familiar items using our dynamic weights defined above, as follows: wp u t = nvP ref wr u t = nvP ref wp = Avg u,t wp u t ; wr = Avg u,t wr u t ; wF1 = 2  X  wp  X  wr
We follow a greedy approach for learning the right pro-portion of novel and familiar items to include in the fi-nal recommendation. Our approach is based on optimizing our weighted performance metric using the training data. We first segregate users into ten di  X  erent partitions based on their novelty preference scores such that [[0 0 . 1) ! partition 1 , ... ,[0 . 9 1] ! partition 10 ]. We then learn a rule-based novelty introduction function partition i ! x i partitions 1-10 where x i is fraction of novel items in the rec-ommendation list for the best weighted f-measure for parti-tion i . For example, partition i ! 0 . 4 suggests that inclusion of 4 novel items in the top 10 recommendation list provides the optimal weighted f-measure for partition i . Having once trained our novelty introduction function, the Adaptive Rec-ommendation module first uses the predicted novelty prefer-ence score to identify the partition in which the user falls in a future session and then uses the learned fraction for that partition to incorporate an appropriate amount of novel and familiar items in the final recommendations.
We evaluate our adaptive novelty recommender on two as-pects (a) Recommendation Accuracy, and (b) Novelty accu-racy i.e. ability to meet the user X  X  novelty needs. Both these aspects are evaluated for users with di  X  erent novelty prefer-
We compare our model against alternative strategies for novelty recommendation. We first consider the two extreme models PureN -which recommends only novel items and PureF -which recommends only familiar items. We then compare our model against a constant novelty recommender ( CN ) that recommends a constant number of novel items in topN to the users, optimized using the training data. Fi-nally we compare ourselves against the standard item-based recommendation approach (Item Based CF) which only con-siders users X  static item preferences.
We first compare the models on the weighted f measure metric (Figure 3a). First, we see that for  X  = 1, PureF, Item based CF, CN and adaNov-R have an equivalent per-formance, which decreases as user novelty preferences in-crease. This is because when  X  is set to one, we do not incentivize novel recommendations at all and the system naturally favors the recommendation of more accurate fa-miliar items. However, as  X  increases ( &gt; =2), interesting di  X  erences emerge. We see that the performance of Pure-F and item based CF are quite identical and decrease as user novelty preferences increase. The performance of Pure-N on the other hand, increases as user novelty preferences increase. The performance of CN is similar to PureF for low values of  X  (  X  &lt; = 20) and to that of PureN for high values of  X  (  X  &gt; 20), as this model picks the winning side. However, adaNov-R, is seen to adapt it X  X  performance based on user novelty preferences and is better than PureN for low novelty preferences and better than PureF for higher novelty preferences.

We further look at the f-measure metric for familiar and novel items separately. We also show the vanilla f-measure (which does not di  X  erentiate between novel and familiar items) for completeness (Figure 3b). Due to space con-straints, we only show the results for  X  = 10. We see that similarity based methods PureF and Item based CF, and the CN perform well in terms of f-measure (familiar) metric, while PureN works well in terms of F-measure (novel) met-ric. Only adaNov-R maintains good performance for both the metrics. Further, comparing against similarity based methods -PureF and Item-based CF, it performs much bet-ter on F-measure (novel) and is not too worse on f-measure (familiar). Also, as expected, the adaNov-R does not do very well as compared to PureF, Item based CF, CN on the vanilla F-measure metric. But this can be easily related to the fact that none of these baselines focus much on novel recommendation (seen from their dismal performance on the F-measure (novel) metric). Instead, adaNov-R provides per-formance guarantees in terms of weighted F-measure and ensures decent performance on f-measure. Further, a sys-tem can control the decrease in the overall f-measure, by appropriately choosing the  X  that work best for them.
To further evaluate the ability of recommendations to adapt to user needs for novelty, we look specifically at the number of novel items out of N recommended to the user for di  X  erent novelty preferences. PureN, PureF and CN, based on their design, can only recommend the same number of novel items for all ranges of user novelty preferences, while item-based recommends very few novel items (as shown in Figure 3c). Instead, adaNov-R recommends more novel items when a user has a higher novelty preference (for  X  &gt; = 2). Further, we find that the number of novel items recommended is dependent on the domain specific  X  i.e. for low  X  , the system still largely focuses on familiar items only. We therefore recommend using  X  greater than 2 for such datasets.

The ability of adaNov-R to modulate the number of novel and familiar items based on users X  needs while guarantee-ing performance in terms of weighted accuracy (weighted f-measure) make it a much better approach for novelty rec-ommendation than the current non-adaptive systems. Fur-ther, we see that although there is an impact on the overall f-measure metric, the impact can be modulated by choosing the right  X  for the system.
To our knowledge, this is the first work of its kind to con-sider dynamics in user needs for novelty. We show that users had varied and dynamic preferences for novelty and there-fore require specialized adaptive techniques for addressing their novelty needs. We develop a model for predicting the variable novelty preferences of the users with good predictive performance. We also propose an adaptive novelty recom-mendation adaNov-R framework that adapted to the novelty preferences of the users while maintaining a tight control over accuracy using weighted f-measure. We also show how our model successfully caters personalized recommendations to users with di  X  erent novelty needs.

At the same time, there are certain limitations to this work that we can address in the future. Our current approach ig-nores users X  external context and environmental factors such as time of day, mood, social company and whether they are engaging simultaneously in other activities such as working, running or driving etc. which can potentially impact their acceptance and need for novel recommendations. We be-lieve that detailed user evaluation would clearly benefit our approach to further understand the role of external contex-tual factors for novelty recommendation. We would also like to explore novelty preferences of users for other multimedia content like movies, videos, news etc. going forward.
