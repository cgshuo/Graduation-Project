 In the OLAP context, exploration of huge and sparse data cubes is a tedious task that does not always lead to effi-cient results. We propose to use a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) in order to enhance data cube represen-tations and make them more suitable for visualization and thus, easier to analyze. We also provide an original qual-ity criterion to measure the relevance of the obtained data representations. Experimental results we led on real data samples have shown the interest and the efficiency of our approach.

On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a technology supported by most data warehousing systems [1]. It provides a platform for analyzing data cubes according to multiple di -mensions and multiple hierarchical levels [2]. A data cube can be considered as a space representation composed by a set of cells. A cell is associated with one or more measures and identified by coordinates represented by one member from each dimension. Each cell in a cube represents a pre-cise fact. OLAP provides the user with tools to summarize, explore and navigate into data cubes in order to detect inter -esting and relevant information. However, exploring a data cube is not always an easy task to perform. Obviously, in large cubes containing sparse data, the whole analysis pro-cess becomes tedious and complex. Current OLAP provides query-driven tools to browse data cubes, but does not deeply assist the user and help him/her to investigate interesting patterns.

For example, the cube of Figure 1 displays sales of prod-ucts ( P 1 , . . . , P 10 ) crossed by geographic locations of stores ( L 1 , . . . , L 8 ). The way the cube is displayed in Figure 1(a) does not provide an attractive representation that helps a user to easily interpret data. Full cells (gray cells) are di s-played randomly according to the lexical order of their at-tributes in each dimension. The same cube displayed in Figure 1(b) show a data representation easier to analyze. It emerges interesting facts by gathering full cells togeth er. Representation (b) of Figure 1 is obtained from representa-tion (a) by simple permutation of rows and columns.
We propose to provide the OLAP user with an assistance to identify interesting facts of a data cube and display them in an appropriate way that enhances the exploration process . To do that, we suggest to apply a Multiple Correspondence Analysis [3] (MCA) on data cubes in order to enhance their data representations.
Let consider a data cube C , with d dimensions ( D t ) { 1  X  t  X  d } m measures ( M q ) { 1  X  q  X  m } and n facts. We assume that we fix one hierarchical level with p t categorical attributes per dimension. Let a t j the j th attribute of the dimension D and p = P d t =1 p t the total number of attributes in C . For each dimension D t , we note { a t 1 , . . . , a t j , . . . , a its attributes. To apply the MCA, we transform the data of C under a complete disjunctive table . In this table, the cube X  X  facts are considered as the individuals of the MCA, the cube X  X  dimensions as its variables, and the attributes o f a dimension as values of their corresponding variables. The MCA provides a set of orthogonal factorial axis that describ e the most data cloud variance of C . According to the k first factorial axis [3], we build test-values [4] for the attributes of each dimension. We note V t  X j the test-value, according to the factorial axis F  X  , of the attribute a t j from the dimension D . It measures the number of standard deviations between a and the center of F  X  . It also indicates the position of an attribute on a given axis.

In our approach, for each dimension, we arrange its at-tributes according to the increasing order of their test-va lues. This arrangement provides a data representation visually easier to interpret and displays multidimensional informa -tion in a more suitable way for analysis. Test-values provid e a quick appreciation if an attribute has a significant position on a given factorial axis or not [4]. Therefore, our approach also detects from the resulted representation relevant fac ts expressing interesting relationships. To do that, we selec t from each dimension D t a subset  X  t of significant (or char-acteristic) attributes with an error threshold of 1%. The crossing of these particular attributes allows to identify rel-evant cells in the cube.

In order to evaluate the relevance of multidimensional rep-resentations, we propose an original quality criterion. It measures the homogeneity of geometric distribution of the cube cells. Our homogeneity criterion is based on geometric neighborhood of cells and the similarity of cells. It provid es a scalar quantification for the homogeneity of a given data cube representation. The homogeneity criterion of a data cube C is defined as: N ( A ) defines the neighborhood of the cell A in the cube C . It corresponds to the set of all cells B of C who are neighbors of A .  X  ( A, B ) defines a similarity function of two cells A and B . This function takes into account the measure values | A | and | B | of the two cells.

The quality of a multidimensional data representation is rather better when full and similar cells are neighbors. Wit h such a criterion, we can measure the relevance of the orga-nization provided by our method by computing the gain C ini corresponds to the initial cube representation and C org to the organized one.
We realized some experiments on a 5-dimensional cube ( d = 5) constructed from the Census-Income Database 1 of the UCI Knowledge Discovery in Databases Archive 2 . This cube contains 199 523 facts. The aim of these experiments is to measure the homogeneity gain realized by our MCA-based organization on data representations with different sparsity ratios. Figure 2: Evolution of the homogeneity gain accord-ing to sparsity.

According to the Figure 2, the homogeneity gain has an increasing general trend. Nevertheless, we should note tha t for sparsity less then 60%, the curve is rather oscillating around the null value of the homogeneity gain. Our method does not bring a value added to the quality of dense data representation. Our MCA-based organization is rather in-teresting for data representations with high sparsity. We clearly see that the curve is rapidly increasing to high posi -tive values of gain when sparsity is greater than 60%. Actu-ally, with high relative number of empty cells in a data cube, we have a large manoeuvre margin for concentrating similar full cells and gathering them in the space representation.
Currently, we are studying some possible extensions for this work. We consider the problem of optimizing complex-ity of our approach. We also try to involve our approach in order to take into account the issue of data updates. Fi-nally, we project to implement this approach under a Web environment that offers an interesting on-line aspect and a good user interaction context. [1] W. H. Inmon. Building the Data Warehouse .
