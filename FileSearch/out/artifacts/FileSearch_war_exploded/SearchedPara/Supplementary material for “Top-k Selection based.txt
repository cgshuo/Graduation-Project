 [ probability with at least 1  X   X  .
 For the expected sample complexity bound, let n i,j be 1 / Proof. One can get a confidence interval for  X  y i = 1 More precisely, put c i = 1 P [ k Procedure 5 PBR ( X 1 ,...,X K ,  X  ,n max ,  X  ) 1: B = D =  X  Set of chosen and discarded options 2: A = { ( i, j ) | 1  X  i, j  X  K, i = j } 3: for i =1  X  K do 4: n i =0 5: while  X  ( n i  X  n max )  X  ( | A | &gt; 0) do 6: for all i appearing in A do 8: n i = n i +1 Draw a random sample 9: for all ( i, j )  X  A do 10: Update  X  y i,j with the new samples according to ( 11 ) 13: For the implementation of sampling strategies see Section 4 16: ( A, B )= SSRW (  X  Y , K,  X  , C ) Sampling strategy for  X  RW 17: return B
