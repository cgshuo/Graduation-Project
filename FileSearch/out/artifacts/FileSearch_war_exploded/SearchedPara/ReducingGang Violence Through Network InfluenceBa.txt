 In this paper, we study a variant of the social network maximum influence problem and its application to intelli-gently approaching individual gang members with incentives to leave a gang. The goal is to identify individuals who when influenced to leave gangs will propagate this action. We study this emerging application by exploring specific facets of the problem that must be addressed when mod-eling this particular situation. We formulate a new influ-ence maximization variant -the  X  X ocial incentive influence X  (SII) problem and study it both formally and in the con-text of the law-enforcement domain. Using new techniques from unconstrained submodular maximization, we develop an approximation algorithm for SII and present a suite of experimental results -including tests on real-world police data from Chicago.

Violent street gangs are a major cause of criminal activity in the United States [2, 5]. A recent trend has been to-ward development of  X  X mart policing X  tactics to reduce the effectiveness of these gangs. Typically, these strategies have focused on the allocation of law enforcement resources to in-crease arrests and deter criminal behavior. In this paper we focus on a use of  X  X mart policing X  in a different manner: we wish to intelligently target individual gang members with incentives to leave a gang. While  X  X ulling levers X  or encour-aging dis-enrollment from a gang, is already a tactic em-ployed in cities such as Boston and Chicago, the selection of which specific gang members to focus on is still largely unanswered -and hence currently based on ad-hoc meth-ods. In this paper, we study this emerging application as a variant of a social network influence maximization prob-lem [14] that we refer to as the  X  X ocial incentive influence X  (SII) problem. We study this problem both formally and in the context of law enforcement. Then, using new tech-niques from unconstrained submodular maximization [7], we develop an approximation algorithm for SII and present a suite of experimental results -including tests on real-world police data.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss some current methods in law-enforcement used for social program targeting. In Section 3 we introduce the SII prob-lem an associated technical preliminaries. This is followed by a discussion of our algorithmic approach in Section 4 and associated experimental results in Section 5. Finally, we discuss related work in the literature in Section 6.
Recent successes with so called X  X ulling levers X (gang mem-bership dis-enrollment) approaches to deterring violence in-clude the Boston Gun Project and Operation CeaseFire as well as Project Safe Neighborhoods in Chicago, and con-tinue with the on-going Group Violence Reduction Strat-egy in Chicago. Using this approach, law enforcement part-ners work with social service providers and victims advocacy groups to attempt to abate gang violence by  X  X ulling X  what-ever  X  X evers X  need to be applied to street gangs. The types of levers applied, and the degree to which they are employed, depend upon the particular gang. Adjustments are made so that the application is both customized to the specific situation and, hopefully, more successful.

To facilitate these interactions between law enforcement, social service providers, victim X  X  advocacy groups, and street gang members, two approaches are commonly employed. In the case of the first, law enforcement engages known street gang members on the street as part of regular patrol activ-ities. While performed under the auspices of focused de-te rrence, this type of interaction is likely to have the least impact. Time spent with the gang member may be lim-ited, the remaining levers (social service providers, victims groups, etc.) are absent so that the message conveyed to the street gang member is incomplete or biased toward criminal enforcement aspect. Moreover, the selection of target gang members is often random  X  the result of opportunity as the gang member is seen on the street.

In the second approach, gang members are subjected to a  X  X all-in. X  The call-in sessions are prearranged meetings orga-nized by law enforcement, social service providers, and vic-tims groups during which messages of non-violence are con-veyed. The call-in is a full-spectrum effort: law enforcement makes clear to attendees that further violence will be met with relentless police operations and enforcement efforts, so-cial service providers offer information on how members can exit the street gang and obtain educational and vocational training, and victims groups tell stories of loss in an effort to make an emotional plea for violence cessation.
Attendees for call-in sessions are typically chosen in two ways: compulsory attendance and invitation. Gang mem-bers currently on probation or parole are compelled to at-tend. The remaining attendees are invitees, and it is here where the selection criteria may become a bit vague. Invitees may be selected via some form of social network analysis (as in [5]) however such concerted efforts are not entirely relied upon. Often, a large amount of discretion is afforded local law enforcement in selecting invitees. This allows for local gang experts and command staff members to identify those gang members whom they know or suspect to be influential or key members of the gang and invite them to the call-in. This can be a very successful process if the agency has access to these experts or knowledge of the gang X  X  organizational structure. However, there is no guarantee that those per-sons invited are, in fact, genuinely influential in the gang or are just the  X  X ost well known to law enforcement X  members of the gang. In law enforcement, where financial, personnel, and time resources are increasingly constrained, turning a more objective and analytical eye toward invitee selection grows more important.

A key aim of gang dis-enrollment programs is to enable law enforcement to invite to call-ins those gang members who, should the efforts to dis-enroll them be successful, are most likely to pull additional gang members out with them. However, there is a key challenge: are influential members also easy to encourage to leave the gang? A recent empirical study exploring non-criminal online social networks suggests that highly influential individuals are typically not suscep-tible [1]. However, we argue that taking both influence and susceptibility into account are necessary; identifying individ-uals (or groups of individuals) that possess both qualities is needed for the behavior to spread.

Though, to the best of our knowledge, influence maximiza-tion techniques have not been applied to law enforcement be-fore, there is some anecdotal evidence that such approaches could bear fruit. For instance, there have been cases where gang members thought to be  X  X nfluential X  successfully con-vinced others to dis-enroll from the gang. In one case, in Chicago (in the summer of 20130, the district personnel (lo-cal plainclothes gang officers) knew this person to be an influential and as such targeted him for intervention. When he was contacted he indicated that he had already gotten a job, but knew several fellow gang members who could use the offered social services and dis-enrollment opportunities. He personally contacted 20 fellow gang members, of which 7 walked into the local social services facility.
In this paper we frame the problem of  X  X ulling levers X  for-mally as a variant of the social network maximum influence problem [14] in what we call the  X  X ocial incentive influence X  (SII) problem. However, there are some key nuances of the  X  X ulling levers X  strategy that we integrated into our frame-work that are not inherently considered in the maximum influence problem. We list these items here and address our technical approach to each in the next section. 1. Duration of the diffusion process. One key differ-2. Interaction with the population during the dif-3.

Throughout this paper we assume the existence of a social network G = ( V; E ) where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of directed edges. We let n and m denote the cardinality of V and E respectively. For any node v  X  V , the set of incoming neighbors is in v , and the set of outgoing neighbors is out v . The cardinalities of these sets (and hence the in-and out-degrees of node v ) are denoted by k in v ; k out v respectively. For each node v , we assume a cost of marketing to that node denoted by c v  X   X  + . We let C denote the vector of costs indexed by V . We let  X  c  X  denote the average cost  X  v c v =n . We also assume a benefit value, b the associated benefit for having marketed to a given node.
We assume that each node in G has an associated geolo-cation and there exists a distance function d : V  X  V  X  X  X  + that meets the normal axioms: d ( u; u ) = 0, d ( u; v ) = d ( v; u ), and d ( u; w )  X  d ( u; v ) + d ( v; w ).

Using this distance function, we shall assume a level of influence p uv for each edge ( u; v )  X  E that we define using an exponential distance-decay model [23, 16, 22] as follows: where ; r are parameters in the interval (0 ;  X  ) and e is the base of the natural logarithm. The parameter is used as a scaling parameter -and we shall set it to be the average distance between two nodes connected with an edge. The parameter r controls the shape of the distance decay curve, and we shall typically use r = 2. The use of the distance decay function as a proxy for influence is the primary way we address the geographic nature of the law-enforcement data in this application.
 Diffusion Process. A key property that we utilize in our study is submodularity, which we review below: Definition 3.1 (Submodularity). Function f : 2 U  X   X  + is submodular if for every A  X  B  X  U and u  X  U : f ( A  X  X  u } )  X  f ( A )  X  f ( B  X  X  u } )  X  f ( B ) .
Intuitively, the idea of submodularity represents a notion of diminishing returns: adding an element u to a set B can provide no greater benefit than that gained by adding it to any proper subset of B .

Equivalently, function f : 2 U  X   X  + is submodular if for every A; B  X  U , f ( A ) + f ( B )  X  f ( A  X  B ) + f ( A  X 
A set function is supermodular if its negation is submod-ular.

Next, we define a diffusion process function ( dpf ) which accepts an initial set of vertices (called the  X  X eed set X ) and returns the expected number of infectees once the diffusion process completes. In this paper, we shall require this func-tion to be sub-modular and normalized. We provide a formal definition below.

Definition 3.2 (Diffusion Process Function). A dif-fusion process function, dpf : 2 V  X  [0 ; n ] , is any func-tion such that: (1.) dpf (  X  ) = 0 and (2.)  X  V 1 ; V 2  X  dpf ( V 1 ) + dpf ( V 2 )  X  dpf ( V 1  X  V 2 ) + dpf ( V 1
We argue that, in general, these are reasonable restric-tions. For instance, the function of the independent cas-cade and linear threshold models [14], the oracle of the MIA model [11], and the value function of the logic-programming framework of [20] are all valid diffusion process functions. We also note that these previous studies focused only on maximizing the number of expected infectees (subject to a cardinality constraint). In this work, we disregard the cardi-nality constraint and instead seek to maximize profit, which we formally define below.

Definition 3.3 (Profit). Profit, pft : 2 V  X   X  is de-fined by pft ( X ) = b  X  dpf ( X )  X  The SII Problem. We now have all components neces-sary to formally define the social incentive influence (SII) problem:
Definition 3.4 (SII Problem). We are given diffusion process function dpf, social network G = ( V; E ) , cost vector C and benefit value b . Find SII ( dpf ; G; C; b ) = V  X   X  such that pft ( V  X  )  X  pft ( V  X  ) for all V  X   X  V . Not surprisingly, the social incentive influence problem is NP-hard.
 Theorem 3.1. SII is NP-hard.
 Proof. We show NP-hardness by reducing SIMPLE MAX CUT [13] to SII. The SIMPLE MAX CUT problem takes as input a graph G = ( V; E ) and returns sets V 1 ; V 2  X  V such that |{ ( u; v )  X  E : u  X  V 1 ; v  X  V 2 }| is maximized. The fol-lowing construction can be performed in polynomial time. Let dpf ( X ) = each f v is submodular, dpf is submodular. For each v set c = 1 and set b = 1. Then pft ( X ) = |{ ( u; v )  X  E | u  X  X; v  X  V \ X }| . Hence pft becomes equiva-lent to the objective function for SIMPLE MAX CUT. Ho wever, note that our profit function pft is submodular. Proposition 3.1. pft is submodular.

Proof. It is well known that subtracting a supermodular function from a submodular function yields a submodular function. Since dpf is submodular (and b is positive) and the sum of costs is supermodular, the proposition follows. On e-Step Diffusion. As stated earlier, two key challenges in this domain are the duration of the diffusion process and the effect of the law-enforcement personnel interacting dur-ing the diffusion process. This has led us to model the diffu-sion process as a  X  X ne-step X  influence model where we only consider the immediate effect of the diffusion process one time step in the future. Our envisioned use case is that the law-enforcement analysts will use the most current data available to make a decision as to which gang members to reach-out to based on this model. Attempts will be made to influence those individuals, after which changes to the social network (both resulting the outreach and other ex-ternal factors) will be incorporated before repeating the cy-cle. Because we expect the time for diffusion to generally take longer, the repetition of the cycle will generally oc-cur after about one time period. We formally define the following X  X ne-step X  influence model.

Definition 3.5. The one-step diffusion model , 1 : 2
V  X  X  X  + is defined as follows:
No te that we also assume that a node v is infected by a node u independently of which others of its incoming neigh-bors were previously infected. An easy proof shows that 1 is a valid diffusion process function.
 Proposition 3.2. 1 is a valid diffusion process.

Proof. Clearly, 1 (  X  ) = 0 by inspection. Next, we show that the quantity pose, by way of contradiction, that it is not, then we have for V  X  and nodes q; r =  X  V  X  the following for each v  X  Let us assume that q; r are both neighbors of v (the other cases cause both sides to be equal). This gives us the fol-lowing: (1 As 1 &lt; 1  X  p rv which is clearly a contradiction. Note that the supermodularity of this quantity implies the submodularity of 1  X  from the fact that 1 is a positive linear combination of submodular functions.

W e note that we can cause nodes in the argument of this function to be assigned a probability of 1 : 0 by simply adding self-directed edges to each node in the network. We also note, that with many diffusion processes functions, the cal-culation of their outcome may yield an individual probabil-ity of activation for each node. Further, the one-step model also allows for the consideration of benefit as a vector -the probability for each node can obtained by inspecting the in-ner summation -this allows for a more customized setting of benefit on basis of each node (we are currently discussing this as a possibility with our law enforcement partners). In this case, we can identify a specific benefit for each node. The framework can be easily adapted for such a case.
While the submodularity of the pft function is encourag-ing, we note that because marketing to each node incurs an associated cost, it is possible to experience a loss by mar-keting to additional nodes. For instance, if we market to an additional individual who provides us no increase in the diffusion process, this reduces our profit and could lead to a loss. This is not considered in previous diffusion models de-signed to maximize the expected number of infectees. Hence, the greedy approximation of [17] no longer provides us an approximation guarantee. Our case can instead be viewed as an  X  X nconstrained X  submodualr function. Recently, a deter-ministic approximation algorithm was introduced in [7] that requires only a linear number of evaluations of the function. We recall their algorithm here (adapted for SII).
For positive, unconstrained submodular maximization, [7] proves that SII-Approx provides a result that is at least 1 = 3 Al gorithm 1 SII-Approx [7] INPU T: Social network G = ( V; E ), cost vector C , benefit b , distance function d .

Note that pft can potentially provide a solution with negative value. However, we can leverage their results to provide the following approximation guarantee:
Corollary 4.1. Given V ALG as returned by SII-Approx for an instance of SII and optimal soluition V OP T we have the following relationship:
Proof. In the proof of Theorem I.1 of [7], the authors show that pft ( V OP T )  X  3 pft ( V ALG )  X  pft (  X  )  X  pft ( V ). We note that, by definition, pft (  X  ) = 0 and pft ( V ) = bn  X  n ( c  X  b ), which gives the result.

No te that if  X  c  X  X  X  b then we recover the 1 = 3 approximation of [7]. All experiments were run on a computer equipped with an Intel X5677 Xeon Processor operating at 3.46 GHz with a 12 MB Cache and 288 GB of physical memory under the Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.1 operating system. Only one core was used for experiments. Our implementation of SII-Approx was written in Python 2.7 using the NetworkX library 1 .
 Police Dataset. We used a dataset consisting of arrest records of individuals from March 2010 -March 2013 in a single police district in Chicago. This data set included ar-rest location and relationships among the individuals. From this data, we were able to construct a social network ( X  X rrest network X ) consisting of 1836 nodes and 2531 edges. Two in-dividuals in the arrest network are connected if they were arrested together. We note that this is likely an incomplete picture of the full network, but as we move to deployment of this approach by integrating it with our GANG/ORCA analysis software [18], law enforcement personnel can easily supplement or replace an arrest network with information from additional intelligence sources, obersvations by police patrolmen, and data from correctional facilities. Additionally, for some experiments we also generated simu-lated networks to supplement our analysis. h ttp://networkx.github.io/ Da taset Nu m. Av g. M in. M ax. A vg. S td.

Our first test was to evaluate SII-Approx compared to an optimal solution found by enumeration. We did this by sampling the police dataset and by generating simulated networks. We generated 20 connected samples from the overall police network ranging in size from 11 to 20 nodes. We defined cost c v = 1 for all v  X  V and we set benefit b = 1. The worst approximation ratio obtained in these tests was 0 : 70 -more than double the theoretical bound of 1 = 3 in this case. The average-case bound was better still at 0 : 92. Additionally, we also studied the behavior of SII-Approx on several standard generated graph types including complete graphs of size 20 and 25, Erdos-Reyni (E-R) random graphs, preferential-attachment generated scale-free graphs (SF), and the  X  X lorentine Fami-lies X (FF) network [6]. In all of these tests, we never achieved an approximation ratio lower than 0 : 80. The results are shown in Table 1.
 Runtime Evaluation. We evaluated runtime in two ways: (1) we compared the runtime of SII-Approx with an exact enumeration based computation and (2) we studied how SII-Approx scaled with network size. Both results are depicted in Figures 1 and 2. For the comparison with the exact com-putation, we studied the effect of runtime on our 20 samples from the police dataset. We studied at the speedup provided by SII-Approx (defined as the runtime for the exact approach divided by the runtime for SII-Approx on the same input) as a function of network size. We found a significant speedup in all cases and that the speedup increased exponentially with network size ( R 2 = 0 : 96) -which is clearly due to the exponential runtime of the enumeration approach.

Runtime also scaled monotonically with the size of the network (quadratic fit, R 2 = 0 : 97). Hence, for the size of the datasets used by the Chicago police department (order 10 3 nodes), this is a viable approach with the current im-plementation. However, we think further improvement in runtime for the heuristic is possible with further practical modifications.
 Cost Model Evaluation. One of the more useful char-acteristics of our framework is the ability to consider node costs. We studied two variants. First, we studied the case in which all nodes have the same cost, considering several dif-ferent values. Second, we set the cost to be proportional to a network centrality measure. In both cases, we also varied the value of the benefit. We used the entire police dataset in these trials. The results for both sets of trials are shown in Figures 3 and 4.
 Fi gure 1: Network size vs. speedup obtained by SII-Approx over exact approach.
 Fi gure 2: Network size vs. runtime for the heuristic algorithm.
W e examined a fixed/uniform cost model where all nodes we assigned the same value. We examined cost values from 0 : 25 to 2 : 0 in intervals of 0 : 25 and compared them to uniform benefit values in the same range. In general, there was a linear relationship between the benefit and profit for all fixed cost models examined ( R 2 values ranged from 0 : 97 to 0 : 99). Further, as expected, decreased cost led to increased profit.
For our centrality-based cost trials, we studied degree cen-trality (number of adjacent edges), closeness centrality (see [24]), eigenvector centrality (see [4]), shell number (based on shell-decomposition, see [19]), and clustering coefficient (see [24]). Cost was set to be proportional to these values for each node. We also normalized the cost so that the average would be 1 : 0 in each case. Just as with the fixed-cost tri-als, we compared the profit for various benefit values in the range [0 : 25 ; 2 : 0] in intervals of 0 : 25.

For centrality-based cost models, we also observed a lin-ear relationship between benefit and profit ( R 2 values ap-proaching 1 : 0). In examining the difference among central-ity measures, we found the most expensive centralities were degree and shell-number followed by closeness. As these can be considered radial measures of centrality, meaning they measure centrality in terms of the number of paths that originate from a given node, then this result should be ex-pected. Clustering coefficient was less expensive than these measures, which again was as expected as this measure is less dependent upon the number of adjacent nodes and more dependent upon the neighborhood. Perhaps most interest-ing was that eigenvector centrality was the  X  X east expensive X  cost model. We believe that this is due to the wide distribu-tion of values assigned by this measure which ranged from 1 : 66  X  10  X  43 to 166 : 45 (compared to degree, which ranged from 0 : 36 to 6 : 17).

We note that the idea of a cost model is an important fea-ture in our model as it has previously been shown that in-fluential nodes are often not those who most susceptible [1]. This may imply that an individuals who may be influential in the network from a topological perspective may also be of high cost. This is why we considered cost models in our experiment where more central nodes were given a higher cost.
 Heuristic for Improved Solution Quality. SII-Approx , as presented in this paper, does not take into account the order in which the vertices are selected. We found that if vertices are examined in descending order by their Cluster-Rank [8] then the algorithm provided a higher-profit solu-tion when compared to our random baseline (average over 10 runs) for the case of uniform cost (  X  v  X  V; c v = 1) and vari-ous settings for benefit. The results are depicted in Figure 5. In [8] nodes of high ClusterRank were shown to encourage diffusion under the SIR model -which is related to the one-step process of this paper. The ClusterRank of node v is defined as follows: Where C v is the clustering coefficient for node v . This is par-ticularly helpful as the computation of these measures relies only on local information and can be calculated quickly. Ad-ditionally, we examined ordering by degree, clustering coeffi-cient, closeness centrality, shell number, and weighted degree centrality (for each v  X  V the quantity Fi gure 3: Profit obtained from SII-Approx for the po-lice dataset for fixed/uniform cost models with var-ious benefit settings.
 Fi gure 4: Profit obtained from SII-Approx for the police dataset for centrality-based cost models with various benefit settings. all of these measures showed some improvement over the random baseline, they were out performed by ClusterRank for all benefit values above 0 : 5. We are currently examining the performance of centrality-based ordering heuristics on a variety of inputs for the algorithm.
 Iterative Application. We envision real-world police use of SII-Approx to occur in an iterative manner. One way this could be done is as follows: we initially consider a uniform cost model and identify initial nodes to seed. Then, we calculate the diffusion process function based on that seed set in a manner that yields the probability p v of each node v being activated. Then, for the next iteration, we remove from the network all previously seeded nodes (or whichever subset dis-enrolled from the gang) and set the cost for each node v to be 1  X  p v . The intuition is that it will be less expensive to seed nodes that already obtained influence from other members departing the gang. The process of re-setting the cost function and social network prior to re-running SII-Approx is then performed continually.

We applied SII-Approx iteratively five times to the police dataset in the manner described above and studied the size of the set targeted as well as the resulting profit (see Fig-ures 6-7). We observed, under the assumption that all pre-viously seeded members left the gang, that the profit gained decreased monotonically with the number of iterations while the number of targeted vertices increased slightly in the sec-ond iteration, followed by a steep decrease and then con-verged to zero. The success of the second iteration indi-Fi gure 5: Improvement to profit as returned by SII-Approx when the vertices are ordered by Cluster-Rank.

However, beyond the second step, there is limited profit to further marketing for dis-enrollment. We note that at this point, if successful, ap-proximately half of the gang members are dis-enrolled, which would be a significant reduction. Further, we also note that topological changes to the network may become more sig-nificant after the second (and possibly even after the first) round of dis-enrollment.

Iterative application of the algorithm also opens up some new possibilities for future work. For instance, we can view our problem as a sequential decision making problem. The intuition in such an approach would be to not only to max-imize the expected number of dis-enrolled gang members but also to position the law enforcement personnel to more easily influence the network in later iterations. Such an ap-proach may also allow us to consider how the topology of the network will change over time.
The maximum influence problem was introduced in [14] and later studied in work such as [9, 11, 15, 21]. We refer the reader to the book [10] for a summary of recent work in this area. However, to our knowledge, no other work ad-dresses all the challenges presented here for the SII problem simultaneously. For instance, [11] presents a model where the diffusion is restricted to shortest paths -which is a sim-ilar restriction to our one-step model, but does not consider the idea of profit. Likewise, [15] considers the idea of profit, but only applies it to the linear threshold model -which Fi gure 7: Iterative applications of SII-Approx  X  Profit obtained at each iteration. relies on the number of an individuals neighbors reaching a certain threshold. Another issue is that in most of these models, the diffusion process function is difficult to compute -for instance the dpf for the independent cascade model is shown to be # P -hard in [11]. As a result, in most other pieces of work the diffusion process is approximated using simulation, which is as expensive operation. (Most law en-forcement agencies we work with have limited computational power). One notable exception regarding this issue are de-terministic models such as that described in [12, 21]. We note that in our previous work we have looked at utilizing this model in a law-enforcement setting [18, 3]. However the results of that work were primarily used to describe charac-teristics of the gangs and not to make operational decisions. This work did not study the operational issues associated with encouraging gang dis-enrollment as considered in this paper.
In this paper we introduced the  X  X ocial incentive influ-ence X  (SII) problem, a variant of the maximum influence problem, designed to help law-enforcement personnel iden-tify members of street gangs that they can encourage to dis-enroll. We studied this problem both formally and ex-perimentally in the context of the law-enforcement domain. Utilizing techniques from unconstrained submodular maxi-mization, we developed a heuristic technique to help police better identify sets of influential individuals to target with dis-enrollment incentives. We implemented our approach and performed an experimental evaluation. We currently have our approach to the SII problem integrated into our GANG/ORCA analysis software [18] that is currently in use by the Chicago Police. Our next goal is to work with law enforcement personnel to better understand how SII is em-ployed in practice -allowing us to identify components of this framework that can be adjusted for improved results in a real-world setting.
