 1. Introduction
In recent years, improvement in information retrieval (IR) system performance has been primarily due to the efficacy of the algorithms used to match the user X  X  query to the relevant document set contained in the system X  X  database. However, further improvements in IR performance will be obtained from the user side of the equation  X  involving the socio-cognitive algorithms of the user in the search process by shifting the IR search paradigm from an information locating or finding focus to an information use focus. To do this, the IR system will have to substantially increase its interactivity with the user.
In this article we attack a primary obstacle to interactivity effectiveness in improving user search performance, namely the IR system assumption that the user is a kind of  X  X  X nformation man X  who behaves rationally during information search by assumptions in other disciplines are the  X  X  X onsciousness of rationality X  assumption in anthropology ( Lutz, 1992 ; see also, Le-wis-Williams, 2002 ) and  X  X  X conomic man X  in economics ( Camerer &amp; Fehr, 2006 ). Part of the  X  X  X nformation man X  assumption in
IR system research is that in order to maximize information gained for the least effort users of IR systems know what infor-mation they need ( Hearst, 1999 ) and that their information need stays the same from beginning to end of the search session ( Ingwersen &amp; Jarvelin, 2005 ). These IR system assumptions prevent consideration of other user motivational factors when studying human behavior, including such emotion-laden dimensions as how the user X  X  place in the organizational or social group  X  the user X  X  problematic situation in which the need for information occurs  X  affects information seeking behavior.
The social-cognitive complexity and shifting nature of the user X  X  problematic situation when seeking information is the traditional purview of information seeking research ( Saracevic, 2007 ). Information seeking research, however, often consists operationalize information seeking research across contexts for use in interactive IR system design ( Ingwersen &amp; Jarvelin, 2005 ).

Recently, information seeking research has acknowledged the utility of deriving unifying information models and theo-ries from the fundamental concepts underlying human information behavior ( Fisher, Erdelez, &amp; McKechnie, 2005; Spink &amp;
Cole, 2004a, 2004b ), by broadening the research perspective ( Case, 2002; Wilson, 1999 ). In addition, there has been a re-search switch from studying the user X  X  use of information seeking channels for finding information to focusing on the user X  X  ing and from channel use to information use are key changes in the evolution of information seeking research contributing to the development of interactive IR systems. Examples of these tendencies in information seeking research are Bates X  (2005) evolutionary framework for information science and the sense-making approach of Dervin (1992, 1999) . Dervin conceptu-alizes humans as hard-wired theorizers, constantly seeking information from the environment to bridge over gaps in their understanding about a world that is characterized by continuous discontinuity.

This article takes a cognitive-evolutionary approach to studying human information seeking behavior, using the Neander-thals as a benchmark for the study of human brain development. Within this wide perspective, fundamental socio-cognitive mechanisms of information behavior can be ascertained, operationalized and modeled. To facilitate the design of next gen-eration, information use paradigm, interactive IR systems, we propose the socio-cognitive framework model, illustrating how it works with a case study. 2. Lessons from the Neanderthals: Preamble
The cognitive-evolutionary approach to the study of species behavior postulates that for all organisms the primary goal of activity is survival in a hostile and competitive environment; this survival in turn is enabled by the organism efficiently adapting to changes in the social and physical environment. The strength of this approach is that it frames the role of infor-mation in human life as primordial  X  a life force  X  which goes to the very heart of the social and cognitive imperatives that constitute the user X  X  seeking and using information during information search via an IR system.

How do we get at these social and cognitive imperatives of human information seeking? The cognitive-evolutionary ap-proach meets this challenge by examining evidence of human evolution, from which can be inferred basic human cognitive and social operations during information seeking. A rich source of evolutionary evidence is gained from comparing human evolution to a failed but closely related species, the Neanderthals.

It is hypothesized that humans and Neanderthals started from a roughly similar cognitive architecture during the overlap period of the two, evolutionary-distinct species, which some say may have lasted 2000 X 10,000 years ( Delson &amp; Harvati, 2006; Harvati &amp; Harrison, 2006 ; for an alternative view on the overlap, see Donald, 1991 ). Though the Neanderthals were physically stronger, there are various hypotheses about the modern human adaptation that enabled humans to survive where the Neanderthals did not. The  X  X  X ig Leap X  hypothesis states that human survival was due to a chance mutation in hu-man cognition occurring roughly 35,000 years ago ( Mithin, 1996 ). (For a discussion of Mithin X  X   X  X  X ig Leap X  hypothesis, see
Spink &amp; Cole, 2006 .) A contrary hypothesis of human cognitive development is sometimes referred to as the unitary or encephalization hypothesis ( Donald, 1991, pp. 7, 106 ). (The  X  X  X ig Leap X  hypothesis indicates a more nature-triggered view of human brain evolution while the encephalization hypothesis indicates a more nurture-driven view of human brain development.)
In this article, we focus on the encephalization hypothesis. The encephalization hypothesis states that, rather than a great leap forward, modern human cognition followed a more normal evolutionary development tied to the gradual increase in human brain size (possibly driven by human inter-group competition for limited resources ( Alexander, 1990 )). Consistent with this hypothesis, Wynn and Coolidge (2004) attribute the adaptation in human behavior to a moderate increase in the size of human working memory, leading to what they call enhanced working memory (EWM) (see also, Mart X n-Loeches, 2006 ; for a review see, Baddeley, 2001 ). 3. Lessons learned from the Neanderthals: 1. Decoding
Enhanced working memory (EWM) enabled humans to more effectively  X  X  X ee X  or decode unfamiliar environmental stim-uli and is the first lesson learned from comparing Neanderthal and human brain development.

The EWM hypothesis of Wynn and Coolidge (2004) is based on an analysis of tools and other artefacts left to us from the 2000 X 10,000 overlap period when the Neanderthals and humans were believed to live in the same area. Based on this evi-dence, it is surmised that both Neanderthals and pre-EWM humans were experts in tool making, enabling both these groups perts when compared to novices in a given domain immediately  X  X  X ee X  a solution to domain-specific problem.) When expert stone knappers, both pre-EWM human and Neanderthal, came upon a problem,  X  X  X idge orientation, convexities, striking plat-form X  and other such problem or task cues immediately triggered a possible solution retrieval structure from long term memory (LTM) ( Wynn &amp; Coolidge, 2004, p. 12 ). Pre-EWM humans, like their Neanderthal competitors, could only focus their limited working memory attention capacity on the most probable path to successful task solution performance, based on past experience with the same task ( Wynn &amp; Coolidge, 2004, p. 15 ). This type of episodic or strategic-based cognition was effective in a specific domain in which the pre-EWM human and Neanderthal were expert, as shown in the top half of Fig. 1 where a star symbol retrieves encoded episodic or strategic information about how to complete the task from memory; but this episodic or strategic-based cognition was ineffective when the environmental stimulus was unfamiliar or novel, as shown in the lower half of Fig. 1 where unfamiliar environmental stimulus produces an erroneous  X  X  X urkey X  retrieval struc-ture from LTM.

EWM improved the human situation, giving humans an immeasurable advantage over the Neanderthals in terms of sur-vival. Here, we will focus on two advantages of EWM only: 1. EWM enabled humans to juggle multiple retrieval structures in working memory at the same time, including both the known, habitual retrieval/solution structure as well as other less probable retrieval structures, allowing the potential for innovative, inhabitual solution responses to the problem at hand. The alternatives included memory sequences from 2. EWM enabled much better focusing on one solution structure alternative over others that were being considered in work-ing memory, which led to:
We underline the importance of post-EWM humans now being able to retrieve and to hold in EWM multiple response solution/structures to a problem at hand. They are now able to keep in mind an association of elements from the different solution structures, producing the potential for a  X  X  X rofound interweaving of multiple tendencies that give human nature the plasticity and persistence it demonstrates X  ( Eigen, 2007, p. A22 ). The interweaving of multiple solution structures being held in EWM creates a totally different thinking dynamic and advantage for post-EWM humans over their Neanderthal competitors.

For our developing model, we will label the post-EWM human ability to juggle in mind a multiple response set to unfa-miliar or new environmental stimuli as a parallel thinking response to unfamiliar environmental stimuli. The parallel think-ing response to a problem or an unfamiliar environmental stimulus provided an effective, generative-type decoding mechanism for dealing with unfamiliar environmental (problem) stimuli because it allowed for the intermixing or associa-tion of elements from the various human knowledge structures that make up the response (solution) set (see also, Shepard, 1997 ). The generative aspect of this post-EWM human decoding mechanism is shown in Fig. 2 . The generativity is produced among the members of the set of parallel thinking response knowledge structures (KSs) via the interaction of associated ele-ments or dimensions (indicated in Fig. 2 by similar symbols (e.g., stars, ovals, circles)) from one KS interacting (arrows) with the same symbol from other KSs in the response set.
 4. Lessons learned from the Neanderthals: 2. Encoding
The new ability of humans to  X  X  X eneratively X  encode unfamiliar environmental stimuli in new and different kinds of knowledge structures, thus enabling humans to more effectively modify their behavior and adapt to changing environmental conditions, is the second lesson learned from comparing Neanderthal and human brain development.

Donald (1991) traces the evolution of human encoding structures, and the evolutionary divergence between our encoding structures and the Neanderthals X , in his  X  X  X ognitive cultures X  model of human brain evolution. In the Donald model, unfamil-iar environmental stimuli input can be recombinated into invented  X  X  X hole objects X  via generativity. Generativity, at its most fundamental level, is an analytical and combinatorial skill  X  i.e., the  X  X  X eneral ability to form multipart representations from elementary canonical parts X  ( Donald, 1991, p. 71 ); a skill which was enabled by the evolution in the structure of the human of an object, event or situation in the environment but also an ability to generate an invented whole object from different combination sets of these discrete elements ( Donald, 1991 ; see also, Kossyln, 1987 ).

According to Donald X  X  thesis, human brain evolution was driven forward by the ever more complex and effective ability of the brain to construct invented or new whole object mental representations of human existence in a changing, often hostile social and physical environment, thus ensuring their survival in that environment. (For the view that the development of the human social environment was a primary cause of the evolution in human brain development, see Alexander (1990) , who believes brain adaptation in evolution  X  i.e., the development of more efficient knowledge structures  X  was driven by com-petition between human groups, leading to the need for, and the type of knowledge structure, that facilitated intra-group cohesion (see also, Balter, 2007; Palla, Barabasi, &amp; Vicsek, 2007; Spink &amp; Cole, 2007; White, 1982 )).
Donald divides into four  X  X  X ognitive culture X  stages the evolution of the knowledge structure mechanisms of the human brain enabling ever greater generativity and adaptation: 1. Episodic culture : unreflective, concrete, immediate, short-term, situation-bound representations of episodes in the human X  X  life stored in human memory as episodes. episode-bound medium of representation X  ( Donald, 1991, p. 173 ). 3. Mythic culture : the creation of society myth is the beginning of  X  X  X enerative modeling X  ( Donald, 1991, p. 213 )  X  i.e., the conceptual modeling of the human universe or existence inside the objective or physical environment. The need to create and transmit myths in the social group led to the development of language, according to Donald (1991, p. 215) . 4. Theoretic culture : the development of language, analytic thought, grammatical invention, memory-management skills, attentional algorithms and the development of theories linking concepts together in abstract thought ( Donald, 1991, p. 378 ).
 According to Donald, the Mythic cognitive culture was the key evolutionary stage separating modern humans from the
Neanderthals because for the first time it enabled humans to engage in  X  X  X enerative modeling X  of their existence, creating via these models cohesive narratives of human existence that could go backward and forward in time, thus  X  X  X inally tam[ing] the parallel pandemonium of the present-centered archaic sapiens brain X  ( Bownds, 1999, p. 304 ; see also, Sugiyama, 2001 ).
Compared to the episodic and mimetic knowledge structures, the efficiency of the mythic knowledge structure for advancing the encoding imperative  X  the human hard-wired drive to create coherence/sense  X  is illustrated in Fig. 3 . 5. A socio-cognitive framework model for interactive IR design
The socio-cognitive framework model for interactive IR design, shown in Fig. 4 , provides a decoding and encoding frame-work for user X  X ystem interaction. The decoding framework is based on the post-EWM human response set, with increased ability to focus in on improbable alternatives in the set that enabled humans to process and adapt to unfamiliar environmen-tal stimuli by generating new and innovative knowledge (solutions) structures. The encoding framework is the cognitive cul-tures evolutionary framework developed by Donald (1991) . The caption under Fig. 4 describes the components of the model; but first, the model rests on several general principles which we refer to here.

To begin with, there are many possible user reactions to receiving an unfamiliar or unexpected message from an IR sys-tem. The user might ignore the IR system message, and move on to something else. The user might also realize that the sys-tem is not responding in the intended way because the user him/herself is not putting in the right commands. And finally, the user might retain his/her original intention after having received an unfamiliar or unexpected output message from the
IR system, but change tactics. These user reactions to unfamiliar IR system message are common, and result in some form of interactive behavior between the user and the system.

However, to shift IR system design from an information locating or finding focus to an information use focus, we define interactivity in a move robust manner as: an interaction between the IR system and user X  X  memory system for the purpose of is a primary condition of our information use paradigm model because only an adaptive or newly generated cognitive state indicates that the information generated by the user X  X  interaction with the IR system has been used by the user.
Second, we operationally define  X  X  X se X  as the IR system X  X  message being received, decoded and encoded by the user in a new or adapted cognitive state (or knowledge structure) located in the user X  X  memory system, the proof of which is that the adapted cognitive state/knowledge structure produces an output message from the user to the system that is different from what the user originally intended. This is so important to emphasize because IR research has long known that, for an un-known item or topic search, the user X  X  conceptualization of his/her information need into a query does not adequately rep-resent the information need ( Belkin, Oddy, &amp; Brooks, 1982 ) (for various reasons, going back to how users codify their reference questions to librarians ( Taylor, 1968 )).
 The operational definition of  X  X  X se X  requires a  X  X  X ested X  structure for our model, as follows: Input mechanism (for receiving the signal from the IR system) Output mechanism (for preparing the user X  X  message for transmission back to the IR system)
The Input mechanism transduces or translates the signal received from the IR system so that it can be read by the user X  X  memory system. Saracevic X  X  (1996) four level stratified model of interaction effectuates the transduction role by determining the structure or architecture of our socio-cognitive framework model. Saracevic X  X  stratified model was chosen as the struc-turing because it combines and adapts the influential, interactive models of Belkin (1996), Ingwersen (1996) and Spink 1. Information search in its first stratum or level 1 where the user must manipulate the IR system as a machine to effectuate the search. 2. Information seeking X  X  contextualization of the user search in stratum 2  X  the cognitive level. 3. The situational level, which includes the user X  X  problem situation for the search; and 4. The affective or motivational level, including the user X  X  feelings of frustration during the information search.
The Decoding component of the model is a representation of the parallel thinking response set to unfamiliar environmental stimuli. In a paradigm of indeterminism, there is never a true/false binary response condition but rather probabilities are ac-corded to  X  X  X uture states of nature X  which form a response set (see also decision theory, Encyclop dia Britannica, 2008 ). Both which from an evolutionary perspective will shift based on new evidence (i.e., allowing humans to adapt, for example, to changes in the environment such as global warming). In order to measure the IR system X  X  own effectiveness, it is the respon-sibility of the interactive IR system to keep track of these shifting probabilities via uncertainty measuring (see below).
The Encoding component of the model is a representation of Donald X  X  four cognitive cultures, outlined in a previous sec-tion. Encoding takes the individual parts and encodes them into a whole object (from specific-part to general-whole). For encoding, when we  X  X  X ee X  and  X  X  X epresent X  what is out there, there is the pull of our perceptual and cognitive system  X  X  X owards the user the power to intuit  X  X  X orms and functions at the very highest level of complexity X  ( Kemp, 2006, pp. 322, 324 ). One can see this is true if one thinks of complex theoretical theories like Marxism, for example, which is made up from personal, episodic experiences that are mimicked in stories from the Marx X  X  own experiences, before they were widened out to mass appeal as myths. Marxism was given a theoretical framework by interweaving the episodic, mimetic and mythic layers using history, sociology and economic theories.

The Output mechanism transduces or translates the user X  X  behavior, vis- X -vis the operating of the IR system, into infor-mation search strategies and tactics. Belkin, Cool, Stein, and Thiel X  X  (1995) strategic search model provides a framework to structure the user X  X  information search behavior while using the IR system.

In addition, we have added to the model an Uncertainty Marker , a key information science measurement concept which enables the model to evaluate whether or not the unfamiliar IR system message has been successfully decoded and encoded uncertainty levels while successful encoding decreases uncertainty levels. To evaluate the effect of encoding on the user, the model measures the user X  X  uncertainty level before and after decoding X  X ncoding takes place. 6. Case study
We illustrate the socio-cognitive framework model  X  henceforth called the model  X  with the case study of a Ph.D. student at a large Canadian university investigating the negative impact of media on child development. In the study we approxi-mated on paper the experience of using Google and Google Scholar if the model had been incorporated into the search engine X  X  interface.

The case study was the first run through of the model to see if it could be understood easily and if it would seem logical and useful to a potential user of an IR system. The caption under Fig. 4 , which explains the model X  X  four parts, served as a questionnaire for the case study. Each part of the model, designated in the Fig. 4 caption with a separate letter (a X  X ), served as a separate question. Although the model and caption remained in front of the subject on a computer screen throughout the interview, enabling the interviewer to ask a question by pointing to a letter in the caption, the model was not explained to the subject. Overall, the subject seemed to easily answer the questions and to carry out the requested activities. This in-cluded Question c, where the subject was asked to write down four questions she wanted information from the IR system to answer, and Question d, where the subject was asked to draw and label a manual activity, which is shown in Fig. 5 .
On January 15, 2008 the Ph.D. student began the search selecting the query  X  X  X ducation + technology X  which received 77,600,000 hits on Google and 2,660,000 hits on Google Scholar. The system X  X  results list is an example of an unfamiliar sys-tem message to the user. Upon seeing a results list, the user may behave in a number of ways, including giving up in frus-tration. The model assumes, however, that the user has a good reason to conduct the search and would continue if given system support. In this case, the Ph.D. student remarked on the broadness of the information contained in the title and sen-tence fragments of the citations on the first page and asked if ERIC documents were available online. The model immediately divides into Saracevic X  X  four levels which are presented separately to the user but which are intended to work together by integrating various lines of user thinking in response to the unfamiliar message delivered to the user on the results page, and to generate a new strategy or approach to the information search for the user.

For the decoding part of the model, the model asked the Ph.D. student to write out four questions that she wished the IR system would answer with information found during the search. The model then asked the student to give a probability number for each question indicating the probability this question would figure in the final version of her Ph.D. thesis. The four questions with the probability ratings in parenthesis were: 1. How does IT impact critical thinking skills? (35%) 2. How are teachers being trained for using computers in classrooms? (25%) 3. How is computer literacy defined? (10%) 4. How should the subversive nature of children impact pedagogy and curriculum? (30%)
The first question was given the highest ranking (35%) by the student and thus formed the focus of subsequent model processing. With concepts taken from the first question, the model asked the Ph.D. student to query Google. The query in an introductory way. The Ph.D. student commented on five citations from the first page.

For the encoding part of the model, shown in Fig. 5 , the model asked the Ph.D. student to draw a manual activity from her and easily drew a woman holding a hand hoe which points downwards towards a weed; she also drew the surface of the soil, and underneath the surface she drew a complex network of the weed X  X  roots. The student labelled the hoe the  X  X  X rain; X  the weed was labelled  X  X  X urface X ; and the roots were labelled:  X  X  X oot of the issue which is more complicated than what is seen on the surface. X  The labels and the explanation for each label (after the  X  X = X  sign) were as follows: 1. Brain = I X  X  worried that IT will take away from CT skills. 2. Surface = undemocratic society. 3. Root of the issue, which is more complicated than what is seen on the surface = Changing concept of childhood, media, advertising changes childhood, technocracy, corporate influences, power structures.

The model should have asked the Ph.D. student to give new probability rankings to the first list but this was not done (an inadvertent omission).

The model then took the Ph.D. student X  X  explanation concepts for 3. The Root of the issue, and used them as a keyword string in a query to Google Scholar, which produced 214 hits. The student showed interest in the seventh and eighth citation on the first page and then spontaneously clicked on the second page of the results list, the first time the student had shown enough interest to go to the second page.

For the output part of the model, the model took the Ph.D. student through Belkin et al. X  X  Strategic search model which codifies the user X  X  search behavior strategy output into four categories. Each category has two possible alternatives, which are somewhat binary and also open to interpretation (the model, by giving technical definitions for each of the category terms, helped the student to make quick judgments about what the categories actually mean). We chart out the four Belkin nation for the selection.

Method of Interaction: a. Scan b. Search x: She is happy with the results; she will investigate further two citations: Neo sophistry and techno ethics.
Goal of Interaction: a. Learn b. Select x: She will use found information in writing thesis.

Mode of Retrieval: a. Specification x: She will start a new search on  X  X  X echnology and critical thinking skills. X  b. Recognition
Resource Considered: a. Information x: She will go forward with a more specific, narrow query, namely  X  X  X ubversive kinderculture. X  b. Metainformation:
In the final stage, the model focused in on the last category selection (a. Information) and transferred the student X  X  query  X  X  X ubversive kinderculture X  into the query box of Google, producing 97 hits. She immediately remarked on a citation referring  X  X  X oss Beyond Imagining. X  The student commented that it was fiction, which she didn X  X  like, but that she could perhaps use it page, she immediately spotted a footnote at the bottom of the page which contained the name of an author writing on the topic she had never seen before, which she was very pleased with. The model here ended the student X  X  search.
The purpose of the case study example is to show in approximate fashion the decoding and encoding operations the user would be taken through by an IR system with the model incorporated into its design, then to produce an output search strat-egy for the user. The purpose of the case study was to provide a first-run through illustration of how the model could work, not to prove that the model is effective. Proof of the model X  X  efficacy will come in later stages of the research project. How-ever, there were indications in the case study of various benchmarks that could indicate success of the model, for example the Ph.D. student spontaneously clicking on the second page of the results list, presumably because the model X  X  decoding and encoding procedures had raised the student X  X  interest in the results list. And in the final output strategy phase of the model, the student spontaneously opened a citation for the first time and was pleased to find in a footnote an author name related to the concept of  X  X  X ubversive kinderculture X  which she had not seen before.
 7. Conclusion
The socio-cognitive framework model for designing interactive IR systems creates an operational framework for putting the fundamental dimensions of human information seeking behavior into interactive IR system design. To do this, we looked to the fundamental decoding and encoding mechanisms in human information processing derived from a cognitive-evolu-tionary analysis of the reason for the divergence in the evolution of the brains of Homo sapiens sapiens and the Neander-thals. What is it in the human cognitive algebra that enables us to effectively decode and encode unfamiliar environmental stimuli so that humans could successfully adapt to changes in their social and physical environment?
For decoding operations, what distinguished post-EWM modern humans from the Neanderthals was a parallel thinking response to unfamiliar environmental stimuli made up of both probable and improbable solution responses to an unfamiliar stimulus. Where the Neanderthals could not, parallel thinking response enabled post-EWM humans to generate new ways of  X  X  X eeing X  by associating different elements from different members of the Parallel Thinking Response set and then focusing on innovative and effective adaptation responses to changes in the environment, disregarding in the process status quo, habitual responses based on episodic memory alone.

For encoding operations, what distinguished modern humans from the Neanderthals was the development of new, wider encompassing knowledge structures that created their own evolutionary force, an encoding imperative if you like. Donald X  X  (1991) evolution of cognitive cultures is a plausible explanation of the evolution of these knowledge structures into ever more sophisticated human constructs. There is a strong sociological thrust to Donald X  X  description of human cognition that works well for the design of interactive IR systems because so much of information seeking and searching is due to the user X  X  problematic situation. In effect, we have utilized Donald X  X  encoding structure to operationalize the contextual situation for the user X  X  information seeking behavior (his/her place in society, his/her relationship to the environment as it has been rep-resented in myths, etc), so that it can be inserted into the design framework for interactive IR systems.
An important conclusion of our analysis is that current IR systems do not take into account the encoding imperative; rather, current IR systems focus on decoding which leaves the user overwhelmed with information overload. It is our hope that the socio-cognitive framework model for interactive IR system design will facilitate bringing in the encoding imperative, which we predict will increase user satisfaction with these systems.
