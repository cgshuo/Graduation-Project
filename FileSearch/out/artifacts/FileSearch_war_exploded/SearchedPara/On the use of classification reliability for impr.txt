 1. Introduction
Pattern recognition techniques have been widely applied to medical and biological domains, such as mammography quire to handle both binary and multiclass recognition problems. The task of assigning input patterns to two categories is ple features vector x 2 R n and outputs the decision class. On the other hand, it is well-known that discriminating between two classes is much easier than simultaneously distinguishing among many classes [35]. Indeed, most of the available clas-search on using a pool of binary classifiers (dichotomizers) to address multiclass problems, reducing their complexity through the decomposition of the polychotomy in less complex subtasks. To provide the final classification, dichotomizers X  named as decomposition method .

It is worth noting that classifiers ensembles have been widely used for solving multiclass problems also in the framework respectively. Since all these approaches employ an ensemble of binary discriminating functions, for brevity such systems are referred to as Multi Dichotomies Systems (MDSs) in the following.

A problem that arises in the medical as well as in other domains is that the performance of a given classification system can be sometimes unsatisfactory for the needs of real applications. Examples are applications characterized by large data those used to train the classifier [7]. Moreover, in the framework of a recognition system, the knowledge of classification possible percentage of samples that would otherwise be misclassified. However, it introduces a side effect whereby some samples, that otherwise would have been correctly classified, are rejected. The relationship between the error rate and the reject rate is represented as an error-reject trade-off curve, which can be used to set the desired operating point of to assign every sample to a class even at the risk of a high misclassification rate.

The most common choice for reliability evaluation in classification systems consists of using the confusion matrix, which reports for each entry  X  i ; j  X  the percentage of samples of the class x the recognition performance achieved during the learning phase. This approach has been proposed in [23], in the framework cation act. In [13] the authors proposed a reliability estimator for an MDS based on the Error-Correcting Output Code scheme. The limit of their approach is that the proposed reliability does not explicitly depend upon the sample position recent works on multiclass classifiers have demonstrated that more effective solutions could be achieved in two ways: ering the quality of the sample [7,11,15,18] .

This paper proposes a reliability estimator in the framework of an MDS able to take into account the quality of the sample under test. In particular, we present a method working with One-per-Class decomposition schemes. To the best of our We experimentally demonstrate that such a reliability can be used to improve the classification performance of the One-per-by other decomposition methods using reliability measures taken from literature. Moreover, the performance at zero-reject of the proposed One-per-Class scheme improves upon other decomposition methods. In order to verify the actual effective-ness of the proposed approach in medical and biological domains, extensive tests have been conducted on several private and public datasets.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we present a review of the most popular decomposition meth-ods, together with some background about the One-per-Class approach, whereas Section 3 introduces the proposed reliabil-whereas Section 5 reports some conclusions. 2. Background 2.1. Decomposition methods
Given a polychotomy with c classes, apart from some proposals that generate dichotomies in a hierarchical way (see for example the Binary Hierarchical Classifier presented in [25]), the various decomposition methods proposed to-date can be traced back to the following three categories [1,9,13,19,23,27,29,41] .

The first one, called One-per-Class (OpC) and also known as One-against-All , is based on a pool of c binary learning func-formed looking at the function that returns the highest activation [13].

The second approach, commonly referred to as distributed output code , assigns a unique codeword, i.e. a binary string, to sion. For example, the input sample can be assigned to the class with the closest codeword according to a distance measure such as the Hamming distance. In this framework, in [13] the authors proposed an approach, known as Error-Correcting Out-put Codes (ECOC), where the use of error-correcting codes as distributed output representation yielded a recognition system less sensitive to noise. Recently, other researchers investigated the ECOC approach proposing diversity measures between codewords and the output of dichotomizers that differ from the Hamming distance. For example, Kuncheva in [27] presented a measure accounting for the overall diversity in the ensemble of binary classifiers, whereas Windeatt [45] described two techniques for correlation reduction between different codes. As regards classification reliability in ECOC decompositions, in [13] the authors proposed a reliability estimator based on two Euclidean distances: the first between the outputs of the base classifiers and the nearest codeword; the second between these outputs and the second-nearest codeword. The con-fidence is then estimated as the difference between these two distances. The limit of this approach is that the confidence does not explicitly depend upon the position of the pattern in the feature space.
 final decision using a voting criterion. For example, in [23,41] the authors proposed a voting scheme adjusted by the cred-ity of each classification act.

Decomposition methods can be unified in a common framework wherein the output space is represented by a binary code matrix, usually named as decomposition matrix . On its basis, it is then possible to distinguish between the different ap-proaches as follows. Let the c data classes be represented by the set of labels X  X f x position of the polychotomy generates a pool of L dichotomizers, M  X f M upon the decomposition approach adopted. The dichotomizer M ple x in two separate superclasses, represented by the label set X classes. Therefore, the overall decomposition scheme can be specified by a decomposition matrix D 2 R are defined as:
Hence, the dichotomizer M i is trained to associate patterns belonging to class x [28], the most compact decomposition into dichotomies involves L  X d log of dichotomizers is 2  X  c 1  X  1.

As an example, Table 1 represents the decomposition matrices of one-per-class, ECOC, and pairwise coupling, respec-tively, when c  X  4. The code matrix for ECOC has been computed applying an exhaustive code generation approach [13].
Each column corresponds to one class and each row to one dichotomy. Each class is therefore assigned a unique binary string, usually referred to as codeword, given by the corresponding column of the decomposition matrix. 2.2. Problem definition
In the One-per-Class approach, the multiclass problem is reduced into c binary problems, each one addressed by one module of the pool M  X f M 1 ; ... ; M c g . We say that the module, or the dichotomizer, M it aims at recognizing if the sample x 2 R n belongs either to the j th class x
Therefore, binary label of module j on x , M j  X  x  X  ,is1if x 2 x use 0 instead of-1 without losing in generality. On this basis, the codeword associated to the class x omy can be solved not only by a single expert [1,13,28,29], but also by an ensemble of classifiers [37,39] .
Modules, besides labelling each pattern, may supply other information typically related to the degree that the sample be-longs (or does not belong) to the corresponding class. Indeed, it has been proved that exploiting information derived from
Since measurement classifiers can provide more information than other classifiers, we assume that only measurement experts obtain a measurement for each classification act of any kind of classifiers.
 summarized in the following. The used decision rule, i.e. the method for determining the final label assigned to the input module outputs, is a c -bits vector defined by M  X  x  X  X  X  M by each module in the classification of sample x .
 The latter is a vector whose j th element measures the classification reliability on pattern x provided by the j th module.
Formally: w  X  x  X  X  X  w 1  X  x  X  ; ... ; w j  X  x  X  ; ... ; w cates a very reliable classification.

The final decision is given by O  X  x  X  X  x s , with sets the final output O  X  x  X 2 X , and m is defined as m  X  when none module classifies the sample in its own class. 3. Reliability estimation of different fusion rules [7,11] and the assessment of the quality of the outputs provided by the classifier [13].
The novel contribution of this paper is the definition of an estimator that computes the reliability of the final decision taken by an MDS operating in the One-per-Class framework. This estimator, namely / , depends on the reliability profile,
In order to present the rationale of the proposed reliability estimator consider the following analogy. Each specialized module may be regarded as an output neuron of a neural network and therefore the reliabilities w vation potential of neurons. Formally, let us introduce the auxiliaries quantities H where m and  X  c m  X  are the number of modules that vote and do not vote for their own class, respectively. If m &gt; 1 ; H the reliability w s of the selected module and those of the modules whose outputs are 0 contribute to H tively, because all module agree on the final classification. If m  X  0, H module should be larger as long as its own reliability decreases, and H modules whose outputs coherently indicate that the sample does not belong to the class on which they are specialized. As expected, the latter contribution is proportional to the reliabilities of the involved modules.
H a and H b : where the maximum with respect to 0 guarantees that / 2 X  0 ; 1 . Indeed, such a quantity gets bigger in proportion with the difference between the reliabilities of the modules that agree and disagree with the final decision, respectively. 4. Experimental evaluation
The questions raised in the introduction of this paper are: 1. Is it possible to profitably employ a multi-dichotomizer system using the OpC decomposition technique for facing mul-ticlass classification problems within the medical domain? 2. Is the proposed reliability estimation algorithm for OpC-based MDS really effective? 3. Does a OpC-based MDS system using the proposed algorithm for reliability estimation perform better than other MDS systems?
In this section, we provide an answer to each of the above questions from an experimental point of view. Thus, we firstly introduce the adopted experimental protocol. Then, we describe the datasets used to assess the performance of the proposed method. Finally, we report the experimental results. 4.1. Experimental protocol
In the design of the experimental protocol several aspects have been taken into account: the decomposition techniques other approaches for facing multiclass problems, the methodology for validating the results. The experimentations per-formed can be summarized in the following three points that are straightly related to the above questions: 1. The OpC-based MDS has been compared to both multi-dichotomizers and multiclass systems in terms of their recognition rate. Particularly, among the decomposition methods reviewed in Section 2, we selected Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) and PairWise Coupling (PWC). The comparison has been carried out by employing three different paradigms for the basic modules or dichotomizers: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a neural network, a Nearest Neighbor (NN) as a statistical classifier, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a kernel machine. With reference to multiclass systems, we have considered systems based on neural network (MLP) and on statistical classifier (NN). Note that we have not consid-ered multiclass SVM since it is usually implemented through a multi-dichotomizers system. 2. We have assessed the performance of the OpC-based decomposition technique, which uses the na X ve definition of the performance with the one achieved by the OpC-based MDS that uses the proposed reliability estimation algorithm. 3. The proposed OpC-based system has been compared to both the ECOC and the PWC decomposition methods. Following [11,13,22] , we employ the area under the error-reject curve to evaluate and compare the performance of the classifiers with respect to their reliability estimator.

We now briefly report details about the experimental set-up of the classification architectures used. 4.1.1. MLP
We used a MLP with one hidden layer. The number of neurons in the input layer is given by the number of the features number of neurons in the output layer is always two when the MLP is employed as a module of a decomposition technique, have been carried out to determine the best configuration of the MLP in terms of number of neurons in the hidden layer: the best configurations. To evaluate the reliability of MLP decisions for multiclass classification problems we adopted a we omit here the procedure details: the interested readers may refer to [7,11,37] . 4.1.2. NN
The NN required no specific set-up. As with the MLP classifier, to evaluate the reliability of NN decisions for multiclass classification problems we adopted the method reported in [7,11,37] . 4.1.3. SVM
We used a SVM with a Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel. Several preliminary tests have been carried out to deter-nel.Sincethereliabilitytypicallyvariesintherange[0,1],wenormalized d  X  x  X  dividingitwithrespecttothemaximumdistance 4.1.4. OpC
We have employed the One-per-Class decomposition method with the decision rule proposed in [37,39] and summarized before, we have also assessed the performance of the OpC-based decomposition technique which uses the na X ve definition of the reliability /  X  x  X  X  w s  X  x  X  . 4.1.5. ECOC
We have considered the original version of ECOC proposed in [13], that uses the activation value of each single binary classifier to compute the distance between the sample and the codewords. The design of the error-correcting codes has been codes 2 (see [13], Sections 2.3.2 X 2.3.4) for problems with more classes. The measure of the confidence for ECOC is computed in [13], it is calculated as the difference between the L est codeword. 4.1.6. PWC is evaluated, according to [23], by using the confusion matrix calculated on the validation set.
 set and the remaining fold for testing. The validation set was used to avoid overtraining. The procedure has been repeated by averaging over the 10 10 runs (ten times the ten-fold cross-validation tests).

In order to evaluate the performance of the classifiers with their own reliability estimator we employ the error-reject lar value. Inspired by the approach typically adopted in ROC graphs [3,14] , we calculated the normalized Area Under the for each dataset.
 using Student X  X  t -test with a significance threshold a  X  0 : 05. 4.2. Datasets For our tests we used six datasets (two private and four public available within the UCI Machine Learning Repository [2]). the proposed system in different conditions. Synthetic data about the used datasets are reported in Table 2 , while a more detailed description is reported in the following. 4.2.1. Indirect immunofluorescence well fluorescence intensity
Connective tissue diseases are autoimmune disorders characterized by a chronic inflammatory process involving connec-tive tissues. When they are suspected in a patient, the Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) test based on HEp-2 substrate is usually performed, since it is the recommended method. The interested reader may find more details about IIF in [24,36] . The dataset consists of 14 features extracted from 600 patients collected at the Universit X  Campus Bio-Medico di Roma. results are reported in [38] where the authors employed a multiclass approach, achieving an accuracy of 76% approximately. 4.2.2. Indirect immunofluorescence HEp-2 cells staining pattern
This is a dataset with 573 instances represented by 159 statistical and spectral features. The samples are distributed in five classes that are representative of the main staining patterns exhibited by HEp-2 cells, namely homogeneous (23.9%), antibodies giving rise to connective tissue diseases. For details on these classes see [36]. 4.2.3. Dermatology
This is a dataset with 366 instances represented by 33 features. Each class represents an erythemato-squamous disease, such as psoriasis (30.6%), seboreic dermatitis (16.6%), lichen planus (19.7%), pityriasis rosea (13.4%), cronic dermatitis an analysis of the samples under a microscope. Previous results on these data exhibited an accuracy ranging between 94.5% and 96.9% [1,33] . 4.2.4. E. coli
The database is composed by 336 samples, described by a nine-dimensional vector of features and distributed in eight classes. Each class represents a localization site, which can be cytoplasm (42.5%), inner membrane without signal sequence (22.9%), periplasm (15.5%), inner membrane, uncleavable signal sequence (10.4%), outer membrane (6.0%), outer membrane lipoprotein (1.5%), inner membrane lipoprotein (0.6%) and inner membrane, cleavable signal sequence (0.6%). In [23], the authors reported an accuracy that ranges from 79.7% up to 83.0%, achieved employing both a decision tree and a Multi Layer Perceptron, respectively. In [1], using many popular classification algorithms, such as the Support Vector Machines, Ada-
Boost, regression and decision-tree algorithms, the hit rate varies from 78.5% up to 86.1%. 4.2.5. Lymphography
A database of lymph diseases was obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana. It is com-malign lymph (41.2%) and fibrosis (2.7%). Different approaches were used in the literature to address the recognition task.
For instance, for a Na X ve Bayes classifier and a C4.5 decision tree the achieved performance was 79%, and 77%, respectively [6], whereas induction techniques correctly classified the 83% of samples [5]. 4.2.6. Yeast
The dataset is composed of 1484 instances described by 8 features and distributed over 10 classes which represent the with no N-terminal signal (11.0%), membrane protein with uncleaved signal (3.5%), membrane protein with cleaved signal hit rate that varied between 52.8% and 55.7% applying a pairwise coupling decomposition scheme in conjunction with neural network and decision trees. In [1] the best measured accuracy using ECOC decomposition was 58.2%. 4.3. Results and discussion
This section reports the experimental results achieved using the OpC approach with the reliability estimator described so the recognition rate of the proposed system and compared it to both the multiclass (MLP and NN) and other decomposition techniques (ECOC and PWC). Recognition rates were computed considering the 0-reject configuration of the classifiers and for facing classification problems in the medical domain.

Focusing on the second question, we can reformulate it as follows:  X  X  X o we really need the proposed method for reliability estimation or is a na X ve definition enough? X . To answer this question we have calculated the performance in terms of the area under the error-reject curve of the proposed algorithm and of the method using the na X ve definition described in the dichotomizers, the proposed method outperforms the na X ve definition of the reliability.

The last question to be answered is related to performance comparison between the OpC-based MDS with our algorithm for reliability estimation and the other decomposition techniques (i.e. ECOC and PWC). Fig. 2 shows the error-reject curves computed on the six datasets using the OpC, the ECOC and the PWC multi-dichotomizers systems. For space reasons we have reported only the plots regarding the experimental setting that uses the MLP architecture both for multiclass and for the modules of the decomposition methods. The curves relative to the other base architectures are similar, and generally even more favourable to the OpC case. Anyway, the results relative to the NN and SVM cases are synthetically reported afterwards in terms of the AUC.

In Fig. 2 the continuous, the bold and the dotted lines represent error-reject curves of the OpC, ECOC and PWC decom-position methods, respectively, when the MLP architecture is used for the dichotomizers. In all the charts, the points on the extreme left represent the zero-reject performance of the considered MDS, i.e. the error rate attained when the systems classify all samples (they correspond to the performance already reported in Table 3 ).

A qualitative inspection of Fig. 2 shows that the OpC decomposition technique using the proposed method for reliability estimation always outperforms the remaining techniques except for the Dermatology dataset. However, in the latter case the for low values of the reject rate. On the other datasets, the proposed OpC decomposition technique is always the best solu-tion for all the operating points.

The performance of the various approaches under consideration in terms of the AUC are reported in Tables 7 X 9 . Note that the qualitative observations done by visually inspecting Fig. 2 .
 5. Conclusions
Several authors stated that the use of an ensemble of binary classifiers suitably combined can outperform a single multiclass classifier. Moreover, the introduction of a reliability estimator for the classifier output permits to deal with belonging to the medical domain.

While reliability measures have been proposed so far in other multi-decomposition approaches, in the One-per-Class (OpC) framework no works in the literature have explicitly addressed this topic. We have therefore proposed a new method to estimate the reliability of each classification act in this class of decomposition schemes, which does not rely upon the dichotomizers design, i.e. it is independent of the nature of base binary classifiers.

The performance of the proposed method has been extensively evaluated through comparison with both multiclass and both multiclass and decomposition-based solutions. Besides zero-reject absolute hit rate, we have used the area under the error-reject curve to measure the performance of the proposed and others reliability parameters, permitting direct compar-ison among different approaches. Results on six medical databases clearly demonstrated the advantage of the proposed reli-approaches. Moreover, the reported results also confirm the claim that a suitable decomposition method, as the one pro-posed here, can outperform various multiclass systems.

In order to keep limited the number of variable architectural parameters as well as to focus on the performance evalu-
So, future works will be devoted on the one hand to the comparison of the proposed approach to multiclass multi-expert systems for which reliability may be evaluated or can be defined. On the other hand, we will test our estimator on public datasets employing other architectures as base classifiers. Future works will also regard the extension and integration of the proposed reliability-based combination into ECOC and PWC decomposition approaches.
