 iskodor integrates personal collections, peer search, and centralized search services. User modeling in iskodor fills three roles: discovery of sites with suitable information stores, context-based query interpretation, and automatic profile-based filtering of new information. Explanation and control are achieved through graphical depiction of sources, explicit feedback regarding utility, and explicit control over peer as-sociation behavior and information sharing.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Experimentation Web search, explicit relevance feedback, collaborative search
User modeling for information retrieval is an active re-search area to improve the effectiveness of information ac-cess. Two new research directions have been explored in different settings. Lu and Callan [3] demonstrated that user modeling in peer-to-peer networks significantly improves the efficiency of federated full-text search without degrading its accuracy. In the context of web search, the experiments of Agichtein et al. [1] demonstrate a significant improvement of the accuracy of competitive web search ranking algorithms in a realistic environment by incorporating user behavior in-formation. Our goal is to integrate personal collections, peer search, and centralized search services in order to improve web search accuracy. Thus, a user can be made aware of information providers that have contributed to his or her search result, and he gets a personalized access to large in-formation storage. We refer to this integration as congenial web search [2].
The architecture of the iskodor prototype integrates com-mercial web search engines in a virtual peer-to-peer network. All users are organized in the network as peers and main-tain a personal collection. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of an integrated search with iskodor . In general, the inte-
