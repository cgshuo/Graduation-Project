Algorithms, Design, Human Factors Collaborative information seekin g, group support, user support In various work domains, the collaborative performance of a work task by a team can lead to a shared information need required to fulfill this task. Many empirical studies identified collaborative information seeking and searching (IS&amp;S) as everyday work patterns in order to solve a shared information need and to benefit from the diverse expertise and experience of the team members. Such studies have been conducted, for example, in the field of engineering and design [1], and the patent domain [2], to name a few. In everyday work practices, collabor ation is realized by utilizing a broad range of software tools. Recent empirical studies show that, despite the increasing availability of tools that are specifically designed to support collaborative IS&amp;S, these tec hnologies are not used in practice [3]. Instead, simpler communication technologies that are part of the everyday work are used as means to realize collaborative IS&amp;S. These t ools build a heterogeneous collaboration environment along w ith the users. However, current collaborative IS&amp;S solutions do not consider the usage of these tools as well as information produced or managed with these tools, even though they provide potentially valuable awareness information. Besides the textual content created and managed by the tools in use, users also interact with each other in many ways and in this way build collaboration networks . In the proposed research, I investigate an approach which exploits these heterogeneous collaboration environm ents and such networks by collecting semantic knowledge from the utilized tools about the individuals and their relation information. By linking the Information Retrieval (IR) activities of the group members with the data accessible through these tools, a knowledge-base (KB) is build up. This KB is than utilized for inference of situational support for the co-workers in every phase of the search process. Previous research in the field of collaborative IS&amp;S has conceptualized, implemented and evaluated tools and systems for use at each stage of the information searching process: (1) query construction, (2) obtaining results , and (3) evaluating and using the results. However, these systems do not provide information on the best suited collaboration partne rs and the collaborative activity to be performed to increase the effectiveness of the collaborative performance of IS&amp;S tasks. To close this gap, in the propos ed research a group support system (GSS) on top of the KB will be developed. This GSS aims at increasing the group performance by (1) encouraging query diversity, (2) providing already discovered information, and (3) facilitating the alignment of result assessment. Based on semantic link analysis, the GSS suggests the best suited collaborative activity to be performed by a co-worker in terms of search effectiveness of the group. As basis for my research approach it is planned to extend the ezDL system (Easy Access to Digital Libraries: http://www.ezdl.de) by collaborativ e features as well as the KB-based group support system. In a user study run at the distance learning university at Hagen I will evaluate the developed system and identify to which extend collaboration support in form of suggested activities can improve the synergetic effects [4] of the collaborative performance of IS&amp;S tasks.
