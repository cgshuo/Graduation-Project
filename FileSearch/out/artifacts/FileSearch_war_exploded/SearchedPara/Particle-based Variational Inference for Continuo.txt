Methods within this framework can provide:
Guarantees of convergence.
More accurate marginal estimation.
Upper and lower bounds on the partition function.
 (1) Draw weighted particles from each variable's domain. (2) Run importance -reweighted message passing over (3) Use the new messages to adjust the sampling (4) Repeat.
