 Community detection[4,5] and ranking[2] in network are two dominating methods in social network analysis. However, both have their own defects[1]. 
We define X to be the artifact set,  X  to be one artifact, and Y to be the user set, to be one user, and  X   X  to be the  X   X  X  X  community. Each artifact belongs to one commu-nity (because for example, in microblog, one blog tends to focus only one topic). Each user could belong to multiple communities (user may have many interests). 
RankClus[1] combines clustering and ranking together in undirected heterogeneous network. However, its time complexity is high. It distributes users into all communi-ties, which is unreasonable according to the truth. connect two seemingly unrelated variables: artifacts and communities. the distribution is random). Community-based ranking then carry out in every communi-ty. With the ranking score of nodes, we use link transfer model to evaluate the correlation into the most similar communities. Every loop the communities will be adjusted and the reach a specified number or clusters changes only by a very small ratio, the iteration will terminate. Then, we get the meaningful communities. 
Community-based ranking gives members in the same community a discriminating method can be formulated as Where  X  is damping factor to make all the nodes in network can be accessed. And N is the number of nodes in community  X   X  .

Where  X  X  X   X   X   X  is the users directed to artifact community-based ranking score of user  X  . Since every artifact only has relation with one community, but the associated users of it could be in different communities. composed vector. Every community could be formed as the normalized sum of all artifacts in it. Let  X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X   X   X  |  X   X   X   X   X ,  X   X  |  X   X  , the vector of a community  X   X   X   X  X  X  X 1,2,...,  X  X  is cording the cosine similarity scores. 
When new artifact needs to be assigned to one community, there will be three con-siderations: 1) The artifact point to another one. We can directly assign it to the com-munity where the pointed artifact is. 2) The associated users are partly in the user set by equation (2). The iteration goes on as our algorithm described. 3) There X  X  no asso-ciated user in the user set Y. A new community should be created. We use Twitter (http://arnetminer.org/heterinf) and Weibo datasets. The baselines are BigClam[4], Coda[5] and RankClus[1] respectively. BigClam runs on undirected networks while Coda directed. Both are overlapping community detection methods in homogeneous network. RankClus[1] works in undirected heterogeneous network.

Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is an information-theoretic measure of si-milarity between two partitioning of a set of elements[3]. Fig. 1 (a) is the comparison of running time between RankClus and OcdRank. 
We use Weibo dataset with different ground truth of different number of communi-ties. For BigClam and Coda, we treat the heterogeneous networks as homogeneous. algorithm 10 times and get mean value. The result is shown in Fig. 1(b). ranking scores are usually the official accounts in same special field. OcdRank works on directed bi-type heterogeneous social networks.
