 1. Introduction information concerning our daily life. That information collected in mobile devices triggered in-depth investigation on Toivonen, 2005 ; Nokia LifeBlog, http://www.nokia.com/lifeblog ).

Many researchers on context awareness especially focused on the inference of user X  X  hidden information which cannot be on context awareness. The lack of indoor-location information prevents the accurate inference of hidden information be-linked to a user X  X  context.
  X  stays in a restaurant. However, GPS devices cannot provide those valuable evidences.

In order to overcome this drawback of traditional context awareness using GPS, this paper proposes a simple, yet pow-infer user X  X  context by adopting the Bayesian network and proposed indoor localization technique together. 2. Related works
There are many works on the life log and context awareness. In this section, we describe them briefly by dividing them into two groups: information collection and management, and inference of hidden information (see Table 1 ). 2.1. Information collection and management in a cellular phone, but also in a small computer. The ContextPhone provides a software platform which was developed for the smartphone to manage user context more efficiently. The software platform especially helps develop user-context-related applications on mobile phones more easily.

MyLifeBits is a Microsoft research project on the management of everyday information. Contemporary people live in ava-proposed an idea to manage information efficiently by providing quick search, annotation clustering and so on.
There is another work which yokes SenseCam and MyLifeBits together. The work manipulates everyday information by the information collected by the SenseCam is applied to MyLifeBits to manage user X  X  daily life efficiently. 2.2. Inference of hidden information
Beyond the simple organization and manipulation of everyday information, other works focused on the inference by using user X  X  unknown information. Whereabouts Diary uses information such as time, location and web-retrieved informa-ingful semantic labels of the places (e.g., home, bar, workplace and school) by using GPS information, web-service, the behavioral pattern of users and Bayesian networks.

Hwang proposed an idea to infer memory landmarks ( Hwang &amp; Cho, 2006 ). The research deals with a method to infer semantic information and memory landmarks, which cannot be obtained from a mobile device directly, by using a modular
Bayesian networks. 3. The proposed system
In this section, we describe the logical structure of the proposed system (see Fig. 1 ). The system works through five phases: collection, data manipulation, localization, inference and visualization. 3.1. Collection phase
Data stored in a mobile device can be categorized into one of two types: automatically-generated information and infor-mation stored directly by a user. Mobile devices generate data to manage its system or to provide a user with additional information (e.g., number of phone numbers, number of SMS sent in a month, and so on).

On the other hand, information can be stored into a mobile device by direct input from a user. For example, a user tion phase, the system collects all kinds of information stored in a mobile device for the inference, localization and visualization. 3.2. Data-manipulation phase
This phase plays a role in converting raw data, which is collected in the first phase, into available formatted data and can be used in the system. Consider GPS data that is usually stored in the format of NMEA (National Marine Electronics
Association). The system needs to convert time data in NMEA format, standard time, into local time. In addition, some pieces of raw data are useless for the system (e.g., delimiter, checksum data and satellite data). Therefore, the system needs additional processes such as the removal of useless part of data and the transformation of raw data to the avail-able data.
 3.3. Localization phase insufficient for the inference, so we focus on the indoor localization.
 of the following reasons: (1) Existing indoor localization techniques focus on information concerning the point or movement of an object. However, (2) Decision tree can cover a large area if signals for WLAN (Wireless LAN) are available.
The localization phase is divided into two steps: tree building and localization. 3.3.1. Tree building
Before detecting the location of a user, decision tree has to be built. There are several steps to build decision trees: (1) The first step is to define the entire area where the context awareness is performed (e.g., a campus, a town or a 3.3.2. Localization disconnection from satellites for minutes or hours, we can recognize whether a user stays in a building. (1) SSIDs and SSs, which are collected by WLAN, form a stream denoted by Set. (2) The set, denoted by Set. result , storing the results of localization by using each pair of SS and SSID in a Set
Given the accuracy (10 X 30 m) and the refresh time of a normal civil GPS device, the proposed method for detecting the using WiFi network signals. 3.4. Inference phase In the inference phase, the system infers user-hidden information by using the Bayesian network ( Coppola et al., 2005; age serves as one of the evidences to infer his/her job.

Each node can be categorized into one of three types: cause, intermediate and consequence: A cause node plays a role in in the earlier phase. Cause nodes are described in Table 3 . The intermediate node can be used as an evidence to infer unknown information, or contains inferred information. For example, activities described in Table 4 can be used as an location and so on. Finally, consequence node is not used as an evidence for other nodes, but only contains information which is inferred from basic or intermediate evidences (see Table 5 ). Our implementation of the Bayesian network cannot 3.5. Visualization phase
The last phase is the visualization by using applications. We develop two applications to manage personal information such as visited places and building, photos, memos and so on. In addition, programs deal with unknown information, emo-tions and state which are inferred by Bayesian networks.
 of a user at the time shown in current X  X ime window, whereas gray icons represent the trace of the user before that time.
User-state window shows state, location and other personal information. In the indoor-location section, the information taken at the time shown in current X  X ime window. Also, this section shows messages which are written by the user at that time.

The other program is the automatically-generated blog. It is made based on information which is stored in a mobile de-on. The automatically-generated blog service creates a blog chronologically based on this information. 4. Experiments
Three experiments are conducted to verify the performance and the usability of the system we develop: The performance usability.

Experiments were carried out on the laptop with Intel  X  PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network connection and Marvell Yukon room and so one (see Table 6 ).
 4.1. Performance of the decision tree 100 transactions, which have 100 pairs of SSID and SS, are used to make a decision tree by applying them to WEKA. After trates the accuracy of inference based on SSID and SS for each area. The graph shows the accuracy of 91.64%, 97.12% and
Some na X ve implementation of rule-based systems did not give us the accuracy of more than 90%. By adjusting the appro-priate slide size, we could get acceptable performance with the decision tree. 4.2. Performance of the Bayesian network Other activity is a state other than aforementioned activities.
 The experiment is conducted using transactions, each of which has four evidences: day, time, staying time and location.
Transactions include all possible combination of evidences, which is {week, weekend} { x (hour)|1 each activity should be made within 2 h when we collected the data. However, this assumption is not critical and can be can use the proposed Bayesian network for the four activities.
 network. As can be seen, most of the activities were recognized correctly. 4.3. System usefulness test will need more varieties of subjects, e.g. computer literacy, age, work type, etc.

For those who are not familiar with the SUS, we categorize the responses of the survey into two parts: positive response the proposed system.
 5. Concluding remarks paper proposes a new indoor localization technique specific to context awareness.

In addition, we develop a system to infer user X  X  hidden information by using the indoor localization and other everyday effectively.

Recently more useful information became available because versatile smartphones prevailed. Though indoor-location information helps infer user X  X  hidden information, further research needs to focus on the manipulation of other valuable information stored in diverse mobile devices to better recognize user contexts.
