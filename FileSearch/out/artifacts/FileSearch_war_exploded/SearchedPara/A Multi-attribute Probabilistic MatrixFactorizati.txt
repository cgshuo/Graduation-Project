  X  We evaluate our approach SCT-PMF on two real-world data sets. The results 2.1 Problem Definition Assuming an interest-based social network is modelled as a graph G = while, we define adocument D j =(w j 1 , w j 2 , ..., w j N w ) that contains the bag-of-words including the title, keywords, abstract and tags of the product as the of item j .
 ence the social networks have on recommending. We define Jaccard similarity [ 1 ] between users to measure the common interest relationship (to grant the social matrix S ). In order to define our model more realistically, we consider each user X  X  particular taste in the context of her/his social relationship network in our model. The interest-based social relationship of u  X  i is defined by Equation (1). 1  X   X  represent the weight of u i particular interests and his interests influenced 2.2 SCT-PMF This paper exploits the LDA and PMF to incorporate the content information of items and users X  social relationships, called SCT-PMF model, to enhance recom-mendation X  X  predictive accuracy. The new model offers a probabilistic foundation in dealing with different factors, which gives rise to much flexibility for modelling various real recommendation situations. The graphical model of SCT-PMF is shown in Fig.1.
 More specifically, we draw topic proportions  X  j  X  Dirichlet (  X  ) and item latent Each word w jl draws topic assignment z jl  X  Mult (  X  ) and word assignment w jl  X  Mult (  X  zjl ) in item j (document).
 content information of items, we could obtain the following Equation (2). 3.2 Experimental Results and Discussion In order to make the experiments comparable, the same configuration applies to the proposed model and the baselines as well.
 Performance Comparison. In order to show the effectiveness of our method, which displays the superior performance than other three baseline models, we present the performance results with well tuned parameter H and fixed other parameter with  X  U =0 . 01 , X  V =0 . 1 , X  =0 . 05 in Bibsonomy data set and  X  U = 0 . 01 , X  V =10 , X  =0 . 2 in CiteUlike data set, respectively. And our approach (SCT-PMF) outperforms other methods (PMF, LDA and CTR) no matter how the tuned parameter H is changing. It illustrates that the proposed model is scalable.
 Impact of Social Relationship. To testify the influence of social relation-ships in the recommendation system, let  X  U =0 . 01 , X  V =0 . 1 ,H = 200 in the Bibsonomy data set and  X  U =0 . 01 , X  V =10 ,H = 200 in the CiteUlike data set, respectively. We then observe the effect of varying parameter  X  . As a result, social relationships have a great influence on recommending items to users from our experiments.
 Impact of Content Information. In order to explain how the value of  X  V affects the performance, we hold other variables constant as  X  U =0 . 01 , X  = 0 . 05 ,H = 200 in Bibsonomy and  X  U =0 . 01 , X  =0 . 2 ,H = 200 in CiteUlike, respectively. In short, the content of items strongly influence the performance of recommendation in an aspect of our experiments. In this paper, we proposed an extended probabilistic matrix factorization model incorporating social relationships and elaborated content-based information to enhance the recommendation performance. The experimental results show that our approach has achieved a great improvement on predictive accuracy of book recommendation. In the paper, users X  social relationships are considered, but no further actions regarding information diffusion or propagation between users are counted. Furthermore, social relationships may include trust or distrust infor-mation, which are worthy of future study.
