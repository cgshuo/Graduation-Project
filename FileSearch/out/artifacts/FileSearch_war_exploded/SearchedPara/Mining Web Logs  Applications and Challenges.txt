 Web logs record the primary interaction of users with web pages in general and search engines in particular. There are two sources for such logs: user trails obtained from toolbars and query/click information obtained from search engines. In this talk we will address the task of mining this rich data to improve user experience on the web. We will illustrate a few applications, together with the modeling and algorith-mic challenges that stem from these applications. We will also discuss the privacy issues that arise in this context.

Prior to this, he was a research staff member at the IBM Almaden Research Center in the Computer Science Principles and Methodologies group. His primary interests are web algo-rithms, algorithms for large data sets, and theory of com-putation. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University in December 1997.
