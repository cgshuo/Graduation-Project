 The emergence of the Internet and e-commerce requires that corporations and governments provide partners, clients and users with easy access to their systems, applications and services. As the result, the management of user identity information in a secure and effective way has become more important and increasingly critical in the successful deployment and provision of web-based applications and services. Identity management not only can help to centralize and simplify the management of user identities and support secure and convenient access to web-based applications and services that require user identification and authentication, it can also help to ensure user privacy by acting on the user X  X  behalf as well as by enforcing applicable laws and policies. Therefore, identity management has received a great deal of attention in the network research community and, as the result, a lot of progress has been made in recent years. can find approaches that aim at unifying a diverse set of user identities assigned to and accumulated by an individual user. One example is that an employee in a large organization may have established multiple identities for different computer and network systems following different requirements and guidelines. Another example is that a web user on the Internet may have registered with different web-based applications and services using the same or different identities as requested following unify the many different identities to provide convenience to the user and to improve security that may deteriorate as the number of identities increases. user privacy and at reducing the potential risk of exposing user or communication profiles to unauthorized parties [6]. Although current approaches that try to unify user identities may help to ease some of the concerns, they have severe limitations. One such a limitation is that these approaches work only in a so-called federated network environment in which member users, systems, applications and services yield the management of identities to a central authority. In the open Internet environment, however, it is generally very hard to establish a large-scale federated network because different businesses have different needs and different value propositions on their clients and customers, which requires that businesses manage their own users and user identities. This probably explains why popular single-sign-on (SSO) services such as Microsoft .NET Passport could not continue its rapid expansion after reaching certain scale in corporate membership. Liability on user privacy concerns and user ownership has also played some role in slowing down the adoption of SSO services in the open Internet environment. In general, identity management encompasses definitions and lifecycle management of user identities and associated profile information, as well as the environment for exchanging and validating such information [4]. Identity management is essential for building and maintaining trust relationships in different interconnected systems. related work. In Section 3, we analyze the network environment and discuss several key requirements for distributed management of identities in such an environment. In Section 4, we present our framework for distributed management of identities and discuss some of the related issues. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 5. Managing multiple versions of user identities in a network environment is crucial for the development of the next generation of distributed applications and services. Most of the work in identity management, therefore, has focused on providing solutions and mechanisms that can help users to create and maintain multiple identities easily. One approach to address this issue is to establish a network-wide standard for the management of multiple identities to ensure the interoperability among different identity management systems. At present, the two popular identity management standards are the Microsoft .NET Passport (www.passport.com) and the Liberty Alliance X  X  open standards for federated network identity [9]. Microsoft .NET Passport consists of a set of web-based service components, provides the single-sign-on (SSO) capability for users, and makes use of encryption technologies such as SSL (i.e., avoid remembering multiple sets of user names and passwords. Users can also use many forms of devices to check and update their profiles associated with their identities, such as PCs and hand-held devices. For a business, Microsoft .NET Passport provides a high-visibility marketing image and trust relationship in the maintenance of user identities. In addition, Microsoft .NET Passport provides a single identity to each user for access to multiple web-based applications and services. Therefore, companies can use this single iden tity to create a database of user profiles. Similarly, Liberty Alliance has been engaged in developing a set of open standards for federated networks in which identities can be managed collaboratively by member companies [5]. The Alliance currently has over 40 member companies who have been working together to realize the following goals: z To allow individual consumers and businesses to maintain personal information z To provide a universal open standard for single-sign-on (SSO) services. z To provide a universal open standard for identities to span across all network managing multiple identities has focused primarily on providing the SSO capability and, therefore, suffers certain limitations [8]. First, SSO is suitable only for a federated network environment in which all member users, systems and applications and services trust a central authority to manage identities and to provide authentication services on their behalf. This is not generally practical in the open Internet in which majority of web sites and applications prefer to remain independent and maintain their own user identities and profiles for flexibility and diversity. Second, there are many other equally important issues besides SSO that an identity management system should address, such as how to help users to ensure privacy and to control the sharing and exposing sensitive user information. Convenience that SSO can provide should by no means sacrifice the capability and flexibility for ensuring user privacy as well as that for businesses to safeguard the most valuable information they possess for their businesses. major issues and discussed an approach to controlling multiple identities in an electronic world. However, the work lacks many specific details for establishing a framework for the development of an identity management system. Pfitzmann, et al, [11] examined a flaw discovered in the Liberty Alliance protocol and discussed the general nature of third party authentication methods. As pointed out earlier, SSO is the main focus of the Liberty Alliance effort and, therefore, other major issues related to identity management still remain unaddressed in this work. Finally, the trust negotiation framework proposed in [12] relies on a state-based language for trust management that offers a potential solution for trust negotiation in changing environments but, unfortunately, only addressed some of the issues in identity management. identities as well as the limitations of the current work, we will proposes a framework for distributed management of identities in this paper to meet the requirements and objectives of identity management in an open network environment. Another objective of this framework is to achieve broad interoperability and dynamic scalability among identity management systems. A network identity is a user identity that can be used to uniquely identify and subsequently authenticate the user in a ne twork environment, especially over the Internet, to provide the user with access to web-based applications and services. In general, any solution for identity management should meet the following three requirements: z Convenience Convenience implies support and services that should at least be equivalent to what the current SSO can offer to the user. In a federated environment in which a central authority takes the full responsibility of managing user identities and making authentication decisions, convenience is straightforward. However, a federated architecture is generally suitable only for a single organization or a group of organizations that have very close business relationships. Therefore, it is not generally a practical solution on the Internet. To a large number of unrelated businesses and organizations, forming a federation and becoming members in it presents a great deal of difficulty because the federated architecture would take away from the members the ability of directly managing the most important and valuable information for their businesses, i.e., user identities and associated user profiles. Such architecture also requires that all authentication decisions be made by the central authority, which implies that the central authority has to take a full responsibility in the event of security breaches and that members have to have a full trust on the central authority, both of which are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Therefore, achieving convenience without requiring dramatic changes to current business practices is a very important consideration in our framework for distributed identity management. z Controlled information disclosure Without a central authority to manage user identities and associated information, the sharing of identities and information among web-based applications and services becomes necessary to meet the requirement for convenience. However, sharing of user identity information without the knowledge and control of the user could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, harming the concerned user. For well-behaved businesses, sharing of user identity information should not be allowed without explicit authorization by the concerned user. For less-well-behaved businesses, the lack of explicit user authorization and control provides the possibility to abuse the acquired user identity inform ation to gain unfair business advantages. information is essential in our framework for distributed identity management. z Confidentiality and privacy Safeguarding user identity information and ensuring user privacy is something that could go beyond what the user can imagine and control. Although the ability of controlling information disclosure provides the user with the necessary means of protecting information and ensuring privacy, there are often times when the user may misjudge the situation or be misled to act in a way that may violate the general policy for protecting user privacy. Furthermore, although authentication decisions based on user identities and associated profiles can provide convenience while preserving user and services. Instead, national legislations and policies are being established gradually Internet. Such legislations and policies established by and for businesses should be an integral part of a solution for the management of identities in a network environment. Our objectives for proposing a framework in this paper are to define the relationships between the various network entities and their identities and to identify necessary means and mechanisms for distributed management of these identities that can meet the three general requirements that we just described. We assume, in our framework, that a user has already established one or more identities with different applications and services in a network environment. A user registration process required by the appli cation or service. The user could also establish a network identity with an application or service through employment. In a word, a network identity is a name that relates a user to a network application or service and is a unique way of presenting th e user to the application or service. A network identity of a user is also an abstr action of all the information about the user that the application or service desires to know and is used to uniquely identify the user within the domain of the application or service. Therefore, a user could use the same name as the network identities with different applications and services as long as the name is unique within each individual application or service. management of network identities. Users: A user is an active entity that seeks to use a network service offered through a web-based application to accomplish a set of functions advertised by the application. Application or service (AS): An application or service is the representation of a set of functions that are considered to be valu able to some users and can be activated for the users. Network identity (NID): A network identity is a name that can uniquely identify a know about the user. Most important among all the information in a network identity is a secret code or password that is shared by the user and the AS and is used by the AS to authenticate the user in order to relate the user to a subset of the functions that the AS offers. Thus, an NID determines how much of the AS can be used by the user and, therefore, forms a relationship between the user and the AS. using NIDs to define the relationships. Note that each AS may choose to offer a the AS and, therefore, is not a consideration in the framework. management of NIDs becomes the issue of managing such relationships, which includes establishing and maintaining such relationships, to meet the requirements and objectives we set in this paper. Therefore, mechanisms and management functions are required between the users and the ASs to manage the NID relationships and to realize the management functions on the network identities. component NIDM. Note, however, that the NIDM component is just for the management of NIDs in the framework and doesn X  X  imply that the NIDM can only be implemented as a centralized management module. Rather, the NIDM component should be viewed as a set of middleware management functions, some of which are middleware network functions or services. Furthermore, a particular function can be supported in more than one form and different forms of support may be used to manage different NIDs according to user requests as well as specific network environments. Therefore, the framework for distributed management of network identities is a very general statement about how network identities can be managed distributed concept in which different NIDs can be managed in different ways. As an example, Microsoft .NET Passport is an independent network service that can be used for managing the NIDs for a group of applications and services. However, this group is still relatively small and users can choose not to use Microsoft .NET Passport to access some of the applications and services in this group but rather to manage the NIDs in different manners. Furthermore, as pointed out earlier, a management scheme like Microsoft .NET Passport requires a federated architecture in which all the ASs delegate NID management as well as the subsequent user authentication functions to an independent component, which may not be very consistent with business practices and goals. Therefore, it could be very difficult to make such a generic middleware network service appealing to a majority of network applications and services. Therefore, different ways of NID management must be supported to suit the needs and requirements of different network ASs. distributed management of network identities in which we also identify some of the essential functions that are required to achieve our objectives. z Convenience Convenience, in the most straightforward way, means that a user, when dealing with multiple ASs, doesn X  X  have to enter the same user information, including critical network identity information, repeatedly unless the user chooses to do so. Therefore, convenience requires that mechanisms be developed for the following two scenarios. management module is present to aid the user in managing NIDs and to perform user authentication on behalf of the ASs that are members of the federation. Microsoft .NET Passport is one of the most popular central NID management solutions that serve member ASs in a federated environment. With such a solution, after a user is registered with Microsoft .NET Passport, the user needs only identity and authenticate with Microsoft .NET Passport once before accessing the ASs that belong to the Microsoft .NET Passport federation. However, as pointed out earlier, it would be very hard to imagine that a single federation could ever be formed for all ASs over the Internet. Actually, having a single or a few numbers of federations of ASs for the entire Internet is contradictory to the basic design principles of the Internet in which distributed control and management ought to take the central role. Therefore, in the second scenario, we consider a truly distributed environment in which there is no central NID management module but mechanisms still need to be developed to provide convenience for the users to manage multiple NIDs. Fig. 4 illustrates the two NID management scenarios that we must consider in dealing with the issue of convenience. It is especially true that, due to the lack of a central management module for the distributed management, some different mechanisms must be developed to make it effective and convenient for the users to interact with multiple ASs using NIDs. In the distributed scenario, we assume that the user has already established an NID NID with the AS and to provide user information requested by the AS. Convenience becomes the central issue when this user needs to establish a relationship with another AS in which most, if not all, essential information about the user is primarily the same. Fig. 5 illustrates this situation in which the user has already established an NID with AS 1 and now desires to establish an NID with AS 2 . There are at least two methods in which convenience can be realized in this case. The first method requires that a protocol be developed in which the user, after successful identification and establish an NID with AS 2 . The second method requires that a protocol be developed in which the user, after successful identification and authentication with AS 1 , requests second method, the user is in effect using AS 1 as a proxy for identification and authentication to AS 2 and, hence, AS 2 will not have an independent NID with the user. Fig. 6 illustrates the two methods, both of which can provide convenience to the user in managing multiple NIDs. Note that the second method may appear to resemble the scheme used for the federated scenario in which AS 1 is the central management module. However, there are some fundamental differences because the second method performs NID management for the user. Rather, AS 1 is just acting in response to user request in this particular instance. The user may request different ASs with which the user has already established NIDs to perform such identification and authentication functions on its behalf at different instances when interacting with a new AS such as AS 2 in Fig. 6. This is useful because the user may wish to obtain different services at different times from AS 2 by using different NIDs. This also allows the user to maintain desired privacy by using different NIDs when interacting with AS 2 because the different NIDs used gives AS 2 different views about the user. z Controlled information disclosure It is obvious that the way in which conve nience is achieved in the framework also provides the necessary support for the user to control the disclosure of identity information to a new AS. If the identity information is sent from a present AS to the new AS through the user (i.e., in the first method), for controlled information disclosure, some mechanism must be developed so that the user can examine, edit information is sent to the new AS. If the identity information is passed directly from the present AS to the new AS (i.e., in the second method), some mechanism must also be developed so that the user can specify the class of information that can be sent by convenience in our framework also provide the necessary foundation for realizing controlled information disclosure. What we need are the actual mechanisms described above and their implementations to allow the user to exercise the control, which is our current research effort. z Confidentiality and privacy With controlled information disclosure, confidentiality and privacy become possible provided that necessary mechanisms be developed to support such functions. For example, to achieve confidentiality, encryption techniques must be employed for data exchanges among the user, the present AS and the new AS using a widely available key distribution scheme such as PKI. The user can also ensure privacy by selectively passing identity information to the new AS with necessary support mechanisms. purpose of ensuring user privacy, that is, the mandatory and legal aspect of privacy. This is important because an ordinary user often lacks the necessary knowledge about how to effectively protect his/her privacy in the real world. Moreover, business vendors that offer legitimate ASs often tend to request the user to send more personal information than what is necessary for undisclosed business purposes. To gain access to a desired AS, the user usually satisfies the request, which consequently could result in compromises to user privacy. Therefore, we include an element that embodies national legislation or policy for the protection of user privacy over the Internet in our framework and expect with full confidence that such legislation or policy will be fully developed in which businesses will be classified based on the nature and type of ASs they offer and privacy statements will be in place to clearly define what kind of user information can be collected by the businesses. This mandatory privacy policy will offer the badly needed help in eventually achieving the goals of ensuring user privacy. In anticipation of the arrival of such mandatory policy in the future, we incorporate such considerations and the necessary mechanisms in our framework. As the result, we not only have the discretionary control by the user but also have the mandatory control based on legislation or policy over the disclosure of user identity information to a new AS. Fig. 7 illustrates such privacy considerations and the mechanisms that can help to achieve the privacy goals. Note that the privacy enforcement module will take, in addition to the privacy legislation or policy statements, some information about the new AS such as the nature or type of the business or the new AS to apply the policy statements and derive the necessary information to be forwarded to the new AS. Such information can be obtained through a protocol that needs to be developed and must be certified to prevent the new AS from providing inaccurate or even false mechanisms for obtaining the AS information and for enforcing user privacy accordingly are being developed as a part of the current research effort. We presented a framework for distributed management of network identities to meet the three requirements we iden tified, namely, convenience, controlled information disclosure and confidentiality and privacy, without the necessary requirement for establishing a federation. We showed that the assumptions that we made for establishing the framework are more realistic in today X  X  Internet environment and the framework can suit any businesses and organizations that have a web presence and provide applications and services that rely on user identity information for authentication and access control and for service differentiation and management. The major contribution of the framework is to define and provide the necessary means for the users to control the disclosure of sensitive identity information to protect information confidentiality and to ensure user privacy. Therefore, the framework addresses both the needs of businesses and organizations and those of the users in today X  X  complex network environment and, thus, can be used as the foundation for the development of the next generation of identity management systems beyond the so-called single-sign-on offered in today X  X  identity management solutions and services. technical problems to solve before seamless distributed network identity management can become a reality. Chief among them are the methods and mechanisms that we identified and briefly described in this paper that implement and support convenience, controlled information disclosure and confidentiality and privacy which are our current focus in the research on distributed identity management.
