 Critique-based conversational recommender systems are be-coming common place, facilitating richer dialogues with the user than pure content-based or collaborative approaches. Most implementations of these systems combine similarity-based reasoning with constraints to enable users express preferences as critiques of products. Critiques are simple statements like  X  X  like this product, but would prefer one that is less expensive X  . In this paper we exploit the fact that the repertoire of critiques available to the user is usu-ally known ahead of interaction time to construct a critique graph representation of a catalogue. The critique graph pro-vides a formal basis for reasoning about the set of products that can be reached using critiques from a given product. We introduce the concepts of product cover , support sets of products and catalogue cover . The latter is defined as a set of products from which all products in a catalogue can be reached using a specified best-case maximum number of critiques. We show that for the catalogues we considered, catalogue covers are typically small. We show that the sizes and distributions of product covers and support sets can be used to inform us of the structure of a catalogue and the challenges it would present for interactive navigation. We also propose the notion of a minimum catalogue cover as a set of  X  X ntry products X  that ensure that all products in the catalogue can be reached by critiquing.

 Algorithms Recommender Systems
Humans often make decisions based on large amounts of data stored in catalogues. For example, we typically de-cide what books to buy, what movies to see, what holi-days to take, with only limited knowledge of the available choices [1]. Recommender systems and intelligent interac-tive search tools are important in helping users make such decisions.

Recently, a considerable amount of research interest has developed around the notion of critique-based recommender systems [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14]. In critique-based rec-ommenders users articulate their desires by reacting to a product recommendation by describing what should change before the suggested product is deemed satisfactory. For example, presented with a particular product, a user might critique using simple statements like  X  X  would prefer a prod-uct like this but less expensive X  . The semantics associated with these statements is typically to seek a product that is most similar to the recommended product being critiqued, but satisfying the constraint specified in the critique. Such an interactive search model is very attractive because it as-sumes very little about the user. In addition, the user is not expected to specify a utility function before interaction begins, but his preferences are  X  X evealed X  during the inter-action. However, a fundamental question is which products should be presented to the user first.

In this paper we introduce a formal approach to study-ing the behaviour of critique-based recommender systems from the best-case point of view. Our approach is based on a directed critique multigraph , which makes explicit all possible ways of navigating through a product catalogue us-ing critiquing and similarity-based reasoning. In this pa-per we study an abstraction of the directed critique multi-graph called a directed critique graph that encodes critique distances between products, i.e. the minimum number of products the user will need to critique, making one critique at a time, to navigate from a given product to another given product. The critique graph provides a formal basis for rea-soning about the set of products that can be reached using critiques, as well as the number of ways a product can be reached. An interesting aspect of the standard semantics of critiquing is that it is not symmetric: the critique distance between a pair of products may not be the same in each direction because of the effect of similarity. We introduce the formal notions of product cover , support sets of products and catalogue cover . The latter we define as a set of prod-ucts from which all products in a catalogue can be reached using a specified best-case maximum number of critiques. We show how these can inform our understanding of the structure of a product catalogue and the challenges it would pose for interactive navigation. We also propose the notion of a minimum catalogue cover as an initial set of products to present to a user in order to ensure that all products in the catalogue can be reached by critiques. Therefore, the minimum catalogue cover provides a formal, well-founded definition for a good set of  X  X ntry-point X  products [3].
This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we present some preliminaries on critiquing in a case-based reasoning approach to catalogue navigation. We introduce the notion of critique (multi-)graphs and show their basic properties in Section 3. Based on critique graphs, in Section 4 we introduce product covers, support sets and catalogue covers as useful concepts for analyzing catalogue search systems as well as deciding which products should be presented on screen for the user as entry points. An indepth empirical study is reported in Section 5. Concluding remarks and an outline of our future research agenda are presented in Section 6.
A catalogue defines a set of products,  X . Each prod-uct p i  X   X  is defined by a tuple of n attributes A =  X  a 1 ,...,a n  X  . For the sake of clarity we will employ a run-ning example throughout the paper to explain each of the formal concepts. In Table 1 we present an example cata-logue of houses (from [10]). In this example there are five attributes A = { Loc,Beds,Type,RRs } , representing loca-tion, number of bedrooms, type and number of reception rooms, respectively.

We assume a simple distance metric, d ( p i ,p j ), between products is defined, which enables us to reason about inexact matches between products and user-stated queries for ideal products. We assume that this distance measure satisfies the standard properties of a metric: 1. Non-negativity: d ( x,y )  X  0; 2. Identity of indiscernibles: d ( x,y ) = 0 iff x = y ; 3. Symmetry: d ( x,y ) = d ( y,x ); 4. Subadditivity: d ( x,y ) + d ( y,z )  X  d ( x,z ). We also assume the distance metric is a weighted sum that is decomposed across the attributes of the product. Specifi-cally, given a pair of products p i and p j  X   X , we define the distance between them as: where d a k is a measure of distance on the a k -th attribute of the catalogue, and the notation p i [ a k ] refers to the value of attribute a k of product p i . The quantity w k is the (non-negative) weight of attribute a k . We assume distances and weights to be in [0 , 1], so the maximum distance between products is in [0 ,n ].

We define the similarity between two products in an anal-ogous manner, as the complement of distance. Specifically, we define the similarity  X  ( p i ,p j ) as: Note that  X  ( p i ,p j ) also inherits the properties of a metric.
In Table 2 we show the similarities between every pair of products, based on Hamming distance being the measure of distance between products, and all attributes have unit weight. In this case the similarity between products is the number of attributes that are the same.

Table 2: Similarities between products in Table 1.
In many applications of recommender systems, the inter-action is based on an iterative process during which the sys-tem proposes one or more products, and the user provides feedback about his preferences through critiques . For exam-ple, given a recommendation of a restaurant, a user might critique it by indicating that he would prefer an alternative that is like this but less expensive . The two most common forms of critique are directional and replacement [2]. Direc-tional critiques specify either an increase or decrease in the value of attributes that are either numerical or naturally ordered; a typical directional critique affects an attribute such as price, size, weight, etc. Replacement critiques, on the other hand, specify an alternative value for an attribute taking its values from a finite set; a typical replacement cri-tique would affect a location, a colour, a brand, etc.
Given a product p i and one of its attributes a k , we can identify all possible critiques available on that attribute. Di-rectional critiques allow two possibilities: more is better, or less is better. Replacement critiques allow for the substi-tution of all possible values for attribute a k other than its current value in p i , namely p i [ a k ].

The formal semantics of critiquing that we use in this pa-per is given a product p i and a critique on attribute a k system responds with a product p j that is most similar to p , but satisfies the critique on attribute a k . For example, given a recommendation of a restaurant and a like this but cheaper critique, we seek an alternative product that has a lower cost, but is otherwise most similar to the original rec-ommendation. The notion of the set of all possible critiques on an attribute generalizes to all possible critiques over all product attributes, which we will use in the next section to define our core notion of a critique graph.

This approach treats individual critiques independently of any previous critiques a user might have made. However, some approaches consider sequences of critiques as conjunc-tions of constraints. e.g. [10]. It is possible to also use these richer semantics of critiques here.
Given a product catalogue and similarity measures for each attribute, it is possible to pre-compute all possible ways in which the user can critique any product that might be rec-ommended to him. In this section we propose the notion of a critique multigraph that encodes which specific critiques en-able one to move from product to product in the catalogue. This critique multigraph can be abstracted to give a cri-tique graph. Based on this graph, we can compute a variety of interesting statistics that provide insights into the char-acteristics associated with navigating a particular catalogue and, in particular, the asymmetry inherent in critique-based catalogue navigation.

A multigraph is a graph in which multiple edges between vertices are allowed. For our purposes we consider the case of directed multigraphs.

Definition 1. A critique multigraph , C m ( X ), that is asso-ciated with a catalogue of products  X , is a directed multi-graph G = def ( V,E ). For each product p  X   X  we have an associated vertex v  X  V . Each directed edge ( v i ,v is associated with a critique of product p i whose most simi-lar product satisfying the critique includes product p j ; each edge is labeled with the critique to which it corresponds.
Critique multigraphs become very large for even modest sized catalogues. A (small) portion of the multigraph for our example catalogue (Table 1) is presented in Figure 1. This multigraph encodes the fact that if one critiques product p by requesting fewer rooms than the 4 associated with this product, one of the most similar products satisfying this cri-tique is p 1 . If there are multiple products that have equally high similarity satisfying the critique, the multigraph will contain edges to those products. For example, in Figure 1 critiquing p 5 requesting fewer than 4 rooms also leads to p Figure 1: Part of the critique directed multigraph for our example catalogue. The products p 1 ,...,p 5 are represented by the vertices labeled 1 ,..., 5 .
It is convenient to abstract the critique multigraph to a directed critique graph in which all edges between a pair of vertices are reduced to a single edge with the appropriate direction. A directed edge ( v i ,v j ) in a critique graph can be interpreted as stating that there exists a critique of product p that leads to product p j , however which attribute is being critiqued is not represented at this level; this is only made explicit in the critique multigraph. For this paper we will focus on the properties of the critique graph only.
Definition 2. A critique graph , C ( X ) of a critique multi-graph is a directed graph on the same set of vertices as its corresponding multigraph C m ( X ). All directed edges ( v in C m ( X ) form a single directed edge between ( v i ,v j critique graph C ( X ).

The complete critique graph associated with our example catalogue is presented in Figure 2. Note that there is a cen-tral clique of vertices representing products p 1 ,...,p 4 directed edges between all pairs in both directions. However, there are only outgoing edges from p 5 , representing the fact that while there exist critiques of p 5 that lead to every other product, there are no critiques of the other products that lead to p 5 .

This is an example of the asymmetry inherent in the kind of critique-based navigation being considered here. It is important to note that critiques are not necessarily sym-metric. For example, critiquing product p 2 requesting more bedrooms ( Beds &gt; 3), leads to p 3 , and critiquing p questing fewer bedrooms ( Beds &lt; 4) leads back to p 2 . How-ever, this is not generally true. There are often cases where this symmetry is absent due to the effect of similarity. For example, critiquing product p 5 requesting fewer bedrooms ( Beds &lt; 4), leads to p 1 , and critiquing p 1 requesting more bedrooms ( Beds &gt; 3) leads to p 3 . We will revisit this point later in this section.
 Figure 2: The critique digraph for our example cat-alogue. When there is a pair of directed edges be-tween vertices we represent these as a single edge with a double arrow.

Another property of critiquing, when one focuses on cri-tique graphs, is that there are situations where some prod-ucts cannot be reached by any critique sequence from a given product. The notion of reachability between products is an important issue that has been studied in [10]. In Figure 2 product p 5 is not reachable from any other product in the catalogue. This is because starting from another other prod-uct in the catalogue and requesting a most similar product that satisfies a given critique never results in a recommen-dation of p 5 .

Definition 3. Given a catalogue  X , and a pair of products p ,p j  X   X , we say that p j is reachable from p i iff there is path from p i to p j in the critique graph C ( X ).

Theorem 1 (Reachability in Viewpoints). Given a catalogue  X  and a pair of products p i ,p j  X   X  , p j is reachable from p i in C ( X ) , the critique graph of  X  , iff p j is reachable from p i in C m ( X ) , the critique multigraph of  X  .
Proof. Follows immediately from the definitions of cri-tique multigraph and critique graph.
Based on the critique graph, we can define the notion of critique distance between products, as well as the standard similarity metric. If one can critique a product p i and reach product p j we say that the critique distance from p i to p 1. If a product p j cannot be reached from p i we say that the critique distance from p i to p j is  X  . Otherwise, assuming a user provides one critique at a time, the critique distance be-tween a pair of products is the shortest path length between them in the critique graph.

Definition 4. The minimum critique distance between a pair of products p i and p j  X   X , ( . p i ,p j ), is the shortest path between the corresponding vertices v i and v j of the critique graph of the catalogue.

The matrix of minimum critique distances for our example catalogue is presented in Table 3. For a catalogue compris-ing m products, this matrix can be computed using standard algorithms for the All Pairs Shortest Path problem in a di-rected graph. If Floyd X  X  algorithm is used, computing these critique distances can be done in O ( m 3 ) time, where m is the number of products in the catalogue  X .

We can generalize the concept of graph diameter to a no-tion of longest optimal critiquing sequences. The standard definition of graph diameter is that it equals the longest shortest path between any pair of graph vertices. In our case, we will refer to the diameter of a critique graph as the longest shortest path between any two products p i and p j such that p j is reachable from p i . The diameter of a cri-tique graph is an interesting parameter since it defines the worst-case optimal critique-based dialog length, and there-fore defines a formal lower-bound with which alternative ap-proaches to critiquing can be compared.
 Table 3: Critique distances for the example cata-logue in Table 1.

Interestingly, while similarity is usually assumed to be symmetric, when we measure the critique distance between products in terms of critique distance, we no longer can be guaranteed to have such symmetry.
 Theorem 2 (Critique Distance is a Pseudo-Metric).
 Critique distance defines a pseudo-metric over products, even when the underlying similarity measures are symmetric.
Proof. A pseudo-metric satisfies the usual properties of a distance metric, except symmetry. It can be easily shown that non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles and subad-ditivity hold for critique distance. To show that symme-try does not hold, consider the following product vectors in which attributes are represented by the coordinates in the vector, and the possible values of each attribute are 0 and 1. Consider three products x , y and z defined by similarity between products to be the Hamming distance; smaller Hamming distance means more similar. Hamming distance defines a symmetric distance measure. We assume a replacement critique scheme with the following possible critiques: 0  X  1 and 1  X  0.

Consider the following critique sequence: critique  X  0 , 0 , 0 , 0  X  requesting a 1 in the third coordinate gives  X  0 , 0 , 1 , 1  X  , which when critiqued by asking for a 0 in the third coordinate gives  X  0 , 0 , 0 , 1  X  . Clearly symmetry does not hold. Therefore, cri-tique distance is a pseudo-metric.

The lack of symmetry is clearly important in an interac-tive search context: attempting to undo a critique by ap-plying its opposite does not work like a  X  X ack button X  on a web-browser, which might be counterinuitive to the user. A useful application of critique graphs could be to help select an appropriate semantics for critiques for a specific catalogue so that the number of symmetric critiques is maximized.
Based on the critique graph and the notion of critique distance, given a product p i  X   X  we can compute a set of products reachable from it within a given number of cri-tiques,  X  . We refer to this set of products as a  X  -product cover. The worst-case value of  X  is equal to the diameter of the critique graph of  X .

Definition 5. Given a product catalogue  X  and a product p  X   X , a  X  -product cover of p i is a  X   X  p element of  X   X  p i is reachable from p i by following a shortest path of no more than  X  critiques. We define p i to always be an element of its own product covers.

The set of 1-product covers for our example catalogue are presented in Table 4.
 Table 4: The set of 1-product covers for each of the products in our example catalogue in Table 1.

The set of  X  -product covers provide a formal basis for ex-tracting a set of products that guarantee that every product in the catalogue can be reached within a specified number of critiques in the best case. A key notion here is that of the support set of a product.

Definition 6. Given a product catalogue  X  and a product p  X   X , a  X  -support set of p i is  X   X  p product in the catalogue that can reach p i by following a shortest path in the critique graph of  X  involving at most  X  critiques is an element of  X   X  p i . We define p i to always be an element of its own support sets.

The set of 1-support sets for our example catalogue are presented in Table 5. Note that due to reachability, the only product that supports p 5 is itself.

The set of support sets for each product can be used to compute the smallest set of products to be critiqued to guar-antee one can reach every other product in the catalogue. Table 5: The set of 1-support sets for each of the products in our example catalogue in Table 1.
 For example, in Table 5 we can see that product p 5 can be used to reach every product in the catalogue using at most one critique in the best case. We refer to this set of products as a minimum catalogue cover, because it comprises prod-ucts that if critiqued optimally enables us to cover every other product.

Definition 7. Given a product catalogue  X , a  X  -catalogue cover is a subset of  X  such that every product in  X  can be reached by following a shortest path of no more than  X  critiques from an element of the  X  -catalogue cover.
We argue that a  X  -catalogue cover is an ideal set of starting products, or  X  X ntry points X , to present to a user in a critique-based recommender system. Not only does this set cover all products, we will show later that the number of products in this set tends to be very small in practice.

Theorem 3 (Reachability). If a catalogue contains a product that is unreachable by critiquing any of the other products, then the catalogue cover will always contain the unreachable product.

Proof. If a product is unreachable, its support set con-tains itself only. Therefore, it order for this product to be covered, it must be included in the catalogue cover.
While the  X  -catalogue cover has many nice properties, it is intractable to compute and cannot be approximated within a constant factor of minimum size in polynomial time.
Theorem 4 (Complexity). Given a set of  X  -product covers for each product in a catalogue, finding a  X  -catalogue cover of at most K elements is NP-Complete.

Proof. The problem is clearly in NP. Given a  X  -catalogue cover we can check if its cardinality is bounded by K and whether it contains an element of each  X  -product cover in polynomial time: in fact, the time complexity is linear in the size of the catalogue.

We prove completeness using a reduction from the Hit-ting Set problem, which is defined as follows [8]: Given an instance of the Hitting Set problem, ( C,K ), we construct an instance of the  X  -catalogue cover in the fol-lowing immediate way. For each set c i  X  C we create a dummy product p i , and create an associated support set for it equal to c i . The Hitting Set problem answers Yes iff the  X  -catalogue cover contains at most K elements.
The standard approximability results for the Hitting Set problem carry over to the problem of finding a  X  -catalogue cover. In particular, the optimization variant, where we seek a  X  -catalogue cover with the smallest value of K is approx-imable within 1 + ln |  X  | [9]. However, it is not in the complexity class, i.e. the class of NP optimization problems that admit polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithms. While finding the smallest  X  -catalogue cover is intractable, one can easily formulate it as an integer linear program, and find the smallest  X  -catalogue cover using any standard ILP solver, such as cplex . 1 Such a reformulation is often practicable, as we will see in our empirical evalua-tion.
We performed an indepth empirical analysis of four well-known product catalogues that are frequently used in recom-mender system research. These are related to digital cam-eras, laptop computers, property lettings and travel [11].
For the purposes of our evaluation, we adjusted the datasets in the following ways. Firstly, all attributes that were not used in critiquing, e.g. unique identifiers or textual descrip-tions, were removed. Secondly, all declared domain values that did not appear in at least one product, but appeared in the specification, were also removed. If some values ap-peared in datasets but were not declared, we added them to the model specification. A summary of the properties of the instances are reported in Table 6.
 Table 6: Instance properties. Size is the number of products. Cat and Num denote the number of cat-egorical and numerical attributes. D min ,D max and D avg denote the maximal, minimal and average num-ber of attribute values, respectively.

In Table 7 we show the properties of the critique graph generated from each catalogue, with vertex sets V and di-rected edge sets E . Since only a subset of edges have sym-metric counterparts we report the number of these in the E sym column. It is interesting to note that only a relatively small proportion of edges are symmetric. A consequence of http://www.ilog.com/products/cplex/ had not changed in several hours.
 this is that, based on the semantics of critiquing we use here which is quite common, there may be many  X  X urprises X  for users who might expect critiques to behave in a symmetric way, i.e. critiquing a product p i on attribute a j and being led to product p j , but reversing the process does not reach p , might seem unnatural. An interesting use of critique graphs could be to test, or indeed, search for a semantics of critiques that minimizes this kind of behavior.

We show the diameter of the critique graphs in column  X , i.e. the largest shortest-path between reachable products in the graph. This corresponds to the longest optimal cri-tiquing sequence in the product catalogue. We can see from the table that all the catalogues we considered have quite small diameters. For the camera and letting catalogues, it takes at most four properly chosen critiques to reach any product from any other.

Since our critique graphs are directed, the density of a critique graph is defined by: The more dense the graph, the smaller the shortest-paths are between the vertices; in the case of a clique the diameter would be 1. It is obvious from these results that density and diameter are correlated: lower diameters are associated with denser graphs. These statistics suggest that critique graphs often define a small world.
In Table 8 we report a detailed distance-based analysis, where we relate various graph properties to the maximal allowed shortest-path distance  X  . We consider the sizes of the product covers, support sets and  X  -catalogue covers in each case, showing minimum, average and maximum values, as appropriate. The  X  -catalogue covers were computed using cplex , and we report the time to find the optimal size set in seconds, with one exception (see the caption note).
At a very high level, these statistics show that as we in-crease  X  , the size of both the product cover and support sets increases, while the size of the catalogue cover significantly decreases. These trends are to be expected, but the details of the trends are interesting.

Firstly, the sizes of the catalogue covers for these cat-alogues are very small, given the number of products they contain. Typically, one can find fewer than 10% of the prod-ucts that form a catalogue cover that guarantees that all products in the catalogue can be reached by only one cri-tique in the best case. If one relaxes this requirement slightly to two or three critiques the number of products in the cat-alogue cover can reduce to one in some cases. The number of products follows an inverse power-law relationship with  X  . This is very interesting since the numbers of products involved is small enough to fit on a single listing on a small screen of, say, a mobile device while making guarantees that access to all products in the catalogue is possible.
Secondly, the difference between the minimum, average and maximum size product covers is quite uniform for every value of  X  and across catalogues; as the average sized product cover increases, both the minimum and maximum increase similarly. Figure 3 shows this information in much greater detail, presenting for different values of  X  the number of product covers of different sizes. The regularity of these distributions is striking.

However, the trend in the size of support sets is not so uniform. Typically, what we observe is that as  X  increases, the average sized support sets increases rapidly, but the min-imum lags behind (the maximum never changes in this con-text). This is very interesting since this implies that for smaller values of  X  , there tends to be a small number of products that are very hard to reach (as measured by the support set size). The camera data illustrates this point very clearly: the minimum sized support set is very small compared with the average, which in turn tends quickly to-wards the maximum support set size. The products that have support sets significantly smaller than the average are those that are very difficult to find by critiquing, despite the fact that other products are easy to find from them (as measured by the size of the product covers).

For the camera catalogue the largest categorical domain has 15 elements, which makes the smallest cover bounded below by 14, since at least 14 other products can reach every product with the fifteenth value in a single critique. The effect of this lower bound can be seen when we allow only replacement or directional critiques. When restricting to replacement critiques the minimal cover reduces from 21 to 19, while if restricting to directional critiques only, we get the minimal cover of size 4.

Products with large support sets are easily reachable using critiquing navigation. A disproportionably large support set can indicate that the product has some extreme categorical attribute values not shared by many other products. For example, in the camera catalogue there is a product with a support set comprising all 210 products in the catalogue. It turns out that this is the only camera in the catalogue produced by  X  X ontax X . Every time you critique, asking for a Contax camera, you will always get this product.

Products with small support sets suggest that they are hardly reachable through navigation. This often suggests that they have some extreme numerical attributes values that makes them  X  X ar away X , in terms of critique distance, from most other products. Specifically, in our current se-mantics of critiquing, directional critiques favor smaller in-crements since the similarity measure also involves a cri-tiqued attribute. Therefore, if a user critiques asking for larger optical zoom, he will be offered cameras with smaller increments in optical zoom quality, and probably smaller increments in price for that matter. In order to reach the highest quality, and presumably most expensive, camera a user would have to critique through cameras with more mod-erate balances between zoom quality and price. In fact, the camera catalogue supports this intuition. It contains three products with minimal support set size, with only two sup-porting neighbors. Theses cameras are shown in Table 9. All of them have extreme numerical properties: two very cheap and low quality Sony cameras and one very expensive, high quality, very heavy Kodak camera. For comparison, price ranges in the entire camera catalogue are from 100 to 5000, resolution from 1 to 14, and weight from 50 to 1600g. Table 9: Cameras with minimum sized support sets.

We finish our discussion of our empirical studies by look-ing at the frequencies of different critique distances in each of the catalogues we considered. Table 10 presents the num-ber of critique distances of a given length in each catalogue. However, some caution is required when interpreting these numbers. When we normalize these data by expressing fre-quency with respect to the number of directed edges in the Table 10: The distribution of different critique dis-tances in our catalogues.
 critique graph, and the critique distance with respect to cri-tique diameter, we see a very different story in Figure 4. Essentially, each of the catalogues have similar shaped dis-tributions, with relative frequency of critiques appearing somewhere around halfway through the maximum critique distance. However, we see that catalogues that have many categorical attributes (see Table 6  X  Laptops and Travel) tend to have distributions that are skewed to the left, con-firming our intuition that many categorical attributes intro-duce many short critique sequences by adding many edges to the critique graph. Figure 4: Relative frequency of each relative critique distance in the critique graphs for our datasets.
We have introduced a formal approach to studying the behaviour of critique-based recommender systems. Our ap-proach is based on a directed critique multigraph, which makes explicit all possible ways of navigating around a prod-uct catalogue using critiquing and similarity-based reason-ing. We studied an abstraction of the directed critique multi-graph called a directed critique graph, which encodes the critique distances between products. We proved a number of formal properties of catalogue graphs, as well as presented an indepth empirical study of standard product catalogues. We measured the sizes and distributions of product covers and support sets, and showed how these could be used to inform our understanding of the structure of a product cat-alogue and the challenges it would pose for interactive nav-igation. We also proposed the notion of a minimum cata-logue cover as an initial set of products to present to a user in order to ensure that all products in the catalogue can be reached by critiques.

We believe that our approach will be useful to a variety of researchers interested in studying the design of interactive recommender systems. In particular, it would be interesting to use the notion of a critique graph to help design a suitable semantics for critiques for a specific catalogue. It would also be interesting to exploit the graph in the recommendation process itself. Finally, we have proposed catalogue cover as the  X  X ntry-point X  products for critique-based recommenders. Burke [3] and Shimazu [15] propose heuristic approaches for selecting entry-points. We will perform a comparison be-tween these approaches and catalogue covers.
