 In the blogosphere, there exist posts relevant to a particu-lar subject and blogs that show interests in the subject. In this paper, we define a set of such posts and blogs as  X  X log community X  and propose a method for extracting the latent blog community associated with a particular subject. The proposed method is based on the idea that the blogs who have performed actions to the posts of a particular subject are the ones that have interests in the subject, and that the posts which have received actions from such blogs are the ones that contain the subject. The proposed method selects a small number of seed posts that contain the sub-ject. Then, it selects the blogs that perform actions to the seed posts over some threshold and the posts that have re-ceived actions over some threshold. By repeating these two steps, it gradually expands the blog community. The exper-imental results show that the proposed method exhibits a higher level of accuracy than the methods proposed in prior research.

According to Wellman, communities are networks of inter-personal ties that provide sociability, support, information, a sense of belonging, and social identity [1]. Traditionally, communities were equated with neighborhoods bounded by people living near each other, but with the advance of trans-portation, communication technology, and global online con-nectivity in the late 20th century, communities are more and  X

That is, communities are no longer bounded by neighborhoods. One may find many such communities on Internet [1]. Online cafes, blogs, chat rooms, portal-operated bulletin boards, support groups, Internet forums, instant messaging buddy lists, MMORPGs, and corporate websites that foster cus-tomer participation are just a partial list of online commu-nities.

As most online communities operate under membership, the boundary of a community is explicit [2]. But the defini-tion of a community can be broadened to a set of intercon-nected people who share a common interest on a particular subject even when they have not explicitly disclosed their intent of participation or affiliation. In this paper, such a community is defined as a X  X atent X  X ommunity. One may find latent communities in a blogosphere. In a blogosphere, blog-gers express their interests through their actions to posts, such as trackbacks and comments. Therefore, a set of the posts whose contents are related to a particular subject and a set of the bloggers who have shown interests on that sub-ject through their actions to those posts may be considered as a latent community. In this paper, we define the latent community in a blogosphere as a  X  X log community, X  and the bloggers and posts that belong to the blog community as  X  X ommunity members X  X nd X  X ommunity posts, X  respectively.
Since latent communities are not operated under mem-bership, it is difficult to determine the boundary of a latent community or to find the members who belong to the latent community [3]. Most prior research on extracting latent on-line communities associated with a particular subject has been targeted to web communities [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]. A web community consists of a set of interconnected web pages, and the topology formed by hyperlinks between web pages is exploited to find a latent web community. Compared to the web that has a single type of objects called web pages and a single type of actions called hyperlinks, however, a blo-gosphere includes two types of objects, blogs and posts, and various types of actions connecting blogs and posts, such as trackbacks, comments, replies, bookmarks, etc., which makes it difficult to apply the existing methods of extract-ing web communities directly to extract blog communities. This paper proposes a new approach to extract a latent blog community associated with a particular subject.
A post that receives many actions from the blogs that show interests in subject A can be considered as the post on subject A. Similarly, a blog that performs actions to multiple posts on subject A can be considered as the blog that has an interest in subject A. The proposed method builds the community by iteratively expanding community members and community posts, starting from a small number of seed posts which are identified as the posts on subject A.
At each step of the community-extraction process, commu -nity-member candidates and community-post candidates are selected, and among them those which pass the selection cri-teria are added to the community as community members and community posts, respectively. The extraction process terminates when the number of community-post candidates reaches the estimated size of the community.

To explain the iterative process of expanding community members and posts in detail, we use the following notations. The set of community members selected until the i -th step is denoted as CM(i) , and the set of community posts se-lected until the i -th step is denoted as CP(i) . The set of community-member candidates at the i -th step is denoted as CMC(i) , and the set of community-post candidates at the i -th step is denoted as CPC(i) . The threshold used as a criterion for selecting new community members at the i -th step is called e CM(i) , and the threshold used for selecting new community posts at the i -th step is called e CP(i) .
For the time being, let us assume the values of the lower bound , the upper bound, and e CM(1) are given. How to set those values is explained in Section 2.1.3 The iterative expansion proceeds as follows. First, when started, CP(0) includes the set of seed posts selected by the domain expert, and CM(0) is an empty set. Second, the bloggers who have performed any actions to the posts in CP(0) become the community-member candidates of the first step, CMC(1) . Among these candidates, the bloggers which have performed at least e CM(1) number of actions become new community members in CM(1) . Third, the posts that have received any actions from the bloggers in CM(1) become the community-post candidates of the first step, CPC(1) , and among these candidates, the posts which have received at least e CP(1) number of actions are added to the community posts to form CP(1) .

That is, at the i -th step, the bloggers which have per-formed at least e CM(i) number of actions to the commu-nity posts obtained so far, CP(i-1) , are selected to be in-cluded in CM(i) , and the posts which have received at least e CP(i) number of actions from the community members obtained so far, CM(i) , are selected to be included in CP(i) . By continuing the process, the proposed method gradually expands the community. As the number of the community members and the community posts increases throughout the process, the threshold values, e CM(i) and e CP(i) , need to be increased accordingly. How to automatically adjust the threshold values at each step is explained in Section 2.1.2. Figure 1 depicts an example of the extraction process. The values for e CM(1) and e CP(1) are set as 2 and 3, respectively, and assumed to be increased by 1 at each step. The solid arrow represents the action that is counted when selecting community members and posts, while the dotted arrow represents the action not counted. In Figure 1-(a), P6, P10 are the community posts in CP(0) . Bloggers B2, B3, B4, B6, B7, B10, B12 have performed actions to the community posts and thus become CMC(1) . Among these candidates, B2, B4, B7, B10 in gray have performed at least e CM(1) (= 2) number of actions and thus are selected as CM(1) . Figure 1-(b) shows the process of selecting CP(1) from CM(1) selected in Figure 1-(a). Posts P4, P13 have re-ceived at least e CP(1) (= 3) number of actions from CM(1) and are thus added to CP(1) .
As the extraction process proceeds, the number of blog-gers and posts in the community increases, and therefore, the threshold values of e CM(i) and e CP(i) need to be ad-justed accordingly. The threshold values at the i -th step are automatically adjusted based on the minimum number of actions between the community members and posts selected so far.

The value of e CM(i) is adjusted to be the minimum of the number of actions the bloggers in CM(i-1) have performed on the posts in CP(i-1) . This indicates the new members that will be added to CM(i) should have performed at least the minimum number of actions of the existing community members. Similarly, The value of e CP(i) is adjusted to be the minimum of the number of actions the posts in CP(i-1) have received from the bloggers in CM(i) . (a) Selecting B2, B4, B7, 10 from community posts P6, Figure 1: An example of the iterative extraction process.
The community-expansion process terminates when the community post candidates, CPC(i) , approaches the total number of the posts relevant to the subject in the blogo-sphere. In this paper, we set the lower bound to be 90% of the total number of posts relevant to the subject and the upper bound to be 110% of it. If the actual number of the posts relevant to the subject in the blogosphere is unknown, random sampling may be used to estimate the percentage of the posts associated with the subject.

The threshold values of e CM(i) and e CP(i) are automat-ically adjusted during the community-expansion process. The value of e CM(1) , however, cannot be automatically set since there exists no prior step. The threshold value for selecting the initial set of community members, e CM(1) , has a great impact on the quality of the final extracted com-munity. If the value of e CM(1) is set too low, too many bloggers and posts that are not related to the subject may enter into the blog community in the early stage. If the value of e CM(1) is set too high, on the other hand, the ex-traction process terminates without delivering the potential community.

When setting the value of e CM(1) and satisfying the termination criteria, we employ feedback mechanism. At first, e CM(1) is set to be the maximum possible value, i.e., the number of seed posts. Since it is unlikely to find many bloggers which have actions to all seed posts, the al-gorithm is likely to terminate without any expansion. If the feedback suggests that the extraction process terminates too quickly without reaching the termination criteria, the value of e CM(1) is lowered by half of the difference between the current value and the previous value and the extraction pro-cess starts again. Conversely, if the expansion process passes over the termination range, the value of e CM(1) is raised by half of the difference the current value and the previous value, and the extraction process starts again. The feedback mechanism allows to set the value of e CM(1) automatically such that the extraction process terminates when the num-ber of community-post candidates approaches the estimated size.
To improve the accuracy of the proposed method, we pro-pose the following three techniques.
 First, a blog can show interests in many different subjects. In the real world, majority of blogs arrange their posts into folders, and each folder usually has posts related to a single subject of interest. Therefore, when applying the extraction algorithm, one may improve the accuracy of the extracted community by using folders instead of blogs.

Second, when the number of actions is used as the crite-rion for selecting community members, the blogs which show interests in more than a single subject and/or the posts that receive many actions not related to the subject can be in-cluded in the community of the subject in target. To solve this problem, we use a selection criterion based on the purity of actions in addition to the selection criterion based on the number of actions.

When selecting community members, the purity of actions indicates how much of a blog X  X  actions are on the posts re-lated to a particular subject. Therefore the degree of the purity of actions by a bloggers is defined as the ratio be-tween (1) the number of actions by the bloggers to the com-munity posts, and (2) total number of action by the blogger. Similarly, when selecting community posts, the degree of the purity of actions to a post is defined as the ratio between (1) the number of actions received by the post from the commu-nity members, and (2) total number of action by the post.
Third, popular posts are those that have received many actions from bloggers due to its popularity. For example, the post introduced in the main page of the portal site re-ceives a huge number of actions from the blogs which are usually indifferent to the subject of the post. Such popular posts, if selected as community posts, may hinder the correct extraction of the community associated with the subject.
To prevent popular posts from entering into the commu-nity in the step-by-step expansion process, one needs to de-termine what should be considered as popular posts. The basis of being a popular post is set to be the average num-ber of actions that the posts listed in the main portal site receive. If it has received more actions than the basis, the post will be not included in the community post set during the expansion process. When the community extraction is completed, however, those posts, which have been excluded just due to their popularity are included in the final com-munity.
For experimental analysis, this paper used anonymized data which was collected from one of the largest blogospheres in Korea, for several months starting from April 2006. Since the posts with few actions were not likely to exceed the threshold value during the extraction process and thus be included in the final community, the posts that had received less than or equal to 3 actions were removed, and the re-maining posts and the blogs who had performed actions to them were used in experiments.

To evaluate the accuracy of the blog community associ-ated with a particular subject, we selected four subjects: Cooking, Automobiles, English, and Soccer. With the help of domain experts, we selected 80 seed posts for each sub-ject. The domain experts used the criteria of subject rele-vance, quality, quantity of information, and popularity when selecting the seed posts. The percentage of the number of the posts relevant to the subject among all posts in the bl-ogosphere came from the statistics provided by one of the most popular blogospheres and used for estimating the ac-tual number of posts related to the subject, i.e., termination criterion.

To evaluate the proposed method, two accuracy measures were used: community-member accuracy and community-post accuracy. The community-member accuracy measures the ratio of the community members whose contents are truly relevant to the subject to all community members, and the community-post accuracy measures the ratio of the community posts whose contents are truly relevant to the subject to all community posts obtained. Whether the con-tents of a community member or a community post are truly relevant to the subject is determined by the domain experts. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, we compared it with the members proposed in prior research. Among the existing methods, Co-citation, Com-panion[4], Bibliographic Coupling, and Islands Partitioning algorithms[9] were modified to be used in blog environment.
We performed two sets of experiments. First, we applied the modified existing methods and compared the results. Second, we evaluated the impact of the techniques for im-proving the accuracy.

Figure 2 shows the accuracy of the community members and the community posts of a given subject, by comparing the proposed method and the existing methods. For the sub-jects which exhibited a high level of activities, such as Cook-ing, English, and Soccer, all methods showed a high level of accuracy, but the subject with a low level of activities, such as Automobiles, all methods resulted in a relatively low level of accuracy. In all compared methods, the community was extracted based on the seed. When the level of activities was low, the accuracy suffered somewhat due to the irrele-vant blogs and posts being introduced into the community. Figure 2: Accuracy of the proposed method and the existing methods.

In general, the accuracy of community posts is higher than that of community members. This is due to the lag between the data collection period and the period when accuracy was measured. Over time, the contents of posts do not seem to change, but the contents of folders tend to change (by having posts with somewhat different subjects in folders). In the experiments, there was a lapse of two years between the time the data was collected and the time the accuracy was measured. The accuracy was measured by individually visiting the blogs currently in operation. It was verified that there existed the folders which contained the posts that were not relevant to the subject and that in some cases the names of folders had changed as well.

Compared to the existing methods, the proposed method exhibited a higher level of accuracy overall. The Companion algorithm and the Islands Partitioning algorithms extract the candidate blogs and posts first and then select among them the blogs and posts that are related to the seeds such that the blogs and posts irrelevant to the subject may be mixed up in the candidate blogs and posts. This seems to make it difficult to extract the community. On the other hand, the proposed method attempts to prevent the blogs and posts irrelevant to the subject from entering the com-munity by selecting only the blogs and posts that are pos-itively relevant to the subject. The co-citation and Islands Partitioning methods achieved a high level of accuracy com-parable to that of the proposed method. Whereas the pro-posed method can extract both blogs and posts, however, Co-citation can extract posts only and Islands Partitioning can extract blogs only. That is, to extract both blogs and posts, one needs to apply both methods. Furthermore, we note, to resolve the problem of a high similarity score in hyperlinks, we normalized the similarity scores computed from both Co-citation and Bibliographic Coupling, which contributed to their high performance.

We also evaluated the impact of the improvement tech-niques on the accuracy. Figure 3 shows the changes in accu-racy when the each improvement technique is not used. As shown in Figure 3, the accuracy is the highest when all the improvement techniques are used. Use of folders seems to have the biggest impact on the accuracy.
In this paper, we have defined a latent blog community and have discussed the method to extract the latent blog community associated with a particular subject from a blo-gosphere.

We have performed a set of experiments to verify the effec-tiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits a higher level of accuracy than the existing methods. On four different sub-jects tested in the experiments, the proposed method shows more than 85% of accuracy.
