 With the advent of XML as a standard for representation and exchange of structured docum ents, a growing amount of XML-documents are being stored in P eer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. Cur-rent research on P2P search engi nes proposes the use of Informa-tion Retrieval (IR) techniques to perform content-based search, but does not take into account stru ctural features of documents. P2P systems typically have no centr al index, thus avoiding single-points-of-failures, but distribut e all information among partici-pating peers. Accordingly, a querying peer has only limited access to the index information and should select carefully which peers can help answering a given query by contributing resources such as local index informati on or CPU time for ranking compu-tations. Bandwidth consumption is a major issue. To guarantee scalability, P2P systems have to reduce the number of peers in-volved in the retrieval process. As a result, the retrieval quality in terms of recall and precision may suffer substantially. In the proposed thesis, document st ructure is considered as an extra source of information to improve the retrieval quality of XML-documents in a P2P environment. The thesis centres on the following questions: how can stru ctural information help to improve the retrieval of XML-documents in terms of result quality such as precision, recall, and specificity? Can XML structure support the routing of queries in distributed environments, especially the sel ection of promising peers? How can XML IR techniques be used in a P2P network while minimizing bandwidth consumpti on and considering performance aspects? To answer these questions and to analyze possible achievements, a search engine is proposed that e xploits structural hints expressed explicitly by the user or implicitly by the self-describing structure of XML-documents. Additionally , more focused and specific results are obtained by providing ranked retrieval units that can be either XML-documents as a whole or the most relevant passages of theses documents. XML inform ation retrieval techniques are applied in two ways: to select those peers participating in the retrieval process, and to com pute the relevance of documents. The indexing approach includes both content and structural in-formation of documents. To support efficient execution of multi term queries, index keys consist of rare combinations of (content, structure)-tuples. Performance is increased by using only fixed-sized posting lists: frequent index keys are combined with each other iteratively until the new combination is rare, with a posting list size under a pre-set threshold. All posting lists are sorted by taking into account classical IR m easures such as term frequency and inverted term frequency as well as weights for potential retrieval units of a document, with a slight bias towards documents on peers with good collections regarding the current index key and with good peer char acteristics such as online times, available bandwidth, and latency. When extracting the posting list for a specific query, a re-ordering on the posting list is performed th at takes into account the struc-tural similarity between key and query. According to this pre-ranking, peers are selected that are expected to hold information about potentially relevant documents and retrieval units The final ranking is computed in parallel on those selected peers. The computation is based on an extension of the vector space model and distinguishes between we ights for different structures of the same content. This allo ws weighting XML elements with respect to their discriminative power, e.g. a title will be weighted much higher than a footnote. Add itionally, relevance is computed as a mixture of content relevance and structural similarity between a given query and a potential retrieval unit. Currently, a first prototype for P2P Information Retrieval of XML-documents called SPIRIX is being implemented. Experi-ments to evaluate the proposed t echniques and use of structural hints will be performed on a distributed version of the INEX Wikipedia Collection.
