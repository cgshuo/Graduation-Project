 Any given human activity with a particular in-tended outcome is bound to face a non-zero like-lihood of failure. In business, companies are ex-posed to market risks such as new competitors, disruptive technologies, change in customer at-titudes, or a changes in government legislation that can dramatically affect their profitability or threaten their business model or mode of opera-tion. Therefore, any tool to assist in the elicita-tion of otherwise unforeseen risk factors carries tremendous potential value.

However, it is very hard to identify risks ex-haustively, and some types (commonly referred to as the unknown unknowns ) are especially elu-sive: if a known unknown is the established knowl-edge that important risk factors are known, but it is unclear whether and when they become realized, then an unknown unknown is the lack of aware-ness, in practice or in principle, of circumstances that may impact the outcome of a project, for ex-ample. Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls these  X  X lack swans X  (Taleb, 2007).

Companies in the US are required to disclose a list of potential risks in their annual Form 10-K SEC fillings in order to warn (potential) investors, and risks are frequently the topic of conference phone calls about a company X  X  earnings. These risks are often reported in general terms, in par-ticular, because it is quite difficult to pinpoint the unknown unknown , i.e. what kind of risk is con-cretely going to materialize. On the other hand, there is a stream of valuable evidence available on the Web, such as news messages, blog entries, and analysts X  reports talking about companies X  perfor-mance and products. Financial analysts and risk officers in large companies have not enjoyed any text analytics support so far, and risk lists devised using questionnaires or interviews are unlikely to be exhaustive due to small sample size, a gap which we aim to address in this paper.

To this end, we propose to use a combination of Web Mining (WM) and Information Eextrac-tion (IE) to assist humans interested in risk (with respect to an organization) and to bridge the gap between the general language and concrete risks. We describe our system, which is divided in two main parts: (a) an offline Risk Miner that facili-tates the risk identification step of the risk manage-ment process, and an online (b) Risk Monitor that supports the risk monitoring step (cf. Figure 2). In addition, a Risk Mapper can aggregate and visu-alize the evidence in the form of a risk map . Our risk mining algorithm combines Riloff hyponym patterns with recursive Web pattern bootstrapping and a graph representation.

We do not know of any other implemented end-to-end system for computer-assisted risk identifi-cation/visualization using text mining technology. Financial IE. IE systems have been applied to the financial domain on Message Understanding Con-test (MUC) like tasks, ranging from named en-tity tagging to slot filling in templates (Costantino, 1992).
 Automatic Knowledge Acquisition. (Hearst, 1992) pioneered the pattern-based extraction of hyponyms from corpora, which laid the ground-work for subsequent work, and which included ex-traction of knowledge from to the Web (e.g. (Et-zioni et al., 2004)). To improve precision was the mission of (Kozareva et al., 2008), which was de-signed to extract hyponymy, but they did so at the expense of recall, using longer dual anchored pat-terns and a pattern linkage graph. However, their method is by its very nature unable to deal with low-frequency items, and their system does not contain a chunker, so only single term items can be extracted. De Saenger et al. (De Saeger et al., 2008) describe an approach that extracts instances of the  X  X rouble X  or  X  X bstacle X  relations from the Web in the form of pairs of fillers for these bi-nary relations. Their approach, which is described for the Japanese language, uses support vector ma-chine learning and relies on a Japanese syntac-tic parser, which permits them to process nega-tion. In contrast, and unlike their method, we pur-sue a more general, open-ended search process, which does not impose as much a priori knowl-edge. Also, they create a set of pairs, whereas our approach creates a taxonomy tree as output. Most importantly though, our approach is not driven by frequency, and was instead designed to work es-pecially with rare occurrences in mind to permit  X  X lack swan X -type risk discovery.
 Correlation of Volatility and Text. (Kogan et al., 2009) study the correlation between share price volatility, a proxy for risk, and a set of trigger words occurring in 60,000 SEC 10-K filings from 1995-2006. Since the disclosure of a company X  X  risks is mandatory by law, SEC reports provide a rich source. Their trigger words are selected a priori by humans; in contrast, risk mining as ex-ercised in this paper aims to find risk-indicative words and phrases automatically.
 Kogan and colleagues attempt to find a regres-sion model using very simple unigram features based on whole documents that predicts volatility, whereas our goal is to automatically extract pat-terns to be used as alerts.
 Speculative Language &amp; NLP. Light et al. (Light et al., 2004) found that sub-string matching of 14 pre-defined string literals outperforms an SVM classifier using bag-of-words features in the task of speculative language detection in medical ab-stracts. (Goldberg et al., 2009) are concerned with automatic recognition of human wishes, as ex-pressed in human notes for Year X  X  Eve. They use a bi-partite graph-based approach, where one kind of node (content node) represents things people wish for ( X  world peace  X ) and the other kind of node (template nodes) represent templates that ex-tract them (e.g.  X  I wish for ___  X ). Wishes can be seen as positive Q , in our formalization. We apply the mined risk extraction patterns to a corpus of financial documents. The data originates from the StreetEvents database and was kindly provided to us by Starmine, a Thomson Reuters company. In particular, we are dealing with 170k earning calls transcripts, a text type that contains monologue (company executives reporting about their company X  X  performance and general situa-tion) as well as dialogue (in the form of ques-tions and answers at the end of each conference call). Participants typically include select business analysts from investment banks, and the calls are published afterwards for the shareholders X  bene-fits. Figure 1 shows some example excerpts. We randomly took a sample of N=6,185 transcripts to use them in our risk alerting experiments. 1 4.1 System The overall system is divided into two core parts: (a) Risk Mining and (b) Risk Monitoring (cf. Fig-ure 2). For demonstration purposes, we add a (c) Risk Mapper, a visualization component. We de-scribe how a variety of risks can be identified given a normally very high-level description of risks, as one can find in earnings reports, other finan-cial news, or the risk section of 10-K SEC filings. Starting with rather abstract descriptions such as operational risks and hyponym-inducing pattern " &lt; RISK &gt; such as *" , we use the Web to mine pages from which we can harvest additional, and eventually more concrete, candidates, and re-late them to risk types via a transitive chain of bi-nary IS-A relations. Contrary to the related work, we use a base NP chunker and download the full pages returned by the search engine rather than search snippets in order to be able to extract risk phrases rather than just terms, which reduces con-textual ambiguity and thus increases overall preci-sion. The taxonomy learning method described in the following subsection determines a risk taxon-omy and new risks patterns.
 Figure 2: The risk mining and monitoring system architecture
The second part of the system, the Risk Mon-itor, takes the risks from the risk taxonomy and uses them for monitoring financial text streams such as news, SEC filings, or (in our use case) earnings reports. Using this, an analyst is then able to identify concrete risks in news messages and link them to the high-level risk descriptions. He or she may want to identify operational risks such as fraud for a particular company, for instance. The risk taxonomy can also derive further risks in this category (e.g., faulty components, brakes) for exploration and drill-down analysis. Thus, news reports about faulty breaks in (e.g. Toyota) or volcano outbreaks (e.g. Iceland) can be directly linked to the risk as stated in earnings reports or security filings.

Our Risk Miner and Risk Monitor are imple-mented in Perl, with the graph processing of the taxonomy implemented in SWI-Prolog, whereas the Risk Mapper exists in two versions, a static image generator for R 2 and, alternatively, an in-teractive Web page (DHTML, JavaScript, and us-ing Google X  X  Chart API). We use the Yahoo Web search API. 4.2 Taxonomy induction method Using frequency to compute confidence in a pat-tern does not work for risk mining, however, be-cause mention of particular risks might be rare. In-stead of frequency based indicators (n-grams, fre-quency weights), we rely on two types of struc-tural confidence validation, namely (a) previously identified risks and (b) previously acquired struc-tural patterns. Note, however, that we can still use PageRank, a popularity-based graph algorithm, because multiple patterns might be connected to a risk term or phrase, even in the absence of fre-quency counts for each (i.e., we interpret popular-ity as having multiple sources of support). 1. Risk Candidate Extraction Step. The first step is used to extract a list of risks based on high precision patterns. However, it has been shown that the use of such patterns (e.g., such as ) quickly lead to an decrease in precision. Ideally, we want to retrieve specific risks by re-applying the the ex-tract risk descriptions: Figure 3: A sample IS-A and Pattern network with sample PageRank scores. (a) Take a seed, instantiate " &lt; SEED &gt; such (b) For each candidate from the list of instances, 2. Risk Validation. Since the Risk Candidate extraction step will also find many false positives, we need to factor in information that validates that the extracted risk is indeed a risk. We do this by constructing a possible pattern containing this new risk. (a) Append "* risks" to the output of 1(b) in (b) extract new risk pattern by substituting the
In order to benefit from any human observations of system errors in future runs, we also extended the system so as to read in a partial list of pre-defined risks at startup time, which can guide the risk miner; while technically different from active learning, this approach was somewhat inspired by it (but our feedback is more loose). 3. Constructing Risk Graph. We have now reached the point where we constructed a graph with risks and patterns. Risks are connected via IS-A links; risks and patterns are connected via PATTERN links. Note that there are links from risks to patterns and from patterns to risks; some risks back-pointed by a pattern may actually not be a risk (e.g., people ). However, this node is also not connected to a more abstract risk node and will therefore have a low PageRank score. Risks that are connected to patterns that have a high au-thority (i.e., pointing to by many other links) are highly ranked within PageRank (Figure 3). The risk black Swan , for example, has only one pat-tern it occurs in, but this pattern can be filled by many other risks (e.g., fire, regulations). Hence, the PageRank score of the black swan is high sim-ilar to well known risks, such as fraud . 4.3 Risk alerting method We compile the risk taxonomy into a trie automa-ton, and create a second trie for company names from the meta-data of our corpus. The Risk Mon-itor reads the two tries and uses the first to de-tect mentions of risks in the earning reports and the second one to tag company names, both using case-insensitive matching for better recall. Op-tionally, we can use Porter stemming during trie construction and matching to trade precision for even higher recall, but in the experiments reported here this is not used. Once a signal term or phrase matches, we look up its risk type in a hash table, take a note of the company that the current earn-ings report is about, and increase the frequency Figure 4: Selected financial risk tuples after Web validation. count for this  X  company; risk type  X  tuple, which we use for graphic rendering purposes. 4.4 Risk mapping method To demonstrate the method presented here, we cre-ated a visualization that displays a risk map , which is a two dimensional table showing companies and the types of risk they are facing, together with bub-ble sizes proportional to the number of alerts that the Risk Monitor could discover in the corpus. The second option also permits the user to explore the detected risk mentions per company and by risk type. From the Web mining process, we obtain a set of pairs (Figure 4), from which the taxonomy is constructed. In one run with only 12 seeds (just the risk type names with variants), we obtained a taxonomy with 280 validated leave nodes that are connected transitively to the risks root node.
Our resulting system produces visualizations we call  X  X isk maps X , because they graphically present the extracted risk types in aggregated form. A set of risk types can be selected for pre-sentation as well as a set of companies of interest. A risk map display is then generated using either R (Figure 5) or an interactive Web page, depend-ing on the user X  X  preference.

Qualitative error analysis. We inspected the output of the risk miner and observed the follow-ing classes of issues: (a) chunker errors: if phrasal boundaries are placed at the wrong position, the taxonomy will include wrong relations. For exam-ple, deictic determiners such as  X  X his X  were a prob-lem (e.g. that IS-A indirect risks ) be-fore we introduced a stop word filter that discards candidate tuples that contain no content words. Another prominent example is  X  X hort term X  in-stead of the correct  X  X hort term risk X ; (b) seman-tic drift 3 : due to polysemy, words and phrases can denote risk and non-risk meanings, depend-ing on context. Talking about risks even a spe-cific pattern such as  X  X uch as X  [sic] is used by au-thors to induce a variety of perspectives on the topic of risk, and after several iterations negative effects of type (a) errors compound; (c) off-topic relations: the seeds are designed to induce a tax-onomy specific to risk types. As a side effect, many (correct or incorrect) irrelevant relations are learned, e.g. credit and debit cards is-a money transfer . We currently dis-card these by virtue of ignoring all relations not transitively connected with the root node risks , so no formalized domain knowledge is required; (d) overlap: the concept space is divided up dif-ferently by different writers, both on the Web and in the risk management literature, and this is reflected by multiple category membership of many risks (e.g. is cash flow primarily an oper-ational risk or a financial risk?). Currently, we do not deal with this phenomenon automatically; (e) redundant relations: at the time of writing, we do not cache all already extracted and validated risks/non-risks. This means there is room for im-provement w.r.t. runtime, because we make more Web queries than strictly necessary. While we have not evaluated this system yet, we found by in-specting the output that our method is particularly effective for learning natural disasters and med-ical conditions, probably because they are well-covered by news sites and biomedical abstracts on the Web. We also found that some classes contain more noise than others, for example operational risk was less precise than financial risk, proba-bly due to the lesser specificity of the former risk type. Summary of Contributions.

In this paper, we introduced the task of risk min-ing, which produces patterns that are useful in an-other task, risk alerting. Both tasks provide com-putational assistance to risk-related decision mak-ing in the financial sector. We described a special-purpose algorithm for inducing a risk taxonomy offline, which can then be used online to analyze earning reports in order to signal risks. In do-ing so, we have addressed two research questions of general relevance, namely how to extract rare patterns , for which frequency-based methods fail, and how to use the Web to bridge the vocabulary gap , i.e. how to match up terms and phrases in financial news prose with the more abstract lan-guage typically used in talking about risk in gen-eral.
 We have described an implemented demonstrator system comprising an offline risk taxonomy miner, an online risk alerter and a visualization compo-nent that creates visual risk maps by company and risk type, which we have applied to a corpus of earnings call transcripts.

Future Work. Extracted negative and also pos-itive risks can be used in many applications, rang-ing from e-mail alerts to determinating credit rat-ings . Our preliminary work on risk maps can be put on a more theoretical footing (Hunter, 2000). After studying further how output of risk alert-ing correlates 4 with non-textual signals like share price, risk detection signals could inform human or trading decisions.
