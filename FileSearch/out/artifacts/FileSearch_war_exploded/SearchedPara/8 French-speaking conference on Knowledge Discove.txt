 In this paper, we provide a report about the 8 th conference on Knowledge Di scovery and Management (EGC X 2008) [1] held in Sophia Antipolis, France, from January 29 th to February 1 st , 2008. Since 2001, this annual conference has been supported by the French-speaking association (EGC Association) which aims at promoting Data Mining and Knowledge Management for both research issues and applications in companies. EGC2008 may be su mmarized in some key figures: 130 submitted papers, 40 accepted long papers (33% selection ratio) published in a special issue of a review and completed with 30 short papers, 15 posters, and 8 software demonstrations; 9 joined workshops and 2 tutorials; 4 keynote talks; a best paper contest rewarded by 2 prizes of 1500 euros each; and 250 participants from 14 countries.
 The 9 th EGC conference will be held in Strasbourg, France, in January 27-30, 2009 [2].
 Conference report, French-speaking community, Data mining, Knowledge Management and Engineering. In the last decade, the French-speaking scientific community has been very active in the research and application framework of Knowledge Discovery and Management (KDM) , which is concerned with: Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery, Business Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering, Semantic Web, etc. This recent framework has also been strongly stimulated by the rapid growth of information systems and the web semantic issues. In this context, in 2002, was founded the EGC 1 French-speaking association which aims at promoting the exchanges between researchers and companies concerned with issues and applications in KDM. The association offers a website [3] and a moderated mailing list 2 registering 1000 members, supports an annual French-speaking conference , and delivers an award to the best research and application papers (2 prizes of 1500 euros each). The success of the first conference, EGC2001 in Nantes, led to the creation of the EGC association in 2002 and to 8 subsequent editions of the conference: Montpellier (2002), Lyon (2003), Clermont-Ferrand (2004), Paris (2005), Lille (2006), Namur Belgium (2007), and Sophia-Antipolis (2008). While the conference has been dedicated to Knowledge Discovery and Management, it remains a large spectrum conference addressing a large variety of research topics and applications in this area. The selection policy of EGC consis ts in both selecting high value papers, and giving a chance to preliminary works. Hence, 4 formats of acceptance distinguish the different kinds of works in order of relevance: long papers (12 pages) for advanced and valued works, short papers (6 pages) for intermediate results and works in progress, posters (2 pages abstract) for relevant works that remain to be improved, and software demonstrations (2 pages abstract). Each submission is reviewed by at least 3 referees of the program committee, which includes member s from 12 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, and USA). Of the 150 abstracts received, 126 full papers were submitted to the cyberchair of EGC2008. The recommendations of the 378 referees X  reports led to the selection of: 42 long papers (33% selection ratio) , 27 short papers, 15 posters, and 6 software demonstrations. The conference proceedings include the whole selected papers completed with the invited talks. Since 2001, and in order to guaranty the visibility of the publication, the proceedings have been published in French-speaking reviews: RIA-ECA review , Herm X s Science Publication, Lavoisier ( [4], [5], [6]), then RNTI review, C X padu X s [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]). In complement, the visibility of the publications is improved with the full indexation of the Proceedings by DBLP [12], and the availability of paper abstracts on the website of EGC Association. The conference takes place over 4 days and the program is composed of a large variety of events: tutorials, workshops, regular talks, invited talks, dem onstrations, posters, a best paper contest, and social events. Since 2004, an Honorary Chair is attributed to a confirmed and internationally recognized researcher on the topics of the conference. The Honorary Chair of EGC2008 was conducted by Osmar Za X ane from the Univers ity of Alberta, Canada. In previous editions, we were pleased to welcome Gregory Piatetky-Shapiro (2004 and 2005), Heikki Mannila (2006), and Einoshin Suzuki (2007). The EGC2008 program included 4 valuable invited talks : (1) Fran X oise Souli X  Fogelman , KXEN, France, Data Mining in companies: issues and perspectives ; (2) Daniel Dardailler , W3C consortium, France, Semantic Web and open standards; (3) Usama Fayyad , Yahoo!, USA, Inventing the New Sciences of the Internet: Towards Understandi ng the New Interactive Media ; (4) Osmar Za X ane , University of Alberta, Canada, Mining Social Networks. The invited talks were recorded and the videos are available on the conference website [1]. The first day of the conference was dedicated to 2 tutorials and 9 workshops . It met a great success with about 140 participants. The workshops addressed a large vari ety of topics: Mining Complex Data, Multimedia Data, Data Flows, Post-processing and Knowledge Quality, Visualization, User Models and Interfaces, Semantic Measures, Usage Analysis &amp; Urban Mobility, Knowledge Modelling, completed with the 2 tutorials on Bayesian Networks, and La nguages of Semantic Web. The full proceedings of the tutorial and workshop sessions are published by the EGC Association in a paper version. A full electronic version is also downloadable from the conference and association websites ( [1], [3]). The program was composed of 8 sessions for regular papers, addressing a wide set of topics : Semantic Web, Ontologies, Information Retrieval, Visualiza tion, Large Data, Classification, Clustering, Patterns and Asso ciations Mining, Multimedia Mining, Data Streams and Sequence Mining, Graph Mining, Text Mining. The regular sessions were comp leted with a plenary session demonstration abstract. The conference met also a real success with more than 220 participants. The EGC Association awards 2 prices of 1500 euros each to the stage, and on the basis of the referees X  reports, the steering committee nominated 12 best papers among the whole accepted long papers. Then, the Steering Committee selected the 2 best works, which were about  X  X  ctionable SVM X  and  X  X patio-temporal patterns X . We are thankful to the EGC association and the steering committee for providing the opportunity to organize this event and for their assistance. Special thanks to the members of the EGC2008 program committee for the high quality papers reviews and to the members of the EGC2008 organizing committee for the assistance in the successful organization of the conference and local arrangements this year.
