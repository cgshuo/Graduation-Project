Emergent Information Technologies and Enabling Policies for Counter-Terrorism, Robert L. Popp, John Yen (Eds.), John Wiley and Sons, New Jersey (2006). US $115.00, ISBN: 978-0-471-78655-9 Let us begin by describing the authors Robert L. Popp, Ph.D. and John Yen, Ph.D. Dr. Popp earned his
Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Connecticut. He is a veteran airman and he has been a part of the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), as a visiting research scientist. He currently holds two patents and is Deputy Director of the Information Awareness Office, the Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on
Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC), and the Chairman of IEEE SMC Society X  X  Adaptive Computative Sys-tems Technical Committee (DARPA, 2005).

Dr. Yen is a Professor of Information Science and Technology (IST), at Pennsylvania State. His area of expertise includes artificial intelligence (AI), automated reasoning, antiterrorism and agent-based collabora-tive technologies. He received his doctorate from the University of Berkley in California. He has been involved in a project to develop processes of a tactical operations center (TOC), funded by the Army Digitization Office. The DOD, the Army Research Lab (ARL), and Dell have utilized him in their efforts.
 The purpose of their book was a review of how to use technology to overcome security threats to the United
States. America does not know exactly whom the new enemy is, as discovered by the authors as they compared modern war to past wars. The introduction of the book begins by stating the problem:  X  X  X he current enemy does not follow the Geneva Convention; the current enemy does not see weapons of mass destruction as a last resort; the current enemy uses cell phones, Internet, financial systems, the press and an array of media to accomplish their tasks; and the enemy moves freely throughout the world using legal weapons X  X . Failed states are defined as lawlessness, hatemongering and thuggish states where leaders seek revenge, kill opposition, retaliate against perceived humiliations and do not have the best interest of their people in mind. Failed states appear to be breeding grounds for terrorists.
 Iraq and Afghanistan have shown military success in pre and post conflict through conducted Stability
Operations that require a deep social awareness of the threats and operational environment in which they re-side. Winning the hearts and minds of the local population is an important stage in instilling a sense of equal-ity and successfully completing a stability operation. What Information Technology can support these feats? What IT can accurately label and detect signatures of terrorists prior to attacks?
The book assumes you know what 9/11 means to an American, that you know American history basics and that you agree with the opinion that there were detectable clues before 9/11; but the clues were generally not understood until after the fact. The point of the book is to detect these signatures prior to large events. The authors do not present a negative opinion of the agencies of the United States.

This book begins with patterns of difference human phenomena in relation to social sciences (i.e. anthro-pology and psychology), to establish the threat. Among the topics discussed is qualitative/computational tech-nologies used for failed state analysis. This includes many levels of use and verifies validity of key elements with research and experiments. This gives a layout of discovering what the threat is. In a number of the begin-ning sections, the wars in the history of the United States are compared to the War on Terrorism to compare the differences in battles and displaying the need for IT.

The first subsection of every chapter talks about the chapter X  X  content. The last subsection of every section is a summary of the section and the last section of every chapter is a summary of the chapter. The summaries include a reiteration of the significance of the tasks and how it will be accomplished as well as an overview of the content learned. All ideas throughout are explored.

Terrorist actions are titled as transactions. A comparison to a money transaction is made, whereas move-ments, action, behaviors of a terrorist are as traceable as a signature, transfer, deposit, or withdrawal. In an attempt to explain and describe a model for tracing transactions, the authors talk of the background and dis-creet utilization of the Markov Model and Bayesian Networks. The authors demonstrate these models with a range of graphs, charts, figures and equations. These difficult models are broken down in a learner friendly discussion to the extent that an individual newly introduced to the social sciences can understand these mod-els. The relationship to each other and to counter-terrorism is drawn out very well. A comparison of models in Intelligence Analysis and Synthesis is provided.

Anticipatory Models are also used with the discipline of multi-ontology to predict terrorist behavior. In an attempt to  X  X onnect the dots X , the authors review the significance of Intelligence Analysis and Synthesis and apply its concept models to Anticipatory Models. Knowledge Management (KM), comes into play at this point with the need for context. The authors X  parsimonious approach is based on the difference between con-tent and context illustrated by how context adds to the learning experience taken place by collaboration.
The body of the book has to do with the IT utilized for counter-terrorism efforts and an extensive explana-tion why a specific tool has been chosen by comparing the needs with the results of the IT tool. As a transition from the problem into the IT solution, the authors dedicate a chapter to KM. The benefits of adding structure and  X  X ngesting data in more than one way X , is extensively discussed. Transforming Data Technologies are de-scribed and defined. Data in different forms of media are a concern and the transformation to hardware is ex-plained with many flow charts, pictures, time tables, and illustrations. The Transformation Methods include Clustering, Information-theoretic Co-clustering, Ant-based Clustering, Learning-based Techniques, Matrix Algebra and Projection Techniques, Context Specific Bayesian Networks, and Support Vector Machines.
Starting from the very basics, the authors describe Semantic Web Technology for Terrorist Network Ana-lysis. Search engine results are semantic and therefore, irrelevant hits are displayed. The authors discuss the Semantic Web Portal, which gives the user the ability to execute  X  X mart searches X .

KM is brought into play again with Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Technologies. Three chal-lenges to consider are: retrieval and discovery; accessibility; and the diversity of the information. The discov-ery and retrieving of relevant information is not a simple task with the overwhelming amount of information thrown at a user from the World Wide Web. Second, the opportunity to transforming knowledge to user-friendly knowledge is in high demand. Lastly, the users and information on the Internet is very diverse.
The section on improving National and Homeland Security addresses these issues by defining the needs, dif-ferent approaches, theories (verified with research), and integration of systems.

After exploring KM, the authors dig into the technologies available and define dimensions of the informa-tion sharing problem. The authors X  concerns with the information sharing problem are alleviated with integra-tion of various solutions answering the question,  X  X  X ow is it possible to facilitate sharing across different departments including CIA and FBI? X  X  Evidence has been shown that 9/11 could have been stopped if analysts had developed a way to,  X  X onnect the dots X , across two or more organizations.

This clearly being a KM issue, the authors mention the barriers and the architecture needed alongside key elements required for functionality. Throughout the discussion the knowledge lifecycle is described and solu-tions are proposed at every stage. The application of KM to counter-terrorism is illustrated with a brief over-view of the chosen solutions. Techniques include such approaches as Automated Markup, Generation From Free Text, Semantic Filtering, Co-reference Reasoning, and Hybrid Evidential Reasoning.

This book suggests where the authors want to be with IT, namely to support the Intelligence Community X  X  goal of collaboration with  X  X  X ho knows what X  X , as a focus. KM is weighed heavily in the design of Crisis Man-agement Support IT solutions. Popp and Yen use the metaphor  X  X  X ower of Babel X  X  to mention the language barrier involved in research. Information Retrieval Systems (IR), find information; they do not analyze what perspective a user wants. IR provides the individual with a broad overview; however, users get smarter about their search techniques, not the IR system. These two problems are defeated and short term goals are based on overcoming the barriers.
Subsequently, the strategy changes in the models used  X  X rom analysis to inquiry X . The discussion returns to the beginning of the book to suggest how Behavioral Network Analysis plays a role in terrorist detection.
From the book X  X  perspective, terrorist detection is the initial goal to avoid a similar attack to 9/11. Popp and Yen set out to state the problem and task themselves to answer,  X  X  X ow do we fix it? X  X  The authors begin with models, theories and validations, and experiments in research. The authors draw in the needs of the intel-ligence community as a whole and build an overall requirements framework until they have explored every need down to the individual user level. Then, analyze an array of IT tools to accomplish their goals starting with the individual, dabble with groups and focus on the organizations. The authors simulate each tool to find individual strengths and weaknesses and draw the lines from theory to practice using flow charts, comparison charts, diagrams, illustrations, maps, models and screens shots.

A reader having minimal knowledge of the US history, problems with terrorism or of a definition of coun-ter-terrorism could easily follow this book. A reader must have some knowledge of IT to develop a sense of appreciation for the vocabulary and functionality of the IT tools discussed. KM goals are explained and a user new to KM could easily understand the  X  X hy X ,  X  X hat X  and  X  X ow X  used throughout the KM initiatives in the book. Popp and Yen have mastered the crucial point of organizing an abundant amount of information, alongside a wealth of explorations.
