We pursue this aim by integrating a goal-oriented and a business process-oriented modelling language. There are several criteria that one would expect from modelling mentioned criteria, revealing that the challenge remains open.

Modelling Framework (GMF, http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp) to implement the metamodels and modelling tools for each method. We have followed a Model-Driven layer of MDA.
