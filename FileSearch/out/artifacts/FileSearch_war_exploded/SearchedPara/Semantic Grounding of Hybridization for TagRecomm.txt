 As a promptly emerged popular way, social tags allow users to annotate, categorize and find web resources by assigning one or more descriptive words (called tags) in folksonomies, such as Flickr 1 , Bibsonomy 2 . Thus, the tags assigned to each resource create a bridge between heterogeneous data and users who are accustomed to keyword-based search and browsing. To create this asso ciation, social tagging systems demand users to manually annotate tags for each resource [1]. However, manual assignment of tags results in the following problems: 1) Tags assigned by users are sometime very specific and sometime very general; 2) The re may exist cold start problem for new resources, as new resources do not acquire enough tags quickly; 3) Tag assignment is potentially time-consuming. Therefore, many researchers try to work on proposing some tag recommendation methods for addressing the above problems [2,3,4].
In current folksonomy services, there are four major frameworks used for tag recom-mendation: a) Graph connectivity based approaches, e.g., FolkRank [5,3], a variation of PageRank; b) Keywords matching based collaborative filtering approaches like [4,6,7] by using similar tags and contents of simila r resources; c) topic layer (semantically re-lated cluster of words) based approaches [8]; d) Mixture of many existing approaches and additional context component [9]. The first approach only works on a dense core of folksonomy while folksonomy usually has a sparse structure. The second approach is an essential method of keywords extraction based on word frequency but not on word semantic. Both of them can only recommend tags with highest scores from the collec-tion of tags which have been posted previously, and can not recommend tags for new resources. The third approach is suitable for sparse kind of data and can recommend tags for newly arriving resources, but it still does not perform well because it simulta-neously models many entities such as words, tags and users. What is more, it creates much noise [10]. The forth hybrid approach can do better recommendations to some extent, but its applications are limited to many context factors.

Previously, we investigate tag recommendation on Bibsonomy dataset 3 by hybrid approaches of keyword and semantic (i.e., topic-related) knowledge. Keyword based approaches are precise presentation of words, while topic modeling approaches may be not. Intuitively, topic modeling approaches represent a combination of related words as a topic. Only using topic modeling itself is too loutish for tag recommendation [11]. In this paper, we individually use keyword based and semantic based approaches as baselines to predict tags at first. Then we propose hybrid approaches to combine them pairwise. For keyword based approach, we use Language Model (LM). For semantic based approach, we employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [12], Tag-Topic model (TT, which is adapted from Author Topic model [13]) and User-Tag-Topic model (UTT, which is adapted from Author-Conference-Topic model [14]), respectively. The exper-imental result shows that LM can perform better than other approaches, and hybrid approaches with fewer entities outperform the hybrid approach es with more entities.
The novelty of this work lies in: 1) We propose hybrid approaches which combine keyword based approach and topic layer ba sed approach to deal with the tag recom-mendation issue; 2) We use both description words and tags associated with a resource as the candidate set individually in hybrid approach; 3) We verify the e ff ectiveness of our approach through experiments conducted on a real-world dataset. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to compare the e ff ectiveness of tag recommendation approaches by using both words and tags in hybrid approaches.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 provides related work. Section 3 illustrates baselines and the proposed hybr id approaches for tag recommendation. In Section 4, experiments and performance evaluation about the proposed approaches are conducted. Section 5 brings th is paper to the conclusions. With the emergence of social tagging sy stems, tag recommendation has become an attractive area of research. Some important ch aracteristics of social tagging systems are studied. 1) Keywords appeared in a resource are usually selected as tags by users; 2) Similar kind of tags is assigned to similar kind of resources; 3) Users with the similar interests influence each other X  s annotation activities [15,16].
 Usually, tags are recommended on the basis of tags posted to similar posts. Auto-Tag [4] and TagAssist [6] use some information retrieval skills to recommend tags for web blog posts. Co-occurrence of tags was used to complement user-defined tags of photographs in Flickr [17]. An association rule mining approach is proposed for tag recommendation utilizing the association structure of tags [18]. Recently, FolkRank, an adaption of famous PageRank [10], is proposed to recommend tags on the basis of graph connectivity. Although aforementioned methods are always seen in most current social tagging systems, they are unable to p erform well because of not sharing tags in the candidate set.

In addition, tag recommendation approaches based on posted tags are always doubted by the requirements of su ffi cient annotations for a target resource and have cold-start problem for newly arriving resources, which are highlighted by Hsu and Chen [2]. Therefore, they propose a supervised tag recommendation model to predict the stabi-lized tag for a target resource. Meanwhile, as a major task of RSDC2008 challenge 4 ,tag recommendation using semantic information is proposed. In that challenge, Zhang et al [8] propose a hybrid approach based on LM and ACT model using content information to label a new resource. Tags and users of resources are modeled together by using the topic layer to capture the sem antics of text. Their main assumption is that words are responsible for generating tags and users of those tags do not match with the real world situation in which users usually generate tags for resources. As shown in [10], modeling more objects together in topic layer based approaches results in poor performance. In-tuitively, we propose simpler hybrid approaches by using just description words or tags that can perform better than complex topic modeling based non-hybrid approaches. 3.1 Keyword Based Approaches LM is widely used in natural language pro cessing applications such as speech recog-nition and information retrieval. Its goal is to try to characterize, capture, and exploit regularities in the collection of documents, and assign a reasonable probability distri-bution to all words. Accordingly, it can score all the words in the candidate set and recommends words with highest scores for tags.

The basic idea of LM is to interpret the relevance between a document and a query as a generative probability for the query from the document model: where w is a query word token in q . P(q | d) is the probability of the document model gen-erating the query words under the Bag of Words (BoW) assumption[19]. P(w | d) is the probability for generating word w from the document model d , which is usually speci-fied by using the smoothing techniques (like Dirichlet smoothing [20]). The probability is a score, calculated by following Eq.2: where | d | is the length of document d , tf(w,d) is the word frequency (i.e. number of words) of word w in d , | D | is the number of word tokens in the whole collection, and tf(w, D ) is the word frequency of word w in the whole collection D .  X  is the Dirichlet prior and its value is set according to the av erage document length in the document collection, which is set to 10 in our case.

In this paper, we propose three keyword based tag recommendation approaches in terms of di ff erent candidate sets: Word Language Model ( wLM ), Tag Language Model ( tLM )and CombLM , which are variants of Language Model.
 Word Language Model (wLM). wLM uses description words posted by all users for a specific resource as the candidate set. In wLM , a resource is viewed as a composition of the description words written by all tagging users. Symbolically, for a resource r we user u i on a specific resource. According to original LM, the probability for generating aword w i from the resource r is: Tag Language Model (tLM). tLM uses tags posted by all users for a specific resource as the candidate set. In tLM , a resource is viewed as a collection of the tags for a specific resource given by all users. Symbolically, for a resource r we can write it as: r = { u 1 t 1 + Like as wLM , we calculate the probability for a tag t i from the collection by Eq.4: CombLM. In fact, there are both description words and tags for a given resource in a social tagging system. Description words can be considered as summary for a resource, and tags can be thought as semantic annotation for a resource. Consequently, both can be used as the candidate set for tag recommendation. We propose a simple approach for tag recommendation combining description words and tags on wLM and tLM .The score of a tag for a given resource by CombLM can be calculated by Eq.5: 3.2 Topic Modeling Approaches Topic models are based upon the idea that documents are mixtures of topics, where a topic is a probability distribution over words. Now, there are many variants or extensions of topic model. In this paper, we use four adaptive topic models for our task: wLDA (LDA over description), tLDA (LDA over tags), TT model [13], UTT model [14].
As a basic topic model, LDA is widely used to model documents. It specifies a sim-ple probabilistic procedure by which documents can be generated. First, for each doc-ument d , a multinomial distribution  X  d over topics is randomly sampled from a Dirich-let distribution with parameter  X  . Second, for each word w , a topic z is chosen from this topic distribution. Finally, the word w is generated by randomly sampling from a topic-specific multinomial distribution  X  z . The generating probability of word w from document D for LDA is given as: Word Latent Dirichlet Allocation (wLDA). wLDA uses description words posted by all users for a specific resource. In wLDA , a resource is viewed as a composition of the description words written by all tagging users. Symbolically, for a resource r we can user u i about a specific resource r . According to basic LDA equation, the generating probability of word w from resources for LDA is given as Eq.7.
 Tags Latent Dirichlet Allocation (tLDA). tLDA uses tags posted by all users for a specific resource. In tLDA a resource is viewed as a collection of the tags given by all users to a specific resource. Symbolically, for a resource r we can write it as: r = { u 1 t 1 + as wLDA , we calculate the probability for a tag t from the collection by Eq. 8. Tag-Topic Model (TT). LDA is extended to model words and authors simultaneously by using latent topics, named Author-Topic Model [13]. We propose its variation in which, each tag of a resource r is associated with a multinomial distribution  X  t over topics is sampled from Dirichlet  X  , and each topic is associated with a multinomial distribution  X  z sampled from Dirichlet  X  over description words of a resource for that topic. The generating probability of word w for tag t of a resource r is given in Eq. 9. In TT model, both words and tags of a resource are modeled together to get their com-bined influence. It assumes that description words can be real representatives of tags. In its generative process, it considers that words of a resource are responsible for generat-ing some topics which in turn gener ates the tags for that resource. User-Tag-Topic Model (UTT). Recently, Author-Topic mode l is extended to model au-thors and conferences simultaneously by using latent topics, named Author-Conference-Topic Model (ACT) [14]. Its variation is pro vided by [8], in which each description word is represented by the probability distribution description over topics, and each topic is represented as a probability distribution over tags and users for each word of a resource for that topic. The generative probability of the tag t with user u for word w of resource r is given as: In UTT, words, tags and users are modeled t ogether to get their combined influence, with assumption that all three components a re interdependent and should be modeled together. In its generative process, it considers that words of a resource are responsible for generating some topics which in turn gen erates the tags and user for that resource. 3.3 Hybrid Approaches We propose two di ff erent approaches to recommend tags: keyword based approach (KBA) and topic modeling based approach (TMBA). These two approaches focus on two di ff erent aspects. KBA will recommend some keywords extracted from the can-didate set while TMBA tends to recommend some conceptual knowledge as tags. In detail, LM can only model word specific information and cannot model the topic infor-mation. LDA models can be used to model the topic distributions of documents, which eliminates the limitation of LM. Consequently, the combination of LM and LDA is an necessary and intuitive better way to im prove tag recommendation performance.
Thus, in our hybrid method, we will select and recommend top k ranked tags from aggregation of KBA and TMBA: where  X  ( r , t )  X  [0,1] is the probability of a tag for the specific resource by KBA and  X  ( r , t )  X  [0,1] is the probability of a tag for the specific resource by TMBA.  X  is an aggregation function used to combing the e ff ects of KBA and TMBA, which should observe the following axioms.
 Axiom 1 Fo r a t a g t and a resource r , Axiom 2 Fo r a t a g t and a resource r , function  X  should guarantee  X  ( r , t )  X  [0,1]. Axiom 3 For a resource r ,twotagst 1 and t 2 . Axiom 1 specifies the boundary cases of the probability. When  X  ( r , t ) = 0, it means that atag t is in the training file but not in the candidate set of KBA. Thus,  X  ( r , t ) should be function  X  should constrain  X  ( r , t )  X  [0,1]. Axiom 3 shows the interrelationship between KBA and TMBA. The aggregation  X  is application-dependent [21]. The choice of ag-gregation function  X  in a specific application is out of the scope of this paper 5 . In our paper, we present a possible function as an example to aggregate KBA and TMBA. where  X  is a weight to balance KBA and TMBA.

Based on these foundations mentioned-above, we propose several hybrid approaches for tag recommendation on the basis of K BA and TMBA. We instance the KBA as LM and TMBA as LDA, TT and UTT, respectively. Therefore, We consider several forms of combination including wLM + wLDA (Eq.13), wLM + tLDA (Eq.14), wLM + TT (Eq.15), wLM + UTT (Eq.16), tLM + wLDA (Eq.21), tLM + tLDA (Eq.18), tLM + TT (Eq.19) and tLM + UTT (Eq.20).
 where P wLM ( t | r )and P tLM ( t | r ) is the generating probability of word w and tag t from is the probability of word w or tag t from resource r obtained by the LDA model (as defined in Eq.7 and Eq.8), P(w | t,r,  X  ,  X  ) is the generating probability of word w for tag t of resource r . 4.1 Experimental Settings Data sets. Bibsonomy is a social tagging tool which allows user to manage a personal collection of links to the websites and describe those links with one or more words. We selected a subset of Bibsonomy dataset provided by ECML / PKDD 2008 organizers for Discovery Challenge. There are 33,256 words, 13,276 tags, 1,185 users, 14,443 re-sources and 262,445 bookmarks in total. We then preprocessed dataset by a) removing stop-words, punctuations and numbers, b) lower-casing the obtained words, tags, user names and c) removing words and tags that appear less than three times in the cor-pus. This creates 18,450 words, 10,702 tags, 861 users, 13,179 resources and 181,491 bookmarks in the dataset. Baseline Approaches. We conducted experiments on Bibsonomy dataset to evaluate the recommendation quality of proposed hybrid and non-hybrid approaches using top-k recommendations metric. We use wLM , tLM , CombLM , wLDA , tLDA , TT ,and UTT as the baseline methods.
 Parameter settings. For keyword based methods we used  X  = 10, as using di ff erent val-ues does not have any impact on the performance. For topic modeling methods, one can estimate the optimal values of hyper-parameters  X  ,  X  and  X  by using Expectation Maxi-mization (EM) method [22] or Gibbs sampling algorithm [23]. EM algorithm is suscep-tible to local maxima and computationally ine ffi cient [12]. Consequently, Gibbs sam-pling algorithm is fit to use. In our experiments, for 100 topics z the hyper-parameters  X  ,  X  and  X  weresetat50 / z, 0.01 and 0.1, respectively, by following values used in [14]. The number of topics z was fixed at 100 on the basis of human judgment of meaningful topics plus measured perplexity [24,25] on held out test dataset for di ff erent number of topics z from 20 to 200. For combination, we set  X  = 0.15.
 Evaluation Measure. Our ultimate goal is to measure the e ff ectiveness of suggesting top-ranked tags for a resource to a user. Thus, to fairly compare their performance, we employ the top-k recommendations performance measure. That is, each ranking algorithm needs to recommend the top k tags to a resource. This evaluation method is used for community recommendation using LDA by Chen et al [26], in which they ranked randomly withhold communities and recommended top k communities. 4.2 Results and Discussions Topic Related Tags for Resources. We recommend tags with respect to specific kind of resources on the basis of topic layer. Table 1 illustrates 4 di ff erent topic related tags out of 100 by LM combined with LDA, discovered from the 1000th iteration of the particular Gibbs sampler run. Each topic shows top 10 tags that are most likely to be produced for topic related resources. The ta gs associated with each topic are quite in-tuitive and precise in the sense of conveying a semantic summary of a specific kind of resources. One can see that top ranked tags for di ff erent topics are quite informative. For example, in case of topic Internet Security , all tags are semantically related and show that resources will have some information about internet security issues. Similarly top-ics Music , Semantic Web and Browser Extension have tags that are real representatives of specific kind of resources. Our proposed approach discovers several other topics related to folksonomy , graphics , data mining , web services , web tools , java , book mark-ing , business , jobs and also other topics that span th e full range of areas encompassed in the dataset. The discovered tag results can be used to suggest meaningful tags for re-sources and to solve cold start problem by pr edicting tags, when a user wants to tag new resources to speed up the tagging process by suggesting several tags for each resource. Top-k Recommendations. In Table 2, we show the performance of proposed ap-proaches and baseline methods, which includes words based, tags based and combined methods. We can see that LM approaches perform better than others, the hybrid ap-proaches is better than non-hybrid approaches except LM. The best average ranking accuracy ( k = 2,4,6,8, and 10) of hybrid approach, wLM + tLDA is 65% that is 5% less than the best LM approach, wLM, 70%. We can see that better results can be ob-tained when keyword and topic layer based approaches are combined to build hybrid approaches. Hybrid approaches having fewer entities, such as wLM + tLDA, tLM + tLDA, perform better, while hybrid appro aches modeling more entities, e.g. tLM + TT and tLM + UTT, perform worse than others. It shows that the performance can be in-creased when keyword and topic layer based methods for words or tags are combined, though LM as individual is still the best. It is assumed that words of resources generate tags of resources in TT approach, and words of resources simultaneously generate tags and users who tagged the resources in UTT approach. We can see that wLDA (55%) and tLDA (57%) perform better than both TT (52%) and UTT (47%), and TT performs better than UTT. It also shows that additional information used for tag recommendation results in poor performance for topic layer based approach, such as users, words and tags are modeled together in case of UTT, and words and tags are modeled together in case of TT. When tLM is combined with wLM, only 60% accuracy is obtained which is lower than that of the original accuracy obtained by tLM (68% ) and wLM (70%). That means the hybridization is not useful when both approaches are keyword based ones in the hybrid.
 Correlation between Resources. Hybrid approaches can be used for automatic cor-relation discovery between resources, including keyword and topic layer based ap-proaches influence, simultaneously. Discovered correlations can be utilized to recom-mend resources to the users with similar interests. To illustrate how it can be used in this respect, the distance between resources i and j is defined as symmetric KL (sKL) divergence [27] between the topic distrib utions conditioned on each of the resource distribution as: where  X  iz and  X  jz are the probability of topic z in resource i and resource j , respectively.
We calculated the dissimilarity between the resources by using Eq.21. The smaller dissimilarity value means the higher correlation between resources. Table 3 shows semantic-based correlation of resource Macintosh which is Google desktop download for Mac and tagged by mac 07 system applications bar interface . Here, it is obligatory to mention that top 10 resources related to resource Macintosh are not the necessary resources which are tagged by similar users, but rather the resources that tend to pro-duce most tags or words for the same topics. Again the results are quite promising and realistic as most of the resources related to resource Macintosh are also topic related. This study deals with the problem of tag recommendation using several hybrid and non-hybrid approaches. The approaches are proposed by combining keyword based (no-semantics) and topic layer (semantics) based approaches. In our experiments the per-formance di ff erence between words and tags based approaches, e.g. tLDA and wLDA, is not very di ff erent. Although tLDA is a bit better than wLDA but we can say that both description words and tags can be a good choice for tagging resources. We find that combination of keyword and topic lay er based approaches is significantly e ff ective in many cases when there are fewer entities are modeled in topic model. The proposed ap-proaches are simple, but the experiments show that they produced quite intuitive results. We also show that the performance decreases if the number of entities (e.g. words, tags and users) is simultaneously modeled in topic layer based approach. Moreover, through using our approaches, the correlations between the resources can be identified quite precisely.
