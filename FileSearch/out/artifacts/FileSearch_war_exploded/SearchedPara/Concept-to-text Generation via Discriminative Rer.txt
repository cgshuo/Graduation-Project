 Concept-to-text generation broadly refers to the task of automatically producing textual output from non-linguistic input such as databases of records, logical form, and expert system knowledge bases (Reiter and Dale, 2000). A variety of concept-to-text generation systems have been engineered over the years, with considerable success (e.g., Dale et al. (2003), Reiter et al. (2005), Green (2006), Turner et al. (2009)). Unfortunately, it is often difficult to adapt them across different domains as they rely mostly on handcrafted components.

In this paper we present a data-driven ap-proach to concept-to-text generation that is domain-independent, conceptually simple, and flexible. Our generator learns from a set of database records and textual descriptions (for some of them). An exam-ple from the air travel domain is shown in Figure 1. Here, the records provide a structured representation of the flight details (e.g., departure and arrival time, location), and the text renders some of this infor-mation in natural language. Given such input, our model determines which records to talk about ( con-tent selection ) and which words to use for describing them ( surface realization ). Rather than breaking up the generation process into a sequence of local deci-sions, we perform both tasks jointly. A key insight in our approach is to reduce content selection and surface realization into a common parsing problem. Specifically, we define a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) that captures the structure of the database and its correspondence to natural language. This grammar represents multiple derivations which we encode compactly using a weighted hypergraph (or packed forest), a data structure that defines a weight for each tree.

Following a generative approach, we could first learn the weights of the PCFG by maximising the joint likelihood of the model and then perform gen-eration by finding the best derivation tree in the hy-pergraph. The performance of this baseline system could be potentially further improved using discrim-inative reranking (Collins, 2000). Typically, this method first creates a list of n -best candidates from a generative model, and then reranks them with arbi-trary features (both local and global) that are either not computable or intractable to compute within the baseline system.

An appealing alternative is to rerank the hyper-graph directly (Huang, 2008). As it compactly en-codes exponentially many derivations, we can ex-plore a much larger hypothesis space than would have been possible with an n -best list. Importantly, in this framework non-local features are computed at all internal hypergraph nodes, allowing the de-coder to take advantage of them continuously at all stages of the generation process. We incorporate features that are local with respect to a span of a sub-derivation in the packed forest; we also (approx-imately) include features that arbitrarily exceed span boundaries, thus capturing more global knowledge. Experimental results on the A TIS domain (Dahl et al., 1994) demonstrate that our model outperforms a baseline based on the best derivation and a state-of-the-art discriminative system (Angeli et al., 2010) by a wide margin.

Our contributions in this paper are threefold: we recast concept-to-text generation in a probabilistic parsing framework that allows to jointly optimize content selection and surface realization; we repre-sent parse derivations compactly using hypergraphs and illustrate the use of an algorithm for generating (rather than parsing) in this framework; finally, the application of discriminative reranking to concept-to-text generation is novel to our knowledge and as our experiments show beneficial. Early discriminative approaches to text generation were introduced in spoken dialogue systems, and usually tackled content selection and surface re-alization separately. Ratnaparkhi (2002) concep-tualized surface realization (from a fixed meaning representation) as a classification task. Local and non-local information (e.g., word n -grams, long-range dependencies) was taken into account with the use of features in a maximum entropy probability model. More recently, Wong and Mooney (2007) describe an approach to surface realization based on synchronous context-free grammars. The latter are learned using a log-linear model with minimum er-ror rate training (Och, 2003).

Angeli et al. (2010) were the first to propose a unified approach to content selection and surface re-alization. Their model operates over automatically induced alignments of words to database records (Liang et al., 2009) and decomposes into a sequence of discriminative local decisions. They first deter-mine which records in the database to talk about, then which fields of those records to mention, and finally which words to use to describe the chosen fields. Each of these decisions is implemented as a log-linear model with features learned from train-ing data. Their surface realization component per-forms decisions based on templates that are automat-ically extracted and smoothed with domain-specific knowledge in order to guarantee fluent output.
Discriminative reranking has been employed in many NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing (Char-niak and Johnson, 2005; Huang, 2008), machine translation (Shen et al., 2004; Li and Khudanpur, 2009) and semantic parsing (Ge and Mooney, 2006). Our model is closest to Huang (2008) who also performs forest reranking on a hypergraph, using both local and non-local features, whose weights are tuned with the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002). We adapt forest reranking to gen-eration and introduce several task-specific features that boost performance. Although conceptually re-lated to Angeli et al. (2010), our model optimizes content selection and surface realization simultane-ously, rather than as a sequence. The discriminative aspect of two models is also fundamentally different. We have a single reranking component that applies throughout, whereas they train different discrimina-tive models for each local decision. We assume our generator takes as input a set of database records d and produces text w that verbal-izes some of these records. Each record r  X  d has a type r . t and a set of fields f associated with it. Fields have different values f . v and types f . t (i.e., integer or categorical). For example, in Figure 1, flight is a record type with fields from and to . The values of these fields are denver and boston and their type is categorical.

During training, our algorithm is given a corpus consisting of several scenarios , i.e., database records paired with texts like those shown in Figure 1. The database (and accompanying texts) are next con-verted into a PCFG whose weights are learned from training data. PCFG derivations are represented as a weighted directed hypergraph (Gallo et al., 1993). The weights on the hyperarcs are defined by a vari-ety of feature functions, which we learn via a dis-criminative online update algorithm. During test-ing, we are given a set of database records with-out the corresponding text. Using the learned fea-ture weights, we compile a hypergraph specific to this test input and decode it approximately (Huang, 2008). The hypergraph representation allows us to decompose the feature functions and compute them piecemeal at each hyperarc (or sub-derivation), rather than at the root node as in conventional n -best list reranking. Note that the algorithm does not sep-arate content selection from surface realization, both subtasks are optimized jointly through the proba-bilistic parsing formulation. 3.1 Grammar Definition We capture the structure of the database with a num-ber of CFG rewrite rules, in a similar way to how Liang et al. (2009) define Markov chains in their hierarchical model. These rules are purely syn-tactic (describing the intuitive relationship between records, records and fields, fields and corresponding words), and could apply to any database with sim-ilar structure irrespectively of the semantics of the domain.
 Our grammar is defined in Table 1 (rules (1) X (9)). Rule weights are governed by an underlying multi-nomial distribution and are shown in square brack-ets. Non-terminal symbols are in capitals and de-note intermediate states; the terminal symbol  X  corresponds to all words seen in the training set, and g( f . v ) is a function for generating integer num-bers given the value of a field f . All non-terminals, save the start symbol S, have one or more constraints (shown in parentheses), similar to number and gen-der agreement constraints in augmented syntactic rules.

Rule (1) denotes the expansion from the start symbol S to record R, which has the special start type (hence the notation R ( start ) ). Rule (2) de-fines a chain between two consecutive records r i and r j . Here, FS ( r j , start ) represents the set of fields of the target r j , following the source record R ( r i ) . For example, the rule R ( search 1 . t )  X  FS ( f light 1 , start ) R ( f light 1 . t ) can be interpreted as follows. Given that we have talked about search 1 , we will next talk about f light 1 and thus emit its corresponding fields. R ( f light 1 . t ) is a non-terminal place-holder for the continuation of the chain of records, and start in FS is a special boundary field between consecutive records. The weight of this rule is the bigram probability of two records conditioned on their type, multiplied with a normalization fac-tor  X  . We have also defined a null record type i.e., a record that has no fields and acts as a smoother for words that may not correspond to a particular record. Rule (3) is simply an escape rule, so that the parsing process (on the record level) can finish.

Rule (4) is the equivalent of rule (2) at the field level, i.e., it describes the chaining of two con-secutive fields f i and f j . Non-terminal F ( r , r . f ) refers to field f of record r . For example, the rule FS ( f light 1 , f rom )  X  F ( f light 1 , to ) FS ( f light specifies that we should talk about the field to of record f light 1 , after talking about the field f rom . Analogously to the record level, we have also in-cluded a special null field type for the emission of words that do not correspond to a specific record field. Rule (6) defines the expansion of field F to a sequence of (binarized) words W, with a weight equal to the bigram probability of the current word given the previous word, the current record, and field.

Rules (8) and (9) define the emission of words and integer numbers from W, given a field type and its value. Rule (8) emits a single word from the vocabu-lary of the training set. Its weight defines a multino-mial distribution over all seen words, for every value of field f , given that the field type is categorical or the special null field. Rule (9) is identical but for fields whose type is integer. Function g( f . v ) gener-ates an integer number given the field value, using either of the following six ways (Liang et al., 2009): identical to the field value, rounding up or rounding down to a multiple of 5, rounding off to the clos-est multiple of 5 and finally adding or subtracting some unexplained noise. 1 The weight is a multino-mial over the six generation function modes , given the record field f .

The CFG in Table 1 will produce many deriva-tions for a given input (i.e., a set of database records) which we represent compactly using a hypergraph or a packed forest (Klein and Manning, 2001; Huang, 2008). Simplified examples of this representation are shown in Figure 2. 3.2 Hypergraph Reranking For our generation task, we are given a set of database records d , and our goal is to find the best corresponding text w . This corresponds to the best grammar derivation among a set of candidate deriva-tions represented implicitly in the hypergraph struc-ture. As shown in Table 1, the mapping from d to w is unknown. Therefore, all the intermediate multino-mial distributions, described in the previous section, define a hidden correspondence structure h , between records, fields, and their values. We find the best Algorithm 1: Averaged Structured Perceptron scoring derivation (  X  w ,  X  h ) by maximizing over con-figurations of h : We define the score of (  X  w ,  X  h ) as the dot product between a high dimensional feature representation  X  = (  X  1 ,...,  X  m ) and a weight vector  X  .

We estimate the weights  X  using the averaged structured perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002), which is well known for its speed and good perfor-mance in similar large-parameter NLP tasks (Liang et al., 2006; Huang, 2008). As shown in Algo-rithm 1, the perceptron makes several passes over the training scenarios, and in each iteration it com-putes the best scoring (  X  w ,  X  h ) among the candidate derivations, given the current weights  X  . In line 6, the algorithm updates  X  with the difference (if any) between the feature representations of the best scor-ing derivation (  X  w ,  X  h ) and the the oracle derivation ( w  X  , h + ) . Here,  X  w is the estimated text, w  X  the gold-standard text,  X  h is the estimated latent configuration of the model and h + the oracle latent configuration. The final weight vector  X  is the average of weight vectors over T iterations and N scenarios. This av-eraging procedure avoids overfitting and produces more stable results (Collins, 2002).

In the following, we first explain how we decode in this framework, i.e., find the best scoring deriva-tion (Section 3.3) and discuss our definition for the oracle derivation ( w  X  , h + ) (Section 3.4). Our fea-tures are described in Section 4.2. 3.3 Hypergraph Decoding Following Huang (2008), we also distinguish fea-tures into local, i.e., those that can be computed within the confines of a single hyperedge, and non-local, i.e., those that require the prior visit of nodes other than their antecedents. For example, the Alignment feature in Figure 2(a) is local, and thus can be computed a priori, but the Word Trigrams is not; in Figure 2(b) words in parentheses are sub-generations created so far at each word node; their combination gives rise to the trigrams serving as input to the feature. However, this combination may not take place at their immediate ancestors, since these may not be adjacent nodes in the hy-pergraph. According to the grammar in Table 1, there is no direct hyperedge between nodes repre-senting words (W) and nodes representing the set of fields these correspond to (FS); rather, W and FS are connected implicitly via individual fields (F). Note, that in order to estimate the trigram feature at the FS node, we need to carry word information in the derivations of its antecedents, as we go bottom-up. 2
Given these two types of features, we can then adapt Huang X  X  (2008) approximate decoding algo-rithm to find (  X  w ,  X  h ) . Essentially, we perform bottom-up Viterbi search, visiting the nodes in reverse topo-logical order, and keeping the k -best derivations for each. The score of each derivation is a linear com-bination of local and non-local features weights. In machine translation, a decoder that implements for-est rescoring (Huang and Chiang, 2007) uses the lan-guage model as an external criterion of the good-ness of sub-translations on account of their gram-maticality. Analogously here, non-local features in-fluence the selection of the best combinations, by introducing knowledge that exceeds the confines of the node under consideration and thus depend on the sub-derivations generated so far. (e.g., word tri-grams spanning a field node rely on evidence from antecedent nodes that may be arbitrarily deeper than the field X  X  immediate children).

Our treatment of leaf nodes (see rules (8) and (9)) differs from the way these are usually handled in parsing. Since in generation we must emit rather than observe the words, for each leaf node we there-fore output the k -best words according to the learned weights  X  of the Alignment feature (see Sec-tion 4.2), and continue building our sub-generations bottom-up. This generation task is far from triv-ial: the search space on the word level is the size of the vocabulary and each field of a record can poten-tially generate all words. Also, note that in decoding it is useful to have a way to score different output lengths | w | . Rather than setting w to a fixed length, we rely on a linear regression predictor that uses the counts of each record type per scenario as features and is able to produce variable length texts. 3.4 Oracle Derivation So far we have remained agnostic with respect to the oracle derivation ( w  X  , h + ) . In other NLP tasks such as syntactic parsing, there is a gold-standard parse, that can be used as the oracle. In our gener-ation setting, such information is not available. We do not have the gold-standard alignment between the database records and the text that verbalizes them. Instead, we approximate it using the existing de-coder to find the best latent configuration h + given the observed words in the training text w  X  . 3 This is similar in spirit to the generative alignment model of Liang et al. (2009). In this section we present our experimental setup for assessing the performance of our model. We give details on our dataset, model parameters and fea-tures, the approaches used for comparison, and ex-plain how system output was evaluated. 4.1 Dataset We conducted our experiments on the Air Travel In-formation System ( A TIS ) dataset (Dahl et al., 1994) which consists of transcriptions of spontaneous ut-terances of users interacting with a hypothetical on-line flight booking system. The dataset was orig-inally created for the development of spoken lan-guage systems and is partitioned in individual user turns (e.g., flights from orlando to milwaukee , show flights from orlando to milwaukee leaving after six o X  X lock ) each accompanied with an SQL query to a booking system and the results of this query. These utterances are typically short expressing a specific communicative goal (e.g., a question about the ori-gin of a flight or its time of arrival). This inevitably results in small scenarios with a few words that of-ten unambiguously correspond to a single record. To avoid training our model on a somewhat trivial cor-pus, we used the dataset introduced in Zettlemoyer and Collins (2007) instead, which combines the ut-terances of a single user in one scenario and con-tains 5,426 scenarios in total; each scenario corre-sponds to a (manually annotated) formal meaning representation (  X  -expression) and its translation in natural language.

Lambda expressions were automatically con-verted into records, fields and values following the conventions adopted in Liang et al. (2009). 4 Given a lambda expression like the one shown in Figure 1, we first create a record for each variable and constant (e.g., x , 9 , august ). We then assign record types ac-cording to the corresponding class types (e.g., vari-able x has class type flight ). Next, fields and val-ues are added from predicates with two arguments with the class type of the first argument matching that of the record type. The name of the predicate denotes the field, and the second argument denotes the value. We also defined special record types, such as condition and search . The latter is introduced for every lambda operator and assigned the categorical field what with the value flight which refers to the record type of variable x .

Contrary to datasets used in previous generation studies (e.g., R OBO C UP (Chen and Mooney, 2008) much richer vocabulary (927 words); each scenario corresponds to a single sentence (average length is 11.2 words) with 2.65 out of 19 record types mentioned on average. Following Zettlemoyer and Collins (2007), we trained on 4,962 scenarios and tested on A TIS NOV93 which contains 448 examples. 4.2 Features Broadly speaking, we defined two types of features, namely lexical and structural ones. In addition, we used a generatively trained PCFG as a baseline feature and an alignment feature based on the co-occurrence of records (or fields) with words. Baseline Feature This is the log score of a gen-erative decoder trained on the PCFG from Table 1. We converted the grammar into a hypergraph, and learned its probability distributions using a dynamic program similar to the inside-outside algorithm (Li and Eisner, 2009). Decoding was performed approx-imately via cube pruning (Chiang, 2007), by inte-grating a trigram language model extracted from the training set (see Konstas and Lapata (2012) for de-tails). Intuitively, the feature refers to the overall goodness of a specific derivation, applied locally in every hyperedge.
 Alignment Features Instances of this feature fam-ily refer to the count of each PCFG rule from Ta-ble 1. For example, the number of times rule R ( search 1 . t )  X  FS ( f light 1 , start ) R ( f light cluded in a derivation (see Figure 2(a)) Lexical Features These features encourage gram-matical coherence and inform lexical selection over and above the limited horizon of the language model captured by Rules (6) X (9). They also tackle anoma-lies in the generated output, due to the ergodicity of the CFG rules at the record and field level: Word Bigrams/Trigrams This is a group of non-local feature functions that count word n -grams at every level in the hypergraph (see Figure 2(b)). The integration of words in the sub-derivations is adapted from Chiang (2007).
 Number of Words per Field This feature function counts the number of words for every field, aiming to capture compound proper nouns and multi-word expressions, e.g., fields from and to frequently corre-spond to two or three words such as  X  new york  X  and  X  salt lake city  X  (see Figure 2(d)).
 Consecutive Word/Bigram/Trigram This feature family targets adjacent repetitions of the same word, bigram or trigram, e.g.,  X  show me the show me the flights  X .
 Structural Features Features in this category tar-get primarily content selection and influence appro-priate choice at the field level: Field bigrams/trigrams Analogously to the lexical features mentioned above, we introduce a series of non-local features that capture field n -grams, given a specific record. For example the record flight in the air travel domain typically has the values &lt; from to &gt; (see Figure 2(c)). The integration of fields in sub-derivations is implemented in fashion similar to the integration of words.
 Number of Fields per Record This feature family is a coarser version of the Field bigrams/trigrams feature, which is deemed to be sparse for rarely-seen records.
 Field with No Value Although records in the A TIS database schema have many fields, only a few are assigned a value in any given scenario. For exam-ple, the flight record has 13 fields, of which only 1.7 (on average) have a value. Practically, in a genera-tive model this kind of sparsity would result in very low field recall. We thus include an identity feature function that explicitly counts whether a particular field has a value. 4.3 Evaluation We evaluated three configurations of our model. A system that only uses the top scor-ing derivation in each sub-generation and in-corporates only the baseline and alignment features (1-BEST + BASE + ALIGN ). Our sec-ond system considers the k -best derivations and additionally includes lexical features ( k -BEST + BASE + ALIGN + LEX ). The number of k -best derivations was set to 40 and estimated experimentally on held-out data. And finally, our third system includes the full feature set the second and third system incorporate non-local features, hence the use of k -best derivation lists. We compared our model to Angeli et al. (2010) whose approach is closest to ours. 6
We evaluated system output automatically, using the BLEU-4 modified precision score (Papineni et al., 2002) with the human-written text as reference. We also report results with the METEOR score (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), which takes into ac-count word re-ordering and has been shown to cor-relate better with human judgments at the sentence level. In addition, we evaluated the generated text by eliciting human judgments. Participants were pre-sented with a scenario and its corresponding verbal-ization (see Figure 3) and were asked to rate the lat-ter along two dimensions: fluency (is the text gram-matical and overall understandable?) and semantic correctness (does the meaning conveyed by the text correspond to the database input?). The subjects used a five point rating scale where a high number indicates better performance. We randomly selected 12 documents from the test set and generated out-put with two of our models (1-BEST + BASE + ALIGN et al. X  X  (2010) model. We also included the original text (H UMAN ) as a gold standard. We thus obtained ratings for 48 (12  X  4) scenario-text pairs. The study was conducted over the Internet, using Amazon Me-chanical Turk, and was completed by 51 volunteers, all self reported native English speakers. Table 2 summarizes our results. As can be seen, in-clusion of lexical features gives our decoder an ab-solute increase of 6.73% in BLEU over the 1-BEST system. It also outperforms the discriminative sys-tem of Angeli et al. (2010). Our lexical features seem more robust compared to their templates. This is especially the case with infrequent records, where their system struggles to learn any meaningful infor-mation. Addition of the structural features further boosts performance. Our model increases by 8.69% System BLEU METEOR 1-k -k -A NGELI 26.77 42.41 over the 1-BEST system and 3.85% over ANGELI in terms of BLEU. We observe a similar trend when evaluating system output with METEOR. Differ-ences in magnitude are larger with the latter metric.
The results of our human evaluation study are shown in Table 5. We carried out an Analysis of Variance (A NOVA ) to examine the effect of system type (1-BEST , k -BEST , A NGELI , and H UMAN ) on the fluency and semantic correctness ratings. Means differences were compared using a post-hoc Tukey test. The k -BEST system is significantly better than the 1-BEST and A NGELI ( a &lt; 0 . 01) both in terms of fluency and semantic correctness. A NGELI is significantly better than 1-BEST with regard to flu-ency ( a &lt; 0 . 05) but not semantic correctness. There is no statistically significant difference between the k -BEST output and the original sentences ( HUMAN ). Examples of system output are shown in Table 3. They broadly convey similar meaning with the gold-standard; ANGELI exhibits some long-range repeti-tion, probably due to re-iteration of the same record patterns. We tackle this issue with the inclusion of non-local structural features. The 1-BEST system has some grammaticality issues, which we avoid by defining features over lexical n -grams and repeated words. It is worth noting that both our system and A
NGELI produce output that is semantically com-patible with but lexically different from the gold-standard (compare please list the flights and show me the flights against give me the flights ). This is expected given the size of the vocabulary, but raises concerns regarding the use of automatic metrics for the evaluation of generation output. We presented a discriminative reranking framework for an end-to-end generation system that performs both content selection and surface realization. Cen-tral to our approach is the encoding of generation as a parsing problem. We reformulate the input (a set of database records and text describing some of
System Fluency SemCor A NGELI 3.74 3.17 H UMAN 4.18 4.02 them) as a PCFG and convert it to a hypergraph. We find the best scoring derivation via forest reranking using both local and non-local features, that we train using the perceptron algorithm. Experimental eval-uation on the A TIS dataset shows that our model at-tains significantly higher fluency and semantic cor-rectness than any of the comparison systems. The current model can be easily extended to incorporate, additional, more elaborate features. Likewise, it can port to other domains with similar database struc-ture without modification, such as W EATHER G OV and R OBO C UP . Finally, distributed training strate-gies have been developed for the perceptron algo-rithm (McDonald et al., 2010), which would allow our generator to scale to even larger datasets.
In the future, we would also like to tackle more challenging domains (e.g., product descriptions) and to enrich our generator with some notion of dis-course planning. An interesting question is how to extend the PCFG-based approach advocated here so as to capture discourse-level document structure.
