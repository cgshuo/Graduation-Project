 wikiSearch, is a search engine customized for the Wikipedia corpus but with design features th at may be generalized to other search systems. Its features enhance basic functionality and enable more fluid interactivity while supporting both workflow in the search process and the experimental process used in lab testing. H.3.3 [Information Storage and Re trieval]: Information Search and Retrieval Keywords : Wikipedia, search systems, interactive search. wikiSearch was designed to overc ome a number of problems that we observed using experiencing while doing interactive search, and to enable a more fluid search workflow process. Our core design challenges included removi ng the labyrinth approach to search, providing easily accessible views of prior activity, and providing a simple organizational tool for capturing results and implementing lab experimentation. wikiSearch runs on Lucene 2.2, an open source search engine using the vector space model. The Wikipedia XML documents are indexed with the Lucene standard analyzer, using its default stemming and stop word filtering. Each resulting  X  X ocument X  is composed of two fields, one holding the title and the other handling the rest of the contents. The heart of wikiSearch is its customized, robust interface and back-end written using a combination of server-side PHP, and client-side Javascript. Through PH P, we capture data regarding any standard, static user interacti ons and using Ajax allows for the capturing instantaneous or dynamic interactions. Using a MySQL database and web-based data access page, the results are immediately available and easily traversable. To remove the labyrinth effect of layering multiple pages typically found in commercial s earch engines we developed a simple single interface divided into three logical  X  X rames X  as illustrated: 1. Page Display (extreme right) contains a scrollable wiki content page that also contains ordina ry hypertext links and links to search within the wiki. In addition, each page contains a list of Suggested Pages which is created by entering the entire first paragraph of the page displayed as a search string, and occurs on-the-fly as that page is loaded. It has the potential to provide more specific pages about the topic, or to be distracting, offering opportunistic or serendipitous items. Each page view is loaded by clicking on a link from one of the other three features: Search Results , History or Bookbag . Pages may also be blocked so that they are not viewed again for this search task. 2. Search section contains the core search tools including a typical searchbox. To conserve space, the Results section contains only page titles; a m ouseover provides brief word-in-context summaries. Below the results is a History section that lists both past queries and past pages viewed. A query may be re-issued or a page re-viewed from this section which expands (with scroll bars) as the content in history increases. experimental task which prompt s participants for the assigned task, and is analogous to the real world task assignment, and b) the Bookbag , akin to the shopping cart used by e-commerce, is used to collect pages deemed useful to the task by participants. While browser bookmarks enable the identification of useful websites, they are not designed for quick on the fly decisions that may concern a one-time task. Pages can be removed from the Bookbag; and are rated in the B ookbag for relevance assessment. Pages may be added to the Bookba g from the Page Display, the Search Results, and/or the History sections. wikiSearch has now been used by 500 people in two significant interactive search experiments. Multiple positive user comments reagarding its simple  X  X ird X  X  eye view X  of the search. A version is accessible at: http://www.interactiveIR.org/public/.
