 We demonstrate a system that supports the visual explo-ration of collaboration networks. The system leverages the notion of fractional cores introduced in earlier work to rank vertices in a collaboration network and filter vertices X  neigh-borhoods. Fractional cores build on the idea of graph degen-eracy as captured by the notion of k -cores in graph theory and extend it to undirected edge-weighted graphs. In a co-authorship network, for instance, the fractional core index of an author intuitively reflects the degree of collaboration with equally or higher-ranked authors. Our system has been deployed on a real-world co-authorship network derived from DBLP, demonstrating that the idea of fractional cores can be applied even to large-scale networks. The system provides an easy-to-use interface to query for the fractional core index of an author, to see who the closest equally or higher-ranked co-authors are, and explore the entire co-authorship network in an incremental manner.

 Collaboration networks, graph degeneracy, fractional cores. specifically, in our case the visualization depicts the neigh-bors of authors in the DBLP co-authorship network that are inside the highest index core they belong to. This implies that the appearing co-authors is the subset of all coauthors that also belong to the current or better k -core. Thus these authors are those that are at least as collaborative as the one we are concerned. Therefore this graph is the best co-authorship community of the author bearing as well weights on the edges. These edges indicate the amount of the co-authorship effort shared among the authors at the ends of the edge.
 Organization. The rest of this paper unfolds as follows: In Section 2, we describe the concept of fractional cores and explain how it can be used to rank and filter vertices in collaboration networks. Section 3 describes the architecture of our system. Our demo is outlined in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 lays out other potential application scenarios.
We now describe the notion of fractional cores and explain how it can be used to rank and filter vertices in a collabora-tion network.

Collaboration Networks are formally represented as follows: Consider a bipartite graph where A is the set of authors, P is the set of papers, and E is a set of edges. Each edge { x,y } (where x  X  A and y  X  P ) expresses the fact that x is one of the authors of paper y . We also assume that all papers are written by at least two authors. This is a safe assumption, given that single-author papers can be ignored for our application. Given G , we construct an edge-weighted graph ( H G , w ) whose vertex set is A and where an edge connects two authors if and only if they appear as co-authors in at least one paper. We call ( H
G , w ) the co-authorship graph of G . The mere existence of some edge H G does not convey how intensively the two authors have collaborated in the past. Therefore, we set up a weighing function w that assigns a weight w ( e ) on each edge e = { x,x 0 } of H G according to the following scheme: where N G ( x ) is the set of neighbors in G of the vertex x , i.e., the set of papers that were authored by x . Notice that in the above formula, we implicitly assume that all authors of a paper have put equal effort in its preparation. Given that we have assigned a weight to each of the edges of G , we can extend the notion of the degree of a vertex x by defining:
Fractional k -Cores. Let Q + be the set of all positive rational numbers. Given a k  X  Q , we define the fractional k -core of ( H G , w ) as the maximum size subgraph of H such that for each of its vertices, the sum of the weights of its incident edges is no smaller than k . It is easy to prove that this graph is unique. For this reason it can be computed easily by discarding from H G vertices of fractional degree less than k until no such vertices exist anymore. We refer to this procedure as the Trim procedure. For more details and of its fractional core index and its hop-1 neighborhood con-sisting of immediate neighbors in the remaining graph. This information is stored in a relational database, so that it can be retrieved efficiently by our system at runtime. Note that, despite of the large scale of the DBLP co-authorship net-work, we were able to run the entire computation on a com-modity notebook equipped with a 2-core CPU and 2 GB of main memory  X  an indication that fractional cores are com-putationally lightweight and can be applied to large-scale collaboration networks.

Users interact with our system through a web-based GUI that was implemented building on the Dracula Graph javascr-pit library and can be accessed at the aforementioned URL. Its functionality, described in more detail in the following Section 4, includes showing rankings of authors by their fractional core index but also an interactive visualization of an author X  X  neighborhood, displaying only those co-authors with an equal or higher fractional core index to provide a clutter-free view on the collaboration network.
The main user interface of our system is shown in Figure 2, offering users two options to interact. On the right, a slider allows users to select a threshold on the fractional core index and browse through qualifying authors. On the left, an input box allows users to search for a specific author by name  X  both exact match and fuzzy match are supported here. Either way, once an author has been selected, the system shows the fractional core index of the author together with a visualization of the surrounding hop-1 neighborhood, i.e., the author X  X  closest co-authors who have at least an equally high fractional core index. Figure 3 shows an example hop-1 neighborhood (in this case for Michalis Vazirgiannis). From the visualization, users can see author X  X  fractional core index (here 10.6) and his  X  X ightest X  collaborators each linked with a weighted edge indicating the  X  X trength X  of their partnership.
On this initial star-like graph the user can explore the surrounding authors by clicking on the  X  X ind  X  function that appears when the mouse hovers over the author X  X  vertex. If the  X  X ncremental visualization X  option is not activated the result of the  X  X ind  X  function is a fresh star-like graph cen-tered around the newly selected author. Otherwise, if the option is activated, the user gets to explore the intersection of the two authors X  (the original and the newly selected one) strongest collaborators. This  X  X ncremental X  visualization can continue for multiple steps to reveal an increasingly broader and possibly highly interconnected community around an author. Figure 5 demonstrates this functionality building on our earlier example. Here, the star-like graph from Fig-ure 3 was expanded by selecting Timos K. Sellis from the surrounding hop-1 neighborhood of collaborators. Interest-ingly, as can be observed from the figure, there is an over-lap between the  X  X ightest X  collaborators of the two authors, Figure 4: Example of browsing the 19.6-core with the  X  X ncremental X  function activated Figure 5: Example of browsing the hop-1 neighbor-hood with the  X  X ncremental X  function activated and more senior scientists and, as a consequence, provides a clutter-free view on the candidate X  X  collaborations. Thus, collaborations that are ephemeral or with less prolific indi-viduals (e.g., students who left academia after graduating) are automatically filtered out thanks to the use of fractional cores. We foresee similar applications for human resources and team building in industry, where collaboration networks can be derived from other datasets, e.g., patents (based on the listed inventor names), e-mails (based on recipient lists) or records about who worked together on which projects in the past. We believe that a visual exploration of collabora-tion networks can also turn out insightful for other collabo-ration networks, for example, those of actors who played in the same movie (e.g., derived from a movie database such as IMDB 2 ) or politicians who co-signed a petition or partic-ipated in other joint activities.

The ideas behind our system are not limited to collab-oration networks but can be applied to any dataset from which undirected weighted graphs can be derived in a sensi-ble manner. This includes various facets of social networks with ties that signify, for instance, joint interests (based on group memberships) or reciprocal activities. Also in other contexts, the ability to visually explore large-scale datasets becomes more important in face of the ongoing data deluge. http://www.imdb.com
