 A blogosphere is a representative example of online social networks. In this paper, we address spectral analysis of a blogosphere. We model a real-world blogosphere as a ma-trix and a tensor, and then analyze it by using the SVD and PARAFAC decomposition. According to the results, the SVD successfully identified communities, each of which focuses on a specific topic, and also found hub blogs and au-thoritative posts within each community. The PARAFAC decomposition also succeeded in extracting more communi-ties of finer granules than the SVD. Also, the PARAFAC decomposition could identify the dominant keywords in ad-dition to the hub blogs and authoritative posts honored in each community.

A social network is a way of expressing a group of people within some society and the relationships among them as a network [5][8][9][10]. With the development of the Inter-net, social networks have appeared online. A blogosphere is a representative example of online social networks [12][13]. A blog is a personal website where a blogger can write his or her thoughts in posts online [4]. A blogger can perform reproductive actions on a post in someone else X  X  blog: typ-ically, trackbacks and scraps. Trackback is writing a new post A relatedtoanexistingpost B and putting a link to B within A ; Unique to blog sites in Korea, scrap is copying an existing post in someone else X  X  blog as a new post in one X  X  two vectors. Also, for space and time efficiency reasons, it is often approximated by only using R ( rank ( A )) singular values as follows.
 where  X  r (  X  1  X  2 ...  X  R &gt; 0) is one of the largest R singular values.

By using the SVD, we can uncover R most important con-cepts hidden in the relationships among N row objects and M column objects in matrix A [1]. Also, u r can be thought of as the degrees of row objects in relevance to concept r . Similarly, v r is those of column objects in relevance to con-cept r .
A tensor is a multidimensional array, a generalized ver-sion of a two-dimensional matrix [2]. Also, the PARAFAC decomposition can be considered as a higher-order gener-alization of the matrix SVD. Using the PARAFAC decom-position, an N  X  M  X  K three-way tensor is expressed by where u r  X  v r  X  w r indicates a three-way outer product.
Similar to the SVD, u r can be thought of as the strength of the first dimension objects in relevance to concept r , v r is that of the second dimension objects in relevance to concept r , and finally, w r is that of the third dimension objects in relevance to concept r [11]. The choice of R ,thenumberof concepts, is done manually in the PARAFAC decomposition.
For the analysis, we used anonymized real-world blog data which was collected from blog.naver.com , the largest blogo-sphere in Korea. From the title of every post, we extracted the non-trivial terms as its keywords . As a result, we could have information on blogs, posts, keywords, and actions as features of the blogosphere. To keep noisy keywords from being included, we eliminated stop words such as the and a . As a result, the total numbers of posts, blogs, and keywords were 1,614,242, 995,048, and 51,785, respectively. We con-verted the blog data as an N  X  M matrix A where N is the number of blogs and M is the number of posts. A ij is 1 if blog i has performed an action on post j ,and0otherwise. By using the SVD, matrix A is expressed as in Equation (2).
By applying the SVD to matrix A , we obtained following results. R ,rankof A , is six; The first six singular values in  X  r have all the energy (= sum of  X  r  X  X ) and their energy levels appear as in Figure 1. So, R indicates there are six large communities in the blogosphere. Singular vectors u r and v r give the degrees of relevance of blogs and posts to community r .Byusing u r and v r , we could identify the blogs of good hub and posts of good authority in community r .

We analyzed each of six communities in more detail. First, we examined the most frequently appearing terms in all the posts belonging to each community r . By this analysis, we also could identify the main topic dealt with in each com-munity. The first column of Table 1 shows the main topics, and the second column does four terms most frequently oc-curring in posts.
Table 3 shows, for each of the top five hub blogs in the first and second communities, the most frequently occurring terms, the respective score in u r , and the number of actions taken. Second, the blogs of high scores in u r have scraped or tackbacked a number of posts whose contents are of good quality and also highly relevant to the topic in r .Thisim-plies that these blogs are hubs in r .
 Table 3: Top five hub blogs in the first and second communities

We observe that the authoritative posts and hub blogs within the first community C1 have the titles and keywords relevant to  X  X ood recipes X , which coincides with its main topic as shown in Table 1. Similarly, we also see that the author-itative posts and hub blogs within the second community C2 are highly related to  X  X haping X  that is a main topic of the second community. In summary, the SVD successfully extracted six communities, and also found good hub blogs and good authoritative posts in each community.
We converted the blog data to an N  X  M  X  K three-way tensor B where N is the number of blogs, M is the number of posts, and K is the number of keywords. B ijk is 1 if blog i has performed an action on post j that has keyword k inside, and 0 otherwise. By using the PARAFAC decomposition, tensor B isexpressedasinEquation(3).

Vectors u r , v r ,and w r provide the degree of the relevance of blogs, posts, and keywords to community r . So, the blogs, posts, and keywords having high scores in u r , v r ,and w r are all considered inter-related to one another in community r . We set R as 10 to 50 in step of 10 in applying the PARAFAC decomposition to tensor B . Figure 2 shows the energy levels of 50 PARAFAC decomposition factors for tensor B .
Table 4 shows different sets of communities depending on thechoiceofparameter R , the number of factors in the PARAFAC decomposition, 10 through 50. Each row repre-sents a set of communities obtained by using a specific R . An entry in a row is represented by topic(i) that implies a topic and i communities related to the topic. For exam-ple, English(2) in the first row, we know that there are two communities whose members are interested in English .The Table 5: Dominant keywords, top authoritative posts, and top hub blogs in three communities

Compared to the case with the SVD, we could find more communities of finer granules with the PARAFAC decom-position by setting R to a large value.
In this paper, we have addressed the analysis of a blo-gosphere by using the SVD and PARAFAC decomposition. The SVD identified six communities from the blogosphere, and also found the blogs, posts, and keywords that are inter-related in each community. The PARAFAC decomposition worked similarly but found more communities of finer gran-ules. Possible applications of these results could be extract-
