 This special issue gathers the extended versions of 4 papers selected from the 15th International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems (NLDB 2010) which took place during June 2010 in Cardiff (UK).

Since the first edition in 1995, the NLDB 1 conference has been aiming at bringing together researchers interested in various applications of natural language processing in the databases and information system area. In order to reflect the growing importance of accessing information from a diverse collection of sources (web, databases, sensors, cloud) in an equally wide range of contexts (including mobile and tethered), the  X  Communicating with Anything, Anywhere in Natural Language  X  theme was selected for the 15th NLDB. In this open world where objects are autonomous but have to communicate, we need more than ever to take the best of natural language processing techniques to enhance contents exploitation and sharing by retrieving the semantics of the data.
 From about 70 submissions to the NLDB conference we selected 14 as full papers (acceptance rate of 23%) and 19 short papers. Following the conference, we selected 9 papers to be extended for submission to this special issue. After two rounds of reviews, from these 9 papers, 4 where eventually accepted for publication.
 The first paper, from Ishrar Hussain, Leila Kosseim and Olga Ormandjieva,  X  Approximation of COSMIC Functional Size to Support Early Effort Estimation in Agile Development Process Using Text Mining  X  provides a method for evaluating the size of a software development by text mining on its requirements. The second paper,  X  Optimization Techniques for Vote Based Classifier Ensemble: Application to Named Entity Recognition  X  from Asif Ekbal and Sriparna Saha, applies classification techniques for named entity recognition. The third paper,  X  Categorization of Malicious Behaviors Using Cognitive Agents  X  CMBCA  X  from Umar Manzoor, Samia Nefti and Yacine Rezgui uses classification and ontology for the detection of illegal unknown software applications. The last paper  X  Extracting Meronymy Relationships from Domain-Specific, Textual Corporate Databases  X  from Ashwin Itoo, Gosse Bouma, Laura Maruster and Hans Wortman, proposes a method for extracting meronymy relationships from textual databases.

Finally, the authors and editors of this special issue wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their fruitful remarks and all the improvements they suggested.
