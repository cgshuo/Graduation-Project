 1. Introduction
In the information retrieval context (IR), the resources of a collection are frequently classified and searched using concepts from thesauri and other simple knowledge models. However, since they reflect the vision of those who created and maintain them, they are not homogeneous and may contain heterogeneous concepts and relations [1]. For example, in the Urbamet generic, cannot be easily interpreted, and their unclear hierarchies hinder the browsing through the concepts. a manual alignment between the concepts of a thesaurus and the categories in the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and
Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) [5] to precise the meaning of the thesaurus concepts and broader/narrower relations. The main issue with this approach is the need of a manual alignment. This step reduces the applicability of the process to big models because the manual work required is not affordable.

This paper proposes an automatic alignment process which can be used to replace the manual approach described in Lacasta the models that can be transformed.
 Performing this alignment automatically is not trivial because of the terminological gap between any thematic thesaurus and provides conceptual-semantic and lexical relations between general and thematic concepts from the natural language.
We have tested the process with the thesauri used to classify the European Urban Knowledge Network the Urbamet 3 bibliographical databases. Additionally, to demonstrate the improved search possibilities that the generated models provide, we describe a thematic atlas system that uses thesauri enriched with DOLCE relations to access the Urbamet collection.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed formalization method. Then, Section 3 analyzes the quality of the models generated when applying the process to EUKN and Urbamet thesauri. Section 4 shows the applicability of these models for improving search systems. Section 5 reviews other formalization works in the literature and compares them with the proposed approach. Finally, this paper ends with a discussion about the process, some conclusions, and an outlook on future work. 2. Alignment-based method for the formalization of thesauri
The alignment of a thematic thesaurus and DOLCE requires to deal with the abstraction gap between them. DOLCE is a formal is unlikely that exact (or partial) equivalences can be found between them. The proposed alignment process searches for specialization relations that classify the thesaurus concepts as subtypes of DOLCE classes.
 verbs, adjectives and adverbs into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations providing a hypernym/hyponym hierarchy of semantically a thematic thesaurus.
 The process is divided in three subtasks (see Fig. 1 ): the mapping between the thematic thesaurus and WordNet; the use of the
WordNet hypernym/hyponym relations to deduce the alignment between the source thesaurus and DOLCE; and the use of these alignments to refine the thesaurus broader/narrower relations. The following subsections describe each subtask in detail. 2.1. Mapping to WordNet WordNet concepts are much more specific than those in DOLCE. This simplifies the alignment with a thematic thesaurus.
However, they are still too generic to make the alignment a simple lexical matching process. A more elaborate process that analyzes the meaning of the involved concepts is required.
 a single alignment. 2.1.1. Lexical mapping to WordNet
This step identifies exact correspondences with WordNet and subsumption relations in concepts with no exact correspondence. Algorithm 1 shows how this matching is performed. It obtains the labels of the concept to match (preferred and alternatives), transforms them into singular form using a simplified version of Porter stemming algorithm [9] to deal with number issues (invocation to getSingularForm function in Alg. 1), and searches for exact concordance of the processed labels in access to WordNet. 4
If no exact equivalence is found, an alternative approach is used. Thesaurus construction methodologies promote the by construction we can establish a subsumption relation between them and the original labels. For example, the concepts baths  X  and  X  equipment for senior citizens  X  can be considered as subtypes of
Alg. 1 ) based on the thesaurus term definition guidelines. These nouns are matched with WordNet in the same way as the complete concept labels ( getSynsets function). Algorithm 1. Lexical mapping to WordNet
If a concept/noun is polysemic, it will correspond to several senses (synsets) in WordNet (the different meanings a term has in in WordNet and lead to an incorrect alignment with DOLCE. Fig. 3 depicts an example of this sense alignment problem. on the selected sense,  X  high school  X  can be classified as a
The following two steps apply heuristics that use additional knowledge to disambiguate the correct sense. 2.1.2. Thesaurus context based disambiguation
Thesauri are homogeneous descriptions of the knowledge in a certain area of interest. Since all the contained concepts have related meanings, one may reasonably suppose that all the concepts sharing a noun use it with the same sense. This circumstance allows us to assume that already defined monosemic matches can be used to identify the sense of all other thesaurus concepts disambiguate (invocation to getLabelsUsingNoun function in Alg. 2 ) that have been matched with a single WordNet sense in the senses of the noun. The senses with more matches (they are hypernyms of more disambiguated concepts) are selected as new set disambiguated. If there is no concordance, the original set of synsets is not modified.
 Algorithm 2. Thesaurus context based disambiguation
Fig. 4 shows an example of how this process is applied. It depicts some Urbamet concepts that include (  X  sports  X  ,  X  water sport  X  ,  X  winter sport  X  and  X  equestrian sport hypernym of  X  water sport  X  (it has a previous monosemic matching) is selected. As a consequence, the other concepts in the set (  X  sports  X  ,  X  winter sport  X  ,  X  equestrian sport  X  ) are identified as 2.1.3. Resource collection based disambiguation
Those concepts that are not matched with a single WordNet synset are submitted to an alternative disambiguation process. It Then, it compares these names with those in the WordNet definitions of the possible synsets.

The nouns in the abstract set are matched with the nouns in each candidate WordNet sense definition using the direct cosine abstracts classified with the concept c ;and occur ( n , X ) describes the number of occurrences of the noun n in the set X .
Fig. 5 shows the application of this matching process to the Urbamet  X  landscape  X  in WordNet yields 4 senses. Then, the resources in the collection classified with a landscape  X  ,  X  Rural landscape  X  ,  X  Vegetal landscape  X ... sense definitions are processed to extract their common nouns (e.g., the similarity formula (Eq. (1) ) is applied and the sense more similar to the abstracts is identified (an expanse of scenery 2.2. Identi fi cation of DOLCE equivalences
Once the thesaurus concepts are linked to a WordNet sense, the WordNet hypernym/hyponym hierarchy is used to identify specialization relations with DOLCE.

This process requires an alignment between the abstract WordNet concepts (in the firsts levels of the hypernym/hyponym not broadly available and it is not compatible with the last versions of WordNet. Therefore, we have generated our own WordNet  X  DOLCE alignment. It takes the collection of WordNet senses and searches for exact equivalences of their labels in DOLCE. To improve the number of matches identified, gender/number issues are corrected using Porter stemming algorithm.
As a result, 75 out of the 208 DOLCE classes have been matched, including among them the desired main DOLCE categories them (e.g., socially constructed person, production workflow execution). Moreover, many of the unmatched concepts are specializations of other matched ones. Thus, even if the correct alignment cannot be found, a more general one can be provided. Algorithm 3. Identi_cation of DOLCE equivalences
Algorithm 2 shows how the senses matched with the thesaurus concepts are aligned with DOLCE. First, the getHypernyms the synsets in the list searching for a match with DOLCE (the map dolceMatch contains the previously defined WordNet alignment). The first match identified is the one used as alignment between the thesaurus concept associated to the WordNet sense and DOLCE. This approach guarantees that the most specific alignment available is used. If the hypernym/hyponym branch has no sense aligned with DOLCE, the thesaurus concept is left unmapped. Fig. 6 shows the formalization result of the concept. This concept has been previously aligned with the hypernym / hyponym hierarchy, we first find  X  recreation  X 
DOLCE  X  activity  X  concept. Therefore, the  X  winter sport 2.3. Relations re fi nement relation.

DOLCE provides several possible relations between two classes. For example, the relation between a geographical-object and a determine the relation to use for each pair of DOLCE classes in a given context is used. Table 1 shows a summary of the rules defined in the context of urbanism for the models described in the experiment section. For example, the selected relation between a physical-object and an abstract quality is has-quality .
 and that it can be measured ( has-quality ) through the Water quality ,the Air quality and so on. 3. Evaluation of the process results
The formalization process has been applied to EUKN and Urbamet thesauri. The use of EUKN allows comparing the quality of the result with respect to the manual alignment proposed in [4] . The use of Urbamet is oriented towards the validation of the process with bigger models.
 the alignment obtained between each thesaurus and WordNet. Finally, it describes the quality of the alignment between the two thesauri and DOLCE. 3.1. The Urbamet and EUKN collections and their thesauri
The CDU (French Center of Urban Documentation) and EUKN are two organizations focused on enhancing the exchange of urban knowledge and expertise between scientists, practitioners and decision-makers. Designed and maintained by the CDU, the Urbamet

 bigger database with almost 250,000 bibliographic notes and an estimated growth of 8000 new notes each year. From these 250,000 the resources (132 in EUKN, 312 in Urbamet).
 3.2. Mapping of the Urbamet and EUKN thesauri with DOLCE
The application of the formalization process to EUKN and Urbamet thesaurus has required their transformation into a common format: SKOS [13] for thesauri and RDF/Dublin core [14] for the bibliographic record describing each article. Dublin Core is a standard vocabulary for resource description. Their elements are generic and they are used for describing a wide range of resources. SKOS provides a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems such as thesauri using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This facilitates its use in distributed, decentralized metadata applications.
Additionally, since the Urbamet collection abstracts are in French, we had to translate them into English. This has been automatically done using the Microsoft Bing Translator Web Service. manually measured the quality of the thesaurus  X  WordNet alignment and the WordNet
EUKN model has been completely reviewed, the size of Urbamet has obliged us to select a representative branch of the whole thesaurus: the 208 concepts of the  X  urban planning development 3.2.1. Thesaurus  X  WordNet mapping results
Table 3 shows the polysemy degree of the EUKN and Urbamet concepts and their extracted nouns (for those without exact non-ambiguous correspondence in WordNet). The table contains the number of concepts in each thesaurus that have 0, 1 or N senses in WordNet (# concepts column) and the corresponding percentage (% concepts column). Since the a-priori probability of Urbamet would be correctly matched.

Table 4 shows the improvement obtained when the improved mapping process is applied (concept is considered aligned when a single sense is obtained). It shows the number of concepts processed (Conc column), the number of those aligned (Conc
Aligned column), the percentage of concepts aligned (% Thes Align column), the number of concepts with a correct alignment (Conc Corr Align column), the percentage of success (% Corr Align column) and the percentage of the thesaurus/branch correctly of the concepts (vs. the initial 30.28% and 43.50%). 3.2.2. Thesaurus  X  WordNet  X  DOLCE mapping results
Using the thesaurus  X  WordNet alignments as an intermediate step, the final thesaurus
Table 5 . The table shows how many of the correct Thesaurus correct DOLCE alignment. It contains the total of correct alignments (DC Align column) and the corresponding percentage (% Align column). It can be observed that around 59% of EUKN concepts and 75% of URBAMET concepts aligned with WordNet are complete thesaurus  X  DOLCE alignment process. It shows the percentage of concepts correctly aligned (% T Corr column), incorrectly aligned (T Incorr column), and not aligned (% T not column).

The process works significantly better for Urbamet (58%) than for EUKN (32%) because of the differences in thesaurus
WordNet alignment coverage and because EUKN concepts are assigned to WordNet areas with worse DOLCE alignment. The lack of mappings between EUKN and WordNet can be explained analyzing the structure of the thesaurus concept terms and its collection. On the one hand, the EUKN thesaurus is more heterogeneous than the Urbamet model. The Urbamet thesaurus has respect to Urbamet (the context is not so rich). Additionally, about 40% of EUKN thesaurus concepts have been never used for classifications (no context can be derived from abstracts if these concepts are polysemic). With respect to the WordNet alignment difference, the problem is the lack for correct WordNet
EUKN). For example, in EUKN, 78.30% of the  X  activities  X  reduced to 36.30% of the regulations and to 4.70% of the rational-agents. It is caused by the way the WordNet performed. WordNet polysemy makes that 289 WordNet senses share labels with 75 classes in DOLCE and not all of these senses are correct for alignment (they do not have a compatible meaning). The use of one incorrect WordNet process leads to an erroneous Thesaurus  X  DOLCE alignment. A better WordNet alignment quality of this step, leaving the thesaurus  X  WordNet coverage problem as the main issue to solve. aligned with DOLCE. The distribution of the unmapped concepts along the thesauri structure hinders the conversions capabilities reducing the number of processable relations to a 14% and 34% respectively (see # RToForm and % RToForm columns in Table 6 ). 4. Applicability of the formalized models to provide a different view of bibliographic databases
To test the applicability of the formalized model in an information retrieval context we have designed a facet based search the documents associated to these topics (step 3) and other topics related to each selected one (step 4).
The construction of the prototype has required the transformation of the Urbamet collection descriptions into a semantic repository that integrates the formalized Urbamet thesaurus (for thematic access) and a jurisdictional ontology (for spatial access). The original descriptions (with title, abstract, location respect to the Urbamet thesaurus, the original XML files have been transformed to SKOS format using the conversion methodology described in Lacasta et al. [15] . Then, our proposed formalization process has been used to generate an enriched
OWL file. The spatial model extends the jurisdictional domain ontology described in Lopez-Pellicer et al. [16] . This ontology provides an OWL model aligned with DOLCE that describes the different jurisdictional divisions of a country. It has been completed with the French jurisdictional instances provided by the Second Administrative Level Boundaries data set project [17] and the municipalities provided by the Institut Geographique National
Additionally, since the collection contains some resources making references to countries outside France, the list of countries provided by ISO-3166 standard [18] has been added to the model.

The integration of the collection with the thematic and spatial ontologies is done by replacing the original textual references stored in a Jena 8 semantic repository and accessed through a SPARQL end point provided by the Fuseki beyond the original broader/narrower relationships (they are replaced with the different types of relations provided by DOLCE). 5. Related work
The process described in this paper aligns automatically a thesaurus with DOLCE ontology. The objective is to provide a better different contexts related to information retrieval. Concepts and relations in a thesaurus may not be properly defined. As a identification of these elements helps to provide better search systems for already available collections of resources.
This section reviews the works focused on adding semantics to thesauri and other knowledge models and compares them with the approach proposed in this paper.

The most simple transformation approaches are manual. They provide high quality alignments but at expenses of a high (AAT) into richer subtypes through the analysis of sample extracts of AAT Editorial Related Term Sheets and the AAT editorial and synonyms to generate RDF concepts. Golbeck et al. [21] describe the transformation process of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) thesaurus into OWL format. They describe what happens when converting concepts and defining the original roles of the Agricultural Thesaurus from a relational database into RDF format, but it does not add any additional semantics.
Focusing on knowledge models different from thesauri, Aleksovski et al. [27] propose a method to match lists of terms using different disambiguation and heuristic techniques and pre-existent upper or domain formal ontologies. van Damme et al. [28] also show how folksonomies and other unstructured vocabularies can be used to construct ontologies. They describe an approach for deriving ontologies from folksonomies based on the statistical analysis of the folksonomies, the use of online lexical and semantic web resources, the application of ontology matching (and mapping) approaches, and the computer assisted revision of the results. Vatant [29] proposes the use of OWL/RDF to define constraints on topics, associations, roles and other knowledge objects manipulated by a Topic Map to be able to validate if a topic map commits to an ontology. Finally, Sridharan et al. [30] propose a topic map approach that incorporates semantic annotations to construct a multi-level ontology-driven topic map that facilitates an effective visualization, classification and global authoring of e-learning resources.
From a general perspective, our proposed process is similar to those previously described as they also present disambiguation procedures to detecttheequivalencesonthebasis of names,definitions,and relations ofthe concepts in the models toalign. However, with a different level of abstraction (DOLCE). The proposed process uses the subsumption relation of an intermediate ontology (WordNet) to avoid the semantic gap and connect the concepts between the source thesaurus and the ontology.
We use WordNet as an intermediate model because it contains a hierarchy of concepts with a level of abstraction that allows work in a similar way as WordNet. Another alternative is YAGO [32] , a knowledge base which integrates concepts extracted from
Wikipedia, WordNet, and GeoNames. This knowledge base maintains WordNet hierarchical relations, but it includes much more
Finally, the automatic nature of our proposed process presents some limitations. It mainly depends on the correct identification of equivalences between the thesaurus concepts and WordNet. An error in this identification will generate an incorrect DOLCE class and the inferred relations will not be the appropriate. As it can be observed in the results discussed in
Section 3 , the quality greatly depends on how these mappings have been established. Currently, the percentage of correctly matched concepts does not allow a complete direct use of the formalized thesaurus in a working environment. However, it is a starting point that can be refined into a more complete ontology, instead of having to generate it from scratch. 6. Conclusions and outlook on future work This paper has described a formalization approach for thesauri that reduces the heterogeneity of their concepts and relations.
The process enriches the thesaurus concepts and relations through an alignment with DOLCE. To fill the semantic gap between the models to align, the WordNet structure is used. The process starts with a thesaurus DOLCE alignment step, which uses the WordNet hypernyms/hyponyms hierarchy to generalize the thesaurus concepts into the
DOLCE level. It finishes with a relations improvement step, which uses the created alignment to replace the thesaurus broader/ narrower relations with other more specific relations from DOLCE.
 shown the possibilities of the process but also the areas of future improvement. On the one hand, the thesaurus
Yago, SUMO or alternative knowledge models could be considered instead of WordNet. On the other hand, a better WordNet since some semantic gaps between WordNet and DOLCE still need to be filled. There are concepts with the same labels that have a the alignment manually. The cost of reviewing the generated results is more reduced than the creation of a new alignment from scratch. On the one hand, the revision of each match only requires a comparison of the meaning of the two involved concepts. To with respect to the manual approach: review the DOLCE ontology in search of the suitable alignment.
An alternative to improve the quality of the model would be to perform the manual revision after each step of the process. This would eliminate the accumulation of errors that hinder the final results. However, it would require to review the thesaurus
Wordnet alignment, and the WordNet  X  DOLCE alignment. Therefore, it is not clear that this approach has any advantage in cost improving the different steps in the proposed process in order to generate a better model that requires less revision effort.
As future work, we will consider the possibility of using the different components of the process to construct a semiautomatic senses, the objective would be to calculate all the WordNet establishing manual mappings (a reduced list is provided), while maintaining the quality of a supervised process.
To test the applicability of the generated models, a facet based search component that combines thematic and spatial features as an atlas has been proposed for Urbamet collection. Whereas the Urbamet thesaurus has been used as thematic model, a preexistent jurisdictional ontology has been used for spatial features. This application has shown how formalized models can facilitate searches in a collection based on their metadata descriptions and the advantages that the application of inference focused on DOLCE categories (activities, events, rational-agents in the future, these approaches could be extended with the use of non-transitive relations. For example, the user could ask the system for anything  X  performed by  X  an  X  agent  X  to obtain the resources classified as
Another area of work would be the integration of other thesauri and knowledge models used in a processed collection. For example, in the case of temporal information, the ontology proposed by Gutierrez et al. [34] and Hurtado and Vaisman [35] could be used after it is aligned with DOLCE. Similarly, authority information (authors, organizations, departments integrated. In this case, repositories such as the International Virtual Authority File them and include richer relations (e.g.,  X  part-of  X  ,  X  works-in hierarchical knowledge models such as taxonomies or even concept networks such as topic maps.
