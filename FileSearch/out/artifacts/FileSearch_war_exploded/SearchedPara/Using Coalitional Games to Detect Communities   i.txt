 With the increasing popularity of social networks, community detection has received a great deal of attentions recently. Researchers have proposed various methods to etc. These methods reveal structures of networks from different perspectives. community detection algorithms. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical structure. Existing algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. Therefore, developing new community detection approaches for large networks is a challenging task. 
Coalitional game (Zlotkin and Rosenschein 1994) focuses on the cooperative be-cooperation, players gain more payoff than those individuals on their own. In coali-provides a unique and fair solution (Shapley 1953). 
In social networks, co-operations amongst individuals co-exist with conflicts amongst individuals, because individuals with similar interests are more likely to cooperate with each other, but an individual X  X  influence in a network is dependent on itself as well as others. These interactive and cooperative features can be analyzed by using game theory. Furthermore, a community in a social network is a group of indi-viduals with closely connection . Clearly, the degree of  X  closely connection  X  de-pends on the interrelationships between individuals. Therefore, communities can be described by coalitions, and each individual X  X  contribution to the closeness of connec-tion can be evaluated by the Shapley Value. In this paper, we propose coalitional game models for community detection based on topological structures of social networks, and we use the Shapley Value to eva-the computation of the Shapley Values is not polynomial time (Lemke and Howson 1964), thus we develop an iterative formula to improve the computation efficiency. We also present a hierarchical clustering algorithm GAMEHC for detecting commun-ities and apply it into a real network. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related work. Section 3 introduces the coalitional game theoretic approach for community detec-tion. Section 4 shows experimental results. Section 5 concludes the paper. Fortunato (2010) provided a comprehensive survey on community detection ap-proaches, such as hierarchical clustering, m odularity optimization, percolation, etc. In addition, many new methods have been proposed to detect communities in recent years (Ahn et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2012 ). 
Coalitional game theory has been used in various applications, for example, Liu et al. (2011) applied coalitional game theory to discover different groups from given objects; Saad et al. (2009) applied coalitiona l game theory to the analysis of commu-biological networks to measure centrality and power of genes. 
The Shapley Value is a key solution concept for coalitional games, due to it provides a Shapley Values is very heavy., so many approximation methods have been developed (Owen 1972; Fatima et al. 2008). In the context of networks, Karthik et al. (2010) devel-oped exact analytical formulas for computing the Shapley Value based centralities. 3.1 Coalition Games and the Shapley Value the characteristic function , assigning a real value to each N S  X  .

In coalitional games, how to split the total worth between the players is an impor-tant issue. The Shapley Value (Shapley 1953) is a widely used value division scheme in the theory of coalitional games. Definition 2. The Shapley Value (Shapley 1953).

However, the complexity of computing Shapley Value is heavy. Based on the Definition 3, we can develop an iterative formula for computing the Shapley Value to improve the compu-tation efficiency. The iterative formulas for computing the Shapley Value are given in the Theorem 4. coalition S with respect to ) , ( v N can be compute by formula (3): 3.4 The Algorithm for Detecting Communities Theorem 4 means that if we combine any two small-size coalitions to a large-size coalition, then the Shapley Value w.r.t. the large-size coalition will not be lesser than those of small-size coalitions. Based on this property, we propose a hierarchical clus-tering algorithm GAMEHC to generate large-size coalition level after level. With the process of combination, multiple partitionings will be produced. These partitionings The GAMEHC algorithm is described as follows: Algorithm GAMEHC Input: Output : communities Step 1 .

It is a well-known social network used as a benchmark for evaluating community detection algorithms. The process of combining coalitions is represented by a dendrogram, shown in Fig.3. 
From Fig.2, we can see that the process of combining coalitions reveals the hie-rarchy organization of the network. Each individual selects a coalition to join in some level, such that it can receive the highes t Shapley Value. We can extract communities at multiple levels by cutting this dendrogram according to various modularity values. Community detection is an important issue in social network analysis. In this paper a coalitional game theoretic approach for detecting communities has been presented. To improve the computation efficiency, an iterative formula for computing the Shapley Value is developed, and last a hierarch ical clustering algorithm GAMEHC is pro-posed. This algorithm can reveal hi erarchy organization of networks. Acknowledgments.
