 The text classification methods heavily depend on machine learning algorithms with abstract mathematic metrics, which obstruct the direct observation and intuitive understanding of the text-specific classification. In th is paper, we model a document as a Document-Classes-Topics top-down hierarchical structure. Furthermore, by running the docu ment generation procedure, we can obtain each class X  X  content share, which not only can be used to make the classification decisi on but also can provide a natural visualization approach for text classification. We implement this idea by a new tool named TC-DCA, which provides the visualization of text classification result, where the target document is expressed graphically as its content X  X  allocation on every class. TC-DCA can also perform the drilling down operation to reveal th e classification effect of each word of the document. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieva l]: Clustering; I.2.7 [ Natural Language Processing ]: Text analysis Algorithms, Design, Human Factors Text Classification, Document X  X  Content Allocation, Statistical Topic Model, Variational Inference Text classification (TC) is a ke y technology for both information retrieval and knowledge management, and it has attracted large amounts of research. In resent years, the universal machine learning algorithms has became the TC's dominating paradigm[1] with little investment to the specific properties of text. Firstly, TC shows nearly a black box with weak comprehensibility. The traditional TC algorithms ar e heavily dependent on abstract metrics, such as the inner-product in feature space for SVM [2] and the likelihood for Bayes Classifier [3]. In fact, both metrics are not the inherent nature of te xt media. Other algorithms also pose the similar cases. In this pa per, we use the proportion of the document content allocated to each class for the TC task. This metric derives from document itself thus can promise well comprehensibility. Furthermore, the traditional TC task is usually defined as a binary map which can be formulated as f : ( D , C )  X  {0,1}. But many applications require the soft text classification which can rank the classes in terms of their correlati on to the document or vice versa. This requirement needs a reliable and comparable measure on the correlation of any &lt;document, cl ass&gt; pair. Document X  X  content shares of classes can act as such a measure and well suit to the soft classification setting. In addition, the visualization of TC [4] usually focuses on the dataset distribution in low-dime nsion space where each document is presented as a point without fu rther inner structure. However, TC task is mainly based on text content, so it is more important to exhibit the content proportion of each class and the exact location in the raw document. In this paper, we model a document as the composition of contents from the classes to which it belongs. Based on this model, we can obtain the content shares of the document among all classes by running the document generation procedure, and then determine the classes to which the target document belongs. We have implemented this method as a new tool named TC-DCA, which can naturally support the so ft classification. TC-DCA can also visualize the TC task by exhibiting the content weights of all classes and the location of each class X  X  content in the target document. We model a document as a top-down hierarchical structure -Document-Classes-Topics shown in Figure 1, where a document X  X  content is composited by the contents of the classes to which the document belongs. Afterwards, each class X  X  content includes proper number of topics which are express by words (omitted in Figure 1). Based on the above model, we can generate the document following 3 successive steps: Firstly, we decide what classes of content need to be included. Then we organize topics discussed for each class. In the end, we use appropriate words to express each topic. Content allocation can be viewed as a bottom-up procedure, Words-Topics-Classes , which is the core element for both the learning and the prediction phase. Here, we realize the content allocation operation by statistical topic modeling. In the document hierarchical structure (Figure 1), the topic level is instanced by multiple LDA [5] models, one LDA model for each class. The corresponding learning algorithm is similar to Beli X  X  variational- X  X  [5], where the main difference lies in the E-step. As formula (1), we intr oduce the class-guidance I l ( d ) document X  X  content to th e classes it belongs to : For document class prediction, we firstly make use of the variational-inference to allocate the whole content of the target document among all topics as formula (2) where denotes the content share possessed by the i -th topic of class c . Then, as formula (3), we aggregate the content shares from the topic level to the document level, thus we can obtain every class X  X  content share, which is suitable for the applications need soft classification or ranking. We develop a tool named TC -DCA to demonstrate the Document X  X  Content Allocation method for TC task. TC-DCA has two main visualization views to show the effects and mechanisms, the chart view as Figure 2 and the table view as Figure 3: Figure2. TC-DCA: Document X  X  Co ntent Allocation by Classes The Figure 2 shows the content allocation among classes for a document. This allocation derive s the each class X  X  proportion of the target document. So, it determines the document's class label(s), besides it can also be used for document recommendation, filtering and etc. l ( d ) is the class label subs et to which the document d belongs. The Figure 3 shows the target document's words distribution on classes, which can be used to locate the specific class information in the raw document. This property has the potential role for some high accuracy information access task such as passage retrieval, question answer and so on. The text classification procedure in TC-DCA has three main steps. Firstly, the text preparations su ch as word segmentation, POS and classification, is performed. Finally the classification results are displayed as statistical charts and tables. These three steps are logic sequence which is comple ted only by clicking on the  X  OK  X  button after the target document to be classified is specified.
