 Supporting scientific practice ha s been a longstanding goal of CSCW research. This paper explores how we might design for social science research practices and collaboration. Drawing on sixteen interviews with fieldwork-based social scientists we document the importance of small-scale long-term collaborative researchers who work together in-depth over their careers, developing a common yet distinctive view of their research field. This contrasts with the large-scale short-lived collaborations that have classically been the target of cyber-infrastructure work. We describe technology practices among social scientists and how these can inform technology de sign for fieldwork practices. H.4.0 [Information Systems ]: Information Systems Applications: General Human Factors. Cyber-infrastructure, e-social science, fieldwork One of the major uses of group technologies is collaborative infrastructure and e-social science are testament to an increasing use of these technologies for sc ience [13, 20]. But where much collaborations that are part of particularly social science research. social science research being undertaken by small groups of individuals, even single individual s, who perform work that is conducted using generic ad-hoc t echnologies (such as email, internet information search and word processing), using well-established methods. The reflection of this process has so far been expressed through literature analyses, co-authorship evaluation criteria [22, 31]. Particularly small-scale field-work research has received little attention, possibly due to its perceived utilization of diversity in approach. How is it even possible to group social science fieldworkers as one type of technology users? In this fieldwork from an inclusive but de tailed perspective. We look at the detailed collaborations and collaboration technologies for the tight-knit social scientists that conduct fieldwork; although this group seem broadly defined, we find that these researchers have much in common and that addressing technology utilization is a productive step in the directio n of designing and implementing future technologies for e-social science. Small-scale fieldwork is research. describing how these social scientists collaborate, collect data, conduct analysis and work toge ther on publications. While the methods, we focus here on scientis ts who use field methods of one shape or form  X  collecting empirical data in the home environments of those being stud ied. The researchers we studied span sociology, criminology, dr ug policy, education and social psychology, draw on quantitative and qualitative methods, as well commitments. Focusing on the researchers X  fieldwork practices and their collaborations were of essence. This contrasts with those who have argued for an increase in the scale of social science; for example, Atkins et al. [2] argue that  X  X ocial science research is on the verge of being transformed through distributed global collaborations, the use of very large data collections, tera-scale computing resources, and high perfo rmance visualization X . To the social scientists we studied these  X  X era-scale computing resources X  were on the whole irrelevant. The collaborations that were most important to them were much smaller groups of two or three researchers working together over long periods of time -career-long in many cases. These colla borations were often conducted over a distance, yet researchers still formed a distinctive joint worldview and analytic approach. What is key to the collaborative practices is how social science researchers become tied together with distinct theoretical commitments and worldviews. collaboration between scientists, witnessed by an increase of co-authorship in many disciplines [38]. Research shows that the increasing use of computer-mediated communication can lead to higher scientific productivity [37, 42] and  X  X yber-infrastructures X  more generally have been show n to facilitate geographically dispersed research. However, much current research on cyber-infrastructure has been dominated by the natural sciences [36]. While grid computing, shared access to computational models, or the social sciences, much social science research tackles quite distinct research problems that render these systems inappropriate [10]. The emerging program of e-social science, or  X  X -research X  science research [3]. While acknowledging the great diversity within the social sciences, social science research frequently deals with relatively small sets of data , theoretical explorations, activist engagements, and a long term co mmitment to investigating from interpretivist, or at least non-positiv ist, traditions [16, 26, 41]. For these social scientists their work problems and potential use of cyber-infrastructure are distinctly different from the concerns of  X  X ig science X . The study of many complex activities -such as seldom reducible to sharing ra w data, but rather a complex process of  X  X oming to see X  the world in common [6, 18, 19]. These practices demand distinctive collaborative tools, tools built from an understanding of the intellectual and collaborative processes involved. Indeed, a number of recent critiques have argued that current cyber-infrastructure work has been dominated by technology [3], and that there has been insufficient consideration of the nature of scientific work [22], conditions of technology use [23], and system usability [35, 36]. As David [10] pointed out:  X  X ngineering breakthroughs alone will not be enough to achieve the outcomes envisaged for these undertakings. Success in realizing the technical transformations X . These issues come particularly to the fore when considering the social sciences. Studies of scientific practice ar e most strongly exemplified by work in science and technology studies. However only recently has attention been paid to studying the work of the social sciences. Notable here is Porter X  X  work on statistics and discussions of reflexivity and social science practice [15, 32, 36]. Recently studies of economics, and the relati onships between its intellectual concepts and the behavior of markets [7, 27, 28] have gained prominence, alongside studies of interaction in interviews and survey settings, and the related que stions of standardization in social science survey research [29, 30]. Within CSCW there has been grow ing interest in examining and designing for the work of scientists [5, 9, 13, 25]. Our field has a particularly powerful position here, drawing on the tradition of studying the practice of difficult to understand, complex work infrastructure can support new data collection techniques, such as instant messaging [39], phone based experience sampling [8], or Butterflynet [42], which allowed field biologists to share and augment paper-based field-notes. In Europe a number of researchers have also taken the lead in developing  X  X -Infrastructure X  research, drawing on ethnographic approaches to cyber-infrastructure [20, 33]. One example of this research is the eDiaMoND project that studied the development of new practices in mamography and the key importance of skill and trust between scientists [21, 23]. More recently, Brown et al. explored how wikis could be appr opriated to support collaboration amongst ethnographers [6] and Fraser et al. examined how tools could support practices of remote joint video analysis sessions [14]. This work has been part of the move away from notions of  X  X Science X  into the concept of  X  X Research X . Lastly, a growing body of literature has documented experiences with the use of cyber-infrastructure in science practice [4]. A key support the practice of data shar ing and modeling for the purpose of collaborating on social science projects, for example the Virtual Data Center, an open-source, dig ital library system designed to assist researchers in sharing an d disseminating data [1]. Other researchers have used  X  X rid te chnologies X  to explore and model spatial distribution of crime us ing analytical frameworks from science and technology studies [ 40]. Here, studies emphasize that challenges is that these communities of practices are fluid and constantly renegotiated [5]. Our research interests were broadly in the collaborative practices of social science research, and how this collaboration extended to the practice of fieldwork and fiel d based research. We interviewed sixteen researchers attempting an open-ended way to understand connections with colleagues, an d how they manage and conduct their fieldwork. Initial inquiry emphasized general practices but collaborations. We included res earchers who published work that involved direct interactions with those who were being studied, with data collected from the field in the actual places where those being studied worked, lived or vi sited -broadly research that involved  X  X ield work X . This encompassed work that would be recognizable as traditional ethnography, research that involved the use of structured from in-depth interviews, and even observations and video analysis of congressional debates. This fieldwork spanned a large variety of different materials and our participants in turn brought a participants through snowball sampling using personal contacts at three universities, one in the US , one in Denmark and one in Sweden as well as a criminal po licy research institute, and one health institute, both in the US. important to recognize that not all fieldwork is the same. Our interviewees differed in their use of methods noticeably -four made use of computer assisted survey systems alongside paper questionnaires in their fieldwork, one used life histories, others used focus groups. In particular our researchers used much more structured methods ( X  X nstruments X ) with larger sample sizes than traditional open-ended ethnographic-led methods that characterize for example HCI fieldwork. A broader range of settings also American villages or the alcohol sections in supermarkets. Few of the researchers we spoke to only used fieldwork -most supplemented their materials with others X  data, archive records, education researchers, two resear ched substance abuse, and one each for cognitive science, science and technology studies, economics, ethnology and criminology. The participants ranged from graduate students and research assistants to full professors with over 20 years of research experience. Eight of them were researchers in Sweden and Denmark, four were at large public US universities, and four worked in non-profit research organizations in the US. None of the researchers worked directly in the CSCW our researchers. Collaboration was key to the scientific practices we studied, but take place in both science and social science [12], despite the attention it has been given in the current generation of cyber-infrastructure systems. For the social scientists of our study, their social relationships were much mo re important than any notion of  X  X ata sharing X . Collaboration with other scientists was not only common to our participants but a characteristic of virtually all changed from when they had conducted their thesis work some 20-30 years ago and argued that with the increased pressure to publication count. They simply did not have enough time to work on solo projects any longer. collaborations: long term sm all group, local opportunistic, apprenticeship, and large scale collaborations. To an extent these collaboration: scientists described involved cl ose-knit collaboration between themselves and one or two other peers. All except two interviewees (who were relatively junior) had these types of collaborators. In some cases they were from the same department or a local institution, but usually due to the high mobility of social scientists these coll aborations took place over a distance. Our academics co-authored repeatedly within this group, and the researchers were polygamous, in that they would be a member of more than one close collaborati on, with each group featuring a collaboration, sometimes for their whole career to-date. These collaborations often emerged early on in the researcher X  X  career -in one case it had started as an advisory relationship, but researchers when they were in the same institution. They were maintained highly regular contact (multiple emails or face to face relation to  X  X ther X  researchers. For example, one collaboration started between three researchers who had watched a documentary film together, approached the creators of the documentary, wrote up a funding proposal with their assistance and after receiving the grant began a long-term collabor ation together. Another example was a reoccurring collaboration between a Swedish researcher and two US researchers (a husband and wife) who had spent the last ten or so summers in Sweden working with him. This collaboration was surprisingly clos e-knit considering the distance, particularly during the summer when they were co-located. Most other researchers X  collaborations did not involve regular visits, but rather opportunistic meetings and a large amount of communication through email and phone. Two of our researchers collaborated with. A distinct set of collaborations took place between colleagues who were at the same institution. These were not valued as the long-term small group collabora tions, but instead took place opportunistic around shared resources, funding or interests. In many cases our researchers would collaborate with a local colleague despite differences in approach because their locality removed the costs of working at a distance. Alternatively, often a local fieldwork sites would provide an impetus for working with local colleagues. Potentially these collaborations could grow into longer term collaborations, but in most cases they acted more like low-commitment  X  X rial relationships X . These collaborations also helped to expand researchers interests and knowledge -exposing them to new ideas and literatures. Alongside these local group collaborations, our participants also often worked in local research groups, and other groups that were mandated (or at least inspired) by organizational commitments. Usually these groups did not feat ure intense co-authorship, but rather acted more as intellectual spaces where ideas could be presented, visitors could be hosted etc. This is not to say that co-collaborations between students and faculty where the students brought together the faculty through co-writing projects. An interesting difference between the Scandinavian researchers collaboration with students, bo th graduate and undergraduate students. The Scandinavian resear chers rarely talked about their students and when they mentioned them, they did not view their relationship as a collaborative one but instead an advisory one. We found two exceptions out of the eight Scandinavian researchers, one researcher who hired Masters students as another who maintained a strong small-group collaboration with a PhD student. The US based researchers on the other hand all mentioned students as collaborativ e relationships. Their rhetoric repeatedly talked about students  X  X orking for him X  collecting data and performing analysis on several of his research projects. The differentiation in approach to student collaboration obviously student infrastructure between th e countries. Where PhD students in Scandinavia tend to be older than their US counterparts they more condensed period where the student is allowed to focus solely on their own project. In th e US, where PhDs generally take order to  X  X une in X  to the world of research. Eight of our interviewees had worked or currently worked on large-scale cross-country collab orations. These included cross-Nordic collaborations, EU project s, NSF projects and national institute of health funded US-wide projects. The in terviewees who had not had cross-country colla borations were mainly young researchers. The cross-country collaborations were often approaches and lack of coordi nation were often cited. Other factors were the rather bureaucratic nature of particularly EU projects that the researchers often faced. One participant described how a Nordic project on alcohol consumption in restaurants had ended up rather differently than he had intended when he started as director: [The researchers X  different re search approaches] caused quite disparate papers [ha ha]... they do different things. [...] I think the ambition in the beginning was to do [the research project] more comparatively, to use the same research questions, the same methodologies. Ehm, different traditions, histories, lack of your thing X , instead of trying to raise funding, coordinate it, [...] I have ambitions... meeting real ity... that thing happens. The concept of  X  X eeting reality X  was a reoccurring obstacle noted in relation to these larger projects. While initial plans (often reality X . Collaborations took pl ace around loose-coupled work, with research mostly in isola tion and only one document (often the funding proposal) and an initial meeting as basis for the research. Although these collaborations did generate face-to-face workshops, one interviewee reporte d about a project that even cultural differences contributed to a diversity that prevented close-nit coherent work. We now continue by outlining a fe w core concepts that emerged as being valuable for the colla borations that were described positively and that most often ended up with results not just publishable, but results considered significant for the individual researcher and his/her career. phases -from formulating and pl anning research (and obtaining funding), through participant or setting recruitment, the interviews and observations themselves, data entry and transformation of data, analytic revision, revision and extraction of arguments, to writing and revision. Each of these phases not only involves different jobs and work processes, but also features differences in terms of how easily or essential collaboration was to the task. Fieldwork, for example, is someth ing that can be easily conducted in parallel more or less independently. Yet there are aspects of fieldwork that need to be coupl ed -in particular the emerging interest and insight of those carrying out the fieldwork. Without divergent views of a particular se tting, and viewpoints that are not necessarily in conflict but are instead irrelevant to each other. For this reason if fieldworkers regularly communicate then the later analysis stages can be much more successful. Indeed through many of the phases of a research project there is the challenge of keeping the independent paths engaged with each other, such that when it came to writing the report or paper at the end the different materials could be brought together. researchers focused on different branches of the overall theme or project and despite workshops that should have brought the fieldwork together, participants reported that these workshops were often failures in other than very general idea exchange. distinct research pieces rather than connected parts of a whole. Research groups working together at a distance often found difficulty in calibrating expectations on what was going to be done where. For example, one of our researchers worked on an autobiography study of alcohol consumption, aiming to be a comparison between people X  X  perception of alcohol in Sweden and Finland. The Swedish researchers created a website where participants could provide their biography, yet the Finish researchers only put up flyers in public forums with no corresponding Finish website. This resulted in a large difference between the number of entries received and the length of the entries between Sweden and Finland. times to work together, and the right times to work apart. For researchers that are physically close this could entail simply working from the same office -such as when a senior fieldworker and a more junior fieldworker worked together, supporting a fluidity in moving between ti ght and loose coupled work throughout the fieldwork. In particular, we highlight two core issues that contribute to successful collaborations. One way of dealing with complexities of collaboration is to make use of routines -such as week ly phone calls or meetings. For those working together at a distance these sort of temporal structures were important -as has been confirmed in much earlier CSCW work [24]. For the long-term small group collaborations that we discussed above the flex ibility of the academic calendar proved to be essential to support their work. Researchers would use visits (such as th e summer or sabbaticals) to spend intense time working together, packing the  X  X ightly coupled X  work into the time they were together. Others would travel together on of Sweden with two of his collabora tors for a month to gather data and produce a documentary film. Fieldwork time together was important not just for conducting fieldwork but also for understanding better other researchers. Meetings also took place over video conferencing systems and simply telephone conferences , popularly over Skype. One researcher who worked within sm aller but geographically widely spread groups (for example Japan, the US, Sweden) used it extensively:  X  X ep, I use Skype, but we also use something called Marratech, which is a videoconference system, basically that you very, very good. X  Other researchers relied mostly on the phone, of meeting technology used, instead it seemed to be used if one of the collaborators were a  X  X river X  of new technology and had introduced it to the rest of the group. Interestingly, the approach to th ese meetings were mixed; some were considered important and e ssential, other meetings were simply considered mandatory and possibly time wasting, depending on the level of autonomy the researcher had over them. We have a weekly conference call. On Mondays. [...] we talk interviewed this week [...] You are asking the same questions, [but] you might get a more colorful story.

(US based health researcher) As the example above show, the m eetings were not just in place for the sake of communication, but as much as a complement to team building. For the rare collaborations where the researcher  X  X o put a face to the name X  through video conferencing. Viewing successful collaborations mi ght seem obvious; however, the important point here is that it was not only the communication conveyed at the meetings that made collaborations; instead it was establishment of the meetings as routine and the routine around the meeting technology, that meant these meetings contributed to the successful collaboration. Earlier research into the prac tices of ethnographers emphasized the importance of  X  X eeing togethe r X  amongst fieldworkers [6], a sense that researchers share a developing view of what they are come to a consensus on what are the important aspects of the setting they are studying. This was as much the case in quantitative work as much as qualitative. Broadly in quantitative work there is a desire that the depends upon considerable work by the researchers [29]. yet participants might simply not understand the question and require some explanation before they can answer. This presents a challenge in terms of making sure that different participants are answering the same question. Or alternatively, participants might have their answers codified and it can be necessary to make considerable judgment about what answer fits into what category. This creates a need to work out a common approach across fieldworkers, but also there is a need for those analyzing the data to be aware of these continge ncies further down the process. Moving beyond the individual study there was a similar sense of seeing together for our long-term small group collaborators, but something that acted on a different scale than an individual study. For these groups what was key wa s not necessarily that those involved agreed as such, but that they came to define their problems, found similar aspects interesting, and that they characterized the research field in similar ways. Behind this there would of course be a certain level of agreement (researchers might come form the same intellectual school or tradition, or might have where productive work could be done, often through disagreements, and the resolv ing of those disagreements. This common viewpoint came in part from working together over a long period of time -not only reading the same pieces, or discussing them together, but also reflecting on others X  positions -particularly how this came out in writing together. For example, one academic met his close collaborator during his PhD through a shared advisor, and they now worked together on nearly all their research projects. So even academic relationships that might be characterized by large amount of agreement -agr eement in the sense of seeing together the academic field. For students of our researchers, frequently their  X  X ob X  as such was to try and understand and come to see the worldview of their advisor. Indeed, most of our researchers considered themselves still  X  X ttached X  in some way to their advisor in that they had inherited their view of the field. This might not be something that they would agree with, or even that they might share, but to understa nd the subtly and complexity of a particular viewpoint on a research field proves to be valuable training for future academic work. Seeing together also constituted a common view of collaboration technologies, what was appropriate to use and what was working well for their specific collaboration practices. Obviously Internet based information search and em ail were the major players in terms of research collaboration technologies, but data collection see together. One professor explai ns about a collea gue who enjoys programming, even though he potent ially could hire people to do that work: which is a programming language .

[...] So, when he and I work together, I push yesterday when we went to lu nch,  X  X y favorite programs are when I X  X  the research assistant. X  He is a leading researcher. The creation of the statistical equations and programming measures contribute to the rese archers common understanding of the data and helps them view their data from specific perspectives. We now continue describing some of the challenges that the researchers encountered in their research practices in relation to research coordination. Fieldwork practices relied heavily not only on the researchers X  own individual previous and estab lished practices but also on the practices and influences of collaborators. This often posed challenges at different stages in the projects from the initiation to the writing up of results. We found it valuable for the analysis to explore our data in terms of st ructural challenges. We have projects, the collection of information and data from electronic sources, access to fieldwork sites, fieldwork practices affecting the results and sharing data. the project, gaining funding and institutional approval. Fieldwork based projects present a particular challenge here in that the nature the study being conducted. Yet the requirements of funders for a clear overview and plan for the work -can conflict with the problematic even in the most structured and quantitative of studies where applications for funding might require an outline of all the questions that will be asked -even though it might be desirable for these questions to emerge from preliminary work. This can also off X  before the start of empirical work. The challenges herein were particularly profound among the Scandinavian researchers who had been involved in EU projects. These often require a specific va riety of partners in different countries and areas of Europe; such requirement resulted in having to  X  X old-call X  research colleagues unfamiliar to the participants or being involved in projects mainly because of their geographical position. One of the Swedish professors explained a situation: EU] are forcing a structure upon you [...] What happens is that someone somehow now ... this was in Barcelona, got an idea. Here we have a possibility to get a lo t of EU money, [...] so this is an opportunity for us to do some research around the subjects focused around the strategy in some kind of form. [...] What they do then is  X  X eah, we should apply, but we need partners X . So then they sent out, often just by email  X  X i this is [name] from England X . Interviewer: People y ou don X  X  necessarily know? Well, no, I know him, but not the others down there. So they continues like that. But then the EU forces you to formulate your superficial... These projects were not based on long-term collaborations or tight-knit colleagues and were more likely to encounter problems, as also described above. The challenges were particularly attempted to gauge one another in terms of motivations and planned effort. Communication betw een partners was key, but it was rare to see actual workshop based meetings in the initial phase of projects. Instead the researchers communicated almost solely via email until the funding was acquired and then they met at so-called  X  X ick-off meetings X . A profoundly technological challenge to fieldwork research was an activity also often taking place initially in a project. Even though all of our participants conducted fieldwork with human subjects, all project included phases of collection of electronic material in libraries and pictur e material through electronic of analog networks. A few of the researchers based the majority of their research on mainly electronically available data. Unsurprisingly all of the researchers used Internet based information search, but some needed more structured data than others. Here, limitations intro duced themselves as problems accessing the right data through library websites and the data sometimes being constrained to access from within the actual libraries, making it necessary to work together either in the library or make sure enough notes was in order for a collaborator to understand the original data. A US based researcher for example, DC to collect archived law material from the 19th century. These documents were not online and only available at the Library of Congress; the travel to Washington DC always meant a cross-country flight adding significantl y to his research expenses. Although the information collection was at times problematic, the researchers showed a significant ability to  X  X ork around the systems X , to find a way to get the information they needed. This is in many ways of course the esse nce of fieldwork research, but we long-term small group collaborations ; researchers relied to a large them and help out in complicated cases. A third set of problems emerge d around access to particular be arranged in advance it is al ways contingent on changes in personnel, or simply the changing conditions of the field-site. One of our social scientists, for exam ple, was studying shopping habits in supermarkets. She relied on the particular supermarket manager X  X  cooperation ea ch time she went out in the field to interview shoppers, even though she had a general permission from the greater company who were partners in the project. She found it frustrating that some times they were allowed to video-record customers (after customers X  permission of course) but other problem of access was encountered by another researcher who accommodation for outpatients who lived too far away to commute. Not only was she continuously denied access to the collaboration with when submitting a funding proposal, she also felt she was approached with hostility from nurses and staff when she finally gained access to the hospital accommodation house that agreed to talk to her were very welcoming and approachable and she was able to collect data through interviews and observations with them. Thes e examples illustrate how importance; also the collaboratio n between researchers and people people of power to grant access ca n readily change their policy. Four of our researchers worked with vulnerable populations, making use of public places (homel ess, transexuals, drug addicts) for  X  X treet X  recruitment. This involved walking up to  X  X ikely X  individuals in settings where the groups of interest were known to inhabit. To get around problems of commitment in these settings invitation for the main interview. While this at least increased the proportion of potential interview ees, screening interviewees on environment. Interviewing only t hose available and willing  X  X n lamented as skewing the sample of informants. This set of challenges is characteristic of a great deal of fieldwork organization of the fieldwork to a further extent than planned and desired. So although the researchers managed to work around obstacles of recruitment and access, the fact that such settings are problematic to navigate in the first place meant that collaborating with other researchers on these projects was not contributing to the main challenges within the proj ect, except conflicts internally about what kind of access had originally been negotiated. Two communication X  that occasionally influenced their access to the field sites. investigates, but it also presents  X  X veryday fieldwork problems X  that need be resolved. The actual collection itself ofte n presented its own challenges and trade-offs. For example, one of our social scientists was video recording the interactions of children in a museum -she knew she got more useful data from using a head mounted camera on her certain extent affected by the presence of the camera. This researcher explained in length how small the camera was, but admitted that the children constantly commented on the fact that they were being recorded when interacting with the camera-mounted child. For our researchers who had more structured projects an ongoing challenge was in managing how que stions were asked, and how the answers that were given were translated into results. Behind the survey can be used to say that a set number of individual had a certain behavior or opinion. Yet this rests on making comparable lie behind the survey questions must in some way connect with the behaviors that are being surveyed. One technology that had received widespread use was digital audio recorders -the different fieldworkers we interviewed all collected large corpuses of audio data from their fieldwork. Yet but more as a safeguard should data be lost from the other ways in which it was collected. The key pr oblem with audio was that it was difficult to index and access -in particular there was no way of comparing audio data by (say ) question asked. Moreover, since transcribing audio data was expensive and difficult to arrange audio data usually remained an under exploited resource. For our researchers who used video data they shared the data through online repositories or simply by viewing it together with others or sending a selected snippet to a collaborator. As with audio, video also was a frustrating material to work with in that it was extremely time consuming to re view and to analyze. As one researcher expressed:  X  X ften [our] qualitative data isn X  X  used because they end up with hundreds of hours of tape and no the quantitative survey data they had recorded within their system. Perhaps the key problem for research though turned on how questions were asked, understo od and answered. Key to good survey research is asking the sa me question the same way across all the different participants who are being interviewed. Yet different participants might unders tand questions in very different ways, or simply not understand the question. This requires the researcher to explain what the question means. While this might seem unproblematic, it can lead to slightly different questions being asked. For example, a term such as  X  X exual partner X  might interviewer and interviewee. The order that a question is asked number of sexual partners follows a set of questions about oral likely to get a higher answer than if it is asked individually. Questions are also answered in different ways. Most surveys are designed with a small set of answers to each question so as to support the comparability of answ ers between those interviewed. convert the answers given to standa rdized answers. Yet if there is more than one fieldworker, or if interviews are being done in different places, it can be difficult to ensure any sort of regularity between interviews. I worked on a survey last year where they changed the instrument all the time. And it was such a mess. It just ended up, you couldn X  X  use 10% of the questions. It X  X  a re ally difficult. People talk about quant data as if it X  X  the guiding light, of real and true. Whatever. And it X  X  just not at all if you X  X e got people asking people. People ask the questions differently. interviews with the goal of being able to  X  X ack track X  should there be any problems with the questi ons being asked. Yet this was rarely done because of the difficulty of sharing and accessing audio f iles. More open ended or qualitative work was not immune from these problems either -most ethnographic work relies upon comparability between different se ttings that might in many ways be quite distinct. While there is not the strong commitment to straightforward simple comparability, ethnographers who worked together resorted instead to sh aring fieldnotes and summaries of interviews as a way of making sure that the other researchers shared a similar viewpoint on the field [6]. A final challenge emerged when the researchers were ready to share (empirical) data with their collaborators for discussion and analysis. Their physical and digitally mediated meetings were sorts. Fieldworkers often upload data in different forms, such as input from questionnaires in the fi eld. We were struck by the reliance of the different researchers we studied on the uploading and downloading of data to servers. Participants used a multitude of tools -FTP, Sharepoint, Entryware, emailing files around and uploading video files. While there were shortcomings in all these mechanisms, and the mechanisms used were relatively crude, data sharing was not identified as a problem for research as such. Indeed, current technologies successfully supported a background expectation amongst those working together that their data was shared as it was collected. Yet, the lack of structure and generally accepted data sharing formats introduced problems for the collaborations, particularly the large-scale ones. In a cross-country country and electronically in the ot her. The researchers we talked to were unable to get an overvie w of the paper-based material acted as a background to other in teractions around the fieldwork project -data was important but could not be understood if shared without further interactions. While many of these practices described will be familiar to readers, our broader sample presents some interesting insights. It is important to point out that by describing these collective practices we are addressing a mo re diverse set of fieldwork researchers than what one indivi dual could describe in terms of own experiences. These practices are important to trace and collaboration technology design. This brings on the subject of how, more specifically, technologies can be used to support the different fieldwork and collaboration practices that we ha ve outlined so far.

The use of cloud storage is also a defining feature. Advantages are effective and simple data maintaining, distribution, and support for collaboration. With cloud storage the service provider handles no need for manual management of the storage and configuration of the system. Disadvantages include potential issues with bandwidth, performance, reliability and availability and that some projects may have very specific records-keeping requirements. TagPad is designed to address only a subset of the reported the larger collaboration structures at place among social science researchers. However, we do believe that a tool like TagPad has potential in terms of improving some research activities that have been discussed here. Drawing on interviews this pa per has documented different collaborative aspects of science research practice. We focused on the sociality of social science fieldwork practice -how is that social science collaboration de pends upon small group long term collaboration. The paper went on to document how collaboration practices were arranged -the amount of coupling of different parts importance of  X  X eeing together X  of researchers being able to share a viewpoint on what was important in their research field. From this we documented specific ch allenges in terms of research practices and how technologies are involved in the fieldwork. It is important to highlight how our results add to a growing field of cyberinfrastructures and group technologies but by addressing a more qualitative research space. Much other relevant research focuses on information workers and their collaboration tools but the profound characteristics of social science researchers have of exploring the fieldwork research technology space and while many of our findings overlap with the findings from those two suggest designs for technology for small-scale fieldwork. TagPad, for empirical data collection and initial analysis, particularly focused on small-scale close coll aborations. It is designed to particular collaborative intervie w based fieldwork projects. We are currently studying TagPad amongst a number of different publications. Beyond the implications of this work for cyber-infrastructure it is worth considering how different models of research practice inform funding decisions and the organization of funding councils, as well as more broadly support for academic and are smaller and more longer term th an science, this would suggest quite different arrangements to how we currently organize much of the support for collaborative scientific practice.
