 take into account the lifetime of items, which might lead to some unfair measurement. We explain the incurred problems with the following illustrative examples. Example 1. Without considering the lifespan of transaction items, some discovered in-visited in a web user session. Let the suppor t threshold be 0.4. Based on traditional However, since page E is published in Aug 05, it is unfair to compute support of item-pairs containing page E with respect to the complete dat abase, which contains records associations discovered for { A, E } are not valid.
 Example 2. Without considering the lifespan of transaction items, some valid indirect associations may not be covered. The traditional indirect association model discovers occurs frequently together with the two items respectively. Since the pair of itemset {
E, F } in Figure 1 is infrequent, we need to search whether there exists a mediator itemset M such that E and F are indirectly associated via M . Consider the itemset { { Thus, { B, C } should be considered as a candidate mediator while traditional indirect association misses it.

For the purpose of incorporating lifespan of items, the measures involved in tra-ditional indirect association, support and dependence [6], need to be extended to be temporal. We now define the temporal measures as follows.
 Definition 2 (Temporal Support). Let D be a temporal transaction database on I is defined as: Then the temporal support of X , denoted as TSup ( X ) , can be computed as TSup ( X, S ( X )) .
 That is, the temporal support of an itemset X is the ratio of the number of transac-riod of X . For example, consider the temporal tr ansaction database in Figure 1. Let ported by three transactions while there are seven transactions starting from p 2 . Definition 3 (Temporal Dependence). Let D be a temporal transaction database on temporal dependence between X and Y , denoted as TDep ( X, Y ) , is defined as: Since the correlation between two attributes makes sense only when both attributes ex-ist, we calculate the probability of X and Y (in the denominator) with respect to the value of temporal dependence, the more positive correlation between the two itemsets. For example, consider the two temporal itemsets X = { B, C } and Y = { E } in Fig-is 4 / 7 and TSup ( Y, p 2 ) is 5 / 7 ,the TDep ( X, Y ) = 3 / 7  X 
Based on the temporal support and temporal dependence extended above, the tem-poral indirect association can be defined as follows.
 Definition 4 (Temporal Indirect Association). A temporal itempair { x, y } is a tem-if the following conditions are satisfied: 1. TSup ( { x, y } ) &lt;t s ( Itempair Support Condition ) . 2. TSup ( { x } X  M )  X  t f , TSup ( { y } X  M )  X  t f (Mediator Support Condition). 3. TDep ( { x } ,M )  X  t d , TDep ( { y } ,M )  X  t d (Mediator Dependence Condition). and mediator dependence threshold respectively.
 1 / &lt;E,F |{ B, C } &gt; is a temporal indirect association pattern.

Let D be a temporal transaction database over a sequence of problem of temporal indirect a ssociation mining is to discover the complete set of t ;2) TSup ( { x } X  M )  X  t f , TSup ( { y } X  M )  X  t f ;3) TDep ( { x } ,M )  X  t d , TDep ( { y } ,M )  X  t d . In this section, we discuss the algorithm for temporal indirect association mining. We support temporal transaction database. 3.1 Indirect Association Mining An algorithm called HI-Mine was proposed in [7] to use the divide-and-conquer strat-egy to discover mediators. However, HI-Mine generates a complete set of mediators for such that both items depend on it.

Basically, we first construct a frequency graph whichisusedtofind infrequent item-quent itempair, we then construct a mediator graph with these possible mediator items. Then, the complete set of mediators for the infrequent itempair will be generated from the mediator graph.

We use a vertical bitmap representation for the database. For example, consider the be absolute support threshold).
 Definition 5 (Frequency Graph). Given a database D on itemset I , and the user de-fined mediator (itempair) support threshold t f , a frequency graph, denoted as FG = (
N, E ) , can be constructed such that N is a set of nodes representing frequent items { x | b ( x )  X  t Otherwise, it is infrequent.
 ( a ) are frequent and the constructed frequency graph is shown in Figure 2 ( b ) where infrequent edges are drawn in dashed lines.

Traverse edges in a frequency graph . For each infrequent edge, which corresponds to an infrequent itempair, we collect a set of candidate mediator nodes . Definition 6 (Candidate Mediator Node). Given a frequency graph FG =( N, E ) , is a set of nodes: { n | b ( n )  X  b ( x )  X  t f ,b ( n )  X  b ( y )  X  t f ,n  X  N } . Then, a mediator graph for an infrequent edge can be constructed with the set of can-didate mediator nodes.
 Definition 7 (Mediator Graph). Given a frequency graph FG and an infrequent edge ( (
N, E ) ,where N is a set of nodes such that N = MN ( x, y ) and E is a set of directed originating from m if m precedes n according to lexicographical order, is frequent if b ( m )  X  b ( n )  X  t f .
 For example, the mediator graph constructed for infrequent edge ( A, C ) is shown in Figure 2 ( c ) . Likewise, infrequent edges are shown in dashed lines.

From the mediator graph MG ( A, C ) , we now present how to compute the set of medi-3 / 5 because b ( A )  X  b ( B )=3 . dependence ( A, B ) support ( { A,B } )  X  0 . 77 . The support and the dependence between C and B can be calculated similarly and we discover an indirect association pattern &lt;A,C |{ B } &gt; .

The remaining nodes in the mediator grap h that have frequent edges originating from node B consist of B s conditional mediator base , from which we construct B s conditional mediator graph . For each node n in the conditional mediator graph conditional mediator graph of node B . Then, we compute the mediators involving B , represents the support of { BD } now) while the support and dependence between C is given in Figure 3 ( a ) . 3.2 Temporal Indirect Association Mining Based on the measure of temporal support , a frequency graph consisting of frequent items can be constructed similarly. For example, let the threshold of temporal support be 0.4. The constructed frequency graph is shown in Figure 4 ( b ) .

Before discussing how to construct a mediator graph for an infrequent itempair, we highlight that the downward closure property does not hold for mediator discovery in asshowninFigure4 ( c ) , the complete set of mediators M of an infrequent itempair { subsets as shown in the figure: M = M p i  X  M p i +1  X  X  X  X  X  M p n ,where M p i = { as counting bases (for computing temporal support and temporal dependence of x and for discovering different subsets of mediators.

Consider the frequency graph in Figure 4 ( b ) . We now explain how to discover me-infrequent, there is no candidate mediator nodes and the graph is empty. Then, we con-struct the mediator graph for mining M p 2 , which involves items D and B because the that, D is an extendable mediator node while B is non-extendable 1 . The constructed mediator graph is shown in Figure 4 ( d ) , where non-extendable nodes are depicted in dashed lines. From this graph, we recursively examine whether { D } and { D, B } are in Figure 3 ( b ) . In this section, we evaluate the performance of developed algorithms. All experiments are conducted on a 2 GHz P4 machine with 512M main memory, which runs Microsoft Windows XP. All the algorithms are implemented in C++. In order to obtain compa-rable experimental results, the method we em ployed to generate synthetic datasets is ally, we use the notation T x.Iy.Dz.P n to represent a temporal transaction database which is over a sequence of n periods.
 Comparison of MG-Growth and HI-Mine . we compare the performance of MG-Growth with HI-Mine , which is the clear winner of the other existing algorithms [7]. ual items. Consequently, HI-Mine needs to discover all the set the mediators for more items no matter whether these mediators are useful or not. On the contrary, MG-Growth formance of MG-Growth will not deteriorate significantly with the decrease of mediator (itempair) support threshold.

We further examine the scale-up feature of MG-Growth . Figure 5 ( c ) shows the results with the variation of data size from 200 K to 1 M . The scale-up performance under two different thresholds of t f are studied. The execution times are normalized time of MG-Growth increases slightly with the growt h of data size, which demonstrated the good scalability of MG-Growth .
 Comparison of TMG-Growth and THI-Mine . In order to evaluate the performance of the temporal version of MG-Growth , TMG-Growth , we also extend the HI-Mine to support temporal transaction database [2]. Correspondingly, we denote the temporal version of HI-Mine as THI-Mine . We compare the performance of TMG-Growth and MG-Growth outperforms the temporal version of HI-Mine as well. When the number of support threshold is large.

We evaluate the quality of temporal indirect association patterns by comparing the results of the traditional model and the temporal model on the same temporal transac-old, where black blocks depict the percentage of patterns shared by two models, white blocks depict the percentage of patterns missed by the traditional model and the gray tional model. In this paper, we take into account the lifespan of items to explore a new model of temporal indirect association. We first develop an algorithm MG-Growth for indirect association mining. Under MG-Growth , a set of mediators are generated only if both items in an infrequent itempair depend on them. Then, we extend the framework of Our experimental results showed that MG-Growth outperforms the existing algorithm efficiently.
