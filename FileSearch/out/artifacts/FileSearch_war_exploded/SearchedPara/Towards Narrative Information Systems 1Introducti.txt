 Information systems form the backbone of most Web applications enabling access to providing relevant information as opposed to retrieving relevant documents [1]. 
Stories are particularly well suited to communicate complex and multi-facetted in-formation in an easy-to-understand and easy-to-memorize fashion. They exhibit a plot feedback and directive cues of her audience under consideration. or edge available for this purpose. more text snippets representing brief descriptions or explanations. 
A plot graph  X   X  is given by  X   X   X  X , X , X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X , node labels (topic names), and a finite set  X   X  of edge labels.

Finally, we have a set of text snippets  X  X  , and the relations  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  assigning snippets to nodes (topics) and transitions (sub-topics). each possible plot graph  X   X  being an edge-induced subgraph of graph, a user can search its collectio n by issuing a query featuring a topic contains topics and transitions relevant with respect to the query topic .

In experiment 2, both groups were asked to rate the following four questions on a life X ,  X  X ow does my life change if I got pregnant X , or  X  X ow does my life change if my user ratings for each question individually with group means and compared them with an independent sample t-test. Conditions of normal distribution are assumed due to a sample size of at least 30 per group, homogeneity of variances was given (Levene X  X ). All differences between the group means were not significant. 
Our results show that even na X ve prototypes of Narrative Information Systems can cally reduce the cognitive burden by directly presenting relevant information in form of relationships between topics and by reducing the texts the user has to read. These
