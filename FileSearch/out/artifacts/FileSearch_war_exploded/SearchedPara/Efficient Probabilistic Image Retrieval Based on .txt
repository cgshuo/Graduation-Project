 research, besides widely adopted visual features, some conceptual ones such as style , databases. Fig. 1 shows an example garment retrieval application, in which two identified by users as two different styles such as  X  Vogue X  and  X  Elegant X  . Moreover, in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), two different sentiments,  X  X appy X  and  X  Sad X  , are conveyed in two images, respectively. Often, users would like to retrieve some images with a specific method that combines visual and conceptual features together to facilitate image retrieval. 
In fact, due to the content complexity of an image, personal knowledge level, and and Japanese-like  X  are 60%, 25%, 5%, and 10%; while user-provided probabilistic confidences are 70%, 60%, 65%, and 75%, respectively. Given another example 5%, 5%, 75%, 10%, and 5%, with confidences 75%, 65%, 60%, 70%, and 60%, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a more sophisticated probabilistic model to represent the conceptual features of an image effectively. 
After addressing the retrieval effectiveness issue by modeling images with both relates to the problem of high-dimensional data indexing with multiple features. Although considerable research efforts have been done on high-dimensional indexing combined feature-based images retrieval due to the existence of the probabilistic data. 
To address this issue, we propose a probabilistic and mixed high-dimensional MFP-Tree index, the issue of a probabilistic k nearest neighbor(P k NN) query of image  X  q in a high-dimensional space can be solved by transforming it into a range query in the single dimensional space. The primary contributions of this paper are as follows: 2. We introduce a M ixed-F eature P robabilistic-Tree (MFP-Tree)-based indexing 3. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some background of our work. Section 3 presents our preprocessing steps of our method. In Section 4, we propose a M ixed F eature-based P robabilistic Tree (MFP-Tree)-based effectiveness of our approach, before we conclude in the final section. Q
BIC [1] was known as the first system to support content-based image retrieval. After that, many prototype systems have been built, such as V IRAGE [2], Photobook [3], and M such as color histogram, texture, and shapes are adopted, without considering systems, users often want to retrieve images that are not only visually similar, but also traditional C BIR techniques from a perspective of feature subjectivity. hierarchical tree index structure. However, their performance becomes unsatisfactory [9]. Alternatively, iDistance [10] is a distance-based approach. Recently, Jagadish et al. [11] have devised an indexing method to facilitate the similar retrieval using multiple features. Worse still, these indexing approaches are only suitable for indexing multi-dimensional data without probabilistic components. Feature uncertainty is often neglected, which is testified to be inherent in many real applications including feature features with uncertainty components so far. 3.1 Modeling an Image conceptual features of an image, there exists a number of different styles and sentiments, respectively (see Figs. 1 and 2). Thus the image I i can be represented by a four-tuple: where  X  i refers to the i -th image in  X  ;  X  Vfea refers to the visual features of the image such as color histogram, texture,  X  Sty={StyID, StyName, StyVal, P  X  Senti={ SenID, SenName, SenVal, P To fully utilize these two features to effectively prune the search space, we propose a probabilistic retrieval scheme in which the style and sentiment of each image can be identified by users in the preprocessing step. visual vector, i  X  [1,n] and j  X  [1,d]; d is the dimension of the VIV. SV below. j dimension of the SEV. 10%&gt;. So the sentiment similarity distance ( seSim ) of the two images is as follows. 3.2 Building a Probabilistic Model 3.2.1 Learning from User X  X  Log with probabilistic confidences, thus I R i can be represented by a five-tuple: example of user X  X  log in which id refers to the image ID and Uid is the user ID. 
Suppose t users are involved in the selection of the conceptual features. Then, the average probabilistic confidence( Conf X ) can be derived as: where X can be ST (i.e., style), or SE (i.e., sentiment). 3.2.2 Feature Probability and Confidence Distribution Table defined as follows. parts: where i refers to the image ID, Fname is the feature name (such as style and sentiment), value equals to Fval, and Conf X means the average user co nfidence of the conceptual feature (X can be style or sentiment) . Table 5 shows an example of the FPCDT in which the probabilities that the style and confidence( Conf X ) guarantee. processing step, in order to obtain the FPCDT of each image, we propose a multi-reference-based probability propagation (MRPP) method, in which m images are these reference images are first manually obtained through the interactions of users. For reference images of them with respect to the visual feature distance. Definition 5 (Affected Reference Image Region, ARIR ) . Given an image I i , its affected radius  X  in the visual feature space.
 number of affected reference images. equals to Y can be derived as: where as follows: where the symbols (e.g., X , Y, and  X  ) are defined the same as in Eq.(5). I I and I R2 . So  X  = 2 .
 Eqs.(5) and (6), then we have: 
Prob (The style feature value of I 3 =  X  Vogue  X ) =  X  =  X +  X   X  X   X  0.0097=0.97% where  X  1 =  X  2 =1/2. Since 0.97%+1.9%+10%+1.1% = 13.97%&lt;100%, so we need to conduct a uniform process of the probability values. The uniform probability values are shown in Fig.4(c). 
For the image I 3 , the confidence that its corresponding style feature value is  X  Vogue  X  can be derived as follows: = = Fig.4(c). ( M ixed-F eature-based P robabilistic Tree ) to facilitate an image retrieval method with probabilistic confidence guarantee. 4.1 Motivation and Preliminaries information file. denoted as CR j .
 O O is the centroid image of cluster C j , CR j is the cluster radius. 
Once T clusters are obtained, then the distance between each image and its identified at the same time. Finally, a uniform index key of an image is obtained to be discussed in Section 4.3. 4.2 Determining Weights by Multivariable Regression Note that when we construct the mixed feature vectors using linear concatenation from vectors, we cannot assume that each type of visual and conceptual features contributes different roles for effective image retrieval. 
Some earlier research work on image retrieval and the evaluation of image similarity scheme to determine the weight for each feature based on multivariable regression. In written as below, feature. 4.3 The Data Structure In order to effectively prune the search region, we propose the MFP-Tree , a probabilistic mixed-feature indexing scheme. For the user query, there are four cases in terms of query element which are shown below. So for each image I i , its index key can be defined as: 
For case 1 (e.g., A query image ), we have For case 2 (e.g., A query image + its style ), we have For case 3 (e.g., A query image + its sentiment ), we have And for the last case (e.g., A query image + its style + its sentiment ), we have Eqs. (8)-(11) can be obtained by using the multi-variable regression method introduced in Section 4.2. 
Since the images are grouped into T clusters, to get a uniform index key of image in different clusters, the index key in Eqs. (8-11) can be rewritten by Eq. (12): guaranteed that the search range of key( I i ) is not overlapped. 
To facilitate retrieving images via submitting an auxiliary information (e.g, the style, or sentiment name) of I i with probabilistic confidence, its index keys can be rewritten in Eq. (13): independent indexes. In order to incorporate them into an integral one, we derive a new uniform index key expression by adding four stretch constants(i.e., C 1 to C 4 ) shown in Eq. (14): overlap with one another. 
For an image, its two values of StyID and SenID are recorded in the corresponding index 4.4 Probabilistic k -NN Retrieval Algorithm in distance to a given image with a confidence threshold. In this section, we focus on PKNN In this section, we present an extensive performance study to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed retrieval and indexing method. The image data we used are garment images extracted from Taobao.com [12] of about 50,000 images. We have effectiveness of our proposed retrieval method by comparing with a conventional one [1]. The retrieval approach and the MFP-Tree index are implemented in C language in B sequential scan without index support. 5.1 Effect of m precision ratio. Fig. 11 demonstrates that with the increase of the number of reference images, the precision ratio increases gradually. When the number of reference images beyond 220, the precision ratio does not increase any more. This is because the number confidence distribution will be more accurate with the increase of  X  . 5.2 Effect of Data Size In this experiment, we measured the performance behavior with varying number of images. Fig. 12a shows the performance of query processing in terms of CPU cost. It is evident that the MFP-Tree outperforms sequential scan significantly. The CPU cost of MFP-Tree increases slowly as the data size grows. It is worth mentioning that the result reveals that the I/O cost of MFP-Tree is superior to sequential scan. 5.3 Effect of k In the final experiment, we proceed to evaluate the effect of k on the performance of a from 10 to 40, the MFP-Tree is superior to other methods in terms of page access and CPU-intensive task. The CPU cost of sequential scan is ignored due to the expensive computation cost of it. In this paper, we presented a framework to support a mixed-feature-based image the retrieval performance of the large image databases. The prototype retrieval system approach to image retrieval. 
In our future work, we will extend our work to the social media applications such as probability-model-based personalized social media retrieval. For this kind of social provided by users, which are uncertain to some degree.
