 ferent domains. We firstly extract the form texts and structure by using FIE algorithm. apply AP clustering algorithm to cluster th ese forms according to the similarity meas-ure (FGSTD) we proposed. tween texts and form structure; the approach to calculate the similarity of forms based clustering algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms exist-ing ones. P. Senellart [1] proposed to classify data sources by probing HTML forms guided by domain knowledge and heuristic rules. B.He [2] exploited anchor attributes of query schemas without considering the relation between texts in an interface. What X  X  more, we adopt an unsupervised AP clustering algorithm. Luciano Barbosa [3] proposed to classify forms according to texts in forms in a supervised way. Anne H. Ngu [4] pro-genomics research. Yiyao Lu [5] utilized the available features on the interface page clustering algorithm which assumed that K is known beforehand. similarity measure evaluating the frequent-itemset group of a form is proposed and an unsupervised AP clustering algorithm is adopted to cluster query interfaces. of sources of the same domain tends to converge. Here we report another two obser-vations which motivated our approach. manifest that some texts in the same domain tend to co-occur. Second, we can deter-same text appearing in different interfaces. The statistic is shown in Fig. 2. nents of it: form information extraction, frequent-itemset group generation and simi-larity computation and forms clustering. (1) Form information extraction locations. We mark the word from tag as T , one from select control as S , one from checkbox B and one from radio button R . F denotes a query interface form and W and propose FIE algorithm based on the definition. can be denoted as a set of items IS = Input: a form F , threshold 1 W , 2 W , 3 W Output: a set of items IS (2) Frequent-itemset group generation and similarity computation For a form F whose IS is formed as: frequent itemsets we use Itemsets Dimensionality (ID) and Group Dimensionality frequent-itemset group respectively.

Due to inconstancy of ID, traditional similarity measure can X  X  work well. Our first method is described as follows: 
FIG and 2 FIG . However, this method doesn X  X  consider complexity of frequent-itemset group. data object (frequent itemsets). We regard data object as a particle in p dimensional-ity and the gravitation between particles as similarity between two frequent itemsets. 
Given two datasets nite function defined in space  X  ; (2) decreasing function to the distance between their data objects. fine is the weight of the i th dimensionality frequent itemsets and  X  is the sum of different dimensionality similarities. For dimensionality is defined as: consider not only whether the string is matched ( (, ) according to a text locations appearing in two forms (5). (3) Forms clustering After obtaining all similarities between each frequent-itemset group, we can generate a FIG matrix. Then FIG s are clustered by AP cluster method algorithm. We adopt the dataset composed of forms in the TEL-8 dataset [6]. As with B.He X  X , we collected 443 sources over 8 domains (Airfares, Hotels, Car Rentals, Books, Movies, Music Records, Jobs and Automobiles) and totally 1263 frequent itemsets at support 0, the better the result is. 5.1 Experimental Results We design four group of experiments abbreviated as Af, Ht, Jb, Am, Bk, Cr, Mv and Mr to denote the 8 domains respectively. 
First, we evaluate the influence of preference in AP clustering shown in Fig. 3. The result (a) shows that the higher the preference is, the more clustering groups are. (b) much lower than B. He X  X  (0.34) as 7 p = X  (F: AP FGSTD , M: hac M D ).Third, we com-pare location-marked cluster result with location-unmarked result in Fig. 5, the preci-sion of AP FGSTD is slightly higher and more stable than B. He X  X  and much higher than and FGSTD greatly improves the precision. In this paper we study data sources classification with domain independent. Motivated itemsets, we develop a novel similarity measure (FGSTD) guided by which, we group of form text co-occurrence relation and structure and FGSTD method. Acknowledgments.
