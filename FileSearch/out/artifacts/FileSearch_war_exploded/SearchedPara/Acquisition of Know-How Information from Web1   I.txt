 A variety of know-how such as recipes and solutions for troubles have been stored on the Web and they are often referred to by using web search. It has been reported that about 40% of all non-factoid questions on Q&amp;A sites are how-to questions [8], and the know-how information has potential to give us the answers to the questions. However, it is not so easy to appropriately find know-how information related to a particular how-to question. If know-how could be appropriately det ected, it would become easy to find answers to how-to ques-tions. Also, it would become possible to let us know how to tackle unforeseen situations if know-how information could be stored beforehand and classified into several classes according to their topics.

In this research, we assume that know-how is a procedure or an advice. Figure 1 shows two examples of know-how. In previous researches, know-how informa-tion was acquired by using typical words such as  X  X ow to X  and clue words such as  X  X nly if X  and  X  X irst X  [10]. However, it is difficult to efficiently acquire know-how information based on the conventional methods because a variety of clue expressions are required to appropriat ely detect know-how information which is often described without using clue words or the typical words  X  X rocedure X ,  X  X ow to X  and  X  X irst X  as you can see in Figure 1.

Well then, what is a clue to efficiently obtaining know-how information? Our observation for this question is as follows. Firstly, know-how information often includes at least one object that plays an important role; for instance,  X  X air dryer X  in the first example and  X  X hermometer X  in the second one in Figure 1. Secondly, the typical usage of the object is often described in each know-how; for instance,  X  X o heat something X  in the first example, and  X  X o monitor a temperature X  in the second one. As s een in the examples, know-how is often characterized by an object name and the description of its usage. We examined 100 lists of know-how information randomly sampled from a web site 1 and found that 75 out of the 100 lists included at least one object and the description of its usage. This supports our intuition.

In this paper, we propose a method for acquiring know-how information by focusing on each object and how it is used . First, we extract passages containing at least one target object and then extract candidates for know-how from them. Then, lists of know-how information are acquired based on the description of the object and its typical usage. In previous works, a few studies have addressed the acquisition of procedural texts. Takechi et al. proposed a method to categorize HTML texts tagged with OL or UL as either procedural or non-procedural by using word N-grams [7]. Aouladomar proposed a method to estimate questionability of web texts by using tag information (title, advice, warning, etc.) annotated by rule-base methods [2,3] and clue expressions [1]. Yin et al . proposed a method for measuring the degree of procedurality of texts containing the phrase  X  X ow to X  by using syntactic tags, morphological tags and cue phrases [10].
 In this study, we acquire procedures and advices as know-how information. Our proposed method uses not only clue expressions which were also used in previous works but also an object and how it is used. Aouladomar classified procedural texts into three categories [1]; procedures (e.g. recipes, maintenance and construction manuals, etc.), injunctions (e.g. orders, regulations, etc.), and advices (e.g. b eauty advices, health management meth-ods, etc.). In this research, we acquire procedures and advices as know-how in-formation since they are frequently a sked on Q&amp;A sites, namely there are many demands to obtain information on procedures and advices.
 We acquire know-how information by focusing on an object and how it is used. In this research, we assume that objects are noun phrases which are hyponym of  X  X hysical entity X  in Japanese WordNet 1.1 2 . We use expressions represent-ing utilization of an object (utilization roles) to capture how the object is used. For example, the utilization role of  X  X air dryer X  is to  X  X eat X  and that of  X  X her-mometer X  is to  X  X onitor. X  Figure 2 illustrates the flow for acquiring know-how information. We assume that a unit of know-how is a passage since know-how is very often composed of multiple sentences, but it is not always composed of all sentences in a document. We also assume that lists of know-how information are acquired for each object. First, giv en a target object, the candidate passages for know-how are extracted by using several methods since most passages would not contain know-how information. Then, the candidates are classified as either they contain know-how information or not by using clue patterns, an object and its utilization roles.
In the following sections, we assume that the target language is Japanese because know-how information is not well organized yet, although the method can be expanded to any languages. We used the Web corpus consisting of 500M Japanese parsed sentences extracted aut omatically from the Web [5]. The sen-tences in the corpus have been automatically annotated with morphological and syntactic information. The syntactic information in a sentence is represented as a dependency structure between Japanese phrasal units, bunsetsu . 3.1 Extraction of Know-How Candidates First, passages are extracted in the following way. Every segment that contains at least one target object and is enclosed by a pair of the following HTML tags is extracted: If the number of sentences contained in a segment is less than or equal to a threshold  X  , the segment is extracted as a passage. Otherwise, we split the segment into one or more passages with the TextTiling algorithm [4] using  X  as the window size. This is because there exist Web sites where HTML tags are used incorrectly.

Next, the candidate passages that might contain know-how information are extracted. They are extracted by using t he following four conventional methods (A,B,C,D) and our proposed method (E). Multiple methods are used since the acquired know-how information might be limited when only one method is used. We take the union of the candidate passages as the candidates for know-how. (A) Extraction of the passages containing the term houhou (how to) [10] 3 . (B) Extraction of the passages tagged with OL or UL tags [7]. (C) Extraction of the passages containing any of 47 expressions (e.g.  X  X n order (D) Extraction of the passages containing any of 638 expressions such as (E) Extraction of the passages containing any of 3-tuples which are composed 3.2 Identification of Know-How The extracted candidates are classified as either they contain know-how in-formation or not by using a machine learning model. Clue patterns, part-of-speech information, target objects and their utilization roles (3-tuple) are used as features 4 .  X  clue patterns  X  part-of-speech information  X  3-tuples The target objects and their utilization roles are our newly added features. Henceforth, we call a set of clue patterns and part-of-speech information PT features. The following subsections describe the method for acquiring utiliza-tion.
 Acquisition of Utilization Roles. Torisawa made the following three assump-tions about the characteristics of utilization role p, v for a given noun n :1)An n marked by p often appears with v . 2) First-person pronouns such as  X  X atashi (I) X  often occupy the agent role of v . 3) The postposition  X  de  X  is a good can-didate of a postposition in a utilization role. Utilization roles were acquired by using the following formula reflecting these assumptions [9].
 V is a set of verbs, which can be a verb in possible utilization roles. As verbs in V , we used 6,485 verbs which appeared in the Web corpus with the verbal suffix  X  tai , X  which can be translated to  X  X ant. X  We also manually removed 20 verbs that can never take utilization roles such as  X  naru (become) X  or mean literally  X  X sing X  and  X  X njoying X  such as  X  tsukau (use) X  from V. A is a set of postpositions.
P ( n, p ,v ) is the co-occurrence probability between the verb v and n marked by the postposition p .Asfor P ( S | AP, v ), S denotes a set of first-person pronouns, and 17 pronouns were used. AP is a set of postpositions which can mark agent roles, and  X  ga  X  X nd X  ha  X  X ereused. P ( S | AP, v ) is the probability that the first-person pronouns occupy the agent role of v . Bias ( p ) denotes the bias concerning the p ostposition  X  de . X  If p is  X  de , X  the bias is 25, otherwise the bias is 1 by referring to Torisawa X  X  method [9]. 4.1 Preparation Construction of Training and Testing Data. For our experiment, ten ob-jects were selected from electric produc ts that had appeared 10,000 times or more in the web corpus [5] and also appear in Japanese WordNet 1.1. We con-structed training and testing data from the web corpus using the methods in Section 3.1. Passages w ere extracted using 20 5 as the window size  X  .Wechose two sets of 100 passages at random from each group of passages extracted by using the methods A and B, and three sets of 100 passages in decreasing order of frequency from the groups of passages extracted based on the C, D and E methods, and judged manually whether they contained know-how information or not. As utilization roles, we used top 25 pairs of a proposition and a verb au-tomatically produced by th e method described in Sect ion 3.2. In this research, we assume that the passage is judged to be correct if a given passage contains know-how information. Note that if a given passage contained only a fragment of know-how information, the passage was judged as incorrect. The sizes of the data are shown in Table 1.
 Generation of Clue Patterns. We constructed the development data in the same way as training and testing data by extracting candidates for know-how from the web corpus with the methods described in Section 3.1 and judging them manually whether they contained know-how information or not. The breakdown of the development data is shown in Table 2.

We manually generated 79 types of patterns by referring to the development data. Some examples of the patterns are shown in Table 3. The symbols  X  |  X ,  X + X  and  X  .  X   X  in column 2 represent a disjunction, a word boundary and any word sequences, respectively. Column 3 repre sents the targets that the patterns are applied to. S, L, R1, R2 and R3 represent a sentence, the leftmost bunsetsu in a sentence, the rightmost bunsetsu in a sentence, the rightmost two bunsetsus in a sentence and the rightmost three bunsetsus in a sentence, respectively.
In our experiments, the patterns were g enerated based on the development data constructed focusing on the object  X  X air dryer. X  However, we found that the patterns tended to depend not on an object but on the types of know-how information such as procedures and advices according to our preliminary investigation. 4.2 Settings In the experiment, the 3-tuples and PT fea tures (clue patterns and part-of-speech information) were used to train machine learning models. We used the following two types of 3-tuples: 3T auto As utilization roles, the top 25 pairs of a postposition and a verb pro-3T man As utilization roles, pairs of a postposition and a verb were manually Support Vector Machines were used as machine learning models and they were trained using LibSVM 6 . For the experiments, we prepared the following baseline method: baseline (conventional method) Identify whether a given passage contains In the next section, the effectiveness of using both an object and its utilization roles is shown by comparing models with and without the 3-tuples. 4.3 Experimental Results We split the data for each object in five and carried out 5-fold cross validation by using data composed of ten objects. The e xperimental results are shown in Table 4. In comparison with the model using only PT features (baseline), the models using both PT and 3T features significantly improved in both the precision and the recall. This indicates that lists of know-how can be efficiently acquired by focusing on an object and its utilization roles. In addition, the model using both PT and 3T auto features achieved good results although the rates were a little lower than ones using both PT and 3T man features.

In the above experiment, both the training and testing sets contained the same 10 objects. Thus, the results do not show that the proposed models would achieve good results for the data containing objects which are not contained in the training set since the patterns and the 3-tuples appearing in know-how information might depend on an object. Therefore, we carried out 10-fold cross validation by training the data containing nine objects out of ten and testing the data containing the rest (one object). The experimental results are shown in Table 5. The results show that both the precision and the recall were sig-nificantly improved by using the 3-tuples. This indicates that using an object and its utilization roles is useful even though the training set does not contain data for the target object. The differe nces between the proposed methods and the baseline method are statistically si gnificant according to Mcnemar X  X  test (p &lt; 0.01).
The 3-tuples feature of our proposed method is a template or a type of fea-tures while the patterns used as baseline features are surface strings or tokens. Therefore, the training data do not have to contain all of the 3-tuples appear-ing in the testing data. This indicates that the proposed method works without creating training data for all objects. 4.4 Discussion Error Analysis. In order to detect the causes o f errors, we investigated the results by 10-fold cross validation with the model that uses both PT and 3T man .
We investigated 222 passages acquired incorrectly and found following three main causes:  X  Passages containing only a fragment of know-how information  X  Passages containing utilization roles  X  Passages containing injunctions We investigated 523 passages that are know-how but could not be acquired. Objects besides the target object were used in 450 (86.0%) passages. That is to say, these know-how information might be acquired by targeting other objects. Furthermore, we expect that the recall w ill be more improved by simultaneously considering two or more objects and their utilization roles.
 Effect of an Object and Its Utilization Roles. In order to show the contri-bution of our 3-tuples compared with that of arbitrary 3-tuples to acquisition of know-how information, we carried out 10-fold cross validation using the following feature: 3T all The total number of the frequency of the 3-tuples o, p, v ,where o is a In addition, we carried out experiments by using only conventional methods in both extraction of know-how candidates and identification of know-how. That is, know-how candidates were extracted by using the method A through D in Section 3.1 (without the method E considering 3-tuples) and know-how infor-mation was identified by using the model based on PT features. Experimental results are shown in Table 6. The models attached with * in Table 6 are sta-tistically significant than the baseline method according to Mcnemar X  X  test (p &lt; 0.01). The model based on PT and 3T all features is not statistically signifi-cant than the baseline method. Moreov er, the models attached with * in Table 6 are statistically significant than the model based on PT and 3T all according to Mcnemar X  X  test (p &lt; 0.01). These results indicate that the 3-tuples should be selected for efficiently acquiring know-how information and one of the promising selection method is based on an object and its utilization roles. The last row in Table 6 shows the results obtained by using only conventional methods. The re-sults show that the 3-tuples play important roles in both extraction of know-how candidates and identification of know-how although we can not simply compare them since the size of the data are different.
To our knowledge, this study is the first trial to show that an object and its usage play an important role in acquiring know-how information. 4.5 Open-Domain Tests We performed experiments on data for diff erent domains. For the experiments, we selected eight objects (cu rtain, hunger, ladder, lighter, mirror perfume, scis-sors, stove) which are different types of ob jects from electric products. They were selected almost randomly except that fre quent nouns were preferred to others. The passages were automatically extracted in the same way as the construction of the training and testing data and classified whether they contained know-how information by the models trained using the training and testing data.
Table 7 shows the precisions for acquiring know-how information. The model using automatically acquired 3-tuples improved the precision and the recall (the number of lists of successfully acquired know-how information).

Thus, we expect that know-how information can be acquired by focusing on an object and how it is used without depending on domain. This paper presented a method for acquiring know-how information by focusing on an object and how it is used. First, w e extracted know-how candidates for each object. Then, by using both an object and its utilization roles, passages containing know-how information were efficiently acquired from them. Various lists of know-how information could be acquired by expanding the number of target objects although the y were restricted in our ex perimentsasafirsttrial.
In this paper, we used manually extracted patterns to compare our method with those in the previous works. We would like to acquire know-how information using automatically extracted patterns. In the future, we would like to consider (grammatical) objects of verbs for utilization roles since we expect that they are more useful information for identifying know-how information. For example, to  X  X onitor a temperature with thermometer X  is more important than to  X  X onitor something with thermometer X  in the second example in Figure 1. In addition, we would like to focus on multiple objects and how they are used since it is often the case that multiple objects are used in know-how. Know-how information would be more efficiently acquired by simultane ously considering two or more objects and their utilization roles.

In this study, we assume that know-how information could be mostly covered by the physical entities of WordNet. How ever, the coverage should be improved to get statistically valid data for obtaining utilization roles. We are planning to generalize nouns not found in WordNet.
