 Experts are important for providing reliable and authoritative in-formation and opinion, as well as for improving online reviews and services. While considerable previous research has focused on finding topical experts with broad appeal  X  e.g., top Java devel-opers, best lawyers in Texas  X  we tackle the problem of person-alized expert recommendation , to identify experts who have spe-cial personal appeal and importance to users. One of the key in-sights motivating our approach is to leverage the geo-spatial pref-erences of users and the variation of these preferences across differ-ent regions, topics, and social communities. Through a fine-grained GPS-tagged social media trace, we characterize these geo-spatial preferences for personalized experts, and integrate these prefer-ences into a matrix factorization-based personalized expert recom-mender. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed approach can improve the quality of recommendation by 24% in precision compared to several baselines. We also find that users X  geo-spatial preference of expertise and their underlying social com-munities can ameliorate the cold start problem by more than 20% in precision and recall.

Finding and recommending experts is a critical component for many important tasks. For example, the quality of movie recom-menders can be improved by biasing the underlying models toward the opinions of experts [1]. Making sense of mobile and social information streams such as the Facebook newsfeed and the Twit-ter stream can be improved by focusing on content contributed by experts. Along these lines, companies like Google and Yelp are actively soliciting expert reviewers to improve the coverage and re-liability of their services [8]. More generally and in contrast to sea-c  X  rch engines and question-answer systems, experts can provide on-going help for evolving and ill-specified needs, as well as personal-ized access to knowledge and experience that only experts possess.
Indeed, there has been considerable effort toward expert finding and recommendation, e.g., [2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 17, 20, 22]. These ef-forts have typically sought to identify topical experts with broad appeal, e.g., the top Java developer in an enterprise, the best lawyer in Texas. However, there is a research gap in our understanding of both (i) identifying personal experts , that is experts who are of significance and importance to me, but perhaps not viewed so more broadly. For example, I may be interested in the expert opin-ions of nearby local foodies, but less interested in the opinions of globally popular celebrity chefs; and (ii) how spatial preference for personally-valuable expertise varies across topics, across regions, and based on different underlying social communities. For exam-ple, technologists in Houston, TX may be more interested in the opinions of experts in nearby Austin and in more distant Silicon Valley, but less so in the opinions of experts from New York. Simi-larly, the reach of experts may vary by location, so that tech experts from Silicon Valley have a larger footprint than do experts from other regions.

Hence, in this paper, we are interested to study the problem of personalized expert recommendation by integrating the geo-spatial preferences of users and the variation of these preferences across different regions, topics, and social communities. These geo-spatial preferences are increasingly being revealed through the fine-grained geo-spatial footprints of Instagram, Foursquare, and Twitter, among other mobile location sharing platforms. Concretely, we oppor-tunistically leverage a collection of GPS-tagged Twitter users and their relationships in Twitter lists, a form of crowd-sourced knowl-edge whereby user A may label user B with a descriptor (like  X  X ech-nology X ). In isolation these lists allow a user to organize a per-sonal Twitter stream; in aggregate, the many labels applied to a target user in many lists can provide a crowdsourced expertise pro-file of the target user. Specifically, we propose and evaluate a matrix factorization-based personalized expert recommender that leverages three key factors:  X  Region-based locality , reflecting the variation in spatial prefer-ence from region to region. For example, Figure 1b and Fig-ure 1c shows that the preference of users for food experts varies greatly based on the location of the user (in essence, local users prefer local foodies). How can these regional differences be cap-tured and incorporated into a personalized expert recommender?  X  Topic-based locality , reflecting the variation in spatial preference across different topics. For example, Figure 1b and Figure 1e demonstrate that spatial preference is much less local for the topic technology than for food. How can this topical variation be integrated into a personalized expert recommender?
