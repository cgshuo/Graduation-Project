 Since its inception in 2000, privacy preserving data mining has gained increasing popularity in the data mining commu-nity. This line of research can be attributed to the growing concern of individuals and organizations for the violation of privacy in the mining of their data by the existing data mining technology. Consequently, a new body of research emerged, providing novel approaches for the mining of data, while prohibiting the leakage of sensitive information. My dissertation studies methodologies for the preservation of privacy in different contexts, data domains, and appli-cation scenarios. It consists of three parts. The first part investigates methodologies for the hiding of sensitive knowl-edge in the form of association rules, extracted from large transactional databases. Our research led to the proposal of a new direction of approaches that guarantee optimal hiding by introducing the least amount of side effects, while causing minimal distortion to the original data.
 The second part of the dissertation extends the applicability area of association rule hiding by applying similar techniques for the hiding of temporally and spatially annotated data. Our contribution is a privacy aware trajectory query engine, which enables untrusted users to query trajectory data that reside in a database. The engine guarantees that the answers that are returned to the end users do not violate the privacy of the users, whose movement is recorded in the database. The last part of the dissertation studies trajectory hiding in a real X  X ime environment where users, equipped with mobile devices, request services that depend on their location. The goal is to deliver methodologies that offer such services in a way that protects the identity of the requester. We consid-ered services that require multiple location transmissions to be offered and contributed methodologies that protect the identity of the requester from the time of request, until the service provision. Moreover, we contributed PLOT; the first toolbox for the offering of privacy in location based services. Association rule hiding aims at sanitizing a database in a way that (i) no sensitive association rule can be revealed when the sanitized database is mined at certain thresholds of confidence and support (or higher), (ii) all the nonsen-sitive rules can be successfully mined from the sanitized database, and (iii) no rule that was non-existent in the orig-inal database can be generated in its sanitized counterpart. aware trajectory tracking query engine [9,17] that provides on X  X ite, restricted access to in X  X ouse data to facilitate pri-vacy aware data publishing. The methodologies that had been proposed in the past were based solely on count and/or sum queries in statistical databases, since no other infor-mation was made available to the inquirer. On the other hand, the proposed query engine supports a large variety of queries, involving both trajectory and non X  X rajectory data. Furthermore, it provides the necessary mechanisms to secure the database against disclosure of confidential information, offering strict guarantees about what can be observed by untrusted third parties. Thus, it effectively blocks certain types of attacks that aim at utilizing the trajectories of the users in the database to reveal user identity.
 The last part of my dissertation proposes methodologies for the offering of privacy in services that depend on users X  loca-tion (known as Location-Based Services  X  LBSs) to be suc-cessfully provided. We assume users, each equipped with a mobile device, who request LBSs when on the move. A service request includes, among others, the location coor-dinates of the requester. Thus, with untrustworthy service providers, the identity of the requester can be easily found if the request reaches the service provider in its original form. To prohibit identification of the requester when he or she requests an LBS, the request has to be transformed to a pri-vacy aware counterpart. Among the different research direc-tions that have been investigated to tackle this problem, K  X  anonymity has received most of the attention, requiring that each service request that reaches the service provider points to at least K potential issuers (including the requester). My dissertation contributed along two principal lines of re-search within the K  X  X nonymity direction of privacy in LBSs: historical K  X  X nonymity , and trajectory K  X  X nonymity ap-proaches. To support historical K  X  X nonymity, we proposed two methodologies, which use the historical movement of the users in the system to automatically derive movement patterns that signify locations and times where the privacy of each user is under threat and use this information to adequately cover up the requesters of LBSs. The first ap-proach [18] assumes unconstrained user movement, while the second approach [4] assumes that the movement of the users is constrained to a series of allowable routes.
 Trajectory K  X  X nonymity approaches protect the privacy of the requesters of LBSs by using the current location of all users in the system as well as their future locations to cover up the requester until the service completion. To support trajectory K  X  X nonymity, we proposed a new line of research: personalized approaches to trajectory K  X  X nonymity , along with two novel approaches: a free terrain approach [5] that operates on the privacy model of [7], and a network aware approach [14] that operates on the privacy model of [12]. Both approaches consider an attacker who has knowledge of the user movement statistics for each user in the system and can use his/her knowledge to breach user privacy. Last, we proposed PLOT [13], the first open X  X nded toolbox that integrates centralized approaches for location privacy in location based services, in a common framework. PLOT offers the essential functionality for the implementation of novel location and trajectory privacy approaches, while serv-ing as a testbed for the comparison of different location pri-vacy algorithms. It supports both networkless and network
