 In prior work we addressed a major problem faced by media sites with popularity based recommender systems such as the top-10 list of most liked or most clicked posts. We showed that the hard cutoff used in these systems to generate the  X  X op N X  lists is prone to unduly penalizi ng good articles that may have just missed the cutoff. A solution to this was to generate recommendations probabilistically, which is an approach that has been shown to be robust against some manipulation techniques as well. The aim of this research is to introduce a class of probabilistic news recommender systems that incorporates widely practiced recommendation techniques as a special case. We establish our results in a special case of two articles using the urn models with feedback mechanism from probability theory. H.2.8 [ Database Applications ]: Data mining Algorithms, Top-N News recommender systems, probabilistic sampling, feedback recommender systems (NRS) on users. It is considered an important source of news articles for readers, articles which otherwise may get lost due to dynamic environment of news been noted that once a story appears in most popular list (widely used by media sites), there is an abrupt increase in its popularity and advertising than other stories [1, 7]. As it becomes visible to more readers the number of vote s grows at a faster rate.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  or  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  1 is susceptible to amplifying negligible differences in the initial counts of  X   X  X  X  and  X 1 X  X  X  X  article. Hence,  X 1 X  X  X  X   X  X  X  article which may have  X  X ust X  missed making the cutoff is often unduly penalized in the most-popular NRS. With some initial effort if a manipulator can get an article into a makes the article remain there with little additional effort. Recently there have been a lot of popular press articles that have highlighted exactly this problem, with manipulation in particular attracting a lot of attention. address the aforementioned issues [10]. Briefly, such systems generate recommendations by sampling probabilistically from the pool of articles that coul d be recommended. An article X  X  probability of being chosen in the recommended list is proportional to its current count/popularity. permits all articles to have some chance of being recommended. Such a mechanism does not penalize the marginal next articles that might have just missed a hard cutoff in a traditional Top-N list. This mechanism is also more robust against manipulation since it does not suffer as much from the self-reinforcing nature of the hard cutoff lists. NRS presented in [10]. For one, this approach may select some articles that are not as popular, thereby potentially sacrificing short-term clicks or readership. In an era where page views translate proportionally to advertising revenue this can be a concern in implementing this. Second, giving articles probabilistically sampling articles and does not provide the media client with any flexibility in implementing such a sampling scheme. problems of the prior probabilistic NRS through a class of probabilistic NRS with feedback and discuss various notable properties of it. Feedback models [4] are used in applications where the behavior of the system creates either positive or negative feedback that affects fu ture behavior of the system. For example, the typical  X  X op N X  recommender has a positive feedback mechanism for the articles in the list. introduced in this research can be considered as a unified model of selection techniques used for different news recommendation mechanisms based on the count of articles. For example, random selection, probabilistic selection in [10] and Top-N selection can be considered as special cases of a generalized probabilistic NRS introduced in the present research.

For example, Berger and Katherine [1] have addressed the issue of virality of most-emailed list at the New York Times; while Lerman and Ghosh [7] have studied the distribution of popularity for articles promoted to the front page of Digg-a popular social new aggregator. In somewhat different approach Prawesh and Padmanabhan [10], have discussed some specific characteristics of Top-N NRS using a thought experiment. with feedback exhibits similar be havior as discussed by Khanin and Khanin [6]. They have used a probabilistic model of  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  to study the pattern of neuron growth. In their context several  X  X eurites X  are known to exhibit a pattern of growth and contraction until one of them rapidly grows to become an  X  X xon X . The probability that a neurite grows in a time period is modeled to be proportional to its length in the previous period and also depends on the level of competition from other neurites. Our proofs have been adapted from the work of Khanin et al. [6]. been observed are: the technol ogy dominance of QWERTY and Microsoft X  X  operating systems m onopoly [4]. Metcalfe X  X  law-used to value a telecommunication network is also considered a special case of feedback mechan ism [11]. In business, positive feedback mechanisms can he lp a company reach monopoly status by starting with some initial advantage over competitors. Some types of positive externalities particularly contribute to this effect where the values of some systems increase super-linearly with the number of users [4]. the issue of exploration and exploitation of web-pages using controlled randomness into search result ranking methods. They show that modest amount of randomness leads to improved search results. list (CL) of articles. From CL, N articles are selected as  X  X ecommendations X . The selection of articles is based on probabilistic sampling without replacement. At any given time  X  (DL) is given by the exponent  X  .

But before we do so, it is worth observing how this selection mechanism can work in practice. implemented in [10]. With  X 1 X  we will have a system with positive feedback for the articles with higher counts. These are now going to have an even higher (i.e. more than proportional) of being in a recommended list, which can result in rapidly increasing counts. replacement) mechanism is similar to the current  X  X op N X  selection. At each stage the articl e with the highest count is most likely to be selected and the process will end up with a list identical to the Top N. feedback. It is also interesting here to consider what might happen when  X 0  X  . In such a case it is easy to see that all articles have the same probability of being recommended, essentially simulating a random recommender. site to dynamically manage a recommender list, alternating between exploration and exploitation as needed. Below we present formal theoretical results. proposed probabilistic NRS, we make following assumptions. 1. Two articles are available for recommendation (article-1 2.

At each time, upon arrival of a reader, an article is read and its count is increased by 1. The total count of articles in the system at time  X  is deterministic and it is given by  X   X   X  0  X   X  X   X   X  0  X   X  X  .

Similar, analysis can be extended for  X 0  X  X  X  X  X  . equivalent to an article being read randomly at each time step, irrespective of reader X  X  preference (i.e.  X  ).

Where P X lya urn mechanism corresponds to the probability function  X   X   X  X  X  X  and a Friedman urn corresponds to the probability function Let an urn initially contains  X   X   X 0 X  black balls and  X  balls.

This phenomenon is also understood as systems with positive feedback in economics, biol ogy and chemistry [6, 8]. articles (article-1 and article-2) compete until one article obtains non-negligible advantage in the count share; eventually leading to dominance of the NRS by a single article. The strength of feedback is modeled through the parameter  X  . In this case after a random moment of time an article will be always recommended. More precisely, with probability 1 there exists a time  X  that an article is recommended for all  X  X  X   X  .

So, in the pr esent setup the total reading probability (equation 3) is a mixture distribution of positive and negative feedback mechanism. the ratio of counts for articles tends to 1 as  X  X   X  .

The selection process of N articles generated through a processes defined by equation (1) is given by count (among those which ar e not yet selected for  X  X  ) the selection probability in DL will be 1, i.e.  X  X  max Hence, N probabilistic selections correspond to selection of N article with decreasing order of their counts. limitations of the  X  X ost popula r X  lists in recommendation systems. For example, in a recent article [2] in New York Times, it has been noted that, being 11th on a top 10 list on the recommendation system is a lot di fferent than being 10th on that list. Nick Bilton in [2] writes  X  Being at the top of these lists can generate substantial windfalls . The iTunes App Store, where apps like Angry Birds, Words With Friends and Pages have spent months at the top of the charts, help the app makers collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue, while those who cannot get that visibi lity founder in obscurity  X . NRS is leading us to less choice of news articles [2]. In several cases it has been also observed or suspected [2] that manipulators artificially inflat e the popularity of the items of top lists is the propagation of recommendations over social networks. Once an article (or app) makes such a list they are more likely to be picked up and propagated through social networks. content is a plus, when this is done so in a disproportional manner, at the expense of other (possibly equally good) articles or apps the mechanism starts creating phenomena that are clearly undesirable. The system in fluences readership or what that attract manipulators to potentially game the system. At the extreme such systems therefore are prone to a high degree of noise. solution to deal with these limitations of Top-N NRS. The absence of a hard cutoff eliminat es a key component of the self-reinforcing nature of such lists. However, it should be noted that in this new paradigm the term  X  X ost popular X  will not be appropriate in all cases. Instead it has to be replaced by more appropriate term such as, popular articles. selects unpopular articles that are not likely to be read. Our study of feedback functions in this paper makes a novel contribution in the field of NRS by proposing a recommendation technique that elegantly addresses this drawback by allowing the users to control the extent of the feedback in the system. amplification the model can be parameterized appropriately to select articles. At some point if the goal is to maximize short-term revenue the parameter can be adjusted to mimic the Top-N systems in behavior. The specific feedback function proposed in this paper for NRS therefore permits elegant combination of exploration and exploitation. Dy namically fine-tuning this and experimental results are aspects we are working on in current work. [1] Berger, J. and Milkman, K. L. 2011. What Makes Content [2] Bilton, N. 2012.
