 When visiting cities as tourists, most of the times people do not make very detailed plans and, when choosing where to go and what to seem they tend to select the area with the major number of interesting facilities. Therefor e, it would be useful to support the user choice with contextual information presentation, information clustering and comparative explanations of places of potential interest in a given area. In this paper we illustrate how MyMap, a mobile recommender sy stem in the Tourism domain, generates comparative descripti ons to support users in making decisions about what to see, among relevant objects of interest.

 Experimentation, Human Factors. Comparative descriptions, mob ile system, personalization. When visiting cities as tourists, most users intend to explore the area and find interesting things to see or information about places, objects, events, and so on. According to [2] most of the times they do not make very detailed plans  X  X  o that they can take advantage of changing circumstances X  and, when choosing where to go and what to see, they tend to  X  X ick up an area with more than one potential facility X . According to these findings, we developed MyMap, a mobile system that provides personalized recommendations of places of interest and delivers tailored information to tourists when and where they need them and according to their situational interests . Using a context-aware approach allows adapting and filtering items by exploiting the available knowledge about the situation of the user in order to produce more focused and useful recommendations [1,3,7,8,12,15]. To this aim MyMap generates personalized suggestions and descriptions about what to see, by using an XML annotation for map-related knowledge representation, a Mobile User Profiles (MUP) for managing contextualized user preferences, a media-independent content planner and a context-sensitive surface generator [4]. In this paper we present how we extended MyMap functionalities with the possibility of asking for comparative descriptions in order to support the user in choos ing what to see among the places of potential interest selected by the recommender system. MyMap, as other mobile system s in the tourism domain uses a map 1 for outlining places of interest in a town area. During its use, MyMap may provide sugges tions and information about places either proactively, according to context parameters such as the user position and time, or on-request when the user requests an explanation about either a single place or a category of places (i.e. eating facilities, monuments, etc.). In this context, for supporting users in making decisions about what to see among relevant places, it could be useful for the user to understand why they were recommended and also to have a comparative description of the suggested places rather than a set of individual ones. Comparative descriptions may help users in making decision about places to visit without losing time looking at the description of each place and avoiding the cognitive effort of keeping in mind and comparing all their relevant features (task that may result even more complex on a small device) [11]. To this extent, the knowledge sources of our system are exploited for clustering objects of interest be longing to the same category and for generating comparative descriptions according to a simple Natural Language Generation (NLG ) approach [13] based on the use of a discourse plan which outlines the  X  X ommonalities X  and the  X  X lignable X  and  X  X on alignabl e X  differences among described objects [10]. Commonalities are common attributes with the same values, Alignable_Differences are common attributes with different values and Non-Alignable Differences are peculiar attributes. In the comparative description only features that are appropriate to the user, according to the content of his/her profile, will be emphasized: commonalities are presented first, alignable differences second and non-alignable differences at the end. This strategy corresponds to what we c onsider a systematic description of concepts as mentioned in [6]. To achieve this aim MyMap executes the following steps: i) Selection of relevant content to be presented: this is done by matching user preferences, situation and context features with the metadata describing the region of the map where the user is located. Then, given the description of the situation S of a user u as a set of features ( S ( u )=[sf 1 , ...,sf n dynamic context features represented by the time t , user X  X  position MyMap may use its own map or GoogleMap. p and weather condition w, the system selects a set of relevant situational statements ( Select(MUP(u),S(u),t,p,w,all) ) in the MUP of the user u and regarding all categories of objects of interest in MyMap. The resulting statements are grouped according to their categories. For each situational statement in a category c j , the list of attributes against which perform the matching of the attributes a of interest is extracted and then the list of preferred items i produced by ordering them according to the number of matched user interests and to their confidence value. This rank is calculated according as follows: for each matching attribute ma of objects present in the area a around the user: confidence (ma(i k ,a))/nr(ma). Items whose value is above a certain threshold (0.5) ar e presented to the user on the map to be used for generating both individual and comparative descriptions. If none of them goes above the threshold, then the system presents all items and indi cates to the user that none of them is close to her preferences or interests. Information about the matched user preferences are explo ited to generate an explanation about why the items were recommended. In case the user explicitly asks for recommendations about a category cj , MyMap applies the same procedure by specifying it in the selection query: ii) Selection of the presentation plan that best suits the user request . In MyMap we use plans formalized in DPML [5] corresponding to the following communicative goals: i) Describe(single_object), as a consequence of the user click on the map spot, DescribeArea(list_of_objects) , allows describing objects of interest belonging to different categories and Compare(list_of_objects) allows describing by comparison a set of objects of interest of the same type. iii) Instantiation the generic plan with selected data. iv) Rendering the result as a web page (see Figure 2) structured as follow: a) on the left side the portion of the map of the town area where the user is located and the graphical indications about places of interest are displayed; b) on the right side a compact description of those places is provided; c) if more than one object of the same type is present in the list, the Compare link is displayed and the user may ask for a comparative description by clicking on it; d) on the bottom part, when the user selects one of the places in the list or asks for comparison, the correspondent messa ge is displayed. The user may also access information about an individual place directly clicking on the icons on the map. The user may always ask for the visualization of all the items present on the map without any personalization and may deactivate the comparison functionality in her setting page. Let X  X  consider the following scenario situation: Dora is travelling for business purposes. She is in Ba ri for the first time and she has only a few hours for visiting the town center. She is interested in visiting churches and she likes the Romanic period. She is downtown and she wants to know what is going on in that area; using her personal device she asks fo r information what to visit. Let X  X  now see how we generate comparative descriptions in the considered scenario. In such a scenario, according to situational statements (see Table 1 for an example) describing Dora X  X  preferences, MyMap will select Ro manic churches since she is highly interested in this style. In this case, the situ ation of the user ly X  X  and the set of relevant statements for the visiting category will be selected as SSt(Dora)=Select(MUP(Dora),S(Dora), 13.00,coord,sunny,visit). From this list, all attributes with their confidence will be extracted in order to perform the match against attributes of all relevant items. 
Table 1 . A fragment of MUP describing situational interests Then, all places (&lt;details&gt;) of category  X  X isiting X  being  X  X rt X  and of the type  X  X hurch X  matching these attributes and having coordinates that show that the place is relatively close to the user position (within 500 mt) will be selected in the metadata describing the map of that area. Starting from this list, their rank will be calculated and if it is above 0.5 that item will be outlined on the map. In the above-mentione d scenario the two churches, whose annotation is shown in Tabl e 2, will be selected. They will be then displayed on the map together with other places of possible interest for the user. If there are more than one item belonging to the same category c j for which the ranking value il higher than 0.5 the link  X  X ompare  X  will be generated, to allow comparative description of the relevant items in c j . Let X  X  suppose that the user asks for a comparis on. This request will trigger the selection of the correspondent plan recipe that will be then instantiated with the selected data. In Figure 1 we show a portion of plan, expressed in DPML and instantiated with relevant data, for comparing the two churches described in Table 2. The nodes of the tree have a unique name and are characterized by communicative goals. According to RST [9], the RR relation holding between children nodes depa rting from a parent node is indicated together with the role of the node in the relation (nucleus vs. satellite). Starting from the instantiated DPML plan, the appropriate templates are applied in order to generate the comparative description. This process is mainly driven by the type of the communicative goal and by the RR existing between subtrees of the plan. The surface generation of the message is obtained by using flexible templates [4,5]. For instance, the sentence:  X  X hey are both Romanic churches, of the sa me period (about 1100 a. C.) and they are both located in the area y ou are in now. X , in Figure 2, is DescribeCommonalities(church1,chur ch2) where the  X  X equence X  RR relates the inform about each of the common attributes in the list. Repetitions and redundancy in the message are avoided using the aggregation method [13]. The user may also access information about an individual place by directly clicking on the corresponding icon on the map. 
Figure 2 . An example of generated de scription (the message is As you can notice, the first sentence of the description ( X  X here are churches you could be interested in since they are Romanic, your favorite style. X ) explains why those churches have been recommended using the surface realization template typical of the  X  X otivation X  RR. Links to other descriptions are automatically generated when these objects are also annotated in the knowledge base of the system. This is possible by mentioning in the annotation of an attribute that a  X  X eference X  to it exists. For instance, in Figure 2, links are generated for  X  X attedra di Elia X  and  X  X xultet X . At this stage of the project we wanted to test whether, in case of more than one item of interest for each category, comparative descriptions were considered mo re helpful than individual ones. The experiment was set up as follo ws. We used a between subject design study with two groups of 15 Italian students, equally distributed in gender and being of age between 23 and 30, each of them coming from towns different from Bari. The first group, denoted as Group I ( Individual ), was provided with individual descriptions of objects of intere sts. The second group, denoted as Group C ( Comparative ), was provided with comparative descriptions. In order to perform both a subjective and an objective evaluation, we settled the system so as, according to the user interests, only 2 churches and 3 restaurants were suggested by the system. Before interacting with MyMap each user was asked, first of all, to state their preferences, through the MUP interface, about: eating places a nd artistic monuments. Then, each of them was placed in the center of the old town of Bari and was asked to use MyMap for deciding where to eat and which church to visit in a limited amount of time (max10 minutes). At the end of the experiment, each subject had to fill a questionnaire in which she had to write about he r decision (if one was taken). Moreover, subjects were asked to answer to a set of questions giving a score from 1 (bad/low) to 5 (good/high). Results (Table 3) show that the system was considered overall good in terms of performance in both cases. In terms of validity , individual descriptions were considered as good as the comparative ones. Subject X  X  perception of how much the description was useful in supporting their decision-making was higher for the group that received comparative descriptions. This result seems to be confirmed by the percentage of decisions taken by subjects in the two groups. Together with the subjective study we performed an objective one in which we evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness of the type of provided description by analysing in teraction logs. In particular we counted the number of clicks on provided links ( nrclick ), the number of times subjects went back ( nrback ) and the number of clicks on spots on the map ( nrmap ) in the two modalities. Table 4 provides an overview of the result of this analysis. In our opinion these data can be interpreted as fo llows: in order to make a decision the first group went back and forward between individual descriptions of single places of interest. This may indicate a higher cognitive effort for memorising and comparing mentally all the relevant information. However, the second group made more clicks on the map spots. We think that th is behaviour depended on the fact that once they read the comparative description subjects intended to look at the individual descriptions to get more details. This paper describes how a comparative description of places of interest presented in a tourist map might be used to help users in making decisions about where to go. Evaluation results show that integrating individual and compara tive descriptions may provide a valid help in making decisions according to the user interests and to the context situation. This finding seems to be supported also by the study described in [14] that indi cates that targeted information motivates the tourists to visit more accurately each sight. However, since in the experiment we compared a few items, we need to investigate how to deal with comparisons of a larger set of places of interest. We are aware that, when the number of items to compare is high (e.g. in huge cities as Paris), visualizing the comparative description may represent a problem , especially on a mobile device with a small monitor. In the future development of MyMap we plan to investigate on the impact of social and engaging aspects of tourism since tourism itself is a social experience that most people share with others [2]. To this aim, we are exploiting the capabilities of Android and the family of Google API. [1] Abowd, G. D., Atkeson, C. G ., Hong, J., Long, S., Kooper, [2] Brown, B. andChalmers, M. 2003.
