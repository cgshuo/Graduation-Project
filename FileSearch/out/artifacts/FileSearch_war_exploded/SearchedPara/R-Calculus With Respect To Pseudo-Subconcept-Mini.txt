In the Gentzen deduction system, a sequent  X   X   X  is reduced to atomic sequents  X  0  X   X  0 by using the rules of the right-hand side and of the left-hand side, where  X  0  X   X  0 is atomic if  X  otherwise,  X  | l,  X   X   X  |  X  , i.e., l is deleted from theory { l } X   X  .

To ensure the is a minimal change of theory { X  p,q } by { p } , such that { q } is consistent with { p } . Intuitively, we should have subconcepts and pseudo-subconcepts in description logics, corresponding to the subformulas and pseudo-subformulas, and based on which we will give an R -calculus T DL sound and complete with respect to -minimal change. Notice that here the minimal changes are not about the statements in description logics, but about the concepts. A concept set X is a -minimal change of a concept set Y by a concept set Z. Precisely, we define defines the logical language and the semantics of the simplified ALC ; section 3 defines the -minimal change and other related concepts; section 4 gives an R -calculus for a statement C ( a ) and proves that a set  X  of statements such that the set of the deduction rules is sound and complete with respect to the -minimal change; and the last section concludes the whole paper and discusses further works. Let L 1 be the logical language for the description logic ALC , which contains the following symbols: we use  X  , &amp; ,  X  , A , E to denote the corresponding connectives and quantifiers. where d is an old constant and c is a new one.

 Subformulas are a basic concept in traditional logics.

That is, logic ALC . And based on that the -minimal change has been defined and we gave an R -calculus T DL that is sound and complete with respect to the -minimal change.
 we consider an R -calculus which has a property as close to ` -minimal change as possible: ` -minimal change.
