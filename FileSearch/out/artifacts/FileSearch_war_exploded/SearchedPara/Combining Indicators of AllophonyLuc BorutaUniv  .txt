 Though the phonemic inventory of a language is typ-ically small, phonetic and phonological processes yield manifold variants 1 for each phoneme. Words too are affected by this variability, yielding different realizations for a given underlying form. Allophonic rules relate phonemes to their variants, expressing the contexts in which the latter occur. We are in-terested in describing procedures by which infants, learning their native allophonic grammar, could re-duce the variation and recover words. Combining in-sights from both computational and behavioral stud-ies, we endorse the hypothesis that infants are good distributional learners (Maye et al., 2002; Saffran et al., 1996) and that they may  X  X ootstrap X  into lan-guage tracking statistical regularities in the signal.
We seek to identify which features of infants X  in-put are most reliable for learning allophonic rules. A few indicators, based on distributional (Peperkamp et al., 2006) and lexical (Martin et al., submitted) in-formation, have been described and validated in sil-ico . 2 Yet, other aspects have barely been addressed, e.g. the question of whether or not these indicators capture different aspects of allophony and, if so, which combination scheme yields better results.
We present an extensive evaluation of individual indicators and, based on theoretical and empirical desiderata, we outline a more comprehensive frame-work to model the acquisition of allophonic rules. We build upon Peperkamp et al. X  X  framework: the task is to induce a two-class classifier deciding, for every possible pair of segments, whether or not they realize the same phoneme. Discrimination relies on indicators, i.e. linguistic properties which are corre-lated with allophony. As a model of language acqui-sition, this classifier is induced without supervision.
In line with previous studies, we assume that in-fants are able to segment the continuous stream of acoustic input into a sequence of discrete segments, and that they quantize each of these segments into one of a finite number of phonetic categories. Quan-tization is a necessary assumption for the framework to apply. However, the larger the set of phonetic cat-egories, the closer we get to recent  X  X ingle-stage X  ap-proaches (e.g. work by Dillon et al., in preparation) where phonological categories are acquired directly from raw infant-directed speech. 2.1 Distributional indicators Complementary distribution is a ubiquitous criterion for the discovery of phonemes. If two segments oc-cur in mutually exclusive contexts, the two may be realizations of the same phoneme.
 Bearing in mind that the signal may be noisy, Peperkamp et al. (2006) looked for segments in near-complementary distributions. Using the sym-metrised Kullback X  X eibler divergence (henceforth KL), they compared the probability distributions of how often the contexts of each segment occur. In a follow-up study, Le Calvez (2007) compared KL to other indicators, namely the Jensen X  X hannon diver-gence (JS) and the Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC). 3 2.2 Lexical indicators Adjacent segments can condition the realization of a word X  X  initial and final phonemes. If two words only differ by their initial or final segments, these segments may be realizations of the same phoneme. Instantiating the general concept of functional load (Hockett, 1955), lexical indicators gauge the degree of contrast in the lexicon between two segments. Using the simplest expression of functional load, Martin et al. (submitted) defined a Boolean-valued indicator, FL, satisfied by a single pair of minimally different words. As a result, FL is sensitive to noise. We define a finer-grained variant, FL*, which tallies the number of such pairs. Moreover, as words get longer, it becomes increasingly unlikely that such word pairs occur by chance. Thus, for any such pair, FL* is incremented by the length of those words.
We also propose an information-theoretic lexi-cal indicator, HFL, based on Hockett X  X  definition of functional load. HFL accounts for the fraction of information content, represented by the language X  X  word entropy, that is lost when the opposition be-tween two segments is neutralized. The  X  X roken typewriter X  function used for neutralization guaran-tees that values lie in [0 , 1] (Coolen et al., 2005). In the absence of phonetic transcriptions of infant-directed speech, and as the number of allophones in-fants must learn is unknown (if assessable at all), we use Boruta et al. X  X  (submitted) corpora. They created a range of possible inputs, applying artificial allo-phonic grammars 4 of different sizes (Boruta, 2011) to the now-standard CHILDES  X  X rent/Ratner X  cor-pus of English (Brent and Cartwright, 1996). We quantify the amount of variation in a corpus by its allophonic complexity, i.e. the ratio of the number of phones to the number of phonemes in the language.
Lexical indicators require an ancillary procedure yielding a lexicon. Martin et al. approximated a lex-icon by a list of frequent n -grams. Here, the lexicon is induced from the output of an explicit word seg-mentation model, viz. Venkataraman X  X  incremental (2001) model, using the unsegmented phonetic cor-pora as the input. Though, obviously, infants can not access it, we use the lexicon derived from the CHILDES orthographic transcripts for reference. As the aforementioned indicators have been evalu-ated using various languages, allophonic grammars and measures, we present a unified evaluation, con-ducted using Sing et al. X  X  (2005) ROCR package. 4.1 Evaluation Non-Boolean indicators require a threshold at and above which pairs are classified as allophonic. We evaluate indicators across all possible discrimination thresholds, reporting the area under the ROC curve (henceforth AUC). Equivalent to Martin et al. X  X   X  , values lie in [0 , 1] and are equal to the probability that a randomly drawn allophonic pair will score higher than a randomly drawn non-allophonic pair; .5 thus indicates random prediction.

Moreover, we evaluate indicators X  misclassifica-tions at the discrimination threshold maximizing Matthews X  (1975) correlation coefficient: let  X  ,  X  ,  X  and  X  be, respectively, the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives and true negatives, MCC = (  X  X   X   X  X  ) / p (  X  +  X  )(  X  +  X  )(  X  +  X  )(  X  +  X  ) . Values of 1 , 0 and  X  1 indicate perfect, random and inverse prediction, respectively. This coefficient is more appropriate than the accuracy or the F-measure when, as here, the true classes have very differ-ent sizes. 5 Using this optimal, MCC-maximizing threshold, we report the maximal MCC and, as per-centages, the accuracy (Acc), the false positive rate (FPR) and the false negative rate (FNR). 4.2 Results and discussion Indicators X  AUC corroborate previous results for distributional indicators: they perform almost iden-tically and do not accommodate high allophonic complexities at which they perform below chance (Figure 1.a) because, as suggested by Martin et al., every segment has an extremely narrow distri-bution and complementary distribution is the rule rather than the exception. By contrast, all three lexical indicators are much more robust even if, as predicted, FL X  X  coarseness impedes its discriminant power (Figure 1.b). 6 The reason why FL* outper-forms HFL may be due to the very definition of HFL X  X  broken typewriter function: as the segments, e.g. { x,y } , are collapsed into a single symbol, the indicator captures not only minimal alternations like wx  X  wy , but also word pairs such as xy  X  yx .
AUC curves suggest that, for each type, indi-cators converge at medium allophonic complexity. Thus, misclassification scores are reported in Table 1 only at low (2 allophones/phoneme) and medium (9) complexities. Previous observations are confirmed by MCC and accuracy values: though all indicators are positively correlated with the underlying allo-phonic relation, correlation is stronger for lexical in-dicators. Surprisingly, zero FPR values are observed for some lexical indicators, meaning that they make no false alarms and, as a consequence, that all errors are caused by missed allophonic pairs. None of the indicators we benchmarked in the previ-ous section makes a perfect discrimination between allophonic and non-allophonic pairs of segments. Yet, if some segment pairs are misclassified by one but not all (types of) indicators, a suitable combi-nation should outperform individual indicators. In other words, combining indicators may yield better results only if, individually, indicators capture dif-ferent subsets of the underlying allophonic relation. 5.1 Evaluation To get a straightforward estimation of redundancy, we compute the Jaccard index between each indica-tor X  X  set of misclassified pairs: let D and L be sets containing, respectively, a distributional and a lexi-cal indicator X  X  errors, J ( D,L ) = | D  X  L | / | D  X  L | . Values lie in [0 , 1] and the lower the index, the more promising the combination. To distinguish false pos-itives from false negatives, we compute two Jaccard indices for each possible combination. 5.2 Results and discussion Jaccard indices, reported in Table 2, emphasize the distinction between false positives and false nega-tives. False negatives have rather high indices: most allophonic pairs that are not captured by distribu-tional indicators are not captured either by lexical indicators, and vice versa . By contrast, there is little or no redundancy in false positives, even at medium allophonic complexity: though random pairs can be incorrectly classified as allophonic, the error is un-likely to recur across all types of indicators.
It is also worth noting that though JS performs slightly better than KL and BC, the exact nature of the distributional indicator seems to have little influ-ence on the performance of the combination. As distributional and lexical indicators are not com-pletely redundant, combining them is a natural ex-tension. However, not all conceivable combination schemes are appropriate for our task. We present our choices in terms of Marr X  X  (1982) levels of analysis.
At the computational level, a combination scheme can be either disjunctive or conjunctive, i.e. each in-dicator can be either sufficient or (only) necessary. Aforementioned indicators were designed as neces-sary but not sufficient correlates of phonemehood. For instance, while a phoneme X  X  allophones have complementary distributions, not all segments that have complementary distributions are allophones of a single phoneme. Therefore, we favor a conjunctive scheme, 7 even if this conflicts with abovementioned results: most errors are due to missed allophonic pairs but a conjunctive scheme, where every indi-cator must be satisfied, is likely to increase misses.
At the algorithmic level, a combination scheme can be either logical or numerical. A logical scheme uses a logical connective to join indicators X  Boolean decisions, typically by conjunction according to our previous decision. By contrast, a numerical scheme tries to approximate interactions between indicators X  values, merging them using any monotone increas-ing function; discrimination then relies on a single threshold. In practical terms, we use multiplication as a numerical counterpart of conjunction. 6.1 Evaluation Setting aside the following minor adjustments, we use the same protocol as for individual indicators.
Logical combinations require one discrimination threshold per combined indicator. As it facilitates comparison with previous results, we report perfor-mance at the thresholds maximizing the MCC of individual indicators (rather than at the thresholds maximizing the combined MCC) .

Numerical combinations are sensitive to differ-ences in indicators X  magnitudes. Equal contribution of all indicators may or may not be a desirable prop-erty, but in the absence of a priori knowledge of indicators X  relative weights, each indicator X  X  values were standardized so that they lie in [0 , 1] , shifting the minimum to zero and rescaling by the range. 6.2 Results and discussion It is worth noting that, while the performance of combined indicators is still good (Table 3), it is less satisfactory than that of the best individual in-dicators. Moreover, even if misclassification scores show that conjoined and multiplied indicators per-form similarly, disparities emerge at medium allo-phonic complexity: while multiplication yields bet-ter MCC and FNR, conjunction yields better accu-racy and FPR. In that regard, observing FPR values of zero is quite satisfactory from the point of view of language acquisition, as processing two segments as realizations of a single phoneme (while they are not) may lead to the confusion of true minimal pairs of words. Indeed, at a higher level, learning allo-phonic rules allows the infant to reduce the size of its emerging lexicon, factoring out allophonic real-izations for each underlying word form.

Furthermore, AUC curves for the multiplicative scheme (Figure 2), 8 most notably FL X  X , suggest that distributional indicators X  contribution to the combi-nations appears to be rather negative, except at very low allophonic complexities. One explanation (yet to be tested experimentally) would be that they come into play later in the learning process, once part of allophony has been reduced using other indicators. We presented an evaluation of distributional and lex-ical indicators of allophony. Although they all per-form well at low allophonic complexities, misclas-sifications increase, more or less seriously, when the average number of allophones per phoneme in-creases. We also presented a first evaluation of the combination of indicators, and found no significant difference between the two combination schemes we defined. Unfortunately, none of the combinations we tested outperforms individual indicators.
For comparability with previous studies, we only considered combination schemes requiring no mod-ification in the definition of the task; however, learning allophonic pairs becomes unnatural when phonemes can have more than two realizations. Embedding each indicator X  X  segment-to-segment (dis)similarities in a multidimensional space, for ex-ample, would enable the use of clustering techniques where minimally distant points would be analyzed as allophones of a single phoneme.

Thus far, segments have been nothing but abstract symbols and, for example, the task at hand is as hard for [a]  X  [a not only do allophones of a given phoneme tend to be acoustically similar, but acoustic differences may be more salient and/or available earlier to the infant than complementary distributions or minimally dif-fering words. Therefore, the main extension towards a comprehensive model of the acquisition of allo-phonic rules would be to include acoustic indicators.
