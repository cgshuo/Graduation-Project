Suppose then the size-frequency function f ( j ) has the form where C &gt; 0 is dependent on t , j P 1 and of this system (see Egghe (2005a, 2005b) ).
 where sources are ranked in decreasing order of their number of items): B &gt;0, b &gt; 0 and r e ]0, T ], T being the total number of sources.
The relation between a and b is: where also formula (6) is proved.

The basis of the proof of the equivalence of (3) and (5) is the relation and not related to Lotkaian informetrics. It will be used in this paper as well. with (3) (as mentioned above) and where we showed that b  X  (first convex, then concave) or a reverse S-shape (first concave, then convex). ing by T the total number of sources and by A the total number of items we have  X  X  X oken X  X ).

The paper closes with some conclusions and open problems.
Similar to the Naranan formalism we suppose the following assertions
Note that the above also includes linear growth in case a rank-frequency function g ( r ).

Noting that D &lt;0, g 00  X  r  X  has the sign of If we denote for simplicity, we see that g 00 ( r ) has the sign of
Hence g ( r ) has no inflection point if a 1 = a 2 :if0&lt; a since r 6 c 1 t a 1 ) (since g ( r ) is not defined on negative values) and has no inflection if and only if (20) and (21) prove (14) and (15) since t &gt;0.

Let us now assume (15) . Suppose that we have the first inequality in (15) .If a of (19) is &gt; 0. Hence g ( r ) is convex. If a 2 &lt; a
