Let D be defined as y = ( Y tasks. 2.1 The Linear Case Let the class of hypotheses be defined as M ( w )  X  R , can be defined as bution. Maximizing the expected ( average ) margin follows from solving counterpart becomes which can be written as a constrained convex problem as min 1 . The Lagrangian with multiplier  X   X  0 becomes L ( w,  X  ) =  X  1 where w substituting (5) in the constraint w T w = 1 , or  X  = 1 remain valid as n  X  X  X  , resulting in the following theorem.

Specifically, if the function K is positive definite.

The empirical Rademacher complexity is then defined [8, 1] a s where the expectation is taken over the choice of the binary v ector  X  = (  X  optimal estimate explicitly.
 Lemma 1 (Trace bound for the Empirical Rademacher Complexit y for H ) Let  X   X  R n  X  n be defined as  X  is fixed, it is immediately seen that the max over the choice of the Rademacher variables gives
