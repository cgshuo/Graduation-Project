 In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient approach, a localized routing tree (LRT) coupled with a route redi-rection (RR) strategy, to support various types of queries. LRTs take care of the sensors near the sink and reduce the energy consumption of these sensors, and RR reduces the energy cost of data receptions. Compared to the existing approaches, simulation studies show that LRT together with RR has significant improvement on the query capacity.
With the advance of computing and communication tech-nologies, sensor networks play an important role in many applications, such as environment monitoring and military event detection. In these applications, a type of query, called zone-based query, which obtains answer from readings of sen-sors in a sub-area of a network, needs to be supported. An example of zone-based query is shown as follows:
This query is used to collect the highest temperature from sensors within a rectangular area (zone) every 50 seconds for 60 minutes. From the viewpoint of data collection, the example zone-based query is an aggregative query, which can be further classified into holistic queries and non-holistic queries. Median , Distinct Count , and Histogram are holistic queries. Max , Min , and Avg of sensor readings are examples of non-holistic queries. { jlian, knaik } @swen.uwaterloo.ca work performed when the author was affiliated with Uni-versity of Waterloo, leichen@cs.ust.hk { tozsu,gbaagnew } @uwaterloo.ca
We propose a new approach for routing tree construction, called Localized Routing Tree (LRT), to address the issues that sensors near the sink (especially Region-1) deplete their energy faster and the problems of RTs rooted at the sink. In our approache, there are four steps to accomplish a query task: query distribution , LRT construction , data collection , and data forwarding . Query distribution is responsible for disseminating queries to query-related sensors, which is pre-formed by using the existing flooding techniques. In the LRT construction phase, a localized routing tree is built for collecting data. In the data collection step, the sensed data are collected by the local roots of the constructed LRTs. Fi-nally, these local roots forward the aggregated or raw data to the sink in the data forwarding step. We use query capacity , rather than average total energy cost, as performance mea-sure of query plans of a sensor network. The query capacity is defined as the total number of complete query responses received by the sink when the lifetime of the network is over, where the lifetime of a network is defined as the time from initial start of the network to the moment when a certain percent of sensors is disconnected from the sink.

For a given zone-based query, sensors can be classified into three types: sensing , forwarding , and normal sensors. A sensing sensor is a sensor within the query zone with sensing tasks and a forwarding sensor routes sensed data to the sink, but it does not perform any sensing task. A normal sensor is a sensor which is not of the above two types. We construct LRTs by using the idea of location-based routing. Each sensing sensor is assumed to know the sink location, the area of the query zone, and the locations and IDs of its neighbors. There are three steps for LRT construction. (1) Computing the root reference points.

Initially, all sensing sensors compute the coordinate of a unique geographical point, called root reference point . The root reference point is selected as the intersected point be-tween one edge of the query zone and the line segment con-necting the sink and the center of the zone ( R 1 in Figure 2).
Figure 2: Constructed RT and root reference point (2) Selecting local roots
Sensing sensors use their locally maintained locations of their neighbors to determine if they are local roots . For each sensing sensor s , if s has the shortest distance to the root reference point among all neighbors of s , then s is selected as a local root. If a sensing sensor is not a local root, it is an internal node . (3) Selecting a parent node.

To construct a LRT, each internal node s selects a neigh-bor sensing sensor, which has the shortest distance to the root reference point among all the neighbors of s , as s  X  X  parent node.

Compared to the existing approaches, which build RTs rooted at the sink, LRTs are built within a query zone and are rooted at sensors within the query zone. As illustrated in Figure 3(a), for a non-holistic query, an LRT is built with a
