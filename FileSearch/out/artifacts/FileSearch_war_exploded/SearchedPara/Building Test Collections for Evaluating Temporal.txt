 Research on temporal aspects of information retrieval has recently gained considerable interest within the Information Retrieval (IR) community. This paper describes our efforts for building test collections for the purpose of fostering tem-poral IR research. In particular, we overview the test col-lections created at the two recent editions of Temporal In-formation Access (Temporalia) task organized at NTCIR-11 and NTCIR-12, report on selected results and discuss several observations we made during the task design and implemen-tation. Finally, we outline further directions for constructing test collections suitable for temporal IR.

Topical document relevance has traditionally been the key concern in the development and evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Recently, however, IR community has been interested in exploring other dimensions which un-derlie effective search processes such as the novelty, diversity, coverage, and/or readability. Timeliness is one such quality aspect of documents which, to a significant degree, deter-mines user satisfaction, at least, for the subset of queries whose underlying search intents contain strong temporal component (e.g., Pisa weather , Olympics 2020 ). In consequence, Temporal IR [1, 7] has started to emerge as one challenge of information retrieval in which time and tempo-rality play crucial roles.

Time-related aspects can be actually bound to many com-ponents in the architecture of a search engine system and to many steps of a retrieval process. For example, temporal-ity may be already estimated on the level of input queries (query issue time and temporal intent class). Documents can be associated with different types of time (e.g., publica-tion time, content focus time or content modification time) allowing construction of temporally-aware search indexes. Finally, retrieval mechanisms can output results according to the match between the temporal aspects of query intents and the estimated time scopes of documents [3].

While some prior attempts tried to survey the growing field of Temporal IR [1, 7] or to investigate the actual user needs and tactics while searching for information of tempo-ral character [4], the community lacks common evaluation grounds and standardized test beds for effective comparison and evaluation of search technologies.

Temporal Information Access ( Temporalia ) 1 tasks hosted at NTCIR-11 [5] and NTCIR-12 [6] aimed to fill in this gap. Both Temporalia-1 and Temporalia-2 consisted of two sub-tasks focusing on two crucial components necessary for de-signing an effective time-aware IR process. Temporal Query Intent Categorization ( TQIC ) in Temporalia-1 and Tempo-ral Intent Disambiguation ( TID ) in Temporalia-2 dealt with the problem of recognizing temporal class of search queries. On the other hand, Temporal Information Retrieval ( TIR ) and Temporally Diversified Retrieval ( TDR ) in Temporalia-1 and Temporalia-2, respectively, concentrated on evaluating document retrieval for information needs with underlying temporal aspect. While English was our primary focus, the second edition of Temporalia extended also the evaluation to Chinese. Tab. 1 shows the overall participation in both editions of the task, while Tab. 2 summarizes the resulting test collections.

Although many tasks at TREC, CLEF or NTCIR have been devoted to query analysis and document retrieval, only a few of them particularly focused on temporal aspects in search. Furthermore, temporal notions in other tasks were typically limited to the timeliness and recency requirements put on extracted information. TempSum and KBA are the most relevant ones.

TREC X  X  Temporal Summarization task 2 ( TempSum ) is composed of two subtasks: Sequential Update Summariza-tion and Value Tracking . Sequential Update Summariza-tion asks to find timely, sentence-level, reliable, relevant and non-redundant updates about developing events, while Value Tracking requires tracking values of event-related at-tributes (e.g., fatalities count) being of high importance to the event. Both subtasks have clear temporal character since the updates have to be not only relevant but also timely. Al-though, we also test ranking methods for the  X  X ecency X  class of search needs in our tasks, we do not limit the scope to the information needs about recent or ongoing events, or to a particular type of attribute-like information. Hence, any temporal query category may become an input, and the re-sults are output as lists of ranked documents rather than information pieces.

One of its subtasks, Streaming Slot Filling , tracks the at-tributes and relations of a selected entity over time. Simi-larly to TempSum, the temporal information need is in the form of a recency requirement. In addition, only documents related to a particular entity such as a person or organization are deemed relevant. First we discuss time categorization used in Temporalia. Several categorizations of time are possible such as ones according to calendar, frequency, periodicity, distance, etc. However, the most common and the most natural distinc-tion is the division of timeline into the past, present and fu-ture from the viewpoint of a speaker or information searcher. Therefore, we have constructed our task around this natural Table 4: Example topic for TDR subtask (Dry Run).
 time distinction assuming the query issuing time as a center (i.e., point  X  X ow X ). In addition, we provided an atemporal class for queries without any obvious time focus. The four classes are defined below. We also show example queries with their per-class probability distributions in Tab. 3.
Past : class of queries about past entities or events. Con-tent relevant to past-related queries is not expected to change significantly over time.

Recency : class of queries about present or recent enti-ties or events. Relevant content for queries belonging to the Recency class generally changes frequently and quickly hence the search results are expected to contain timely and up-to-date documents.

Future : class of queries about predicted, scheduled or expected events. Search results should contain documents with future-related information when compared to the query issuing time.

Atemporal : class characterizing queries without any clear temporal intent. Search results returned for atemporal queries are not expected to be related to time, neither, their con-tent should change much over time. Navigational queries are considered to be atemporal.
In both the task editions we have approached the prob-lem of detecting temporal classes of intent underlying search queries. According to the well-known study conducted in 2008 on the AOL query dataset [10], about 1.5% of queries have been found to contain explicit temporal expressions (e.g., Tokyo Olympics 1964 , popular songs 2000s ). Although this rate may seem small at first, it amounts to quite a large number of searches, and it does not cover queries which lack clear temporal expressions which contain strong implicit temporal component (e.g., Berlin Wall , economic forecast or Tokyo Olympics ).

Given the set of query strings associated with their sub-mitting times, participants had to develop systems to de-termine either the dominant temporal class (past, recency, future and atemporal) of each of the queries (TQIC subtask in Temporalia-1) or their per-class distribution (TID subtask in Temporalia-2). Queries for both the dry and formal runs were created based on seed set of temporal expressions and were then collected from search engine query logs or search suggestions given by major search engines. We have then administered crowdsourcing tasks for determining the dis-tribution of queries across the temporal classes. Each query received 20 judgments.

The performance of submitted runs in TQIC was mea-sured by the average rate of queries with correct tempo-ral classes and, in TID, by (i) the averaged per-class abso-lute loss as well as (ii) by the cosine similarity between the ground truth temporal class distribution and the distribu-tion estimated by the participating systems.
 In Fig.1 we show the system performance in Temporalia-1 TQIC subtask. Temporalia-2 TID results will be reported at NTCiR-12 Conference, June 2016, Tokyo, Japan.
The second problem relates to ranking results for queries containing temporal requirement. First, Temporal Informa-tion Retrieval (TIR) at Temporalia-1 asked participants to retrieve a set of documents for a search topic that incor-porates time factor. In addition to a standard search topic data (i.e., title, description, and sub topics), TIR search topic contained the query submitting date information to indicate the relationship between the query and searcher.
Temporally Diversified Retrieval (TDR) extended TIR by requiring participants to separately retrieve ranked lists of documents relevant to each of four temporal intent classes for a given topic. Participants were also asked to return a set of documents that is temporally diversified for the same topic. TDR participants received a set of topic descriptions, query issuing time, and indicative search questions for each of temporal classes (Past, Recency, Future, and Atempo-ral). The objective of the indicative search questions was to demonstrate one possible subtopic under a particular tem-poral class. In Tab. 4 we show an example topic with its subtopics.

For the evaluation, the standard Cranfield methodology was used. In particular, a pool of potentially relevant docu-ments was created based on the top-ranked documents from participants X  submitted runs. Then each document in the pool was assessed through online crowdsourcing (3 judg-ments per document for each class), and its relevance grade was judged. Given a ranked list generated for a specific temporal subtopic, the system performance was evaluated using Precision, Q-measure and nDCG metric. For a diver-sified ranked list generated to satisfy all possible temporal classes, the performance was evaluated using  X  -nDCG and D#-nDCG.

In Fig.2 we show the system performance in Temporalia-1 X  X  TIR subtask. Temporalia-2 X  X  TDR results will be re-ported at NTCIR-12 Conference.
Both, Temporalia-1 and Temporalia-2 used the same doc-ument corpus for English called LivingKnowledge News and Blogs Annotated Sub-collection constructed by the Living-Knowledge project and distributed by the Internet Memory Foundation [9]. This collection of approximately 20GB size spans the time period from May 2011 to March 2013 and contains around 3.8M documents from about 1,500 different blogs and news sources. We chose this collection since it has a relatively long temporal span of documents. To facilitate information extraction, we have indicated sentence bound-aries as well as mentions of named entities, and we have also disambiguated detected temporal expressions.

Temporalia-2 has also introduced Chinese language. So-gouCA 3 and SogouT 4 document collections were used for the dry run and formal run, respectively. Three kinds of an-notations were provided: sentence splitting, named entities, and time annotations.
In this section we discuss several observations obtained during the task design and we outline some future directions:
Challenges with Recency and Future classes : Re-cency and Future classes seem to be the most challenging when it comes to recognizing temporal intent. The mean classification accuracy for these classes were 0.565 and 0.678, respectively, compared to 0.687 and 0.733 for the Atemporal and Past classes, respectively. This can be also seen in Fig. 3, which shows the confusion matrix for TQIC subtask.
Balancing queries over temporal classes : When cre-ating test sets for TID subtask we faced the problem with
Figure 4: Overview of techniques used in TQIC. constructing a query set that would be appropriately bal-anced over query classes. For example, Atemporal class was ubiquitous for each query making it difficult to find many queries without substantial probability score in the Atem-poral class. Relatedly, the combinations in which relatively high rate was observed in the Future as well as in the Past class were quite rare. All these issues made the construction of symmetrical test set collections a difficult challenge.
Sources of temporal signals : Participants used variety of external sources and tools for capturing temporal signals. For a rough overview, we show in Fig. 4 the types of tempo-ral signals and techniques used by the participating teams in the TQIC subtask.

Relation to search result diversification tasks : IMine [8] and Intent [12] tasks focus on various aspects of search re-sult diversification in IR. For example, Query Understanding ( QU ) and Vertical Incorporating ( VI ) subtasks in IMine-2 require to identify the subtopics of a query or diversify or-ganic results respectively. Temporal intent detection and temporal diversification of results could be then regarded as attempts at enforcing higher level diversification, i.e., diver-sification not on the level of subtopics but, on the level of temporal classes, each of which typically covers several pos-sible subtopics that share the same temporal orientation.
Task participation : As indicated in Tab. 1, the num-ber of participating teams in Temporalia-2 increased by 40% from Temporalia-1. This demonstrates the need for and benefits of Temporalia X  X  test collections. As for the sub-task breakdown, tasks related to estimating temporal query classes were more popular than ones for retrieving docu-ments. Besides the presumed difficulty of indexing the doc-ument collection, the need to cope with large data sizes as well as with the content of varying subtopics, the other rea-sons for this preference could come from the problems with estimating temporality of large text chunks in contrast to short query strings that can be rather easily manipulated. We also note that Chinese language TDR failed to attract any participation in contrast to Chinese language TID. This may suggest that the additional difficulty of processing large amounts of ideograms in documents might have outweighed the benefits of solving the task in a language less commonly researched within the IR community.

Future of Temporal IR evaluation : Estimating fo-cus time of documents [1, 3], which is the time to which documents refer to, could be one possible subtask in the fu-ture. Another challenge is estimating document creation time. In this context, we note that SemEval2015 intro-duced Diachronic Text Evaluation task [11] which required to identify time interval when a given piece of news text (typically spanning between tens to a couple of hundred of words) was published on the time scale of 1700 and 2010.
We think that the combination of the document creation and focus time coupled with the estimated query X  X  tempo-rality and its issuing date should offer sufficient for judging temporal correspondence of documents to the query. Fi-nally, future challenges could be designed to testing tempo-ral query suggestion or retrieval mechanisms over long term document archives.
In this paper we have reported the results of our recent ef-forts towards building test collections for fostering Temporal IR and related applications in the context of Temporalia-1 and Temporalia-2 tasks at NTCIR-11/12. Both tasks fo-cused on two important objectives. The first one is to test methods for recognizing temporal aspects behind query in-tent. The second objective is to facilitate comparison of document ranking methods according to temporal classes of queries. Unlike other test collections, Temporalia X  X  test col-lections are designed to let researchers compare performance of their systems across major temporal classes.
