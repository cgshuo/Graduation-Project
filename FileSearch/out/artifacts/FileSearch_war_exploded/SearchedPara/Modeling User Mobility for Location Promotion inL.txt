 With the explosion of smartphones and social network ser-vices, location-based social networks (LBSNs) are increas -ingly seen as tools for businesses (e.g., restaurants, hotels) to promote their products and services. In this paper, we investigate the key techniques that can help businesses pro -mote their locations by advertising wisely through the un-derlying LBSNs. In order to maximize the benefit of loca-tion promotion, we formalize it as an influence maximiza-tion problem in an LBSN, i.e., given a target location and an LBSN, which a set of k users (called seeds) should be ad-vertised initially such that they can successfully propaga te and attract most other users to visit the target location. Existing studies have proposed di ff erent ways to calculate the information propagation probability, that is how likel y ausermayinfluenceanother,inthesettingsofstaticsocial network. However, it is more challenging to derive the prop-agation probability in an LBSN since it is heavily a ff ected by the target location and the user mobility, both of which are dynamic and query dependent. This paper proposes two user mobility models, namely Gaussian-based and distance-based mobility models, to capture the check-in behavior of individual LBSN user, based on which location-aware prop-agation probabilities can be derived respectively. Extens ive experiments based on two real LBSN datasets have demon-strated the superior e ff ectiveness of our proposals than exist-ing static models of propagation probabilities to truly refl ect the information propagation in LBSNs.

 c  X  Influence maximization; propagation probability; check-i n behavior; location-based social network
Due to the success of viral marketing, more and more advertisements appear in social networks. The key to the success of viral marketing is the influence among social con-nections. Users are more likely to accept the advertisement s from their friends in social networks than from media di-rectly. By observing this phenomenon, prior works have elaborated on the influence maximization problem in social networks. In general, a social network is modeled as a graph G =( U, E ), where U is the set of users, E refers to the social connections among users, and the weight of edges infers the influence degree between users. Given a graph, the influence maximization problem is to select a set of users as seeds with the purpose of maximizing the number of influenced users (i.e., influence spreads) in a social network.

With the popularity of smart phones and location-based social networks (LBSNs), users are able to check-in at some locations and share their check-in records with their frien ds. In view of the social influences of friends, recently, many POIs (e.g., restaurants, stores) have explored check-in sh ar-ing to attract users to stay or visit. We mention in pass-ing that the prior work in [16] formulated a location-aware influence maximization problem in which, given a query re-gion and the location of users, a set of seed users is deter-mined with the purpose of maximizing influence spreads in the query range. In reality, locations in social media are referred to as POIs which could be restaurants, hotels or theme parks. From the perspective of POIs, each would like to attract users to visit, and via the check-in records of use rs, more users (e.g., friends of check-in users) will be influenced and then visit this POI. Thus, we formulate this problem as a location promotion problem in which given one target location and the number of seeds, the purpose is to maxi-mize the number of influenced users. Note that the location promotion problem is di ff erent from the prior work [16] in that a target location is specified.

Intuitively, the location promotion problem can be mod-eled as an influence maximization problem in LBSNs. Ex-plicitly, given a set of nodes and edges with the propagation probability, a target location and the number of seeds, a set of seed users is derived to maximize the number of influenced users. Notice that one challenging issue behind the locatio n promotion problem is to determine the propagation proba-bilities of edges. By investigating the information of LBSN s (i.e., check-in locations of users and social connections o f users), we thus propose some static propagation probabili-ties. A success influence in LBSNs is that users should follow their friends to check-in at the target location specified. T o achieve this, we claim that user mobility should be consid-ered. If a user never appears in the nearby area of the target location, this user is not likely to visit the target locatio n at all. Figure 1 shows an example of dynamic propagation probabilities in an LBSN. If the target location (the red lo-cation) is on the left side (e.g., US west in Figure 1(a)), use rs on the left side have more chance to visit it since the tar-get location is near their check-in records. The propagation probabilities of edges among users in the left side are higher (bold social connections) than the propagation probabilit ies of edges among users on the right side. On the other hand, if the target location on the right side (e.g., US east in Figure 1(b)), the edges of users on the right side have larger propa-gation probabilities. Therefore, we consider a user mobili ty model for the propagation probability to truly reflect the propagation of information on social connections. If the ta r-get location is changed, the propagation probability shoul d be updated.

From the above example, one should consider the mo-bility model for the location promotion problem. To the best of our knowledge, there are some mobility models to describe users X  check-in behavior in LBSNs [5][6][17]. The mobility models proposed [5][6][17] are all based on the bi-variate Gaussian distribution. However, it is hard to decid e the area around the target location to evaluate the proba-bility of a user visiting the target location from Gaussian-based mobility models, which are based on two-dimensional density functions. Moreover, the Gaussian-based mobility models only describe the coordinates of check-in records bu t do not consider their order. We argue that di ff erent or-ders of check-in records represent di ff erent check-in behav -ior. Therefore, we propose distance-based mobility models to represent individual check-in behavior in LBSNs. We exploit the distance between consequent check-in records t o model individual check-in behavior, where the distances rep-resent individual movement preferences. Moreover, it is ea sy to evaluate the probability of user check-in at the target lo -cation. Thus, our proposed distance-based mobility models are suitable not only to describe individual check-in behav ior but also to determine the propagation probability of edges.
In summary, our major contributions are outlined as fol-lows:
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-tion 2 discusses related works. Section 3 gives a formal def-inition of the location promotion problem and the relation between location promotion and influence maximization in LBSNs. Section 4 presents how to evaluate the propagation probabilities in LBSNs. The experimental results are shown in Section 5. Section 6 concludes this paper.
In this paper, our work is related to the influence max-imization in social networks. Thus, we will present some existing works of influence maximization in social networks . Since the main theme of this paper is to derive the propaga-tion probabilities, we will describe how to set the propaga-tion probabilities in existing works. Note that as our work i s to explore mobility models from check-in records to set the propagation probabilities, we present some research works of modeling user mobility from social media.
The influence maximization problem is to find k users as seeds which can maximize the influence spreads in a social network, and this problem is NP-hard [13]. In general, most works utilize greedy-based algorithms to select the user as aseedwhocouldmaximizethenumberofinfluencedusers until k seeds are selected [13][14]. In [15], the authors pro-pose the CELF algorithm which exploits the submodular property to significantly boost the traditional greedy ap-proach. Moreover, another problem is to evaluate the influ-ence spreads from a seed set. A traditional way is to utilize the Monte Carlo approach [13][14]. However, the computa-tion cost of this approach is expensive since it has to run about 10,000 times for evaluation [13]. In [4], the authors proposed a heuristic algorithm, MIA, to estimate the in-fluence spreads by using the paths to represent the routes of influence among users. For LBSNs, the authors of [21] designed a greedy algorithm to select users with a higher degree and more closely related to the location as seeds in their one-wave di ff usion model for LBSNs. However, the one-wave di ff usion model is not close to real LBSNs. In [16], the authors target the influence maximization problem in LBSNs. Explicitly, given a query region and users X  repre-sentative locations, the output is to derive k seeds with the purpose of maximizing influence spreads. This work is the first work for the influence maximization problem in LBSNs. However, this problem is di ff erent from the location promo-tion problem addressed in this paper. In location promotion , aspecifiedtargetlocationisgiven. Thoughthelocationpro -motion problem could be solved via the influence maximiza-tion problem, we explore user mobility to infer propagation probabilities. These features di ff erentiate our work from ex-isting influence maximization works.
To detect the propagation probability in a social network, some existing approaches use the number of in-degrees [13], afixedvalue[10]andauniformlyrandomvalue[10].How-ever, these approaches are some baseline methods. In social networks, users X  actions indeed reflect real influences. As such, some works focus on learning the propagation prob-ability from action history. In [20], the authors exploited the EM algorithm to learn the probability from the Inde-pendent Cascading Model (ICM). In [9], the authors uti-lized the Bernoulli distribution to model the influence on each social connection. The probability parameter of the Bernoulli distribution is learned from data for every socia l connection, and each probability parameter is the propaga-tion probability of the corresponding edge. Moreover, prio r works [1][3][18] noticed that di ff erent topics have di ff eren t di ff usion results since users have di ff erent topic preferenc es. In LBSNs, this phenomenon is more observable. Users have their locality such that they would not like to move to a far location, even if this location is recommended by their friends. Thus, di ff erent target locations have di ff erent pro p-agation probabilities.
Atrajectoryisasequenceoflocationsorderedbyvis-iting time so that many works aimed at discovering spatio-temporal patterns from trajectories [7][8][12]. To captur ean individual user X  X  check-in behavior, we have to deal with th e spatio and temporal sparsity. In [19], the authors discover ed spatio-temporal patterns from all users X  check-in records in Foursquare. In [22], the authors showed that the major rea-son of check-in is based on their mobility, and the chance of social influence is very low. In [5], the authors had sim-ilar perspectives on weak social influence in LBSNs. The authors proposed PSMM which divides each user X  X  check-ins into three types: work, home and social. The check-in records of each type are modeled by a bivariate Gaussian distribution. Moreover, to distinguish the home and work states of check-in records, they also select the Gaussian dis-tribution to classify the time of check-in records. In [6], t here are two factors considered for users X  check-in behaviors, p er-sonal preference and social influence. Personal preference is modeled by a bivariate Gaussian distribution, and the socia l influence is from the similarity between the user X  X  check-in records and their friends X  check-in records. In [17], the au -thors exploit kernel density estimation (KDE) to model the individual user X  X  check-in records. They provide how to set the parameters of KDE for each user from their check-in records. The KDE approach is Gaussian-based since it is amixturemodelconsistingofbivariateGaussiandistribu-tions. In our work, it is hard for the models to evaluate the probability of a location since we have to decide on an area to compute the probability (the probability of a point in a two-dimensional distribution is 0). Therefore, we use the distance-based approach to model each user X  X  check-in behavior.
In this section, we will give a formal definition of the lo-cation promotion problem in an LBSN. First, the formal definition of an LBSN is as follows:
Definition 1. (LBSN) An LBSN  X  G, C  X  consists of a so-cial network G =  X  U, E  X  ,where U is the set of users, E = { ( u i ,u j ) | asocialconnectionfrom u i to u j , u i ,u u } and the set of check-in records C = { ( u,  X  , t ) } ,where ( u,  X  , t )representsacheck-inrecordwhereauser u checks in at location  X  at time t ,and  X   X  L .Alocation  X  is a coordinate which consists of latitude and longitude.
Then, the formal definition of the location promotion prob-lem on an LBSN is as follows:
Definition 2. (Location Promotion Problem) Given an LBSN  X  G, C  X  ,atargetlocation  X  and a constant k ,thelocationpro-motion problem is to select a set of seeds S , S  X  U ,which has k seeds (to distinguish from other users) to maximize the number of expected influenced users  X  ( S )whowillvisit the target location  X  .
Figure 2 shows the framework of location promotion in an LBSN. In the first step, given a target location, we de-termine the propagation probability of edges in the social
Figure 2: The framework for location promotion graph based on check-in records. In this step, the input of location promotion in an LBSN is transformed to the input of influence maximization on a graph. Based on the social graph and propagation probability of edges from the first step, one could derive the seed set via existing solutions of influence maximization [4] and [15]. One challenging issue i s how to set the propagation probability on social connection s to truly reflect the propagation of information in an LBSN. The following sections will present how to derive propagati on probability of influences among users in the social graph.
In this section, we will propose some methods to derive propagation probability in an LBSN. First, we borrow the concept of prior works in [2][4][9][10][13] and then derive some baselines to determine the propagation probability. Note that in the location promotion problem, the given tar-get location has an impact on the propagation probabilities . Thus, we explore the mobility models to derive the propa-gation probability in Section 4.2.
In this part, we will show the traditional approaches for determining the propagation probability on edges in social networks. By referring to prior works [2][4][9][10][13], w e have seven approaches to derive the propagation probabilit y p u  X  v of edge ( u, v )thatisformulatedasfollows:
Uniform probability: All edges are assigned to the same probability [10].
Trivalency: All edges are assigned to the probability se-lected from { 0 . 1 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 001 } uniformly [4].
In-degree of nodes: The propagation probability from u to v is the in-degree of v [13]. where deg ( v )denotesthein-degreeof v .Thepropagation probability is higher if the in-degree of v is lower.
Jaccard index of friends: The Jaccard index is used to measure the similarity between two sets. Here, we select the Jaccard index to measure the similarity between two users X  friendships as the propagation probability if the edge ( u, v ) exists [9]. where adj ( u )denotesthesetof u  X  X  friends. The propagation probability is higher if most friends of u and v are the same.
Jaccard index of locations: For LBSNs, we selected the Jaccard index of locations from two users X  check-ins as the propagation probability if the edge ( u, v )exists[2]. where loc ( u )denotesthesetof u  X  X  visited locations. The propagation probability is higher if most visited location sof u and v are the same.

Cosine of locations: To consider the check-in times of locations, we convert the user X  X  check-in records as a vecto r, in which the dimensions are locations and the values of each dimension are the check-in times of this location. Thus, we can measure the similarity via cosine from two users X  check-in records. where # L u (  X  )denotesthenumberoftimes u visited  X  .The propagation probability is higher if not only most visited locations of u and v are the same, but also the if check-in times of the visited locations are similar.

Bernoulli distribution: Given two check-in records of two users connected by a social connection, we can calcu-late the times of influence. For each check-in, we can know whether another user has checked-in at the same location after the check-in. If yes, then the influence is success; oth -erwise, it is failure. The probability of successful influen ce is from the Bernoulli distribution. To find the success prob-ability in Bernoulli distribution from the records, the result from the maximum likelihood estimator is as follows [9]. where # I u ( v )denotesthetimesofsuccessfulinfluencefrom u to v .Thepropagationprobabilityishigherifthesuccess chance of influence attempt from u to v is higher.
In LBSNs, the information propagation is di ff erent from in traditional social networks since users have to perform check-in at the target location to spread the information. Figure 3 shows an example of information propagation in an LBSN. u 1 is active such that u 1  X  X  friend u 2 will receive the information of the target location from u 1  X  X  check-in sharing. From the perspective of influence maximization, the propagation probability of the edge from u 1 to u 2 is the probability of activating u 2 from u 1 [13]. Thus, in LB-SNs, this probability is the probability of u 2 checks-in at the target location. If u 2 does, the information of the tar-get location will propagate to u 2  X  X  friend, u 3 .InFigure3, u 2 and u 3 have 70% and 60% to check-in at the target lo-cation, respectively. Thus, the propagation probabilitie sof the edge ( u 1 ,u 2 )and( u 2 ,u 3 )are0 . 7and0 . 6, respectively. Clearly, if the target location is changed, the probabiliti es will be changed. To infer whether each user will checks-in at the target location, we explore the mobility model in an Figure 3: An example of information propagation in an LBSN LBSN to infer the propagation probability in LBSNs. There are two kinds of mobility model proposed: one is Gaussian-based models and the other is distance-based models. Based on these two models, we further derive the corresponding probability functions.
Prior works [5][6] utilize the Gaussian-based mobility mod -els to model individual users X  check-in behavior in LBSNs. However, in prior works [5][6], the mobility model is tempo-ral related. In our work, we do not care about the probabil-ity of a location at a specific time since we just care about whether each user visits the target location or not. Thus, we show three major types of Gaussian-based mobility model based on existing works [5][6].
 Gaussian-based mobility model (denoted as GMM-Basic): This is the basic form of Gaussian-based mobility model. Each user is modeled by one bivariate Gaussian dis-tribution. Given the check-in records { ( u,  X  =( x, y ) ,t ) } of user u ,the u  X  X  mobility model is as follows: and the parameters of p (  X  )canbeestimatedbythefollowing equations: n = |{ ( u,  X  =( x, y ) ,t ) }| , X   X  = 1 n ! [ x, y ]and  X   X  = 1 n ! ([ x, y ]  X   X   X  ) T ([ x, y ]  X   X   X  ).
 Figure 4(a) shows an example of GMM-Basic. Only one Gaussian distribution represents each user X  X  check-in beh av-ior. On the left side, GMM-Basic has higher probability den-sity, but there is no check-in record there. Thus, only one Gaussian distribution could not describe each user X  X  check -in behavior well.

Gaussian-based mixture mobility model based on spatial information (denoted as GMM-Spatial): Each user X  X  check-in records can be divided into several states, and each state can be modeled by one Gaussian distribution. Given the check-in records { ( u,  X  =( x, y ) ,t ) } of user u , u  X  X  mobility model is as follows: where K is the number of states, p (  X  | Z i )denotestheprob-ability density of  X  in the state Z i ,and p ( Z i )denotesthe Figure 5: Histogram of the check-in timestamp of a user in a day. The states correspond to Figure 4(c) probability of state Z i . p ( Z i )andtheparametersof p (  X  | Z can be learned by the EM algorithm.

As presented in [5], K is set to 2 and these states represent the home and work states. Figure 4(b) shows an example of GMM-Spatial with two states. The user has 75 check-in records in the area with latitude between 30 . 3N and 30 . 6N, and longitude between 97 . 9W and 97 . 7W. Note that the x-axis is longitude and the y-axis is latitude. Two Gaussian distributions are used to represent each user X  X  check-in be -havior with two di ff erent states. Obviously, GMM-Spatial is better than GMM-Basic for describing each user X  X  check-in behavior. However, each state could not be well represented by one Gaussian distribution such as state 2 in Figure 4(b).
Gaussian-based mixture mobility model based on temporal information (denoted as GMM-Temporal): Since users may have di ff erent states of check-in behavior at di ff erent time, wrapped Gaussian distribution 1 is selected to describe the work state and home state on the timeline [5]. Given the check-in records { ( u,  X  =( x, y ) ,t ) } of user u , u  X  X  mobility model is the same as GMM-Spatial (Equation 2) and is also learned via the EM algorithm. However, in the E-step of the EM algorithm, the check-in records are classified by the Bayesian classifier on the timeline in one
In [5], the authors selected the truncated Gaussian distri-bution for the time distribution. However, the time of a day is circular. Thus, the wrapped Gaussian distribution is better than truncated Gaussian distribution for the time distribution here. Figure 6: An example of calculating the propagation probability in GMMs day. The PDF of a time t of each state is as follows: where the time t is mapped into [0 , 2  X  ).

Figure 4(c) shows an example of GMM-Temporal with two states, and Figure 5 shows the corresponding check-in time distribution in a day. The distribution is not obvious to dis -tinguish into two bivariate Gaussian distributions since t he check-in records are classified by the timestamp but not the coordinate. Thus, the two bivariate Gaussian distribution s overlap. However, for each type of check-in record, it is als o hard to describe the check-in records completely.
Deriving propagation probability: The Gaussian-based mobility models are two-dimensional distribution. Thus, it is necessary to select a region to calculate the probability . Figure 6 shows an example of calculating the propagation probability in GMMs, where the target location  X  ,andthe region R around  X  are controlled by  X  x an  X  y .Theproba-bility of u checking in at  X  is as follows: where the p (  X  )isfromEquation1or2. Thepropagation probability of edge ( v, u )istheprobabilityof u checking in at the target location  X  .Hencethepropagationprobability of the edge from v to u is as follows: where u follows v in an LBSN. However, it is hard to set the size of  X  x and  X  y .Thus,wewillshowanotherapproachto derive the propagation probability in an LBSN.

Estimation error: The estimation error describe the error between the mobility model from observations and real mobility model. Here we select Mean Square Error (MSE) to describe the situation. The details are as follows: and Thus, the MSE of  X   X  and  X   X  are O ( 1 n ), where n denotes the number of check-in records.
Since it is hard to calculate the probability from Gaussian-based Mobility Models, we use the distance instead of coor-dination of location to describe each user X  X  mobility model . Figure 7: The concept of the distance-based mobility model Moreover, using a Gaussian-based mobility model can not capture the order of the check-in records. We argue that di ff erent orders of check-in records have di ff erent mobility models. However, the distance-based mobility model takes the order of check-in records into account. Thus, we select the distance as an important feature to capture each user X  X  check-in behavior.
 Distance-based mobility model (denoted as DMM-Basic): The idea of distance-based mobility models is that it estimates the probability of a user moving from their vis-ited locations to the target location. Therefore, distance -based mobility models have two layers. The first layer is the stationary distribution of visited locations, and the seco nd layer is the probability density of moving from the visited locations to the target location. The stationary distribut ion is from random walk with restart since it is used to simulate the movements of moving objects [11]. Moreover, we select the Pareto distribution for the distance distribution sinc e the movement distance in LBSNs has a self-similar property [23]. Based on the concept above, the probability density of alocation  X  , p u (  X  ), can be shown as follows: p u (  X  )= &amp; where p ( u ) l denotes the stationary probability of user u at sity of user u moving from a visited location l to the target location  X  ,and d ( l,  X  )denotesthedistancebetween l and  X  .
Figure 7 shows an example of the distance-based mobil-ity model. The user u has three visited locations  X  1 ,  X  and  X  3 .Thestationaryprobabilitiesof  X  1 ,  X  2 and  X  3 are p check-in records ( u,  X  1 ,t 1 ), ( u,  X  2 ,t 2 ), ( u,  X  and ( u,  X  3 ,t 5 ), where t i &lt;t j if i&lt;j .Thus,thetransi-tion probabilities are P (  X  1  X   X  2 )=0 . 5, P (  X  1  X   X  P (  X  2  X   X  3 )=1and P (  X  3  X   X  1 )=1. Thenthestation-ary distribution of locations is p ( u )  X  p initial distribution of  X  1 ,  X  2 and  X  3 is uniform.
The distance distribution is described by the Pareto dis-tribution. The form of Pareto distribution is as follows: Figure 9: The distribution of distance of next move-ment in two di ff erent datasets where  X  is the shape parameter and  X  is the minimum of x . Since  X  cannot be 0, we fix  X  =1. Thus,theEquation6 can be written as follows: To utilize Pareto distribution to describe the movement dis -tance of each user, we have to evaluate a suitable  X  for each user from their distance observations. Assume there are n distance observations x 1 , x 2 ,  X  X  X  , x n .Since  X  is fixed to 1andtheminimumof x i is 0, x i is shifted 1 to y i where y = x i +1. BasedonMLE,theestimator of  X  is as follows: Figure 8(a) shows an example of DMM-Basic. DMM-Basic is more representative than GMMs for individual check -in behavior. If we modify the order of the check-in records, Figure 8(b) shows the result. If the order is modified, the model is di ff erent in DMM. It is di ff erent from GMMs since GMMs focus on the coordinates of the check-in records but not on the relation between check-in records. There are two di ff erences if the order is modified. First, the distribution of higher probability density in Figure 8(a) is di ff erent fro m the distribution of higher probability density in Figure 8( a). It shows that the stationary distribution is changed if the order is modified. Second, the distribution probability den -sity in Figure 8(b) is smoother. It shows that the user is more likely to move to distant locations.

Distance-based mobility model with social infor-mation (denoted as DMM-Social): Users X  check-in be-havior can be influenced by their friends in LBSNs [5][22]. Therefore, the moving distances are divided into two parts, self movement behavior and social influenced moving be-havior. Self movement behavior means that the movement is based on their movement behavior, and social influenced moving behavior means the movement is influenced by their friends. Figure 9 shows the distribution of distance of next movement in two di ff erent datasets. The distributions can be divided into two parts. Similar observations are also found in [5]. The distance-based with social mobility model can be shown as follows: p (  X  )= &amp; where p (M) and p (S) denote the probability of a distance contributed by mobility and social influence, respectively . bility of moving d ( l,  X  )contributedbymobilityandsocial influence, respectively. p (M), p (S) and the parameters of f
M ( d ( l,  X  )) and f gorithm. The Pareto distribution is also utilized for the distance distribution f ( u ) M (  X  )and f ( u ) S (  X  ). Figure 8(c) shows an example of DMM-Social. DMM-Social is smoother than the DMM-Basic in Figure 8(a) and 8(b). It reflects the distance which will be influenced by friends in Figure 9. Moreover, the coordinate of check-in records is also considered.

Deriving propagation probability: If a user tends to travel a larger distance than that between the user and the target location, there is a higher chance that the user will visit the target location. Thus, to calculate the probabili ty based on a distance-based mobility model, we just calculate the probability of moving the distance which exceeds the dis -tance between the visited locations and the target location . Thus, the probability of u check-in at  X  is as follows: Furthermore, in DMM-Basic, the probability is as follows: where  X   X  is from Equation 8. Then, in DMM-Social, the probability is as follows: where p (M), p (M),  X   X  M and  X   X  S are from Equation 9. Fur-thermore, the propagation probability on edges is also the same as in Equation 4.

Estimation error: The estimation error of the distance-based mobility model is as follows: The MSE of  X   X  is O ( 1 n ). The results 2 show that the estima-tion error of the distance-based mobility models is similar to the estimation error of the Gaussian-based mobility models.
In this section, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the e ff ectiveness of our proposed mobility models, GMMs and DMMs. Moreover, we also show the results of static propagation probability and location-aware propaga-tion probability in LBSNs. We implemented the proposed models in Python.
In this paper, we have selected the gowalla and brightkite datasets [5] for observation and evaluation 3 .Thereare196,591 users, 950,327 social connections and 6,442,890 check-ins during February 2009 -October 2010 in the gowalla dataset. Moreover, there are 58,228 users, 214,078 social connectio ns and 4,491,143 check-ins during April 2008 -October 2010 in the brightkite dataset.
To compare the performance of di ff erent mobility mod-els, log-likelihood is selected to measure the mobility mod -els for LBSNs since the mobility model is a two-dimensional probability density distribution [5][6][17]. If the value of log-likelihood is higher, the mobility model represents the rea l check-in behavior of each user well. Due to the spatial and temporal sparsity issue of check-in records, most users sel -dom perform check-in records (10  X  100 records). Therefore, we observe the relation between the number of training data and log-likelihood of each mobility model here. The propor-tion of training and testing of check-in records are 80% and
The approximation is based on the delta method.
Both of these datasets are public datasets which can be downloaded from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/.

The details of the number of users are given in Table 1.

Figure 10 shows the results of comparison with di ff er-ent numbers of training records in the two datasets. In the gowalla dataset, DMMs present higher log-likelihood value than GMMs. Since the state-of-the-art approaches [5][6][17] proposed Gaussian-based mobility models, our p ro-posed GMMs further consider spatial and temporal informa-tion. As shown in Figure 10, DMMs can better reflect indi-vidual check-in behavior than GMMs, which demonstrates the advantage of DMMs. However, when the number of training data is 70, all approaches have higher log-likelih ood value. It can be considered as a bias since the number of data which contain 70 training records is lower than oth-ers (Table 1). On the other hand, DMM-Social has higher log-likelihood value than DMM-Basic. By exploring social information in LBSNs, DMM-Social is closer to real indi-vidual check-in behavior. Furthermore, DMMs can capture individual check-in behavior by only 10 training records. I t shows that DMMs deal with the spatial and temporal spar-sity issue of check-in records. The results in brightkite ar e similar to the results in gowalla. However, the amplitude of GMMs is large since the number of data we selected is lower.
In DMMs, the Pareto distribution is selected to repre-sent the distance of the next movement of each user. Some related distributions (such as exponential and log-normal distribution) are listed. The domain of these two distribu-tions is [0 ,  X  ), and they are related to Pareto and Gaussian distribution, respectively. To compare di ff erent distance dis-tributions in DMMs, DMM-Basic is selected since it is the simplest form in DMMs. Then, the distance distribution in DMM-Basic is replaced with exponential and log-normal dis-tribution, respectively. The modified DMM-Basic is called DMM-Exponential and DMM-Lognormal, respectively.
 Figure 11 shows the results of the comparison of DMM-Basic, DMM-Exponential and DMM-Lognormal.

DMM-Exponential has the lowest log-likelihood value such that t he distance of next movement is not memoryless. Finally, the results show that the Pareto distribution is more suitable for the distance of next movements in LBSNs than the ex-ponential and log-normal distribution in both datasets.
To compare di ff erent approaches to set propagation prob-ability, the ROC curve is selected to show the results of di ff erent global activation thresholds [1][9]. Two target l oca-tions are selected: one is San Francisco Caltrain Station, S an Francisco (37 . 776430N 122 . 394318W), and the other is Cen-tral Park, New York City (40 . 780606N 73 . 968088W). More-over, we only selected users who have 10 check-in records or above. There are 67,653 users and 629,031 edges selected in the gowalla dataset, and 24,100 users and 243,922 edges selected in the brightkite dataset. To determine whether a user is active or not, we set the active range of the target location. Note that the active range is also used to calculat e the propagation probability of GMMs. If one of the user X  X  check-in records is in the active range, the user is active in the ground truth. In the experiments, the radius of the active range is set to 500m. For the approaches in static propagation probability, five approaches are selected in th e (a) New York City, gowalla (c) New York City, brightkite Figure 13: The results of five approaches for location-aware propagation probability in di ff erent LBSNs experiments, where In-degree denotes in-degree of nodes, Jaccard Fdenotesjaccardindexoffriends,Jaccard Lde-notes jaccard index of locations, Cosine denotes cosine of locations, and Bernoulli denotes Bernoulli estimator.
Figure 12 shows the results of five approaches for static propagation probability. In the gowalla dataset (Figure 12 (a) and 12(b)), Bernoulli performs well than other approaches of static probability but not significant. Although Bernoul li learns from history records, it can not adapt to the infor-mation propagation in LBSNs. The ROC curves of Jac-card F, Jaccard LandCosineareclosesttothediagonal. Thus, the number of common friends and locations are not related to the information propagation in LBSNs. Further-more, In-degree, the most common used method in social networks [4][13][16], is worse than random guess. Thus, the in-degree of nodes and the degree of information propagatio n in LBSNs are not helpful in the location promotion problem. Finally, the results show that the ROC curves of five ap-proaches are closed to the diagonal in both target locations . From the above experimental results, the static propagatio n probability is not able to truly reflect the information prop -agation in LBSNs. The results in the brightkite dataset are shown in Figure 12(c) and 12(d), and these results depict the similar phenomenon.

Figure 13 shows the results of five approaches for location-aware propagation probability. In the gowalla dataset (Fig -ure 13(a) and 13(b)), DMM-Basic has the largest AUC (Stand-ing for Area Under Curve), where the target location is set to NYC. On the other hand, DMM-Basic and DMM-Social have similar AUC when the target location is set to San Francisco. Both DMM-Basic and DMM-Social has a bet-ter performance with di ff erent target locations. Moreover, GMMs have the lowest AUC and these curves of GMMs are close to the diagonal, where the diagonal curve represents the results of random guess. The reason is that the location-aware propagation probability from GMMs is controlled by the area around the target location. If the area is large, and then the probability is higher. It reflects the disadvan-tage that it is hard to derive the location-aware propagatio n probability from GMMs. Particularly, The GMM-Spatial has the best performance in GMMs. It shows individual check-in behavior can be divided into many states by spatial information. However, GMM-Spatial is limited by the disad-vantage of calculating location-aware propagation of GMMs . As such, GMM-Spatial has lower AUC than DMMs. Finally, DMMs have larger AUC than GMMs, which indicates that DMMs are suitable to reflect the information propagation and derive the location-aware propagation in LBSNs. The results shown in Figure 13(c) and 13(d) are experiments in the brightkite dataset, which indicate the similar results in the gowalla dataset.
In this paper, we addressed on the location promotion problem in LBSNs. Explicitly, the location promotion prob-lem is formulated as an influence maximization problem. Given a target location and an LBSN, we aimed at deriving asetof k seed users to maximize the number of influenced users to visit the target location. The most challenging is to derive the propagation probability with di ff erent target locations in LBSNs. By referring to prior works on influ-ence maximization, we developed some baselines to deter-mine the propagation probabilities. Note that we claimed that user mobility should be considered in deriving propa-gation probabilities in LBSNs. Users should reach/visit th e target location and thus will spread the target location inf or-mation to their friends. Since the information propagation is triggered by check-in in LBSNs, we propose Gaussian-based mobility models, GMMs, and distance-based mobility models, DMMs, to capture individual check-in behavior in LBSNs. DMMs have the advantage of not only capturing individual check-in behavior but also deriving the propaga -tion probability in LBSNs. The experimental results show that DMMs perform better than other state-of-the-art ap-proaches in terms of capturing individual check-in behav-ior and dealing with the spatial and temporal sparsity issue of the check-in data since it considers not only corrdinates of check-in records but also the relations between check-in records. Moreover, DMMs really reflects the dynamic prop-agation probability with di ff erent target locations in LBSN s.
