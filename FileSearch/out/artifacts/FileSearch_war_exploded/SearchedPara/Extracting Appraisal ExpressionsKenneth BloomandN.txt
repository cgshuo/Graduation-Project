 Sentiment analysis, which seeks to analyze opin-ion in natural language text, has grown in interest in recent years. Sentiment analysis includes a vari-ety of different problems, including: sentiment clas-sification techniques to classify reviews as positive or negative, based on bag of words (Pang et al., 2002) or positive and negative words (Turney, 2002; Mullen and Collier, 2004); classifying sentences in a document as either subjective or objective (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004); identifying or classifying appraisal targets (Nigam and Hurst, 2004); identifying the source of an opinion in a text (Choi et al., 2005), whether the author is expressing the opinion, or whether he is attributing the opinion to someone else; and developing interactive and vi-sual opinion mining methods (Gamon et al., 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005). Much of this work has utilized the fundamental concept of  X  X emantic orien-tation X , (Turney, 2002); however, sentiment analysis still lacks a  X  X nified field theory X .

We propose in this paper that a fundamental task underlying many of these formulations is the extrac-tion and analysis of appraisal expressions , defined as those structured textual units which express an evaluation of some object. An appraisal expression has three main components: an attitude (which takes an evaluative stance about an object), a target (the object of the stance), and a source (the person tak-ing the stance) which may be implied.

The idea of appraisal extraction is a generaliza-tion of problem formulations developed in earlier works. Mullen and Collier X  X  (2004) notion of classi-fying appraisal terms using a multidimensional set of attributes is closely tied to the definition of an appraisal expression, which is classified along sev-eral dimensions. In previous work (Whitelaw et al., 2005), we presented a related technique of find-ing opinion phrases, using a multidimensional set of attributes and modeling the semantics of mod-ifiers in these phrases. The use of multiple text classifiers by Wiebe and colleagues (Wilson et al., 2005; Wiebe et al., 2004) for various kinds of senti-ment classification can also be viewed as a sentence-level technique for analyzing appraisal expressions. Nigam and Hurst X  X  (2004) work on detecting opin-ions about a certain topic presages our notion of connecting attitudes to targets, while Popescu and Etzioni X  X  (2005) opinion mining technique also fits well into our framework.

In this paper we describe a system for extracting adjectival appraisal expressions, based on a hand-built lexicon, a combination of heuristic shallow parsing and dependency parsing, and expectation-maximization word sense disambiguation. Each ex-tracted appraisal expression is represented as a set of feature values in terms of its evaluative function in the text. We have applied this system to two domains of texts: product reviews, and movie reviews. Man-ual evaluation of the extraction shows our system to work well, as well as giving some directions for im-provement. We also show how straightforward data mining can give users very useful information about public opinion. We define an appraisal expression to be an elemen-tary linguistic unit that conveys an attitude of some kind towards some target. An appraisal expression is defined to comprise a source , an attitude , and a target , each represented by various attributes. For example, in  X  X  found the movie quite monotonous X , the speaker (the Source ) expresses a negative Atti-tude ( X  X uite monotonous X ) towards  X  X he movie X  (the Target ). Note that attitudes come in different types; for example,  X  X onotonous X  describes an inherent quality of the Target, while  X  X oathed X  would describe the emotional reaction of the Source.

Attitude may be expressed through nouns, verbs, adjectives and metaphors. Extracting all of this in-formation accurately for all of these types of ap-praisal expressions is a very difficult problem. We therefore restrict ourselves for now to adjectival ap-praisal expressions that are each contained in a sin-gle sentence. Additionally, we focus here only on extracting and analyzing the attitude and the target, but not the source. Even with these restrictions, we obtain interesting results (Sec. 7). 2.1 Appraisal attributes Our method is grounded in Appraisal Theory, devel-oped by Martin and White (2005), which analyzes the way opinion is expressed. Following Martin and White, we define: Attitude type is type of appraisal being Orientation is whether the attitude is positive Figure 1: The Attitude Type taxonomy, with exam-ples of adjectives from the lexicon. Force describes the intensity of the appraisal. Force Polarity of an appraisal is marked if it is scoped in Target type is a domain-dependent semantic type 2.2 Target taxonomies Two domain-dependent target type taxonomies are shown in Figure 2. In both, the primary distinction is between a direct naming of a kind of  X  X hing X  or a deictic/pronominal reference (e.g.,  X  X hose X  or  X  X t X ), since the system does not currently rely on corefer-ence resolution. References are further divided into references to the writer/reader ( X  X nteractants X ) and to other people or objects.

The Thing subtrees for the two domains dif-fer somewhat. In the movie domain, Things such as  X  X his movie X ,  X  X icholas Cage X , or  X  X inematogra-phy X , are classified into six main categories: movies (the one being reviewed, or another one), people Figure 2: Target taxonomies for movie and product reviews. (whether characters, or real people involved in mak-ing the film), aspects of the movie itself (its plot, special effects, etc.), the companies involved in mak-ing it, or aspects of marketing the movie (such as trailers). For target Things in product reviews, we replace  X  X ovie Person X  and  X  X ovie Aspect X  by  X  X roduct Part X  with two subcategories:  X  X ntegral X , for parts of the product itself (e.g., wheels or lenses), and  X  X eplaceable X , for parts or supplies meant to be periodically replaced (e.g., batteries or ink car-tridges). The categories of  X  X upport X , for references to aspects of customer support, and  X  X xperience X  for things associated with the experience of using the product (such as  X  X ictures X  or  X  X esolution X , were also added. In our system, appraisal extraction runs in several in-dependent stages. First, the appraisal extractor finds appraisal expressions by finding the chunks of text that express attitudes and targets. Then, it links each attitude group found to a target in the text. Finally, it uses a probabilistic model to determine which atti-tude type should be assigned when attitude chunks were ambiguous. 3.1 Chunking The chunker is based on our earlier work (Whitelaw et al., 2005), which finds attitude groups and tar-gets using a hand-built lexicon (Sec. 4). This lexi-con contains head adjectives (which specify values for the attributes attitude type , force , polarity , and orientation ), and appraisal modifiers (which specify transformations to the four attributes). Some head adjectives are ambiguous, having multiple entries in the lexicon with different attribute values. In all cases, different entries for a given word have dif-ferent attitude types. If the head adjective is am-biguous, multiple groups are created, to be disam-biguated later. See our previous work (Whitelaw et al., 2005) for a discussion of the technique.
Target groups are found by matching phrases in the lexicon with corresponding phrases in the text and assigning the target type listed in the lexicon. 3.2 Linking After finding attitude groups and candidate targets, the system links each attitude to a target. Each sentence is parsed to a dependency representation, and a ranked list of linkage specifications is used to look for paths in the dependency tree connecting some word in the source to some word in the target. Such linkage specifications are hand-constructed, and manually assigned priorities, so that when two linkage specifications match, only the highest prior-ity specification is used. For example, the two high-est priority linkage specifications are: 1. target nsubj  X  X  X  X  X  X  x dobj  X  X  X  X  y amod  X  X  X  X  X  X  attitude 2. attitude amod  X  X  X  X  X  X  target
The first specification selects the subject of a sen-tence where the appraisal modifies a noun in the predicate, for example  X  X he Matrix X  in  X  X he Matrix is a good movie X . The second selects the noun mod-ified by an adjective group, for example  X  X ovie X  in  X  X he Matrix is a good movie X .

If no linkage is found connecting an attitude to a candidate target, the system goes through the link-age specifications again, trying to find any word in the sentence connected to the appraisal group by a known linkage. The selected word is assigned the generic category of movie thing or product thing (de-pending on the domain of the text). If no linkage is found at all, the system assigns the default category movie thing or product thing , assuming that there is an appraised thing that couldn X  X  be found using the given linkage specifications. 3.3 Disambiguation After linkages are made, this information is used to disambiguate multiple senses that may be present in a given appraisal expression. Most cases are unambiguous, but in some cases two, or occasion-ally even three, senses are possible. We bootstrap from the unambiguous cases, using a probabilistic model, to resolve the ambiguities. The attitude type places some grammatical/semantic constraints on the clause. Two key constraints are the syntactic relation with the target (which can differentiate af-fect from the other types of appraisal), and whether the target type has consciousness (which helps dif-ferentiate judgment and affect from appreciation ). To capture these constraints, we model the proba-bility of a given attitude type being correct, given the target type and the linkage specification used to connect the attitude to the target, as follows.
The correct attitude type of an appraisal expres-sion is modeled by a random variable A , the set of all attitude types in the system is denoted by A , and a specific attitude type is denoted by a . As described above, other attributes besides attitude type may also vary between word senses, but attitude type always changes between word senses, so when the system assigns a probability to an attitude type , it is assigning that probability to the whole word sense.
We denote the linkage type used in a given ap-praisal expression by L , the set of all possible link-ages as L , and a specific linkage type by l . Note that the first attempt with a linkage specification (to find a chunked target) is considered to be different from the second attempt with the same linkage specifica-tion (which attempts to find any word). Failure to find an applicable linkage rule is considered as yet another  X  X inkage X  for the probability model. Since our system uses 29 different linkage specifications, there are a total of 59 different possible linkages type s.

The target type of a given appraisal expression is denoted by T , the set of all target type s by T , and a specific target type by t . We consider an expression to have a given target type T = t only if that is its specific target type; if its target type is a descendant of t , then its target type is not t in the model. E denotes the set of all extracted appraisal expressions. The term exp denotes a specific expression.
Our goal is to estimate, for each appraisal expres-sion exp in the corpus, the probability of its attitude type being a , given the expression X  X  target type t and linkage type l To do this, we define a model M of this probability, and then estimate the maximum likelihood model using Expectation-Maximization.

We model P M ( A = a | T = t, L = l ) by first applying Bayes X  theorem: Assuming conditional independence of target type and linkage , this becomes: P M ( T = t | A = a ) P M ( L = l | A = a ) P M ( A = a ) M  X  X  parameters thus represent the conditional and marginal probabilities on this right-hand-side.
Given a set of (possibly ambiguous) appraisal ex-pressions E identified by chunking and linkage de-tection, we seek the maximum likelihood model M  X  will be our best estimate of P , given the pro-cessed data in a given corpus. The system esti-mates M  X  using an implementation of Expectation-Maximization over the entire corpus. The highest-probability attitude type (hence sense) according to M is then chosen for each appraisal expression. As noted above, attitude groups were identified via a domain-independent lexicon of appraisal adjectives, adverbs, and adverb modifiers. 1 For the movie domain, appraised things were identified based on a manually constructed lexicon containing generic movie words, as well as automatically constructed lexicons of proper names specific to each movie be-ing reviewed. For each product type considered, we manually constructed a lexicon containing generic product words; we did not find it necessary to con-struct product-specific lexicons.
For adjectival attitudes, we used the lexicon developed we developed in our previous work (Whitelaw et al., 2005) on appraisal. We reviewed the entire lexicon to determine its accuracy and made numerous improvements.

Generic target lexicons were constructed by start-ing with a small sample of the kind of reviews that the lexicon would apply to. We examined these manually to find generic words referring to ap-praised things to serve as seed terms for the lexicon and used WordNet (Miller, 1995) to suggest addi-tional terms to add to the lexicon.

Since movie reviews often refer to the specific contents of the movie under review by proper names (of actors, the director, etc.), we also automatically constructed a specific target lexicon for each movie in the corpus, based on lists of actors, characters, writers, directors, and companies listed for the film at imdb.com . Each such specific lexicon was only used for processing reviews of the movie it was gen-erated for, so the system had no specific knowledge of terms related to other movies during processing. We evaluated our appraisal extraction system on two corpora. The first is the standard publicly available collection of movie reviews constructed by Pang and Lee (2004). This standard testbed consists of 1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews, taken from the IMDb movie review archives 2 . Reviews with  X  X eu-tral X  scores (such as three stars out of five) were re-moved by Pang and Lee, giving a data set with only clearly positive and negative reviews. The average document length in this corpus is 764 words, and 1107 different movies are reviewed.

The second corpus is a collection of user prod-uct reviews taken from epinions.com supplied in 2004 for research purposes by Amir Ashkenazi of Shopping.Com. The base collection contains re-views for three types of products: baby strollers, dig-ital cameras, and printers. Each review has a numer-ical rating (1 X 5); based on this, we labeled positive and negative reviews in the same way as Pang and Lee did for the movie reviews corpus. The prod-ucts corpus has 15162 documents, averaging 442 words long. This comprises 11769 positive docu-ments, 1420 neutral documents, and 1973 negative documents. There are 905 reviews of strollers, 5778 reviews of ink-jet printers and 8479 reviews of digi-tal cameras, covering 516 individual products.
Each document in each corpus was preprocessed into individual sentences, lower-cased, and tok-enized. We used an implementation of Brill X  X  (1992) part-of-speech tagger to find adjectives and modi-fiers; for parsing, we used the Stanford dependency parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). We performed two manual evaluations on the sys-tem. The first was to evaluate the overall accuracy of the entire system. The second was to specifi-cally evaluate the accuracy of the probabilistic dis-ambiguator. 6.1 Evaluating Accuracy We evaluated randomly selected appraisal expres-sions for extraction accuracy on a number of binary measures. This manual evaluation was performed by the first author.We evaluated interrater reliability between this rater and another author on 200 ran-domly selected appraisal expressions (100 on each corpus). The first rater rated an additional 120 ex-pressions (60 for each corpus), and combined these with his ratings for interrater reliability to compute system accuracy, for a total of 320 expressions (160 for each corpus). The (binary) rating criteria were as follows. Relating to the appraisal group: APP Does the expression express appraisal at all? ARM If so, does the appraisal group have all rele-HEM Does the appraisal group include extra mod-Relating to the target: HT If there is appraisal, is there an identifiable tar-FT If there is appraisal, did the system identify RT If so, is it the correct one? Relating to the expression X  X  attribute values (if it ex-presses appraisal): Att Is the attitude type assigned correct? Ori Is the orientation assigned correct? Pol Is the polarity assigned correct? Tar Is the target type assigned correct? Pre Is the target type the most precise value in the Table 1: System accuracy at evaluated tasks. 95% confidence one-proportion z-intervals are reported. Table 2: Interrater reliability of manual evaluation. 95% confidence intervals are reported.

Results are given in Table 1, and interrater relia-bility is given in Table 2. In nearly all cases agree-ment percentages are above 80%, indicating good inter-rater consensus. Regarding precision, we note that most aspects of extraction seem to work quite well. The area of most concern in the system is precision of target classification. This may be im-proved with further development of the target lex-icons to classify more terms to specific leaves in the target type hierarchy. The other area of con-cern is the APP test, which encountered difficulties when a word could be used as appraisal in some contexts, but not in others, particularly when an ap-praisal word appeared as a nominal classifier. 6.2 Evaluating Disambiguation The second experiment evaluated the accuracy of EM in disambiguating the attitude type of appraisal expressions. We evaluated the same number of ex-pressions as used for the overall accuracy experi-ment (100 used for interrater reliability and accu-racy, plus 60 used only for accuracy on each corpus), each having two or more word senses, presenting all of the attitude type s possible for each appraisal ex-pression, as well as a  X  X one of the above X  and a  X  X ot appraisal X  option, asking the rater to select which one applied to the selected expression in context.
Baseline disambiguator accuracy, if the computer were to simply pick randomly from the choices specified in the lexicon is 48% for both corpora. In-terrater agreement was 80% for movies and 73% for products (taken over 100 expressions from each cor-pus.)
Considering just those appraisal expressions which the raters decided were appraisal, the dis-ambiguator achieved 58% accuracy on appraisal ex-pressions from the movies corpus and 56% accuracy on the products corpus. Further analysis of the re-sults of the disambiguator shows that most of the er-rors occur when the target type is the generic cate-gory thing which occurs when the target is not in the target lexicon. Performance on words recognized as having more specific target type s is better: 68% for movies, and 59% for products. This indicates that specific target type is an important indicator of at-titude type. We (briefly) demonstrate the usefulness of appraisal expression extraction by using it for opinion mining. In opinion mining, we find large numbers of reviews and perform data mining to determine which aspects of a product people like or dislike, and in which ways. To do this, we search for association rules de-scribing the appraisal features that can be found in a single appraisal expression. We generally look for rules that contain attitude type , orientation , thing type , and a product name , when these rules occur more frequently than expected.
 The idea is similar to Agrawal and Srikant X  X  (1995) notion of generalized associa-tion rules. We treat each appraisal expression as a transaction, with the attributes of attitude type , orientation , polarity , force , and thing type , as well as the document attributes product name , product type , and document classification (based on the number of stars the reviewer gave the product). We use CLOSET+ (Wang et al., 2003) to find all of the frequent closed itemsets in the data, with a support greater than or equal to 20 occurrences. Let  X  b, a 1 , a 2 , . . . a n  X  or  X  b, A  X  denote the contents of an itemset, and c (  X  b, A  X  ) denote the support for this itemset. For a given item b ,  X  ( b ) denotes its immediate parent its value taxonomy, or  X  X oot X  for flat sets.
For each item set, we collect rules  X  b, A  X  and compute their interestingness relative to the itemset  X   X  ( b ) , A  X  . Interestingness is defined as follows:
Int is the relative probability of finding the child itemset in an appraisal expression, compared to find-ing it in a parent itemset. Values greater than 1 in-dicate that the child itemset appears more frequently than we would expect.

We applied two simple filters to the output, to help find more meaningful results. Specificity requires that b be a product name, and that attitude type and thing type be sufficiently deep nodes in the hier-archy to describe something specific. (For exam-ple,  X  X roduct thing X  gives no real information about what part of the product is being appraised.) Oppo-sition chooses rules with a different rating than the review as a whole, that is, document classification is the opposite of appraisal orientation . The filter also ensures that thing type is sufficiently specific, as with specificity, and requires that b be a product name.

We present the ten most  X  X nteresting X  rules from each filter, for the products corpus. Rules from the specificity filter are shown in Table 3 and rules from the opposition filter are shown in Table 4. We con-sider the meaning of some of these rules.

The first specificity rule (1) describes a typical ex-ample of users who like the product very well over-all. An example sentence that created this rule says  X  X ot only is it an excellent stroller , because of it X  X  [sic] size it even doubled for us as a portable crib. X  The specificity rules for the Agfa ePhoto Smile Digital Camera (2) are an example of the kind of rule we expect to see when bad user experience con-tributes to bad reviews. The text of the reviews that gave these rules quite clearly convey that users were not happy specifically with the photo quality. In the oppositional rules for the Lexmark Color JetPrinter 1100 (3) , we see that users made positive comments about the product overall, while neverthe-less giving the product a negative review. Drilling down into the text, we can see some examples of re-views like  X  X n the surface it looks like a good printer but it has many flaws that cause it to be frustrating. X  We have presented a new task, appraisal expres-sion extraction , which, we suggest, is a fundamental tasks for sentiment analysis. Shallow parsing based on a set of appraisal lexicons, together with sparse use of syntactic dependencies, can be used to ef-fectively address the subtask of extracting adjectival appraisal expressions. Indeed, straightforward data mining applied to appraisal expressions can yield in-sights into public opinion as expressed in patterns of evaluative language in a corpus of product reviews.
Immediate future work includes extending the ap-proach to include other types of appraisal expres-sions, such as where an attitude is expressed via a noun or a verb. In this regard, we will be examin-ing extension of existing methods for automatically building lexicons of positive/negative words (Tur-ney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) to the more complex task of estimating also attitude type and force . As well, a key problem is the fact that eval-uative language is often context-dependent , and so proper interpretation must consider interactions be-tween a given phrase and its larger textual context.
