 T he field of sentiment analysis has quickly attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners ali ke (e.g. Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004; Wi ebe et al., 2005; Breck et al., 2007; Pang and Lee, 20 08). 1 Indeed, sentiment analysis systems , which mine opinions from textual sources (e.g. news, blogs, and reviews) , can be used in a wide var iety of applications, including interpreting product reviews , opinion r etrieval and political polling. 
Not surprisingly, most methods for sentiment classification are supervised learning techniques, which require training data annotated with the appropria te sentiment labels (e.g. document -level or sentence -level positive vs. negative polarity). This data is difficult and costly to obtain, and must be acquired separately for each language under consideration.

Previous work in multilingual sentiment analys is has therefore focused on methods to adapt sentiment resources (e.g. lexicons) from resource -rich languages (typically English) to other languages, with the goal of transferring sentiment or subjectivity analysis capabilities from English to other langua ge s (e.g. Mihalcea et al. (2007); Banea et al. (2008; 2010); Wan ( 2008; 2009); Prettenhofer and Stein (2010)). In recent years, however, sentiment -labeled data is gradually becoming available for languages other than English (e.g. Seki et al. (2007 ; 2008 ); Nakagawa et al. ( 2010 ) ; Schulz et al. (2010) ). In addition, there is still much room for improvement in existing monolingual (including English) sentiment classifiers, especially at the sentence level (Pang and Lee, 2008). 
This paper tackles the task of b i lingual sentiment analysis. In contrast to previous work, we (1) assume that some amount of sentiment -labeled data is available for the language pair under study , and (2) investigate methods to simultaneously improve sentiment classification for both lan guages . Given the labeled data in each language, we propose an approach that exploit s an unlabeled parallel corpus with the following intuition: two sentences or documents that are parallel (i.e. translations of one another) should exhibit the same sentim ent  X  their sentiment labels (e.g. polarity, subjectivity, intensity) should be similar . The proposed maximum entropy -based EM approach jointly learns two monolingual sentiment classifiers by treat ing the sentiment labels in the unlabeled parallel text as unobserved latent variables , and maximizes the regularized joint likelihood of the language -specific labeled data together with the inferred sentiment labels of the parallel text. Although our approach should be applicable at the document -level and for ad ditional sentiment tasks, we focus on sentence -level polarity classification in this work .
 We evaluate our approach for English and Chinese on two dataset combinations (see Section 4) and find that the proposed approach outperforms the monolingual baseline s (i.e. maximum entropy and SVM classifiers) as well as two alternative methods for leveraging unlabeled data (transductive SVMs ( Joachims , 1999 b ) and co -training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998 )) . Accuracy is significantly improve d for both languages , by 3.44% -8.12%. We furthermore find that improvements, albeit smaller, are obtain ed when the parallel data is replaced with a pseudo -parallel (i.e. automatically translated ) corpus . To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual sentiment analysis study to focus on methods for simultaneously improving sentiment classification for a pair of languages based on unlabeled data rather than resource adaptation from one language to another .
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related work . In Section 3, the proposed joint model is described. Sections 4 and 5, respectively, provide the experimental setup and results ; the conclusion ( Section 6 ) follows . Multilingual Sentiment Analysis. There is a growing body of work on multili ngual sentiment analysis. Most approaches focus on resource ada p t ation from one language (usually English ) to other languages with few sentiment resources . Mihalcea et al. (2007), for example, gene rate subjectivity analysis resources in a new language from English sentiment resources by leveraging a bilingual dictionary or a parallel corpus . Banea et al. (2008; 2010) instead automatically translate the English resources using automatic machine translation engines for subjectivity classification . Prettenhofe r and Stein (2010) investigate cross -lingual sentiment classification from the perspective of domain adaptation based on structural correspondence learning (Blitzer et al., 2006) .

Approaches that do not explicitly involve resource adaptation include Wan (2 009), which uses co -training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998 ) with English vs. Chinese features comprising the two independent  X  X iews X  to exploit unlabeled Chinese data and a labeled English corpus and thereby improves Chinese sentiment classification . Another no table approach is the work of Boyd -Graber and Resnik (2010), which present s a generative model ---supervised multilingual latent Dirichlet allocation ---that jointly models topics that are consistent across languages , and employs them to better predict s entiment ratings .

Unlike the methods described above, we focus on simultaneously improving the performance of sentiment classification in a pair of languages by developing a model that relies on sentiment -labeled data in each language as well as unlabeled parallel text for the language pair.

Semi -supervised Learning . Another line of related work is semi -supervised learning, which combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance of the task of interest (Zhu and Goldberg, 2009). Among the popul ar semi -supervised methods (e.g. EM on Na X ve Bayes (Nigam et al., 2000), co -training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998 ), transductive SVMs ( Joachims , 1999b) , and co -regularization (Sindhwani et al., 2005; Amini et al., 2010) ), our approach employs the EM algorithm, extending it to the bilingual case based on maximum entropy . We compare to co -training and transductive SVMs in Section 5.
Multilingual NLP for Other Tasks. Finally, there exists related work using bilingual resources to help other NLP tasks, such as word sense disambiguation ( e.g. Ido and Itai ( 1994 ) ), parsing (e.g. Burkett and Klein (2008) ; Zhao et al. (2009) ; Burkett et al. (2010) ), information retrieval (Gao et al., 2009), named entity detection (Burkett et al., 2010); topic extraction ( e.g. Zhang et a l., 2010), text classification (e.g. Amini et al., 2010), and hyponym -relation acquisition ( e.g. Oh et al., 2009). In these cases, multilingual models increase performance because different languages contain different ambiguities and therefore present comp lementary views on the shared underlying labels. Our work shares a similar motivation. We propose a maximum entropy -based statistical model. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models 1 ha ve be en widely used in many NLP task s (Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Smith, 2006 ) . The models assign the conditional probability of the label given the observation as follows: where is a real -valued vector of feature weights and is a feature function that maps pairs to a nonnegative real -valued feature vector . Each feature has an associated parameter, , which is called its weight ; and is the corresponding normalization factor. 
Maximum likelihood parameter estimation (training) for such a model, with a set of labeled examples , amounts to solving the following optimization problem : 3.1 Problem Definition Given two languages and , suppose we have two distinct (i.e. not parallel) se ts of sentiment -labeled data , and written in and respectively. In addition, we have unlabeled (w.r.t. sentiment) bilingual (in and ) parallel data that are defined as follows. where denotes the polarity of the -th instance (positive or negative) ; and are respectively the numbers of labeled instances in and ; and are parallel instances in and , respectively (i.e. they are supposed to be translations of one an other), whose labels and outlined in Section 1, should be similar.

Given the input data and , our task is to jointly learn two monolingual sentiment classifiers  X  one for and one fo r . With MaxEnt, we learn from the input data : where and are the vectors of feature weights for and , respectively (for brevity we denote them as and i n the remaining sections ) . In this study, we focus on sentence -level sentiment classification, i.e. each is a sentence, and and 3.2 The Joint Model Given the problem definition above, we now present a novel model to exploit the correspondence of parallel sentences in unlabeled bilingual text. The model maximizes the following joint likelihood with respect to and : where denotes or ; the first term on the right -hand side is the likelihood of labeled data f or both and ; and the second term is the likelihood of the unlabeled parallel data .

If we assume that parallel sentences are perfect translations, the two sentences in ea ch pair should have the same polarity label, which gives us: where is the unobserved class label for the -th instance in the unlabeled data . This probability directly models the sentiment label agreement between and .

However, there could be considerable noise in real -world parallel dat a, i.e. the sentence pairs may be noisily parallel (or even comparable) instead of fully parallel (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005). In such noisy cases, the labels (positive or negative) could be different for the two monolingual sentences in a sentence pair. Al though we do not know the exact probability that a sentence pair exhibits the same label, we can approximate it using their translation probabilities, which can be computed using word alignment toolkits such as Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) or the Berkeley wo rd aligner (Liang et al., 2006). The intuition here is that if the translation probability of two sentences is high, the probability that they have the same sentiment label should be high as well . Therefore, by considering the noise in parallel data, we ge t: where is the translation probability of the -th sentence pair in ; 2 is the opposite of ; the first term models the probability that and h ave the same label ; and the second t erm models the probability that they have different labels . 
By further considering the weight to ascribe to the unlabeled data vs. the labeled data (and the weight for the L2 -norm regularization), we get the following regularized joint log likelihood to b e maximized: where the first term on the right -hand side is the log likelihood o f the labeled data from both and unlabeled parallel data , multiplied by , a constant that controls the contribution of the unlabeled data; and is a regularization constant that pena lize s model complexity or large feature weights. When is 0, the algorithm ignores the unlabeled data and degenerates to two MaxEnt model s trained on only the labeled data . 3.3 The EM A lgorithm on MaxEnt To solve the optimization problem for the model, w e need to jointly estimate the optimal parameters for the two monolingual classifiers by finding:
This can be done with an EM algorithm, whose steps are summar ized in Algorithm 1. First, the MaxEnt parameters, and , are estimated from just the labeled data. Then, in the E -step, the classifiers, based on current values of and , compute for each labeled example and as sign probabilistically -weighted class labels to each unlabeled example. Next, in the M -step, the parameters, and , are updated using both the original labeled data ( and ) and the newly labeled data . These last two steps are ite rated until convergence or a predefined iteration limit .
In the M -step, w e can optimize the regularized joint log likelihood using any gradient -based optimization technique (Malouf, 2002). The gradient for Equation 3 based on Equation 4 is shown in Appendix A ; those for Equations 5 and 6 can be derived similarly . In our experiments, we use the L -BFGS algorithm (Liu et al., 1989) and run EM until the change in regularized joint log likelihood is less than 1e -5 or we reach 100 iterations. 3 3.4 Pseudo -Parallel Labeled and Unlabeled We also consider the case where a parallel corpus is not available: to obtain a pseudo -parallel corpus corresponding automatic translations), we use an automatic machine translation system (e.g. Google machine translation 4 ) to translate unlabeled in -domain data from to or vice versa .
 Since previous work (Banea et al., 2008; 2010; Wan, 2009) has shown that it could be useful to automatically translate the labeled data from the source language into the target language, we can further incorporate such translated labeled data into the joint model by add ing the following component into Equation 6: where is the alternative class of , is the automatically translated example from ; and translated labeled data. 4.1 Data Sets and Preprocessing The following labeled datasets are used in our experiments .
 MPQA (Labeled English Data): T he Multi -Perspe ctive Question Answering (MPQA) corpus ( Wiebe et al., 2005 ) co nsists of newswire documents manually annotated with phrase -level subjectivity information. W e extract all sentences containing strong (i.e. intensity is medium or higher), sentiment -bearing (i.e. polarity is positive or negative ) expressions following Cho i and Cardie (2008). Sentences with both positive and negative strong expressions are then discarded, and the polarity of each remaining sentence is set to that of its sentiment -bearing expression(s) . NTCIR -EN (Labeled English Data) and NTCIR -CH (Labeled C hinese Data): T he NTCIR Opinion Analysis t ask (Seki et al., 2007; 2008) provides sentiment -labeled news data in Chinese, Japanese and English. O nly those sentences with a polarity label (positive or negative) agreed to by at least two annotators are extrac ted. We use the Chinese data from NTCIR -6 as our Chinese labeled data. Since far fewer sentences in the English data pass the annotator agreement filter, we combine the English data from NTCIR -6 and NTCIR -7. The Chinese sentences are segmented using the St anford Chinese word segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005) .

The number of sentences in each of these datasets is shown in Table 1. In our experiments, we evaluate two settings of the data: ( 1) MPQA+NTCIR -CH, and ( 2) NTCIR -EN+NTCIR -CH. In each setting, the English labeled data constitutes and the Chinese labeled data, . Unlabeled Parallel Text and its Preprocessing . For the unlabeled parallel text, we use the ISI Chinese -English p arallel corpus ( Munteanu and Marcu , 2005), which was extracted automatically from news articles published by Xinhua Ne ws Agency in the Chinese Gigaword (2 nd Edition ) and English Gigaword (2 n d Edition ) collections . Because sentence pairs in the ISI corpus are quite noisy, we rely on Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to obtain a new translation probability for each sentence pair , and select the 100,000 pairs with the highest translation probabilities. 5
W e also try to remove neutral sentences from the parallel data since they can introduce noise into our model, which deals only with positive and negative examples. To do this, w e tr ain a single classifier from the combined C hinese and English labeled data for each data setting above by concatenating the or i ginal English and Chinese feature sets. We then classif y each unlabeled sentence pair by combining the two sentences in each pair into one. W e choose the most co nfidently predicted 10,000 positive and 10,000 negative pairs to constitute the unlabeled parallel corpus for each data setting. 4.2 Baseline M ethods In our experiments, the proposed joint model is compared with the following baseline methods .
MaxEnt: This method learns a MaxEnt classifier for each language given the monolingual labeled data ; the unlabeled data is not used.
SVM: This method learns an SVM classifier for each language given the monolingual labeled data ; the unlabeled data is not used. SVM -lig ht (Joachims, 1999a) is used for all the SVM -related experiments.

Monolingual TSVM (TSVM -M) : This method learns two transductive SVM (TSVM) classifiers given the monolingual labeled data and the monolingual unlabeled data for each language . 
Bilingual TSVM (TSVM -B) : This method learns one T SVM classifier given the labeled training data in two languages together with the unlabeled sentences by combining the two sentences in each unlabeled pair into one. We expect this method to perform better than TSVM -M sin ce the combined (bilingual) unlabeled sentences could be more helpful than the unlabeled monolingual sentences.

Co -Training with SVM s (Co -SVM) : This method applies SVM -based co -training given both the labeled training data and the unlabeled parallel data f ollowing Wan (2009) . First, two monolingual SVM classifiers are built based on only the corresponding labeled data, and then they are bootstrapped by adding the most confident predicted examples from the unlabeled data into the training set. We run bootstr apping for 100 iterations. In each iteration, we select the most confidently predicted 5 0 positive and 50 negative sentences from each of the two classifier s , and take the union of the resulting 2 00 sentence pairs as the newly labeled training data . ( E xamples with co nflicting labels within the pair are not included . ) In our experiments, the methods are tested in the two data settings with the corresponding unlabeled parallel corpus as mentioned in Section 4 . 6 We use 5 -fold cross -validation and rep ort average accuracy (also MicroF1 in this case) and MacroF1 scores . Unigrams are used as binary features for all models, as Pang et al. (2002) showed that binary features perform better than frequency features for sentiment classification . The weights for unlabeled data and regularization, and , are set to 1 unless otherwise stated. Later, we will show that the proposed approach perform s well with a wide range of parameter values. 7 5.1 Method Comparison W e first compare the proposed joint model ( J oint ) with the baselines in Table 2 . As s een from the table, the proposed approach outperforms all five baseline methods in terms of both accuracy and MacroF1 for both English and Chinese and in both of the data settings. 8 By making use of the unlabeled pa rallel data, our proposed approach improves the accuracy, compared to MaxEnt, by 8.12% (or 33.27% error reduction) on English and 3.44% (or 16.92% error reduction) on Chinese in the first setting, and by 5.07% (or 19.67% error reduction) on English and 3.8 7% (or 19.4% error reduction) on Chinese in the second setting.
 TSVMs do not always improve performance using the unlabeled data compared to the standalone SVM ; and TSVM -B outperforms TSVM -M except for Chinese in t he second setting . The MPQA data is more difficult in general compared to the NTCIR data. Without unlabeled parallel data, the performance on the Chinese data is better than on the English data, which is consistent with results reported in NTCIR -6 (Seki et al., 2007). 
Overall, the unlabeled parallel data improves classification accuracy for both languages when using our proposed joint model and Co -SVM . The joint model mak es better use of the unlabeled parallel data than Co -SVM or T SVMs presumably because o f its attempt to jointly optimize the two monolingual models via soft (probabilistic) assignments of the unlabeled instances to classes in each iteration, instead of the hard assignments in Co -SVM and T SVMs. Although English sentiment classification alone is more difficult than Chinese for our datasets, we obtain greater performance gains for English by exploiting unlabeled parallel data as well as the Chinese labeled data. 5.2 Varying the Weight and Amount of Fig ure 1 shows the accuracy curve of the proposed approach for the two data settings when varying the weight for the unlabeled data, , from 0 to 1. When is set to 0, the joint model degenerate s to two MaxEnt models trained with only the labeled data. 
We can see that the performance gain s for the proposed approach are quite remarkable even when in general compared to the NTCIR data, we still see steady improve ments in performance with unlabeled parallel data. Overall, the proposed approach performs quite well for a wi de range of parameter values of . 
Fig ure 2 shows the accuracy curve of the proposed approach for the two data settings when varying the amount of unlabeled data from 0 to 20,000 instances . We see that the performance of the proposed approach improve s steadily by adding more and more unlabeled data. However, even with only 2,000 unlabeled sentence pairs, the proposed approach still produces large performance gains. 5.3 Results on Pseudo -Parallel Unlabeled As discussed in Section 3. 4 , we generate pse udo -parallel data by translating the monolingual sentences in each setting using Google  X  X  machine translation system . Fig ures 3 and 4 show the performance of our model using the ps e udo -parallel data versus the real parallel data, in the two settings, respe ctively. The EN -&gt;CH pseudo -parallel data consists of the English unlabeled data and its automatic Chinese translation , and vice versa.

Although not as significant as those with parallel data, we can still obtain improvement s using the pseudo -parallel data, especially in the first setting . T he difference between using parallel versus pseudo -parallel data is around 2 -4% in Fig ures 3 and 4 , which is reasonable s ince the quality of the pseudo -parallel data is not as good as that of the parallel data . Therefore, the performance using pseudo -parallel data is better with a small weight ( e.g. = 0.1) in some cases. 5.4 Adding Pseudo -Parallel Labeled Data In this section , we investigate how adding automatically translated labeled data might influence the performan ce as mentioned in Section 3. 4 . We use only the translated labeled data to train classifiers, and then directly classify the test data. The average accuracies in setting 1 are 66.6 1% and 63.11 % on English and Chinese, respectively ; while the accuracies in setting 2 are 58.43 % and 54.07 % on English and Chinese, respectively . This result is reasonable because of the language gap between the origi nal language and the translated language. In addition, the class distributions of the English labeled data and the Chinese are quite different (30% vs. 55% for positive as shown in Table 1 ). 
Fig ures 5 and 6 show the accuracies when vary ing the weight of the translated labeled data vs. the labeled data , with and without the unlabeled parallel data . From Fig ure 5 for se tting 1 , we can see that the translated data can be helpful given the labeled data and even the unlabeled data, as long as decrease s the performance in most cases for setting 2 . One possible reason is that in the first data setting, the NTCIR English data cover s the same topics as the NTCIR Chinese data and thus direct tra nslation is helpful, while the English and Chinese topics are quite different in the second data setting, and thus direct translation hurt s the performance given the existing labeled data in each language. 5.5 Discussion To further understand what contribut ion s our proposed approach makes to the performance gain , we look inside the parameters in the MaxEnt models learned before and after adding the parallel unlabeled data. Table 3 shows the features in the model learned from the labeled data that have the large st weight change after adding the parallel data ; and Table 4 shows the newly learned features from the unlabeled data with the largest weights .
From Table 3 10 we can see that the weight changes of the original features are quite reasonable, e.g. the top words in th e positive class are obviously positive and the proposed approach gives them higher weights. The new features also seem reasonable given the knowledge that the labeled and unlabeled data includes negative news about for specific topics ( e. g. G ermany, T aiwa n ), .
We also examine the process of joint training by check ing the performance on test data and the agreement of the two monolingual models on the unlabeled parallel data in both setting s . The average agreement across 5 folds is 85.06% and 73.87% in settin g s 1 and 2 , respectively , before the joint training, and increase s to 100% and 99.89% , respectively , after 100 iterations of joint training . Although the average agreement has already increased to 99.50% and 99.02% in setting s 1 and 2 , respectively , after 30 iterations, the performance on the test set steadily improv es in both settings until around 50 -60 iterations , and then become s relatively stable after that .

Examination of t hose sentence pairs in setting 2 for which the two monolingual models still disa gree after 100 iterations of joint training often produces sentences that are not quite parallel , e.g. :
Since the two sentences discuss human right s from very different perspectives, it is reasonable that the two monolingual models will classify them with different polarities (i.e. positive for the English sentence and negative for the Chinese sentence) even after joint training . In this paper, we study bi lin gual sentiment classification and propose a joint model to simultaneously learn better monolingual sentiment classifiers for each language by exploiting an unlabeled parallel corpus together with the labeled data available for each language. Our experiment s show that the proposed approach can si gnificantly improve sentiment classification for both languages . Moreover, the proposed approach continues to produce (albeit smaller) performance gains when employing pseudo -parallel data from machine translation en gines.

In future work, we would like to apply the joint learning idea to other learning frameworks ( e.g. SVM s ) , and to extend the proposed model to handle word -level parallel information, e.g. bilingual dictionaries or word alignment information . Another i ssue is to investigate how to improve multilingual sentiment analysis by exploiting comparable corpora.
