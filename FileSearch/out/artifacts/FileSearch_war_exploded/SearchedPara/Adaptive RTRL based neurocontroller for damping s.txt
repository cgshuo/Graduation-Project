 1. Introduction
The recent advances in power electronics have led to the development of reliable and high speed flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices. Thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) is such a FACTS device which can compensate transmission line reactance and control power flow through the transmission system. The influence of conventional fixed series capacitor can cause growing subsynchronous oscillations between the electrical system and turbine-generators due to electrical resonance.
The phenomenon of SSR was brought to the general attention in connection with the two damages that occurred to the turbine  X  generator shafts at the Mohave Generating station in southern Nevada in the United States of America in December of 1970 and
October of 1971. These two failures were analysed and found that the failures occurred in the shaft section between the generator and the exciter of the main generator collector was due to torsional fatigue ( IEEE Committee Report, 1985; IEEE, 1992;
Anderson et al., 1990 ). Torsional problems are most frequently encountered in rotor systems with long shafts and large inertias constituting a weakly damped mechanical system. Different methods of mitigating SSR are available in literature ( Hingorani, 1981; Walker et al., 1981; IEEE SSR Working Group, 1982 ). reactance can improve the overall system performance of the series compensated systems ( Padiyar, 1998; Ballance and Gold-determine its appropriate control strategy, accurate models of TCSC are needed. Since the TCSC incorporates both continuous dynamics like capacitor voltage and discrete conditions like thyristor triggering, its modeling and analysis are complicated.
Attempts have been made in the past to obtain linearised time invariant continuous models or discrete sample invariant models suitable for eigenanalysis. A discrete linear time invariant analytical model based on Poincare mapping method is developed by Othman and Angquist (1996) . The frequency range of this model is twice the system frequency. It incorporates thyristor triggering logic, synchronisation system and higher level control loop. A detailed derivation of the closed form TCSC dynamic model is presented in Rajaraman and Dobson X  X  (1996) paper. In this, the steady state solution of the TCSC compensated network can be approximated by nominal quantities in the DQ reference frame. This can be applied to a system where the TCSC forms a relatively small proportion of the total series compensation which is the normal case of an existing TCSC line. The drawback of this method is that it cannot be used for systems with larger proportion of the compensation provided by TCSC. In this case there will be strong harmonic interactions between the TCSC and the network. Jalali and Hedin (1996) developed a dynamic TCSC model based on Poincare mapping technique with sampling time both generator and TCSC. Kabiri et al. (2005) developed a discrete state space model of TCSC compensated system. They have discretised the system with sampling frequency six times that of the system frequency. Cheriyan and Kulkarni (2009) developed a linearised discrete-time model of a pre-firing NGH damper for damping SSR oscillations. A modular discrete model of TCSC with high bandwidth is developed by Joshi et al. (2009) . The time invariance of this model is made by the transformation of zero sequence components. Six samples per cycle is selected. This methodology is adopted in the present work.

Most of the controllers designed for the oscillation damping are based on a linearised model of the system in which the system is linearised about an operating point to give good performance. Since the electrical power system is highly non-linear with configurations and parameters that change with time, the conventional controller based on the linearised model cannot guarantee its performance in a practical operating environment. Moreover, the performance of these linear controllers will deteriorate with a wide variation of operating condition and in the presence of large disturbance. To accommodate the changes in the operating conditions, periodical retuning of the controller is needed to maintain the desired performance. Design of a linear or non-linear controller requires an accurate mathematical model of the system, which is practically difficult. Recently, various adaptive control techniques have been proposed for dealing with large parameter variations. Basically, adaptive control systems can be classified into two categories, namely the self-tuning regulators and the model reference control systems. The self-tuning regulator is based on explicit identification of the system transfer function has the difficulty of designing an efficient on-line identifier whereas, for the model reference control the requirement of satisfying the perfect model following conditions applied to power system in the sense of practical implementation. In adaptive control methods, the model parameters are updated periodically to represent the actual system. But this control technique requires a good knowledge about the process, which requires an accurate mathematical modeling of the system which is very difficult.

Hence an intelligent controller with adaptive learning cap-abilities in the presence of unknown disturbances, unmodeled dynamics and unstructured uncertainties is required to replace the conventional controllers. Artificial neural network can be an intelligent controller to control non-linear, dynamic systems through learning. The variation of plant parameters and plant structures can be effectively updated in the neural network based control strategy and hence the robustness of the control system is improved. Since the accuracy in the plant modeling or the explicit parameter identification is not significant in the proposed map non-linear functions, generalisation capabilities and fast response makes it attractive for control applications ( Ender and Maciel Filho, 2000 ; Al-Zohary et al., 2002 ; Semino and Pannocchia, 1999 ).

In all the reported works, a fully connected recurrent neural network (RNN) is seldom used for the control of subsynchronous oscillations. In this paper, a new adaptive neurocontroller is proposed for the damping of subsynchronous resonance oscilla-the network architecture, i.e., the number and type of neurons, the location of feedback loops and the development of a suitable training algorithm. Most of the training techniques available for neural network ( Linkens and Nyongesa, 1996 ; Narendra and Parthasarathy, 1990; Jin et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1992; Stephen and Pich, 1994 ) are unable to retain the informations about the infinite past which is essential for the real-time applications. A dynamic recurrent neuron with a feedback connection from output to input is the suitable architecture for the real-time learning. Different training methods are available for recurrent neurons ( Pearlmutter, 1995; Williams and Zipser, 1989 ). Sindhu et al. designed a neurocontroller trained by RTRL algorithm ( Sindhu Thampatty et al., 2009 ) which is used for the control of single-input single-output systems (SISO). In this work, the proposed neurocontroller architecture is suitable for any type of non-linear systems which can be trained by RTRL algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed controller can be designed by using a reduced plant model to simplify the controller design without degrading much the performance. It follows that the proposed is concerned. The system we considered in this study is a single-input multi-output (SIMO) system. RTRL algorithm is an optimal algorithm which minimises the instantaneous squared error at the output of RNN for every discrete time instants, while the network is running. Number of neurons in the output layer of RNN is equal to the number of states of the system and the number of neurons in the controller network must be same as the number of control inputs.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly explains the subsynchronous phenomenon and Section 3 explains the math-ematical modeling of modular time-invariant discrete model of TCSC. Section 4 explains the interconnection of the modular TCSC with the rest of the system in IEEE first benchmark model. Section 5 discusses the detailed design of the proposed adaptive neurocontroller. Simulation results are discussed in Section 6 followed by conclusion in Section 7. 2. Subsynchronous resonance phenomenon
Subsynchronous resonance (SSR) is a dynamic phenomenon in electric power system condition where the electric network exchanges energy with a turbine generator at one or more of the natural frequencies of the combined system below the synchronous frequency X  X . In a series compensated network shown electrical disturbance, where f er is given by f  X  f where X C is the effective series capacitive reactance, X of the transmission network and X SYS is the system reactance.
These currents appearing at the generator armature will produce a rotating magnetic field at an angular electrical speed of o er . The armature magnetic field rotating at subsynchronous speed interacts with the rotor magnetic field and develops an electromagnetic torque. The component of this subsynchronous torque which is in phase with the speed deviation is responsible for the sustained oscillations in the system ( Kundur, 1994 ).
When the subsynchronous torque frequency f 0 f er is close to one of the torsional mode frequencies f n , the system experiences torsional interaction. The normal subsynchronous frequency range is between 10 and 50Hz whereas the swing mode frequency is between 0.7 and 2Hz. If the damping torque component of the subsynchronous torque equals or exceeds the inherent damping torque of the rotating system, the corresponding torsional modes will be unstable. If the generator torsional mode frequencies are different from the subsynchronous frequency, then the torsional the complement of a torsional resonant frequency of the turbine-generator shaft system, the torsional interaction takes place nous current. The problem of torsional interaction is more severe than that due to induction generator effect. 3. Linear time invariant (LTI) discrete model of TCSC
The main circuit of TCSC includes a capacitor, inductor and an antiparallel switching thyristors. The operation of TCSC is periodic, where one of the thyristor conducts during a portion of the half cycle. The duration and timing of the conduction is based on the triggering logic and is controlled by the current synchronised signals generated by the phase locked loop (PLL).
The assumptions made in the development of discrete model are: 1. The thyristors are assumed to be ideal. 2. TCSC is operated in capacitive mode only and the conduction angle of thyristors are limited to 60 electrical degrees which is the common operating range of TCSC. 3. The six sampling instants in a cycle are fixed in time and are chosen such that the conduction period of intervals are as shown in Fig. 2 . 4. The line current in DQ0 reference frame varies linearly during the sampling interval, i.e., i where h  X  p 3 o The conversion used to transfer three phase abc variables to
DQ0 is given by f f f 2 6 4 3 7 5  X  T where T is the transformation matrix given by T  X 
The conduction period of the thyristor in any one phase is shown in Fig. 2 . During the conduction interval of the thyristor, the TCSC is modeled as a parallel LC circuit and the corresponding differential equation in DQ0 reference frame for phase  X  X  X  can be written as dV dt  X  di dt  X  When the thyristors are turned off, the inductor currents are zero and hence TCSC is modeled as a simple series capacitor circuit. Then the corresponding voltage equation for phase  X  X  X  can be written as dV dt  X  The state-space representation of phase a is _ x  X  Ax a  X  B a I DQ 0  X  9  X  _ y  X  PB a I DQ 0  X  10  X  where x  X  A  X  Similar equations can be written for phases  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  with 120 and 240 1 phase shift: _ x  X  Ax b  X  B b I dq 0  X  11  X  _ x  X  Ax c  X  B c I dq 0  X  12  X  where x  X  x  X 
The thyristor turn on instant is f a and turn off instant is t in phases  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  can be written as f b , t b and f c The calculations of capacitor voltages at different instants for different phases are given in Cheriyan and Kulkarni (2009) .
To derive TCSC model in state space form, a change in current firing angle at k th sample are taken as the three inputs to the model. Then the TCSC model in state space form can be written as D V a  X  t 1  X  D V b  X  t 1  X 
D V c  X  t 1  X  2 6 4 voltages and DQ0 currents in the previous sample on the present sample. The coefficient matrices of Eq. (13) can be calculated as F u  X  G u where f  X  cos o n s , o n  X  h  X  o n sin  X  o n s  X  V b  X  f b  X  , J b  X  0.

D f b and D t b are the change in thyristor turn on and turn off G matrices, it is found that the variation in capacitor voltage in any phase is independent of the turn off time of the respective thyristor. In this model formulation, the change in current during any sampling interval is a function of time and it is linearly varying during sampling interval. This change in current can be written as D I The matrix equation of discrete LTI TCSC model in DQ0 reference frame after the transformation is given by D V D  X  k  X  1  X  D V Q  X  k  X  1  X 
D V 0  X  k  X  1  X  2 6 4 where F k  X  T 1  X  t 1  X  F u k T  X  t 0  X  , G 1 k  X  T 1  X  t H  X  T 1  X  t 1  X  H u k .

The time varying transformation matrix T is evaluated at are not sample invariant, i.e., for any sample, the matrix at k th sign of all coupling terms between zero sequence variables and DQ variables in the F, G matrices and the last row of H matrix of TCSC, to make the model sample invariant, a sample invariant transformation is applied to the zero sequence variables as I  X  k  X  X  X  1  X  k I z  X  k  X  X  17  X  V  X  k  X  X  X  1  X  k V z  X  k  X  X  18  X  where k indicates any sample. After the above transformation, the sample invariant TCSC equations can be obtained as D V D  X  k  X  1  X  D V Q  X  k  X  1  X 
D V z  X  k  X  1  X  2 6 4
It is found that the sample invariant transformation is consistent and the transformed zero sequence components retain their coupling to D and Q components of currents and voltages.
When the developed TCSC model is interfaced with the rest of the power system, the discretised zero sequence variables of the system also to be transformed to obtain the time invariance. 4. Model of the rest of the system
The rest of the system consists of turbine-generator system, transmission line, PLL and TCSC controller. TCSC voltage V the input for the rest of the system. 4.1. Turbine-generator model
The system considered here is the IEEE first benchmark model which has totally six masses including the generator and exciter.
Following assumptions are made in the derivation of the basic electrical equations of the machine:
The mmf in the air gap is distributed sinusoidally and the harmonics are neglected.
 neglected.
 Magnetic saturation and hysteresis are ignored.

The mechanical system consisting of rotors of generator, exciter, turbines amd shafts can be viewed as a mass X  X pring damper system. Assumptions made in the modeling of mechanical systems are: The system masses are considered as lumped masses.
 Slip at the operating point is zero.

Assuming the fluxes linking with different rotor coils are free of harmonics, the time invariant linearised model about an equilibrium point can be written as D _ x  X  A G D x G  X  B G D U G  X  20  X  D y  X  C G D x G  X  21  X  and 12 mechanical state variables. The input D U G contains the D and Q components of the generator terminal voltage given by D U  X  X  D V D D V Q  X  22  X  D y  X  X  D I D D I Q  X  23  X  where D I D and D I Q represents the D and Q components of generator current injection. 4.2. Electrical network model
Electrical AC network consists of transformers and transmis-sion lines with fixed series compensation. Transformers are modeled by representing its equivalent leakage reactance and the transmission lines are represented by its equivalent impe-dance as shown in Fig. 1 . The state space representation of the electrical network is represented as D _ x  X  A N D x N  X  B N D V DQ 0  X  24  X  D I where D V 4.3. Current synchronised PLL
A current synchronised PLL is designed for setting the TCSC the previous zero crossing of the line current. The timing signal space equation of PLL can be expressed as D _ x
D y where x PLL is the PLL state matrix. 4.4. Conventional TCSC controller model
The conventional TCSC controller controls the firing angle a of the thyristor to damp the oscillations. These controllers are specifically for damping SSR. In this study, the output of the mechanical system is slip and it is given as the input to respond to this change in the mechanical torque or disturbance
Fig. 4 . This design is based on the damping torque analysis. The conventional controller consists of a gain block, a signal washout block and a phase compensation block as shown in Fig. 5 . The phase compensation block provides the appropriate phase lead = tan iD  X  characteristics to compensate for the phase lag between input and output signals. The signal washout block serves as a high pass filter which allows signals associated with oscillations in input signal to pass unchanged. The general form of controller equation is given by D _ x C  X  A C D x C  X  B C D a  X  C C D x C  X  D C 4.5. Interfaced discrete-time model of the system
Combining the discretised equations of generator-motor, transmission network and the PLL with the discrete model of TCSC, the overall system equation can be written as D x where D x sys represent the discrete state variables of the full system. Assume that the V DQ 0 varies linearly within a sampling interval. The discrete time system eigenvalues l d of the system are converted to its equivalent continuous-time eigenvalues l l  X  where h is the sampling time.

Result of the eigenanalysis conducted on the system with the conventional controller is shown in Table 1 . The triggering angle (p.u) and voltage V  X  1 per unit (p.u).

Per-unit is the representation of system quantities as fractions voltage, current, impedance, and admittance based on a common base which will make the calculations simple in electrical systems.

As shown in Table 1 , when the gain of the conventional controller increases, the swing mode and some of the torsional mode gets stabilised or the damping is improved. But torsional mode 4 gets destabilised. Hence it is observed that the simultaneous damping of all modes using the conventional controller is difficult.

Conventionally, it is difficult to design a single controller to damp swing mode as well as all the torsional modes simulta-neously. It may be desirable to have a separate power swing damping controller (PSDC) and subsynchronous damping con-troller (SSDC). DLQG is an optimal controller, the main objective of which is to determine the control signals that will cause a system (plant) to satisfy some physical constraints and at the same time extremize (maximise or minimise) a chosen perfor-mance criterion (performance index or cost function). DLQG design is an optimal control design which produces the best possible control system for a given set of performance objectives. Usually a quadratic cost function known as performance index of the system states and control signal must be minimised by feeding back the optimal states. In most of the practical systems, all the system state variables are not available for the measure-ment. Hence it is necessary to use an optimal estimator for state estimation. In this work the design of DLQG involves the design of Kalman filter as an optimal estimator, and the estimated states are fed back to the system as a state feedback control.
As the operating condition changes, these controllers have to be retuned to maintain the desired performance, which is practically difficult. Hence an intelligent controller which can effectively deal with uncertainties or unknown variations in plant parameters or operating conditions and hence improving the robustness of the control system is necessary. Hence our interest simultaneous damping of torsional mode as well as the swing mode oscillations in the IEEE first benchmark system. The architecture and design of the proposed controller is explained in detail in the next section. 5. Proposed neurocontroller
An adaptive neurocontroller is proposed for controlling the firing angle of TCSC to damp subsynchronous oscillations. In the network is a recurrent neural network (RNN) which is a fully connected architecture with all the system outputs fed back to the input through a delay. This network tracks the dynamic properties of the system. The second neural network functions as a controller which provides the necessary control signal to the plant. A set of feedback weights  X  w  X  controls the amount of feedback to each processing neuron in the RNN and a set of weights  X  wu  X  controls the amount of control input generated by the controller neuron. The proposed control strategy is represented in Fig. 6 . The complete block diagram of the proposed neurocontroller along time recurrent learning (RTRL) algorithm, which is the most sophisticated real-time neural network algorithm. The system states are modified while training the neural network and the Training algorithm of the neural network is explained in detail in the next section. 5.1. Recurrent learning algorithm for RNN
Recurrent neural network (RNN) is a suitable architecture for the real-time applications. Fig. 8 shows the layout and Fig. 9 shows the structure of a fully connected RNN with system states, control inputs and bias input.

In a fully connected RNN, all outputs are fed back to the source of computational nodes. The RTRL algorithm used for training the neural network is a forward gradient algorithm, which uses a matrix of partial derivative of the network states with respect to every weight ( Sindhu Thampatty et al., 2009 ).

The algorithm is based on minimising the instantaneous squared error at the output neurons of the RNN, when a desired trajectory is supplied to the output neurons. The main difficulty related to the recursive training of the recurrent network arises derivatives with respect to the weights depend on the inputs. In this method, partial derivatives of each node with respect to each weight are computed at every iteration ( Haykin, 1994 ) and hence as the number of input increases, computing time also increases.
The training results and the speed of response will depend on the following factors: 1. Network architecture (number of feedback connections). 2. Initialisation of the system states and the number of states. 3. Initialisation of the weight matrix. 4. The learning rate constant Z .

If q is the number of states of the system and m is the number of control inputs to the system, then the dynamic system can be
Linear represented by the non-linear difference equations given in x  X  n  X  1  X  X  F  X  W a x  X  n  X  X  W b u  X  n  X  X  X  32  X  F is the activation function used in RNN: y  X  n  X  X  Cx  X  n  X  X  33  X  where W a is a q q matrix, W b is a q ( m +1) matrix and C is a p q matrix. Let c : R q -R q is a non-linear map. The neural network with m inputs, p outputs and q states can be represented in state space form as given in x  X  n  X  1  X  X  W  X  z  X  n  X  X  The matrices, W a , W b , C and the non-linear function f are interpreted as follows:
In (32), the total weights are split into two, namely, W a
The matrix W a represents the synaptic weights associated with q neurons in the hidden layer that are fed back as inputs in the input layer. The matrix W b represents the synaptic weights associated with this hidden layer, which are connected to the input sources including the bias. Thus, the bias terms of the hidden neurons are included in W b . The matrix C represents the synaptic weights of p output neurons connected to the hidden layers.

The neurons in the hidden layers are with hyperbolic tangent non-linear function, given by f  X  x  X  X  1 e 2 x 1  X  e 2 x  X  37  X  or a logistic function: f  X  x  X  X  1 1  X  e x  X  38  X 
The network consists of a set of N fully connected neurons and activations in the network. Based on standard RTRL terminology, the output of node  X  k  X  at time ( n +1) is to be calculated as y  X  n  X  1  X  X  f k  X  S k  X  n  X  X  X  39  X  where S  X  n  X  X  Z  X  n  X  X  x k  X  n  X  , k A My k  X  n  X  , k A N  X  41  X  The non-linear activation function f ( ) maps to the range [0,1]. J ( n ) represented as J  X  n  X  X  1 2
To execute the RTRL algorithm, three matrices 4 j  X  n  X  , [ f  X  n  X  are calculated which are explained in (43), (44) and (46). of the state vector with respect to the weight vector: 4 j  X  n  X  X  @ X  X  n  X  [ j  X  n  X  X  partial derivatives of the non-linear activation function given by f  X  w T j  X  z  X  n  X  X  , j  X  1 , 2 , ... , q  X  45  X  Proceeding through the steps of least mean square (LMS) algorithm using steepest descent method, the correction in the synaptic weights can be calculated as 4 e  X  n  X  X  d  X  n  X  Cx  X  n  X  X  48  X  instant. The correction in weight is given by D W j  X  n  X  X  Z C 4 j  X  n  X  e  X  n  X  X  49  X  The system states at ( n +1)th instant can be calculated as x  X  n  X  1  X  X  f  X  X  W a x  X  n  X  X  W b K  X  X  50  X  where K  X  [ bias ; control inputs ] T
The output of the RNN at ( n +1)th instant is given by y  X  n  X  1  X  X  Cx  X  n  X  1  X  X  51  X 
Thus, the RTRL algorithm can be summarised as follows: 1. Initialise the weights: Wj  X  X  W aj W particular operating condition. 3. Set 4 j  X  n  X  X  0 for j  X  1,2, y , q 4. Compute for n  X  0 ,1, y 4 e  X  n  X  X  d  X  n  X  Cx  X  n  X  D W j  X  n  X  X  Z C 4 j  X  n  X  e  X  n  X 
By identifying the partial derivatives of the output function can be denoted as given in p  X  n  X  1  X  X  @  X  y k  X  n  X  1  X  X  @  X  W where y  X  X  C x  X  X  D u  X  53  X 
In this algorithm, the storage requirements cannot be reduced as they constitute a crucial component in the weight upgradation procedure. In each execution of the RTRL algorithm, the states of given as the input to RNN and the desired output is supplied to the RNN for training. The controller neural network generates the the control input generated by the controller neuron is modified in such a way that the instantaneous squared error at the output of RNN is minimised. 5.2. Design of the controller neural network
The proposed controller has been designed using the updated states of the system as the inputs which is fed back from the output of the RNN through a delay.

Thenumberofneuronsintheproposedcontrollermustbeequal to the number of control inputs of the system and each neuron in the controller is activated by a linear activation function. The controller neural network is a single-layer network. The learning algorithm cause the adjustment of the synaptic weights of the
The control strategy at any instant of time can be written as u  X  n  X  1  X  X  s where wu ij is the synaptic weight associated with i th controller neuron. The control strategy is based on the instantaneous output generatedbyRNNwhichisgivenby y  X  n  X  1  X  X  f  X  y  X  n  X  , u  X  n  X  , bias  X  X  55  X  [ u neural network
When the desired output trajectory is given at any instant, say ( n +1)th instant, then the required control input is generated by the controller with the available knowledge of the states in n th instant. For the purpose of training the network, the desired trajectory can be obtained by any method.

The controller generates an appropriate control to achieve the RTRL algorithm. The neurocontroller output is given to the thyristors of TCSC. The proposed controller is given in Fig. 10 . Each controller neuron is connected to all the states in the input layer and also connected to an external bias. 6. Simulation results
IEEE first benchmark model (FBM) for SSR is used for the case study presented here ( IEEE, 1977 ). This series compensated system has five torsional modes. The series compensation of the system is made partly by a fixed capacitor ( X FC  X  0.15p.u) and partly by TCSC. The discrete time-invariant model of TCSC as discussed in Section 3 is used in this study. Mechanical damping of the system is assumed to be zero in the analysis, to present worst damping conditions. The stability of the system with two linearised controllers namely, the conventional controller and DLQG (optimal controller) is analysed using eigenvalue analysis. Table 1 gives the eigenvalues of the system with a conventional controller. All the analysis are made with an operating condition of P  X  1p.u, V  X  1p.u and a  X  170 3 . 6.1. SSR analysis with TCSC for fixed firing angles (without any controller)
FBM with TCSC is modeled for fixed firing angles and then conducted eigenvalue analysis for different operating conditions. 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 1 10 2 10 3
Table 2 shows the eigenvalues of the system for different firing the swing mode is stable, but some of the torsional modes are not stable without any controller. The most negatively damped mode is torsional mode 4 because of the network mode (corresponding to frequency 219.58rad). As the firing angle increases, the damping of the torsional mode decreases. 6.2. Eigenvalue analysis with different linear controllers
The stability of the system is analysed with two different linear controllers: (1) a conventional controller and (2) discrete linear quadratic Gaussian (DLQG) controller. As mentioned in Section 4.5, the simultaneous damping of all torsional modes and swing mode is difficult with conventional controllers. Comparison is t (sec) made in different operating conditions. From Table 3 ,itis observed that without any controller, except torsional mode 1, all other modes are unstable. When a conventional controller is connected and tuned it to stabilise the swing mode, torsional mode 4 becomes unstable where as all other modes get stabilised. With DLQG, by properly tuning the measurement noise and process noise matrices, all the torsional modes as well as the swing mode oscillations are stabilised. Retuning of DLQG is required for any change in the operating point. For some 6.3. Response of the system with proposed neurocontroller
Since the response time of the proposed controller is propor-tional to the number of system states, to get a fast response, the t (sec) t (sec) order of the system can be reduced in such a way that it does not affect the dominant system dynamics. The system we modeled in this study is having 27 states. To execute RTRL algorithm, 27 states must be given as the input to RNN. In this work, by maintaining the significant dynamics, the order of the system is reduced to 11th which gives a fast response. The order reduction is done with standard model order reduction techniques. Four different methods of order reduction are tried in the system namely, balanced realisation technique, optimal Hankel norm approximation technique, truncated balanced realisation and truncated residualisation technique. The comparisons of different techniques are shown in Fig. 11 , and it is observed that the performance obtained with the optimal Hankel norm approximation technique is closer to the original system for the subsynchronous range of frequencies and hence this method is adopted in this work to reduce the system response. For the reduced 11th order system, expanded view is shown in Fig. 13 .

The output generated by the controller in each instant is output for the next immediate instant. The operating point of the initial change of 40% increase in the shaft torque between turbine section LPA and LPB. The learning rate parameter Z was taken as 0.3 for the neural network which was found to provide fast convergence. The maximum tolerance level set for the error is 0.0005. Initially the synaptic weights associated with each neuron is generated randomly for each sample. The non-linear activation neurons in RNN and the controller neurons respectively. The initial states to the neurons are set to a small value.
Fig. 14 shows the deviation of generator slip and Fig. 15 shows the deviation of torque angle delta with the controller, which t (sec) t (sec) t (sec) indicate the fast response of the system with the proposed controller. Deviation of slip in different masses are shown in
Figs. 16 X 19 . The torque deviation in different shaft sections are shown in Figs. 20 X 23 . From these figure it can be observed that the maximum peak torque will be experienced in shaft section between LPA and LPB which will persist only for few cycles mode 3 is mostly damped in the case of a torque change between LPA and LPB. Figs. 24 and 25 show the change in the D -axis and
Q -axis voltage across TCSC. Flux linkage in D -axis is shown in Fig. 26 and the squared error plot of each sample is shown in swing mode frequencies are stabilised with the proposed controller. Performance of the neurocontrollers is tested with different operating conditions. The accurate modeling of the the control of non-linear MIMO systems.

The simulation result shows that the proposed controller performs satisfactorily under different operating conditions and proved its high robustness. Also the simultaneous damping of torsional oscillations as well as the swing mode oscillations are possible with the proposed controller which is difficult with a conventional controller. The fast response of the neurocontroller makes it suitable for real-time applications. 7. Conclusion
The neural network based subsynchronous damping controller has been developed for the control of TCSC in a series compensated electrical power system. The proposed damping controller consists of a fully connected recurrent neural network architecture to model the system dynamics and a single layer neurocontroller to generate the necessary control signals for the thyristors in TCSC. The neural network is trained using real time recurrent learning algorithm (RTRL) which is a sophisticated control algorithm for the real-time applications. From the simulation results obtained on the IEEE first benchmark system, it can be observed that the proposed neurocontroller provides better damping for subsynchronous oscillations as well as the swing mode oscillations simultaneously for any operating condi-tions. This is not possible with a conventional or optimal controller. This artificial intelligent technique does not require an accurate modeling of the system and hence this controller is suitable for the non-linear system control. Moreover the fast response of the controller makes the ANN based approach very attractive for on-line applications in non-linear system control. References t (sec)
