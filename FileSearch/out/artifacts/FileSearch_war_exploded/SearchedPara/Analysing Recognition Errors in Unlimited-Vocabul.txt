 Large vocabulary speech recognizers have become very complex. Understanding how the parts of the system affect the results separately or together is far from trivial. Still, analyzing the recognition errors may suggest how to reduce the errors further.
There exist previous work on analyzing recogni-tion errors. Chase (1997) developed error region analysis (ERA), which reveals whether the errors are due to acoustic or language models. Greenberg et al. (2000) analyzed errors made by eight recog-nition systems on the Switchboard corpus. The er-rors correlated with the phone misclassification and speech rate, and conclusion was that the acoustic front ends should be improved further. Duta et al. (2006) analyzed the main errors made by the 2004 BBN speech recognition system. They showed that errors typically occur in clusters and differ between broadcast news (BN) and conversational telephone speech (CTS) domains. Named entities were a com-mon cause for errors in the BN domain, and hesita-tion, repeats and partially spoken words in the CTS domain.

This paper analyzes the errors made by a Finnish morph-based continuous recognition system (Hir-sim  X  aki et al., 2009). In addition to partitioning the errors using ERA, we compare the number of let-ter errors in different regions and analyze what kind of errors are corrected when speaker adaptive train-ing and discriminative training are taken in use. The most potential error sources are also studied by par-titioning the errors according to manual error classes and word frequencies. The language model training data used in the experi-ments consist of 150 million words from the Finnish Kielipankki corpus. Before training the n-gram models, the words of the training data were split into morphs using the Morfessor algorithm, which has been shown to improve Finnish speech recogni-tion (Hirsim  X  aki et al., 2006). The resulting morph lexicon contains 50 000 distinct morphs. A growing algorithm (Siivola et al., 2007) was used for training a Kneser-Ney smoothed high-order variable-length n-gram model containing 52 million n-grams. The acoustic phoneme models were trained on the Finnish SpeechDat telephone speech database: 39 hours from 3838 speakers for training, 46 minutes from 79 speakers for development and another simi-lar set for evaluation. Only full sentences were used and sentences with severe noise or mispronuncia-tions were removed.
The acoustic front-end consist of 39-dimensional feature vectors (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients with first and second time-derivatives), global max-imum likelihood linear transform, decision-tree tied HMM triphones with Gaussian mixture models, and cepstral mean subtraction.

Three models are trained: The first one is a max-imum likelihood (ML) model without any adap-tation. The second model (ML+SAT) enhances the ML model with three iterations of speaker adaptive training (SAT) using constrained maxi-mum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) (Gales, 1998). In recognition, unsupervised adaptation is applied in the second pass. The third model (ML+SAT+MPFE) adds four iterations of discrim-inative training with minimum phone frame error (MPFE) criterion (Zheng and Stolcke, 2005) to the ML+SAT model. 3.1 Error Region Analysis Error Region Analysis (Chase, 1997) can be used to find out whether the language model (LM), the acoustic model (AM) or both can be blamed for an erroneous region in the recognition output. Fig-ure 1 illustrates the procedure. For each utter-ance, the final hypothesis is compared to the forced alignment of the reference transcript and segmented into correct and error regions. An error region is a contiguous sequence of morphs that differ from the corresponding reference morphs with respect to morph identity, boundary time-stamps, AM score, LM score, or n-gram history 1 .

By comparing the AM and LM scores in the hy-pothesis and reference regions, the regions can be divided in classes. We denote the recognition hy-pothesis as HYP, and the reference transcript as REF. The relevant classes for the analysis are the follow-ing. REF-TOT: the reference would have better to-tal score, but it has been erroneously pruned. HYP-AM: the hypothesis has better score, but only AM favors HYP over REF. HYP-LM: the hypothesis has better score, but only LM favors HYP over REF. HYP-BOTH: both the AM and LM favor HYP.

Since the error regions are independent, the let-ter error rate 2 (LER) can be computed separately for each region. Table 1 shows the error rates for three different acoustic models: ML training, ML+SAT, and ML+SAT+MPFE. We see that SAT decreases all error types, but the biggest reduction is in the HYP-AM class. This should be expected. In the ML case, the Gaussian mixtures contain much variance due to different unnormalized speakers, and since the test set contains only unseen speakers, many errors are expected for some speakers. Adapting the models to the test set is expected to increase the acoustic score of the reference transcript, and since in the HYP-AM regions the LM already prefers REF, corrections be-cause of SAT are most probable there.

On the other hand, adding MPFE after SAT seems to reduce HYP-BOTH and HYP-LM errors, but not HYP-AM errors. The number of search errors (REF-TOT) also decreases.
 All in all, for all models, there seems to be more HYP-AM errors than HYP-LM errors. Chase (1997) lists the following possible reasons for the HYP-AM regions: noise, speaker pronounces badly, pro-nunciation model is poor, some phoneme models not trained to discriminate, or reference is plainly wrong. The next section studies these issues further. 3.2 Manual Error Classification Next, the letter errors in the error regions were manually classified according to the most probable cause. Table 2 shows the classes, the total number of letter errors for each class, and the errors divided to different error region types.

All errors that did not seem to have an obvious cause are put under the class Other . Some of the er-rors were a bit surprising, since the quality of the audio and language seemed perfectly normal, but still the recognizer got the sentences wrong. On the other hand, the class also contains regions where the speech is very fast or the signal level is quite low.
The largest class with a specific cause is Foreign , which contains about 8 % of all letter errors. Cur-rently, the morph based recognizer does not have any foreign pronunciation modeling, so it is natural that words like Ching, Yem Yung, Villeneuve, Schu-macher, Direct TV, Thunderbayssa are not recog-nized correctly, since the mapping between the writ-ten form and pronunciation does not follow the nor-mal Finnish convention. In Table 2 we see, that the acoustic model prefers the incorrect hypothesis in al-most all cases. A better pronunciation model would be essential to improve the recognition. However, integrating exceptions in pronunciation to morph-based recognition is not completely straightforward. Another difficulty with foreign names is that they are often rare words, so they will get low language model probability anyway.

The errors in the Acronym class are pretty much similar to foreign names. Since the letter-by-letter pronunciation is not modelled, the acronyms usually cause errors.

The next largest class is Inflect , which contains errors where the root of the word is correctly rec-ognized, but the inflectional form is slightly wrong (for example: autolla /autolle , kirjee ksi/kirjei ksi ). In these errors, it is usually the language model that prefers the erroneous hypothesis.
 The most difficult classes to improve are perhaps Poor and Noise . For bad pronunciations and repairs it is not even clear what the correct answer should be. Should it be the word the speaker tried to say, or the word that was actually said? As expected, the language model would have preferred the correct hy-pothesis in most cases, but the acoustic model have chosen the wrong hypothesis.
 The Name and Rare are also difficult classes. Contrary to the foreign names and acronyms, the pronunciation model is not a problem.
The Compound errors are mainly in HYP-LM re-gions, which is natural since there is usually lit-tle acoustic evidence at the word boundary. Fur-thermore, it is sometimes difficult even for humans to know if two words are written together or not. Sometimes the recognizer made a compound word error because the compound word was often written incorrectly in the language model training data. 3.3 Frequency Analysis In order to study the effect of rare words in more de-tail, the words in the test data were grouped accord-ing their frequencies in the LM training data: The first group contained all the words that were among the 1000 most common words, the next group con-tained the next 2000 words, then 4000, and so on, until the final group contained all words not present in the training data.

Figure 2 shows the number of letters in the ref-erence (top), number of letter errors (middle), and letter error rate (bottom) for each group. Quite ex-pectedly, the error rates (bottom) rise steadily for the infrequent words and is highest for the new words that were not seen in the training data. But looking at the absolute number of letter errors (middle), the majority occur in the 1000 most frequent words. SAT and MPFE training seem to correct different error regions: SAT helps when the acoustic model dominates and MPFE elsewhere. The manual error classification suggests that improving the pronunci-ation modeling of foreign words and acronyms is a potential area for improvement. The frequency anal-ysis shows that a major part of the recognition errors occur still in the 1000 most common words. One solution might be to develop methods for detecting when the problem is in acoustics and to trust the lan-guage model more in these regions.
