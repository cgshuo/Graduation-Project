 Mandarin Chinese is one of the most dif ficult lan-guages for a nati ve English speak er to learn. Chi-nese is substantially more dif ficult to master than the traditional European languages currently being taught in America  X  French, Spanish, German, etc., because of the lack of common roots in the vocab-ulary , the novel tonal and writing systems, and the distinctly dif ferent syntactic structure.

It is widely agreed among educators that the best way to learn to speak a foreign language is to en-gage in natural con versation with a nati ve speak er of the language. Yet this is also one of the most costly ways to teach a language, due to the inherently one-to-one student-teacher ratio that it implies.
Recent research in the Spok en Language Systems group at MIT has focused on the idea of designing entertaining computer games as a device for teach-ing a foreign language, with initial emphasis on the language pair , English and Mandarin. The games are accessible at a Web page, and the student X  s speech is captured from a headset microphone to support nat-ural spok en dialogue interaction. The system can also be installed to run completely stand-alone on the local laptop computer . The demonstrated systems comprise two related ac-tivities, the translation game and the dialo gue game . The translation game serv es as preparation for the dialogue game: the user acquires expertise in speak-ing within the domain in the tar get language. The system randomly presents sentences in English and asks the student to speak a sentence of equi valent meaning in Mandarin. To imitate the competiti ve spirit of video games, the system offers ten dif ficulty levels, which are automatically adjusted depending on the student X  s monitored performance. After ad-vancing to the highest dif ficulty level, the y will sub-sequently be much better equipped to con verse with the system within the dialogue game.

The dialo gue game involv es spok en con versa-tional interaction to solv e a particular scenario. The student and computer are task ed with jointly solv-ing a specified goal. Dif fering dif ficulty levels are achie ved via the device of a robotic tutor who assists the student in solving their side of the con versation. 2.1 Translation Game The translation game is moti vated by the learning approach adv ocated by Pimsleur (1967). By prac-ticing translation repeatedly , language learners are able to internalize the structures of the tar get lan-guage, and thus the vocab ulary , grammar rules, and pronunciation are practiced concurrently . The user begins by translating isolated vocab ulary items in Le vel 1, adv ancing to phrases and full sentences at higher levels. The most dif ficult level, Le vel 10, in-volv es long and complicated sentences.

We have implemented this game in two domains: (1) flight reserv ations, and (2) hobbies and sched-ules. Details of the translation procedure can be found in (W ang and Senef f, 2006), and the algo-rithm for assessment is described in detail in (W ang and Senef f, 2006). The input utterance is processed through the speech recognizer and language under -standing (Senef f, 1992) components, to achie ve a simple encoding of its meaning. The system com-pares this meaning representation to one automati-cally deri ved from the tar geted English equi valent. The system then speaks a paraphrase of the user X  s hypothesized utterance in both Chinese and En-glish (Baptist and Senef f, 2000). If it has determined that the student was successful, it congratulates them and prompts them with the next English sentence for translation. At any time, the student can ask for as-sistance, in which case the system will pro vide them with a  X  X orrect X  translation of the English utterance, which the y can then attempt to imitate. 2.2 Dialogue Game In the dialogue game (Senef f, 2006), the user is ask ed to solv e a particular scenario, by role play-ing a specified persona, which changes dynamically every time the game is played. We will demonstrate the dialogue game in the hobbies and schedules do-main. The student is pro vided with a specification of their preferences for participating in possible ac-tivities (swimming, dancing, watching mo vies, etc.) as well as a calendar specifying acti vities the y are planning to do in the next few days. The y are task ed with arranging with the computer to jointly partici-pate in an acti vity that the y both lik e, at a time when both are free. Another option is for either party to invite the other one to join them in an acti vity that is already on their schedule.

In addition to the robotic dialogue partner , the stu-dent is assisted in solving the task by a robotic tutor , who helps them plan what to say next. The tutor works with the same information that the student has, and independently plans the student X  s half of the con versation. At each dialogue turn, it pro vides a proposed response, based on the evolving dialogue conte xt. Five dif ferent dif ficulty levels have been implemented, as follo ws: 1. Eavesdr opping: The student can simply let the 2. Parr oting: The system presents a proposed sen-3. Translation: The system presents an English 4. Char acter s: The system presents the Chinese 5. Solo: The tutor stops being pro-acti ve, but can
Both the translation game and the dialogue game will be illustrated live in the demonstration. The systems can be evaluated by two types of basic per -formance measures: (1) for each system, the recog-nition accurac y and the translation accurac y serv e as an inde x of quality; (2) calculating the success rate in the translation game and the number of turns tak en to complete each dialogue will pro vide a quan-titati ve vie w of interaction. Also a pre-&amp; post-test design in the user study will further confirm the ped-agogic value of the systems. Ongoing and future work involv es expanding the domains supported and introducing the games to the classroom setting.
