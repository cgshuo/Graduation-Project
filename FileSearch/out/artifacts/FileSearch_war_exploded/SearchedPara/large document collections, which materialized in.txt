 large document collections, which materialized in TREC. As in her previous reviews of TREC, included in the special issues of IP&amp; M, Sparck Jones discusses the successes and failures of TREC, its impact on IR research and on commercial search engines and, more importantly, its challenges for the future. This includes the need to engage with the heterogeneity of the Web, the need to deal with new data types and media, the need to consider new tasks, and the need to explore the integration of IR tools in the context of information manage-ment services and personalized delivery of information.

TREC has had a significant impact on IR research by being a test-bed for new ideas and models, and through contributions from some of the most creative and active IR researchers and research groups. Signif-icantly, it is one of the few venues where bad results are as welcome as good ones, and where the purpose is to understand what works and what does not, and why. Therefore, the reader of this book can find out not only what the state of the art is, but also what was tried and did not work.

I recommend this book to a variety of readers. Researchers new to IR or unfamiliar with TREC can read the entire book in order to better understand their field of research, to find out what the hot issues are, and who are the leading researchers in this field. Moreover, experimental settings and evaluation methodologies widely adopted in the field are described in some detail, so the new researchers do not need to re-invent the wheel. Previous TREC participants who want to move to new tracks can also benefit from the book, by studying the appropriate chapters. Even for seasoned IR researchers the book is extremely useful, serving as a reference source that can be more easily consulted than the entire collection of TREC proceedings. Final-ly, this can be an interesting read for any researchers in Computer Science or Information Science with an interest in search engines, in the functionality that these are expected to support and in ways in which these should be evaluated.
 Handbook of Evaluation Methods for Health Informatics, Jytte Brender (2005). ISBN: 0-12-370464-2,  X 69.95
Identifying the right evaluation techniques is an area of considerable interest to both academics and prac-titioners in the area of healthcare informatics. With an increasing reliance on healthcare information systems, appropriate evaluation is essential to the continuing development of usable and useful technologies. Many healthcare studies point to failures in evaluation as a primary reason for information system failures (Ander-son, Aydin, &amp; Jay, 1994). Furthermore, the diversity of the healthcare information technology precludes any one method from dominating the field. Therefore, we need to understand the different variety of evaluation methods that are available to us.

Against this backdrop, we read with some interest The Handbook of Evaluation Methods for Health Infor-matics by Jytte Brender. The book is divided into three main parts. The four chapters in part 1 serve as the foundation for the book. In this part, the author introduces evaluation and discusses the conceptual under-pinnings of evaluation. Part 1 attempts to provide readers a basic understanding of evaluation. Part 2 is the  X  X  X eart X  X  of the book and focuses on methods and techniques of evaluation. The author discusses thirty-six different evaluation techniques. Clearly, these are not all the known evaluation techniques but the author does a more than adequate job of providing coverage of different types of techniques. They range from qual-itative techniques (e.g. field studies) to quantitative techniques (e.g. randomized control trials). Finally, part 3 discusses the challenges and pitfalls of evaluation and how to avoid them. She discusses such pitfalls as judg-mental biases, post-rationalizations, and false conclusions.

Because of the number of techniques, the author uses a standard framework to discuss each technique. The framework consists of briefly discussing: (1) areas of application (2) description (3) assumptions for applica-tions (4) perspectives (5) frame of reference for interpretation (6) perils and pitfalls (7) advice and comments and (8) supplementary readings. She uses a set of icons at the beginning of each technique section to describe the usefulness of the technique. The author also discusses when to use a given technique in the system lifecycle.
The Handbook is not designed to be read from start to finish. Rather, it is a reference manual. This is the type of book that one would pull off the shelf if she wanted to get some quick information on a particular technique or evaluation problem. Although the book is useful to a wide audience, it may be particularly beneficial to readers who have little knowledge about evaluation and want an easily understandable reference.
However, readers looking at this book to provide insight into evaluation methods, problems, and challenges particular to healthcare will be disappointed. There is actually very little discussion about healthcare related issues. Most of the techniques discussed are general and could be used in a number of domains. The author does provide a number of healthcare informatics references at the end of each technique section for readers.
Yet, when we looked at the title we expected it be more closely tied to the healthcare informatics field which it is not.

Overall, we found the Handbook to be a good if general overview of evaluation and different evaluation techniques. We would encourage readers to buy this book especially if they want a reference guide of evalu-ation techniques.
