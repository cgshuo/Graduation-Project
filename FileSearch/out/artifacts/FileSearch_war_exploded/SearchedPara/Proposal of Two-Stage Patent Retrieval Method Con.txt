A typical claim structure, called  X  X epson Style, X  consists of two components, as shown in Figure 1: portion and an essential portion. 
The characteristics of patent documents that affect retrieval accuracy are as follows: vary widely, which makes term-matching accuracy worse. like chemistry, medicine, mechanics, computers, foods, and business models, the affects the term-extraction and weighting-algorithms. titles and claims using vague (abstract) terms like  X  X nformation processing apparatus, X  which prevents direct term-matching. 3. TECHNICAL ISSUES OF PATENT RETRIEVAL to generic information retrieval: (A) How to extract appropriate terms part) others) (B) How to assign an appropriate weight to each term (C) How to treat allomorphs and synonyms automatically or manually) (D) How to retrieve the relevant patent documents without TF and the use of measurement terms a ddress (B-1) (for other issues, see Mase et al. [2004]). 4. TWO-STAGE PATENT RETRIEVAL METHOD 4.1 Overview documents (326 documents) in the top 1000 documents than that using claims only as a retrieval target (257 documents). portion is ignored. When a preamble portion cannot be identified, the entire query claim target. score S(i) of document i is calculated using the following formula: S1 X  is the average value of the scores of th e top N documents retrieved in stage 1;  X  X v. on measurement terms to improve precision. This method is peculiar to patent documents. A measurement term is one that could be accompanied by numerical values. Such terms are important because some claims emphasi ze novelty by using numerical conditions. measurement terms like  X  X H X . We collected 36 1 measurement terms. Note that in Table 1 the suffixes themselves are treated as measurement terms. with a measurement term. For example, in the phrase  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  they modify the measurement term  X   X  X  X  (speed) X . additional weight. 4.1.3 Term-Weighting Without Term Frequency . The weight W(i) of term i in a query is calculated using the following formula: where TF(i) is the term frequency of term i in a query; DF(i) is the number of documents the number of documents in the patent database. following three reasons: Thus, in our two-stage retrieval method, a simple term-weighting method is used. The TF the following form: This method is applied in both stage 1 and stage 2. 4.2 Processing Flow mentioned in this article (see Mase et al. [2004] for more details). 1 increased from 326 to 334 when we used our filtering methods. steps enclosed in heavy lines in Figure 3): 5. EXPERIMENTS we used the evaluation method of the NTCIR4 Patent Retrieval Task [Kando 2004; Fujii et al. 2004]. 5.1 The Data Set Approximately 1.7 million patent documents (five years X  worth, 1993-1997) were prepared as a patent database. We used the fo rmal query claim data of the NTCIR4 Patent topics (ADD) X . MAIN consists of 34 topics that have 344 relevant patents (10.1 relevant called RIGID) and Set-A+Set-B (hereafter called RELAXED). data, consisting of some of the patents published in January 1999, was collected from the Japan Patent Office (JPO). 1 were retrieved. 5.2 Evaluation Measurements The official evaluation measurem ents in the NTCIR4 Patent Retrieval Task are the Mean Average Precision (MAP) and the number of relevant documents in the top 1000 output calculated using the following formula: relevant and 0 otherwise). documents whose rank improved when the method was applied. 5.3 Experiment Environment 2000], and GETA, 3 a free morphological-based general-purpose search engine [Takano et al. 2002]. 5.4 Experiment Patterns detail in this article (for other methods, see Mase et al. [2004]): 5.5 Results and Discussion 5.5.1 Query Term-Weighting Without TF . The evaluation result for query term-weighting 0.2696 in MAIN (); 0.2142 to 0.2393 in MAIN (); and 0.1411 to 0.1607 in PRE). In ADD, however, the MAPs are almost the same (0.1100 to 0.1088 in ADD (RIGID) and 0.1107 to 0.1097 in ADD (RELAXED)). variance of TF values is high). In MAIN and PR E, the MAPs in TF=1 are better in almost lower in the groups whose maximum value of TF is less than three. groups. The MAP is especially bad in the group whose maximum value of TF is two or three in ADD is higher (40.3%) than that in PRE (20.6%) and in MAIN (38.2%), which results in a lower total MAP. in ADD (RELAXED) (43.5%) and PRE (48.5%). combination of the following alternatives: (a) Query term-extraction target : the entire query claim or only the essential portion? (b) Retrieval target : the whole text or only the claims? (c) Selecting target documents of the relevant score calculation : all documents in the retrieval target (#1-2, #1-3, and #1-4) contributed to improving MAPs in any of the three retrieval target. 
Table III (#2) shows that the MAPs improved when the target documents for calculating the score were limited to the top 1000 retrieved documents in stage 1 (#2-2, #2-3, and #2-4), but that the MAP values were still lower than the baseline (#1-1). Note that in #2, the score in stage 2 was used as the final relevant score. improving MAP up to 6.0% (0.1607 to 0.1703 in PRE). It is remarkable that limiting the query term extraction target and the text retrieval target improved MAPs when they were sets, except for MAIN (RIGID), in which MAP worked best when the whole text was the retrieval target. 
Table IV compares MAPs according to weight-tuning parameter P in Eq. (1). Although widely among the test sets: 0.075 in PRE and 0.025 in MAIN and ADD. every test set improved their rank (57.9% = 128/(128+93) in MAIN (RELAXED); 60.3% in ADD (RELAXED); and 60.3% in PRE). 5.5.3 Query Term-Weighting with Measurement Terms. The results of this evaluation are this weighting method, the weight values of only a few terms were changed, which does not affect the relevant score very much. MAIN (RELAXED); and 80.0% (=28/(28+7)) in ADD (RELAXED). These values are much higher than those of the other two methods in Table VI (#1 and #2). The degree of between 11 and 1000, while it was relatively weak between 1 and 10, which resulted in a lower total MAP. Overall, as shown in Table VII, our proposed methods were effective, but the degree of by performing an analysis acco rding to technical field. 6. RELATED WORK 6.1 Studies Related to the Two-Stage Retrieval Method proposed a measure called  X  X over density ranking, X  which is based on term proximity and identify and weigh terms for higher precision in stage 2. to search entire texts in the database. the next stage. The final score is calculate d based on the score in the last stage. weighting methods in each retrieval stage. claim is divided into components, then a patent retrieval is executed by component, and query term-extraction method, query-weighting method, and retrieval target are different ours, see Fujii et al. [2004]. proposed a claim structure analysis method that uses specific expression patterns. Though claim structure for more accurate patent retrieval is another direction to pursue. 6.2 Term-Weighting with Measurement Terms This approach focuses on the semantic term attributes. Most generic question-answering term attributes to identify 5W1H information. However, measurement terms are used as a documents. 6.3 Term-Weighting Without TF applied to the terms in an entire patent document. In our approach, on the other hand, we usage of terms in claims is more redundan t than in any other parts of the document. simpler. 7. CONCLUSION is precision-oriented retrieval that uses micro-level analysis. that in stage 1. distribution. Although query term-weighting with measurement terms does not contribute to improving MAP, it can improve the retrieval ranks of 70% to 80% of queries. abstract. formulas should be considered.
