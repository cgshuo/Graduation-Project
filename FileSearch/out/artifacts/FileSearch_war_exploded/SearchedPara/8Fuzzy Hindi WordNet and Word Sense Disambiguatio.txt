 WordNet [Fellbaum 1998] is an online lexical reference system that has become an im-portant resource for natural language processing (NLP). It has been used in many NLP applications, such as information retrieval, text summarization, machine translation, and question answering [Miller and Fellbaum 2007]. Its design is inspired by the psy-cholinguistic principle of human lexical memory. It contains nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, and describes different types of relationships among them. Unlike in a traditional dictionary, in Hindi WordNet the lexical information is organized in terms of word meanings rather than word forms. Word senses in Hindi WordNet are repre-sented rationally by a synonym set (synset), i.e., the set of all words having similar meanings [Narayan et al. 2002]. Hindi WordNet encodes lexical and semantic relations, wherein the former connects pairs of word senses and the latter relates synsets. For instance, there is a semantic relation  X  X eronymy X  between (  X  ama) and (gut . hal  X   X ) and  X  X olonymy X  between (gut . hal  X   X ) and (  X  ama). All relations defined in Hindi WordNet are crisp in nature, i.e., the terms/words are either fully related or not related at all. But in many real-life scenarios expressed in natural language, relations between words (terms may interchangeably be used for words) as a matter of degree. In a natural language, some words are related and some are not, and in between there is a gradual transition from not being related to being related. Therefore, it seems more natural to represent an association between words as a matter of degree, i.e., there is a gradual transition from not being related to being related. Therefore, it seems more natural to represent an association between words by a mapping W  X  W  X  [0, 1] (with W being the universe of Hindi words), i.e., by a fuzzy relation instead of a traditional relation. For example, (lad . ak  X   X ) and (aurata), (vidy  X  alaya) and (sa  X  msth  X  ana) are closely related (since they share approximately similar meaning) and can replace each other in many contexts. But in Hindi WordNet, partial truth is not defined; therefore, these words are considered to be  X  X ot related X  because (lad . ak  X   X ) and (aurata), can be made for other relations existing between words in Hindi WordNet, like the  X  X as-part X  (meronymy/holonymy) relation. In the real world, a concept may partially belong to the other concept, e.g., (p  X  ed . a) and (phala). It is easy to observe the fact that every tree doesn X  X  have fruit, but most trees do. Since context plays a significant role in NLP, fuzzification of relations may help to process natural language in a better way. As Hindi WordNet defines only classical relations (also called crisp relations ), the words in natural language with partial relationships cannot be processed by the Hindi WordNet. Therefore, there is a strong need to extend Hindi WordNet by incorporating fuzzy relations to process the natural language text in a more accurate and efficient manner.
 In this article, we propose enriching Hindi WordNet by extending it in two ways. First, we employ the concept of fuzzy graphs to represent Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. This allows a generalization of the relations in Hindi WordNet. The relation can now be given a membership value between [0, 1] rather than simply representing the existence or nonexistence of a relation. Here, the idea of strength of relation plays a significant role. The second and more interesting concept proposed is the composition of different types of fuzzy relations. We also propose fuzzy graph connectivity measures that in-clude both local and global measures. Further, we show how the results of word sense disambiguation (WSD) can be improved by using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet compared to Hindi WordNet.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, the work available in the literature related to fuzzy set theory and NLP are discussed. In Section 3, we describe a review of preliminaries, namely fuzzy set theory and fuzzy graphs, and briefly introduce Hindi WordNet, which was developed at IIT Bombay, India. In Section 4, we propose Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. Section 5 illustrates how WSD can be achieved at a higher level using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. Section 6 represents the time complexity, experimental setup, and results when Hindi WordNet/Fuzzy Hindi WordNet is used. Finally, in Section 7, we offer our conclusion. To incorporate the imprecise and uncertain information in natural language [Bezdek et al. 1986; Chen et al. 2001, 2003; Cock et al. 2005; Diou et al. 2006; Martin 1992], the fuzzy set theory [Zadeh 1965] has been widely applied. In the early 1990s, Martin [1992] presented the concept of space as a network of fuzzy relationships called fuzzy concept networks by allowing four types of fuzzy relations between concepts, i.e., positive association, negative association, generalization, and specialization. Further, in the early years of the 21st century, fuzzy concept networks were used by Chen et al. [2001, 2003] to enhance the performance of information retrieval. Since the construction of fuzzy concept networks manually was a tedious task, a method to construct the networks was developed [Chen et al. 2003]. Initially, Rosenfeld et al. [1975] reviewed the basic properties of fuzzy relations and generalized to the case where the underlying set is a fuzzy set. Fuzzy analogues of several basic graph-theoretic concepts, e.g., bridges and trees, are also defined by Rosenfeld et al. Then, Sunitha [2001] proposed the concepts of fuzzy bridges, fuzzy cutnodes, fuzzy trees, blocks, and metrics in fuzzy graphs defined by Rosenfeld et al. [1975]. Sunitha also modified the definition of the complement of a fuzzy graph. More recently, fuzzy graphs have been used by Yager [2010] to represent the relations in social networks. Fuzzy declarative approach is also used by researchers to classify unlabeled short texts [Romero et al. 2012].
Navigli [2009] completed a survey on WSD in which its methods were divided into three subcategories, namely supervised, unsupervised, and knowledge-based meth-ods. In his work, the author mentioned some other approaches, i.e., domain-driven disambiguation. To deal with the ambiguity in natural language, Navigli and Lap-ata [2010] used the measures of graph connectivity from social network analysis like degree centrality [Freeman 1979], the key player problem [Borgatti 2006], Hypertext Induced Topic Selection (HITS) [Gupta 2006], and PageRank and betweenness cen-trality [Freeman 1979; Newman 2005]. Navigli and Lapata [2010] also categorized the results into two categories, namely local measures and global measures. In their work, the researchers used WordNet sense inventory [Fellbaum 1998]. This indicates that the graph-based WSD algorithm performs better with more densely connected sense inventories and more incident edges for every node. The performance of these NLP ap-plications highly depends on the sense inventory used (WordNet). Moreover, since the acquisition of lexicons for this was a challenging task, the methods to automatically ac-quire lexicons were proposed [Widdow and Dorow 2002]. Extension of WordNet was also proposed by Navigli [2005]. However, one of the main obstacles to high-performance WSD was the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Ponzetto and Navigli [2010] presented a methodology to automatically extend WordNet with large amounts of semantic re-lations from Wikipedia. In 2010, a work on translating politeness across cultures was done [Kumar and Jha 2010]. In 2013, Sheinman worked on identifying and encoding intensity relations among adjectives in WordNet [Sheinman et al. 2013]. Lack of la-beled data is one of the most severe problems facing WSD. Fujita and Fujino [2013] overcome the problem by combining automatic labeled data expansion and semisuper-vised learning. Recently, researchers worked on automatically resolving ambiguity in query expansion to improve retrieval performance [Jain et al. 2014a].
 Researchers at IIT Bombay developed Hindi WordNet, which is widely used for many NLP applications. Hindi WordNet is used in resolving ambiguity in Hindi language [Jain et al. 2013; Sinha et al. 2004; Dwivedi and Rastogi 2008]. Hindi WordNet is also used for Hindi query expansion [Das et al. 2010] and query optimization [Kumar and Mansotra 2012]. IndoWordNet was built by the expansion method from HindiWordNet [Bhattacharyya 2010]. It groups 16 of India X  X  22 languages. It is also linked to the English synsets. By exploiting ontology in Hindi WordNet, information retrieval is optimized by the researchers [Sharan et al. 2011]. Jain et al. [2014b] used Wikipedia to automatically generate synsets in WordNets for Indian languages. Recently, Jain et al. [2014c] used Hindi WordNet for retrieving Web search results in soft clusters for a Hindi query.

After going through the literature, we find that the researchers have not explored the possibility of partial belongingness (fuzziness) that may exist in Hindi words among themselves. Therefore, in this article, we propose the concept of fuzzy relations in Hindi WordNet and subsequently apply it to WSD of Hindi text using fuzzy graph connectivity measures proposed by us in Section 5. In this section, we introduce the preliminary concepts of fuzzy sets, fuzzy graphs, and Hindi WordNet that we use in this work. A mathematical framework to describe fuzzy logic was suggested by Zadeh [1965] in his seminal paper entitled  X  X uzzy Sets. X  A sharp, unambiguous distinction exists between the members and nonmembers of the class represented by the crisp set. However, many of the terms that we commonly use, such as tall and beauty (called linguistic variables ), do not exhibit this characteristic. Klir and Folger [1998] call this a mismatch problem : the world is gray, but science is black and white. The fuzzy principle proposed by Zadeh is that  X  X verything is a matter of degree. X  Thus, the membership in a fuzzy set is not a matter of affirmation or denial but rather a matter of degree.

Membership function  X  A (also known as characteristic function) in crisp set A maps the members in universal set X to set {0, 1}. The concept of fuzzy sets is a general-ization of the crisp sets [Lee 2005]. In fuzzy sets, each element is mapped to [0, 1] by membership function where [0, 1] denotes the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 (including 0, 1). Conse-quently, a fuzzy set is a vague boundary set as compared to a crisp set [Yen and Langari 2005].

A fuzzy graph [Rosenfeld et al. 1975; Sunitha 2001; Zadeh et al. 1975; Mathew and Sunitha 2009; Bhattacharya 1987] defined as G = (  X ,  X  ) is a pair of functions  X  Any relation R  X  S  X  S on a set S can be represented as a graph with node set S and arc set R . Similarly, any fuzzy relation  X  : S  X  S  X  [0 , 1] can be regarded as defining a fuzzy graph, where the arc ( x , y )  X  S  X  S has weight  X  ( x , y )  X  [0 , 1]. Hindi WordNet is a system for bringing together different lexical and semantic relations between Hindi words. It organizes the lexical information in terms of word meanings and can be termed as a lexicon based on psycholinguistic principles. Hindi WordNet is widely used in many NLP applications [Avneet 2010; Jain et al. 2013; Mishra et al. 2009; Sinha and Siddiqui 2012; Sinha et al. 2004]. In this, for each word there is a synset representing one lexical concept. Synsets are the basic building blocks of Hindi WordNet. The lexicon deals with the content words or open-class category of words. Thus, Hindi WordNet contains the following categories of words: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

Each entry in Hindi WordNet consists of the entries synset, gloss (description of concept), and position in ontology. 3.2.1. Relations in Hindi WordNet. Hindi WordNet is a network of word senses. A word sense node in this network is a synset that is regarded as a basic object in WordNet. Each synset in Hindi WordNet is linked to other synsets through the well-known lexical and semantic relations such as hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy, troponymy, antonymy, and entailment. Semantic relations exist between synsets, and lexical relations exist between words. These relations serve to organize the lexical knowledge base. In Hindi WordNet, relations are also defined to connect cross parts of speech, namely linkage between nominal and verbal concepts, nominal and adjectival concepts, and adverbial and verbal concepts. For the sake of brevity, other details of Hindi WordNet are omitted. For more clarity introduction to Hindi WordNet at http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/ can be referred.

Although Hindi WordNet has become an indispensible resource for NLP, the main obstacle to high-performance NLP applications is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Next, we describe some of the prominent causes.

Absence of proper expressiveness . Typically, only classical relations are defined, i.e., either two concepts are fully related or not related at all. However, the natural lan-guage text does not always contain classical relations due to the inherent vagueness present in the human language. Sometimes the relations are  X  X pproximate X  in nature. It is therefore necessary to consider these approximate relations as well to fully un-derstand the natural language text. Consider the pairs of words ( (vidy  X  alaya), are not synonyms under the classical lexicon, although the words are approximately similar and interchangeable in many contexts. In this article, we exploit this observa-tion to fuzzify Hindi WordNet.

Missing composition of semantic relationships . The composition of similar/dissimilar relations is not defined in Hindi WordNet. Although Hindi WordNet is a computa-tional lexicon that resembles an associative network, due to undefined composition of relations, presently it is rather a passive data structure that does not support infer-ences. For instance, ( (v  X  ahana), (k  X  ara)) shares a hypernymy X  X yponymy relation and ( (k  X  ara), (pahiy  X  a)) shares a meronymy X  X olonymy relation, but the relation between ( (v  X  ahana), (pahiy  X  a)) is not defined in Hindi WordNet. In the present work, we define the composition of fuzzy relations to extract the exact meaning of real-world concepts such as ( (v  X  ahana), (pahiy  X  a)) when they are used in natural language sentences. In this section, we fuzzify the relations present in Hindi WordNet. The fuzzy relations can exhibit semantics between the words more effectively, and therefore fuzzification of Hindi WordNet overcomes the limitations of Hindi WordNet discussed in the previous section. The proposed fuzzified Hindi WordNet by incorporating fuzzy relations between the words is referred to as Fuzzy Hindi WordNet in this work. Since it is believed that fuzziness is more natural [Martin 1992], Fuzzy Hindi WordNet can provide more expressiveness than Hindi WordNet.

We render Fuzzy Hindi WordNet as a fuzzy graph where nodes represent concepts (synsets) and edges represent fuzzy relations between concepts. The weight of an edge represents the strength of the relation between two concepts/synsets. The value of strength varies from 0 to 1. More value of strength indicates a closer relationship between the concepts, i.e., synsets. It is clear that a strength value of 1 indicates a classical relation between the words/concepts, whereas a 0 value indicates no relation. It may be noted that since fuzzy logic is a generalization of classical logic, all classical relations defined in Hindi WordNet are incorporated in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet with a membership value of 1.

Formally, we define relations in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet as follows. Let W be a universal set of Hindi open class words/concepts. A relation R  X  W  X  W exists on a set W , where W includes all nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Hindi WordNet can be represented as a graph with node set W and arc set R . Similarly, a fuzzy relation  X  R : W  X  W  X  [0 , 1] can be represented as a fuzzy graph, where the arc ( x , y )  X  W  X  W has weight  X 
R ( x
Formally, Fuzzy Hindi WordNet can be represented as a special fuzzy graph G = (  X ,  X  ), which is a pair of functions  X  : W  X  X  1 } and  X  : W  X  W  X  [0 , 1], where  X  is the set of nodes that represents the set of Hindi open-class words (set of synsets) in which the strength of every node is 1. It means that every Hindi word fully belongs to Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. The  X  denotes the strength of an edge between two Hindi words. The mapping shows the strength of relations between any two Hindi words.

Each entry in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet consists of a synset, gloss (description of the concept/synset), and position in ontology (the hierarchical organization of concepts), similar to Hindi WordNet. Now we propose the definition of the fuzzy relations in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. Fuzzy Hindi WordNet is a word sense network. A word sense node in this network is a synset that is regarded as a basic object in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. Each synset in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet is linked to other synsets through well-known lexical and semantic relations such as fuzzy hypernymy, fuzzy hyponymy, fuzzy meronymy, fuzzy troponymy, fuzzy antonymy, and fuzzy entailment. Semantic relations are between synsets, and lexical relations are between words. These relations serve to organize the lexical knowledge base.

There are 17 relations in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. These relations are described next. Fuzzy Association Hindi WordNet, which is a classical lexicon, provides synsets where each element of a synset has exactly similar meaning. In the Hindi language, we use in our day-to-day conversation many words that do not have exactly similar meaning but may have approximate similar meanings and can replace each other in many contexts, e.g., approximately similar meanings, then they are related to fuzzy association relation. A fuzzy association relation is a semantic relation between two synsets to represent the partially similar meanings of two concepts. It can be written as ( (vidy  X  alaya, p  X  at . ha  X  s  X  al  X  a, sk  X  ula, p  X  at . h  X  alaya)) 0 sents the strength of the relation.
 between two synsets ( w 1 and w 2 ), where w 1 , w 2  X  W and  X  as : W  X  W  X  [0, 1] such that w 1 and w 2 are approximate synonyms. Here, W denotes the set of all concepts/synsets and  X  as is the strength of fuzzy association relation.

Fuzzy association is a fuzzy relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and max- X  -transitive.

Some more examples of fuzzy association are ( (alam  X  ar  X   X ), (raika),0.7), brevity, we have used only one word from the synset.
 Fuzzy Hypernymy and Fuzzy Hyponymy Two synsets are said to share a fuzzy hypernymy/fuzzy hyponymy relationship if they approximately capture the superset/subset hood relationship. If w 1 ,w 2  X  W are two Hindi synsets, then ( w 1 ,w 2 , X  hr / X  hp ) is a fuzzy hypernym/hyponym relation between w 1 and W  X  W  X  [0 , 1].

Fuzzy hypernymy/fuzzy hyponymy is a semantic relation between two synsets to capture partial superset/subset hood, respectively. For example, there is a fuzzy hypernymy/hyponymy relation between (mat . t . h  X  a) and (dah  X   X ), and it can be written as ( (mat . t . h  X  a, mat . h  X  a, m  X  at . h  X  a, ch  X  acha, takra, p  X  adajala, aris . t . a, malina, pr  X  agr  X  at . a)) 0 is the strength of the fuzzy hypernymy/hyponymy relation.

Some more examples may include ( (dukh  X   X ), (par  X  e  X  s  X  ana), 0.9), ( (sajjana), (day  X  alu), 0.8), ( (parsa), (baiga), 0.6), (Teaching-cum-research-fellow, (adhy  X  apaka), 0.7), ( (kr .  X  ura), (durjana), 0.9), kat . ara), (hathiy  X  ara), 0.6), ( (sajjana), (  X   X m  X  anad  X  ara), 0.8), ( (dus . t . a), relations represents its synset; for the sake of brevity, we have used only one word from the synset.

Figure 1 shows the strength of the fuzzy hypernym/hyponym relationship be-tween ( (kr .  X  ura), (durjana)), ( (dus . t . a), (durjana)), and ( (b  X  e  X   X m  X  ana), lation.

Fuzzy hypernymy (  X  hr : W  X  W  X  [0 , 1]) and fuzzy hyponymy (  X  hp : W  X  W  X  [0 , 1]) are fuzzy relations that are antireflexive, antisymmetric, and max- X  -transitive. Fuzzy Meronymy and Fuzzy Holonymy Fuzzy meronymy and fuzzy holonymy are semantic relations that are used to cap-ture the partial  X  X art X  X hole X  relation between two synsets, e.g., ( (gatt  X  a, kut . a, daft  X   X , vasal  X   X )) 0 not have (gatt  X  a), but many (kit  X  aba) do. Fuzzy meronymy is the reverse of fuzzy holonymy.

Fuzzy meronymy and fuzzy holonymy are the semantic relations represented as ( w can be defined similarly.

Fuzzy meronymy and fuzzy holonymy are fuzzy relations that are antireflexive, antisymmetric, and max- X  -transitive.

Some more examples may include ( (phala), ,0.7),( (ch  X  atrav  X  asa), ( (jv  X  arabh  X  at .  X  a), (samundr . ), 0.5). Each word in these relations represents its synset.
 Fuzzy Antonymy Fuzzy antonymy is a lexical relation that holds between two words (not between two synsets) expressing approximately opposite meaning. Fuzzy antonymy is a fuzzy re-lation represented as ( w 1 ,w 2 , X  an ), where  X  an : W  X  W  X  [0 , 1] and w 1 ,w 2  X  W .For example,
Some more examples may include ( (par  X  e  X  s  X  ana), (khu  X  sa), 0.8), ( (dhundhal  X  a), (camakad  X  ara), 0.6), ( (kr .  X  ura), (sajjana), 0.7), and ( (day  X  alu), (b  X  e  X   X m  X  ana), 0.7).

Fuzzy antonymy is a fuzzy relation  X  an : W  X  W  X  [0 , 1] that is antireflexive, symmetric, and max- X  -nontransitive.
 Fuzzy Entailment A verb A entails a verb B if the truth of B follows logically from the truth of A .Itisa one-way relation. Fuzzy entailment (a semantic relation) holds between two synsets of verbs if the truth of verb B partially follows the truth of verb A .

Fuzzy entailment can be represented as ( v 1 v ,v is the strength/membership value of the fuzzy entailment relation. For example, ( (saphalat  X  a milan  X  a, q  X  amay  X  ab  X   X  milan  X  a, k  X  amay  X  ab  X   X  milan  X  a, vijaya milan  X  a)) 0 karan  X  a, pas  X   X n  X  a bah  X  an  X  a)).

This means that acquiring  X  (saphalat  X  a) X  follows logically from doing  X  (pari  X  srama) X  with a membership degree of 0.8.

Some more examples may be (s  X  on  X  a) 0  X  an  X  a) 0 karan  X  a), (camakan  X  a) 0 karan  X  a) 0
Fuzzy entailment is a fuzzy relation  X  e : V  X  V  X  [0 , 1] that is reflexive, antisym-metric, and max- X  -transitive.
 Fuzzy Troponymy Fuzzy troponymy (a semantic relation) is a relation between the synset of two verbs, one denoting elaboration of another verb in an approximately specific manner.
The fuzzy troponymy relation can be represented as ( v 1 ,v 2 , X  t ), where  X  t : V  X  V  X  [0 , 1] and v The  X  t is the strength/membership value of the fuzzy troponymy relation. For example,
This means that  X  (pad . han  X  a, par . h  X  a  X   X  karan  X  a) X  is an elaboration of  X  (s  X   X khan  X  a) X  with a membership degree of 0.8. Some more examples may be 0.7). Each word in these relations represents its synset.
 rapht  X  ara s  X  e, t  X  eja gati s  X  e)) 1 used to describe (bh  X  agan  X  a), so the membership value of this relation is always unity, i.e., it is always a classical relation.
 Fuzzy Derived From The fuzzy derived from relation is a lexical relation. Fuzzy derived from specifies the root form from which a particular word is derived. For example, ( (kr . ma  X  sah . ), (kr . ma), 1) (kr . ma  X  sah . ) is the adverb that is used to describe the verb (kr . ma) only. The membership value of this relation is always unity, i.e., it is always a classical relation.

All relations between cross parts of speech are the fuzzy relations  X  :W  X  W  X  [0, 1], which are antireflexive, antisymmetric, and max- X  -nontransitive.

We now discuss the method to obtain the membership values between any two con-cepts. In the literature, the method of expert opinion has been used to assign the membership value between any two concepts in a fuzzy relation. In this method, multiple experts in the domain are consulted to derive the membership value between two concepts. Chen et al. [2001] used expert opinion for document retrieval to assign the membership value to the fuzzy relations between concepts in fuzzy-valued concept networks. In 2003, researchers again extended their work for fuzzy information retrieval based on multirelationship fuzzy concept networks and used expert opinion to establish the membership value in multirelationship fuzzy concept networks [Chen et al. 2003]. Recently, Tayal et al. [2014] also used the expert opinion method to assign the fuzzy membership value to the academic expertise of a reviewer. The authors then proposed an approach to identify the best reviewer suited to evaluate a submitted research proposal. In the method of expert opinion, a membership value  X  ( C i , C j )  X  [0 , 1] is assigned between any two concepts C i and C j based on the opinion of the domain experts.
 To assign the strength to the fuzzy relations between words proposed in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet, we involved selected renowned Hindi lexicographers X  X xperts in linguistics, Hindi language, computer science, and fuzzy logic. Every expert at the meeting was required to rate a value ranging between 0 and 1 for a relation between every pair of words ( w i ,w j ). As per the expert X  X  own perception and understanding, this value represented the strength of the relation between words w i and w j . The final strength for the two words in various relations was calculated by taking the average of the values assigned by experts. The similar process was repeated for obtaining the membership values between all Hindi words in various fuzzy relations proposed in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. One main feature of Fuzzy Hindi WordNet is that it is not necessary to explicitly provide relations between all pairs of concepts/words. In fact, here each word is connected to every other word (albeit fuzzily). The relation type and strength of connection between two words can be computed by using the concept of composition proposed in this section. By using the inherent transitivity in the relations, we can compute relations between semantically related words even if it is not explicitly given. Note that the strength of connection between any pair of words, say w 1 and w 2 , may be  X 0, X  i.e., the words w 1 and consider the directly linked concepts but also traverse one or more links to find more related concepts. However, for computing the semantic closeness of two concepts, we consider the strength and relation types of the traversed links.
 Table I (matrix M) shows the results of combining relations of different types, and Table II (matrix S) shows the corresponding strength of the combined relation.
Table I can be viewed as an 8  X  8 matrix (M) holding the following inference: where 1 = i = 8 , 1 = j = 8and M ( i , j ) is the element in matrix M at the i th row and j th column.
 between concepts. If there is an X i relation between concepts a and b and a Y j relation The type of relation M ( i, j ) and its corresponding strength can be obtained from Tables I and, respectively. This can be further explained by considering the following example.
Example 1 . ( (v  X  ahana), (k  X  ara)) shares fuzzy hypernymy relation X 2 ,and meronymy ( M ( 2,4 )). The strength of the corresponding relation can be obtained from Table II ( S ( 2,4 )) and comes out to be moderate. Therefore, it conveys that (v  X  ahana) and (r  X  eid . ay  X  o) are moderately related. In other words, it means that in a moder-part of  X  (v  X  ahana) X  with a moderate strength (fuzzy meronymy). Note that in Hindi WordNet, no relation can be defined between (v  X  ahana) and (r  X  eid . ay  X  o). Therefore, it becomes difficult to deal with sentences like  X  but this type of sentence can easily be processed using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet.
After discussing the composition of fuzzy relations, we now propose the concepts for computing the precise strength of composed fuzzy relations using t -norms, which are monotone, commutative, and associative functions T :[0 , 1]  X  [0 , 1]  X  [0 , 1] that are used for fuzzy set intersection [Klir and Folger 1998]. Although a number of t -norm operators have been proposed in the literature, Bonissone and Keith [1986] have shown that for practical purposes, three to five different t -norm operators are sufficient to obtain the results of realistic precision. As a useful set of operators that are good representatives of the range of possible t -norm functions, Bonissone and Keith [1986] proposed the following t -norms:
Suppose that two relations exist with their corresponding strengths as x = 0.8 and y = 0.5. Depending on the t -norm, we can compute the strength of the composed fuzzy relation as 0.3 using T 1 ,0.4using T 2 ,or0.5using T 3 .
 concluded that the operators T 1 makes quite pessimistic results, T 2 makes moderate results, and T 3 makes rather optimistic results. On applying these t -norms on the composition of fuzzy relations defined earlier, the following observations can be made: (1) It is better to use an optimistic t -norm operator for composition of fuzzy relations (2) If a fuzzy association relation is composed with any other relation, it results in that (3) When fuzzy hypernymy (or fuzzy hyponymy) is composed with any other relation, WordNet [Fellbaum 1998] is widely used for WSD [Navigli and Lapata 2010; Erk et al. 2013; Kotle and Bhairal 2009a, 2009b; Banerjee and Pedersen 2002; Mihalcea 2005; Sinha and Mihalcea 2007; Mihalcea and Dragmoir 2011]. In a similar way, Hindi WordNet increasingly is being used for WSD in the Hindi language [Jain et al. 2013; Mishra et al. 2009; Sinha et al. 2004; Avneet 2010; Sinha and Siddiqui 2012; Sandeep and Chanchal 2012]. WSD refers to identifying the meaning of words in a context computationally. Virtually all WSD methods heavily rely on knowledge X  X ither corpora or dictionaries. Therefore, the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck is undoubtedly one of the most important issues in WSD [Navigli 2009].
 In this section, we show that WSD can be achieved at a higher level by using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet and fuzzy graph connectivity measures. Fuzzy Hindi WordNet can be viewed as a fuzzy graph where nodes represent concepts/synsets and edges represent fuzzy relation between concepts/synsets. Relation between any two concepts may be any of the fuzzy relations defined in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. Recently, Jain et al. [2013] proposed a method for WSD by using graph connectivity measures and Hindi WordNet. In Hindi WordNet, an edge represents the relation between concepts, and the weight of the edge (which is always unity) represents the distance between concepts. In Fuzzy Hindi WordNet, the weight of an edge represents the strength of the relation between concepts, and its value always lies in [0, 1]. Jain et al. [2013] used the local and global connectivity measures for Hindi WordNet.

For a fuzzy graph, no local and global connectivity measures have yet been defined in the literature, and thus we first hereby propose local and global connectivity measures for a fuzzy graph. Since Fuzzy Hindi WordNet can be rendered as a fuzzy graph, we will use these measures for disambiguation of Hindi language sentences.
 We propose the local and global measures for a fuzzy graph as follows. 5.1.1. Local Measures for a Fuzzy Graph. Local measures of graph connectivity determine the degree of relevance of a node in the graph. Therefore, they can be viewed as a measure of the influence of vertex over the network. We define local measure ( lm )as lm : V  X  [0 , 1], where a value close to 0 indicates that the vertex or node is peripheral, and a value close to 1 indicates that it is important. For a graph, several local measures of graph connectivity based on centrality have been proposed in the literature [Freeman 1979; Borgatti 2006; Newman 2005; Opsahl et al. 2010; Freeman et al. 1991], where the importance of a node indicates that the node is central, i.e., maximally connected to all other nodes. However, for fuzzy graphs, no centrality measures have yet been defined in the literature.

A special fuzzy graph G = ( V , E ) is a pair of functions V : W  X  X  1 } and E : W  X  W  X  [0 , 1], where V is the set of nodes (synsets) that represents the set of Hindi open-class words W (noun, verb, adjective, adverb) where the strength of every node is always 1. In this section, we propose four well-known measures of centrality, namely degree, eigenvector (PageRank and HITS), closeness, and betweenness centrality, for the fuzzy graph. 5.1.1.1. Degree Centrality. The degree of a node is the simplest centrality measure and is defined as the number of edges terminating at the given node. Zadeh et al. [1975] defined the degree of a vertex in a fuzzy graph ( G ) as follows. The degree of a vertex v (represented as deg f ( v )) in a fuzzy graph is defined as to the possible maximum degreeof a vertex in the fuzzy graph: 5.1.1.2. Eigenvector Centrality. Eigenvector centrality assigns relative scores to all nodes in a graph based on the recursive principle that the connections having high scores contribute more to the score of the node to which it is connecting. PageRank and HITS are the variants of the eigenvector centrality measure and have been widely used in graph-based WSD [Jain et al. 2013]. In the present work, we first propose PageRank and HITS measures for fuzzy graphs and then use them for WSD using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet, which is represented as a fuzzy graph.

For fuzzy graphs, given a weight  X  ab of an edge connecting vertices v a and v b ,we propose the definition for s PageRank score for the vertex v a as where E is the set of edges in the fuzzy graph,  X  ij represents the edge strength between vertex v i and v j ,and d  X  [0 , 1] is the damping factor. Luca and Carlos [2006] advocate that taking the value of d around 0.85 gives better results, and therefore we have also taken d = 0 . 85 in this article. The initial PageRank score of each vertex is considered to be 1.

HITS is another graph-centrality algorithm that was designed for ranking Web pages according to their degree of  X  X uthority X  [Kleinberg 1999, Mihalcea and Dragmoir 2011]. HITS is similar to the PageRank algorithm; however, the main difference is that it makes a distinction between authorities and hubs. HITS [Kleinberg 1999] determines graphs, we propose the following definition for the hub and the authority values as follows: where  X  u v is the strength of an edge between node u and v . Normalized values of hub h f ( v ) and authority a f ( v ) of a vertex can be obtained by dividing the hub value (authority value) by the sum of the square root of the hub (authority) values of all nodes as given next [Gupta 2006]: 5.1.1.3. Closeness Centrality. For a classical graph, closeness centrality states that a vertex is important if it is relatively close to all other vertices [Borgatti 2006; Mihalcea and Dragmoir 2011]: in the equation is the sum of the inverse of the shortest distances between u n and all other vertices, and the denominator is the number of nodes in the graph (excluding u n ). two nodes u 0 and u n is calculated as follows [Rosenfeld et al. 1975; Sunitha 2001]: if n = 0, then  X  ( u 0 , u n ) = 0 .

The shortest distance between u 0 and u n in a fuzzy graph would be d ( u 0 , u n )and defined as
We propose the following definition for the closeness centrality of a vertex u n for a fuzzy graph as follows: The closeness centrality of a disconnected node is a small constant given by 1 | V | . 5.1.1.4. Betweenness Centrality. The intuition behind betweenness is that a node is important if it falls in a large number of paths compared to the total set of paths. Betweenness of a vertex v is calculated as the fraction of shortest paths between node pairs that pass through v [Freeman 1979; Freeman et al. 1991]: where | d ( s , t ) | represents the total number of shortest paths between s and t ,and | d v ( s , t ) | represents the number of shortest paths from s to t that pass through vertex v . For a vertex v in a fuzzy graph, betweenness centrality ( v ) can be defined as the ratio of betweenness ( v ) to maximum number of node pairs excluding v . 5.1.2. Global Measures for a Fuzzy Graph. Global connectivity measures are concerned with the structure of a graph as a whole rather than with individual nodes [Jain et al. 2013]. They are calculated on subgraphs derived from the main graph. We now propose the global connectivity measures for a fuzzy graph. 5.1.2.1. Compactness. Compactness refers to the extent of cross referencing in a graph. When compactness is high, reachability between vertices is good. A low com-pactness shows insufficient links and also indicates that parts of the network are possibly disconnected. For a graph G , compactness C ( G ) is given by Jain et al. [2013] and Botafogo et al. [1992]:
In the equation,  X  ( u ,v ) is the shortest distance between node u and node v . The value of max = max ( v  X  V v  X  V  X  ( u ,v )) is the maximum value the distance sum can assume, i.e., a completely disconnected graph. This distance sum can be approximated as max = K | V || V  X  1 | , where K =| V | for a graph. The value of min =| V || V  X  1 | ,the minimum value, i.e., a fully connected graph.

In the fuzzy graph, the distance between two neighbor nodes is taken as the inverse of the edge strength  X  [0 , 1], i.e., e = 1/ (edge strength). Assuming that the min value of the strength of any of the relations defined in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet is 0.5, the maximum distance between two neighbor nodes can be computed as 1/( min edge strength) = for a fuzzy graph remains similar to the graph, i.e., min =| V || V  X  1 | . Now we propose the following definition for compactness C f ( G ) of a fuzzy graph as follows: where the value of d ( u ,v ) can be computed using Equation (12). 5.1.2.2. Graph Entropy. Entropy measures the amount of information (uncertainty) in a random variable. In graph-theoretic terms, high entropy indicates that many vertices are equally important, whereas low entropy indicates that only a few vertices are important. Entropy in a graph is given by Alon and Orlitsky [1996]: where probability p ( v ) of a vertex v is given by the degree distribution:
We know that for fuzzy graphs, the degree of a node can be calculated as deg f ( v ) =
We define total number of edges ( | E | f ) in a fuzzy graph: where  X  u v = 0 if ( u ,v ) /  X  E .
 We propose the definition for graph entropy of a fuzzy graphs H f ( G ) as follows: where ( u ,v )  X  E, H f ( G ) provides a measure of importance of nodes in a fuzzy graph. However, H f ( G ) is not normalized. Normalized entropy for a fuzzy graph can be ob-tained by dividing H f ( G ) by the maximum entropy given by log | V | . 5.1.2.3. Edge Density. In a graph G with | V | vertices, edge density is defined as the ratio of edges in a graph to the number of edges of a complete graph [Jain et al. 2013]:
For fuzzy graphs, the number of edges is calculated by using Equation (20), i.e., by summing up the all edge strengths. So we propose the definition of edge density for a fuzzy graph G as In this section, we apply the concepts of Fuzzy Hindi WordNet and fuzzy graph connec-tivity measures proposed by us in the previous sections for WSD in the Hindi language. Recently, Jain et al. [2013] proposed a WSD method for all open-class words in the Hindi language. In this article, we hereby propose a modified WSD algorithm (Algorithm 1) using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet and fuzzy graph connectivity measures.

Initially, we build a fuzzy graph G = ( V, E ), named as sentence graph for each target sentence, by using the graph of the reference lexicon Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. Sentences are part-of-speech tagged (POS tagged), as our algorithm considers content words only, i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. As explained earlier, the vertices in a graph are word senses, and the edges represent semantic relations. Given the fuzzy graph G , for each content word w i  X  W , W represents the set of open-class words extracted from the given sentence. We select the most appropriate sense S w Hindi WordNet). We identify appropriate sense S w vertex in the graph G according to its importance, which is computed using fuzzy graph connectivity measures.

The following example demonstrates how the proposed WSD algorithm can be used for disambiguating word senses in a sentence in the Hindi language.

Example 2 . Consider the Hindi sentence  X  (kas . t . ajh  X  elakara h  X   X  camakte hai.). X  The content words are  X  ( kas . t . a ), X   X  ( jh  X  elakara ), X  and  X  (camakte). X  Therefore, W = ( ( kas . t . a n ), ( jh  X  elan  X  a v ), ( camak n )), and | W |= 3.
 For the words  X  ( kas . t . a ), X   X  ( jh  X  elakara ), X  and  X  (camakte), X  Fuzzy Hindi WordNet and Hindi WordNet list 2, 1, and 4 senses, respectively (here, the sub-script n represents a noun and the subscript v represents a verb). First we extract the base words from the content words, i.e.,  X  ( jh  X  elan  X  a ) X  for  X  ( jh  X  elakara ) X  and  X  ( camak ) X  for  X  (camakte), X  the word  X   X  remains similar. Refer to Figure 4 for a description of different meanings of the words  X  ( kas . t . a ) X  and  X  ( camak ) X  taken from Hindi WordNet. Initially, we set perform DFS taking each node in V W as a source node one by one. We take L = ing through the hypernymy/hyponymy relation. We first follow ( kas . t . a n 1 ), which is in turn connected to ( kas . t . a n 2 ); later, it is connected to ( camak n 4 ). We add traverse the Hindi WordNet graph taking ( camak n 3 ) as a source node, which is connected with ( jh  X  elan  X  a v 1 ) by two different paths { (camak n 3 ), (avasth  X  a), and { (camak n 3 ), (avasth  X  a), (ghat . an), (par  X  adhvani), (dhvani), spectively. As ( camak n 3 ), ( jh  X  elan  X  a v 1 )  X  V W , we add all intermediate nodes and edges encountered in these paths in the sentence graph. Following a similar procedure, we first construct the sentence graph (Figure 5) using Hindi WordNet and simultane-ously construct the sentence graph (fuzzy graph) (Figure 6) using Fuzzy Hindi Word-Net. Comparing these two figures, we notice that the fuzzy graph in Figure 6 shows some extra edges that represent the fuzzy entailment relation between (camak 3 n ) and (m  X  ehanata) and the fuzzy entailment relation between (m  X  ehanata) and karan  X  a) 0 After constructing sentence graphs using both Hindi WordNet and Fuzzy Hindi WordNet, we compute the local connectivity measures for both the graphs using Equa-tions (3) through (15). Table III shows the results of local connectivity measures for all vertices in the sentence graph (shown in Figure 5) constructed using Hindi WordNet. Table IV shows the results of local connectivity measures for all vertices in the sentence graph (shown in Figure 6) constructed using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet.
 Now for each interpretation of the sentence, we construct the interpretation graph. The interpretation graph is the subset of the sentence graph. For each interpretation, we construct the interpretation graph from the sentence graph constructed using Hindi WordNet (Figure 5) and also construct the interpretation graph from the sentence graph constructed (Figure 6) using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. The given sentence has three content words  X  (camaka), X   X  (kas . t . a), X  and  X  (jh  X  elan  X  a) X  for which Hindi WordNet lists 4, 2, and 1 senses, respectively.

Therefore, the given sentence has I = n i  X  1 m i = 2  X  1  X  4 = 8 interpretations. Thus, we construct G j ( V j , E j )  X  G ( V , E )(1  X  j  X  8), initializing V j , E j (1  X  j  X  8): V V V V E
We first construct the interpretation graphs using Hindi WordNet, i.e., from the sentence graph shown in Figure 5. First we construct the interpretation graph for there is no path between node pairs (camaka n 1 )and (kas . t . a n 1 ), (camaka n 1 ) terpretation graph is disconnected for interpretation ( (camaka n 1 ), (kas . t . a n 1 ), (compactness, graph entropy, edge density) are zero. Similarly, the interpretation graph constructed for the rest of the seven interpretations are also disconnected. Therefore, all global connectivity measures for all interpretation graphs are zero.

Now we construct the interpretation graph for each of these eight interpre-tations using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet, i.e., the subgraphs of the sentence graph shown in Figure 6. First we construct the interpretation graph for the interpreta-tion ( (camaka n 1 ), (kas . t . a n 1 ), (jh  X  elan  X  a)). There is no path between node pairs (camaka n 1 )and (kas . t . a n 1 ), (camaka n 1 )and (jh  X  elan  X  a), and for interpretations ( (camaka n 1 ), (kas . t . a n 2 ), (jh  X  elan  X  a)), ( (camaka n 2 ), interpretation graphs constructed are the disconnected, and thus a zero value of all global connectivity measures are obtained. For the rest of the four inter-pretations, namely ( (camaka n 3 ), (kas . t . a n 1 ), (jh  X  elan  X  a)), ( (camaka n 3 ), ( (camaka n 4 ), (kas . t . a n 2 ), (jh  X  elan  X  a)), the interpretation graphs are con-structed and shown in Figure 7(a) through (d), respectively. For the sake of brevity, we have shown the interpretation graphs only for the interpretations for which the graph constructed are not disconnected, and thus a nonzero value of global connectiv-ity measures are obtained. Table V shows the resulting values of global connectivity measures for the interpretation graphs shown in Figure 7(a) through (d) for various in-terpretations of the sentence  X  ( kas . t . ajh  X  elkar hi camakat  X  ehai ) X  using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet.

Now we compare the results for WSD of the sentence  X  ( kas . t . a jh  X  elkar hi camakat  X  e hai ) X  by using Hindi WordNet and Fuzzy Hindi WordNet.
First we discuss the results when Hindi WordNet is used. Table III shows the local connectivity measures, the degree centrality shows a tie between in-terpretations ( (camaka n 3 ), (kas . t . a n 2 ), (jh  X  elan  X  a)) and ( (camaka n 4 ), pretation ( (camaka n 4 ), (kas . t . a n 2 ), (jh  X  elan  X  a)). HITS favors interpretation the last local measure, is unable to find any conclusion. Being zero values of all global connectivity measures (using Hindi WordNet), it is not possible to give any results. Now it may be easily noted that maximum support goes in favor of the interpretation ( (camaka n 4 ) (kas . t . a n 2 ) (jh  X  elan  X  a)) using Hindi WordNet. Therefore, the fi-nal interpretation using Hindi WordNet is  X  ( dukh jh  X  elkar hi t .  X   X sa hoti hai ), X  which is a wrong interpretation.

Now we discuss the results when Fuzzy Hindi WordNet is used. All local con-nectivity measures, namely PageRank, HITS, closeness, and betweenness central-ity (except degree centrality) support interpretation ( (camaka n 3 ) (kas . t . a n 1 ) tent word  X  (camaka), X  which is correct, whereas (kas . t . a n 1 ) for the content word  X  (kas . t . a) X  with a small difference of 0.01, which may be avoided. The global connectivity measures (compactness, entropy, edge density) also favor the in-terpretation ( (camaka n 3 ) (kas . t . a n 1 ) (jh  X  elan  X  a)) (see Table V). Therefore, both the local and the global connectivity measures results in a ( (camaka n 3 ) tence  X  ( kas . t . ajh  X  elakara h  X   X  camakte hai ) X  can be written as  X  ( yantran  X  ajh  X  elkar hi vik  X  asa hota hai ), X  which is the correct interpretation. Therefore, by employing Fuzzy Hindi WordNet, we are able to find the correct interpretation of the Hindi sentence, whereas Hindi WordNet failed to identify the correct interpretation of the Hindi sentence. In this section, we first compute the time complexity of our algorithm. We also compare the performance of the proposed method by using Hindi WordNet and Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. We find that Fuzzy Hindi WordNet gives better results than Hindi WordNet. We discuss the time complexity of the proposed WSD method by using Hindi WordNet and Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. Our WSD method consists of two steps: the first is graph construction and the second is disambiguation.
 Let s be the constant that represents the highest number of senses of any word w in Hindi WordNet ( HWN )/Fuzzy Hindi WordNet ( FHWN ).
Let the sentence  X  have n words. In the associated sentence graph, the number of senses is bound by | V  X  | , where
For the sentence  X  , the graph construction procedure executes DFS from each vertex v  X  Vs . the running time for DFS from each vertex is O ( | V V FHWN ,E FHWN are the sets of vertices and edges, respectively, in the entire Fuzzy Hindi WordNet graph. The number of edges | E FHWN | can be bound by k  X | V FHWN | , where k is a constant equal to the maximum number of Fuzzy Hindi WordNet edges incident to any node in the Fuzzy Hindi WordNet graph. So the cost of a single DFS bound by sn  X  O ( n ), the overall time complexity of the graph construction phase is do not explore the entire Fuzzy Hindi WordNet graph, a DFS can take O ( n ) time. The maximum number of incident edges is a small value, and we visit the Fuzzy Hindi WordNet graph at the maximum distance  X  L .

With a local measure lm , the running time of the disambiguation phase is O ( C lm ( n )), where C lm ( n ) is the time cost incurred by lm when applied to all O ( n ) nodes in the sentence graph. Table VI shows the running times for each measure individually. It can be seen that the degree complexity amounts to O ( n ) time if we represent the sentence graph by an adjacency list. Measures of eigenvector centrality require the application of the power method, which takes O ( n 2 ) time. The time complexity of the key player problem [Johnson 1997] depends on the calculation of all shortest distances if m is the each vertex has a constant upper bound on the number of incident edges. Finally, for the betweenness local measure, researchers explain an O ( nm ) implementation [Brandes 2001].

Complexity increases when global measures are employed. Calculating the score of a edge density and graph entropy if we use an adjacency list). Exhaustively generating all possible interpretations is computationally prohibitive with O ( s n ) complexity (recall that s is the maximum number of senses for a word in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet). We can reduce the search space to a very large constant  X  using the approximation algorithms. The running time of the approximated global measures is thus polynomial.

It may be noted that representation of the Hindi WordNet and Fuzzy Hindi WordNet graphs can only be differentiated by the number of edges. For a given set of words, more words/nodes are related in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet than in Hindi WordNet. In addition to all connections/edges defined in Hindi WordNet, Fuzzy Hindi WordNet has some more additional edges representing fuzzy relations. Thus, the number of edges increase in the Fuzzy Hindi WordNet graph by a constant value as compared to the Hindi WordNet graph. The number of edges | E FHWN | is bound by k  X | V FHWN | , where k is a constant equal to the maximum number of Fuzzy Hindi WordNet edges incident to any node in the Fuzzy Hindi WordNet graph. Thus, the time complexity of the proposed WSD method increases only by a constant when Fuzzy Hindi WordNet is used in place of Hindi WordNet, and hence the order of time complexity remains the same. We evaluated our algorithm using the publicly available sense marked corpus on the IIT Bombay Web site (Center for English Language Technology 2010). Some of the sentences in the health corpus and various fuzzy relations existing between the words of the sentences are shown in Table VII. For any given system, the scorer reports precision (the number of correct senses over the number of senses returned), recall (the number of correct senses over the total number of senses identified in the evaluation dataset), and their combined F 1 measure = (2PR/(P + R)). Since our method provides an answer for all ambiguous words, precision, recall, and F 1 are the same. We report the performance for Fuzzy Hindi WordNet and Hindi WordNet. Since our method provides an answer for all ambiguous words, precision, recall, and F 1 are the same. Our results on the health corpus subset are summarized in Table VIII. We report the performance for Hindi WordNet and Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. The All column shows results on all words (monosemous and polysemous), whereas the Poly column shows results on the polysemous words subset. We compare the results by using both Hindi WordNet and Fuzzy Hindi WordNet reference lexicons one by one.

Let us first focus on the results we obtained with the standard Hindi WordNet compu-tational lexicon. From Table VIII, it can easily be seen that all local measures perform better than the global measures. Out of the local measures, degree and PageRank give better results than the other three. However, degree and PageRank give almost similar results (as can be seen in Table VIII). This is consistent with the previous results ob-tained by researchers using these two measures [Upstill et al. 2003]. Among the global measures, compactness and edge density are better than graph entropy. It can easily be seen that local measures provide better results than global measures and that all differences are statistically significant.
 We now discuss the performance of the different measures for WSD using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. It can be seen that the best local measures are degree, PageRank, and betweenness, as their values are almost similar. The best global measure is edge density, which outperforms compactness and graph entropy. However, all local mea-sures are significantly better than edge density. A reference lexicon with a large num-ber of semantic relations, i.e., a greater number of edges seems to benefit both local and global measures. Fuzzy Hindi WordNet yields better results compared to Hindi WordNet. By using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet sense inventory, the disambiguation perfor-mance increases in most cases by approximately 8%.

The health corpus contains 90 files, and each file contains approximately 100 sen-tences. The average number of open-class words in the sentences in health corpus is 8.85 (we take the nearest integer, i.e., 9). The average number of word senses for the words defined in Hindi WordNet is 3.63 (we take the nearest integer, i.e., 4). As the average word senses in Hindi WordNet is 4, the total number of word senses in the average length sentence may vary from 9 to 9  X  4 = 36. We extracted all sentences with an average word length from the health corpus and evaluated the performance of the proposed method for those sentences. Figure 8 shows the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of precision. The outcomes of the experimentations given in Figure 8 show that the proposed method is scalable for sentences having an average word length. Overall, we find that WSD can be achieved at a higher level by using Fuzzy Hindi WordNet in place of Hindi WordNet. Fuzzy Hindi WordNet represents the relations between words as a matter of degree, as most pairs of words in the real world may be partially related. We found that the relations in Hindi WordNet convey more natural representation when extended to Fuzzy Hindi WordNet. The representation of Fuzzy Hindi WordNet using fuzzy graphs provides a generalization of the relations by assigning membership degree. Further, the relations between the words that are not directly related can be inferred using com-position of fuzzy relations. The strength of composed relations can easily be computed by selecting the appropriate t -norm. We proposed and used fuzzy graph connectivity measures (both local and global) for WSD. We found that Fuzzy Hindi WordNet gives better results for WSD than that shown using Hindi WordNet. Fuzzy Hindi WordNet can provide improved results in information retrieval and query expansion, as query can be effectively processed using fuzzy relations such as fuzzy association, fuzzy hy-pernymy/hyponymy, fuzzy meronymy/holonymy, and fuzzy entailment. Since the fuzzy relations defined in Fuzzy Hindi WordNet are helpful in bringing closer more semanti-cally related words and receding away less semantically related words, it may be useful in better understanding of context while using machine translation. Since reference lexicons like WordNet exist for several languages (EuroWordNet, MultiWordNet, etc.), an interesting future direction would be to establish and evaluate the performance of extending WordNet to Fuzzy WordNet with respect to these resources. In the future, the performance of Sentiwordnet [Esuli and Sebastiani 2006] (a lexical resource based on WordNet explicitly devised for supporting sentiment classification and opinion mining) can be improved by including fuzzy relations in it. All words in Sentiwordnet are not assigned a polarity value, and the fuzzy relations and composition of fuzzy relations proposed in this article may be helpful in automatically assigning polarities to each word, which is otherwise a tedious task that requires intensive manual effort. It may be helpful in areas such as social network tracking, health, psychology, and music. Since WordNet has been used for several different purposes in information systems, including ducument classification, automatic text summarization, and to determine the similarity between words, this newly introduced idea of Fuzzy WordNet and the composition of fuzzy relations can be used in these applications in the future.
