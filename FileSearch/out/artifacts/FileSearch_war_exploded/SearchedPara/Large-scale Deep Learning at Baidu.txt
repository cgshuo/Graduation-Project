 In the past 30 years, tremendous progress has been achieved in building effective shallow classification models. Despite the success, we come to realize that, for many applications, the key bottleneck is not the qualify of classifiers but that of features. Not being able to automatically get useful fea-tures has become the main limitation for shallow models. Since 2006, learning high-level features using deep architec-tures from raw data has become a huge wave of new learn-ing paradigms. In recent two years, deep learning has made many performance breakthroughs, for example, in the ar-eas of image understanding and speech recognition. In this talk, I will walk through some of the latest technology ad-vances of deep learning within Baidu, and discuss the main challenges, e.g., developing effective models for various ap-plications, and scaling up the model training using many GPUs. In the end of the talk I will discuss what might be interesting future directions.
 I.2.6 [ Computing Methodologies ]: Artificial Intelligence X  Learning Deep Learning; Baidu Dr. Kai Yu is a Director of Engineering at Baidu. He is leading the Institute of Deep Learning (IDL), the Artificial Intelligence powerhouse of the company. Prior to the current position, he was a Senior Research Scientist at Siemens, and a Department Head at NEC Laboratories America. In 2011 he was also a Visiting Faculty at the Computer Science De-partment, Stanford University, teaching the class  X  X S121: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence X . He has published over 70 papers with H-index 32. Kai was Area Chairs at the top-tier AI conferences, including ICML and NIPS. To-gether with his co-authors, Kai has received the Best Paper Runner-up Awards at PKDD 2005 and ICML 2013. His NEC team has won several prestigious technology compe-titions, including PASCAL VOC 2009 and ImageNet 2010. Since April 2012, Kai has led a team of engineers and sci-entists at Baidu, to push the boundary of speech recogni-tion, image search, deep learning, online advertising, and music search. His team has made significant contributions to a wide range of core products, from mobile search to ad-vertising. One of his groups has been awarded the highest recognition of Baidu in 2013. He received his BS degree and MS degree in Electrical Engineering at Nanjing University, China, and a PhD degree in Computer Science at University of Munich, Germany.
