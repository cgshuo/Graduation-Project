A special issue of Information Processing and Management http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-processing-and-management/ We invite submissions for a special issue of Information Processing and Management on  X  X  X ime and Information Retrieval X  X . Motivation archives a lot of content; organizing and searching by time will only become more critical as we move forward.
This issue aims to explore opportunities and novel research on the intersection of time and information retrieval. Unlike new or powerful uses of temporality in all kinds of information systems.
 Scope &amp; Topics of Interest work that goes deeper than metadata-level time (e.g. document creation timestamp), or that does temporal analysis of document collections for, e.g., event identification, tracking and prediction, or that works on temporal-based relevancy.
Substantial, creative, articles are welcomed, according to the journal format. After submission, we envisage a smooth and on-time progression through review and toward publication of this special issue.
 We especially welcome papers on the following topics: Time as a dimension of relevance Time-aware ranking models Opinion tracking Media temporal similarity (e.g. text, video) Longitudinal analysis Document and sub-document timestamping Time as context Time-sensitive search Searching for temporal bounds Future Information Retrieval Time as a query topic Event-oriented Search Temporal web image and video retrieval Temporal clustering Collective memory and web archiving Cross-temporal information retrieval General issues In-document temporality Temporal query understanding Temporal indexing Evaluation metrics for temporal IR Visualising and presenting time Important dates CFP: April 7, 2014 Manuscript due date: September 8th 2014 Acceptance notification date: December 2nd 2014 Final manuscript due date: January 30th, 2015 (for all revisions) Publication date: Spring 2015
