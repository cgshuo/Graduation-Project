 the remaining dimensions as common and non-common. In the example above, State and Sex are target dimensions, Age is a common dimension, and Race and Education _ level are non-common dimensions.
In the previous paper mentioned above, we examined two obvious computational methods for computing such a target multiplication of the cardinalities of the non-common dimensions.
 egories and roll-up and drill-down operations are needed to generate the desired target results. 1.1. The problem To explain the idea let us consider the following multiple primary databases: DB PR 1  X  Income  X  State ; Age  X  DB PR 2  X  Income  X  State ; Labor status  X  DB PR 3  X  Income  X  Age ; Labor status  X 
DB PR 4  X  Income  X  State ; Age ; Labor status  X  and multiple proxy databases: DB PX 1  X  Population  X  State ; Age ; Sex  X  DB PX 2  X  Population  X  State ; Labor status ; Sex  X  DB PX 3  X  Population  X  Age ; Labor status ; Sex  X 
DB PX 4  X  Population  X  State ; Age ; Labor status ; Sex  X  gories of Labor status are In _ Labor _ Force and Not _ in _ Labor _ Force according to US Census Bureau. we select the first primary database, i.e., Income(State, Age ), then we can apply DB choose the second primary database, we can only apply DB PX 1 data on dimensions State and Sex , which are provided by DB tion results. the primary database provides more accurate results. In Case 1 and Case 2 , DB 1.2. Related work consider a set of proxy (or auxiliary) databases, which share the same summary measures.
In [5] the authors propose a framework for approximate answers to aggregation queries called online aggregation in which the base data is scanned in random order at query time and the approximate answer is continuously updated as the scan proceeds. The approximate query answering (AQUA) [1] system provides approximate answers using small abases from multiple summary databases.

 2. Principles and formal model 2.1. Principles of entropy sections. The (Shannon) entropy H of a discrete probability distribution p  X  x  X  is the non-negative function least as great as that of all other members of a specified class of distributions.
Let P  X  X 1 ; ... ; X n  X  be an n -dimensional discrete probability distribution to be estimated from P of rows and columns in the  X  X  X argins X  of a table). If X  X f X all marginal probability distributions such that it satisfies the following constrains: every element in P  X  X  X  is non-negative value P P  X  X  X  X  1 P  X  X i  X  X  P i  X  X i  X 
Note that in this paper, we will refer to the constraints mentioned above as the consistency conditions . Let and P  X  X  X  measures the similarity of two distribution and is defined as follows: estimate is Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure -IPFP [4], which starts with the zero approximation P mines the higher-order approximations to P  X  X  X  according to the following computation scheme: where the approximation P  X  hn  X  i  X  X  X  in the  X  h  X  1  X  -th iteration cycle, 1
P  X  hn  X  i 1  X  X  X  to the marginal distribution P i  X  X i  X  as follows:
This procedure converges monotonically to the maximum entropy estimation. The iterations stop when the estimate at two consecutive steps are the same or the difference of estimates are less than a pre-defined value. 2.2. Formal model ing sections, we assume two source summary databases, called DB
The databases are defined as follows: DB P  X  M P A i P 0 &lt; i where M P ; M Q , and M T are the measures of the corresponding databases, A mary databases, one of the measures, either M P or M Q is selected. Without loss of generality, suppose that M Thus, M P  X  M T . DB P is called the primary database , M Given two source summary databases DB P and DB Q that are used to generate a target database DB common otherwise. Note that a target dimension can exist in both source databases. We use the following notation: DB dimension-groups, respectively. Note that A C P  X  A C Q , and A

A T  X f State g is the target dimension, where A where the summary query expressed over the source databases is Income(State, Age ), then A A 3.

 with the target database is selected. For the databases shown in Table 2 , the largest entropy is achieved by DB the primary database is selected.
 The relative entropy (or loss of information) of the estimates by applying each primary database to DB primary databases. Thus, the combination of DB PR 4 and DB given in Section 5.

In this example, the proxy is DB PX 4 approximation should be set to P  X  S ; A ; L  X  , but this proxy is not provided. Our solution is to estimate the zero approximation is defined by the aggregation over Sex of database in the same set. They are not considered in the database selection because they are redundant. 4.

 Proof. Let the relative entropy of b M P k A T C P ; A T C defined according to the following expressions: We show D b M P l ; M P D b M P k ; M P &gt; 0 as follows: Setting Similar to Theorem 4.1 , P FG log G &gt; 0 is shown.

To summarize the discussion above, the procedure for determining the steps to achieve maximum accuracy can be the proxy database which includes maximum common dimensions with the primary databases. h 5.

We focus first on Group 1 of proxy databases and apply the F method for running the IPFP procedure. Accordingly, b vergence and the relative execution time are shown in Table 9 .
 Then, we apply the PP method. In this case, we pre-aggregate first the dimensions Age and Race in DB 0.207456 vs. 0.207466, (see Table 8 , fourth column).
 order to apply the PP method, we need to pre-aggregate Age in DB DB DB PX 2 , and DB PX 3 , and it consists of one iteration.
