 An aggregated search interface is designed to integrate search results from different sources (web, image, video, blog, etc) into a single result page. This paper presents two user stud-ies investigating factors affecting users click-through behav-ior on aggregated search interfaces. We tested two aggre-gated search interfaces: one where results from the different sources are blended into a single list (called blended ), and another, where results from each source are presented in a separate panel (called non-blended ). A total of 1,296 search sessions performed by 48 participants were analysed in our study. Our results suggest that 1) the position of search results is significant only in the blended and not in the non-blended design; 2) participants X  click-through behavior on videos is different from other sources; and finally 3) cap-turing a task X  X  orientation towards particular sources is an important factor for further investigation and research. H.5 [ INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESEN-TATION ] Human Factors, Measurement Aggregated search, result presentation, task-based user study, click-through behavior, blended and non-blended designs
Aggregated search interfaces are now a common paradigm for search result presentation. An aggregated search inter-face is designed to integrate search results from different sources (web, image, video, news, blog, tweet, etc) into a single result page. An objective of aggregated search is to facilitate the access to the increasingly diverse content avail-able on the web. There appears to be at least two main types of integration; blended and non-blended . A blended inte-gration (as initiated by Google Universal Search 1 , and now used by many other search engines) presents results from different sources within a single ranked list, whereas a non-blended integration (e.g., Alpha Yahoo! 2 or Naver 3 )presents results from each source in a separate panel.

Although a large number of studies devoted to the de-sign and evaluation of conventional web search interfaces have been reported in the literature (e.g. [8, 22, 23]), less is known about aggregated search interfaces. The main as-pect distinguishing an aggregated search interface from a conventional one is that results from different sources are integrated within the default web search results. This in-creases the complexity in the design of search interfaces and result presentation. This distinction raises two main issues: 1. How should we determine the relevance of a source to 2. How should we organise the search results with multi-
There have been several studies looking at the first issue e.g. [17, 20, 19]. On the other hand, research on the second issue in the context of aggregated search interfaces is still limited. To examine the second issue, we carried out two user studies: one using a blended design and another using a non-blended design. The objective of our studies was to investigate the impact of factors on people X  X  click-through behavior on the aggregated search result presentation. The factors we studied included position of search results, source types, and strength of search task X  X  orientation towards a particular source type.

We elaborate on the last factor. An important task of an aggregated search system is to determine, for a given query, not only whether a document is relevant, but from which sources relevant documents should be retrieved. To capture this aspect, we introduce the notion of the  X  X ource orientation X  of an information need to refer to the degree to which documents from a specific source would be rele-vant to complete the corresponding search task. It should http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/05/universal-search-best-answer-is-still.html au.alpha.yahoo.com/ www.naver.com/ be emphasised that it was not the aim of this work to study how to select the sources from which documents should be retrieved. Instead, given that we know the source orienta-tion of an information need, we aim to investigate the effect of this on users click-through behavior. Source-orientation can be seen as a dimension of relevance [3], one necessary to investigate aggregated search.

To summarise, the work reported in this paper is con-cerned with the effect of the source orientation of an infor-mation need, the positioning of search results, and source types on users click-through behavior. We study these ef-fects for both bended and non-blended aggregated search interfaces.
This subsection defines the research questions investigated in our study. In this paper, we refer to conventional web search results as the base elements of aggregated result pre-sentation, and those from all other sources such as images, videos, and news, as augmented elements .
 R1 How does the position of augmented elements affect users X  R2 How does the source orientation of an information need R3 How does the effect of position and source orientation
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The experi-mental design to address our research questions is described in Section 2. Section 3 reports the results from our studies and their analyses, whereas Section 4 contains a discussion of our findings. Related work is presented in Section 5. Finally, we finish with conclusions and future work in Section 6.
To investigate the factors affecting click-through behavior in aggregated search interfaces, we carried out two sepa-rate within subject studies with 48 participants (24 using a blended interface design and 24 using a non-blended one). It should be emphasised that it was not the aim of this work to compare the performance of blended and non-blended in-terfaces, but instead to make separate observations for each. Since these two main approaches to aggregating results exist (blended and non-blended), we tested the factors for both approaches.

Research reported in [19] and [20] showed that the typi-cal pattern with multiple-sources (in terms of click-through and relevance) was that at most two sources are involved, with the conventional web source being highly predominant. As a consequence, in this paper only the aggregation of two sources (conventional web and one other source) is consid-ered at any one time. In addition, we chose image, news and video as the non-web sources, as these were some of the most frequently used sources in existing aggregated search interfaces.

The factors examined in our study were represented by three independent variables: position, source of the aug-mented elements, and the source orientation of the search task. Each variable had three levels, as listed below: 1. Position (P): 2. Augmented Element (AE): Image, News and Video. 3. Source-Orientation (SO): High, Medium and Low.
To measure the effect of the independent variables on users click-through behavior, we proposed two dependent variables: the frequency of clicks on augmented elements, and the ratio of those clicks that are bookmarked by partic-ipants. Our participants were asked to bookmark the search results perceived to be needed to complete the search tasks.
Deciding which interface positions augmented elements could be placed and thus examined in this study was not trivial. There are many possible combinations in both the blended and non-blended interface designs. Based on the observations of existing aggregated search interfaces, we de-cided to focus on the positions listed above, with further examination of other positions left for future work.
For both (blended and non-blended) studies, we used the same experimental design, unless otherwise stated. That is, the same number of participants, the same search tasks and topics, the same duration of experiments, and the same questionnaires. The same search results were shown on both interfaces.
Two separate aggregated search interfaces were designed, one for each type of aggregation. A blended interface (Fig-ure 1) was used to study the factors affecting blended ag-gregation, and a non-blended interface (Figure 2) was used to investigate the factors affecting non-blended integration.
Each interface contained a fixed set of search results, one set for each of the twenty seven topics used in the exper-imented (we describe in the next section the search tasks and topics). Participants were shown one result page at a time, one for each topic. All the search results were fetched prior to the experiment, so that all participants were pre-sented with the same set of results for a given topic. We used the Yahoo! search API to fetch the results using the topic texts as queries. For each query, the results fetched corresponded to the top 10 results from the conventional web, and the top 5 from each of the other three sources. We kept the same ranking of results within each source (no re-ranking was performed). The only difference between the blended and non-blended interfaces was the organisation of the results (i.e. their positions on the interface).
For a given topic, the interface was set to display the cor-responding result page showing 15 items from two selected sources. These items were fixed and were the same for all participants. The result page showed 10 results from the conventional web (base elements) and five from the non-web source (augmented elements). These sizes are similar to typical aggregated interfaces. The positions of the aug-mented elements (image, news and video) were varied; at the top, the middle and the bottom of the web results in the blended interface, and left, top-right and bottom-right in the non-blended interface. The base and the augmented elements were not merged 4 in our blended design. This is the strategy adopted by most current search engines (with the sources used in our study), and avoids the need to de-vise a merging algorithm, and consider its effect on users click-through behavior.

Since three positions were to be tested in both interfaces, this resulted in three panels for the non-blended design. To use the same number (2) of sources in both studies, two pan-els were used to display, respectively, the base elements and the augmented elements; the third panel was kept empty. To distinguish between the three panels, the empty panel had a light background colour (see Figure 2). Questions in the exist questionnaire checked whether participants were dis-tracted or disturbed by the presence of the coloured panel. It was found that 98% of the participants did not notice the coloured panel. Those who did (2%) confirmed that the colour did not distract them. Therefore, we can assume that the coloured panel did not lead to any biased observations for the non-blended design.
Since our experimental design had three independent vari-ables (position, source of the augmented elements, and source orientation of the search task) and each variable had three levels, we formulated one search task (a topic and a task de-scription) for each combination of these variables (3  X  3 27) as shown in Table 1. This led to a total of twenty-seven search tasks.

The degree of source orientation of a task was determined according to our intuition. For instance, we speculated that a highly video-oriented search task was one where some vi-sual learning would be highly desirable (e.g. dance steps, aerobic movements). A mediumly video-oriented search task was one where we assumed that video results may or may not be required; e.g. for the topic  X  X aking pancakes X , some par-ticipants might prefer reading a recipe rather than watching avideo.

For each topic, participants were shown the search results
In search engine terminology, we slotted them at three dif-ferent positions on the result page (top, middle and bottom). Table 1: Position and source orientation combi-nations for each source. For blended P 1 =top, P =middle and P 3 =bottom. For non-blended P =left, P 2 =right-top and P 3 =right-bottom. Here, each cell (combination c n ) is tested for three sources, image, video and news. Thus leading to twenty-seven combinations.
 Figure 3: Example of a bookmarked page, showing web page with an extra feedback bar at the top of the page, which allowed the users to mark the result as relevant or not relevant. associated with that topic, displayed in the blended or the non-blended design. Participants were asked to bookmark those results they judged useful in completing the task (see Figure 3). A brief task description for each topic was pro-vided, which did not refer to the source orientation of the corresponding task (e.g. words such as photo, image, video, were not used). For instance, for the topic salsa dance ,the task description provided was  X  X rovide examples of dance steps X  .

The twenty-seven topics were distributed into three ses-sions. Each session was composed of all search tasks with the same level of source orientation: high, medium or low. What then varied in each session were the source of the augmented elements (3) and the position of the augmented elements (3), leading to (3  X  3) 9 topics per session (as seen in Table 1).

Every result page was timed for two minutes and partic-ipants were asked to spend it in their usual search manner. That is, participants could view all  X  X ifteen X  results if they wished or just  X  X ne X  result within the two minute time pe-riod. On average each session lasted for 18-20 minutes (2 minutes each for 9 topics). The sessions were rotated to minimise learning effects, and ordering effects were reduced by allowing participants to select the topics in random order within each session.
The experiment for the blended integration was carried out by 18 males and 6 females from the University of Glas-gow, of which 16 were graduates, 7 postgraduates and 1 an undergraduate. The experiment for the non-blended inte-gration was carried out by 18 males and 6 females, of which 1 was a graduate, 21 were postgraduates and 2 were under-graduates. To prevent any learning effect or biases, partici-pants from one study were not involved in the second study. Participants in each study did all twenty-seven topics, thus leading to a total of (27  X  24  X  2) 1296 sessions.
The participants were from various educational fields, e.g. computing, law, life sciences, real estate, aerospace, busi-ness management, arts and commerce. Participants were recruited through an email distributed to several mailing lists. An entry questionnaire was used to capture partic-ipants X  profile and search background. As the experiment was divided into three sessions, post-session questionnaires were used to capture subjective assessments on the sessions and tasks. Exit-questionnaires provided participants X  per-ceptions of sessions and tasks as a whole. Participants were rewarded fifteen pounds (GBP) for their participation. This section presents the results of our experiments. In Section 3.1, we present the overall results of the main and interaction effects of position, task source orientation, and augmented element type on users click-through behavior. We then look into the details of each of the independent variables in Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, respectively. Finally we present the result of participants X  perceptions of the aug-mented elements in Section 3.5.
We first looked at the overall frequency with which aug-mented elements are clicked for the two designs of aggre-gation. The results are shown in Table 2, which shows the total number of clicks on each augmented element, the per-centage with which augmented elements were clicked com-pared to the web results, the mean number of augmented click-throughs per session, and the percentage of clicked aug-mented elements which were also bookmarked. The bottom row of the table shows that the total number of clicks on the augmented elements was comparable between the blended and non-blended designs (978 and 1039). The ratio of the clicks was also found to be comparable (denoted as % Click in Table 2). This is perhaps unsurprising since the set of pre-sented results was the same, the only difference being their organisation. When we look at the click frequency across the augmented element types, again no large difference was observed within each type of aggregation, as well as across the two types of aggregation. These results suggest that the studies of the blended and non-blended designs are compa-rable in our analysis of click-through frequency.
A noticeable difference, however, was the ratio of book-marked results over those clicked (denoted as % Bookmark in Table 2). Participants were asked to bookmark the re-sults when they were perceived to be relevant to the search tasks. The bottom row of the table suggests that partic-ipants bookmarked the clicked results more frequently in the blended design than the non-blended design. This sug-gests that, overall, participants performed 10% better in the blended design than non-blended in finding perceived rel-evant documents from the augmented elements. While the performance is not the focus on this paper, this could be con-sidered as an advantage of the blended design. For the rest of this paper, however, we mainly report the click-through frequency results, due to space limitations.
The next analysis performed looked at the significance of the effect of the three independent variables such as; Posi-Image 360 33.7 1.7 (1.72) 53.6 410 37.3 1.9 (1.28) 41.5 Video 324 34.4 1.6 (1.48) 63.6 339 33.0 1.6 (1.21) 58.4 News 294 30.1 1.4 (1.59) 46.9 290 28.6 1.3 (1.39) 33.4 All 978 32.8 1.6 (1.60) 54.9 1039 33.1 1.6 (1.31) 44.8 Table 3: Statistical significance (p-values) of the main and interaction effects of the position (P), Source-Orientation (SO), and Augmented Element type (AE) on the click-through ratio.
 tion (P), Source-Orientation (SO), and Augmented Element type (AE), on participants X  click-through behavior. ANOVA tests were used to examine the significance of three main ef-fects (P, SO, AE), three interaction effects of two factors (PxSO, PxAE and SOxAE), and one interaction effect of three factors (PxSOxAE).

The raw click-through frequencies were first converted into ratios (click-through frequency on augmented element/total click-through frequency) before performing the ANOVA test. When the difference was found to be significant among the levels of independent variables, we further performed multi-ple post-hoc tests to find significant pairs among the factor levels. We ran multiple t-tests in the post-hoc analysis while adjusting the p-values using the Bonferroni method, where the critical value was set to 0.05/number of multiple com-parisons.

The overall ANOVA results are given in Table 3, which shows the p-value of the tests. The significant effects are highlighted with bold. It can be seen that the position effect was found to be significant in the blended design but not in thenon-blendeddesign.Theeffectofthesourceorientation and augmented element types was found to be significant in both designs of aggregation. This suggests that some factors affected click-through behavior in only one of the aggrega-tion designs, while other factors affected both designs.
Furthermore, an interaction between the position and aug-mented element type was found to be significant only in the blended design, while an interaction effect between the source orientation and augmented element type was found to be significant in both designs. This indicates that partic-ipants X  click-through behavior was not affected by a single factor but by a combination of multiple factors. Finally, the bottom row of Table 3 shows that there was a significant in-Table 4: Blended: Click-through frequency across different positions.
 teraction of the three factors on participants X  click-through behavior.

These results are helpful in presenting a high-level overview of the ANOVA tests. The following subsections will discuss these results in greater detail.
Our first research question [ R1 ] considered the effect of the augmented elements X  position on users X  click-through be-havior. We will show the result of the blended design first (Section 3.2.1), followed by the non-blended design (Section 3.2.2), and finally, a comparison between the two designs is discussed as summary (Section 3.2.3).
As we saw in the previous section, the position had a sig-nificant effect on participants X  click-through behavior in the blended design. Table 4 shows the breakdown of the click-through frequency based on the three levels of positions (i.e., top, middle, and bottom). The overall mean click frequency (row  X  X ll X  in Table 4) shows that there is a position effect between the top and middle/bottom positions, but less so between the middle and bottom positions. We performed multiple comparisons to test that the differences observed were significant. These post-hoc tests revealed that differ-ences between the top and middle, and top and bottom po-sitions were significant (Table 5). This suggests that partici-pants clicked the augmented elements more frequently when they were located at the top of the results than the other positions.
Unlike the blended design, the position effect was found to be insignificant in the non-blended design. The breakdown of the click-through frequency based on the position of the non-blended design can be found in Table 6. As can be seen from the bottom row of the table, the overall frequency was similar across the position levels. On the other hand, there appears to be some difference among the augmented source types, which will be discussed in Section 3.4.2. Table 5: Multiple t-tests (p-value) on position com-binations in blended design Table 6: Non-Blended: Click-through frequency across different positions.
 Image 2.0 (1.36) 1.8 (1.21) 1.9 (1.27) Video 1.6 (1.17) 1.5 (1.21) 1.6 (1.26)
To summarise, our results for research question one [ R1 ] suggest that there is a significant position effect on users X  click frequency in the blended interface, whereas in the non-blended interface, the position of augmented elements does not seem to affect users X  click frequency.
The second research question [ R2 ] looks at the effect of the source orientation of an information need on users X  click-through behavior. The order of the experimental results is the same as Section 3.2.
As we saw in Table 3, the source orientation was found to be significant in the blended design. The breakdown of the results based on the three levels of the orientation is shown in Table 7. As can be seen from the bottom of the table, the click-through frequency decreases as the level of source orientation weakens. The post-hoc tests show that the differences between the high level and middle level, and between the high level and low level, are significant (second column of Table 8). This suggests that participants clicked the augmented results more frequently when an information need has a strong orientation towards a particular informa-tion source type, in the blended design.
Like the blended design, participants X  click-through fre-quency was also significantly affected by the source orien-tation in the non-blended design. The breakdown of the results based on the three levels of orientation in the non-Table 7: Blended: Click-through frequency across different source orientation levels.
 Table 8: Multiple comparison for source orientation combinations on click-through frequency.
 Table 9: Non-Blended: Click-through frequency across different source orientation levels.
 blended design is shown in Table 9. Again, the frequency appears to decrease as the level of orientation weakens. The post-hoc tests show that the differences between the high level and medium level, and between the high level and low level, are significant (third column of Table 8). This sug-gests that participants clicked the augmented results more frequently when the task X  X  source orientation was high in the non-blended design.
As we have seen, the effect of the source orientation was found to be equally significant in both the blended and non-blended design. The standard deviation in the bottom row of Tables 7 and 9 suggests that this trend is slightly more con-sistent in the non-blended design than the blended design. However, in terms of the frequency, the results are compara-ble. This suggests that the effect of the source orientation is an important factor to be investigated in aggregated search research.
Our last research question [ R3 ] aims to investigate the interaction effect between the augmented source types and the position or source orientation. We were interested to see if the interaction effect of factors such as position and source orientation vary, or were similar across augmented elements. To answer this question we comp ared the click-through data from image, video and news results across different levels of position and source orientation. For each interface, we first report results for the interaction effect of position and augmented elements (PxAE), and then we present results for the interaction of source orientation and augmented element (SOxAE). Finally, we compare the interaction effect between the two aggregation designs.
Returning to Table 3 again, we can see that the inter-action effect of position and augmented element (PxAE) is significant in the blended interface (fifth row of Table 3). This suggests that participants X  click-through behavior was affected by a combination of the two factors. To understand this effect better, we plotted an interaction plot using the position and augmented elements. The result is shown in Figure (a) in Table 10.

The interaction plot shows that the pattern of videos is different from images and news. The post-hoc tests show that, at the middle position, participants clicked video re-sults more frequently than images or news results (See Table (a) in Table 10).

Next, results from the ANOVA tests suggest that the in-teraction effect of source orientation and augmented element (SOxAE) is another significant factor affecting user X  X  click-through behavior in the blended design (sixth row of Table 3). The interaction plot of the two factors is shown in Figure (a) of Table 11. Again, the pattern of video results appears to be different from images and news results. The post-hoc tests show that, at the middle level of source orientation, participants clicked the video results more frequently than the other sources in the blended design (See Table (a) of Table 11).
For the non-blended design, an interaction effect of po-sition and augmented element type (PxAE) was not found to be significant. As can be seen from the interaction plot shown in Figure (b) of Table 10, all sources show a similar pattern.

On the other hand, participants X  click-through frequency was affected significantly by the interaction effect of the source orientation and augmented element types (SOxAE). The interaction plot of the two variables is shown in Figure (b) of Table 11. As can be seen from the plot, the video results again have a different pattern from the image and news results. While the significant effect was found only in the middle level of source orientation in the blended design, the non-blended design have significant effects in the high and low levels of orientation, too (See Table (b) of Table 11).
A highlight of the above analysis is the difference in the click behaviour for video results, compared to news and im-age. We observed multiple cases where the frequency pat-tern of videos differed from that of images and news. Videos tended to have a low frequency even when the position was high or source orientation was high. On the other hand, participants tended to click video results more frequently than the other sources when the position was middle or the orientation was middle.

We will discuss the implications of this finding in Sec-tion 4.
Recall that our experimental design had three sessions (Section 2) with each session corresponding to one level of source orientation (high, medium and low). After each ses-sion, participants were asked to provide their preferred po-sition for the augmented elements on the result page. More specifically, participants were asked if they prefer to view non-web results (image, news, etc.) at the top, middle or bottom of the result page for the blended interface, and left, top-right or bottom-right of the result page for the non-blended interface. We now present the results from the ques-tionnaires for both the blended and non-blended studies.
The questionnaire results are shown in Figure 4. Results from the blended interface study suggest that for highly ori-ented sessions users prefer to have augmented results on the top. Users tended to get less specific and their preferences Figure 4: Blended: User preference on position of augmented elements across source orientations. becomes mixed when the source orientation decreases. This is consistent with our findings from the click data where a clear position effect was observed on users X  click-through behavior (Section 3.2.1)
For the non-blended interface, results show that user pref-erences are mixed when considering the position of aug-mented results for different orientations (Figure 5). Also, many users suggested that since they were able to see all the panels (base and augment elements) on the screen with-out having to scroll, the position of the panels did not mat-ter. Again, this is consistent with our findings from the click data analysis, where position was not significant for the non-blended interface (Section 3.2.2), although there is a trend for users to prefer the top-right position for the display of non-web results.
 Figure 5: Non-Blended: User preference on position of augmented elements across source orientations.
Our work was motivated by the prominent complexity of aggregated search interfaces compared to the conventional single-source design. Despite the complexity, there has been a limited number of studies look ing at the effects of factors such as augmented elements X  positions, source types, and the search tasks source orientation, on people X  X  search behavior.
As we mentioned earlier, it was not our intention to decide which type of aggregation is more effective than the other. Instead, we were interested in understanding the characteris-tics of both designs so that we can leverage their advantages depending on the context of system use. The following dis-cusses the main findings of our study and their implications on the design of aggregated search interfaces.

Our first finding is that the factors that affect partici-pants X  click-through behavior differ between the blended and non-blended designs. This may sound obvious, however this should not be underestimated, since it suggests that the way in which we present results from different sources indeed matters. For example, participants X  click-through behav-ior was significantly affected by the position of augmented elements in the blended design, echoing the findings of pre-vious studies [9, 10, 13, 15], yet not in the non-blended de-sign. This suggests that we need a careful estimation of the relevance of augmented elements with respect to the base elements when the blended design is employed. When we cannot afford to measuring the relevance of augmented el-ements, the non-blended design is more appropriate since participants X  click-through behavior was not affected by the position in this type of aggregation. Such a situation may arise in digital libraries and elsewhere. These results address our first research question [ R1 ]
The second finding is that videos resulted in a different click-through pattern from news and images. This trend was common in both the blended and non-blended designs. This suggests that, when deciding to retrieve videos, dif-ferent behavior from other sources may be observed. Or more generally, our study suggests that participants X  click-through behavior can be different across source types. These observations address our third research question [ R3 ]
While it is not entirely clear why videos are different, it is possible to suggest some possible reasons. First, videos are multimodal media [16] combining text, images, and au-dio in a dynamic way. The dynamism and multimodality of the information source might cause a user to give a different priority to videos during a search task. The different prior-ity may cause the different click-through pattern of videos when compared to news and images. Secondly, it may be due to the type of surrogate used to represent videos results, being less informative of the contents of the video than the equivalent image or text representations. The title of news articles and the thumbnail of an image can provide a good indication of the respective content of the documents. On the other hand, although basic metadata of the videos were presented, this may not have been as informative of the con-tents. This difficulty in getting the preview of videos might cause the different click-through pattern [11]. It should be noted that, the task time limit of 2 minutes did not seem to discourage users from viewing video results.

The third finding was that a search task X  X  orientation towards a particular source can affect participants X  click-throughbehavior. Thistrendwascommontoboththe blended and non-blended designs. Traditional information retrieval research has been focused on the modelling of the-matic (or topical) relevance of documents. However, re-search on XML document retrieval [14] and geographic infor-mation retrieval (GIR) [6] has demonstrated that relevance can be multidimensional, there being a structural relevance in XML retrieval, and geographic relevance in GIR, which can be considered apart from the thematic relevance. In a similar way, our experimental design controlled the level of orientation towards a particular source (i.e., news, images, and videos). The significant effect of the source orientation observed in our experiments suggests that the task X  X  source Image-Video 0.0001 0.0028 0.2394 Image-News 0.8904 0.0006 0.0000 News-Video 0.0011 0.0000 0.0045 orientation is an important factor to investigate in research on aggregated search. On the design level, it suggests that devising a means of capturing a searcher X  X  intent about the source is an important problem to tackle. These observa-tions address our second research question [ R2 ]. Finally, we should clarify the limitations of this study. First, we generated a priori the results to be displayed on the interfaces. Although this made the investigation fair, the implications of our results is limited to this particular set of search results. Second, to reduce the complexity and duration of the experiment, we tested only three sources; image, video and news. Finally, we used only a single search engine throughout our experiments. Therefore, our findings may not apply to different environments. Further studies should be carried ou t to deepen our unde rstanding of aggre-gated search interfaces. Also, we did not make any attempt to ensure that the documents retrieved by the search en-gine were relevant to the tasks, to ensure that the presented results were representative of real world search engine per-formance. However, as the ratio of bookmarked documents over all clicked documents suggests, participants did per-ceive some of the retrieved documents as relevant in order to complete the search tasks. Furthermore, one of the au-thors of this paper was there to deal with any technical prob-lems during the experiment, and we did not observe cases where participants were deliberately bookmarking clearly ir-relevant documents. Therefore, we assert that the backend engine did retrieve relevant documents and participants were able to find some of them although we did not perform any quality control of retrieval.
The usefulness of aggregated search systems has already been validated in a number of studies. For example, [17] showed the positive effect (in relevance ranking) of properly integrating news within web results using a blended design, [19] showed through a log analysis that users access docu-ments from various sources within the same search session, and [18] demonstrated through a user study the effectiveness of aggregated search for non-navigational queries.
Aggregated search can be compared to federated search [12], metasearch [7] and distributed information retrieval [5], which are all concerned with the retrieval of documents from several sources (e.g. digital libraries, search engines, special-ist collections, etc.). Aggregated search can be seen as an alternative, where results from the conventional web, ver-ticals of the same search engine, and other sources (such as Tweeter and Facebook) covered by that same search en-gine are retrieved. In aggregated search, the sources have a more distinctive nature (e.g. image vs. text, compared to dis-tributed text collections more common in federated search). In addition, for a large percentage of queries, relevant re-sults mostly come from the conventional web. However, for an increasing number of queries (e.g. person, red car), results from other sources (the augmented elements in aggregated search) are relevant, and thus could be added to the standard web results (base elements). This raises two main issues, as discussed in the introduction, the relevance of the sources, and the position of the augmented elements.

Recent work has looked at identifying and/or predicting the relevance of a source to a given query [17, 20, 18]. Our paper is concerned with the second issue, more precisely, with the impact of the relevance of the sources on user be-havior. Nonetheless, this previous work has influenced some of the design of our study, e.g. the number of sources to be considered at any one time.

Significant efforts have been devoted to the design and evaluation of conventional web search interfaces.  X  X dvanced X  factors such as interface attractiveness [8] and result trust-worthiness [22] have been evaluated. A taxonomy of result presentation techniques has been proposed as a reference for designers of web search systems [23]. However, there is still little understanding of what makes a well-designed, attrac-tive, trustworthy and engaging aggregated search interface. This paper provides some initial insights, by looking at basic factors, such as position, source and source relevance, and their effect on users X  click-through behavior.

Studies, e.g. log analysis and eye-tracking experiments, which look at the effect of result position in the context of conventional web search, are not new. For instance, [13] showed that when results were placed relatively low in the result page, people spent more time searching and were less successful in their search task. Similar behavior is likely to be observed with aggregated search interfaces; however, it remains interesting to see the effect of source orientation on this. This has motivated us to investigate the position effect across results from different sources.
Aggregation is an emerging paradigm in search result pre-sentation, which has many unexplored questions. We tested two aggregated search interfaces: one where results from the different sources are blended into a single list ( blended ), and the other, where results from each source are presented in a separate panel ( non-blended ). A total of 1,296 search sessions performed by 48 participants were analysed. Our studies led to three main findings. First, the position of search results was only significant for the blended interface. Second, participants X  click-through behavior on videos was different compared to other sources. Finally capturing a task X  X  orientation towards particular sources is an important factor to consider when considering the use of an aggregated search design.

These findings led us to formulate new research questions for future work:  X  X ow can we accurately incorporate the user behavior into retrieval models when the behavioral pat-terns differ across the source types? X ,  X  X ow will the click-through pattern on augmented elements change as the num-ber of aggregated sources increase? X , and  X  X hat kind of in-teraction design will help us capture a user X  X  source prefer-ence of an information need? X .
