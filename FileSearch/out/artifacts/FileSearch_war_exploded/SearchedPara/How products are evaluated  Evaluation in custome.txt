 Hang Su 1 Abstract This study, drawing on insights from the Appraisal framework, the parameter-based approach to evaluation and corpus linguistics, investigates the evaluative language used in customer review texts. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a framework of evaluation that can be used to account adequately for evaluative expressions in customer review texts, and the ultimate goal is to support the argument that the modelling and theorising of evaluation is context-specific. Based on the investigation into a corpus compiled of review texts retrieved from www.amazon.co.uk , this study proposes a data-driven, parameter-based and appraisal-informed framework of evaluation which comprises four parameters X  Quality, Satisfactoriness, Recommendability and Worthiness. Since these parameters are not thought-up, but are generalised from real data, it is argu-able that the proposed framework of evaluation is certainly valid and thus can be used to describe and analyse evaluative language used in this particular context. This in turn indicates that the description and theorising of evaluation is indeed highly dependent on the discourse type that is under examination.
 Keywords Appraisal Parameters Corpus linguistics Evaluative language Customer review texts This study, drawing on insights from the Appraisal framework and the parameter-based approach to evaluation (see Sect. 2 below), employs corpus linguistic methods to investigate the evaluative language used in customer review texts. The overarching goal of this investigation is to support the argument that the modelling and theorising of evaluative language is specific to the discourse type that is under examination. Given that the major function of customer review texts is to evaluate the products that customers have purchased, it can be reasonably confident that this type of discourse is the perfect data for the investigation of how products are evaluated. Thus, using a corpus compiled of customer review texts retrieved from www.amazon.co.uk , the present study explores how evaluative resources are employed by review writers. The exploration facilitates the establishment of a data-driven, parameter-based and Appraisal-informed framework of products evaluation. It is argued that the proposed framework of evaluation can be applied to account adequately for the evaluative expressions used in this particular context, which in turn supports this study X  X  argument that the description and theorising of evaluation is indeed highly context-specific. This section discusses the theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches that are relevant to the current investigation. The discussion focuses on the Appraisal framework (Martin 2000 ; Martin and White 2005 ), the parameter-based approach to evaluation (Lemke 1998 ; Bednarek 2006 , 2008 ) and the corpus-based approach to evaluation (Hunston 2011 ). 2.1 Appraisal The question of how evaluative meanings are expressed through linguistic resources has been increasingly addressed (e.g. Martin 2000 ; White 2002 ; Martin and White 2005 ; Bednarek 2006 ; Pounds 2010 , 2011 ; Hunston 2011 ; Thompson and Alba-Juez 2014 ). Among the various approaches to evaluation,  X  X  X t is within Systemic Functional Linguistics that the investigation of the systems of evaluative choices available to language users and of their function in discourse has been carried farthest X  X  (Thompson 2014 : 48). This refers to the APPRAISAL model (Martin 2000 ; Martin and White 2005 ) in which appraisal resources are regionalised into three major semantic systems, i.e. ATTITUDE, GRADUATION and ENGAGE-MENT. Put succinctly, ATTITUDE deals with resources that are used to construe emotions and opinions and is further divided into three subsystems X  X FFECT (the construal of emotional response), JUDGEMENT (the ethic evaluation of human character/behaviour) and APPRECIATION (the aesthetic evaluation of products and processes); GRADUATION concerns the amplification or downgrading of attitudinal meanings and how the boundaries between attitudinal categories are blurred, which are termed Force (i.e. intensity) and Focus (i.e. prototypicality) respectively; ENGAGEMENT deals with how different voices or viewpoints are positioned in texts and comprises two broad categories, i.e.  X  X onoglossia X  X  X o other voices or viewpoints are involved, and  X  X eteroglossia X  X  X ther voices or viewpoints are allowed for dialogic interaction [see Martin ( 2000 ) and Martin and White ( 2005 ) for a more detailed discussion of the APPRAISAL model; and see, for example, Bednarek ( 2006 : 32 X 35) and Hunston ( 2011 : 19 X 21) for a critical evaluation of the Appraisal framework]. Based on the brief introduction, the framework of Appraisal is presented below (see Fig. 1 ).
 The system that is most relevant to the current investigation is the subsystem of APPRECIATION in ATTITUDE, which is the focus of the following discussion. Simply put, Appreciation is concerned with the aesthetic evaluation of products and/ or processes. Three typological criteria drawn for the classification of appreciating meanings are: (1) Reaction which includes (a) Impact: does it catch our attention, and (b) Quality: does it meet our needs, (2) Composition which deals with (a) Balance: does it hang together, and (b) Complexity: is it hard to use or follow, and (3) Valuation: is it worthwhile (Martin 2000 ; Martin and White 2005 : 56). The APPRECIATION system is shown in Table 1 below.

While recognising the systematicity of APPRECIATION, it has to be pointed out that appreciating meanings, as evaluative meanings generally do, are highly dependent on the context (cf. Ngo and Unsworth 2015 ). In consequence, different researchers may well propose different semantic categories when different domains of discourses are concerned. For example, Hao and Humphrey ( 2012 ), investigating biological research articles, suggest prominence, benefit, necessity, worthiness and effectiveness as subcategories of Valuation; Macken-Horarik and Isaac ( 2014 ) suggest prominence as an additional subtype of Composition in narratives; Lee ( 2015 ) extends Valuation to include sociability valuation, maintenance valuation, salience valuation and validity valuation for analysing persuasive essays; and Hommerberg and Don ( 2015 ), based on an appraisal investigation of the discourse of wine appreciation, propose intensity and persistence as subtypes of Composition and divide Valuation into uniqueness, typicality, naturalness, affordability, location, durability, potential -to -develop and miscellaneous . This, on the one hand, shows that Appreciation is highly context-specific, and on the other hand, indicates the necessity of accommodating the APPRECIATION system to enable it to deal more effectively with appreciating resources found in a particular discourse domain.
It is worth noting that the argument has also been made in some other studies that it is necessary to accommodate the Appraisal framework (or any existing general theories of evaluation) when a particular discourse type is under examination. For example, Martin and White ( 2005 : 46) suggest that  X  X  X ur maps of feeling ... have to be treated at this stage as hypotheses about the organisation of the relevant meanings X  X ffered ... as a reference point for those with alternative classifications X  X  and they (2005: 58) further indicate that the attitudinal categories identified in the APPRAISAL model may need to be modified based on the evidence obtained in other discourses. Pounds ( 2011 ), investigating evaluative language used in the discourse of online property advertising, shows clearly that the appraisal categories of APPRECIATION need to be adapted to map out evaluative choices estate agencies use. More recently, Hommerberg and Don ( 2015 : 188) similarly draw the conclusion that  X  X  X he Appraisal framework itself is not designed to operate as a context-independent semantic framework, but as a flexible template for investigat-ing the means through which language positions its users in every context of situation X  X . The point, then, is that the Appraisal framework needs to be modified so that evaluative choices employed in a specific context by language users can be more adequately accounted for; this will be further exemplified with the current investigation. 2.2 The parameter-based approach The other theoretical framework that is relevant to the current investigation is the parameter-based approach to evaluation (e.g. Francis 1995 ; Lemke 1998 ; Bednarek 2006 , 2008 ). The advantage of adopting a parameter-based approach to evaluation is that it contributes  X  X  X o the solution of two major problems in the theory of evaluation: how to identify common aspects without too much simplification, and how to take account of complexity without making the theory as complex as the data X  X  (Bednarek 2006 : 215). This suggests that it is worthwhile to adopt a parameter-based approach to investigate the evaluative language used in a given discourse type.

One seminal work in this tradition is Lemke ( 1998 ) which identifies seven dimensions of evaluative meaning, as listed below. However, as noted in Bednarek ( 2006 : 37), these parameters are not sufficient enough to capture all aspects that are related to the phenomenon of evaluation. Bednarek ( 2006 , 2008 ) therefore proposes a more comprehensive parameter-based framework of evaluation. In short, Bednarek divides the parameters she identified into two broad categories: (1) core evaluative parameters including COMPREHEN-SIBILITY, EMOTIVITY, EXPECTEDNESS, IMPORTANCE, POSSIBILITY/ NECESSITY and RELIABILITY, and (2) peripheral parameters including EVIDENTIALITY, MENTAL STATE and STYLE [see Bednarek ( 2006 : 41 X 63) for a detailed discussion of these parameters].

Like APPRAISAL, however, while the parameters Bednarek ( 2006 ) proposes appear to be comprehensive, it has to be noted that these parameters are identified based on the analysis of a corpus of news discourse only. In consequence, the question remains to be addressed as to  X  X  X hether these parameters are in general exhaustive X  X  (Bednarek 2006 : 44). Bednarek has rightly answered the question that while these parameters are able to account for evaluation in her corpus,  X  X  X esearch into different genres might point to additional parameters of evaluation X  X  (Bednarek 2006 : 44). This indicates both the possibility and necessity of using evidence obtained in a specific discourse domain to add or simplify the parameters Bednarek ( 2006 ) has identified.

Further, compared with the Appraisal framework discussed above which is more theory-driven, the parameter-based approach is more text-or data-driven. This is consistent with Francis X  ( 1995 ) observation that  X  X  X hat is interesting ... is that these parameters are not thought up: they are generated by concordances of a single syntactic structure X  X . That is to say, the parameter-based approach to evaluation relies heavily on the corpus data; this brings in the third approach, i.e. the corpus-based approach to evaluation, into the discussion. 2.3 Corpus approaches to evaluation There has been a growing tradition to study evaluative language from a corpus linguistic perspective (e.g. Coffin and O X  X alloran 2006 ;Ro  X  mer 2008 ; Pounds 2010 ; Hunston 2011 ; Hyon 2011 ; Alcaraz-Ariza 2012 ; Almutairi 2013 ; Millar and Hunston 2015 ). For example, Coffin and O X  X alloran ( 2006 ) use corpus methods to investigate evaluation in media discourse; Ro  X  mer ( 2008 ) explores the possibility of using corpus methods (e.g. n-gram analysis) to identify automatically those expressions which are associated with evaluation in a corpus compiled of book reviews and argues that the automatic identification of evaluative expressions is not impossible (though it is not without problems either); Hunston ( 2011 ) offers both theoretical and methodological insights into the study of evaluative language from a corpus linguistic perspective. In general, what previous studies have shown is that corpus linguistic methods greatly facilitate the investigation of evaluative language. Further, as noted in Su ( 2015 ), corpus investigation does not simply add quantitative information to the description of evaluation, but more importantly, it provides linguistic evidence for supporting, challenging and refining existing frameworks of evaluation.

While corpus linguistic methods are indeed useful for the investigation of evaluation in corpora, this does not mean that corpus-based approaches to evaluative language are without limitations. Corpus linguistic investigation does have some drawbacks in studying evaluative language. For example, the restriction to form-based identification of evaluation makes it difficult to describe cases which do not have explicit evaluative lexis, i.e. invoked evaluation, let alone the description of non-linguistic attitudinal resources [see, for example, Joseph ( 2004 ), Feng and O X  X alloran ( 2012 ) and Unsworth ( 2015 ) for the discussion of non-verbal means of evaluation].

Nevertheless, it has to be noted that corpus linguistic methods do offer a way for the investigation of evaluative language in (large) corpora, which in turn provides more data for consideration and further offers the researcher an opportunity to test and/or refine existing frameworks of evaluation. The upshot of the discussion, then, is that it is both feasible and worthwhile to approach evaluative language from a corpus linguistic perspective (see also Hunston 2014 ).
 To recapitulate, this study, drawing on insights from the Appraisal framework X  Appreciation in particular, the parameter-based approach to evaluation and corpus linguistics, investigates the evaluative language used in customer review texts. The purpose of this investigation, on the one hand, is to explore how customers evaluate the products they have purchased and, on the other hand, is to support the argument that it is necessary to adapt existing general frameworks of evaluation so that evaluative language used in a specific context can be more adequately accounted for. The Corpus of Customer Review Text (henceforward CCRT) is used in this study. This corpus is compiled of 3000 customer review texts retrieved from www.amazon.co.uk and consists of approximately 700,000 tokens. All these texts are reviews about electronic products (e.g. computer, vacuum cleaner, cell phone). Customer review texts are selected because, given that the purpose of customer review is to evaluate the products that customers have purchased, customer review texts can thus be reasonably considered as a text type that is particularly rich in evaluative language associated with the evaluation of products. Accordingly, cus-tomer review texts can be said to be the ideal discourse type for the investigation of how products are evaluated. Moreover, it has been pointed out that  X  X  X he automatic identification of text evaluating attributes of products could be important for opinion-mining with respect to consumer satisfaction X  X  (Read and Carroll 2012 : 430), which indicates that the investigation of evaluative language in customer review texts is not only of linguistic interests, but also of commercial significance.
To date, customer review texts have mainly been investigated by sentiment analysts (e.g. Taboada and Grieve 2004 ; Whitelaw et al. 2005 ; Fletcher and Patrick 2005 ; Wiebe et al. 2005 ). The primary concern of sentiment analysis is the automatic annotation or analysis of appraisal expressions in naturally running texts; the importance of sentiment analysis lies in its practical applications, such as track and manage customer opinions, brand building, and market investigation.
What studies of sentiment analysis have shown is that a systematic taxonomy of evaluative meanings is necessary. Currently, most of these studies draw on insights from the appraisal classification of evaluative meanings, as proposed by Martin and his associates (e.g. Martin 2000 ; Martin and White 2005 ). For example, Taboada and Grieve ( 2004 ) explore the possibility of using the appraisal categories to enable automatic classification of evaluation; Whitelaw et al. ( 2005 ) demonstrate that the appraisal classification of attitudinal meanings is useful for sentiment analysis; Read and Carroll ( 2012 ) address the issue as to how to annotate evaluative expressions in terms of the taxonomy of evaluative meanings proposed in the APPRAISAL model and conclude that the appraisal taxonomy of evaluative meanings is useful for their task.
 However, while the appraisal classification of evaluative meanings is useful, the Appraisal framework is not context-independent and, therefore, it has to be accommodated according to the evidence obtained in a specific context, as discussed above. In addition, since  X  X  X he aim of sentiment analysis is not to achieve a perfect analysis of a text but to obtain  X  X ood enough X  coverage of a very large number of texts to get an overall sense of the evaluation therein X  X  (Hunston 2011 : 55), research of sentiment analysis has not satisfactorily produced any theoretical classification of evaluative meanings either. In other words, there is to date no such a framework of evaluation that can be used to account adequately for evaluative resources used in customer review texts and that can be used to specifically evaluate products. The present investigation seeks to bridge this gap.

To that end, the corpus tool AntConc 3.2.4 (Anthony 2012 ) is employed to explore the data. The particular function I use is the n-gram analysis. Simply put, n-grams are frequently occurring multi-word sequences (see Sect. 4 below). The search of n-grams can lead to the identification of those most typical and frequent occurring items in a specific corpus (e.g. CCRT in the present study). Since evaluative meanings  X  X  X re conveyed not only by individual words, but also by longer phrases X  X  (Stubbs 2001 : 215), it can be argued that n-grams analysis can facilitate the identification of units of evaluative meanings in specialised corpora. In fact, the usefulness of n-gram analysis in evaluation research has been exemplified, for example, by Ro  X  mer ( 2008 ) who notes that looking at larger recurring units (e.g. 4-grams in her study) is a very useful way to identify evaluative expressions in corpora.

Following Ro  X  mer ( 2008 ), I first searched the n-grams (n = 3 X 7) and then compared the n variables in CCRT, which shows that the 4-grams are most frequently associated with evaluative meanings. Accordingly, the 4-grams (see  X  X  Appendix  X  X  section) are selected as the starting point to identify the parameters that are associated with the evaluation of products, as discussed in greater detail below. This section presents the corpus analysis, aiming to propose a data-driven, parameter-based and Appraisal-informed framework of evaluation that can be used to account adequately for the evaluative language used in customer review texts. However, before moving on to present the proposed framework, a distinction emerges from corpus observation between what I shall term as expressed evaluation and associated evaluation. 4.1 Expressed evaluation versus associated evaluation As noted earlier, the present study, drawing on insights from both the Appraisal framework and the parameter-based approach to evaluation, uses corpus linguistic methods to investigate the evaluative language used in customer review texts. This indicates that the current investigation is both theory-and data-driven. The n-gram analysis was thus performed, with an aim to retrieve the data and to generalise the parameters along which the products that customers purchased are frequently evaluated.

I carefully read all the concordance lines of the top 100 4-grams. Based on concordance analysis, it is observed that 83 out of 100 4-grams either explicitly express or are indirectly associated with evaluation. The distinction is thus made between expressed evaluation and associated evaluation . This distinction is related but different from that made between inscribed and invoked evaluation in the Appraisal framework (Martin and White 2005 : 67 X 68). While expressed evaluation is quite similar to inscribed evaluation , associated evaluation is quite different from that of invoked evaluation . In appraisal, invoked evaluation refers to cases where  X  X  X t is not possible to isolate such explicitly attitudinal vocabulary X  X  (White 2011 : 18); however, the concept of associated evaluation is more text-driven X  X t refers to cases where no evaluative lexis can be found in a given 4-gram, but evaluative lexis can be found in its immediate context. For the purpose of illustration, examples (1) X (4) are given below. 1. the size of it. The remote_ is easy to use and for my needs it has 2. the right one. The machine_ is easy to use and adds a new lease of life 3. the keyboard is a good size. The battery life is pretty good too. All 4. a joy to watch on it and the battery life is great. I would recommend it Examples (1) and (2) are characterised as expressed evaluation because the 4-gram is easy to use explicitly expresses evaluation, whereas examples (3) and (4) are associated evaluation because the 4-gram The battery life itself is not evaluative but evaluative lexis (e.g. good, great ) can be found it its wider lexical context.
Further analysis shows that 29 out of the total 83 4-grams, accounting for approximately 35 %, explicitly express evaluation (i.e. expressed evaluation ) and the rest of the 4-grams, accounting for approximately 65 %, is associated with evaluation (see Fig. 2 below).

As shown in Fig. 2 , instances of associated evaluation account for a much higher percentage than those of expressed evaluation . This may be easy to explain: (1) The review writers do not express their opinions too explicitly but prefer to implicitly convey their attitude because a review may appear to be fake if it is being too straightforward (in which case there is a possibility that the review readers may think that the review writer is cooperating with the manufacturers). (2) It is the multiword units, i.e. 4-grams, other than the evaluative lexis that are being discussed. Since it is time-consuming and very challenging (if at all possible) to read all the review texts in order to abstract the parameters with which we can explain how products are evaluated, it is more practical and feasible to identify these parameters starting with the analysis of the most frequent multiword-units in this corpus. However, unlike evaluative lexis, multiword-units are more likely to be associated with evaluative meanings because, while these frequent multiword-units themselves may not contain any attitudinal vocabulary, they have a strong tendency to co-occur with evaluative items. 4.2 Parameters for the evaluation of products As noted in Ro  X  mer ( 2008 : 128),  X  X  X a]part from the work that still needs to be done on identifying evaluation, a considerable amount of work lies ahead on classifying the identified expressions X  X . This work will be taken up in this section. Based on the concordance analysis, this study classifies the selected 4-grams in terms of the following four parameters: Quality, Satisfactoriness, Recommendability , and Worthiness ; these parameters are discussed and exemplified in greater detail below. 4.2.1 Quality It is not surprising that Quality is the most central parameter for the evaluation of products, since the quality of the products is of course the primary concern for consumers. Based on the corpus observation, Quality is further divided into three sub-values: Easiness, Balance and Remarkability ; they are respectively related to whether the product under evaluation is user-friendly, well-structured and functionally remarkable, as discussed below.
 Easiness is concerned with whether the product under evaluation is user-friendly. It is in a way similar to the Appreciation variable Composition: Complexity (i.e. is it hard to follow); however, it is arguable that the term Easiness is more self-explanatory and transparent in reflecting the discourse function of those n-grams which are associated with this meaning. Its typical realisations include, for example, easy to use and, easy to set up ; for instance,
The machine is easy to use and adds a new lease of life they love them. They were easy to set up and work great. They are
Much in line with Martin and White X  X  notion of Balance which means  X  X  X id it hang together X  X  (Martin and White 2005 : 56), the sub-value Balance in this study similarly refers to whether the product under evaluation is well-structured, e.g. is the product equipped with all necessary accessories, are the accessories located in a proper position; for instance, ports and they are located at the back of the panel. At the time of and  X  X earch X  buttons at the bottom of the phone are VERY good as The third sub-value Remarkability appears to be characteristic of customer review texts. No equivalent parameter or appraisal category that deals with this dimension of appreciating meaning can be found in existing frameworks of evaluation. In other words, the establishment of this parameter can be considered a good example which shows that the modelling and theorising of evaluation is largely dependent on the discourse type that is under examination.

At its simplest, Remarkability refers to whether the product under evaluation is functionally remarkable or has some features that are remarkable. Some examples associated with Remarkability are given below.

Nice monitor, works well out of the box without any adjustments to the ... i must tell you guys it is one of the best laptop I have ever worked.
 It is worth mentioning that the 4-grams realising Remarkability can also be associated with the attitudinal meaning that this product is recommendable, which will be elaborated in terms of the interplay of evaluative parameters later on (see also Bednarek 2006 : 58, 2008). 4.2.2 Satisfactoriness In the APPRAISAL model, linguistic resources used to construe feelings and emotional response are glossed as Affect (Martin 2000 ; Martin and White 2005 ). However, the present study does not separately analyse those n-grams associated with feelings and emotions in terms of Affect. The reasons are given below. Firstly, even though in Appraisal attitudinal meanings are divided into three sub-systems, i.e. Affect, Judgement and Appreciation, it has been noted that the distinctions between them are far from clear-cut (Martin and White 2005 ). For example, the Appreciation variable Reaction X  X  X  X o they catch our attentions; do they please us X  X  (Martin and White 2005 : 56) is closely related to the sub-types of Affect. This indicates the possibility of proposing a parameter to deal with emotional reactions as one dimension of appreciating meanings (e.g. Mental State is established as an independent parameter in Bednarek X  X  ( 2006 ) parameter-based framework of evaluation). Secondly, the separation of Affect from Appreciation: Reaction may add extra burden for an analyst to analyse evaluative expressions in a particular text type, because the more terms there are, the more complex the analysis would be, in particular for a computer-assisted discourse analysis. Thus one way to avoid this complexity may be to propose a unified framework of evaluation that can encompass and account for both affective and attitudinal resources employed in that specific context. Lastly, the modelling and theorising of evaluation needs to be based on much more evidence and analysis of larger amounts of data in various contexts; this may be the reason why currently there is no general framework of evaluation that is robust and powerful enough to account for evaluative resources employed in every context of situation (cf. Hommerberg and Don 2015 ). The point, then, is that it is important to propose a comprehensive and unified framework of evaluation that can be applied to account adequately for the evaluative language used in a particular text type. This is to some extent consistent with Bednarek X  X  ( 2009 : 186 X 187) argument that  X  X  X t might be sufficient to work with generalized categories ... , because this facilitates the analysis and limits the number of problematic categorizations X  X . Further, as the current investigation also aims to develop a framework which can be applied to assist the computational analysis of customer review texts, a more simplified system network of evaluation comprised of fewer categories is certainly desirable.
 The parameter Satisfactoriness , though largely overlapping with Affect in the Appraisal framework, is thus suggested to be an independent parameter for the proposed framework of products evaluation. To put it simply, Satisfactoriness refers to the customer X  X  emotional reaction towards the product or the purchase of the product. It is typically realised by n-grams such as am very happy with, am very pleased with, etc.; for instance, to gather in the corners! I am very happy with this product, be like second nature. I am very pleased with this purchase and One argument against my suggestion of having Satisfactoriness as an independent parameter for analysing appreciating resources found in customer review texts might be that we can ignore this aspect of evaluative meaning when discussing the evaluation of products. This of course would not be plausible, because this will lead to an over-simplification and consequently make the parameter-based framework incomprehensive. As will be shown in Fig. 3 below, a considerable number of 4-grams (24 out of 83) is associated with the construal of a reviewer X  X  emotional reaction towards the product s/he purchased. This means that this aspect of evaluative meaning is frequently expressed, and therefore it can by no means be ignored if we want to develop a theoretical framework that can be used to adequately describe how products are evaluated. 4.2.3 Recommendability It is arguable that one of the main discourse functions of customer review texts is to inform the review readers or potential buyers whether the product under evaluation is worth purchasing. Accordingly, it can be speculated that customer review texts should be rich in linguistic expressions that have this function. The corpus data does support this speculation. As will be shown in Fig. 3 below, 24 out of 83 4-grams either express or are associated with this type of appreciating meaning, i.e. opinions about whether or not the product under review is worth being recommended. Recommendability is therefore suggested to account for these expressions. It is typically realised by 4-grams such as recommend it to any one, i would highly recommend, etc.; for instance, battery life is great. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy difference between the two! I would highly recommend this laptop Like the variable Quality : Remarkability discussed above, Recommendability is also characteristic to this particular discourse type. It is thus not surprising that no corresponding parameter or appraisal category can be found in previously established theoretical frameworks of evaluation. This, in addition to supporting this paper X  X  argument that the modelling and theorising of evaluation is specific to the discourse type that is under examination, also indicates that the function of a discourse type is crucial for the task of theorising evaluation. 4.2.4 Worthiness Intuitively, it may be speculated that customers will be particularly concerned with whether or not a given product is reasonably priced. Quite surprisingly, however, the corpus data shows that there are, but only a very small number of (3 out of 87), 4-grams which are used to construe a customer X  X  concern of a product X  X  price (see Fig. 3 above). It is observed that, when customer reviewers talk about monetary aspects of the products they have purchased, they are not primarily concerned with whether the price is much higher (or lower) than they have expected, but are more concerned with whether they can get what they have paid for. In this sense, this aspect of appreciating meaning, as identified in customer review texts, is slightly different from the Appreciation variable Valuation:  X  X  X as it worthwhile X  X  (Martin and White 2005 : 56). To make the distinction clearer, the parameter Worthiness , instead of borrowing the term Valuation , is thus proposed to account for both whether the product under evaluation is worthy of the money a customer has paid for and whether it is reasonably priced. The typical realisations for this parameter include 4-grams such as good value for money, what you pay for ; for example, size class, this laptop is good value for money and certainly won X  X  You certainly get what you pay for and Macs go on forever Summing up, four parameters, i.e. Quality (Q), Satisfactoriness (S), Recommend-ability (R) and Worthiness (W), are identified based on the n-gram analysis. Since these parameters are not thought-up, but are generalised from the analysis of language used in real contexts and informed by existing theoretical frameworks of evaluation (i.e. Appraisal), it is arguable that the proposed parameter-based framework of evaluation is certainly valid and therefore can be used to account reliably and adequately for the evaluation of products. Based on the analysis above, the parameters are summarised and succinctly explained in Table 2 (see below), and an overview of the distribution of 4-grams into the four parameters is shown in Fig. 3 .

Some observations can be drawn from the above analysis. To start with, the proposed parameter-based framework of products evaluation is clearly rather different from that of Appreciation suggested in the Appraisal framework or that of Bednarek X  X  ( 2006 ) parameters identified in a corpus of news discourse. As noted in Sect. 4 , no equivalent appraisal categories or parameters can be found for Quality : Remarkability and Recommendability in previous studies, because no study to date has specifically focused on the investigation of evaluative language in this particular text type, i.e. customer review texts. In addition, it should be noted that though the terminology used to refer to an evaluative variable may be the same, the connotation of the variable is not necessarily similar but is dependent on the context. For example, Balance in the current investigation relates to the well-structuredness of the products that customers have purchased, whereas Balance in discourse of examiners X  report on doctoral theses  X  X  X s concerned with the presentation of the thesis in terms of coherency, cohesiveness, logic, length, flow and formatting X  X  (Starfield et al. 2015 : 136). This indicates that taxonomies of evaluative meanings are highly context-dependent (see also Millar and Hunston 2015 ) and consequently, the modelling and theorising of evaluation is specific to a particular context.
Secondly, the fact that the parameter Satisfactoriness occupies a very high proportion indicates a close connection between emotion and evaluation (see also Downes 2000 ; Martin and White 2005 ). That is, the construal of a review writer X  X  emotional reaction can invoke the reader X  X  evaluation of the products and most likely also encourage the reader to accept and share the same evaluation with the review writer. Further, the observation that a product can be evaluated not only by its quality, but also by the construal of customers X  emotional response towards it suggests that the strategic uses of affective resources by review writers may be a prominent stylistic feature of customer review texts.

Thirdly, it has been mentioned earlier that there is an  X  X nterplay X  between these evaluative parameters (see also Bednarek 2006 , 2008 ). This is particularly true for those 4-grams which express Satisfactoriness but co-occur with those construing Recommendability . Some examples from the corpus are given below to show this interaction. Multi-word units marked in bold face are associated with Satisfactori-ness and those underlined with Recommendability . 5. Apart from this I am very happy with the product and would happily 6. I am very happy with this, and would highly recommend it. 7. I am very happy with what I got and I would recommend the camera to 8. Overall I am very happy with this product. I would recommend it These examples show that the multiword units express a given parameter by themselves, but at the same time, the multiword expressions may co-occur with other multiword expressions which are associated with another parameter. More specifically, it is clear that these examples, on the one hand, indicate the reviewer X  X  emotional reaction towards the products, and on the other hand, are followed by instances expressing Recommendability . This shows that there is an interplay between evaluative parameters, which may be difficult for other approaches to capture. The point is that a parameter-based approach to evaluation contributes to our understanding of how evaluation is realised in discourse. For example, in the present study, it contributes to our understanding of how evaluative meanings are expressed in customer review texts; that is, evaluation of products can not only be realised by talking about the quality of, or by expressing emotional reactions towards, the purchased product, but also by combining different aspects of appreciating meanings.

The interplay between evaluative parameters makes it necessary to interpret the correlation between them. It is arguable that Quality , among the four parameters, is the most crucial factor for evaluating products, which can be supported by the observation that 4-grams associated with Quality occupy the highest proportion. The other three dimensions are dependent on Quality . To put it simply, the interrelation between the four parameters identified in this study can be stated as follows: if a product is of good quality and reasonably priced, the review writer will most likely to be satisfied with the purchased product and will be willing to recommend it to his/ her acquaintances. This interplay can be shown in Fig. 4 below.

The correlation between these parameters brings in the final observation. That is, a general pattern of customer review texts can be abstracted from the current investigation. That is, a review writer mainly focuses on the following aspects: the quality and the function of the product, whether s/he is satisfied with the product s/ he has purchased, whether the product s/he purchased meet his/her needs, and finally, based on the evaluation of the aforementioned factors, the review writer will decide whether or not s/he is going to recommend the product to review readers or other potential buyers. Further, the fact that a general pattern can be observed also suggests that a community may be constructed by expressing the participants X  shared values (cf. Knight 2008 ; Millar and Hunston 2015 ). In the present study, for example, customer reviewers form a community through their participation of writing review texts in which their shared values are expressed.
 The current investigation has both theoretical and methodological implications. Theoretically, it shows clearly that evaluation is highly context-specific, which strongly supports this paper X  X  argument that the modelling and theorising of evaluation is specific to the discourse type that is under examination. Methodolog-ically, this study shows that evaluation research benefits greatly from corpus linguistic investigation. That is, corpus investigation can not only provide the evidence that can be used to test or refine existing theoretical frameworks of evaluation, but also the evidence to propose a new framework of evaluation (that is specific to a particular text type). This has been largely exemplified in the present study which, based on the corpus investigation of evaluative language used in customer review texts, proposed a data-driven, parameter-based and appraisal-informed framework of evaluation for analysing this particular discourse type.
While acknowledging that there are limitations of the proposed framework of evaluation, it is arguable that this framework can at least be applied to assist computational analysis of customer review texts, for example, sentiment analysis. As noted earlier, sentiment analysis is primarily concerned with automatic identification and classification of evaluative expressions in naturally occurring texts, which indicates that an effective analytic scheme is required. The parameters identified in this study can be used as such an analytic framework for computational annotation and analysis of evaluative expressions associated with the evaluation of products. This facilitates market investigation, which has further practical appli-cations. That is, the findings of the analysis can provide the manufacturers with feedback about what the customers think about their products and services. The manufacturers can, accordingly, improve their products and services, which in turn helps to build their brand reputation and ultimately increase their profits. See Table 3 .
