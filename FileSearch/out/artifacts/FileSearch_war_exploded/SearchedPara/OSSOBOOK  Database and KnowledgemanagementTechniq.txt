 This demo describes the OSSOBOOK database system de-veloped for archaeozoology applications providing data stor-age, data retrieval, and data mining facilities. It shows a case study of integrating state-of-the-art database concepts like intermittently synchronized database system as well as con-cepts of information retrieval and knowledge representation like similarity search and data mining in order to provide a comprehensive system for an interesting application do-main.

Archaeozoology deals with the analysis of animal remains that have been uncovered by archaeological excavations to proof scientific assumptions and derive new hypothesis. For that purpose, researchers maintain archaeological excava-tions all over the world, producing a tremendous amount of information that can no longer be analyzed by any hu-man manually. Rather, the information on individual find-ings, e.g. descriptions of osseous parts, should be stored in a database system and should be available for analysis pur-poses like information retrieval and data mining via a cen-tral portal. Since the findings can usually not be transferred to other locations due to regional legal restrictions or high transportation costs, the information on these findings need to be recorded on-site. In order to avoid a redundant and error-prone data recording including a manual and ad hoc on-site documentation at the location of each excavation fol-lowed by a successive input of this documentation into a cen-tral database at some institute, an advanced and integrated database system is envisioned. Furthermore, it should be capable of dealing with the application specific obstacles, in particular with the fact that internet access may not be available during long field sessions all the time. Thus, the system must provide dedicated synchronization concepts in order to allow online access to the central database even if internet access cannot be guaranteed persistently at the lo-cation of a given excavation. Last but not least, the system should also be capable to share data from different insti-tutions all over the world that work in different projects. Therefore, the system should enable an advanced project management.

In this demonstration we present OSSOBOOK, a sys-tem that provides a solution for such archaeozoology ap-plications. In particular, OSSOBOOK implements a mobile database system using the concept of intermittently syn-chronized databases [2] to handle the application specific problem that users may have no persistent access to the cen-tral system due to network constraints but may still want to update certain parts of the database. A client-server architecture ensures that each client (usually a particular researcher equipped with a laptop) manages its own local database that is schema-equivalent to the central database at the server. This way, each client can make its updates locally, independently, and X  X ost important X  X ffline. At a given time, e.g. when a network connection to the server is established, the client and the server synchronize, i.e. the updates of the client are inserted into the central database at the server and the updates of the server (e.g. originating from other clients that have already synchronized) are send to the client. The application scenario of the OSSOBOOK system is visualized in Figure 1. The central database is located at some institute. Within the institute, clients can connect to this central database system. On the field, each client has its own local copy of the central database and can Figure 1: The architecture of the mobile OSSO-BOOK database system. connect from time to time to the central repository via a network for synchronization. The OSSOBOOK database is implemented as a MySQL DB with a JAVA GUI. For the purpose of collaboration be-tween different institutes in different countries all over the world, the central database has a user management which allows the institutes to manage there own projects inde-pendently from each other. Research results stay related to the institute. Each cooperating institute can maintain its own database which will synchronize with the central database. Within an institute, clients connect either directly to a project on the local institute database or they log in to the related project on the central database. In case of field work, the researcher has a copy of the project on a local in-stalled OSSOBOOK database on his notebook. He therefore can use and alter all the project related data directly on the field. As soon as the researcher has internet access, he can synchronize his local database with the institute database which then will synchronize with the central database.
On the central database all the research data is stored in the different projects of the different institutes. Here, the data mining algorithms are provided to all participants. These data mining concepts use the complete dataset of all collaborating institutes. This is the main scientific advan-tage of the OSSOBOOK database. Similarities in data col-lected in different parts of the world, on different time peri-ods, by different institutes can be shown independently from the internal use of the data.

OSSOBOOK is an intermittently synchronized database system which operates in double depth. First stage is the synchronization of the local databases of the field clients to the local institutes database. The second stage is the syn-chronization of the institute database to the central database. Within these stages data input can be done at the field clients and at the local institute clients. The data min-ing concepts can be used from the local institute clients at the central database without direct access to the underlying central data.

On all stages the requirements of an Intermittently Syn-chronized Database System (replication, synchronization, er-ror tolerance) are met.
OSSOBOOK not only provides a standard relational database system for storing data of archaeological findings. It also provides facilities for retrieving and mining this data.
Beside the standard retrieval capabilities of relational database systems, OSSOBOOK provides the possibility to perform similarity queries on more complex objects like 2D pictures, 3D models of bones or skeletons, and time series of findings.
The data mining unit of OSSOBOOK provides with al-gorithms for standard data mining tasks such as cluster-ing, outlier detection, classification and association rule min-ing to do specialized, domain-driven analysis of the entire database. For example, association rule mining based on the Apriori algorithm [1] is used for rating archaeological excavations. Every excavation can be treated as a market basket, the items are the found objects. From the applica-tion, it is now interesting to find rules like  X  X f item A been found, item B will also be found with a probability of x % X . This gives the local excavation manager a list of items to look for. The Institute for Palaeoanatomy of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit  X  at M  X  unchen (LMU), Germany, participates at an archaeological excavation in G  X  obekli Tepe, Turkey. About 30,000 bones of different animals are analyzed. Originally, these data have been recorded manually. Now the OSSO-BOOK system is used for data input and data storage. In this demo, we will exemplarily show how archaeological data from the G  X  obekli excavation is input into a local client and then synchronized with the central database at LMU. The data consists of classical relational data as well as complex data like pictures and 3D spatial objects. We will also show how the data mining capabilities of OSSOBOOK can give a rating of the current findings in the site, taking other projects all over the world into account. In particular, OS-SOBOOK can derive a list of items, each associated with a probability that it can still be found in G  X  obekli Tepe.
The complete source code of the current OSSOBOOK system is accessible via SOURCEFORGE.NET at http: //sourceforge.net/projects/ossobook .
In this demonstration we present the OSSOBOOK sys-tem for archaeozoology applications that integrates core DB, KM, and IR concepts and provides first-hand experiences with research prototype systems from these areas. We show how the synchronization of multiple users in a client-server environment can be performed by using the concept of in-termittently synchronized database systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate how specialized data mining techniques can provide important application specific services like the rat-ing of archaeological excavations, etc. Last but not least, this demo outlines a completely new application area that provides a variety of novel problems for researchers in the areas of DB, KM, and IR.
