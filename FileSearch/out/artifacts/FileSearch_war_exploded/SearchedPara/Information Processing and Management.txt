 Project Management in Practice, Third Ed., Samuel J. Mantel, Jr., Jack R. Meredith, Scott M. Shafer, Margaret M. Sutton. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., (2008). ISBN: 978-0-470-12164-1
The use of projects as a way to accomplish work has increased drastically in the last 15 years. This increase in project work has brought with it an increased need for skilled and educated managers to oversee and execute these projects. Many existing and potential project managers are turning to  X  X  X hort courses X  in project management to educate themselves quickly in this growing field. Instructors of these short courses have requested a textbook that focuses on the  X  X  X echnical X  aspects of project management, foregoing the history and theoretically background of project management. With the release of Project Management in Practice, Third Edition , the authors have attempted to meet these instructors X  demands.

This book is intended to be a practice, rather than research-oriented textbook in the continually growing field of project management. It provides practical, applied knowledge of project work organized around the project life cycle, including a chapter for each major stage in the life cycle. Additionally, at the end of each chapter, the authors have included review ques-tions, discussion questions, problems and incidents for discussion which focus on the implications and applications of the ideas and techniques covered in the text, and offer students an opportunity to develop their skills in the technical areas of project management. The book is intended for students with elementary training in management or equivalent experience. While this book is not intended to be a research-oriented textbook, it does, in chapters one and two,  X  X  X he World of Project Management X  and  X  X  X he Manager, the Organization, and the Team X , lay out the basic principles of project management. These basics include the definition of a project, the three main goals of a project, the project life cycle, the project portfolio process, the importance of managing risk, the roles and responsibilities of the project manager and the project team, as well as how projects fit within the larger organization.

After these introductory points are made, the more practical or applied topics are covered in chapters three through eight, including subjects such as project planning, budgeting, scheduling, resource allocation, monitoring and controlling and eval-uation. The authors not only provide a clear and concise explanation of the major activities involved in project management, they have also included example templates and example Microsoft Excel spreadsheets throughout the book. The book also in-cludes free trials of two popular and widely used software packages  X  a free 120-day trail edition of Microsoft Project 2007  X  as well as a free trial edition of Decisioneering X  X  Crystal Ball  X  7.3, allowing students an opportunity to practice what they have learned.
 Throughout the book, the authors refer to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) published by the Project Management Institute (PMI). This book lays out the standards and practices for project managers and is accepted globally as the  X  X  X ible X  of project management. The PMBOK offers insight into the definition of a project, project planning, project chart-ing, project budgeting, risk management and project reporting among many other topics. In today X  X  world of project man-agement, project managers are expected to know the guidelines set out by the PMBOK and act accordingly; therefore, this textbook helps inexperienced project managers learn the basics, while also learning the global standard.

Overall, Project Management in Practice, Third Edition , presents a coherent and structured presentation of applied project management practices. One of the advantages of this book is that is provides readers with useful examples while also offer-ing references to more research-oriented literature that serve well and lead readers to further detailed and background information. Further, this book includes comprehensive cases for particular projects that act as a superb tool for readers to think about what they have learned and integrate the topics from stage to stage in the life cycle. While the readers do not need to possess any specialist knowledge in the area of project management, they will receive a comprehensive over-view of project management activities, and the technical, interpersonal, and organizational glitches that impact the true day-to-day life of every project manager.


Computational Methods of Feature Selection,Huan Liu, Hiroshi Motoda, CRC Press, Boca Raton,FL (2007). 440 pp., Price: $93.95, ISBN: 978-1-58488-878-9
Computational Methods of Feature Selection is a quite successful effort to put together a number of recent developments from various disciplines. It does not only present state of the art methodologies but also understandable illustrations along with real world case studies.

The book has been edited by two well known researchers and experienced editors, Liu and Motoda who have made a similar contributions to the research community about 10 years ago. In terms of presentation it has around 400 pages, it is a light book and with a good general layout.

The book has 20 chapters divided into five parts, and includes chapters with readable introductions which are surely quite useful to those just starting in the field or those from other research areas who are facing a feature selection problem.
In the Part I of the book: Introduction and background , the reader can find four chapters, as in all other parts. The first one is called: Less is More .

In this chapter the editors present an introduction to the field and discuss the need for good data selection techniques to keep pace with the rather high rate of data collection and the benefits of feature selection.

The reader can find an explanation about the five parts the book is divided, namely Introduction and Background, Extend-ing Feature Selection, Weighting and Local Methods, Text Feature Selection, and Feature Selection in Bioinformatics.
The main argument presented in this chapter is that feature selection can efficiently reduce the hypothesis space by removing irrelevant and redundant features. The smaller the hypothesis space, the easier it is to find correct hypothesis. Here the reader can also find an introduction related to how the selection of features can be achieved.
The authors finalize the chapter presenting an overview of the research activities included in the book, chapter by chapter which indicates to the different types of readers from where they should start reading.

In its second chapter, Unsupervised Feature Selection the reader is introduced to what unsupervised learning is using a clustering example together with why there is a need for such learning method.

After explain that not all features are important as some may be redundant or irrelevant, and that the existence of several irrelevant features can misguide clustering results the author provides a review of the basic components of feature selection algorithms.

In this review the reader can find clear explanations of algorithms such as branch and bound, with the appropriate emphasis of this being impractical for feature selection problems with more than 30 features. Sequential Forward Selection, Sequential Backward Elimination and their floating versions.

The author then discusses feature evaluation arguing that it is actually deciding the evaluation criteria that makes feature selection in clustering difficult.

The reader is also presented to two approaches for feature selection, Wrap and Filter together with a number of methods for unsupervised feature selection, including global and local approaches.

In Chapter 3, Randomized Feature Selection , the author makes an interesting argument that randomized algorithms are either the simplest or the fastest algorithms available, and sometimes both. The author explains that randomization is useful when there are many ways available in which to proceed but determining a guaranteed good way is difficult, and argues that it can also lead to efficient algorithms when the benefits of good choices outweigh the cost of bad choices, or when good choices occur more frequently than bad choices.
 In this chapter the reader can find discussions of two types of randomizations that may be applied to a given problem: Las Vegas and Monte Carlo and is presented with examples of randomized selection algorithms based on them.
The author also discusses the known issues with this type of algorithms, for instance the probabilistic behaviour that gives randomized algorithms their power also makes them difficult to analyze.

Another presented issue the reader should have in mind is that randomized algorithms necessarily depend on the ability to produce a sequence of random numbers. No matter how sophisticated a pseudorandom number generating algorithm may be, it will eventually revisit a past stage and begin repeating the number sequence.

In Chapter 4, Casual Feature Selection the reader can find an argument in favour of understanding and utilizing the notion of causality for feature selection.

The authors explain their point of view in which determining and exploiting casual relationships is central in human rea-soning and decision making. The goal of determining casual relationships is to predict the consequences of given actions or manipulations. The authors argue that causes are better targets of action of external agents than effects.
The reader can find a section providing formal definitions of irrelevance and relevance from the point of view of classical (non casual) feature selection.

The chapter presents very interesting remarks, for instance unknown features, including possible artefacts or confound-ers, may cause the whole scaffold of casual feature discovery to fall apart if their possible existence is ignored. The reader can also find related algorithms and a discussion about the open questions in the field.
Chapter 5, Active Learning of Feature Relevance deals with active feature value acquisition for feature relevance estimation in domains where feature values are expensive to measure. The reader is presented with a general active feature sampling method for feature relevance estimation for such scenarios.

In this method at any stage, the feature sampling method evaluates the benefit of sampling the value of every individual missing entry in the dataset and selects the one with the highest benefit.

The authors point out that the algorithm can be applied with other models and measures for feature relevance which surely open doors for integration with other algorithms.

Chapter 6, A study of Feature Extraction Techniques Based on Decision Border Estimate presents the reader a study on feature extraction techniques for classification based on the decision boundary feature extraction (DBFE) principle.
The chapter details the techniques that apply DBFE principle on approximations of the Bayes decision border extracted by neural network classifiers. It focuses in multi-layer perceptron and support vector machines.

The reader is presented with an introduction to a formal derivation of the DBFE principle for Labelled Vector Quantizers (LVQ). The chapter shows that LVQ allows for a cheap representation of decision borders, and that most discriminative fea-tures can be easily extracted from it.
 The authors also present results showing the derived method Bayes Risk Weighted Vector Quantization Algorithm for
Feature Extraction (BVQFE) having a lower computational cost than others. The authors furthers their discussion arguing that BVQFE is the only DBFE based method that can directly manage real problems where the misclassification costs differ from one class to another.

Chapter 7, Esemble-Based Variable Selection Using Independent Probes presents an efficient approach to feature selection using independent probe variables. The authors X  result is a truly autonomous variable selection method that considers all variables interactions and does not require a pre-set number of important values.

The method provides excellent results in a variety of simulated and real-life complex datasets. The authors demonstrate it performs favourably when tested against several different and reportedly powerful feature selection methods.
Interestingly the method does not require any preprocessing, it is applicable to both classification and regression prob-lems and it reports redundant features if at least one of them is relevant to a response.

The authors also argue that if the best-subset problem is of interest, a penalization strategy can be easily added to the ensemble construction, which prevents redundant variables from entering the model.

In Chapter 8, Efficient Incremental-Ranked Feature Selection in Massive Data the authors argue that the most popular search methods in machine learning cannot be applied to massive databases, especially when a wrapper approach is used as an evaluation function.

In order to deal with the above problem the authors derive a new method called The Best Incremental Ranked Subset (BIRS). The method uses the incremental ranked usefulness definition to decide at the same time whether or not a feature is relevant and non redundant. By consequence the technique extracts the best non-consecutive features from the ranking.
The authors argue that his approach reduces the search space complexity as it works directly on the ranking, transform-ing the combinatorial search of a sequential forward search into a quadratic search. However, as the authors continue, the evaluation is much less expensive as only a few features are selected, and therefore the subset evaluation is computationally inexpensive in comparison to other approaches involving wrapper methodologies.

Taking all the above into consideration the authors conclude that for massive databases, wrapper-based methods might be computationally unfeasible, so BIRS turns out to be a fast technique that provides performance in predicting accuracy.
In Chapter 9, Non-Myopic Feature Quality Evaluation with (R)ReliefF the authors argue that the majority of the other meth-ods are myopic in a sense that they estimate the quality of one feature independently of the context of other features.
In this chapter the reader is presented with an overview of myopic impurity based measures for feature evaluation and a definition of the basic algorithm Relief for non-myopic feature evaluation. The authors also show the relation between myo-pic impurity measures and Relief.

The authors follow to expand Relief into a more realistic variant called ReliefF. This variant is able to deal with incomplete data, multi-class problems, and is robust with respect to noise. The authors further their idea extending it to regressional problems and implement the Regression ReliefF (RReliefF).

The authors demonstrate that although others claim that (R)ReliefF is computationally demanding, this is not an inherent property and that efficient implementations exist.

In Chapter 10, Weighting Method for Feature Selection in K-Means the authors explain that when using K -Means or one of its many variants in real applications there is always the unavoidable task of determine the set of features. The authors fur-ther their discussion by explaining that a common practice is to select features based on business domain knowledge and data exploration.

The argument presented in the chapter is that this manual approach is difficult to use, time consuming and frequently cannot make the right selection and that by consequence an automated method is needed to solve the feature selection problems in K -Means.

The authors then demonstrate their solution which is an automated feature selection by feature weighting within the clustering process and claim it is efficient in clustering of large data. The chapter includes satisfactory experimental results on text data.

The authors acknowledge that some further research problems remain, for instance how to specify the parameters for the algorithm and the number of clusters.

In Chapter 11, Local Feature Selection for Classification the reader can find a number of techniques to address data explo-ration tasks such as classification together with a helpful comparison between them. All methods design adaptive metrics or parameters estimates that are local in input space in order to dodge the curse of dimensionality phenomenon. The authors argue that such techniques have been demonstrated to be effective for the achievement of accurate predictions.
In Chapter 12, Feature Weighting Through Local Learning the author argues that most feature selection algorithms rely on heuristic searching and thus cannot provide any guarantee of optimality.

The author follows then to provide a mathematical interpretation of the seemingly heuristic Relief algorithm as an online method solving a convex optimization problem with a margin-based objective function. Based on this the author proposes a set of new feature weighting algorithms.

The author X  X  main idea is to learn non-linear discriminant information of features locally and solve a set of convex opti-mization problems globally. The core module of these algorithms is just the finding of the nearest neighbours of each pattern.

The author then shows that the performance of his algorithm is not sensitive to the choice of the free parameter, and argues that this makes model selection easy in practical applications.

The chapter also presents a large scale experiment which demonstrates that the author X  X  algorithms perform significantly better than Relief and Simba.

Chapter 13, Feature Selection for Text Classification starts by introducing the many applications for text classification such as spam detection, automatic sorting of documents, etc.

The chapter also describes a variety of common feature generators, which may be used to produce many potentially use-ful features, and the details of feature selection for binary and multi-class settings. The introduction also describes the three major paradigms of feature selection, and the common characteristics of the text domain.

The author illustrates the gains that the described methods can provide, both in selecting a subset of words and in select-ing a good combination of feature generators.

In Chapter 14, A Bayesian Feature Selection Score Based on Na X ve Bayes Models the authors introduce a flexible feature selection score, PIP (Posterior Inclusion Probability). Unlike other popular feature selection scores following the filtering approach, PIP is a model-dependent score, where the model can take several different forms.

The authors argue that the advantage of this score is that the selected features are easy to interpret, the computation of this score is inexpensive, and when the predicting model corresponds to a na X ve Bayes model the score depends also on the predicting model, which can lead to better classification performance.

The authors follow then to describe the applicability of the method as for example a regular filtering score as part of the prepocessing of the data for dimensionality reduction before fitting the predicting model.

In Chapter 15, Pairwise Constraints-Guided Dimensionality Reduction the reader is introduced to two pairwise constraints-guided dimensionality reduction techniques, and an investigation of how they can be used to improve semi-supervised clus-tering performance, especially for very high-dimensional data.

The authors argue that the proposed pairwise constraints-guided dimensionality reduction techniques seem to be a promising new way of leveraging  X  X  X eak X  supervision to improve the quality of clustering, and illustrate their argument by the experimental results on the selected text datasets.

Chapter 16, Aggressive Feature Selection by Feature Ranking starts by discussing aggressive feature selection with higher than 95% feature reduction.

The authors propose a method which deals with redundancies and improves aggressive feature selection by information gain ranking for text classifiers.

They argue that since the length of the feature vector in this strategy is quite short, the text classifiers, working with very small feature vectors, are very sensitive to noise, outliers, and redundancies. The authors then conclude that because of these restrictions, improving any classical feature selection method such as feature ranking for aggressive reduction is strongly necessary.

The chapter presents experimental results showing that the effect of term can be worse than noise and that the proposed approach outperformed the aggressive feature selection by the stand-alone information gain.

Chapter 17, Feature Selection for Genomic Data Analysis introduces the concept of an optimal gene set based on a Markov blanket, and proposes an efficient filter method to approximate the selection of discriminative and non-redundant genes.
The proposed algorithm removes both irrelevant and redundant genes in the filtering process and thus does not require a threshold for the number of selected genes.

The author argues that his algorithm allows it to be used to search for biologically relevant genes by incorporating prior biological knowledge into the gene selection process.
In Chapter 18, A Feature Generation Algorithm with Applications to Biological Sequence Classification the authors present a general feature generation framework that integrates feature construction and feature selection in a flexible manner. The authors also show how this method can be used to build accurate sequence classifiers which have achieved improvements of up to 10.6%.

The authors explain that using the feature generation approach, they were able to identify the most useful set of features of each type, which have also shown a propensity to describe biologically significant functional elements.
The authors argue that the presented algorithm could be applied to more complex feature types and other sequence pre-diction tasks, such as translation starsite prediction, protein sequence classification problems, etc.
Chapter 19, An Ensemble Method for Identifying Robust Features for Biomarker Discovery starts by explaining what a bio-marker is and its usefulness for diagnostic or prognostic test.

In this chapter the authors present an ensemble framework for feature selection for building classifiers with wide data. In this framework features that are selected often, that result in accurate classifiers, and that are part of small feature sets are considered more robust and are favoured by the weighted voting function.

Using widely studied ovarian cancer datasets; the authors demonstrate that the features selected by their method give very high classification rates and reproducible results with new data.

In Chapter 20, Model Building and Feature Selection with Genomic Data the authors present the elastic net as being a novel shrinkage and selection method for producing a sparse model with good prediction accuracy.

The authors argue it enjoys great computational efficiency with the help of efficient path algorithms and that the algo-rithm is in many ways a more appropriate tool for variable selection with high-dimensional data than lasso. The chapter presents working applications of the method in regression and classification problems.
Overall the book presents state-of-the-art research by leading experts in a variety of fields within feature selection, in a readable way which would surely be of much use to most researchers.

Conquest in Cyberspace, M.C. Libicki. Cambridge University Press, New York (2007). 336 pp., $27.99, ISBN-13: 9780521692144  X  X  X onquest in Cyberspace X  is an attempt to examine the strategic implications of cyberspace. The author, Dr. Martin C.
Libicki, focuses on a  X  X  X ard power versus soft power X  argument as he tackles the very broad and technically complex area of net-centric operations. Throughout the book, the author contends that  X  X  X ard power X  or hostile actions in cyberspace are less effective and less permanent than soft power or persuasive actions.

This theme is the focal point of the book. Starting with a chapter on hostile action in cyberspace, Dr. Libicki discusses the effect of deception or noise in net-centric operations. Subsequent chapters examine the opportunities and challenges to col-laborate and form coalitions in cyberspace. The bulk of the book X  X  material is contained in the chapters that explore the costs and benefits of friendly conquests in cyberspace.

The introduction to  X  X  X onquest in Cyberspace X  indicates that Dr. Libicki sought to provide an exploration of  X  X  X he potential and limitations of information warfare. X  Having read that, I expected the book to discuss the strategic implications of cyber environment and especially to highlight the differences between the warfare in a virtual world vice a real world. In the end, however, the author comes short of both goals for several reasons.

The first, and I believe most important, shortcoming of this book is that it never discusses the possible strategic objectives of an information warfare campaign in cyberspace. There is no identification of who is contending for cyberspace and what their objectives might be. The author deals with the topic in a very abstract manner and never discusses the influences of organized crime, non-state terrorists, and state-sponsored intelligence agencies as adversaries or allies in cyberspace.
The overwhelming use of dated references is the second shortcoming with this book. With the exception of the appendix, most references pre-date 2002 and, therefore, do not discuss more recent developments. Cyber conflicts staged during the
Kosovo air war, information campaigns by Islamic jihadists, or any of the recent examples of politically-motivated cyber con-flict such as the denial of service attacks against Estonia are notably absent.

 Organizing Knowledge: An Introduction to Managing Access to Information, fourth ed., Jennifer Rowley, Richard Hartley (Eds.). Ashgate Publishing Co., Farnham (2008). 392 pp., Price $39.95, ISBN: 978-0-7546-4431-6
This is the fourth edition of a widely used text in the field of knowledge organization, first published in 1987. A number of other reviews have already been written of this work, ranging from strong endorsements (Tran, 2008 ) to criticisms of the foundations underlying some of the traditional approaches to knowledge organization (particularly in subject access) (Hj X rland, 2009 ) or the coverage of specific areas of growing importance (such as non-text content) (Terris, 2008 ). This range of opinions points out that we are still waiting for the perfect textbook in the area of knowledge organization, and highlights some of the difficulties inherent in writing a textbook in a rapidly changing field with an ever-growing audience that does not intend to make their home in the traditional library.

The current edition of the book is organized into three sections, each treating a different aspect of knowledge organiza-tion X  X tructuring and Describing, Access, and Systems. This configuration has evolved through the editions of the book over the years as the environment has changed, and reflects the authors X  perceptions of the best way to organize the major com-ponents of the discipline for ease of comprehension. In the first section (Structuring and Describing), the authors provide the foundations for understanding the purpose of organizing knowledge and information (Chapter 1); a basic introduction to the different ways that have been used in the past to structure information for use within information systems (Chapter 2); and finally, in Chapter 3, a brief overview of traditional ways of describing documents, with particular emphasis on bibliographic description.

The second section (Access) is the longest and most detailed of the three parts, and covers the basic material necessary for practitioners hoping to provide successful access to knowledge in a traditional library setting, starting with an important chapter on the examination of the users of the information and their behavior (Chapter 4). Subsequent chapters (5 X 8) delve into determining subject access points, establishing classification schemes and ordering content, other approaches such as subject heading lists, taxonomies and ontologies, and title and author access points. Each of these areas is amply illustrated with examples from historic and current practice, using illustrations drawn primarily from traditional library practice.
The last section (Systems) examines various types of systems that enable knowledge access in the digital environment (Chapter 9); the design and principles of information retrieval systems (Chapter 10); non-digital organizing systems (Chap-ter 11); and finally, an important chapter on the management of knowledge systems (Chapter 12). This last chapter contains new material on project management and change management, two areas of expertise that are critical for any practitioner in the field, and each worthy of a book in themselves.

The coverage of the material is thorough as far as it goes, and provides a sound survey of practice and theory in the tra-ditional discipline of knowledge organization from a library perspective. However, Hj X rland X  X  (2009) statement that  X  X  ... KO is fundamentally about concepts and their semantic relations, about semantic tools and knowledge organizing processes, that different views of knowledge, language, concepts and disciplines have implications for theories of KO ...  X  points out an important shortcoming of this book and others like it that are meant as survey texts for students of library and information science. There are other contexts and disciplines that engage in research and practice in knowledge organization (and may even call it by the same name), and more and more, our students need to know about these other perspectives to be effective theoreticians and practitioners. The authors themselves point this out as their own goal in their introduction:  X  X  X his book seeks to identify and explain the principles that underlie the structuring of knowledge in a wide variety of different contexts. It seeks to strike a balance between the identification of principles, and the description of their application in specific contexts. X 
It is evident that this book is of value to the community it serves (given that this is the fourth edition and it was first published in 1987), but I find a gap between the authors X  approach and what is needed in a text that would address the di-verse requirements of many beginning students in our current environment (and meet the authors X  broader goal). While the authors have limited the scope of coverage to the traditional domain of knowledge organization (bibliographic description and access), many students interested in this topic will never work in traditional library settings (even among those who are in graduate programs of library and information science). For this growing population, we need to find a way to bring the important lessons from traditional knowledge organization out of the world of bibliographic materials and into the larger domain of content in general, and fold in other perspectives on what constitutes theory and practice in this area. We are in the midst of major changes in our production and use of content X  X ormal and informal, text and non-text, managed and un-managed, publisher-generated and user-generated X  X nd while bibliographic practice will not go away, it is becoming nec-essary to translate that knowledge into the diverse situations where many more people are struggling with the organization of information objects that are not documents, not text, and not surrogates. The authors have made a valiant attempt to in-clude this perspective in their book over time, but the bibliographic roots are still too strong for the taste of most would-be information managers who will never deal with that world.
 ence, and does an excellent job of covering that territory for those readers. It is more a suggestion that this basic knowledge needs to be communicated in a different way (perhaps in a different text), with less reliance on the artifacts of library science and more examples from current practice and theory outside of libraries. The principles articulated in the book are signif-icant underpinnings for anyone who will do work in knowledge organization in a library setting, but there is a need for this material to be presented and described in ways that mean something to a student who will not practice in a library. Making this knowledge accessible to those who may be organizing information for a department in a large institution, or designing a medical ontology for a health system, or working on an e-commerce site to build a catalog of items for sale is fast becoming a critical need. There is an opportunity here for a new approach to this domain, without losing the foundational practice and theory that is well-presented in this text.
 better overall choice for those working with students that plan careers in more diverse environments, because it does go farther toward making the principles and practice of knowledge organization less bound to the library tradition, while still not entirely losing that connection. For those working in libraries as they transition to managing more than books, however, the text under review still continues to provide a strong foundation, and a jumping off point for those who might be explor-ing knowledge organization in other settings if combined with current literature from areas outside the field of library science.

Through an inductive approach, intended to balance theory and practice, Wankel and Kingsley provide an investigation of the recent historical growth and interest in the virtual world of Second Life within the academic community. As millions of users ( residents ) arrive in virtual worlds, especially the digital natives, educators are exploring the potential for learning through hundreds of projects, such as those illustrated in Higher Education in Virtual Worlds: Teaching and Learning in Second Life .

Thirty-four contributing authors were chosen to provide a variety of focal points and perspectives on both the benefits and the drawbacks of using virtual worlds in higher education. As a starting point, the technical barriers to entry include the need for powerful graphics cards, appropriate bandwidth for VoIP, and access across firewalls. Recommendations for over-coming the barriers are part of the treasure of this book. Funding barriers can be overcome by framing use of virtual worlds as server costs for e-learning technology. Pedagogical issues remind readers about constructivist models for learning by doing and leveraging best practices from computer mediated communication. The media battle can be overlooked by sub-stantial results in academic studies on what X  X  working and what X  X  not working. To supplement the ideas, full-color screen-shots are provided throughout the book. Beyond the artistic creativity, the bottom line is that the number of educators active in Second Life continues to grow along with the academic research.

The variety of studies and disciplines included in Higher Education in Virtual Worlds: Teaching and Learning in Second Life gives the reader a good indication of the current state of virtual world simulation and immersive learning potential. Research methods include exploratory studies, case studies, meta-analysis, focus groups, surveys, and mixed-methods. Some chapters include thorough literature reviews on the topic, including description of analysis, findings, limitations, discussion, conclu-sions, and suggestions for further research; however, the style and format is not always consistent and the order many not seem logical.

The book examines computer mediated communication literature, such as managing student impressions and reducing interpersonal uncertainty and asks the question,  X  X  X n virtual worlds how do you know if your students are paying attention? X  Recommendations include using unobtrusive observation, drawing comparisons with others, listening for self-disclosed information, and using the classroom space so students understand immediately how to behave along with using all the forms of communication made available in Second Life: voice, IM, group chatting and group voice to enhance levels of inter-action. The implication that emerges is the teacher needs to initiate techniques with the software to instill the best commu-nication and social behaviors through their facilitation rather than relying on the technology to do it for them.
Immediacy is the nonverbal communication created by proximity, mannerisms, and awareness of others. Four decades of research have shown the positive effects that teacher immediacy has on students derived by: moving around the classroom, making eye contact, smiling, gesturing, speaking without a podium, using a range of vocal techniques, and appropriate touching. The authors discuss their ideas on developing these concepts of immediacy in Second Life focusing on: (1) avatar smiling, (2) vocal variety and expressions in voice and chat, and (3) relaxed body posture defined by an increased use of gestures. Approaching and interacting with your avatar using movement as an attention management technique is an imme-diate implication. The researchers produced some notable conclusions that we would be remiss to not pass on now. First, the instructor X  X  competency in Second Life accounted for 41% of the benefit of nonverbal immediacy. This finding emphasizes the need for virtual world instructors to be competent in using Second Life technology. Furthermore, possessing this com-petency going into the virtual world seems to offset certain negative aspects derived from technology use. And finally, there is a perceived correlation between an instructor X  X  technological competence and their content competence-based on their avatars X  gestures and behaviors. This is an area for further research.

Throughout the book there are insightful takes on Second Life: its potential for fostering cooperative and individual learn-ing; the point that Second Life is a  X  X  X reat leveler X ; the point that  X  X  X irtual worlds can provide students with opportunities that simply would not be achievable in real life X . Discussing the avatar as a personal representation of your virtual self re-quires much more in-depth research. But some evidence identifies the ability to create your own avatar acts as a  X  X  X eveler X  in that everyone starts at the same place, i.e. they do not bring in the baggage they may have with their physical self. This can be useful to engage in performance appraisals, role playing and authenticity of voice. The authors see the removal of  X  X  X ag-gage X  as potentially great.
 rience a more personal, deeper engagement with the material than they do with traditional reading and discussion. Most of the authors recognize that the persona that descends physically from one circle of hell to the other is an intense, visual accu-racy akin to flying to a foreign country and being dropped off in the center of town by a taxi.

 on business education. They discuss that Second Life has its own currency which can be exchanged for physical currency (American dollars, for example) and the implication this can have on business students setting up marketing campaigns, experiencing branding in world and other economic role playing. INSEAD identifies four distinct areas in which business schools can make use of Second Life: (1) communication and public relations as an additional means for the schools to reach out across the Internet, (2) virtual education, the actual use of Second Life in teaching, (3) internal process management and student recruitment, and (4) scientific research. INSEAD designed their presence in Second Life to meet three of these four uses.

In Second Life, the subjects get the benefit of being on stage without requiring a physical stage. Their methodology of combining physical life with virtual life during the study was very similar to having a prompter feed the actors their lines except in this case the prompter was providing expert advice for lines that the student would create. Though not discussed in this book, one of the strengths of Second Life is to use multiple IM channels simultaneously to provide this type of expertise during presentations and performances. The scenario provides for the new creation of a new identity. The student starts out with a real or physical identity and they practice a relationship with the expert or tutor. The student uses a variety of virtual identity characters.
During the process, the student cannot help but to project their real-world values, experiences, and motives onto the virtual character thereby creating a projecting identity. This projective identity provides the foundation for a follow-up discussion between the student and the tutor. There is a hint of cognitive therapy in this type of interaction.
 surprisingly, include frustration of using text-based chat for conversations which was an intentional design component, but caused participants to feel like anonymous. Students also felt frustrated because they knew Second Life was voice capa-ble. One participant complained of cognitive overload from not only having to think of what the response would be but then having to type it. The authors identified two issues regarding the social and interactive nature of appraisals in Second Life: first, the lack of facial expressions which were exacerbated by the loss of tone of voice that could have expressed some reac-tion, and second, the greater impact of their partner X  X  avatar X  X  appearance as it X  X  not easy to see your own. The authors acknowledge that they could have implemented gestures to address the first problem; however, Second Life currently does not offer a view of yourself at the same time you are looking at others. The research palette addressing social, cognitive and pedagogical issues invites further investigation.

The Open University (OU), which has a long and respected tradition in e-learning and innovation, provides a glimpse into one of the most important chapters in the book. OU knows the key attribute of teaching virtually is a well-run class envi-ronment. OU quickly discovered that if you did not provide classrooms on private sim islands that non-enrolled avatars would drop by the class. However, the strength of Second Life is its access to people worldwide which causes OU to recom-mend that any higher education institute obtain at least two islands, one for classes for secured managed instruction and, and one for social networking.

Besides teaching, OU recognized that staff development is as important as content development. Fortunately for educa-tors, the development workshop is the focus of this chapter. OU took an unusual approach in using a blended design of phys-ical and virtual experience. The staff in training collaboratively takes turns controlling the avatar as the authors believe this method increased the development benefits. The blended design enabled participants to experience how Second Life could facilitate the development of skills that were useful in physical life. Though there is much excitement at OU about the won-ders of Second Life, OU has adopted the mature view that Second Life is just one of the tools in the toolkit and should not be used for solving all higher educational problems. OU is quite aware that Second Life facilitates  X  X layfulness X  and as a critical motivator for learning, OU is finding ways to design playfulness in and not out.

Learning is a life-long endeavor, and the book acknowledges the lifelong learner and the importance of age in the com-munity of learning. The authors acknowledge that virtual worlds, such as Second Life, provide a means for life-long learning, providing a place to develop co-presence, and providing a context for considering how new technology can enrich older lives. This study recruited approximately fifty senior citizens to partake in a 6-week one and half hour training session. The authors identified two co-evolving systems: social and technical. The user X  X  ability to see themselves in social context increases the development of co-presence and embodiment. The study was successful as the participants X  perceptions of vir-tual worlds increased tenfold. They understood Second Life well enough to initiate conversations with other seniors long after the training was complete. One senior recounted a conversation a month after the class about being able to get beyond the discussion of Second Life being a game and into how it could improve one X  X  life. Participant X  X  use of Second Life dimin-ished after the course, however, because many of the individuals were retired and did not feel a need or a meaningful pur-pose to direct a goal of accomplishment. One participant wrote,  X  X  X e are in a third age; we do not have to be productive anymore. X  This study showed that Second Life can be adopted at any age level, but that meaningful purpose is critical to continued involvement.

For the reader, the advantages of the innovation are sometimes paradoxical. For example, the use of an avatar levels the playing field for those with physical impairments or disabilities, yet limits diversity and may be viewed as deceptive. An-other dilemma which can be seen as either advantageous or actually dangerous is the huge range of creative possibilities in Second Life. Nearly anything imaginable can be created with or without application of physical science laws. People can fly, physics can stop working, and chemical and biological effects are not part of the engine underneath creating an unpredictable environment from a scientist X  X  point of view. All academic disciplines could benefit from simulations (e.g. health, art, history) that are more realistic, but the technology is lacking in many areas that would benefit educators. Many studies report that participants believe interaction and collaboration are benefits of Second Life, but on the other hand the lack of facial expressions and body language are mentioned as drawbacks to communication. It X  X  important to note that it is the work arounds to these constraints that are contributing to the literature and the imagination of the educator.
Literature on Second Life often refers to the  X  X  X igh learning curve X  associated with maneuvering within the environment and using available tools within the virtual world. Much of the user X  X  time is spent learning the mode of the innovation itself before meaningful application or learning content can take place. Factors such as the level of skills and amount of time each participant spends in Second Life present a challenge to researchers when analyzing data regarding perceptions.

However, something is afoot in the virtual world that is transformational. Students are unconstrained by place, by time, by culture, by language, and by politics. 3D imagery is communicative beyond the textbook because all the objects in the virtual world can be programmed for communication, interaction, and unique avatar interaction. Process can be visually laid out so students follow a distinct path, while 3D environments can be fashioned to represent a specific time and place and allow students to transcend time or economic constraints in an experiential nature. Observation of the student and the fac-ulty, attention management, question and answer management, long-term study of behaviors all become possible in this place where people show up and stay for extended periods of time. This is different than a physical place, different from a textual place, and different for an instructional experience that has a learning objective and a test. Learning to shape it, embrace it and augment it is our next task.
 In summary, Wankel and Kinsley have provided a resource that validates the potential for education in virtual worlds. Reluctant administrators and educators who are unfamiliar with the topic may be interested in the variety of research and programs taking place. The editor cautions the reader at the beginning that if educators ignore this technological trend, they do so at the peril of their professional credibility. For educators curious enough to have become early adopters, the vir-tual world is a real place that is connected to everyone, everywhere in a mode that is currently embraced by millions of dig-ital natives both young and old around the globe. The potential is enormous and the guidance that this book provides is revealing.
