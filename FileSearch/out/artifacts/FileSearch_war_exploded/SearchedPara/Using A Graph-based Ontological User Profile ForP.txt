 In this poster, we describe a personalized search approach, which involves a graph based user profile issued from on-tology and a session boundary recognition mechanism. The user profile refers to the short term user interest and is used for re-ranking the search result s of queries in the same search session. The session boundary recognition is based on track-ing changes in the dominant concepts held by the query and the user profile. Experimental evaluation was carried out using the HARD 2003 TREC collection and shows that our approach is effective.

In web information retrieval, most search engines use the document content or the document structure in the informa-tion retrieval (IR) process. Such systems provide the same results for the same keyword queries even though these lat-ter are submitted by different users with different intentions. The main reason behind this is that the search process is made out of the user context.
 Personalized IR tackles this problem by integrating the user profile that refers to the user interests in the IR process. There have been several attempts at building a personalized or contextual search engine [2, 3] or session based search engines [4]. We propose a search personalization approach which consists of building and maintaining the user profile in order to re-rank search results of queries in the same search session. Our approach has the following new features: http://www.dmoz.org
We learn a graph based user profile issued from the ODP ontology by aggregating graph based query profiles over a search session. For each query q s submitted by the user at time s , we build the associated query profile G s q as a graph of semantically related concepts of the ontology. First we identify the user X  X  documents of interest D s using implicit feedback measures and create the query context K s as fol-lows: where w td is the weight of term t in document d computed using the tf*idf weighing scheme. Then, we map the query context K s on the ontology using the cosine similarity mea-sure as follows: where each concept c j of the ontology is represented as a sin-gle term vector c j issued from the web pages classified under this concept as described in previous work [1]. Based on the obtained weighted concept set, we activate for each concept its semantically related concepts using score propagation. The user profile is initialized by the profile of the first query submitted in the search session. It is then maintained by merging it with the profile of the new submitted query by accumulating the weights of possible common concepts and adding new nodes and edges issued from the query profile.
We propose a session boundary recognition method us-ing the Kendall rank correlation measure that quantifies the conceptual correlation  X  I between the user profile G s u the query q s +1 . Here, the query is mapped onto the ontology and represented by the concept vector q s +1 c . Wechoosea threshold and believe the queries are from the same session if the similarity is above the threshold. The similarity  X  I is computed as follows.
 ) Where, c i and c j are two concepts issued from both the query and the user profile, q s +1 c ( c i )(resp. G s u ( c weight of the concept c i in q s +1 c (resp. G s u ).
We personalized search results of query q s +1 in the same search session using the user profile G s u by combining for each retrieved result d k , the initial score S i and a contextual score S c as follows: The contextual score S c of result d k is computed using the cosine similarity measure between the result d k and the con-cepts of the user profile G s u as follows: Where c j is a concept in the user profile, score ( c j )isthe weight of concept c j in the user profile G s u .
We have conducted two set of experiments to evaluate the session boundary accuracy and the effectiveness of search personalization. We used the data collection provided by TREC 2 2003 HARD Track. As our approach requires a session based evaluation setup, we simulate a search ses-sion by a single topic and related queries by creating three subtopics of the main topic. For each topic we selected ran-domly a relevant document set called the profile set provided by TREC data. This set is divided into three subsets where the top three representative terms of each subset constitute the subtopic.
We aligned a training subtopic sequence in order to iden-tify the best threshold value for the session boundary recog-nition. First, we computed the Kendall correlations between each subtopic and the user profile built across subtopics re-lated the same topic and obtained values in [  X  0 . 6+0 . 01]. Then we evaluated the session boundary accuracy in terms of the fraction of correctly identified related queries ( P intra and the fraction of correctly identified session boundaries P inter (  X  )foreach  X  value in ([  X  0 . 6+0 . 01]). Results show that the threshold value  X  0 . 34 achieves the optimal session boundary accuracy maximizing both P intra at 53 . 33% and P inter at 85 . 71%.

We evaluated the personalized search effectiveness along a test subtopic sequence using the optimal threshold value (  X  0 . 34) identified above. We compared the personalized search to the baseline search based on the OKAPI BM25 retrieval model. Evaluation m easures are the Top-n recall and the Top-n precision done as follows: Top  X  nRecall = RelDoc n where RelDoc n is the number of relevant documents in the top n retrieved search results, RelDoc total is the total num-ber of relevant documents of the subtopic , by excluding the profile set associated to its topic. Results show clearly a sig-Figure 1: Average Top-n recall and Top-n precision comparison between the personalized and the stan-dard search nificant improvement of personalized search comparatively to the typical search.
In this poster, we described a personalized search ap-proach that builds a graph based user profile in a specific search session. We proposed a session boundary recognition mechanism in order to personalize search results of queries in the same search session. We have also conducted an eval-uation of our approach that shows it effectiveness. It is important to pursue the evaluation to study the user profile accuracy and the evaluation of session boundary using data provided by search engine log file. [1] M. Daoud, L.
