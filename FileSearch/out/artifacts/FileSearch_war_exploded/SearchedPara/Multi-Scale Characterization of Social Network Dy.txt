 We have developed a computati onal framework to characterize social network dynamics in th e blogosphere at individual, group and community levels. Such characterization could be used by corporations to help drive target ed advertising and to track the moods and sentiments of consum ers. We tested our model on a widely read technology blog calle d Engadget. Our results show that communities transit between states of high and low entropy, depending on sentiments (positive / negative) about external happenings. We also propose an innovative method to establish the utility of the extracted knowledge, by correlating the mined knowledge with an external time se ries data (the stock market). Our validation results show that the characterized groups exhibit high stock market movement predictability (89%) and removal of  X  X mpactful X  groups makes the community less resilient by lowering predictability (26%) and affecting the composition of the groups in the rest of the community.

This paper deals with the problem of characterizing communication dynamics of the blogosphere at multiple scales  X  individual, group and community. Secondly, we propose an innovative method to establish the utility of the extracted knowledge, by correlating the mined knowledge with an external time series data (the stock mark et). The problem is important because multi-scale characterization of social networks dynamics could be used by corporations to help drive targeted advertising and to know how they and their products are being received. Communication characterization within a network could also suggest alternative ranking strategi es for  X  X mpactful X  individuals, groups and communities in social networks. Our key observation is that a fine-grained, multi-scale, temporal and the mean minimal delay path of an individual with respect to her neighborhood. We also note th at a person comments based on her independent desire when her comment does not follow another comment within a response time difference of  X  . We also characterize people with respect to several traditional graph based properties: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality and clustering coefficient along with intrinsic roles of people  X   X  X eaders X  and  X  X ollowers X . Group Characterization: Groups are sets of people whose members share similar social network characteristics. The similarity between a pair of individuals is defined using a diffusion kernel. We thereafter deploy an unsupervised clustering based group extraction algorithm [3] known as  X  X utual awareness expansion X  (MAE) to extract groups over each time slice. For each such group, we extract several features. We define the individual characteristics at the gr oup-level so as to characterize the groups at a macro-scale base d on a  X  X roup graph X  which is a social network where each node is a group of individuals. We also define two other group-level char acteristics: assortativity and characteristic path length. We now categorize groups into sets (called  X  X ypes X ) which share simila r group-level characteristics. It is a global characterization, as the group-types are extracted over all time slices. In order extract the group-types we use the spectral clustering algorithm. Community Characterization: A community comprises groups of different  X  X ypes X  related a particular topic. In our work, the topics are taken as the tags of the names of technology companies. We define five different measures to characterize the group-types in a community: te mporal density, conductance, coverage, group-type entropy and size entropy. Temporal density of a group-type in a community de termines how many individuals belong to its member groups at each time slice. Group-type entropy is used to determine the characteristics of a community at a particular time slice based on the frequency of member groups in its group-type distribution; while size entropy is used to determine the characteristics based on the sizes of the member groups. We have analyzed postings on the widely read technology blog, Engadget (www.engadget.com) rela ted to names of technology companies. In order to understand the dynamics of the multi-scale characterization of these topic communities, we refer to several external events related to the companies. Figure 1 gives a temporal representation of the mu lti-scale characterization for the topic  X  X pple X , over a span of 20 weeks from Sep 9, 2007 to Jan 20, 2008. The figure shows (a) the groups at each week (as bubbles), and (b) the group-types that each group belongs to (the colors of the bubbles). We denote these non-communicating people as a white bubble. We observe that the community transits between states of high and low entropy, depending on sentiments (positive / negative) about external happenings. Activity dynamics further show that the community discussing topic Apple is observed to be a moderately responsive community ( r =0.74) where communication is more editor-driven. While another community discussing topic Google is observed to be a consistent, highly responsive ( r =0.73), cohesive and high influence community (  X  =0.69).
