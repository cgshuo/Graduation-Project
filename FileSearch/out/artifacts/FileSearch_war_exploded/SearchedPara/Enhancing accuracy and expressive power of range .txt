Let G D = A for which geometrical information is available, which, for the sake of simplicity, we name as geometrical objects . Let T objects . Furthermore, let R = A  X  Inside  X  E ; B  X  Overlap object E (i.e., A  X  Inside  X  E ); ( ii ) spatial database object B overlaps or meets spatial database object F (i.e., B then the answer to Q , denoted by A(Q) , is the following: A ( Q )={ A , C }, as topological objects in T thatthelatteronewouldbe theanswerto Q retrievedbyany arbitraryspatialdatabaseserver thatdoesnotincorporate anysolution for dealing with incomplete spatial information.

Experimental results
In this Section, we present our experimental results obtained from stressingthe performance of algorithm workstation equipped with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor at2 GHzand 2 GB RAM,and running MacOSX asoperatingsystem.As regards the programming language, evaluateRangeQuery was implemented in C . 7.1.

Furthermore, to ef data structure for geometrical data, and a B -tree indexing data structure for topological relations. obtained as a 1 K sample MBRs from the data sets Iowa , Kansas , Missouri and Nebraska , available at the R geometrical object O i , one topological object O j is built by means of the topological relation O synthetic data set consists of 2 K spatial objects, whose 50 % is represented at the topological level only.
For what regards real-life data sets, we considered the data sets Greece Roads (23,268 MBRs) and Germany Hypsography respect to the original number) represented at the geometrical level. 7.2. Input spatial queries spatial data set considered by the target experiment. This ensures a way we superimpose that there does not exist any  X  favored target (random) population, which would involve in severe biases that may affect the capabilities of our proposed algorithm. 7.3. Classes of experiments
Based on the classes of spatial data sets and queries described in the previous Sections, we devised two different kinds of experiment. The fi rst one is oriented to stress the inference capabilities of algorithm our experimental campaign. 7.4. First experiment: assessment of inference capabilities
Before providing the results obtained for the fi rst kind of experiment, some concepts need to be introduced for a better be easily derived from the other topological relations stored in D (see Section 5 ). Furthermore, on the basis of algorithm evaluateRangeQuery ,if Q involves m topological objects, such that N computed in order to retrieve all the topological relations among involved topological objects and the range R of Q .Asa needed to compute topological relations among involved topological objects and the range R of Q . topological objects involved by the input query Q and the range R of Q , denoted by Time time with the overall time needed to evaluate Q , denoted by Time
Time Q ( Q ). This con fi rms that our proposed technique for querying incomplete spatial databases introduces very low conventional spatial database systems, where such a spatial information would be not retrieved.
Let us now focus on synthetic queries considered in our fi characteristicsoftheunderlyingspatialdataset.Inthisrespect, have been de fi ned. In the fi rst variant, denoted by TS geometrical object. Against this variant, we considered the query class Q the case of queries of class Q I against the synthetic data set TS shows our results for the fi rst kindof experiment obtained when evaluating queries of class Q It should be noted that, in this case, we do not provide comparison with the Heuler-histogram method, as queries of class Q In the second variant of the synthetic data set Tiger Streams , denoted by TS relation Contains with at least one geometrical object. Against TS spatial objects in TS C that overlap a given range R . In this case, the resulting topological relation is Contains (right) shows our results for the fi rst kind of experiment obtained when evaluating queries of class Q values against TS C . As shown by Fig. 7 (right), in this case, since queries of class Q Overlap ), the Heuler-histogram method is considered as comparison approach for this applicative setting. Fig. 8 shows our results for the fi rst kind of experiment obtained when evaluating queries of class Q values against the synthetic data sets SAME (left) and Wet _ USA _ UT (right), respectively.

This completes our assessment related to the the amount of time needed to compute topological relations among topological objects and ranges of input queries, Time negligible with respect to the overall time needed to evaluate queries, Time range queries over incomplete spatial databases is effective and ef modern spatial database servers. Finally, for what regards the comparison of algorithm needed to compose topological relations among spatial database objects is equal to zero), but obtained results con suitability of the technique we propose, as it ensures higher quality and expressive power of answers retrieved by traditional approaches like the Heuler-histogram method. 7.5. Second experiment: assessment of query capabilities
In the second kind of experiment, we stressed the proper query capabilities of algorithm
Heuler-histogram method. Following the general setting of our experimental assessment, for both techniques (i.e., algorithm evaluateRangeQuery and Heuler-histogram method) query cost has been modeled in terms of number of retrieved spatial Formally, given an input query Q and the range R of Q , we denote as NumObj due to evaluating Q . NumObj R ( Q ) fi nally plays the role of metrics in our second kind of experiment.
For what regards the class of synthetic queries considered in the second kind of experiment, we again considered queries of class Q O , keeping in mind motivations similar to those provided for the
Hypsography , respectively. This ensures a fair-enough stressing of the query capabilities of algorithm Fig. 10 shows our results for the second kind of experiment obtained when evaluating queries of class Q database objects retrieved by our algorithm evaluateRangeQuery method only considers geometrical information, and neglects topological information. Contrary to this, our algorithm spatial database, hence it is capable of retrieving a higher number of spatial database objects, hence method. 8. Conclusions and future work
