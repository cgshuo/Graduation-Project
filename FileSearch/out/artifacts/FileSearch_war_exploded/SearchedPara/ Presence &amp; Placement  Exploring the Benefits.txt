 Relatively little is known about how the presence and location of multiple shared displays changes the performance an d dynamics of teams collaborating. We conducted a case study e valuating several shared display configurations with groups c ollaborating on a data-intensive, sense-making task. Teams complete d the same task using either a single display, side-by-side du al, or opposing dual shared displays. The location of the second sh ared display significantly impacted the ability for teams to mak e logical connections amongst the data. Users were also signi ficantly more satisfied with the collaboration process using the side-by-side dual display condition than those using a single display . H5.2. Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): User Interfaces, graphical user interfaces (GUI), miscel laneous. Measurement, Performance, Experimentation, Human Fa ctors Multi-display environments, meeting spaces, large d isplays Recent trends in business data indicate that more p eople, especially managers, are spending even more of thei r workday in meetings [6]. In conjunction, current trends within many companies indicate a shift away from traditional em ployee hierarchies to low, flat hierarchies which use self -managing teams [19]. As a result, team members must often make dec isions together rather than having one made for them. It i s logical to assume that individuals are spending time away from their individual offices working in collaborative spaces.
 Currently, meeting or conference rooms are commonly equipped with a single large display such as a projector or flatscreen monitor along with a whiteboard and table. However, advances in technology and connectivity now allow workers to ub iquitously access information in collaborative spaces. Computi ng devices such as laptops or smart phones may be used to shar e information, presentations, or charts. Thus, meeting spaces seem likely candidates for deploying more than one large displa y to support collaborative information sharing. Several research lab applications have incorporated multiple large share d displays into their environments [1, 16, 23], but multiple shared displays do not appear to have yet gained widespread deployment in everyday meeting rooms. While research has shown the benefits of multiple d isplays for users working on individual workstations [11], we w onder if multiple large, shared displays offer similar benef its to groups of people collaborating within meeting environments. O r, do such displays provide an additional drain on limited cog nitive resources? Existing research within the multiple-di splay environment (MDE) community regarding collaborative spaces typically examines the software infrastructure fram ework and interaction techniques used to share information. F urthermore, evaluation of MDEs often uses performance-based tas ks, such as tracking tasks, or focuses on single users. In cont rast, we examine the impact of the presence of and location of shared displays on a meeting process involving multiple participants. In our controlled user study, we evaluate participants performing a s ensemaking task to simulate one type of activity that occurs w ithin meetings. We seek to understand how the presence of shared di splays can impact the group sense-making process. Finally, we also discuss user attitudes, constraints, and limitations of suc h environments. Meeting spaces, due to the interaction between indi viduals, technology, and information, represent an intriguin g research domain not only for technology researchers, but als o to the management, business, and psychology communities. I n this section, we present relevant related work under thr ee themes: research on group decision support systems (GDSS) w ithin the management information science community, collabora tive tasks, and multiple display environment (MDE) research. The management information systems (MIS) community extensively explored group decision support systems (GDSSs), where a centralized computer system facilitates the exchange of ideas, opinions, and preferences within a group [10 ]. These systems may provide modeling and mathematical techn iques or apply rules to the meeting process. However, some s ystems simply support communication amongst the group. In an overview of GDSS research, Fjermestad and Hit z report conflicting evidence whether these systems impact t he amount of time it takes for a group to reach a decision [8]. Gallupe and DeSanctis [10] found that GDSS usage did not affect the decision-time for complex tasks, but Bui and Sivasa nkaran [3] found that groups performing a low-complexity task using a GDSS actually required more time than individuals n ot using the system. It is not clear, for example, which compone nts of a GDSS offer advantages to users. In this paper, we examin e one particular aspect of a GDSS X  X hat of shared displays X  X nd its im pact on the meeting process. Furthermore, a survey of research within the MIS co mmunity indicates that most evaluation studies use fewer than five individuals per testing session, even though prior research shows GDSS system usage is more beneficial for larger gro ups [8]. We note within the HCI and CSCW community, empirical s tudies of collaborative settings often investigate smaller gr oups. For example, the study evaluating Roomware [25] used gr oups of four participants. In the study described in this paper, we conducted testing sessions with five or six individuals. The psychology and MIS communities have extensively researched the types of tasks people perform while collaborating. Poole et al suggest that the type of task may account for up t o half of the variance in group performance [20], and furt hermore, it is not uncommon for many groups to collaborate in diff erent ways. McGrath developed a classification scheme for the t ypes of tasks groups typically perform, consisting of eight types within four categories [17]. Surprisingly, a survey of research conducted within the community indicates most studies cluster ed heavily within two of the eight genres; Fjermestad and Hilt z report that 52% of studies focused on decision-making tasks , where there is no definitive answer or objective measure of qualit y [8]. The second-most frequently used task in studies was creativity (i.e. brainstorming.) In this study, we chose to use an intellective task, where a solution to a problem exists. Our particular task, described in more detail later in this article, provides groups with a large data set in which solutions to a problem were embedded. We sought to simulate the types of activities we observed occurring in meetin g spaces where multiple people come into a room with information t o share with other individuals. In addition, this type of task s imulated certain aspects of sensemaking activities occurring in visu al analytics [27], an emerging field combining information visua lization with data analysis techniques. Visual analytics involves making sense of large data sets, where some data may be conflict ing, in order to locate expected patterns as well as discover new co rrelations. However, to control variables in our study, we did not provide participants with any specific visualization tools. Research on MDEs has focused on both individual and shared environments. Czerwinski et al showed task performance benefits of using multiple displays for individual users [5] . Other research explored how individuals manage information while u sing multiple displays, finding that users often organiz e content in terms of primary and secondary importance [11, 13]. For example, content that does not have active focus is often re levant to a user. In this study, we explore how groups use multiple d isplays in collaborative environments; do they also divide con tent up in terms of primary and secondary importance, for exam ple? Several visions of futuristic meeting spaces explor ed large, shared display usage, such as the Interactive Workspaces p roject [16] and iLAND/RoomWare [23, 24]. More recently, researchers developed the IMPROMPTU framework to assist users i n sharing information across displays using off-the-shelf pro ducts, supporting opportunistic, short-lived collaborative moments [2]. Much of this body of research focuses on the develo pment of specialized software architectures facilitating inf ormation sharing across multiple devices and displays. Note, however , that many of these systems satisfy the definition of a GDSS sinc e they support the exchange of ideas, opinions, and preferences in a group. Evaluation of systems supporting MDEs typically foc uses on interaction techniques [e.g. 12] and interface repr esentations [e.g. 1]. Much of this body of research focuses on the de velopment specialized software architectures allowing informa tion sharing across multiple devices and displays. Other MDE research evaluated display positioning. I n [28], researchers provide guidelines for positioning disp lays with respect to the surface used to provide input to the system. Their study involved participants using a tablet to perfo rm a docking task, using a stylus to select and move objects on a screen. This type of task is considered performance and psycho-motor in nature, using McGrath X  X  framework. Similarly, Su an d Bailey X  X  work on creating guidelines for positioning large d isplays in interactive workspaces also used a target-task duri ng evaluation and also focused on single users [26]. In this stud y, we evaluate display presence and positioning via the routine an d ubiquitous act of sharing content from a laptop via shared dis play [18] while individuals perform a sense-making intellective task. Furthermore, building upon this existing work, evaluation occurs using multiple individuals for each session. Finally, several studies also explore the effects o f technology use on group work. For example, Streitz et al . conducted an empirical study comparing different Roomware configurations X  impact on the collaboration process, finding individuals with access to both computer workstations and a Liveboard produced high er-quality work during a brainstorming exercise [25]. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of presence of and location of multiple shared displays on a simulated meeting environment. Specifically, do dual-shared displays in meeting spaces increase the amount of insights discovered b y group members during a sense-making task? Does a second s hared display increase the potential for parallel work du ring the collaboration process? We acknowledge there are a p lethora of different configurations and variables that could b e tested and each of these variables may influence how displays are used. For the intents of this study, we sought to limit exter nal variability as much as possible, focusing specifically on the thre e display configurations. We discuss specific design decision s in the following sections. We recruited 105 individuals (26 female) to partici pate in the study. All but three individuals (a restaurant serv er, research scientist, and user experience engineer) were stude nts at a technical university with an average age of 22.8 ye ars ( s = 3.53). Sixty-six participants were in a technology-related major, such as computer science, computational media, or human-com puter interaction, and other majors included industrial s ystems engineering (10), industrial design (4), biology (3 ), biomedical engineering (3), and psychology (3). Student partic ipants received course credit for their attendance. We assigned individuals randomly to a testing condi tion. For this study, it was impractical to find and use existing work groups for evaluation purposes. However, the relatively homoge nous student population did remove a source of uncontrolled vari ance. Student participants were not likely to have adopted a part icular style or meeting role, as might be common within established corporate or academic environments. Since participants did not k now a majority of their group members, special measures w ere taken in the design of the experiment to ensure that all gro up members were familiar with the role of their teammates (as described later in this section). This study simulated an environment in which partic ipants bring in laptop computers containing information relevant to the meeting topic that is likely to be shared. This ac t of sharing is a ubiquitous and routine practice in both industry an d academic meeting rooms [18]. Our goal was not to replace thi s interaction of  X  X howing data X  via sophisticated technologies, b ut to explore how multiple shared displays impact collaborations. Three different configurations of shared displays were ma nipulated as the independent variable: single display, side-by-s ide dual displays, and opposing dual displays, as shown in F igure 1. We selected these configurations to investigate not on ly the effects of adding an additional shared display to the room, bu t also to begin to explore the influence of location. The shared displays consisted of portable XGA proje ctors running at a resolution of 1024x768. For the multiple displ ay conditions, each projected image was calibrated to be identical in physical size (approximately 1.2 meters diagonally). Due to the logistics of coordinating these sessions, we omitted a condition without any shared display, noting that many existing meeting s paces contain one shared display. We provided each session with six laptop computers running only a fresh installation of Windows XP and Microsoft Of fice. Each laptop was preloaded with a unique Microsoft PowerP oint presentation containing information required to sol ve the task (described in detail in  X  X rimary task X ) when used i n conjunction with information from other laptops. Furthermore, e ach laptop connected to an Altinex programmable video matrix s witch. We placed a control box (see Figure 2) next to each laptop to control the video switch. These control boxes consi sted of a physical on/off button to enable mirroring content from a laptop onto a shared display. Pressing a button resulted i n the button illuminating and the content being shown on the res pective shared display (i.e. left button controls the left shared display). In the single display condition, a sleeve was placed over the second control button. A shared display could be blanked b y a participant pressing the respective control button a second tim e. This switching system allowed individuals to quickly con nect and share content onto one of the shared displays. We acknowledge that several software-based solution s [e.g. 18] have been built by researchers, however none of the se systems are widely used outside of research lab applications. T herefore, we opted to use this off-the-shelf video switching sol ution. Also, this physical interface required minimal training and wa s easily learned by participants during pilot testing. Again , we sought to simply provide a quick method for individuals to mi rror the content of their laptops on the large shared displa ys. We furnished the meeting space with a large confere nce table, six chairs (three on each side of the table), a portabl e white board, and two-level fluorescent lighting. The conference table seated a maximum of three individuals comfortably on each si de of the table allowing for six participants per session. We kept lighting at mid-illumination to reduce glare and improve readab ility of the projector and provided participants with whiteboard markers, eraser, pens, and paper. We provided a scenario based upon  X  X he Bonanza Busi ness Forms Company Case X  [15], used in evaluating a GDSS [10]. The scenario posed to participants follows: Bonanza Business Forms Company sells paper forms fo r three markets: small business, hospitals, and financial i nstitutions. During the previous three quarters, Bonanza X  X  profi ts were steadily decreasing while total sales were increasi ng. Bonanza X  X  management cannot determine the cause of the declin ing profits, so they decided to bring you in as outside investig ators. The goal of the outside investigation team is to determine t he cause of the company X  X  problem using a series of reports, charts , and data to identify why the problem is occurring. We defined six investigator roles: domain researche r, industry trend analyst, sales force consultant, financial an alyst, marketing consultant, and advertising trend consultant. Withi n an experiment session, participants were randomly assi gned a role. For this study, we modified the original business c ase to create PowerPoint presentations for each investigative rol e. Information was provided in the form of bulleted information, c harts, and graphs. To provide a sense of realism, we formatted the graphs to appear in the default Microsoft Excel font and colo r scheme. Each role X  X  slides were unique, thus it was not possible to accurately determine solutions to why Bonanza X  X  profits were d ecreasing amidst increasing sales without individuals sharing information with each other. Pilot testing indicated the scenario was solvable, yet not trivial, and did not require any specific management or busi ness training. Pilot testing also indicated a potential problem re sulting from the unfamiliarity of participants with every member of the group. This had the side effect of participants losing tra ck of which role each person had. A person might, for example, want to see information pertaining to the advertising budget bu t forget which participant had the role of advertising consultant. To alleviate this problem, a colored band was incorporated at the top of each slide, coding and labeling each investigator role. Corresp onding colored placards were placed on top of each participant X  X  l aptop. Procedure: Experiment sessions consisted of six participants ( full team), however, all three experimental conditions h ad one team in which a participant failed to show up. Rather than dismissing the remaining five participants, we chose to run those respective studies with five participants. We discuss these se ssions in more detail later. At the beginning of a session, we randomly assigned participants to a laptop computer and administered informed cons ent and a demographic survey. The experimenter read an introd uctory script, outlining that the ultimate goal for the te am was to determine why Bonanza X  X  profits were decreasing whi le sales were increasing. We instructed the group to solve t he problem using any strategy they wished and introduced them to the whiteboard, paper, and video-sharing technologies. Furthermore, participants were told that all the information nee ded to solve the problem was provided. We also allowed participants to use any of the other built-in software applications if they wi shed, such as the calculator or notepad programs. The experimenter instructed each group to hand in a list with their answer or answers to the business case dilemma. To encourage groups to be thorough and efficient, we offered a $20 per person incentive to the group that solved the scenario mos t correctly in the shortest period of time. Finally, after reaching group consensus, each parti cipant individually completed a closing survey. The purpos e of this survey was to obtain attitudes towards the meeting process as well as agreement with the group decision. We collected data via a combination of surveys, int erviews, and video analysis. Each experiment session was videota ped and later coded at one-second intervals to determine 1) which slide was displayed on the shared display(s), 2) who was spea king, 3) who was gesturing towards a display, and 4) who was wri ting on the whiteboard. Furthermore, we transcribed the dialog from each testing session. We sought to evaluate group collaboration performan ce in the various display conditions using the metrics of performance , collaboration , and satisfaction. Aspects of collaboration and satisfaction were probed through surveys and interv iewing. To evaluate performance, we used an insight-based methodology to evaluate each group X  X  collaboration, based on [22]. An insight refers to a direct observation from the information provided that is relevant to solving the dilemma posed in the primar y task. Examining the number of insights discovered by the teams offered a richer way of exploring collaboration habits than simply measuring time-to-completion. The main challenge wa s establishing objective metrics over what constitute s an insight. We consulted two individuals with formal business e ducation training: a 29-year-old project manager with a degr ee in business administration, and a 30-year-old Masters in Busine ss Administration student. Each individual read throug h the case study and generated a list of insights presented in the task that lead to the decrease in profits at the fictional co mpany. These raters assigned weighted values to these insights. Since these ratings were highly correlated, we combined them to establish an objective grading rubric to judge accuracy, complet eness, and thoroughness of each group X  X  collaboration session.
 Furthermore, we defined five important inferential links , where groups correctly join two particular insights (i.e. the number of sales for X remain steady [ insight 1 ] while the total dollar amount of sales for X is increasing [ insight 2 ] the amount of each sale is increasing [ inferential link ]). As stated earlier, we sought to evaluate group coll aboration performance in the various display conditions using metrics of performance , collaboration , and satisfaction. For performance, we investigated trends in discoveries of insights. For collaboration metrics, we considered both quantitative measures, such as whiteboard usage or deictic gesture [4] rates, as w ell as qualitative findings emerging from transcript analysis. We prob ed for satisfaction of the meeting process via surveys and interviews. Each experimental condition consisted of five full teams of six participants at a time. All three experiment condit ions had one team in which one participant failed to show up. Si nce each laptop contained only six slides of information and the pa rticipants would be assigned course credit regardless, we chos e to run those sessions with five participants. We instructed thes e groups to double-up on laptop computers as the group deemed f it. Our analyses showed that performance metrics for these groups did not differ substantially from the teams of six; results were within one standard deviation from the mean. Therefore, we opt to include data from the sessions with five participants in th e study analysis, noting that a majority of studies evaluating variou s group support systems used fewer than 5 participants [8]. Since the number of groups per condition is limited , we use a general comparison of trends as an analysis. Howeve r, we offer inferential statistical analysis when appropriate t o also provide useful indicators of trends. To explore the effect of display condition on perfo rmance, we examined the rate of insight and inferential link d iscoveries amongst the groups. We counted the total number of insights and inferential links for each group, as shown in Figur e 3a and Figure 3c. However, the time for each group to reach conse nsus varied considerably per group, with a mean time to complet ion of 33 minutes across all groups. For example, one group i n the side-by-side display condition reached consensus in just ov er 8 minutes while another took over 45. This wide variation is perhaps the greatest challenge in performing laboratory studies involving groups and collaboration; the way individuals inter act with each other as well as establish a rapport may vary consi derably. To account for this variation in time-to-completion , we calculated an insight rate metric by dividing the number of in sights discovered by the amount of time it took to reach c onsensus to obtain an insight rate. As Figure 3b illustrates, t he average insight rate is highest for groups in the side-by-side disp lay condition. However, this condition also has the greatest varia nce. The rate of insight is lowest for individuals in the single sha red display condition. 
Figure 3. Count of insights (a), insight rate (b), and count of inferential links (c), and time spent on slides wit h insight content (d). (* indicates a significant difference in performance, and average number of slides viewed per minute. Y-a xis arrows There was a significant effect (F(2,17)=4.448, p=.0 30) on the number of inferential links made per display condit ion. A post hoc analysis indicates that participants in the side-by -side condition correctly identified significantly more inferential links than those in the opposing display condition. Although the ave rage number of inferential links was lower under the single dis play versus the side-by-side condition, this difference was not sta tistically significant. We also analyzed the amount of time groups spent di splaying slides on the shared displays. An ANOVA analysis yi elded a significant difference in this factor (F(2,17)=8.09 9, p=.004). Groups in the opposing dual display condition spent a significantly larger percentage of their time showi ng slides containing insights on a shared display than those in the single display condition or side-by-side display condition . To evaluate collaboration, we coded the videotape o f each session for gesturing and whiteboard usage, each an act tha t involves interaction with other individuals in the testing p rocess. Research has shown that individuals often use pointing gestu res during collaboration to clarify or enhance a message [9], as shown in Figure 4. We counted each instance of deictic gest ure towards the display via coding of the videotape of each session . Likewise, our video analysis also noted when a group member stood and actively wrote on the board. Groups in the single shared display condition used the whiteboard more frequently than in any other condition (Table 1). Whiteboard usage served primarily as a way to make note of themes or insights. They were also used as persiste nt information displays while the group performed an analysis of t he scenario. The group that used the whiteboard for the longest amount of time in the single display condition did so to analyze t rends in the PowerPoint Slides and combine graph trends. Deictic gesturing towards the shared display was ob served across all experiment conditions. To account for the wide range of completion times, we calculate a gesture rate, as s hown in Table 2. An ANOVA analysis yielded statistical significan ce for gesture rate across the conditions (F(2,17)=6.364, p =.010) . Groups in both multiple display configurations had higher ges ture rates than those in the single display configuration. However, the average length of a gesture was similar across conditions: 2.8s, 2.2s, and 2.6s for the single, side-by-side, and opposing dis play conditions, respectively. To further probe issues of collaboration, we examin ed the video and transcripts of each collaboration session using inductive techniques to understand commonalities and themes i n the data. In conjunction, the independent raters also inspected the transcripts. In particular, themes revolving around how the seco nd shared display impacted collaboration within the meetings emerged. One of the independent raters noted commonalities a mongst of shared displays usage:  X  There was an understanding of a shared display as a group resource which someone had to co mmand. If a second display was present, it looked like it could be employed in various ways . X  We explore these themes within this section. Use of multiple displays for exploration : In this style of collaboration, a group member would notice a partic ular trend on one of the slides on his or her laptop computer and call the groups X  attention to this trend by showing the slid e on one of the shared displays. Other group members would then con sult their own information and determine if they had charts, d ata, or information pertaining to the original insight and show this information on the adjacent display. One participan t articulated this exploration strategy early on in his group X  X  a nalysis:  X  Let X  X  try to piece together a little bit of what our prob lem is and then we can put on information from different sources fo r resolution. To start off, we are looking for a reason why profi ts have steadily decreased. X  This style of exploration appeared in the both sid e-to-side dual display condition and the opposing dual-d isplay condition. Another style of exploration used the second displa y to actively cycle through another group member X  X  slides to sear ch for correlations as a group. This exploration occurred more frequently in the side-by-side dual display condition than the opposing dual-display condition. Side-by-Side 1 06:07 ( 00:33 ) Side-by-side 1.1 0.94 2.2 
Figure 4. A group member calling attention to the s hared Use of multiple displays to engage : Groups frequently consisted of very different personalities, some people being more outgoing than others. Groups with multiple displays were obs erved to use the second display to engage a participant who had not been very vocal. For instance, in one group, a participant as ked another,  X  Is there anything in sales that can help us [explain this insight]. X  Another group member asked another,  X  You X  X e financial. What do you have regarding healthcare? X  specifically inviting individuals to use the second display. Using multiple displays to transition group discuss ion . The multiple display conditions also offered participan ts an opportunity to segue the dialog to a new topic or i nsight. On several occasions, if one display was blank or its contents stale (not updated in a while and not the focus of the cu rrent dialog), an individual would simply share content on that displ ay, other individuals would take note, and then a new explora tion would begin. Opposing displays used to segregate content . We observed group members using opposing displays to host two differe nt insights. One participant remarked that it was useful to keep different insight themes physically dislocated. In Figure 5, the participant in the foreground and an obscured participant have their attention focused on one display, while other group members h ave their attention towards the other display. Several trends emerged regarding the collaborative style of the meetings under the different display conditions. On e rater noted that there was a sense of high-level discussion occ urring within the side-by-side groups with periodic delving into more details. Discussion within single display groups was describ ed by one rater as often being  X  X loddy. X  Individuals would in terrupt a current conversation thread to request to see a dif ferent chart, an occurrence not as common in the multiple-display co nditions. For example, one individual interrupted his own train-o f-thought:  X  and if you look at sales X  X an you go back to the sam e graph? X  There were also many explicit requests for informat ion to come up, resulting in frequent switches of ownership of the display. On several occasions, individuals attempted to verball y describe some data to be interrupted by  X  put it up [onto the shared display ] X . Although this occurred within the other display con ditions, it appeared much more common under the single-display condition. In the multiple display conditions, group members o ften seemed to be pro-active in mirroring information onto one shared display without being told to or asking permission to take control. Several interesting collaboration activities occurr ed under the single-display condition. In one instance, a group subdivided into different groups on each side of the table and proc essed information in parallel before collaborating. In an other group, individuals broke down into small groups of similar roles to share information before collaborating with the rest of t he group. Furthermore, as noted earlier in this section, most of the whiteboard usage occurred within the single-display condition. We explored satisfaction with the collaboration pro cess via surveys and interviewing. Participants in the side-by-side condition significantly ranked their satisfaction w ith the meeting process higher on a Likert scale than those in the single-display condition (F(2,103)=3.610, p=.031). (Note, one part icipant failed to answer that survey item). We also interviewed each group about subjective fac tors regarding the shared displays. Across all condition s, individuals enjoyed the ability to share information in a quick and lightweight manner. For example, one remarked  X  The projector allowed open discussion on the available information X  Another stated,  X  X t was nice, very fluid. It allowed sharing with zero over head. X  Another individual stated that the shared displays facilita ted  X  rapidly direct[ing] the group to slides for comparison. X  Six negative comments centered primarily upon an occasional lag in the switching device.
 Single-display users noted a desire to have a secon d display to facilitate comparisons amongst the data. When asked of what additional resource would have improved the group d ecision-making process, groups wanted  X  X ide-by-side display s. X  A few individuals went beyond dual displays, desiring  X  X  shared desktop so I could  X  X dit X  things on someone else X  X  screen  X  or a  X  communal whiteboard that could be edited from each person X  X  workstation . X  Several participants in groups that did not use the whiteboard also remarked that using the whiteboard would have been useful in organizing thoughts. The side-by-side display was the only condition tha t had participants actively remark during the group analy sis that they wish they had additional displays.  X  We need more than two screens [to explore this]....we need like six. X  The desire for more displays was echoed in the post-experiment surveys as a way to further assist groups:  X  Two screens is not enough; 4-6 might be better. X  One individual went even further, stating that  X  only being able to compare two people X  X  slides at a time  X  inhibited the generation of ideas within the group. Others remark ed that the side-by-side configuration had the benefit of  X  show[ing] correlation between two ideas and give supporting e vidence towards similar ideas. X  However, one participant did note that drawback of the side-by-side configuration was pote ntial ambiguity:  X  You were not sure which display someone was talking about. X  The interviews for the opposing display participant s illustrated utility in having multiple displays, but there was an overwhelming 
Figure 5. Example of split attention in the opposin g display desire to have the two displays on the same plane, supporting Su &amp; Bailey X  X  guideline that displays should not be or thogonal to each other. One participant remarked that,  X  what was distracting was having the displays on opposite sides of the ta ble, making it harder to compare data, X  taking away from the meeting experience. Participants remarked that they did not like looking back-and-forth, however, two participants noted tha t they were able to determine which display people were talking about simply by seeing which location people were looking at. The presence of multiple displays influenced how gr oups completed the sense-making task in our study, suppo rting Su &amp; Bailey X  X  findings that different configurations of large displays impact users differently on their tasks. We note, h owever, that due to the controlled nature of this empirical study, r esults cannot be easily generalized to other situations and future w ork needs to further explore these findings X  X or example, how wou ld performance results change if the groups consisted of 10 individuals? However, in conjunction with other wor k regarding display placement, such as Wigdor et al [28] and Su and Bailey [26], designers can use our results when considerin g placement of shared displays in collaborative spaces. We offer f our themes supported by the findings in this paper when consid ering supporting an intellective, sensemaking task: 1. Placing multiple shared displays side-by-side of fers performance benefits as opposed to placing displays at opposing ends of the table. With respect to display condition, our results show that groups in the side-by-side shared display configurations were able to make more inferential links between insights than those groups in the opposing shared display configuration. Examining th e videotapes and transcripts yielded more exploratory comparison s of information when the dual displays are side-by-side . Interestingly, groups under the opposing-display configuration spe nt significantly more time displaying slides containin g insights than groups in the other two conditions, yet were not ab le to make these inferential links as often. Su and Bailey note that displays should be position ed at a 45-degree or lower angle relative to each other, notin g that an orthogonal configuration of two displays correlated to lower performance on task times. Similarly, in this pape r, the opposing display configuration tended to have lower performa nce. However, as noted in the previous section, the oppo sed configuration allowed groups to leverage the physic al disparity to focus on different issues. A potential benefit of t his arrangement that merits future exploration is to determine whet her opposing displays facilitate group members in making more ey e contact with each other, potentially impacting the social c omponent of the meeting process. 2. Side-by-side shared displays offer similar cognitiv e benefits to using a single shared display with a whiteboard, su ggesting analog technologies still merit inclusion in meetin g space design. Our results showed the ability to share information side-by-side via multiple shared displays is perceived beneficia l for groups performing an intellective task compared to opposin g display conditions. However, we note that the ubiquitous me eting room configuration of a single shared display and whiteb oard offered similar performance characteristics in our study, s uggesting that meeting space users will adapt collaborative strate gies to the technologies, both analog and digital, provided wit hin a space. This is noteworthy for technology designers as a re minder to not dismiss properties of existing spaces that serve as useful tools. At first, we were surprised by the lack of a signif icant difference between the side-by-side and single display groups regarding inferential links. We hypothesized that the side-by -side display configuration would explicitly support comparing an d exploring data. Our analysis of the session transcripts showe d evidence of comparisons and explorations in multiple shared dis play groups and also indicated that groups with the side-by-sid e displays tended to have high-level discourse while groups us ing the single display were typically more abrupt. Therefore, it s eems logical that the smoother collaboration styles combined wit h easy comparison of slides should have resulted in a perf ormance boost. However, note in Table 1 that groups under the sing le display condition used the whiteboard more frequently than under the other two display conditions. These groups used the space to organize thoughts, trends, and themes emerging from their analyses. Interpreting the whiteboard usage through distributed cognition [14], and in particular Salomon X  X  classif ication scheme [21], we argue that the white board serves as a phy sical object off-loading the cognitive efforts of the team exploring the data set. This phenomena is shown in Figure 6. For those in t he side-by-side display condition, members appear to be perfor ming an act of shared cognition by viewing side-by-side comparison s of information, data, and slides. Groups under the opp osing-display condition generally did not use the whiteboard, and due to the disjoint location of displays, were not able to sha re in cognition as well as their counterparts under the side-by-side c ondition. Such a distributed cognition interpretation also pr ovides evidence supporting Streitz et al  X  X  point that technology designers need to not only consider the software and technology aspec ts of meeting spaces, but the physical aspects themselves [25]. W ithin meeting spaces, physical whiteboards are examples of  X  X nfor mational devices X  [25] since they facilitate creating, editi ng, and displaying information. Our research provides evidence suggest ing why existing meeting spaces have not fundamentally chan ged over time; the basic  X  X ools X  provided, both digital and analog, can be appropriated as necessary during collaboration. Fur thermore, it is Figure 6. Single display condition group using the whiteboard possible to interpret another finding using a distr ibuted cognition approach. The opposing dual-display group members s pent significantly more time showing slides containing i nsights on the shared display than the other two group conditions support this theory, yet did not demonstrate any substantial per formance gains. These groups generally did not use the whiteboard t o offload the cognitive efforts of drawing comparisons and correl ations amongst the data set. They also did not have the ad ded benefit of shared cognition for side-by-side analysis. Therefo re, it seems reasonable to assume that these groups spent more t ime on these slides continually recalling information and previo usly discovered insights rather than drawing logical connections be tween them. Future work seeks to explore the notion of shared c ognition with multiple shared displays in meeting spaces. For thi s study, we included a whiteboard to replicate this common amen ity found within conference rooms. Further studies can remove the whiteboard from the space to examine how shared cog nition changes under various multiple display configuratio ns. 3. Multiple-shared displays offer opportunities for individuals to engage team members. Multiple shared displays impacted the social protoc ol of the meetings by allowing for new ways for individuals t o interject or segue the group discourse. Generally speaking, grou ps in the side-by-side shared display conditions flowed and intera cted more smoothly than groups under the other two conditions . In particular, groups under the single-display conditi on had an erratic flow where individuals would abruptly talk about their data instead of sharing it visually. It appears that thi s was also partly due to social factors X  X id an individual deem their insight was important enough to requisition control of the larg e display? Many meeting situations have implicit or explicit p ower relationships that may impact how likely someone is to request  X  X wnership X  of a shared display. Evidence of social norms affecting the flow of coll aboration also appeared in the multiple display conditions. When a n individual shared content on one display in a multiple display setting, another individual could display content on the sec ond idle/stale display without usurping conversational focus. This also allows shyer group members a lightweight method to introdu ce their content into the group analysis. Conversely, having multiple displays also prevents one individual from dominati ng the group conversation. Future work will further explore how multiple shared displays can influence the social dynamics o f other meeting situations X  X or example, can such displays b e deployed to engage more team members. We also note that the presence of multiple displays had a significant impact increasing the number of pointin g gestures towards the displays. Therefore, this notable incre ase in gestures for the multiple display conditions may be interpre ted as a method to assist group members in resolving the potential ambiguity of which display X  X  content is in focus. Gesturing is a lso used to point out comparisons between content shown on both displ ays. There was some indication in the opposing display c ondition that these displays can be used to support parallel disc ussion, perhaps by physical proximity to each display, even though this did not explicitly occur in the experimentation. However, t wo participants remarked that one benefit of the opposing display c onfiguration was to use the physical separation to keep analyses between two different insights separate. Interestingly, the onl y group that showed evidence of breaking down into smaller group s for parallel work occurred in the single display condit ion. The opposing display configuration did offer severa l unique characteristics. The location of these displays gav e participants an additional cue to determine which display another g roup member was looking at (i.e., Figure 5), alleviating some o f the ambiguity. However, this did not seem to impact the rate of po inting gestures between the two dual display conditions. This displ ay configuration, however, seemed to promote more eye contact with individuals as they changed attention focus from on e side of the room to another. Our camera angles, however, did no t allow for us to easily or accurately code for this. 4. An insight-based evaluation offers a useful way to evaluate team collaboration under controlled circumstances. Finally, we comment on the methodology we used for evaluating displays in meeting spaces. Collaborative settings offer inherent challenges for technology evaluation. Existing rese arch investigating display placement under controlled se ttings such as [26, 28] used performance tasks (i.e. target-based) in their evaluations. This research offers insight into one specific type of collaborative task, and performance tasks are also fairly easy to implement and evaluate. However, many other complex or information-centric tasks occur during collaboratio n [17]. Our work contributes a novel way to analyze how multipl e individuals come together to make sense of a large amount of in formation that may be overwhelming at first, a task that frequentl y occurs in meetings [e.g. 27]. However, as noted in Saraiya et al, an insight-based analysis is quite labor intensive and require s domain experts [22], and it is still difficult to control for vari ance in how well randomly assigned individuals will work together, s till representing a challenge to the research community. Our empirical study showed that presence and locati on of multiple shared displays influenced how groups performed a c ollaborative analysis on an analytical, sense-making task. Group s using the side-by-side dual shared display condition were abl e to identify significantly more inferential links amongst insigh ts while problem-solving than those in the opposing dual-dis play condition. This difference occurred even though gro ups in the opposing dual-display condition spent significantly more time showing the slides containing the insights on the s hared displays. In addition, people in the side-by-side dual displa y condition indicated a significantly higher rating for satisfa ction with the meeting process. We also provide qualitative eviden ce for previously undocumented ways groups use multiple sh ared displays to collaborate, engage others, or organize information content, and evidence that the presence of multiple displays changed social protocols in the meeting. This paper contributes to the HCI community as an e mpirical investigation of the impact of multiple shared disp lays within a meeting environment. We also used an insight-based evaluation method where multiple group members performed an in formation-intensive intellective task and provided evidence t hat the shared displays themselves play an important role in influ encing the collaboration that occurs in such spaces.
