 } The Web today includes many pages intended to deceive search engines, and attain an unwarranted result ranking. Since the links among web pages are used to calculate authority, ranking systems would benefit from knowing which pages contain content to be trusted and which do not. We propose and compare various trust propagation methods to estimate the trustworthiness of each page. We find that a non-trust-preserving propagation method is able to achieve close to a fifty percent improvement over TrustRank in sep-arating spam from non-spam pages.

In the early days of the Web, a web search engine could be per-fectly objective, examining only the content of a page and returning those pages whose content best matched the query. However, the growth of the Web meant that thousands or millions of pages were often considered relevant, leading to the use of links as votes or recommendations to estimate the authority of web pages.

With some knowledge of how search engines function, it is pos-sible to manipulate the results of a search engine query by adding keywords to the content or by creating links from other pages to the target page.The use of such techniques, called search engine spam, can lead to inappropriately high rankings for the target pages while degrading overall query results.

Traditional link analysis techniques consider the content and links on all pages. However, given the adversarial nature of today X  X  web, it would be advantageous to know which pages are trustwor-thy, so that they may be promoted in authority calculations [5].
Gy  X ongyi et al. X  X  TrustRank [4] was one of the first mechanisms to calculate a measure of trust for Web pages. It is based on the idea that good sites seldom point to spam sites and people trust these good sites. It uses a human-selected seed set of highly trustworthy nodes, and then calculates a personalized PageRank [1] in which all jump probability is distributed only to the seed set: where TR ( i ) is the TrustRank score for page i and  X  is the seed set. TR ( i ) will be initialized to 1 |  X  | if i  X   X  and 0 otherwise. Gy  X ongyi et al. iterate 20 times with d set to 0.85.

Those pages that are reachable via the directed graph from a seed node accumulate some trust; the better linked a page is to the seed set, the higher the trust score calculated. TrustRank promotes trust-worthy pages, and demotes untrustworthy pages (e.g., spam pages). However, it is not clear that trust should flow in the same way as authority (as demonstrated by Guha et al. [3] in a person-to-person trust network). More recently, Wu et al. [6] proposed using differ-ent mechanisms to propagate trust among web pages. In addition, they incorporated distrust into the model using reverse propagation.
In this poster we demonstrate 1) the creation and use of a novel trust evaluation metric that incorporates spam and non-spam page measures; and, 2) the comparison of propagation mechanisms for trust and distrust, and their combination in a unified model.
TrustRank propagates trust identically to how PageRank propa-gates authority. While the use of a known seed set is valuable, we consider here some alternatives to the usual method of propagation. The first is, for each parent, how to divide its score amongst its chil-dren ( X  X plitting X ). The other is, for each child, how to calculate the overall score given the shares from all of its parents ( X  X ccumula-tion X ). In the case of TrustRank, a parent X  X  trust score is equally distributed among its children, and a child X  X  overall trust score is the sum of the shares from all of its parents.

In particular, with respect to trust splitting, we question the need to give less weight to recommendations made by one entity simply because the entity made more recommendations. One straightfor-ward alternative is to grant each child the full measure of trust as-signed to the parent rather than equally splitting. Thus, we consider the two choices: Additionally, in either case, a child X  X  trust need not be simply the sum of the parents X  trust. An alternative is to use the maximal trust sent by any parent. We investigate both choices for accumula-tion: Simple Summation (Sum) in which we sum the trust values
