 The retrieval results of online products information in e-commerce web sites are often difficult for users to use be-cause of different descriptions for the same product. This paper proposes ProductSeeker, a product retrieval system organizing results according to their referring real-world en-tities for the conveniences of users. In the demonstration, we will present our system providing friendly interface to retrieve fresh product information and refining results ac-cording to feedback.
 H.4 [ Information Systems Applications ]: Miscellaneous Entity Resolution, Information Retrieval, E-Commerce
People often buy products online from e-commerce web sites such as ebay (www.ebay.com), Amazon(www.amazon.com) and Taobao (www.taobao.com). These web sites are thus a rich sources of products which are convenient for users to find required products. Retrieving proper products for users is however a challenging task as the names of the same product are often different especially in web 2.0 sites such as ebay and Taobao where products are described by various users instead of professional managers. For the convenience of users to find proper products and compare the prices for the same products from different sellers, it is necessary to group the products referring to the same real-world object together. This is the task of entity resolution [1], which is to recognize the data objects referring to the same real-world entity.

Even though many techniques have been proposed for en-tity resolution, most of them are not designed for products on e-commerce web sites, the object descriptions in which are in great diversity. [2] focuses on the entity resolution component re-clusters the products according to the user feedback.

We briefly introduce the techniques of entity resolution, cluster labelling, cluster ranking and feedback.

Entity Resolution For effective entity resolution, we ex-tract attribute set from product titles and description infor-mation. Initially, all attributes share the same weight. The similarity between two products is defined as the similarity between corresponding attribute sets. We also use classifi-cation information from original web sites. Two products within a class and with the similarity larger than a thresh-old are considered to satisfy the relationship of referring the same real-world object. The entity resolution performs clus-tering based on such relationship.

Cluster Labeling Each cluster could be described with common attributes of attribute sets in it. To extract the most representative feature for each cluster, we use TF/IDF model to assign a scores on each attribute. The two at-tributes with the highest scores in each cluster are used as the label of each cluster.

Cluster Ranking We define the rank function for the clus-ters as the weighted sum of three parameters, i.e. the simi-larity between clusters and keywords, the average similarity between pairs of products in the cluster as well as the num-ber of products in the cluster. Clusters are ranked according to the rank function. In each cluster, products are ranked according to the orders in data sources.

Feedback We use two kinds of feedback information. One is changing the cluster of a product p from C 1 to C 2 .It means that the changed product has lower similarity with the products in C 1 but larger similarity than C 2 .Thusthe weights of attributes shared by p and the products in C 2 are increased while the those shared by p and C 1 are decreased. The second is that during one query, the weights of common attributes of products clicked by users are increased.
We plan to demonstration ProductSeeker in understand-ing the principles of entity-based search as well as the im-pact of its accuracy. Since ProductSeeker runs a wrapper on existing e-commerce web site with a search input box, our system can process keywords in open fields. To demonstrate the features of our system, we have prepared a set of key-words with multiple related products and some of products with more than one descriptions such as X  X mart phone X , X  X in-dle X ,  X  X evi X  X  X  and  X  X amy X . Users can also input any keywords for the search.
