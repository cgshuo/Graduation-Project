 Ten years ago, KDD research was still in its infancy in China. Things have changed significantly. With the push from the technological advancement in academia and the pull from the explosive growth of application needs in indus try, KDD research is flourishing. At Microsoft Resea rch Asia, we have been conducting research in many areas related to KDD research, including web search, data mining, information retrieval, multimedia mining, natural language processing, and visualizatio n. In addition to publishing papers in KDD and developing technologies for commercial products, we have also contributed to the talent development in China by supervising students and growing young researchers who later become well known in the field relat ed to KDD in universities and industries . At Microsoft Research Asia, we have many groups working on KDD related research. Our major contributions are in the following areas:  X  Entity -level Web Search: We developed the first technique to analyze Web pages using visual cues and use the information to model the Web and extract structured data from Web pages. With these advanced Web -analysis techniques, we developed a next -generation search engine that goe s beyond traditional page -level relevance ranking. By extracting and integrating information about real -world entities such as people, places and things (e.g. products) from billions of public Web pages, our system creates a paradigm shift on Web search by enabling search queries, relevance ranking, and browsing and navigation of search results at the level of entities. We also built the Microsoft academic search engine based on entity -level search technologies. It provides many innovative ways to retrieve rank and explore scientific papers, conferences, journals, and authors based on their importance and relationship. (MSRA member: Zaiqing Nie, Ji-Rong Wen, Wei -Ying Ma)  X  Search Infrastructure for Web -scale Data Mining and  X  Relevance in Web Search: Relevance is one of the most  X  Interactive Knowledge Mining through Crowdsourcing: called iKnoweb that enables users to interact with and contribute to automated knowledge mining tools such as entity extractors and name disambiguation systems. The system interacts with user s to retrieve the knowledge in their minds and keeps learning through interacting with people. As more users interact with the system, more knowledge will be accumulated. More user interactions also help make the system more powerful and human task easier. (MSRA member: Zaiqing Nie)  X  Knowledge Base: We have put considerable efforts on building knowledge bases and using them to support a wide range of applications. Projects such as Pr obase focus on building general -purpose knowledge bases, and we also have efforts on creating domain-specific knowledge bases. It is our belief that in order to make applications more intelligent, data mining techniques need to be able to integrate and manipulate human knowledge. We have been using these techniques and knowledge b ases to improve search and ads related applications. (MSRA member: Haixun Wang)  X  Graph Data Mining: We have developed a series of technologies to perform data mining (cluster and rank) on large -scale, information -rich, and heterogeneous graph data. In KDD 2005, we published a technology to co -cluster star -structured Web data. We formulated the problems as the fusion of multiple pairwise co-clustering sub -problems with the constraint of the star structure, and proposed the concept of consistent bipartite gra ph co-partitioning, and developed an efficient algorithm based on semi -definite programming. In KDD 2006, we published a technology to detect events from click -through logs based on the evolution pattern in the data. We proposed a dual graph representation for the data, which can encode both semantic information and temporal information into its structure and metadata. We then designed a two -phase graph cut algorithm to partition the dual graph for event detection. In KDD 2011, we published a parametric gr aph ranking technology to optimize the ranking in a large -scale graph with rich metadata, according to partial supervision. We show that it is possible to efficiently learn the optimal parameters of the model and the optimal ranking scores of the nodes usi ng a MapReduce framework, by leveraging the sparsity of the graph. (MSRA member: Tie -Yan Liu, Hang Li)  X  Search Log Mining: Several advanced and ground -breaking methods of search log mining have been proposed from our team. For example, we proposed algorithms for query clustering and query expansion based on the click -through bi-partite graph, which are among the first studies on the issue and are highly cited in the community. The work on context aware search based on mining of search logs initiated a new approach to web search and one of the papers won the best application award paper at KDD X 08. (MSRA member: Ji-Rong Wen)  X  Behavioral Targeting (BT): BT aims to understand the user interests, tasks as well as preference through mining the user profile and us er behavioral log. We aim to deliver the right ad and right recommendations to the right audience at the right time. Though this area is relatively young in KDD, it is attracting increasingly attention from both academia and industry due to its huge market potential. We have published a book chapter and many papers which have influenced  X  Urban Computing: We launch ed the project of urban KDD is going to have a bright future. We know statistics -based approaches have achieved great successes in the last dec ade. For example, machine translation based on statistical models of big data is revolutionary both in its approach and in its effectiveness. I consider these triumphs are a celebration of the success of KDD, machine learning, and AI in the past decade.
 Th e coming decade is going to be more challenging and more exciting for KDD. As we celebrate its success, we also need to acknowledge its current limitations. For example, statistics -based approaches still do not  X  X nderstand X  the meaning of the problem. This affects both the depth and breadth of the problems that statistics based approaches can handle. Thus, how to effectively of treating it as a huge, flat array of independent features migh t be the biggest challenge for KDD and machine learning.
 As for the future of web search and mining, there will be more opportunities for disruptive innovations. For example, emerging consumer devices such as smartphones and tablets are increasingly drivin g user activities into apps and services that offer superior capabilities for the completion of tasks. In addition, many such technologies do not necessarily live inside the traditional web browser. The new generation of mobile devices, equipped with a var iety of sensors and location -based technologies, is connecting people to information not only in the virtual world, but also in the physical world by bridging between the two. Social networks are also being integrated into search, making it easier to find answers and share information, while natural user interface technologies such as touch, voice, and information access beyond the traditional search box. These new trends and their profound impac t on how people interact with information will unlock many new opportunities for researchers in KDD to take the field to a new height.
