 We discuss the art of applying theory to practice. In partic-ular, we discuss in detail our interactions with two research projects at IBM Almaden: the Garlic project [4], which built a multimedia database system on top of various existing sys-tems, and the Clio project [19], which developed tools for converting data from one format to another. We discuss the problems we resolved, and the impact this had both on the Garlic or Clio systems and on the broader scientific com-munity. We draw morals from these interactions, including why theoreticians do better theory by working with system builders, and why system builders build better systems by working with theoreticians. We present the remarkably sim-ple Threshold Algorithm [16], which is optimal in an ex-tremely strong sense: optimal not just in the worst case, or in the average case, but in every case! The Threshold Algo-rithm and its variants have applications to numerous areas, including information retrieval [20], fuzzy [2] and uncertain [17] databases, group recommendation systems [1], and the semantic web [18].
 F.2 [ Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complex-ity ]; H.2 [ Database Management ] Theory, Algorithms Ronald Fagin is an IBM Fellow at IBM Research X  X lmaden. The title of Fellow is IBM X  X  highest technical honor: there are about 70 Fellows among 450,000 IBM employees, and there have been 246 Fellows in the 50 year history of the program.
 Fagin received his B.A. in mathematics from Dartmouth College, and his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley. In his Ph.D. thesis [5], he essen-tially initiated the field of finite model theory. In his thesis he proved what is now known widely as Fagin X  X  Theorem [6], which says that the important complexity class NP co-incides with the class of properties expressible in existential second-order logic. This is a syntactic characterization of NP, which, remarkably, does not involve explicitly any no-tion of machine, computation, or time. In his thesis, he also proved the zero-one law of first-order logic [7], which says that every property expressible in first-order logic is either almost surely true (in an asymptotic probabilistic sense) or almost surely false.
 Most of his research has focused on database theory. He first became well-known in databases through his introduc-tion of the strongest normal forms for relational databases [8, 9]. Normal forms describe ways to structure the rela-tions to avoid various anomalies (such as the deletion of one piece of information accidentally leading to the loss of other information). Normal forms are critical for good database design. In recent years, his main focus in database theory has been on the problem of data exchange [10, 13, 14, 15], where data is translated from one format to another. He has also been a key leader in the area of reasoning about knowledge, a topic of importance in distributed computing systems, artificial intelligence, cryptography, and game the-ory. These subjects all deal with systems in which multiple agents are reasoning about the world and about each other X  X  knowledge. Fagin is a co-author of the definitive text on rea-soning about knowledge [12].

He was named a Fellow of ACM for  X  X reating the field of fi-nite model theory and for fundamental research in relational database theory and in reasoning about knowledge X .

He was named Docteur Hon-oris Causa by the University of Paris, and a  X  X ighly Cited Researcher X  by ISI (the Institute for Scientific Information). He won Best Paper awards at the 1985 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence [11], the 2001 ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems [16], and the 2010 International Conference on Database Theory [3]. He won Test-of-Time Awards at the 2011 ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems [16] and the 2013 Interna-tional Conference on Database Theory [13].
