 1. Introduction
Sharing name authority data not only cuts down on labor and other costs but also increases convenience for national and international users. Hence, cooperative programs, such as the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), are gaining signif-and Korean-speaking (CJK) countries. However, in the current state of affairs, in which the LC/NACO Authority File (LCNAF) has only a short history in dealing with Chinese characters, and where most participatory organizations of the VIAF are from outside CJK countries, it is unclear whether authority data from CJK countries can be treated the same as that from Western requires identifying the differences among the authority data within CJK countries.

The purpose of this study is to compare the representations of Japanese personal and corporate names in Japan and mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and the Library of Congress (LC), in order to demonstrate the differences between them, and to bring to light further issues in the sharing of name authority data among CJK countries and other  X  countries. This is the first attempt to compare representations of Japanese authors X  name authority data that are created in a wide range of CJK countries, and to present problems to be solved when sharing Japanese authors X  name authority data. The word  X  X epresentation X  in this paper means differences in writing systems as well as differences in spellings within a writing system.

For this purpose, the author collected actual data, manuals, formats, and case reports about Japanese personal and corporate name authority data in CJK countries. Supplemental inquiries via e-mail and face-to-face interviews were also conducted. Subsequently, five check points considered to be important in creating Japanese name authority data were set. Then, using the collected information, each organization was investigated from the five perspectives. Vietnam writing systems are excluded from this study because of lack of information.

After a summary of the backgrounds and relevant works provided in Section 2 , a detailed methodology of this study is offered in Section 3 . In Section 4 , the existing conditions of authority control by geographic areas are provided. Following conclusion of the analysis.

Background and related work 2.1. Writing systems of author names in the Chinese character cultural sphere
In the Chinese character cultural sphere, an area including China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, people use or used Chinese characters for their official writing systems. However, the languages spoken in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam are different from that spoken in China; therefore, these countries did not simply adopt Chinese characters, rather modifying their usage and character forms or inventing new characters to write their own languages.

In Japan, hiragana and katakana syllabaries (known collectively as kana ) were developed from Chinese characters during the early Heian period (794 X 1185) ( Onishi &amp; Miyamoto, 2009 ). Since then, Japanese has been written in a mixture of Kanji means  X  X apanese characters X .

Korea has had its own script, called Hangeul , since 1443 ( ILCAA, 2005 ), and has used both Hangeul and Hanja (Chinese characters). Nowadays, Hanja is not used often by Korean people in their daily lives. However, their names can be written in both Hanja and Hangeul on birth registration forms or in official family registries in South Korea. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau use traditional Hanzi . On the other hand, mainland China has officially used simplified tains fewer strokes. For example, the characters for  X  X attle X  are written as  X  traditional script. Both scripts are slightly different from Kanji or Hanja scripts. For instance,  X  X attle X  is written as  X  Japanese Kanji and  X   X   X   X  in Korean Hanja .

Romanization of a given Chinese character (an example would be the character meaning  X  X orest X ) can be different in Man-darin, Cantonese, Taiwanese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese because of differences in pronunciation ( Harrison, 1992 ).
Even though some names in the Chinese character cultural sphere look the same because they have the same Chinese char-acters, their pronunciation varies from region to region; hence, their romanized forms also should be different. 2.2. Features of Japanese personal and corporate names
Since 1875, all Japanese people have had both surnames and given names. Nowadays, the number of Japanese surnames has been determined to be about 290,000 ( Niwa, 1996 ), which is many more than the 23,813 surnames in China ( Yuan &amp; Qiu, 2010 ) and the 286 surnames in Korea ( Korea, Statistics Korea, 2000 ).

Kanji is used to write a large majority of Japanese surnames; a smaller number is written in hiragana or katakana ( Niwa, jihyo  X  , 3 and the others are specified in an appended table of Kosekiho  X  seko  X  kisoku .
 means  X  X ld letter shapes X  ( Takebe, 1979 ).
 venient and inadequate for conveying Japanese people X  X  names. In order to lessen public discontent with this system, an ap-pended table was established for Kanji , designated specifically for personal names, to which Chinese characters were added
The Ordinance on Commercial Registration has a policy regarding corporate names. Until October 31, 2002, the Ordinance banned the use of roman alphabets or Arabic numerals for corporate names, but it has been allowed since November 1, 2002 ( MOJ, n.d. ). Put simply, Japanese scripts for personal and corporate names became further diversified.
Most Kanji has more than one pronunciation: so-called yomi , which are usually represented in either hiragana or kata-kana . People must provide yomi for Kanji when they submit birth registration forms or business applications to show how these names should be pronounced in Japan. In general, even when the same Kanji are used, they identify different indi-viduals when their yomi are different. As just explained, for Japanese personal and corporate names represented in Kanji , yomi information is considered to be very important. In library catalogues, yomi is written principally in katakana .
There are also several types of Japanese romanization systems, and controversy between the advocates of the rival sys-tems has continued ( Palmer, 1931 ). Two main romanization systems are used today in Japan: one is the Hepburn system, which is also called the modified Hepburn system in Western countries, and the other is the kunrei-shiki system. Kunrei-shiki by the Hepburn system when  X  X nternational relations and situations with prior precedent in which a sudden spelling reform would be difficult X .

On the other hand, Japanese people are obliged to romanize their names using the Hepburn system on their passports, in line with Ryokenho  X  seko  X  kisoku (the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Passport Act).
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan for Japanese passport applications (hereafter referred to as  X  X OFA Hepburn X  reasonably considered more as a set of principles, something that serves as the bedrock of a specific Romanization method,
It can be said that there are no unified rules governing romanization systems for Japanese nomenclature. 2.3. Need for sharing CJK name authorities
The LC/NACO Authority File (LCNAF) has been maintained by the Library of Congress (LC) and by National Authority Coop-erative Program (NACO) participants. Non-Latin vernacular forms, such as Chinese characters, appeared in the  X  X eference fields X  of authority records in LCNAF from 2008; however, the addition of non-Latin data was and is optional for NACO par-ticipants ( LC, 2008a ). Although participants in the CJK NACO Project contribute their CJK authority records to LCNAF, the numbers of records is still less than one per cent of all NACO members ( Onnagawa, 2009 ). The numbers of records that can be used with no local editing for libraries in CJK countries still seem small.

In 2005, an agreement was signed between OCLC and the Joint University Librarians Advisory Committee (JULAC), a con-sortium of academic libraries in Hong Kong, to make the JULAC Hong Kong Chinese Authority Name (HKCAN) authority file available to OCLC Connexion clients ( JULAC, 2010 ). Unfortunately, the agreement was not renewed, and the HKCAN authority file has not been available in OCLC Connexion since April 7, 2013. One of the reasons that the agreement was not renewed was the inception and expansion of VIAF ( Patton, 2013 ).

VIAF is a system that links together authorized forms of names and titles among authority files of national bibliographic agencies and other regional agencies, and lets users search and display names of a given entity in various languages and scripts ( Tillett, 2002 ). Although the National Diet Library (NDL) of Japan started to participate in VIAF in October 2012 ( NDL, 2012a ), other organizations in the Chinese character cultural sphere have not yet become involved. Furthermore, wrong links to Japanese names sometimes surface in the VIAF, as Fig. 1 shows. In heading no.1,  X  X ayashi, Yoshitsugu X  is linked to two Japanese names  X   X  ,  X   X   X  and  X   X  ,  X   X   X . However, although their birth years are the same, actually they are very different people. This shows that it can be difficult to maintain accuracy in linking names that use Chinese characters, and users in CJK countries cannot place full trust in the VIAF as of now.

Aiming to develop a basis for Chinese name authority data sharing, the Cooperative Committee for Chinese Name Author-ity (CCCNA) was established by the China Academic Library &amp; Information System (CALIS) Administration Center, the National Library of China (NLC), and JULAC in 2003 ( CCCNA, 2003 ). CCCNA has launched the Chinese Name Authority Joint
Database Search System, which can search authority records created by NLC, HKCAN, the Chinese Name Authority Database (CNAD) in Taiwan, and CALIS together. 8 In December 2011, the National Central Library of Taiwan (NCL) changed the bibliographic and authority format to
MARC21 ( NCL, 2011 ) and is currently reviewing the possible implementation of Resource Description and Access (RDA), which is based on Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) and Functional Requirements for Authority Data (FRAD) ( NCL, 2012 ). NDL also changed their formats to MARC21 in January 2012 ( NDL, 2010 ) and decided to adopt RDA for Western books beginning in April 2013 ( NDL, 2013a ). This development suggests that in time, RDA may promote unification of the cataloguing code in the Chinese character cultural sphere.

Since many bibliographic databases support Unicode these days, the problems pertaining to character codes have been  X  X lmost solved X  already ( Miyazawa, 2002 ). The appearance of VIAF and FRAD gave libraries all around the world full recog-nition of the significance of authority data sharing. Moreover, these developments certainly were a move toward sharing and linking the authority data of the Chinese character cultural sphere beyond national or regional levels. 2.4. Related works for authority control among CJK countries
Although the need to understand the situation of authority control in CJK countries was recognized in the early 2000s,
Kong and Taipei, and to meet the needs of the East Asian library community and OCLC CJK users, Yu (2002) made an eval-uation and analytical study of three authority files under development in those three cities. Yu compared the scope, size, format, character code, headings, and rules of the three files, and then analyzed the compatibility and usefulness to OCLC CJK users of the three databases. Yu X  X  may well be the first detailed comparative study covering authority databases from
Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. However, it was mostly concerned with Chinese names. Hu, Tam, and Lo also pre-Lo, 2004 ).

In South Korea, to develop a Korean authority database system for academic information, O compared certain aspects of in Korea and did a more lengthy comparison than O did, including forms of Japanese headings ( Yi, 2012 ). As these studies pointed out, forms and contents of authority data differ in organizations and are not standardized in Korea. Yi also suggested that a national authority database and a cooperative structure are needed.
 As an initial attempt at sharing name authority data in CJK countries, a workshop titled  X  X uthority Control among Chinese,
Korean and Japanese Languages X  was held at the National Institute of Informatics (NII), Japan. The workshop was held three times between 2001 and 2002. In the workshop, specialists from the NDL and NII of Japan, the National Library of China, the
National Library of Korea (NLK), the Korea Education &amp; Research Information Service (KERIS), and LC reported their own methods for developing authority data ( Naito, 2004 ). Unfortunately, further cooperation did not take place after the work-shop. Naito showed how Japanese personal names are displayed in CJK countries in a short report on the workshop, and pointed out that these variations create and drastically increase a lack of integrity for retrieval precision ( Naito, 2004 ). Kimura conducted a study to clarify the differences between representations of Chinese personal and corporate names in
CJK countries ( Kimura, 2013 ). With regard to Japanese names, comparative research on authority data created in a wide range of CJK countries has not yet been conducted. 3. Methodology
In the present study, the author will demonstrate differences in the representations of selective Japanese personal and corporate names in Japan, China, South Korea, and LC. The purpose of this study is to compare the representations of Japa-nese personal and corporate names in CJK countries and LC, to demonstrate the differences between them, and to bring to light further issues in the sharing of name authority data among CJK countries and other countries.

Issues on sharing name authority data are ideally divided into three parts: representations, data elements, and data mod-els. How organizations in CJK countries adopt data elements, such as birth date, gender, and address shown in FRAD in their authority data, also should be investigated because they help author identification. These will be studied separately. FRAD ship X . However, writing systems of Japanese, Kanji and yomi for example, are not in such a simple relationship ( Kimura, submitted for publication ). Thus, the FRAD data model might be enhanced or re-constructed to include such important rela-tionships for CJK names in the future study.

Individuals might be identified by identifiers, not by name strings. In fact, approaches to identifying individuals by unique numbers or URIs, such as VIAF and ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier), are increasing ( McEwan, Angjeli, &amp; database, and string matching provides an easy, simple method for matching, even if any identifiers are introduced. Since it is a basic and unavoidable issue concerning data sharing, the author deals with only the problem of the representations of Japanese names in this study.
 The methodology involves the following steps: 3.1. Organizations studied
The author explored authority control practices in major organizations that create CJK authority data, namely, the Na-Chinese Authority Name (HKCAN), the National Central Library (NCL) of Taiwan, the National Library of Korea (NLK), and
Seoul National University Library (SNUL). Their data or manuals were comparatively easily to access for reference. Addition-ally, to verify how Japanese name authority data are dealt with in North America, the LC was also included as a research object. The authority data from these nine sources provided the basis for analysis in this study. 3.2. Step 1  X  Data collection
Actual data collected in this step include those provided by NACSIS-CAT and Keio, and searched results derived from authority databases and OPACs. As for NACSIS-CAT, 1,517,926 name authority records made from January 1, 1986, to Decem-ber 31, 2009, and extracted in March 19, 2010, were provided for the research. Keio also provided four sample records that were representative of Keio X  X  records in February 2012. Headings included in bibliographic data searched on OPAC of Keio liographic data searched on OPACs were used as an alternative to authority records. Authority data linked to bibliographic headings in NCL OPAC were also used. The author used 11 personal names and five corporate names to reflect the known characteristics of Japanese names as found in different romanization schemes. These are listed in Table 1 as search terms for authority databases and OPACs. All authority databases and OPACs support Unicode.

As noted earlier, Japanese romanization has two main systems. Thus, the author selected names in which romanization may differ between these two systems. The differences include long vowel pronunciations, the moraic nasal (letter  X  X  X ), and the moraic obstruent (small  X  X su X  in Japanese). Reasons why the respective names were chosen are also shown in Table 1 . Some names did not appear in a specific database. A similar name was used in such cases.

Collected manuals and formats are shown in Table 2 . In addition to Table 2 , information included in e-mail responses from CALIS, HKCAN, NCL, and SNUL, and answers from face-to-face interviews with NCL and NLK were used. The author sent inquiry e-mails to these organizations in 2012, and all responses were received in the same year. The interviews with NCL and NLK were conducted in August and September of 2013, respectively. 3.3. Step 3  X  Setting checkpoints which are unique to Japanese authority data pects, which are assumed to be treated differently by organizations in representing Japanese personal and corporate names, are provided for investigation 9 : (1) Character forms of Kanji . (2) The relating of yomi to their corresponding Kanji . (3) Treatments and types of romanization. (4) Representations in local languages outside Japan. (5) Names in hiragana .

These five topics for investigation were determined as follows. The first topic, character forms of Kanji , pertains because most Japanese personal names are in Kanji . While some Kanji have the same forms as simplified or traditional Hanzi or Kor-ean Hanja , others do not. Japanese personal and corporate names should be written in Japanese Kanji , and it should thus be investigated whether Japanese Kanji are accurately used for authority data in China, Korea, or LC.
 occurring in Japanese Kanji , because the study aims to investigate representations of Japanese names in all CJK countries.
The second topic, the relating of yomi to their corresponding Kanji , is studied because yomi , which shows how the Kanji should be pronounced, is important. One Kanji may have several yomi ; thus, a name in Kanji and its yomi are treated as a pair in Japanese names.

The third topic, treatments and types of romanization, has to do with examining the different romanization forms used by organizations because, as noted above, there are two prominent methods of Japanese romanization. The author also con-ducted a preliminary investigation to estimate how differences in romanization affect VIAF matching. The fourth topic, representations in local languages outside Japan, aims to show what kinds of local representations for Japanese names X  X ther than Japanese Kanji , hiragana ,or katakana  X  X re adopted in China and Korea.

The fifth topic, names in hiragana , is to investigate how Japanese names in hiragana are managed. In China and Korea, though character forms are different, Japanese Kanji can typically be converted into their own Chinese characters. However, names in hiragana and katakana cannot be replaced by Chinese characters, as they represent only sounds. It is necessary to investigate how these names are dealt with in China and Korea. In this study, only names in hiragana are investigated be-eign or foreign-derived words. 3.4. Step 4  X  Identification of issues affecting data sharing
In the fourth step of the study, five topics for investigation were determined by comparing the authority control practices of each organization using collected information. This study places weight on actual authority data. However, since data from some organizations were unobtainable or indeterminable, such compensations as manuals are used against any defi-ciency. For such information, the source will be made clear as much as possible in the text. The result of the fourth step is data are provided in Section 6 . 4. Current practices and policies of authority control in each area 4.1. Current practices and policies of Japanese personal and corporate authors X  name authority control in Japan Several organizations generate their own authority data in Japan: NDL, NACSIS-CAT, Keio, Toshokan Ryutsu Center Co.,
Ltd. (TRC), and Nippan Library Service, Co., Ltd. (NTS) ( NDL, 2004 ). NDL does authority work for personal names, family names, corporate names, place names, titles, and subjects. As of December 2012, NDL had 790,176 authority records for per-sonal names and 184,955 authority records for corporate names ( NDL, 2013b ).

NDL originally used their own format, called JAPAN/MARC format, for bibliographic and authority data. In January 2012, concurrent with the replacement of their business system, NDL started to use MARC 21 formats ( NDL, 2010 ). Authority data from NDL are provided via the Web NDL Authorities .

Most university libraries in Japan maintain their own local catalogues using shared cataloguing (both bibliographic and authority) data from the NACSIS-CAT system. It should be noted, however, that linking headings in bibliographic records to authority records is optional ( NII, 1987 ). This means that not every organization participating in NACSIS-CAT does authority control. The NACSIS-CAT authority file has records for personal names, corporate names, conference names, and titles. As of
April 2013, NACSIS-CAT had about 1.61 million personal, corporate, and conference name authority records, and 32,575 title authority records ( NII, 2013 ). The system uses an original format called CATP format ( NII, n.d. ) for bibliographical and authority data.

Keio did not generate authority data between 1998 and 2011, when the old library system started, and April 2011, when the new library system was launched ( Koga, 2010 ). Keio currently does authority work for personal names and corporate names (including conference names). As of July 2012, Keio had about 827,863 records. However, many records are currently under maintenance, since authority records had not been created for the previous 10 years. Keio uses MARC 21 formats for bibliographic and authority data.
TRC and NTS are creating bibliographic and authority data for commercial use. Both companies have adopted their own original format ( NDL, 2004 ). 4.2. Current practices and policies of Japanese personal and corporate authors X  name authority control in mainland China, Hong
Kong, and Taiwan 4.2.1. Mainland China
CALIS is a nationwide academic library consortium funded primarily by the Chinese government. In March 2000, the Chi-nese union catalogue for CALIS members was launched ( CALIS, n.d.-b ), and in September 2003, CALIS started constructing an
Of these, 578 organizations are academic libraries, and 66 are libraries of colleges with specialized courses, and vocational and technical colleges. This means that most CALIS members are academic libraries. An authority database of CALIS, called
CALIS Union Catalog Authorities, has authority records for personal names, corporate names, conference names, and titles
Japanese personal and corporate names. CALIS has adopted the CALIS Union Catalog Authority Format based on UNIMARC for its authority data. CALIS members can download bibliographic and authority records from NACSIS-CAT; thus, many Jap-anese authority records are copy records of NACSIS-CAT.

In the CALIS Online Catalog, bibliographic databases for Chinese, Western, Russian, and Japanese materials are separately constructed ( CALIS., n.d.-c) . Authorized headings are produced for materials in each language; thus, a Japanese, a Chinese, and a Western heading, all authorized, are produced for the same person if the person is an author of materials in all three languages.

The National Library of China (NLC) carries out authority control for personal names, corporate names, conference names, 4.2.2. Hong Kong
As a project of the Joint University Librarians Advisory Committee (JULAC), which is a consortium of eight academic li-braries in Hong Kong, the HKCAN Workgroup was set up in 1999 to establish a union database  X  X hat would reflect the unique characteristics of the Chinese authors and organizational names X  ( JULAC, n.d. ). HKCAN unified about 140,000 authority re-cords from member libraries; since then, Lingnan University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have worked to re-move duplications ( Liu, Tam, &amp; Lo, 2004 ). At the moment, the online authority database, HKCAN Database OPAC, is in operation. The database adopted the MARC 21 Format for Authority Data (MARC 21/A) ( Yu, 2002 ).

HKCAN has authority records for personal names, corporate names, conference names, and series/titles. The total number of records is 234,719 as of September 2011. Of these, 161,638 records are of personal names and 26,473 records are of cor-porate names ( Xu &amp; Li, 2012 ). This includes Japanese personal and corporate names.

Hong Kong is a bilingual society, and many authors publish in both Chinese and English; therefore, both Chinese and Eng-lish headings are particularly important in Hong Kong libraries ( Hu et al., 2004 ). However, before HKCAN was established, libraries had chosen various authority record formats and, in particular, made a decision whether to adopt Chinese character headings, romanized headings, or both because the form of authorized headings had differed from library to library ( Chan, Hu, &amp; Lo, 2000 ).

As a result of discussions, to be fully compliant with MARC 21/A and to serve the wants and needs of overseas libraries adequately, HKCAN chose to use field 1XX for LCNAF headings and 7XX (Heading Linking Entry Fields) for Chinese scripts ( JULAC, 2010 ).

In the actual authority workflow, HKCAN members usually copy records from LCNAF and enhance the records by adding names in Chinese scripts to field 7XX and field 4XX (See From Tracing Fields) as appropriate ( Yu, 2002 ). As we have seen above, in following the idea of sharing authority data with Western libraries, HKCAN has been creating authority records in close co-operation with LCNAF. 4.2.3. Taiwan
In Taiwan, the NCL and National Taiwan University Library (NTUL) collectively maintain a shared authority database called the Chinese Name Authority Database (CNAD) ( Lin &amp; Lin, 2011 ). However, the database does not include Japanese names. Both the NCL and NTUL are producing authority data for Japanese names in MARC 21/A format.

According to an interview, NCL has about 1.33 million personal and corporate name authority records, including Japanese personal and corporate name authority records, as of July 2013. However, given that all data were converted from CMARC format to MARC 21 for mat in 2011, problems caused by conversion were reported in linking bibliographic records and authority records ( Li, 2012 ). 4.3. Current practices and policies of Japanese personal and corporate authors X  name authority control in South Korea
NLK, SNUL, Yonsei University Library, and Ewha Womans University Library are known for creating Japanese personal and instituted any form of authority control ( Shim, 2006 ).

NLK started fully fledged authority control in 2000, following the launch of an integrated information system in the Win-dows environment and the establishment of the KORMARC format as a national standard ( NLK, 2006 ). Previously generated authority data were concentrated heavily on foreign authors who appeared in both general and children X  X  book searches in Korea, in Japanese materials, and in Chinese materials ( NLK, 2009 ).

Kim reported that NLK established a new guideline for personal name authority data in April 2012 ( Kim, 2012 ). Conse-quently, Korean name authority data, which had not hitherto been fully constructed, could now be made. According to the interview, NLK produces only personal name authority data, not corporate name data, and it had constructed about 234,641 authority records as of July 2013.

Since April 2009, SNUL has carried out personal, corporate, conference names, series/titles, and subject authority control; they have 323,899 personal name authority records, 22,348 corporate name authority records, 3366 conference name authority records, 24,031 series/title authority records, and 63 subject authority records ( Kim, 2009 ).
Although SNUL, the Yonsei University Library, and the Ewha Womans University Library are participating in the KERIS integrated bibliographic database, KERIS does not have a national-level authority database; each of the libraries, therefore, cate some reasons why authority data have not been standardized among Korean libraries. First, when library catalogues were computerized at the end of the 1980s, there were neither standardized catalogue data to refer to nor a leading orga-nization for computerization; hence, most of the libraries built a MARC database in their own way. Second, the third edition of Korea Cataloging Rules (KCR) only had descriptive rules for monographs, and did not have rules for heading selections and forms ( Park &amp; Lee, 2001 ).

The fourth edition of KCR, published in 2003, also had no rules for heading selections and forms. However, as noted above, in April 2012, NLK established a new guideline for personal name authority data based on FRAD, RDA, and MARC 21/A, which included rules for selections and representations of headings and references as well as attributes for identifying persons ( Kim, 2012 ). This means that a high level of attention was given to the authority data of NLK. 5. Representations of Japanese personal and corporate name authority data in Japan, China, South Korea, and LC 5.1. Adoption and character forms of Chinese characters
The adoption and character forms of Chinese characters when names are in Kanji are shown in Table 3 . Three Japanese organizations use Chinese characters for authorized headings and references. The same is true in the cases of CALIS and
NCL. HKCAN adopts romanization for authorized headings, and equivalent Chinese characters are recorded in Heading Link-ing Entry Fields.

In NLK, Chinese characters are added as designations associated with reference entries whenever differentiations be-tween persons with the same names or clearer identifications are needed ( NLK, 2006 ). SNUL and LC adopt romanization for the authorized headings, and Chinese characters are recorded as reference entries.

The three organizations in Japan adopt Japanese Kanji for entries. CALIS adopts Kanji for Japanese authorized headings, and Chinese simplified and traditional characters for Chinese authorized headings. According to the CALIS manual, autho-rized headings in different languages, but representing the same entity, should be shown together in Authorized Headings Fields (2XXs) under one authority record to ensure user accessibility.

However, in the actual authority database, these headings sometimes appear in different records. There are two records for Seno  X  , Kappa in CALIS, for example: one for the Japanese authorized heading  X  for the Chinese authorized heading  X   X   X   X   X  , 1930- X . By way of contrast, only one record for Kenzaburo Oe exists in CALIS, and the record has authorized headings: in simplified Chinese script, traditional Chinese script, Hanyu Pinyin , and Japanese.
According to the interview, NCL constructs both Japanese authorized headings for Japanese materials and Chinese autho-rized headings for translated materials by taking character forms from the resources being catalogued and cross-referencing them, using Heading Linking Entry Fields. However, in the case of San X  X o  X  Rai, search results differ between search terms  X   X   X  (in Kanji ) and  X   X   X   X   X  (in traditional Chinese characters). In this case, cross-referencing seems not to have been done. In the HKCAN database, Chinese characters corresponding to authority headings are recorded in Heading Linking Entry
Fields. According to an e-mail response from HKCAN, the types of Chinese characters generally depend on the resources being catalogued. For example, the authorized heading of  X  X itch u Keizai Kyo  X  kai X ,  X  the Heading Linking Entry Field instead of in its traditional Chinese characters, which should be  X  hand, the authorized heading of  X  X o  X  dansha Inta  X  nashonaru Kabushiki Kaisha X ,  X  nese characters are transcribed (i.e. without any change) from the resources being catalogued for See From references ( NLK, 2006 ). This means that several types of Chinese characters might be recorded in reference fields.

LC does not prescribe forms of Chinese characters. Thus, some records do not have references in Kanji even if the autho-number: nr 94028021) has six references in Chinese characters:  X   X   X   X  and  X   X   X   X   X   X   X . However, none of these forms is in the correct Kanji , X  5.2. Relating yomi to their corresponding Kanji entries
As noted already, yomi is highly important for Japanese names in order to distinguish one name from a similar name that uses the same characters but that is pronounced differently. As Table 4 shows, three Japanese organizations construct authority data relating author names to yomi and their corresponding Kanji entries.

Conforming to  X  X ppendix C: Multiscript Records Model A: Vernacular and transliteration X  ( LC, 2008b ) of MARC 21/A, NDL tled $6 ( NDL, 2012b ). The linkage subfield $6 contains a linking field and an occurrence number, so that users can identify which yomi entry is associated with which Kanji entry. When a name is in Kanji , 880 fields are mandatory ( NDL, 2012b ).
NACSIS-CAT separates names in Kanji from their yomi using  X  X | X  in authorized headings and reference fields. According to its manual, yomi is mandatory when the information is applicable or readily available. In the system at Keio, Kanji with yomi are indexed together in order to distinguish between the same characters with different pronunciations. Additionally, Keio prepares extended fields for Japanese data in addition to regular fields. Extended fields repeat regular fields and add a sub-field, $9K, for yomi entries. Subfield $6 contains occurrence numbers to indicate which katakana entry corresponds to which Kanji entry. CALIS adds yomi in parenthesis to designate authorized headings.

In other organizations, yomi is generally not employed. According to an interview, it is recorded by way of reference if the cataloguer judges it necessary in NLK, but the correspondences between the Kanji headings and their yomi are not usually indicated. 5.3. Treatments and types of romanization 5.3.1. Treatments of romanization
As Table 5 shows, NDL and Keio provide romanization in the same manner as yomi . NACSIS-CAT occasionally employs romanization as an optional reference entry; likewise, romanization is not mandatory in CALIS, NCL, or NLK. In many search terms, romanization in NACSIS-CAT also exists in reference entries in CALIS, in that CALIS copies Japanese authority data from NACSIS-CAT. HKCAN, SNUL, and LC employ romanization for authorized headings. 5.3.2. Types of romanization
Except for those that do not adopt romanization, all organizations studied employ the Hepburn system for romanization of Japanese. NDL used to follow the kunrei-shiki system, but since November 2011, it has been using the Hepburn system also. According to an e-mail response in September 2012, SNUL complies with the ALA-LC Romanization Tables: Japanese (hereafter referred to as ALA-LC romanization tables). Since HKCAN complies with AACR2, MARC 21, and LCNAF, it is natural that HKCAN should also use the ALA-LC romanization tables.

The ALA-LC romanization tables were revised in 2012. The new ALA-LC romanization tables set out the rules in more detail but do not attempt to modify the existing rules. Both old and new versions are based on Kenkyusha X  X  New Japanese-English Dictionary and the American National Standard (ANSI Z39.11-1972) ( Kudo, 2011 ).

Table 6 shows differences among five organizations that adopt romanization for authorized headings or mandatory elements.

SNUL has some headings without a macron in the bibliographic data. For example, the entry  X  X   X  e, Kenzaburo  X   X  returned 65 results in OPAC of SNUL, and  X  X e, Kenzaburo X  returned 69 results (search performed January 18, 2013). The four extra results returned in the latter search included three headings with  X  X e, Kenzaburo X  (without a birth year) and one with  X  X  X , Kenzaburo X .

Even the same  X  X   X   X  can be used for two different yomi . One is  X  Ogai Mori, disregarding the use of a macron, five organizations use the same representation,  X  X ori, O  X  gai X . For Kenzaburo yoryo  X  , which NDL has applied since December 2011, the representation should  X  X mit the representation of prolonged sounds or long vowels X ; thus Kenzaburo Oe should be presented as  X  X e, Kenzaburo X . According to an e-mail response from NDL, when re-generating romanization from yomi at the time of data migration, in line with the introduction of the new system in 2012, for names like  X  X enoo, Kappa X  or  X  X amura, Naoomi X  (  X   X   X   X  caused some data to be described outside the Hepburn system. Meanwhile, new data constructed by NDL after 2012 use  X  X  X  for long vowels, resulting in a variety of representations.

According to Ro  X  maji no tsuzurikata , the moraic obstruent (small  X  X su X  in Japanese) before  X  X h X  should be represented by doubled consonants. On the other hand, MOFA Hepburn has a special provision which states that  X  X efore  X  X  X h, X  the moraic obstruent should be described by inserting  X  X  X  X  in the same manner as ALA-LC Romanization tables X . Of the five organizations shown in Table 6 , only NDL reflects the policy of Ro  X  maji no tsuzurikata .

Additionally, ALA-LC romanization tables and Ro  X  maji no tsuzurikata have a rule that, when preceding a vowel or  X  X  X  within  X  X enoo, Kappa X , where the  X  X  X  is syllabic-initial. Neither Keio nor MOFA Hepburn applies the rule.

Moreover, HKCAN, SNUL, and LC romanize  X   X   X   X   X   X  (meaning  X  X  joint-stock corporation X ) as  X  X abushiki kaisha X , applying the rule of ALA-LC romanization tables even though the Japanese pronunciation should be  X  X abushiki gaisha X .
Except for the search terms shown in Table 6 , all organizations describe each romanization in Table 1 in the same way,  X  X  X  is written  X  X  X  rather than  X  X  X . Although MOFA Hepburn applies this rule, the ALA-LC romanization tables and Ro  X  maji no tsuzurikata do not apply it, and all organizations describe  X  or  X  X ai kaku Kanbo  X   X , not  X  X aikaku Kambo X .
 Table 7 summarizes the differences in the Hepburn system between Ro  X  maji no tsuzurikata , NCR 1965 ed., MOFA Hepburn,
ALA-LC romanization tables, and those organizations that adopt romanization in their authority data. Although all of these organizations adopt the Hepburn system, some differences were found. For instance, according to Ro  X  maji no tsuzurikata ,a circumflex accent mark should be used to describe long vowels, whereas no circumflex should be used in MOFA Hepburn.
NDL used the circumflex accent mark until March 2002, but ceased in April 2002. Keio does not use any circumflexes. On the other hand, HKCAN, SNUL, and LC use macrons for long vowels, based on the ALA-LC romanization tables. 5.3.3. Defects in VIAF matching
As Table 7 indicates, NDL romanization is different from that used by LC. It is probable that the difference influences data matching.

To estimate how differences in romanization affect VIAF matching, the following preliminary investigation was con-ducted. First, authorized headings that include the moraic obstruent (small  X  X su X ) before  X  X hi X   X  that is to say,  X   X  were searched December 15, 2012, in Web NDL Authorities using a SPARQL query. The search result set of 702 authority records was extracted. Second, both NDL romanization (many including the letters  X  X c X ) and Hepburn romanization (convert-ing the letters  X  X c X  to  X  X c X ) of these target records were searched on VIAF. The results were examined manually to determine whether the target entities were searched correctly.

Although many entities could be searched using both NDL and Hepburn romanization  X  that is, the search results were the same  X  in 111 cases (about 15.8% of the records), the search results were different and had some defects. These 111 cases did not include the nine names used only as subject headings by NDL. Unmatched data that could not be confirmed as belonging to the same person because of lack of information in the records were omitted from this investigation. Table 8 shows details of the defects.

In Table 8 ,  X  X annot retrieve when using  X  X  X c X  X  means either that no result was returned, or that a wrong entity appeared when Hepburn romanization was used.  X  X uplicates X  means that different records representing the same entity appeared when searched using both NDL romanization and Hepburn romanization. Separate records should be merged.  X  X annot re-trieve See Also records when using  X  X  X c X  X , means that related records (See Also records) appear only when NDL romanization is used.  X  X ismatched X  means that NDL headings are incorrectly matched and that there are other records that should be merged.

The ratio of author names that include  X   X  X  X   X  in their yomi to the total number of NDL authority records is small. However, their romanization, which differs from the Hepburn romanization. Taking into account the authorized headings, including  X   X   X ,  X   X  X  X   X , etc., in their yomi that have letters like  X  X oo X ,  X  X oo X , etc. in their romanization, there must be more romanizations in
NDL that differ from the Hepburn system. It can be presumed that there are a certain number of defects in these records. The result from this investigation indicates that the differences that emerge from romanization may constitute barriers to data matching. 5.4. Representations in local languages outside Japan As Table 9 shows, NLK adopts Hangeul transcripted from Japanese pronunciations for personal authorized headings, and Hangeul transliterated from Chinese characters for references.

SNUL adopts both Hangeul transcripted from Japanese pronunciations and Hangeul transliterated from Chinese characters based on the resources being catalogued for references.

In the CALIS database, Hanyu Pinyin is one of the authorized headings in Chinese authority records. In Japanese authority records, Hanyu Pinyin or other variant forms in such scripts as Hangeul are recorded in reference fields of partial records.
However, most of these references have been copied from NACSIS-CAT, which can be deduced from the fact that such ref-erences also exist in NACSIS-CAT records.

English names and Hanyu Pinyin are sometimes recorded in the reference fields of HKCAN records. When comparing them with LCNAF records, it is found that many references in HKCAN are the same as references in LCNAF. However, HKCAN has added some reference entries of its own accord. For instance, a record for  X  X ai, San X  X o  X   X  has a Reference Entry  X  1832 X  in the HKCAN database, but it does not exist in the LCNAF record. There are many variant forms in non-Latin scripts X  X uch as Hangeul , Cyrillic, and so on X  X n the reference fields of LCNAF records. 5.5. Names in hiragana To investigate how organizations deal with names in hiragana , five personal names (four new names added to  X  X iyabe,
Miyuki X  of Table 1 ) that include hiragana script were searched in the six non-Japanese databases. Table 10 shows the search results. With regard to the two Korean organizations, OPACs were searched instead of the authority databases because the latter are not accessible.

In the Japanese authority records of CALIS, all names are described correctly in Japanese. However, some authors also have Chinese authority records, in which the hiragana parts are converted to Chinese characters. Their representations may be a result of the resources X  being catalogued, such as Japanese books translated into Chinese, in which Japanese author names in hiragana are usually substituted by Chinese characters. The problem is that some Japanese and Chinese authority records are not linked or merged, although the CALIS manual provides for the fact that several authorized headings should be placed together under one authority record. When users search in Japanese, only Japanese authority records appear. In the HKCAN database, Japanese forms that correspond to their authorized headings are generally described correctly in
Heading Linking Entry fields; thus, both Japanese forms and romanization can be used in a search. Only in the record for  X  X ak-ura, Momoko X  are Chinese characters described in the Heading Linking Entry Field. Despite the rule on cross-referencing Jap-anese and Chinese authorized headings, such cross-references could not be confirmed in the OPAC of NCL.
In the OPAC of NLK, the number of search engine hits differs according to search terms. However, results for romanization and Japanese forms were the same except for in Banana Yoshimoto X  X  case in the OPAC of SNUL. Since Japanese forms are described as references in LCNAF records, both romanization and Japanese forms could be searched in LCNAF. 6. Discussion: differences in representations and problems to be solved First, no organization adopts Kanji for authorized headings of Japanese names except Japanese organizations and CALIS.
However, HKCAN, NCL, SNUL, and LC adopt Chinese characters from the resources being catalogued; there are mixed head-ings in Kanji and other Chinese characters in databases, depending on the characters found in the resources. It is natural for
Japanese authors to wish to be indicated in correct Kanji . However, systems or tables which convert variant characters can-not avoid some mistakes because they are not perfect, and using many characters involves many risks in retrieval. Sharing authority data may facilitate the addition or linking of names in correct Kanji , thus potentially solving this problem.
Furthermore, few organizations display correspondences between Kanji and their yomi . Yomi provides more precise pro-nunciations than the romanization of Japanese. For instance, for the same  X  X   X   X , its yomi can either be  X  anese names, the existence of yomi in each authority data would be ideal. Otherwise, both romanization and other data ele-ments, such as birth year, would be necessary for matching. Moreover, correspondences between yomi and Kanji should be shown. The relationships could be shown in authorized headings like those found in records from Keio or CALIS, showing yomi as qualifiers of names. It also could be accomplished using the linkage subfield like NDL. The relationship helps with identification of names because matching algorithms should check the combination of Kanji and yomi, and if either one does not match the candidate, a negative would result.

Although the romanization of Japanese is not a perfect surrogate for yomi , it is still a strong guide to identifying names with the same Kanji . Nevertheless, romanization is not mandatory in NACSIS-CAT, CALIS, NCL, and NLK. Additionally, roman-ization is different among organizations, even though each organization adopts the Hepburn romanization system. For the purpose of sharing authority data, unification or conversion of a romanization system is needed. It is problematic that romanization is not consistent, even in Japan. In addition, some organizations provide romanization without presenting its correspondence to Kanji . This is also a problem in the case of yomi .

As the above investigation using VIAF shows, the Hepburn system of NDL differs from that of other VIAF participants, which could be one of the impediments to data sharing. In the research on VIAF, many records were successfully matched even when romanized forms were different. The existence of other data elements which prompt an algorithm for identifi-cation might be the reason for this. Thus, enriching other data elements is needed when romanization cannot be the chief factor in identification. Because the details of the VIAF matching algorithm are not clarified, the data elements weighted by the algorithm need to be discussed between the VIAF participants and OCLC. However, as FRAD and RDA advocate, record-ing the various attributes of authority data is very important, and doing so would be helpful in terms of any matching algo-rithm because more information helps to achieve more accurate matching results.

It is natural that some organizations adopt representations in their local language or script. However, as the names in hiragana show, there are some cases in which local and Japanese forms are not linked. There is a fear that some entries might escape a search. Adding headings or linkage to the Japanese forms from other databases is needed in such cases. 7. Conclusions
This study revealed that representations of Japanese names differ from organization to organization. In particular, there sible solutions for sharing authority data among CJK countries and LC are as follows: (1) Databases from China and South Korea have mixed headings in Kanji and other Chinese characters. Adding correct (2) Few organizations display correspondences between Kanji and their yomi . The addition of yomi is an ideal solution, (3) Romanization is not mandatory in some organizations, and the rules of romanization differ among organizations. (4) Some organizations adopt representations in their local language, but they are not linked to Japanese forms. To avoid
As noted earlier, the scope of this study is restricted to representations of Japanese name authority data. Representations of Korean and Vietnamese names will be studied in the near future. In addition, elements of authority data in the Chinese character cultural sphere should also be investigated. This study revealed four main issues concerning representations of Jap-anese authors X  name authority data for sharing. The results may also contribute to constructing authority data models for the Chinese character cultural sphere.
