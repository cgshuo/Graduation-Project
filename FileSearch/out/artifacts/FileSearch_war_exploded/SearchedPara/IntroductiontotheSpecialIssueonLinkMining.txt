 An emerging challenge for data mining is the problem of mining richly structured datasets, where the objects are link ed in some way. Man y real-w orld datasets describ e a variet y of entity types link ed via multiple types of relations. These links pro vide additional con text that can be helpful for man y data mining tasks. Yet multi-relational data vio-lates the traditional assumption of indep enden t, iden tically distributed data instances that pro vides the basis for man y statistical mac hine learning algorithms. Therefore, new ap-proac hes are needed that can exploit the dep endencies across the attribute and link structure.
 With link ed data, new challenges emerge in traditional data mining tasks and new inference tasks are introduced. Clas-si cation of data objects, for example, is more complex with link ed data, since the classi cation decisions are now dep en-den t. This leads to the new challenge of collectiv e classi ca-tion, in whic h the classi cation decisions are resolv ed join tly. The introduction of links implies a host of new descriptiv e and predictiv e inference tasks based on the link structure. These range from capturing descriptiv e patterns in the link structure and predicting emerging links to disco very of clus-ters or comm unities based on attributes and link structure. In recen t years, there has been a surge of interest in this area, fueled largely by dev elopmen ts on the Internet. The Internet has pro vided a medium for hundreds of millions of people to connect with others, comm unicate ideas, express value judgemen ts through the organization of those ideas, and engage in commerce. This has led to signi can t inter-est in challenges suc h as mining the web for information retriev al, online social net works for fostering relationships, and transaction patterns for recommending items of poten-tial interest. Rapid adv ances in sensing, computation, and comm unication have spa wned increasing volumes of multi-relational data. In domains suc h as biosurv eillance, law enforcemen t, homeland securit y, and e-commerce, there is a con tinuing need for algorithms that can iden tify notable patterns in real-time transactional and event data. We ex-pect that the demands for algorithms and pro cesses to help understand and mak e predictions based on multi-relational data will only increase. This special issue brings together a range of articles covering a num ber of challenges in link mining. We begin with a sur-in link mining. Rattigan and Jensen prop ose a new link mining task|anomalous link disco very (ALD)|as an al-ternativ e to link prediction. In con trast to predicting the emergence of new links in a dynamic graph, ALD focuses on the iden ti cation of observ ed links that are anomalous. Rattigan and Jensen's adv ocacy for ALD is based on the challenges of performing link prediction in dynamic graphs in whic h most vertex pairs are not link ed. Suc h sparsely link ed graphs complicate learning because of the massiv e skew in the ratio of link ed versus unlink ed vertex pairs. The authors qualitativ ely demonstrate the utilit y of simple link prediction mo dels for the ALD task.
 Sev eral of the pap ers describ e speci c net work structures, suc h as temp oral event net works. The next pap er by Sun et al. investigates the problems of relev ance searc h and anomaly detection in bipartite graphs. Man y link datasets can be describ ed as bipartite graphs, suc h as actor-ev ent net works. This pap er presen ts algorithms that compute relev ance scores for nodes in bipartite graphs. The relev ance score is com-puted by de ning a simple Mark ov transition mo del on this graph. Sun et al. then use these relev ance scores to rank the other nodes, and sho w how to nd anomalous connections between nodes in the same partition.
 An interesting asp ect of some link ed data is the availabilit y of additional seman tic information. Ramakrishnan et al. ad-dress the challenge of iden tifying informativ e paths between two entities in an RDF graph. The general goal is to trans-form a given RDF graph into a weigh ted, undirected graph that allo ws one to leverage algorithms speci cally designed to extract relev ant paths from these graphs. The authors prop ose sev eral heuristics for generating edge weigh ts from the kno wn seman tics asso ciated with the RDF data store. The authors then evaluate the qualit y of various com bina-tions of the prop osed heuristics.
 The next article analyzes existing graph mining approac hes. Ketk ar et al. compare two represen tativ e approac hes for graph-based and logic-based link mining: Sub due and CPro-gol. They de ne two types of concept complexit y|structural and seman tic complexit y|and compare the systems' abili-ties to learn structurally and seman tically complex concepts and to utilize bac kground kno wledge. Through the use of a weak er represen tation, Sub due is able to signi can tly out-perform CProgol when learning structurally complex con-cepts. However, CProgol is more e ectiv e than Sub due at learning seman tically complex concepts and utilizing bac k-ground kno wledge. The authors discuss the represen tational issues that lead to these outcomes and o er though ts on how the strengths of both systems may be leveraged in future link mining systems.
 As link mining capabilities impro ve, there is increasing con-cern about the misapplication of these techniques, leading to unwarran ted violations of priv acy . Sweeney discusses this challenge and prop oses the concept of priv acy-enhanced linking as a means to address these concerns. Since individ-uals are not aware of ongoing link mining activities exam-ining their personal data, the burden is on the technology and ultimately by the technology dev elop er to ensure that link mining algorithms pro vide an appropriate degree of pri-vacy protection. Sweeney argues that algorithm dev elop-ers should routinely assess the priv acy protection o ered by their algorithms and publish those assessmen ts, along with traditional task-sp eci c performance measures.
