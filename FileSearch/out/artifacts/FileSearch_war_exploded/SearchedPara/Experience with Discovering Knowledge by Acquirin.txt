 Machines and people have complementary skills in Knowledge Discovery. Automated techniques can process enormous amounts of data to fi nd new relationships, but generally these are represented by fairly simple models. On the other hand people are endlessly inventive in creating models to explain data at hand, but have problems developing consis tent overall mode ls to explain all the data that might occur in a domain; and the larger the model, the more difficult it becomes to maintain consistency. Ripple-Down Rules is a t echnique that has been developed to allow people to make real-time updates to a model whenever they notice some data that the model does not yet explain, while at the same time maintaining consiste ncy. This allows an entire knowledge base to be built while it is already in use by making updates. There are now 100s of Ripple-Down-Rule knowledge bases in use and this paper presents some observations from log files tracking how people build these systems, and also outlines some recent research on how such techniques can be used to add greater specificity to the simple r models developed by automated techniques. MANAGEMENT: H.2.8 Database appl ications: Subjects: Data mining Paul Compton is an emeritus professor of Computer Science at the University of New South Wales, where he was head of the School of Computer Sc ience and Engineering for 12 years. In the 1980s he was involved in the development of GARVAN-ES1, one of th e first medical expert systems to go into routine clinical use. The maintenance proble ms with this, led to his interest in incremental knowledge acquisition and in particular the deve lopment of Ripple-Down Rules as a way of minimizing the maintenance effort. His research over the last 20 years has focused on extending this incremental approach to a range of diffe rent problems. Ripple-Down Rules have been commercialized by a number of companies with a pplications ranging from interpreting pathology reports (Pacific Knowledge Syst ems) to data cleansing for bi g data applications (IBM).
