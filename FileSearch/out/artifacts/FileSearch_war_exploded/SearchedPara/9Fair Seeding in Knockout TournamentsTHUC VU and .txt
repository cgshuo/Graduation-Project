 THUC VU and YOAV SHOHAM, Stanford University Knockout tournaments constitute a common format of sporting events, which attract millions of viewers and billions of dollars annually, and also model a specific type of election scheme (namely, sequential pairwise elimination election). In this simple and familiar format, the players are placed at the leaf nodes of a binary tree (which is often, but not always, balanced). The players at sibling nodes will compete against each other in pairwise matches and the winners will move up the tree. The winner of the tournament is the player who reaches the root node of the tournament tree. The arrangement of the players at the leaf nodes is called the seeding of the tournament.
The seeding can significantly influence the result of a tournament. This has been demonstrated in several papers, but most of them focus on how to find a seeding that maximizes the winning probability of the strongest player (so-called predictive power) [Appleton 1995; Horen and Riezman 1985; Ryvkin 2005; Vu and Shoham 2010]. This usually means giving the strongest player the easiest schedule, while making it harder for the remaining players. An example of such seedings is given in Figure 1. In this example, players are numbered based on their strengths, with player 1 being the strongest player. This seeding is rarely seen in practice, however, because it seems to be very unfair to other players, especially the strong ones such as 2 or 3.
The most popular seeding actually used in major sport tournaments is the one that pairs up in the first stage the strongest player with the weakest player, the second strongest player with the second weakest player, so on and so forth. An example for 8 players is shown in Figure 2. One possible rationale is that it seems fair: confronta-tions between strong players are delayed until later rounds, and that helps increase the chance that one of those strong players will win the tournament. This raises sev-eral questions: How do we capture this intuition about fairness? Is there any other seeding that is also fair? Can we always find such a fair seeding?
To answer these questions, we consider two alternative fairness criteria adapted from the literature: envy-freeness and order preservation. We analyze separately each criterion across different tournament settings, providing both possibility and impos-sibility results. To explain our results we need to lay out the settings with all their variants, which we do in the next section. In Section 3 we summarize the existing results from the literature. We then analyze envy-freeness and order preservation in Section 4 and 5, respectively, and conclude in Section 6. We consider two different types of tournament structures and two different models of winning probabilities between the players. Regarding the tournament structure, we consider both balanced and unconstrained tournaments (as long as the tournament structure is a binary).

Among the unconstrained tournaments, we want to draw attention to a special structure called  X  X aterpillar X  tree. In a tournament with a caterpillar structure, the players are arranged in some order. The first two players will compete against each other. The winner of the match will then advance forward and compete with the third player, so on and so forth. An example is shown in Figure 3. This structure has been studied in the social choice literature as a voting tree structure and has been shown to have interesting properties [Fischer et al. 2009].

Among balanced tournaments, S  X  n is a seeding formed by matching in the first stage the strongest player with the weakest player, the second strongest player with the second weakest player, and so on and so forth. For the successive rounds, the subtree containing the strongest player is combined with the subtree containing the weakest players possible, so on and so forth.
 Here we encode the seeding by a permutation of the numbers between 1 and n .The k th number is the ranking of the player that will be placed at the k th leaf node of the binary tournament tree, from left to right. An example of S  X  n when n =8is S  X  8 = [1 , 8 , 4 , 5 , 2 , 7 , 3 , 6], as shown in Figure 2.

Most knockout tournaments used in practice are balanced. Although the caterpil-lar tournament approximates some real-world competition structures (for example the world championship organized by the World Boxing Association), the main reason to consider unbalanced tournaments in addition to balanced ones is to highlight the spe-cial properties of the latter.

Regarding the winning probability models, we assume that for any pairwise match, the probability of one player winning against the other is known. This probabil-ity can be obtained from past statistics or from some learning models. In the first model, we do not place any constraints on the probabilities besides the fundamental properties.

Definition 2.1 ( General Winning Probability Model ). Given a set of n players, the winning probabilities between the players form a matrix P such that p ij denotes the the following constraints: (1) p ij + p ji =1 (2) 0  X  p ij , p ji  X  1 p
The second winning probability model is the monotonic model which is a special case of the general model. This model is popular and well known in the literature [Horen and Riezman 1985; Hwang 1982; Moon and Pullman 1970; Schwenk 2000; Vu et al. 2009]. The players are assumed to have unknown but fixed intrinsic strengths or abilities. They are numbered from 1 to n in descending order of their strengths and the winning probabilities between the players reflect these rankings.

Definition 2.2 ( Monotonic Winning Probability Model ). Given a set of n players, the winning probabilities between the players form a matrix P such that p ij denotes the the following constraints: (1) p ij + p ji =1 (2) 0  X  p ij , p ji  X  1 (4) p ji  X  p ( j +1) i (which is actually implied by (1) and (3)) We define a knockout tournament as the following.

Definition 2.3 ( General Knockout Tournament ). Given a set N of players and a win-ning probability matrix P , a knockout tournament KT N =( T , S ) is defined by: (1) A tournament structure T which is a binary tree with | N | leaf nodes (2) A seeding S which is a one-to-one mapping between the players in N and the leaf Note that we will write KT N as KT when the context is clear.
 Given the winning probability matrix P for a set of players N and a tournament is calculated by the following recursive formula. (1) If N = { j } ,then q ( k , KT N )= and symmetrically for k  X  N 2 .

Using the formula above, we can efficiently calculate the winning probabilities of the players in time O ( | N | 2 ). There are two main approaches in tournament design. The first one is qualitative approach: maximizing a specific quantity of the tournament. In Hazon et al. [2007] and Vu et al. [2009], the objective function is maximizing the winning probability of a given target player. In other works [Groh et al. 2009; Horen and Riezman 1985; Ryvkin 2005; Vu and Shoham 2010], the authors assume the players are ordered based on their intrinsic strengths, and the winning probabilities are monotonic with regards to this ordering. The quantities being maximized in these papers include the winning the players.

The second approach is axiomatic. Different properties are proposed for a  X  X ood X  seeding. Most of the work within this approach focuses on balanced knockout tour-naments with the monotonic winning probability model. In Schwenk [2000], three axioms are proposed to specify what a good seeding should satisfy. The axioms are called delayed confrontation, sincerity rewarded, and favoritism minimized.  X  Delayed Confrontation . Two players rated among the top 2 j players shall never meet until the number of players has been reduced to 2 j or fewer.  X  Sincerity Rewarded . A higher-ranked player should never be penalized by being given a schedule more difficult than that of any lower ranked.  X  Favoritism Minimized . The schedule should minimize favoritism to any particular rank.

In order to achieve these axioms, Schwenk [2000] introduces a seeding method in which for n =2 m players, they are divided into m cohorts with cohort C i (1  X  i  X  m ) then be randomly placed at the pre-assigned positions of the cohort. The randomized seeding is shown to satisfy all three axioms on expectation. However, for a chosen seeding after the randomization, it can be grossly unfair.

Alternatively, in Hwang [1982], a different property called monotonicity is used as a requirement for a good seeding.  X  Monotonicity . The probability of a given player winning the tournament is higher than all of the weaker players.
 To achieve this property, the players are reseeded after each round such that the strongest player remained faces the weakest, the second-strongest faces the second-weakest, so on and so forth.

We will generalize sincerity rewarded and monotonicity so that they can also be applied for the general winning probability model. Unlike past work which uses prob-abilistic seedings [Schwenk 2000] or dynamic seedings [Hwang 1982], we focus on deterministic and static seedings instead, since they are more often used in practice. Interestingly, in Horen and Riezman [1985] and Groh et al. [2009] it is shown that for a balanced tournament of size 4 with monotonic winning probability model, the seed-ing[1423]alwaysachieves X  X onotonicity. X  Tournamentofsize4isaspecialcase due to its extremely small size. For our paper, we focus on tournaments of sizes 8 or larger.

Other tournament formats such as round robin or Swiss-system are also addressed in the literature (see Kendall et al. [2010] for an extensive survey). Most of the work here focuses on graph-theoretic and combinatorial properties of the tournament (e.g., no team plays on the same court two consecutive rounds, or no team plays against extremely weak or extremely strong teams in consecutive rounds) as opposed to the winning probabilities of the players. In Schwenk [2000], it is argued that a good seeding should not give any strong player a harder tournament schedule than a weaker player. One of the main reasons is that if strong players are given harder schedules, they will have incentives to under-perform during the preseason period or lie about their strengths in order to get lower rankings instead. We formalize this intuition to define envy-freeness as the first criterion for a seeding to be fair: no player envies the seeding position of another player weaker than him.

First we need to specify when a player is considered to be stronger than another. In the monotonic winning probability model, the notion of a stronger player is clear. For the general model, that is no longer the case. Player i might be stronger than j while playing against some opponents but not the others. Similarly, the winning probability between i and j by itself is not a good indicator either. Player i may have much higher chancetowininthematchagainst j , but has much lower chance than j while playing against other players. In this case, it is unclear which player should be considered stronger.

To avoid these disputable cases, we define a player to be stronger between the two if he dominates the second player when playing against all other players.
Definition 4.1 ( Dominance ). Player i dominates another player j if and only if the p This definition is natural and intuitive. Notice that it also applies to the monotonic model; here domination is equivalent to being higher ranked.

When there is a tie between two players (i.e., all of their winning probabilities are equal), we need a tie-breaking rule. Our results hold for any monotonic tie-breaking rule. WLOG, we assume the tie is resolved based on lexicographic ordering: for any considered to dominate j if and only if i &lt; j .
 Given the definition of Dominance, we define Envy-freeness as the following.
Definition 4.2 ( Envy-Free Seeding ). Given a set N of players, a winning probability matrix P , and a knockout tournament KT N =( T , S ), the seeding S is envy-free if and of winning the tournament by swapping his position in the seeding S with j  X  X , i.e., q ( i , ( T , S ))  X  q ( i , ( T , S = S Notice that in the general winning probability model, if there is no pair of players such that one dominates the other, any seeding will trivially satisfy the requirement above. On the other extreme, in the monotonic model, an envy-free seeding will have to satisfy the requirement for all pairs of players. When there is no constraint on the structure of the tournament, envy-freeness can be achieved by the following tournament structure and seeding method. Note that the result holds for the general model (and hence the monotonic model also).
T HEOREM 4.3. Given a set N of players, a winning probability matrix P, envy-freeness can be achieved by the knockout tournament with the caterpillar structure and below i on the tournament tree.

The seeding above can be achieved easily by first constructing a directed acyclic graph in which each node represents a player and there is a directed edge from player of the graph and use this ordering to place players on the tournament tree. We are then guaranteed that dominated players are placed lower on the tournament tree and the above condition is satisfied.

P ROOF OF T HEOREM 4.3. We prove the theorem by induction on the number of players.

Base case. When | N | = 2, there is only one possible binary tree with 2 leaf nodes which is trivially envy-free.

Inductive case. Assume that the theorem holds for all N such that | N | = n  X  1, we need to show for all N such that | N | = n , the seeding we construct as above is envy-free.
 i dominates j then j is placed below i on the tournament tree. Let k  X  be the player at the root node of the tournament tree using the seeding S .Let N = N \{ k  X  } . Due to the special property of S , there is no player k  X  N such that k dominates k  X  .
Since N has size n  X  1, based on the inductive hypothesis, the seeding S for N (as shown in Figure 4) is envy-free. Thus to show that S is also envy-free, we just need to show that k  X  is not envious of any player placed below him. In other words, k  X  will not have a higher winning probability when swapping his seeding position with any player k i  X  N .

Using the same notation as in Section 2, we denote S as: Let S i be the seeding created from S by swapping k  X  with k i : j  X  i , the winning probability of k  X  will stay the same.
 play against k  X  (in other words, the probability that k j will win the sub-tournament because:
Let us consider the winning probability of k  X  in S i  X  1 , which is created by swapping k  X  and k The first inequality holds because p k 0  X  p the player right in front of k  X  in the seeding, the winning probability of k  X  does not decrease. Thus if we keep swapping the position of k  X  with k j in S j sequentially for j =( i  X  1)  X  1, we have the following sequence of inequalities: This shows that k  X  will not have a higher winning probability by swapping its seeding position with player k i . Thus S is envy-free. When the tournament structure has to be a balanced binary tree, it is no longer pos-sible to always achieve envy-freeness even when the winning probabilities between players are monotonic. Here we assume n , the number of players, is a power of 2.
T HEOREM 4.4. For any n =2 r  X  8 , there exists a set of n players with a monotonic winning probability matrix P such that it is not possible to find an envy-free seeding S for the balanced knockout tournament between these n players.
 P ROOF . Wefirstprovetheresultforthecasewhen n = 8, and then for general n .
Thecaseofn = 8. We construct a tournament between 8 players with the winning probability matrix as shown in Table I (note that we show only the top half of the matrix).

Since there are only 315 unique seedings for a tournament of 8 players, we can exhaustively check all of them using a computer program. Given this winning prob-ability matrix, for each of those 315 seedings, there is always a pair of players whose probabilities of winning the tournament violate the criterion.

The case of n =2 r &gt; 8. To construct a tournament between n players, we add ( n  X  8) dummy players to the given set of 8 players. The dummy players lose to the original 8 players with probability 1. Note that player 7 and 8 can be regarded as the dummy players to the top 6 players since player 7 and 8 lose with probability 1 to these players. Let M denote the set of the top 6 players from 1 to 6. Essentially the tournament between n players is reduced to a tournament between the players in M as if we take out all of the dummy players and player 7 and 8.

Let us consider all possible tournament trees T M for 6 players. We first prove the following property of T M : For any seeding to be envy-free, in the reduced tournament difference between their depths is greater than 1, as in Figure 5.

This is true since we can always swap j with the dummy player who plays against i in the original tournament and improve the winning probability of j . To show this, let us first calculate the winning probability of j before the swap: Recall that q ( k , A ) is the probability that player k will win the sub-tournament A . After the swap, the winning probability of j becomes: for j , l ,and k in the top 6 players, p jl and p jk is less than 1. Note that we do not assume any relationship between i and j here since our focus is on j being envious of the dummy player who got matched up with i in the original tournament.
 There are only 6 possible knockout tournament trees for 6 players, as shown in Figure 6. However, only the top two trees satisfy the condition that there is no pair of players with a difference in their depths greater than 1. Thus if the seeding of the original tournament is envy-free, the reduced tournament tree T M hastobeoneofthe top two trees.

For each of these trees, notice that the two players who are placed at a smaller depth than the rest must have played against dummy players in the original tournament before they can advance to their current round. Notice that with the current winning probability matrix, player 7 and 8 play the same role as the dummy players. Thus if there existed an envy-free seeding for the original tournament, we would be able to find an envy-free seeding for the set of the top 8 players. However, we have shown in the first part that there does not exist such a seeding. This implies there is no envy-free seeding for the tournament of size n &gt; 8either.

Note that the same result does not apply for unconstrained tournaments. In the previous proof, we make use of the fact that any player must play against some player (which can be a dummy player) to advance to the next round. In the case of unconstrained tournament, a player can advance directly to the final round without competing.

Since the monotonic model is a special case of the general model, we have the fol-lowing corollary.

C OROLLARY 4.5. For any given n =2 r  X  8 , with the general winning probability model, it is not always possible to find an envy-free seeding for a balanced knockout tournament of size n.

Given this impossibility result for balanced tournaments, in the next section we dis-cuss an alternative fairness criterion that seems intuitively weaker weaker condition, with the hope that it can be more easily satisfied. Instead of focusing on the seeding positions of the players, we place a requirement on their probabilities of winning the tournament instead: stronger players must have higher probabilities of winning the tournament than weaker players. This require-ment seems to be less restrictive than the envy-freeness criterion, yet it still encour-ages the players to perform acco rdingly to their strengths.

Definition 5.1 ( Order-Preserving Seeding ). Given a set N of players, a winning prob-ability matrix P , and a knockout tournament KT N =( T , S ), the seeding S is order pre-
The criterion is adapted and generalized from the notion of Monotonicity first intro-duced in Hwang [1982]. When there is no constraint on the structure of the tournament, it is easy to see that the same tournament structure and seeding in Theorem 4.3 will achieve order preservation.

T HEOREM 5.2. Given a set N of players, a winning probability matrix P, order preservation can be achieved by the knockout tournament with the caterpillar struc-placed below i on the tournament tree.
 P ROOF . Recall from Theorem 4.3 that the seeding S created as above is envy-free. Using proof by contradiction, we assume S is not order preserving, and show that this implies it will not be envy-free either.

If S is not order preserving, there must exist two player i ,and j such that i dominates dominates j , i must be placed above j on the tournament tree. Let A be the set of players placed above i on the tournament tree, B between i and j ,and C below j .The winning probabilities of j given the seeding S can be calculated as the following: Here we use q ( k , C ) to denote the probability that player k  X  C will win the sub-tournament between the players in C and advance to the match against player j .
Let S be the seeding created by swapping the position of i and j in S .Since S is envy-free, the winning probability of i with the seeding S must not be smaller than the following: However, since i dominates j ,  X  k  X  N , p ik  X  p jk and p ij  X  p ji . Therefore we have: This is a contradiction. Thus S must be also order-preserving.

Notice that the method above does not take into consideration the actual values of the winning probabilities between players. The criterion can be achieved as long as the relative ordering of the players are known. It would be very useful if the same result applied for the case of balanced tournament. Unfortunately, as we show in the next section, no fixed seeding is always order preserving for balanced tournaments, even when the winning probabilities are monotonic.
 If the seeding S  X  n as in Figure 2 could be shown to always satisfy order preservation, this would justify its popularity in practice. However, as we show in the following theorem, there are cases in which this seeding violates the criterion.

T HEOREM 5.3. For any fixed seeding S of a balanced tournament of size n =2 r  X  8 , there exists a monotonic winning probability matrix P such that S is not order preserving.

P ROOF . We first show by induction that if there exists a fixed seeding S that always satisfies order preservation, then S has to be S  X  n (as defined in Section 2). Base case. When n =2, S  X  2 = [1 2] is the only seeding.

Inductive case. Assume that the claim holds for n = m , we need to show that it also holds for n =2 m . We will present a sequence of winning probability matrices that all impose different constraints on an order preserving seeding. Since we are looking for a fixed seeding that is order preserving for any given winning probabilities, any seeding that does not satisfy all of these constraints can be discarded.

Let X  X  first consider the following winning probabilities between the players:  X   X  i , j :1  X  i , j &lt; 2 m , p  X   X  i :1  X  i &lt; 2 m , p Note that due to monotonic tie-breaking rule, player 1 dominates all other players here. The only order preserving seedings in this case are the ones that pair up player 1and2 m in the first round. Otherwise whoever gets to play against player 2 m will we can now only consider the seedings that match up player 1 and 2 m in the first round.

Let us consider another set winning probabilities between the players:  X   X  i , j :1  X  i , j &lt; 2 m  X  1, p  X   X  i :1  X  i &lt; 2 m  X  1, p Since we already know that the remaining seedings under consideration must match up player 1 with player 2 m , player 2 must then be matched up with player 2 m  X  1to satisfy order preservation.

We can take this argument and generalize it to show for each value of k =3  X  m , player k hastobematchedupwithplayer(2 m  X  k + 1) by using the following set of winning probabilities:  X   X  i , j :1  X  i , j  X  2 m  X  k , p  X   X  i , j :1  X  i  X  2 m  X  k , 2 m  X  k +1  X  j  X  2 m , p  X   X  i , j :2 m  X  k +1  X  i , j  X  2 m , p against the bottom k players. The bottom k players also tie among themselves. In this case, since the top k  X  1 players are already matched up with the bottom k  X  1players, player k has to be matched up with player (2 m  X  k +1) in order to have a higher winning probability than the players from ( k +1)to(2 m  X  k ).

Now let us consider the case in which the top m players win against the bottom m players with probability 1. We have shown that player k ,  X  k :1  X  k  X  m ,hasto be paired up with player (2 m  X  k + 1). Therefore, all the top m players will advance to the next round with probability 1. The current tournament essentially becomes a tournament between these m players. Based on the inductive hypothesis, they must be seeded by S  X  m . This proves that the seeding for 2 m players must be S  X  2 m .
In the preceding, we have used induction to show that the fixed seeding that satisfies winning probability matrix such that S  X  n violates the criterion. Consider the following winning probabilities.  X   X  i , j :1  X  i &lt; 6 &lt; j  X  n , p  X   X  i :9  X  i  X  n , p  X   X  i , j :1  X  i , j  X  5, p  X  p 36 = p 46 = p 56 =0 . 5, and p 16 = p 26 =1.  X  All other winning probabilities are 0.5.
 In other words, the top 8 players win against all other players with probability 1. The top 5 players tie with each other and win against player 7, and 8 with probability 1. Player 6 loses to 1 and 2 with probability 1 but ties with player 3, 4, and 5.
Let X  X  consider the last 3 rounds of the tournament. Only the top 8 players make player 3 has only 50% chance of winning against player 6, player 2 has more chance of getting into the final match than player 1. If we carry out the calculations, we have always order preserving either.

Since the monotonic model is a special case of the general model, we have the fol-lowing corollary.

C OROLLARY 5.4. For any given n =2 r  X  8 , there is no fixed seeding S that is al-ways order preserving for any balanced tournaments of size n with the general winning probability model.

The results above do not preclude the existence of a fair seeding for any given set of players and winning probabilities. While such existence remains an important open problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm to find an order preserving seeding and show through experiments that the algorithm is indeed efficient and effective. The pseudocode is provided in Algorithm 1.

The recursive algorithm attempts to find a fair seeding for each half of the initial seeding. It then checks to see if there are any pairs of players that violate the order preserving condition. If there are, it will pick the pair with the maximum difference in ranking (on the dominance graph) between the players and swap the seeding positions of those players. It will then repeat the whole process.

To test the algorithm, we generate 100k test cases of monotonic winning probability model for each of the values of n between 8 and 256. For each test case, we randomly generate the winning probability matrix for n players and then use the algorithm to initial seeding input.

It is not trivial to generate the monotonic winning probability matrix since we need to make sure the matrix satisfies the monoto nicity while ensuring certain randomness. The process is composed of the following steps. (1) Generate the winning probabilities of player 1 by sampling ( n  X  1) values uniformly (2) Assign p ii =0 . 5  X  i .

We show in Figure 7 a graph of the average and maximum number of swaps that are made before a fair seeding is found. The graph shows that both quantities grow linearly with n . And even in the case of n = 256 players, the maximum number of swaps needed is still very small.

Based on the empirical success of the a lgorithm, we conjecture that order-preservation is always achievable. However, the criterion becomes provably impossible to achieve when a relatively weak condition is added. We discuss this additional con-dition and how it interacts with the order preservation criterion in the next section. The experimental results of the heuristic algorithm in the previous section suggest that perhaps it is easy and always possible to find an order preserving seeding given the winning probability matrix. However, this optimism is quite fragile. For example, in this section we show that when we add a reasonable requirement of robustness against dropout, the criterion becomes provably impossible to achieve in certain cases.
A dropout occurs when a player forfeits his participation in a tournament due to exogenous factors such as injuries or illness, or in order to manipulate the outcome of the tournament. This phenomenon can significantly influence the winning probabili-ties of the remaining players. We define robustness against dropout as the following: i loses in winning probability after some player drops out. We allow the re-seeding of the remaining players after a dropout and if the tournament has to be balanced, a dummy player will be added.

Definition 5.5 ( Robustness against Dropout ). Given a set N of players, a winning probability matrix P , and a knockout tournament KT =( T , S ). The seeding S is robust against dropout if for any dropout of player k  X  N , there exists a seeding S for the q ( i , ( T , S ))  X  0then q ( j , ( T , S ))  X  q ( j , ( T , S ))  X  0.

It is easy to show that given a winning probability matrix, the robustness require-ment is achievable for both balanced and unconstrained tournaments (e.g., the tourna-ment shown in Figure 8). Indeed the condition is quite weak when used alone. There are other stronger conditions that can be used. For example, no weak player gains in winning probability more than the players stronger than him (this in fact implies the requirement we proposed). However, when coupled with the order preservation requirement, this weak requirement is already enough to make it no longer always possible to find a seeding that can satisfy simultaneously both (even when the win-ning probabilities are monotonic).

T HEOREM 5.6. For any n =2 r  X  8 , there exists a set of n players with a mono-tonic winning probability matrix P such that it is not possible to find a seeding S such that Ssatisfies simultaneously the order p reservation requirement and the condition for robustness against dropout.
 P ROOF . For a given n , we show how to construct the winning probability matrix P . There will be 3 top players and n  X  3 dummy players. The winning probabilities players will lose against the top 3 players with probability 1. Thus the tournament is reduced to a tournament between these 3 players. There are only three possible The last seeding does not satisfy the condition of robustness: when player 3 drops out, the winning probability of player 2 increases from 0.25 to 0.5, whereas the winning probability of player 1 decreases from 0.55 to 0.5. Note that this proof works for both balanced and unbalanced tournament. Fairness in tournament designs is an important consideration and to date the litera-ture on tournament designs has not adequately addressed it. We introduced two alter-native fairness criteria: envy-freeness and order preservation. We showed that when there is no constraint on the structure of the tournament, fairness can be achieved easily for both criteria. For balanced tournaments, we provided two impossibility re-sults: one for any seeding under the first criterion, and the other for any fixed seeding under the second criterion. When the seeding can vary depending on the actual values of the winning probabilities, we proposed a heuristic algorithm to find a seeding that satisfies order preservation. We showed that the algorithm is efficient and effective through experiments.

However, our hope of being able to find a fair seeding in all cases was dimmed by the fact that when we included a requirement of robustness, the criterion became provably impossible to satisfy for all cases. This suggests one should try to find the conditions of the winning probabilities between players that will guarantee the existence of a fair seeding. This remains an interesting open problem.
