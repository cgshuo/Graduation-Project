 The Healthy Waterways Partnership (The Partnership) framework illustrates a unique integrated approach to water quality ma nagement whereby scientific research, community participation, and policy/strategy development are done in parallel with each other. This collaborative effort has resulted in a water quality management strategy, which integrates the socio-economic and ecological values of the waterways, and has led to significant cost savings by providing a clear focus on initiatives towards achieving the healthy waterways:healthy catchments vision which is By 2020, our waterways and catchments will be healthy ecosystems supporting the livelihoods and lifestyles of people in South East Queensland, and will be managed through collaboration between community, government and industry. 
The Partnership represents a whole-of-government, whole-of-community approach to understanding, planning for, and managing the use of our waterways. The key elements of the Partnership include: the implementation by a range of partners of management actions ranging from upgrades in sewage treatment plants, to improved planning regimes and rehabilitation of riparian vegetation; a multi-disciplinary science and research program that underpins the management action program and monitors its effectiveness; and the Healthy Waterways promotional and educational community awareness and support for action. 
The Adaptive Management Framework (Figure 1), one of the operating philosophies of the Partnership, can be described as ongoing knowledge acquisition, monitoring and evaluation leading to continuous improvement in the identification and implementation of management. The a pproach recognises that action can seldom be postponed until we have  X  X nough X  information to fully understand the situation. This leads to improved understanding of the means for dealing with resource management issues, as well as providing the flexibility necessary for dealing with changing socio-economic or socio-ecological relationships. 1.1 Balanced Approach The natural checks and balances provided by the tripartite model of management, research and monitoring (Figure 2) provide the foundation for the Partnership. The interactions between management, research and monitoring involves a two-way flow of information. Management, with input from the community, provides environmental values and resource management objectives, identifies key environmental issues and knowledge gaps. Researchers addresses the ke y issues, gather information to narrow the knowledge gaps and provide the scientific linkages that support and create the various indicators used by resource managers involved in monitoring. Monitoring provides feedback to researchers in the form of prioritised research based on patterns observed during the assessment of the ecosystem. The interactions between monitoring and management are somewhat similar to the management-research interactions. In both cases, management, with input from the community, provides the environmental values and resource management objectives. The major difference is that monitoring provides management with the feedback on various management actions invoked. 
The achievement of the outcomes of the Partnership relies on people from various sectors of society working together. It is proposed here that the central driving force for the developing an effective program or Study is not the absolute amount of scientific or management activity or expertise; rather it is the balance between management, research and monitoring. South East Queensland (Figure 3) has one of the fastest growing populations in Australia, with just over 2 million people, increasing by 2.9% per annum. These increases in population are expected to result in 75 km2 of bushland, agricultural land and other rural land being converted annually to housing and other urban purposes. Initial scenario runs using the Partnership X  X  decision support tools have enabled us to understand the potential impacts in 20 years X  time from the predicted population growth. Thus, the human footprint on the catchment is rather extensive today and promises to be more extensive in the future. 
The riverine and estuarine environments of the South East Queensland catchment have been significantly altered. Land use changes and vegetation clearing have resulted in increased flows, erosion and delivery of both nutrients and sediments from the catchments to the waterways. Only 26% of the catchment X  X  original vegetation remains. Channel (gully and streambank) erosion is the dominant form of erosion in the SEQ Catchment. Most of the sediment is generated from quite specific locations, with more than 60% of the sediment coming from less than 30% of the area. Given the episodic nature of rainfall in the catchme nt, protection of riparian areas, especially catchment and waterways for extreme flow events. During smaller events or dry conditions, urban areas may have a significant contribution of sediment loads to our waterways. 
As a case study in South East Queensland, Australia, an interdisciplinary study of waterways, was initiated by the Partnership to address water quality issues which link sewage and diffuse loading with environmental degradation of Moreton Bay, an Australian estuary, and its waterways. Moreton Bay (153 o E; 27 o S) is a shallow, subtropical embayment with abundant seagrasses, mangroves, sea turtles, and dugong, adjacent to a rapidly expanding population. Like many Australian estuaries, Moreton hyperautotrophic and oligotrophic waters within tens of kilometres. High sediment loads, especially during high flow events, together with resuspension of fine-grained sediments in the river estuaries and western Moreton Bay lead to high turbidity, reduced light penetration and subsequent seagrass loss. Sewage-derived nutrient enrichment, particularly nitrogen (N), has been linked to algal blooms. (Dennison and Abal, 1999). The challenge protecting, maintaining and improving the ecosystem health of South East Queensland X  X  waterways, in the face of increasing population growth in the region, can be met by a quantitative and defensible approach such as that which is being referred to as the  X  X ustainable loads X  concept. The ecosystem health condition of our waterways is an aggregate of the impacts of point (industrial emissions and wastewater treatment plants) and diffuse so urce (urban stormwater, agricultural run-off and natural systems run-off) emissions from the catchments and the assimilative capacity (freshwater and tidal flushing and internal processing) of our waterways. The management is very explicit in the development of water quality improvement plans and regional natural resource management plans. 
The concept of  X  X ustainable loads X  is defined as the amounts of pollutants (e.g. nutrients and sediments) that a waterway can assimilate without becoming degraded. For operational purposes, sustainable loads are loads that a waterway can take and still achieve the water quality objectives which relate to the environmental values set for the waterway (taking into consideration flow into and assimilative capacity of the waterway). Determination of relevant and achievable water quality objectives, reflecting the environmental values and uses which the community attribute to our waterways, is important in the  X  X ustainable loads X  concept. This involves an iterative process where suites of environmental values, management goals, and water quality objectives are evaluated in terms of their acceptability/feasibility (using decision support tools), and compared with alternative suites of feasible values, goals and objectives, if required. 
The strength of the  X  X ustainable loads X  concept is the determination of explicit links between pollutant loads from the catchment (which are a reflection of the activities and pressures in the catchment) to the ecosystem health of our waterways With today X  X  increasing emphasis on integrated water resources management, there is a strong need to deliver to resource managers enhanced capacity to make decisions on appropriate management actions. The adaptive management approach is based on the recognition that we often need to act on the basis of an imperfect understanding of the systems within which management action occurs. However, unless there is active research to expand the knowledge base for management as well as appropriate decision support tools for stakeholders, the outcomes of the adaptive management process will improve only slowly, if at all. Thus, the Partnership is firmly committed to continually improving the knowledge base and the development of decision support tools to assist stakeholders the achievement of natural resource management outcomes. 
Consequently there has been a realisation that there is a definitive need for modelling tools (Figure 4), supported by locally-specific scientific understanding, to enable the  X  X onversion X  of catchment-derived (point and diffuse) loads into resultant (ambient) levels of water quality, which can then be compared with water quality objectives. This provides an important direct or causative link between catchment loads and associated waterway ecosystem health, underpinning the sustainable loads concept. 
This causative link has been pioneered in the region by the Partnership and its stakeholders and has led to the development of a range of stand-alone catchment and receiving water quality models, which have then been linked as determine sustainable loads for the different waterways. The catchment models are largely based on the Environmental Management Support System (EMSS), a software tool specifically developed to meet the requirements of the Partnership. In the case of receiving water quality modelling, a range of models has been developed and used, depending on the needs and specific nature of waterway being studied. The main computational  X  X ool X  used in this regard is the Receiving Water Quality Model (RWQM), a 2-D (plan view) model which covers Moreton Bay and all major estuaries in the region. Other tools ranging from 0-D through to full 3-D parameterisations have also been applied (McAlister, 2005). 
Decision support tools such as the Environmental Management Support System (EMSS) and the Receiving Water Quality Models, are useful not only in evaluating the relative efficacy of various management actions aimed at the improvement of water quality, but can also assist stakeholders in determining sustainable loads and setting environmental targets for waterways. Development of a user-friendly interface to decision support tools also ensures that research outcomes are extended to end-users and stakeholders in the most effective and relevant form. The Partnership framework illustrates a unique integrated approach to water quality management whereby improved understanding and availability of appropriate decision support tools for management of land and water resources result in effective prioritisation of initiatives targeted towards achieving the Healthy Catchments:Waterways vision. One of the hallmarks of the Partnership has been the development of a comprehensive and defensible ecosystem health monitoring program (EHMP) to provide an objective assessment of the health of waterways throughout southeast Queensland. The information collected in the EHMP is used to advise councils and land managers on areas of declining health, report on the effects of different land uses, and to evaluate the effectiveness of management actions aimed at improving and protecting aquatic ecosystems. 
The estuarine and marine EHMP began in 2000 and includes monthly monitoring at 260 sites in coastal waterways from Noosa to the New South Wales border. The freshwater EHMP commenced in 2002 and now involves twice-yearly sampling at over 120 sites on all of the major streams in the region. Both programs use a broad range of biological, chemical and physical indicators  X  chosen because they provide essential information about the status of valuable waterway assets. Monitoring alone, of course, is useful only for documenting declines. 
A key component of the EHMP is the effective communication of monitoring activities and scientific results. One of the major outputs from the Program is the Annual Report Card, which provides a timely reminder to local and State Governments and the broader community as to how well we are tracking in terms of protecting the health of our waterways. This Report Card is underpinned by a comprehensive Annual Technical Report and up-to-date, interpreted water quality and biological information is readily available for use by council and industry partners, managers and scientists and the broader community (see www.ehmp.org). 
The Partnership X  X  Healthy Waterways Campaign provides an essential portal to communicating the understanding of environmental issues to the stakeholders. Healthy Waterways currently enjoys around 50%  X  X rand X  recognition in the South East Queensland Regional Community. South East Queensland (SEQ) is the most sought after place to live in Australia. According to the South East Queensland Regional Plan (Mackenroth, 2005), in the next twenty years, this wonderful region will grow by another one million people. While this massive population growth will drive significant changes in SEQ, for water, the issues will focus around adequacy of good supply and the significant demands urban growth will place on water allocation, water quality and waterways quality. Water supply, water quality, waste water treatment, urban use and reuse and healthy waterways are inextricably linked, and the strategic planning for these needs well as achieving good ecosystem health in our waterways are all essential for urban growth. Hence planning for water needs to be done in a whole of systems context, embracing the SEQ region overall and embodying natural resource management in the broadest sense and not just water resources in isolation. . In addition, experience shows that such planning and management must be adaptive as our understanding of the region X  X  natural systems, the impacts of global changes and our own interactions through planning and management interventions grows. 
Inherent in the Healthy Waterways Partnership model is demonstrable proof that we can take a regional approach and have singular success. Guided by sound scientific and planning advice we have been able to improve the standard of wastewater discharged to our waterways. About 80% of the nitrogen and 60% of the phosphorus now is removed from the wastewater with consequent improvements in water quality for Moreton Bay and other waterways. From a healthy waterways perspective, the next major challenge is to effectively address the pollutant loads coming from non-point (diffuse) sources, if environmental targets are to be met. The Partnership Secretariat estimates that within three years, diffuse pollution sources will and up to 90% of the sediments coming from our catchments into our waterways. Clearly this remains a priority, but it is equall y as clear that this issue now needs to be addressed in concert with a wider set of issues relating to sustainable water futures for urban and rural growth. 
There is already a strong focus within SEQ to deliver through a  X  X hole of water cycle X  philosophy that gives a strong weighting to water quality planning and management. Key regional planning initiatives have been established in anticipation of the rapid population growth expected within SEQ over the next 20 odd years. What is not clear is how each of these initiatives will knit together to ensure a strong framework for the management of water as a potentially limiting resource, in ensuring security of supply for all sectors and the environmental outcomes we are also seeking for our catchments and our waterways. The oppor tunity that faces us is the application of the Partnership model to a wider set of regional needs in terms of water resources, not just for healthy waterways , but for water quality generally, and possibly for greater yields as well. In the past we have used the Partnership to deliver on key aspects of our goal for sustainable, healthy waterways. The opportunity and the challenge that faces us now is how to best evolve the Partnership model, with its strong  X  X rand X  presence to help deliver on our future needs for water and waterways health. The authors would like to acknowledge the stakeholders of the Moreton Bay Waterways and Catchments Partnership, including the 19 local governments, 6 state agencies and 30 major industry and environmental groups in the SEQ region.
