 Communication and inference are intimately linked. Suppos e, for example, that Joan states that some of her pets are dogs. Under normal circumstances, a hear er will infer that not all of Joan X  X  pets are dogs on the grounds that Joan would have expressed he rself differently if all of her pets were dogs [1]. Inferences like these have been widely studie d by linguists and psychologists [2, 3, 4, 5] and are often encountered in everyday settings. One c ompelling explanation is presented by Levinson [4], who points out that speaking (i.e. phonetic articulation) is substantially slower than thinking (i.e. inference). As a result, communication will be maximally efficient if a speaker X  X  the responsibility of the hearer. For communication to be ma ximally efficient, a speaker must take the hearer X  X  perspective into account ( X  X f I say X, will she i nfer Y? X ). The hearer should therefore allow for inferences on the part of the speaker ( X  X id she thin k that saying X would lead me to infer Y? X ) Considerations of this sort rapidly lead to a game-theo retic regress, and achieving efficient communication under these circumstances begins to look lik e a very challenging problem. Here we study a simple communication game that allows us to ex plore inferences made by speakers and hearers. Inference becomes especially important in set tings where speakers are prevented from directly expressing the concepts they have in mind, and wher e utterances are constrained to be short. The television show Password is organized around a game that satisfies both constraints. I n this game, a speaker is supplied with a single, secret word (the pa ssword) and must communicate this word to a hearer by choosing a single one-word clue. For examp le, if the password is  X  X end X , then the speaker might choose  X  X ew X  as the clue, and the hearer mig ht guess  X  X titch X  in response. Figure 1 shows several examples drawn from the show X  X ote that commun ication is successful in the first Figure 1: Three rounds from the television game show Passwor d. Given each password, the top row plots the forward ( S potential clues. The clue chosen by the speaker is circled. G iven this clue, the bottom row plots the forward ( H guesses.

The gra y dots in each plot show words that are associated with the password (top row) or clue (bottom row) i n the University of Southern Florida word association database. Labels for these words are inclu ded where space permits. example but not in the remaining two. The clues and guesses ge nerated by speakers and hearers are obviously much simpler than most real-world linguistic utterances, but studying a setting this simple allows us to develop and evaluate formal models of com munication. Our analyses therefore contribute to a growing body of work that uses formal methods to explore the efficiency of human communication [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
 At first sight the optimal strategies for speaker and hearer m ay seem obvious: the speaker should generate the clue that is associated most strongly with the p assword, and the hearer should guess the word that is associated most strongly with the clue. Note , however, that word associations are asymmetric. Given a pair of words such as  X  X hovel X  and  X  X now X  , the forward association (shovel  X  snow) may be strong but the backward association (shovel  X  snow) may be weak. The third example in Figure 1 shows a case where communication fails because th e speaker chooses a clue with a strong forward association but a weak backward association . Although the data include examples by exploring whether speakers and hearers tend to take backw ard associations into account when generating their clues and guesses.
 Our second hypothesis is that speaker and hearer are calibrated : in other words, that both make accurate assumptions about the strategy used by the other. T aking the other person X  X  perspective into account is a good start, but is no guarantee of calibration. S uppose, for example, that the speaker attempts to make the hearer X  X  task as easy as possible, and co nsiders only backward associations when choosing his clue. This strategy will work best if the he arer considers only forward associates of the clue, but suppose that the hearer considers only backw ard associations, on the theory that the speaker probably generated his clue by choosing a forward as sociate. In this case, both parties are considerate but not calibrated, and communication is unlik ely to prove successful. strategies that tend to share the cognitive burden of commun ication. In operationalizing this hypoth-esis we assume that forward associates are easier for people to generate than backward associates. A pair of strategies can be calibrated but not cooperative: f or example, the speaker and hearer will consider only backward associates. This policy, however, i s likely to demand more effort from the hearer than the speaker, and we propose that speakers and hea rers will satisfy the principle of least collaborative effort [17, 18] by choosing a calibrated pair of strategies where each person weights forward and backward associates equally.
 To evaluate our hypotheses we use word association data to an alyze the choices made by game show contestants. We first present evidence that speakers an d hearers are considerate and take both forward and backward associations into account. We then dev elop simple models of the speaker and hearer, and use these models to explore the extent to which sp eakers and hearers weight forward and backward associations. Our results suggest that speake rs and hearers are both calibrated and collaborative under normal conditions, but that calibrati on and collaboration tend to break down under time pressure. We collected data from the Password game show hosted by Allen Ludden on CBS. Previous re-searchers have used game show data to explore several aspect s of human decision-making [19], but to our knowledge the game of Password has not been previously studied. In each game round, a single English word (the password) is shown to speakers on tw o competing teams. With each team taking turns, the speaker gives a one-word clue to the hearer and the hearer makes a one-word guess in return. The team that performs best proceeds to the lightning rounds where the same game is played under time pressure. Our data set includes passwords , speaker-generated clues and hearer-generated guesses for 100 normal and 100 lightning rounds sa mpled from the show episodes during 1962 X 1967. Each round includes a single password and potent ially multiple clues and guesses from both teams. For all our our analyses, we use only the first clue  X  X uess pair in each round. The responses of speakers and hearers are likely to depend he avily on word associations, and we can therefore use word association data to model both speake rs and hearers. We used the word association database from the University of South Florida ( USF) for all of our analyses [20]. These data were collected using a free association task, where par ticipants were given a cue word and asked to generate a single associate of the cue. More than 6000 participants contributed to the database, and each generated associates for 100  X  120 English words. To allow for weak associates that were not generated by these participants, we added a count of 1 to t he observed frequency for each cue-target pair in the database. The forward strength ( w where w forward strength ( w Note that this normalization ensures that both forward and b ackward strengths can be treated as probabilities. The correlation between forward strengths and backward strengths is positive but low ( r = 0 . 32 ), suggesting that our game show analyses may be able to diffe rentiate the influence of forward and backward associations.
 The USF database includes associates for a set of 5016 words, and we used this set as the lexicon for all of our analyses. Some of the rounds in our game show data in clude passwords, clues or guesses that do not appear in this lexicon, and we removed these round s, leaving 68 password-clue and 68 clue-guess pairs in the normal rounds and 86 password-clue p airs and 80 clue-guess pairs in the lightning rounds. The USF database also includes the freque ncy of each word in a standard corpus of written English [21], and we use these frequencies in our fi rst analysis. Figure 2: (a) Analyses of the speaker and hearer data ( S Ranks of the human responses normalized with respect to all o ther words in the lexicon. Ranks are shown along three dimensions: forward strength ( f ), backward strength ( b ) and combined forward and backward strengths.

The four bars on the left i n each subplot show normalized counts based on comparisons with matches along the f dimension, and the four bars on the right are based on matches along the b dimension. For example, group Bb includes human responses that are better along the b dimension compared to matches along the f dimension, and groups Eb and Wb include cases where human responses are equal to or worse tha n the f -matches. Group Cf includes cases where the human response is top ranked along the f dimension. Groups Bf , Ef , Wf and Cb are defined similarly. (b) Analyses of the lightning rounds. considerate speaker, however, may attempt to generate strong backward a ssociates, which will make faced by the speaker should also take backward associates in to account. This section describes some initial analyses that explore whether clues and guesses are shaped by backward associations. speakers and hearers. A dimension is a successful predictor if the words chosen by contestants tend rank). We handle ties using fractional ranking, which means that it is sensible to compare mean ranks along each dimension. In Figure 2a.i, S (password  X  clue) strengths for the speaker, and H backward (clue  X  guess) strengths for the hearer. In addition to forward and b ackward strengths, we also considered word frequency as a predictor. Across bot h normal ( S ( S forward and backward strengths for the rest of our analyses.

For data set S S information present in the forward associations. Note, how ever, that the difference between mean ranks for S For data set H that goes beyond the forward strengths. Figure 2a.ii plots t he rank of each guess along the dimen-sions of forward and backward strength. The correlation bet ween the dimensions is relatively high, hearer data set H tions both contribute to people X  X  responses.
 Figure 2a.iii shows the results of an analysis that explores more directly whether each dimension makes a contribution that goes beyond the other. We compared each  X  X ctual word X  (i.e. each clue or guess chosen by a contestant) to  X  X atched words X  that are m atched in rank along one of the dimensions. For example, if the backward dimension matters , then the actual words should tend to be better along the b dimension than words that are matched along the f dimension. The first group worse ( Wb ) along the backward dimension than matches along the forwar d dimension. The Bb bar is higher than the others, suggesting that the backward dime nsion does indeed make a contribution that goes beyond the forward dimension. Note that a match is d efined as a word that is ranked the same as the actual word, or in cases where there are no ties , a word that is ranked one step better. The fourth bar ( Cf , for champion along the forward dimension) includes all cas es where a word is ranked best along the forward dimension, which means that no match can be found. Our policy for identifying matches is conservative X  X ll other t hings being equal, actual words should be equivalent ( Eb ) or worse ( Wb ) than the matched words, which means that the large Bb bar provides strong evidence that the backward dimension is important. A binomial test confirms that the Bb high, suggesting that the forward dimension makes a contrib ution that goes beyond the backward dimension. In other words, Figure 2a.iii suggests that both dimensions influence the responses of the speaker.
 The results for the hearer data H predicts hearer guesses better than the other. Note, for exa mple, that the second group of four bars in Figure 2a.iii suggests that the forward dimension is not p redictive once the backward dimension is taken into account ( Bf is smaller than Wf ). This result is consistent with our previous finding that forward and backward strengths are highly correlated i n the case of the hearer, and that neither dimension makes a contribution after controlling for the ot her.
 Our analyses so far suggest that forward and backward streng ths both make independent contri-butions to the choices made by speakers, but that the hearer d ata do not allow us to discriminate between these dimensions. Figure 2b shows similar analyses for the lightning rounds. The most no-table change is that backward strengths appear to play a much smaller role when speakers are placed under time pressure. For example, Figure 2b.i suggests that backward strengths are now worse than forward strengths at predicting the clues chosen by speaker s. Relative to the results for the normal rounds S Bf counts show an increase of similar scale.  X  2 goodness-of-fit tests show that the distributions of counts for both { Bb, Eb, Wb, Cf } and { Bf, Ef, Wf, Cb } in the lightning rounds significantly speakers tend to rely more heavily on forward associations t han backward associations when placed under time pressure. Table 1: Strategies for speaker and hearer. In each case we as sume that the speaker and hearer sample words from distributions p on backward associates. For each party, the strategy at leve l k is the best choice assuming that the other person uses a strategy at a level lower than k .
 Our previous analyses found little evidence that forward an d backward strengths make separate contributions in the case of the hearer, but the lightning da ta H dimensions differently: note that Bb counts decrease by 19% and Bf counts increase by 64% .  X  2 tests confirm that the distributions of { Bb, Eb, Wb, Cf } and { Bf, Ef, Wf, Cb } in the lightning (like the speaker) tends to rely on forward strengths rather than backward strengths in the lightning rounds.
 are both shaped by backward associates X  X n other words, that both parties are considerate of the analyses we considered suggest that backward associations play a role. The evidence is weaker in the case of the hearer, and only the comparison between norma l and lightning rounds suggests that backward associations play some role. Our analyses so far provide some initial evidence that speak ers and hearers are both influenced by forward and backward associations. Given this result, we no w consider a model that explores how forward and backward associations are combined in generati ng a response. 4.1 Speaker and hearer models Since both kinds of associations appear to play a role, we exp lore a simple speaker model which assumes that the clue c chosen for the password w is sampled from a mixture distribution where ( w  X  c ) indicates the forward strength from w to c , ( w  X  c ) indicates the backward strength from c to w , and  X  assumes that guess w given clue c is sampled from the mixture distribution Several possible mixture distributions for speaker and hea rer are shown in Table 1. For example, the level 1 distributions assume that both rely entirely on b ackward associates. By fitting mixture weights to the game show data we can explore the extent to whic h speaker and hearer rely on forward and backward associations.
 Bayesian inference. Using Bayes X  rule, the hearer distribu tion p To simplify our analysis we make three assumptions. First, w e assume that the prior p ( w ) in Equa-tion 4 is uniform. Second, we assume that contestants are nea r-optimal in many respects but that they sample rather than maximize. In other words, we assume t hat the hearer samples a guess w from the distribution p p words w normalizing constant is 1 and the standard deviation is 0.04 . Our final assumption simplifies matters considerably since it implies that ( w Given these assumptions it is straightforward to show that t he level 0 strategies in Table 1 are the best responses to the level 1 strategies, and vice versa. For example, if the speaker uses strategy S and samples a clue c from the distribution p hearer should sample a guess w from the distribution p if the speaker uses the strategy S then Equation 4 suggests that the hearer should sample a gues s w from the distribution p ( w  X  c ) = ( c  X  w ).
 Suppose now that the hearer is uncertain about the strategy u sed by the speaker. A level 2 hearer assumes that the speaker could use strategy S appropriate response to S More generally, suppose that a level n hearer assumes that the speaker uses a strategy from the set { S similar to Equation 5, it follows that strategy H a mixture distribution. Our Bayesian analysis therefore su ggests that efficient speakers and hearers can be characterized by the mixture models in Equations 2 and 3.
 Some pairs of mixture models are calibrated in the sense that the hearer model is the best choice given the speaker model and vice versa. Equation 4 implies th at calibration is achieved when the forward weight for the speaker matches the backward weight f or the hearer (  X  backward weight for the speaker matches the forward weight f or the hearer (  X  show contestants achieve efficient communication, then mix ture weights fit to their responses should come close to satisfying this calibration condition.
 There are many sets of weights that satisfy the calibration c ondition. For example, calibration is achieved if the speaker uses strategy S associates is more difficult than thinking about forward ass ociates, this solution seems unbalanced since the hearer alone is required to think about backward as sociates. Consistent with the principle of least collaborative effort, we make a second prediction t hat speaker and hearer will collaborate and share the communicative burden equally. More precisely , we predict that both parties will assign the same weight to backward associates and that  X  we expect that the weights which best characterize human res ponses will have  X   X 
H = 0 . 5 4.2 Fitting forward and backward mixture weights to the data To evaluate our predictions we assumed that the speaker and h earer are characterized by Equations 2 and 3 and identified the mixture weights that best fit the game s how data. Assuming that the M game rounds are independent, the log likelihood for the speaker d ata is and a similar expression is used for the hearer data. We fit the weights  X  (  X 
S +  X  S = 1 Figure 3: (a) Fitted mixture weights for the speaker ( S ) and hearer ( H ) models based on boot-strapped normal (N) and lightning (L) rounds.  X  and  X  are weights on the forward and backward strengths. (b) Log-ratios of  X  and  X  weights estimated from bootstrapped normal and lightning rounds. (c) Average response times for speakers choosing cl ues and hearers choosing guesses in normal and lightning rounds. Averages are computed over 30 r ounds randomly sampled from the game show.
 We ran separate analyses for normal and lightning rounds, an d ran similar analyses for the hearer data. 1000 estimates of each mixture weight were computed by bootstrap ping game show rounds while keeping tallies of normal and lightning rounds consta nt.
 Consistent with our predictions, the results in Figure 3a su ggest that all four mixure weights for the normal rounds are relatively close to 0 . 5 . Both speaker and hearer appear to weight forward associates slightly more heavily than backward associates , but 0 . 5 is within one standard deviation of the bootstrapped estimates in all four cases. The lightni ng rounds produce a different pattern of results and suggest that the speaker now relies much more h eavily on forward than backward to 0 (i.e.  X  =  X  ) in all cases except for the speaker in the lightning rounds. Further confidence tests show that the percentage of bootstrapped ratios exceeding 0 is 100% for the speaker in the lightning rounds, but 85% or lower in the three remaining cases. Consistent with our pr evious analyses, this result suggests that coordinating with the hearer requires some effort on the part of the speaker, and that this coordination is likely to break down under time pressure. The fitted mixture weights, backward associations. Figure 3c helps to explain why mixtu re weights for the speaker but not the hearer may differ across normal and lightning rounds. The di fference in response times between normal and lightning rounds is substantially greater for th e speaker than the hearer, suggesting that any differences between normal and lightning rounds are mor e likely to emerge for the speaker than the hearer. We studied how speakers and hearers communicate in a very sim ple context. Our results suggest that both parties take the other person X  X  perspective into a ccount, that both parties make accurate assumptions about the strategy used by the other, and that th e burden of communication is equally divided between the two. All of these conclusions support th e idea that human communication is relatively efficient. Our results, however, suggest that efficient communication is not trivial to achieve, and tends to break down when speakers are placed und er time pressure.
 Although we worked with simple models of the speaker and hear er, note that neither model is in-tended to capture psychological processing. Future studie s can explore how our models might be implemented by psychologically plausible mechanisms. For example, one possibility is that speak-ers sample a small set of words with high forward strengths, t hen choose the word in this sample with greatest backward strength. Different processing mod els might be considered, but we believe that any successful model of speaker or hearer will need to in clude some role for inferences about the other person.
