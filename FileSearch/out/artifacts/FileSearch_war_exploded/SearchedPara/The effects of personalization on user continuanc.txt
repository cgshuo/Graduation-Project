 1. Introduction
With the development of information and communication technologies, social networking is getting saturated attention these days. In particular, personal profile-based social networking sites (SNSs) such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn present many emerging opportunities in various fields by facilitating communication and social relationships. For example, social-networking-based personalization services such as the instant personalization of Facebook have emerged to more appropriately meet users X  needs ( Chen, 2012 ). These services are implemented to facilitate personal use more effectively ( Chen, 2012 ). In addition, SNSs have shown positive effects when used for marketing purposes by some commercial companies. It is also reported that the revenue of social networking service providers is expected to rapidly increase and overtake other Web 2.0 technologies such as wikis and mashups by 2013 (  X  X  X  World of Connections, X  X  2010 ).  X 
The utilization of SNSs is based on the network effects theory, which states that the value of a network increases as the number of the participatory users increases ( Reed, 1999; Shapiro &amp; Varian, 1999 ). While face-to-face information services allow a service provider to interact with only one user at a time, SNS-based services make it possible for users to interact with each other and also to the service providers themselves. This extension of the interaction ensures more reliable information through more diverse verification ( Lankes, Silverstein, &amp; Nicholson, 2007 ). The recent increase in the number of mobile contributors is helping improve the currency of information as well as the accuracy in public news or in any other information-service area.

User participation is essential for achieving these positive network effects. Particularly, continued use is highly demanded for SNSs because they have already passed the initial adoption stage and arrived at the post-adoption stage ( Boehnke, 2011;
Kim, 2011; Shiau, Huang, &amp; Shih, 2011 ). Maintaining continued users requires less effort and cost than discovering new users service providers.

A typical characteristic of SNSs is to allow users to create and maintain their own independent profile page to represent a personal image ( boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007 ). Some active users devote much time and regular effort to updating their profile pages X  design and content. This personalization helps them network with others by attracting them to their own profile page. As personalization refers to a process that changes the system X  X  functionality, interface, and content to ensure compliance with an individual user ( Blom &amp; Monk, 2003 ), it requires some time and effort.
 Personalization is believed to increase and sustain initial and post-adoption rates respectively ( Rogers, 2003 ).
Personalization that provides users with compatibility is likely to increase initial adoption rate. For post-adoption, the users should invest some time and effort to maintain their profiles, which as a result makes it difficult to switch to an alternative online service ( Kim &amp; Son, 2009 ). Such a lock-in phenomenon has also been believed to sustain the post-adoption rate. However, in participatory sites such as SNSs, somewhat different results have been reported. For example, Tiwana and
Bush (2005) found that the degree of personalization is likely to reduce the post-adoption rate of online services up to a certain threshold, then conversely it increases the rate. Park (2008) also found that personalization does not significantly influence the continuance of SNSs directly despite its positive influence on user satisfaction. Also, privacy has become a crit-ical issue in SNS personalization as more advanced and flexible personalization features such as the instant personalization of Facebook are available these days.

Despite the importance of continued use of SNSs and the differentiated and emerging effects of personalization, studies focusing on SNS personalization are very rare in the information science field. Especially, the influences of personalization on the post-adoption of SNSs is still unknown. There are some studies on personalization in relevant studies. However, their focuses and notions are different. For example, in information retrieval research, personalization is to increase the relevance of search results in a tailored interface (e.g., Clements, de Vries, &amp; Reinders, 2010; Teevan, Dumais, &amp; Horvitz, 2010 ).
Similarly, personalized recommender systems are suggested to more efficiently deal with information overload problem ( Zhou, Xu, Li, Josang, &amp; Cox, 2012 ). Considering this gap and attempting to extend the understanding of post-adoption behaviors of social websites in the social-exchange theoretical perspective, this study aims to examine the effects of personalization on user continuance intention in SNSs.

The following section reviews relevant literature on SNSs, personalization, and post-adoption. The subsequent section develops a conceptual model that provides hypotheses. In the methodology section, interviews and survey methods are described in the sense of mixed methodology. The data analyses and results are shown to test the hypotheses. This study summarizes its conclusions with a discussion of findings. 2. Related works 2.1. Post-adoption research
The information research community has often addressed post-adoption behaviors with various artifacts such as face-to-face reference services in libraries ( Durrance, 1989, 1995; Rimland, 2007 ), digital reference services ( Desai, 2003; Ross &amp;
Nielsen, 2000 ), collaborative digital reference services ( Hall, 2008 ), Web browsers ( Ye, Seo, Desouza, Sangareddy, &amp; Jha, studies have their theoretical foundations on the diffusion of innovation theory ( Rogers, 2003 ). Since its first introduction in 1962 by Everett M. Rogers, it has been one of the most cited works in communication studies and other social science areas. Among several its contributions, the major ones include the discovery of the four elements of diffusion process (innovation itself, communication channel, time, and social system) and the five-stage model in the innovation-decision process (knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation). Especially, these three last stages of the five-stage model, decision, implementation, and confirmation stages, are the origin of the initial adoption and post-adoption studies in various fields. The terms,  X  X  X ontinued adoption X  X  and  X  X  X iscontinuance X  X  ( Rogers, 2003, p.170 ) was used for the post-adoption behaviors. Under this background, this study also uses  X  X  X ser continuance X  X  to represent post-adoption behaviors.
Following the tradition of the diffusion of innovation research, the related post-adoption studies introduced above emphasized individual users X  perceptions, which assumes that the fit between an individual user X  X  rational needs (e.g., perceived accuracy, perceived usefulness) and the characteristics of the information artifacts (e.g., reference services, Web browsers) mainly facilitates the continued use of these artifacts. For instance, a public library user can stop using a certain reference service if the user feels the answers received are inaccurate.

However, these studies have ignored the situations where users cannot make free and voluntary decisions. In an SNS-use situation, initially, the users may interact with their friends or other users through various channels such as comments and replies, photos, video clips, and recommendations. As time goes on, the users may build and enhance their social relation-ships by having cumulatively added more and more interactions. These past interactive activities do not simply disappear, but remain as traces of the users X  investments in terms of effort and time. These traces are similar as what is called  X  X  X nscrip-tion X  X  ( Latour &amp; Woolgar, 1986 ) of the social relationships. Due to these prior investments, the users are in a position where they cannot easily switch to another SNS service. In other words, the users perceive that they should repeat a similar amount of investment in order to construct a similar strength of social relationships in a new SNS. If the perceived amount of past investment is bigger than the benefit of switching to another new SNS, they would probably remain with the current SNS even if they are dissatisfied with it. Unlike other post-adoption behaviors, the lock-in phenomenon ( Shapiro &amp; Varian, 1999 ) appears in SNS continuous use. Understanding this phenomenon leads to understanding the concepts of switching cost and satisfaction along with personalization. Thus, it is necessary to investigate this distinct post-adoption phenomenon to better understand interactive behaviors in SNSs.

The previous section proposes the concepts of lock-in phenomenon, switching cost, and satisfaction to better explain the effects of personalization on SNS continuous use. These concepts are closely related to the social exchange theory upon which the present study is theoretically based. 2.2. Social exchange theory
The social exchange theory assumes that people conduct certain social behaviors as the result of maximizing the potential taining a less-than-optimal relationship (e.g., where there is a dissimilarity in career goals) outweigh the benefits of the rela-tionship (e.g., shared feelings and thoughts), people are likely to terminate that relationship. According to Thibaut and Kelley (1959) , regarding social exchange theory, people also compare their outcomes in current relationships to expectations de-rived from past relationships and to the quality of available alternative relationships. The expectations are called comparison level (CL), which refers to  X  X  X he standard against which the member evaluates the  X  X  X ttractiveness X  X  of the relationship or how refers to  X  X  X he lowest level of outcomes a member will accept in the light of available alternative opportunities X  X  (p. 21).
These three concepts (outcomes, CL, and CLalt) serve as a framework for understanding why individual persons are moti-vated to either increase or decrease relationships (see Table 1 ). There are four different situations according to relative hier-archical level of outcomes, CL, and CLalt. When outcomes are higher than both CL and CLalt (outcomes &gt; CL &gt; CLalt), as in situation A, current perceived benefits (outcomes) are higher than both expectations (CL) and the quality of alternative relationships (CLalt). A person in this situation is likely to continue the relationship and develop the relationship further be-cause the person is satisfied with the outcomes and recognizes the higher quality of outcomes than the alternatives. Con-versely, in situation B where outcomes are lower than both CL and CLalt (CLalt &gt; CL &gt; outcomes), a person is likely to decrease the relationship and seek potential alternative relationships because the person is dissatisfied with the outcomes and recognizes the higher quality of alternatives than the current outcomes. In situation C, a person is likely to terminate current relationships and seek alternative ones even though the person is satisfied with the outcomes. This is because the quality of potential alternative relationships is perceived to be higher than that of the outcomes. Finally, in situation D, a person cannot help but continue the current relationships despite the person X  X  dissatisfaction. This is because no other po-tential choice is available since the quality of alternative relationships is lower than that of the current outcomes. This is also called  X  X  X onvoluntary relationship X  X  ( Thibaut &amp; Kelley, 1959, p. 23 ) in this sense.

As seen in Table 1 , the social exchange theory is very parsimonious and easy to understand. However, the assumption includes that human act is based on rational decision making and the relationship is limited to dyadic ( Cook, Cheshire, Eric, &amp; Nakagawa, 2013 ). Despite such limitations, the social exchange theory is well applicable to SNS-related studies in two as-posits that human behaviors and their contexts should be understood through their relationships to other elements. This overarching structural view matches well with social networking phenomena such as network effects, switching costs, and lock-in. The other aspect can be found in the prevalence of social exchange phenomena on the Web. Various social media such as social networking sites, professional networking services, and collaborative systems support social exchanges through interactive and participatory-based functions. For example, a Facebook user can update and share the wall contents with his/her linked friends. These activities are in some extent stimulated by the perceptual exchange of benefits and re-wards which are the core components of the social exchange theory. Considering these two, the present study finds that this theory is well suited for SNS studies.

As noted earlier, the social exchange theory provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between the present study X  X  variables. In the relationship of personalization in SNSs, two variables (satisfaction and switching costs) are identified as key balancing factors in the social exchange perspective. As seen in Table 1 , degrees of satisfaction and switching cost are expected to vary across the four different social exchange situations. While both satisfaction and switch-ing cost are high in situation A, both are low in situation B. In situation C and D, either satisfaction or switching cost is rel-atively high. Satisfaction here refers to an SNS user X  X  favorable feelings toward the SNS, and switching cost refers to any negative cost that an SNS user might incur as a result of changing to an alternative SNS. For the instance of situation D, when a Facebook user builds a large scale of social relationships and a large amount of profile content on Facebook, the switching cost would be too high to change to an alternative SNS such as MySpace in spite of the user X  X  dissatisfaction with its service.
Due to the social relationship that is already built, it would be hard for the user to discontinue using Facebook. In situation A where both satisfaction and switching cost are high, an SNS user would have no reason to change to other SNSs. However, in situation B, an SNS user would probably move to another SNS because both two variables are low. This situation is possible in a scenario such as the user not having built a large scale of social relationships or profile contents. In situation C, however, an SNS user would either continue or discontinue to use the SNS depending upon specific conditions. Either high satisfaction degree or low switching cost degree would lead to continued or discontinued use, respectively. These varying degrees of sat-isfaction and switching cost provide a theoretical rationale for further developing a conceptual framework and research hypotheses. 2.3. Personalization
Personalization is known as the process of customizing an information system X  X  functionality, interface, and contents to a user X  X  demands. It is also widely known that it benefits the users with more suitable offerings. For instance, in online banking services, clients prefer more personalized banking services to standardized ones. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of personalization of information services. While the first type allows users to select and create their preferred features, items, contents, relationships or offerings by themselves, the other provides users more suitable offerings based on logged data such as usage patterns, hyper-linking patterns, and user profiles.

This study considers both types of personalization because the users are likely to adapt their SNS to meet their needs and set it up to use logged data the way they want to. For example, one of Facebook X  X  recent personalization features X  X alled instant personalization X  X llows other websites to use Facebook X  X  profile information if the user opts in. When the user logs in, other websites such as shopping mall sites personalize their web services based on the user X  X  Facebook information. After initial use, data such as preferred content and frequently viewed items are added to the Facebook member X  X  database. As a result, other websites could access richer data sets, which enables them to provide more personalized web services.
It is also noted that personalization in this study should be conceptually distinguishable from the concept of engagement, though they are related. While the personalization refers to the update and maintenance of SNS users X  profile pages, engage-ment is concerned with interactive activities as a whole and it refers to the overall quality of user interactive experiences with a system ( Lehmann, Lalmas, Yom-Tov, &amp; Dupret, 2012; O X  X rien, 2010; O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2010 ). For example, SNS users can actively engage by communicating with their friends without personalization such as maintaining their friend list, pro-file contents, or any other updates. However, personalization can result in engagement. 2.4. SNSs and related research In the information science literature, some early SNS studies focus on key components and definitions of SNSs. boyd and
Ellison (2007) draw essential elements from reviewing relevant studies on topics such as the functions of making and maintaining personal profiles; constructing social networks with other users by maintaining friend lists; and traversing the social networks constructed. While boyd and Ellison (2007) are stressing making networks themselves and excluding social networking with strangers, Beer (2008) defines SNSs in a broader sense by conceptualizing social networking as a communicative behavior, which includes social networking with strangers. There is a conceptual difference between the two, however, both acknowledge these two elements as the core for SNSs: making personal profiles and social networking with people through those profiles.

SNS characteristics and functions are another topic of previous studies. SNSs have various specific features and service functions and they practically distinguish them from similar social media such as blogs and video sharing sites (e.g.,
YouTube). Richter and Koch (2008) propose the following six functions of SNSs: to manage identity, to search various infor-mation, to share knowledge, to set up networks, to manage human resources, and to exchange information. These six func-tions can be summarized as: managing personal profiles and communicating with friends through social networking. Madgea, Meekb, Wellensc, and Hooleyd (2009) examine the role of Facebook on undergraduate students X  university life.
They compare Facebook X  X  network of pre-registration and their social network of post-registration to examine the impact of the SNS on their social network. The results indicate that the SNS plays the role of  X  X ocial glue X  that supports the students X  university life, however, face-to-face interactions are still an important factor for social networking. Relevantly, Lai (2014) explores how an online service facilitates offline engagement, which is called  X  X  X ixed-mode X  X  or  X  X  X ode-switching. X  X  These service users voluntarily gather and organize themselves in a virtual space and then meet and interact in the real world. The findings indicate that these groups interact with other groups and the local community in various ways.

Some studies deal with SNS user satisfaction and adoption. Joinson (2008) examines motivations for use and satisfaction for SNSs. Based on survey responses from Facebook users, the following seven motivations are identified: social networks, shared identities, photographs, content, social investigation, social network surfing, and status updating. These motivational factors are also related to the SNS core components that enable personal profiles and social networks, which were mentioned earlier. Regarding the change of satisfaction level, Patchin and Hinduja (2010) examine adolescents X  MySpace profiles across time by applying content analysis, and find that the youth become more cautious in posting private information and a large number of them seem to no longer use the SNS because of the potential risks in social relationships. This supports that the social relational aspects seem a critical factor in deciding the continuous use of SNSs. Sledgianowski and Kulviwat (2009) examine the factors influencing the adoption of Facebook and MySpace. Based on 289 valid survey responses from university students, they identify playfulness, perceived critical mass, trust, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness as the main influencing factors. Among these, playfulness and perceived critical mass show the strongest influences. It is interesting to notice that perceived critical mass is related to network effects as it refers to the degree to which a user perceives that en-ough people already use a specific SNS. As mentioned earlier, the network effects of SNSs lead to lock-in phenomenon and thus to incur switching costs, which is one of main constructs of the present study. 3. Theoretical model development Fig. 1 depicts a conceptual framework that the present study proposes for examination of the effect of personalization on SNS continuance use intention. The major assumption is based on the effects having two balancing powers: benefits and cost.
Social exchange theory supports this theoretical foundation and the relationship between variables of satisfaction and switching cost (see Table 1 ). By this perspective, the present study conceptualizes the relationship between personalization and continuance intention in SNSs by integrating satisfaction and switching cost. Regarding these, this section provides hypotheses and their theoretical rationales.

Personalization in SNSs differs from traditional personalization. The interactive nature of SNSs encourages users to more frequently update and maintain their social relations, personal information and comments, and interfaces of their profile pages than non-interactive information systems. In the instance of Facebook, submenu items such as Wall, Info, Photos, and Friends under the Profile main menu support those updating and maintaining activities. Interactions through leaving and replying to comments on the Wall, for example, customize Facebook and as a result create unique and sophisticatedly personalized contents.

Personalization is expected to influence satisfaction and thus possibly change continuance intention. With personaliza-tion features such as profile and relationship customization, and self-set privacy settings providing flexibility for users, the extent of personalization may increase satisfaction and continuance intention. In his diffusion of innovation theory, Rogers (2003) also indicates that personalization positively influences initial and continuous use of an innovation. More specifically, personalization of an information system has a positive relationship with the satisfaction of that system.

However, recent developments in SNS personalization (e.g., Facebook instant personalization) have increased not only flexibility and compatibility, but also the risk of privacy revelation as personalized contents such as Wall comments are al-lowed to be available to other websites for further personalized services if the users agree to it ( Dwyer, Hiltz, &amp; Passerini, 2007 ). Accordingly, it is expected that personalization is an influencing source of satisfaction and continued use in SNS environments.
 H1. The extent of personalization in an SNS will positively affect a user X  X  satisfaction with the SNS.
 H4. The extent of personalization in an SNS will positively affect a user X  X  continuance intention with the SNS.
InSNSs,whilepersonalizationfeaturesimproveusercompatibility intheearlystageofadoption,inthepost-adoptionstage, where a number of social relationships have already been constructed, it requires a certain amount of time and effort to main-tain these relationships. As a larger number of social relationships emerge, more time and effort will be necessary to maintain them. This leads to more social networks locking the user in their SNS and making it harder to switch to alternative SNSs.
A typical characteristic of SNS personalization is that the SNS is integrated with a user X  X  personal and social contexts through a number of interactions and communications with the user X  X  social ties. This allows each user to create and main-tain his or her own profile page to represent a personal image. This personalization contributes to the creation of a personal identity and as a result, to an increase in switching costs ( Burnham, Frels, &amp; Mahajan, 2003; Kim &amp; Son, 2009; McCracken, 1986 ). This leads to the following hypothesis: H2. The extent of personalization in an SNS will positively affect perceived switching costs of the SNS.

It is generally known that continued use is different from initial use ( Bhattacherjee, 2001 ). The diffusion of innovation theory suggests that five stages emerge sequentially when a certain innovation is adopted. These are (1) knowledge, (2) per-suasion, (3) decision, (4) implementation, and (5) confirmation ( Rogers, 2003 ). At the decision stage, people make a decision whether or not to initially adopt an innovation, while the knowledge and persuasion stages are related to awareness and attitude formation respectively. The confirmation stage, on the other hand, allows the users to reevaluate the adopted inno-vation to make a decision whether or not to continually use the innovation. Thus, continuance intention refers to an indi-vidual X  X  intention to continue using a social networking site after having previously adopted it.

In relation to continuance, many studies suggest that satisfaction, which refers to a user X  X  favorable feelings toward a ser-vice ( Seddon, 2004 ), causes continued use of a certain service (e.g., Bhattacherjee, 2001; Fornell, 1992 ). Similarly, Ye et al. (2008) examine factors influencing users X  post-adoption switching behavior to the Mozilla Firefox Web browser. In their study, satisfaction with the present Web browser significantly enhances the continuous use of the Web browser by hinder-ing the switching behavior. Kim and Han (2009) also confirm that satisfaction as a trust antecedent plays an significant role in enhancing post-adoption of community-driven knowledge sites such as Yahoo Answers. These previous studies imply that in an SNS environment, satisfaction will affect continuance intention. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed: H3. A user X  X  satisfaction with an SNS will positively affect the user X  X  continuance intention with the SNS.

Switching costs, on the contrary, are conceptualized as any negative costs that are incurred as a result of changing to an alternative one. Burnham et al. (2003) identify three types of switching costs: procedural, financial, and relational switching costs. Procedural switching cost is related to the loss occurred in time and effort; financial switching cost is the loss in mon-etary resources; and relational switching cost is the loss in personal identity and image due to the breaking of social rela-tionships, which as a result causes psychological and emotional discomfort. The present study applies the first and the third type of switching cost and excludes the second one because switching to an alternative does not involve any monetary cost in SNS-use environments.

Regarding relational switching costs, social relationships already built in an online network strengthen willingness to stay in the networks further. For example, a Facebook user connected to 500 friends would find it more difficult to switch to an-other SNS than a user with 50 Facebook friends. This lock-in phenomenon enhances a user X  X  unwillingness to move to alter-natives and stay on the current one. An user X  X  self-image and social cues constructed through such social relationship building in a certain period of time would also contribute to the lock-in ( Tiwana &amp; Bush, 2005 ). Similarly, regarding the pro-cedural switching costs, as switching costs increase, e-commerce users find it hard to change to another site because they already invested a certain amount of time and effort on learning how to use the site ( Gefen, 2002 ). Several studies report that switching cost is closely related to the continued use of certain services ( Burnham et al., 2003; Dick &amp; Basu, 1994;
Kim &amp; Son, 2009 ). These studies support the idea that as the extent of these investments increases, the switching costs of the networks also increases. Taken together, the following hypothesis is generated: H5. Perceived switching costs of an SNS will positively affect a user X  X  continuance intention with the SNS.
 4. Methods
This study followed a mixed approach that is characterized by quantitative data collection and analyses integrated with qualitative data collection and analyses. Such mixed methods seek better reliability and clarity of results through so called triangulation and complementarity respectively ( Creswell, 2003; Lopez-Fernandez &amp; Molina-Azorin, 2011 ). The present study tries to more clarify the results obtained by quantitative method by also applying qualitative method. The results of the interview data analyses are used to assist with the findings of the survey data analyses, which means priority is given to survey analyses because the generalizability of the quantitative analyses is believed to better contribute to achieving the goal of this study. 4.1. Measurements
Measurement scales for the quantitative data collection were elicited from previously verified instruments. The measures of personalization were adapted from Burnham et al. (2003) for measuring the degree of personalization activities (three items). To address the elements of satisfaction, three items were borrowed from Kim and Son (2009) ; five items for perceived switching cost measure were adapted from Gefen (2002) ; continuance intention was measured with three items from Bhatt-acherjee (2001) and two items from Kim and Son (2009) . A seven-point Likert scale was used for all the above measures an-chored with 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. For control variables such as age, gender, SNS experience, and SNS usage, a single-item scale was used. The specific scale items are shown in Table 2 .

All the constructs in this study were examined to ensure reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. First, reliability is established if Cronbach X  X  alpha and composite reliability exceed acceptable levels (0.7 for both; Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988 ). As shown in Table 3 , all the constructs are greater than 0.7 and thus satisfy this criterion. Second, convergent validity Factor loadings for all the items were greater than 0.6 (see Table 4 ), thus the criteria for convergent validity was satisfied.
Last, discriminant validity was examined by applying the average variance extracted (AVE) of a measure. If this value is 0.5 or greater than its squared correlation coefficients with the other measures, this validity is met ( Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981; Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2009 ). Table 3 shows that all the AVE values are well above 0.5 and the off-diagonal values, which satisfies this criteria.

To assess the measurement model, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed. The analysis results were as-sessed by using six common fit indices: the chi-square/degree of freedom ( v 2/df), the comparative fit index (CFI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the goodness-of-fit index (GFI), the adjusted goodness of fit (AGFI), and the nonnormed fit index (NNFI). A recommended value for each index is reported as follows: v 2/df &lt; 5.00; CFI P 0.95;
RMSEA 6 0.06; GFI P 0.90; AGFI P 0.80; NNFI P 0.95 ( Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988; Gefen, Straub, &amp; Boudreau, 2000; Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999 ). The results indicated that all the fit index values satisfied their respective recommended threshold ( v 2/df = 3.294;
CFI = 0.939; RMSEA = 0.067; GFI = 0.92; AGFI = 0.824; NNFI = 0.953). Thus, the measurement model seems to fit well with the data. 4.2. Data collection and analyses
The data collection consisted of three phases. First, when the initial version of the survey questionnaire was prepared, it was reviewed by three professors knowledgeable in survey research. Their feedback recommended that the measures of the continuance intention should be toward the extent of continuance intention rather than the use or nonuse intention. Accord-ingly, the following two items were added:  X  X  X n the next four weeks, how often will you visit the SNS? X  X  and  X  X  X  intend to visit the SNS during the next four weeks within the following frequency. X  X  Third, a pilot test was undertaken to examine internal consistency reliability. Sixty-nine Facebook users participated. The pilot Web-survey questionnaire was posted on Facebook Walls to invite its users. The Cronbach X  X  alphas for the pilot test were all over 0.8, which is good for further study.
Second, a field survey was administered for one month from July 22, 2012 to August 21, 2012 to collect the necessary data for testing the model and hypotheses. The survey questionnaire was posted on the Web on surveymonkey.com. A cover letter attached introduced the study purpose, the benefit of response, and ensured the respondents X  privacy. The present study considers the population of interest as university student users of SNSs in the United States. Then, publicly available student email addresses from six universities in the United States were collected manually and randomly, reaching 3000 in total.
Specifically, the sampling frame was a list of 3000 cleaned email addresses manually harvested from each of the six univer-sities (18,000 in total), and then 500 addresses were randomly selected from each list, leaving a list of 3000 email addresses.
The universities were the California Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, Syracuse University, University of Chi-cago, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and University of Washington. The Web-survey system had an automatic opt-out feature for invalid email addresses. 82 email addresses were removed, leaving 2918 in total. At the end of the survey data collection, 846 visitors had clicked the survey link, and 771 responses were submitted, representing a response rate of 26.4%. Out of the submitted responses, 94 incomplete ones were excluded, which leaves 677 usable responses. This yields an effective response rate of 23.2%.

As the final phase, personal interviews were conducted with individual SNS users and analyzed. Six undergraduate stu-dents and nineteen graduate students were asked to express their thoughts on the SNS that they use most frequently in their daily life. The interview questions were about personalization activities and their reasons for using or not using an SNS. Then the transcribed interview data was analyzed following the constant comparative technique ( Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967 ). Each assertion of the interview responses was the unit of analysis and these were classified based on 24 emergent categories (e.g., archiving memory, reducing social costs, many friends in service, no friends in service, no trust, privacy, social cues_cre-ating an image, and social cues_sympathy). Then these categories were collapsed once more according to the constructs of this study. For example, reducing social costs and social cues_creating an image was collapsed into the satisfaction. It is nota-ble that since the purpose of this interview data analysis was to support the quantitative findings complementarily, only the relevant assertions and respective categories were presented in this study. 5. Results 5.1. Demographics
The respondents X  background characteristics and SNS usage are presented in Table 5 . The percentage of age group ranging from 19 to 23 is highest and the proportion in each age group declines with age except the age group of 18 or younger. Over thirty four percent of the respondents have used at least one SNS for over 5 years, and over thirty nine percent of them log in two to four times a day. When they log on, the largest proportion of them visit other users X  profiles (25.4%) and leave comments on other users X  profile pages (22.7%), which accounts for 48.1%. This usage pattern supports that SNS users X  main activities are concerned with maintaining social relationship with others. However, most users spend less than 30 min per each log on (71.8%). 5.2. Test of hypotheses and interview responses
The proposed model with five hypotheses ( Fig. 1 ) was tested by using a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique through the IBM SPSS Amos (version 20). SEM is a well-accepted analysis technique in several social science areas and has several beneficiary potentials for information science field as well. These potentials include hypotheses testing in path models and latent variable measurement with reduced errors ( Du, 2009 ).

As in Fig. 2 , it represents all of the five hypotheses were supported and the personalization has two distinct effects on the continuous use of SNSs. In the model, one antecedent variable (personalization) was specified as an exogenous variable, and the three outcome variables (satisfaction, perceived switching cost, and continuous intention) were endogenous variables.
Variations in the endogenous variables were 54% for satisfaction, 16% for perceived switching cost, and 55% for continuous intention, which reflects 42% of variation on average. All variations were based on the standardized model.

Fig. 2 and Table 6 show the significant paths among the variables. The results highlight the fact that personalization had positive effects on both satisfaction and perceived switching cost ( H1 and H2 supported). As expected, satisfaction and per-ceived switching cost significantly affected the continuance intention in SNSs ( H3 and H5 supported). Personalization was also found to significantly affect the continuance intention ( H4 supported). Therefore, all the hypotheses proposed were supported.
These effects were also supported by the interview data from the SNS users. Regarding the effects of personalization and perceived switching cost on the continuous use, Table 7 and the following interview quotes reflect both the benefits and the constraints affecting willingness to use SNSs.

As indicated in Table 7 , some of the respondents seem to communicate with their friends via the SNS even though they are not quite satisfied with it (no. of codes = 20; 10.4%). For them, club membership seems to be a major unwanted constraint that made them continue to use the SNS. This unwilling participation is related to perceived switching cost because they believed that there would be an unwanted cost X  X embership cancellation X  X f they stopped using it. The following three quotes show that having a large number of friends seems to be a major facilitator for the continued use of SNSs.
These respondents mentioned that they were influenced by the SNSs that their close friends use. If they had no friends interacting with them, then they would stop using it. In this case, the constraint would be the number of close friends avail-able. In other words, if they could communicate with their friends through an SNS, the respondents would use it. (Note: the quotes were translated from Korean.)
I cannot help but use the SNS because my club is there and I have a membership. Actually, I don X  X  really enjoy using the SNS, but to participate in the club, I should post some messages and update my profile.
 essary to use the SNS except as a blog.

When my friends stopped using Cyworld, I also no longer used it. Recently, I began to use Facebook and Twitter, but I don X  X  like to add more friends and I don X  X  have any actual close friends on the SNSs, so I seldom use them.
 While the above responses reflect the lock-in phenomenon, the following responses show positive attitudes towards
SNSs. These several positive perceptions reflect satisfaction in using SNSs as shown in Table 7 . For example, one likes to use a SNS because they can create a user image easily ( Table 7 , no. of codes = 19; 9.8%):
Filling it (SNS) in with my own rather than with others X  information ... lets others know about me, and it may be a means to express myself.

The other group of responses indicate that SNSs reduce the costs for maintaining social relationships among friends ( Ta-ble 7 , no. of codes = 30; 15.5%). This benefit would be the most widely known feature of SNSs that enables users to connect to each other across time and space. The following are examples of this theme:
Even though we are best friends we cannot contact each other every day. But in Internet space, others can know how I am living even without direct contact with me.

Since we both are busy, we cannot contact each other frequently. It (SNS) is such an advantage as it gives us a chance to contact each other again and it also helps me catch up on my friends X  lives without asking directly.
 Facebook allows me to make international friends, so I like it.

Another group of responses indicates that people use SNSs as a channel for feeling sympathy for their friends or acquain-tances ( Table 7 , no. of codes = 6; 3.1%). Private talk allows the users to share their thoughts secretly.

When I cannot express my mind verbally to others, it (SNS) enables me to show my current situation indirectly to my friends or acquaintances so that they can help me ... 6. Discussion and conclusion
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of personalization on user continuance intention in SNSs. Along with the saturated interest of SNSs, personal-profile-based SNSs facilitate communication and social relationships in a variety of fields such as marketing and advertising. All these uses are based on the assumption that the value of an SNS increases exponentially as the number of members increases ( Reed, 1999; Shapiro &amp; Varian, 1999 ). User participation is thus an essen-tial element to sustain such network value. Unlike other non-participatory media, SNS personalization, which is reflected by updates and maintenance of profile pages, results in participation. The focus of this study, however, is whether the motiva-tion for using SNSs occurs from intrinsic (satisfaction) or extrinsic factors (switching cost; lock-in perception). Considering these as a whole, this study hypothesized and empirically tested the influence of personalization on continuous use via sat-isfaction and perceived switching cost.

The measurement and structural model test provided empirical evidence for supporting the proposed model. The struc-tural model proved a goodness-of-fit to the data, and all of the path coefficients were found to be significant. Consistent with this study X  X  proposed model, the findings based on real SNS users show that personalization influences both satisfaction and perceived switching cost, which eventually leads to influencing continuance intention in SNS use. These two types of influ-ence reflect not only the intrinsic perceptions of SNSs, but also that locked-in perception affects the ongoing use of SNSs.
This study has the following research and practical implications. In terms of theoretical implications, this study contrib-utes to the information science research by suggesting a new perspective to SNS personalization and its influence on SNS continuance. While most previous studies consider only the positive aspects of personalization (e.g., Clements et al., 2010; Teevan et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2012 ), such as customization to fit situated needs, this study newly found that some
SNS users would also use SNSs just because they were locked in, not because they were satisfied with them. It implies that the findings of these intrinsic and extrinsic factors provide a better understanding than previous studies of complex social networking behaviors. In the information science field, switching costs have seldom been examined although the network effects have been discussed (e.g., Lankes et al., 2007; Pomerantz, 2006 ). Furthermore, the past studies dealt with these key concepts only theoretically and did not test empirically based on any theory or model. This finding would also provide a new insight on research concerning participatory networks such as SNSs. In addition, this study contributes to expanding the horizon of post-adoption studies focusing on SNSs. While previous studies have focused on the process and reasons for the post-adoption of various media and technologies, only a few have focused on post-adoption phenomena of SNSs. (e.g.,
Boehnke, 2011; Kim, 2011; Park, 2008; Shiau et al., 2011 ). None of these studies have applied social exchange theory in gen-erating and testing hypotheses. Upon these, the present study contributes to the information science literature by empiri-cally confirming the effect of the two factors on the post-adoption behaviors; discovering and suggesting the use of switching costs concept; and applying social exchange theory into social networking phenomena.

From a practical perspective, this study provides new insights to SNS designers by identifying how personalization influences SNS continuance intentions. The findings suggest that the designers should consider both intrinsic and extrinsic factors together when allowing personalization features on SNSs. More specifically, the path coefficients of the key variables imply that the designers may want to impose more personalization features in order to sustain a number of users since personalization have both significant coefficients towards the two factors (Personalization ? Satisfaction: b = 0.38;
Personalization ? Switching Cost: b = 0.16). Also as personalization influences directly the continuance intention (Personalization ? Continuance Intention: b = 0.23), personalization feature would result in increasing post-adoption rate.
As users would compare between the intrinsic factor and the extrinsic factor when they participate in using SNSs, the functions and features of SNSs could be designed to support these two factors. First, incorporating switching-costs tracking functions into the SNS design is one way to sustain the continued use. These functions should be visible indicators that track an user X  X  switching costs over time. The designers should consider including visible indicators such as: amount of time and efforts invested in creating and maintaining contents; strength of social relationships with connected friends; and amount of emotional investments. These reduce the likelihood of switching to other services because they more recognize their past costs for maintaining their relationships with other users.

Second, a SNS should enhance satisfaction by increasing user awareness of other users X  successful use cases of SNSs. For example, features such as: success story with SNS use; and utilization tips allow users to recognize potential usefulness.
These features increase the perceptions on potential value of SNS and result in reduce the possibilities of changing into other services. In addition, while personalization increases satisfaction it is also necessary to enhance easy use of personalization features. Drawing upon the technology acceptance literatures, one suggestion is that a SNS should have adequate amount of personalization features which increase ease of use. It appears that too much personalization features which reduce ease of use would decrease satisfaction conversely. For more reliable relationship of these, further study is necessary.
Despite those contributions in research and practical perspectives, like other research, the findings should be understood within its inherent limitations. First, the respondents of the Web survey do not represent the whole population despite the relatively large sample size ( n = 677). Due to the practical constraints, the response rate was 23.2%. This study tried to some-what complement this limitation by conducting in-person interviews with 25 SNS users. Second, the theoretical model could be too simplified as it overlooked some variables and paths. For instance, according to the familiarity of SNS, the degree of influences would be different. Lastly, this study did not consider external factors such as SNS providers X  policies and infra-structure, and individual differences such as demographics and SNS user experiences. Further studies can take into account these limitations.
