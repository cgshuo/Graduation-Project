 With the rapid increase in online video services, video retrieval systems are becoming increasingly important search tools to many users in many different fields. In this poster we present a novel video retrieval interface, which su pports the creation of multiple search  X  X acets X , to aid users ca rrying out complex, multi-faceted search tasks. The interface allows multiple searches to be executed and viewed simultaneously, and allo ws material to be reorganized between the facets. An experiment is presented which compares the faceted interface to a tabbed interface similar to that on modern web browsers, and some preliminary results are given. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ] Human Factors, Desi gn, Experimentation production environments is leading to the need for flexible video retrieval systems which deal with complex, multi-faceted searches. Recent work, such as that represen ted by the TRECVid effort [1], tackles some of the most difficult problems of content based video retrieval. As content based video becomes used more there will be a need for interfaces to support more complex, multi-faceted searches than those currently used in TR ECVid. For example, researchers and journalists in the broadcasting industry often need to investigate broad topics on which they are not experts, requiring them to explore and learn about a topic, which also finding high quality shots for use in production. In this work, we present a faceted retrieval interface, which aims to support such complex information needs, aiding the user in organizing queries and associated search results, and supporting explorative search [4].
 support is Task A, used in the evaluation reported here, entitled  X  X eflections on international politics at the end of 2005 X . It used a situated work task [2] to define a context for the user, and the task involved finding material reflecting the most important political events and people in the TRECVid 2006 dataset. The aim was to reflect a real world task as far as possible, and we expect that many narrower search ta sks will be part of such larger, broader search tasks. For example, finding shots of people can be considered as part of task A, and is a common TRECVid topic. interaction between some facets. For example, both  X  X ony Blair X  and  X  X eorge Bush X  may be facets of Task A. In searching for each of these individuals, there may be a degree of overlap in returned results, e.g. situations where bot h politicians are present together. The performance of content based video retrieval systems is currently very low when compared to text systems (e.g. [1]), meaning that shots relevant to  X  X ony Blair X  may easily appear as results for the related  X  X eorge Bush X  query, or vice-versa. Being able to easily reorganize material between facets is therefore an important part of our interface. whether a search interface supporti ng facets allowed a user to better explore a complex search task compared to a conventional interface. In the current work, it is the  X  X xplora tion X  of the task that is of most interest to us, estimated by th ree measures: (1) the number of searches executed; (2) the number of shots found (marked as relevant); and (3) the number of facets created. an existing video retrieval system, described in [3]. It is split into one or more vertical panels , each panel representing a single facet of a larger task. Each panel can be used to enter different queries, and will display the corresponding queries X  search results. When initially started, a single panel is displayed; new panels can be created using the  X  X dd X  button on the top left of the screen. Following the yellow numbers on Figure 1, each panel contains: (1) name for the panel which can be provided by the user; (2) delete icon which deletes the entire panel; (3) a key shot intended to be used as a visual exemplar for the panel, selected by the user; (4) left and right arrows, which will move th e panel left or right within the overall sequence; (5) search box and button, allowing the user to enter a textual query and start a search; (6) pull down list of queries already carried out in that panel; (7) list of relevant shots, as selected by the user for that panel; and (8) a list of search results. be dragged and dropped between panels, and from the result lists to the relevant lists. There is no restriction on where a shot can be dragged; it is possible to freely drag shots between panels, allowing the reorganization of material across the interface. to the faceted interface, but each search panel was displayed in a separate tab, only one of which could be displayed on screen at the same time, aping the tabbed browsing available in current web browsers. No interaction (copying) between the panels was supported in this version. users as blocking factors, and the order of presentation of task and system balanced. Two tasks were used: Task A was as described in the introduction, while Task B asked the user to summarize the trial of Saddam Hussein. The video data used was from TRECVid 2006 [1]. The three hypothesizes were th at the faceted interface would (a) result in a larger number of searches; (b) more shots would be found; and (c) more facets would be created. Figure 1: The faceted search interface, with 3 panels (facets) male, the median age being 26. Before starting each of the two tasks, users were provided with training on the appropriate interface (a pre-recorded tutorial plus time to carry out a training task), before starting the search task which would last for 30 minutes. On completion of the task, the user was then presented with a post-task questionnaire. The second task then proceeded in the same manner as the first, with tasks and systems changed. After both tasks were administered, the user would be given a final exit questionnaire. All users were paid  X 10 for taking part. three measures of exploration, by task and system. The number of facets reported in Table 3 are a count of the number of tabs or panels open at the end of each search task. An ANOVA indicated that there was no significant difference between number of searches and system, and number of facets and system, but there was a significant interaction between the number of shots marked relevant and system (F = .699, p &lt; .05). However, for Task A, users found more shots with the faceted interface; for Task B the opposite occurs. While other significant inte ractions were not found, Table 1 does show a slight decrease in the number of searches carried out in the faceted interface. In Table 3 mo re facets were created using the faceted interface in Task A; for Task B, there is a slight decrease in the number of facets. different, Task A appearing to be a better match to the faceted interface, suggesting it may be  X  X roader X  than Task B. To check this, we looked at the level of ag reement between the sets of found shots, assuming that there will be less agreement between users for broader tasks, which require a greater degree of interpretation. For Task A, 634 unique shots were found by all users, of which 94 were selected by 2 or more users (almost 15%). For Task B, 557 unique shots were found, 259 of which were selected by 2 or more users (46%). This greater agreement between users for Task B is consistent with Task B being the more focused task, backed up by Table 1 (less searches were exec uted for B than A) and Table 3 (number of facets on B was roughly equal for both interfaces). benefit to the faceted search inte rface: almost double the number of facets were created, and more shots were found. This must be balanced, however, with the results on task B, which suggest that for the  X  X arrower X  task, the faceted interface actually performs worse. This can be explained by the design of the two interfaces: the tabbed interface uses the entire sc reen to show a single search, unlike the faceted search where each panel is restricted to roughly  X  of the screen X  X  space  X  wasted space if the user is able to carry out all their searches in a single panel. interface can improve the degree of exploration in broad search tasks. However for narrower task s, a conventional tabbed search interface would appear to be better. One possible reason for this is the relative lack of screen space used for each panel when compared to a tabbed interface, which allows a user to better focus on a single search. functionality into the faceted inte rface, allowing a user to switch between seeing all facets and a single facet, in an attempt to bring together the advantages of both interfaces. contracts FP6-027122-SALERO and FP6-027026-K-SPACE.
