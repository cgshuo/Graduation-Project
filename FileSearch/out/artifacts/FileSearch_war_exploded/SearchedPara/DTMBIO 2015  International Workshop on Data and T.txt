 Held each year in conjunction with one of the largest data management conferences, CIKM, the Ninth ACM International Workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics (DTMBIO  X 15) is organized to bring together researchers interested in development and application of cutting -edge data management and analysis methods with a specific focus on applications in biology and medicine . The purpose of DTMBIO is to foster discussions regardi ng the state -of-the -art applications of data and text mining on biomedical research problems . DTMBIO X  15 will help scientists understand emerging trends and opportunities in the evolving area of informatics related techniques and problems in the context of biomedical research. J.3 [ Life and Medical Sciences ]: Medical information systems Life and Medical Sciences, Bioinformatics, Health informatics, Data mining, Natural Language Processing, Algorithms, Experimentation . ACM proceedings, DTMBIO, biomedical text mining electronic biomedical data collection, biomedical researchers need to effectively manipulate data to yield research answers. The rapid development of medical and health informatics techniques is tightly c oupled with developments within several fields in computer science, including data and text mining, information retrieval, information extraction and database management systems, among others. A fundamental topic of research within medical and healthcare i nformatics is how to make effective use of the tremendous amount of biological and biomedical data to improve the understanding of biological systems. Such data include, but are not limited to, gene and protein sequences, gene expression profiles from m icr oarray experiments, protein -protein interactions from proteomic studies, genetic variants identified in genomic studies , clinical data such as might be collected in an electronic medical record, and information from the literature and other textual resourc es ranging from radiology reports and clinical narratives to social media . The need to extract, understand, integrate, and make use of information embedded in such heterogeneous data automatically effectively drives the current research in medical and heal th informatics . Acquiring the most useful information from this complex data and interpreting them in light of all the relevant prior knowledge remains a challenging task. The aim of the 201 5 workshop is to bring together researchers in the areas of data a nd text mining for biomedicine , who are interested in integrating and analyzing heterogeneous, structured and unstructured data.
 poster submissions, mostly from Korea and Australia, with one paper originating in th e UK . Each regular paper went through a rigorous double -blinded peer review by at least 3 members of the Program Committee. Based on the referee reports, the papers were ranked according to their reviews. T he program committee accepted 7 paper s which will be invited to a supplement issue of BMC Decision Making and Medical Informatics and 4 papers accepted for the workshop proceedings , of which only 1 is finally included . The papers , as well as the poster abstracts, cover a variety of topics, including relation extraction and knowledge discovery from the published biomedical literature, predictive methods for a number of different molecular interactions and biological characteristics, and issues relating to biomedical data integrity, including data duplicatio n and anonymization . We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers who are interested in app lying data and text m ining in biomedical applications . Accepted papers cover various research problems in biomedical informatics. Lin et al. [1] introduce a new privacy-preserving model for spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) that collects adverse drug events reports. Their results indicate that the SRSs records have characteristics that differ from regula r healthcare records such as rare events, multiple individual records, and mul ti-valued sensitive attributes. Kim et al. [2] propose a new prognostic marker to predict castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that is derived from the longitudinal biomar ker, prostate specific antigen (PSA). Keum et al. [3] introduce a pipeline for predicting the compound -target interaction of natural products , using sequence similarity of the target and structural similarity of the compound based on bipartite matching. Jung [4] proposes a method to compute the dissimilarity between two gene expression samples based on features that represent pathway activity patterns. Preiss and Stevenson [5] examine the contribution of word -sense -disambiguation toward narrowing down liter ature -based discovery. Verspoor et al. [6] evaluate the performance of the extended PKDE4J, a relation extracti on system, on the Variome corpus. Joe and Nam [7 ] propose a method to find individual genes which associate with worse survival rate in breast ca ncer samples in four different data sets. Chen et al. [8] evaluate the reproducibility on a different dataset of an algorithm developed for identifying duplicate records in biological databases. organized in conjunction with CIKM in 2006, and 2008-2014. We invite researchers and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds such as computer science, information system , information science, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and medical sciences . The main objective of the workshop will be to strengthen the cooperation within the growing community in biomedical data and text mining research , allowing lively exchange of ideas and foster ing of new collaborations.
