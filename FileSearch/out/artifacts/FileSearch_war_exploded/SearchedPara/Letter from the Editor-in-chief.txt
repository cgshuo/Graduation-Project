 Dear Readers, With this issue of Explorations, the role of Editor-In-Chie f has been fully transitioned with fascinating articles during her tenure, and it X  X  going to be a challenge to fill her shoes! Bing Liu, Osmar Za  X  X ane and I would like to thank Sunit a for her service to Explorations.
 We have two exciting special issues coming up. In June, Raymo nd Ng and Jian Pei are guest editors of a special issue on  X  X ealth Informatics X , an area where data mining can directly contribute towards making people X  X  lives better. In December, Daniel Keim will guest edit a special issue on  X  X isual Analytics X . We als o plan to initiate a new series on Research Centers, where the universities and rese arch labs that drive our field tell us about their vision and research.
 This Issue We start the issue with a new feature. We invited the KDD 2006 w orkshop chairs to se-lect the most interesting papers from their workshops for in clusion in Explorations. The first paper is from the Multimedia Data Mining workshop, the s econd from WebKDD, and the last two from the Utility-Based Data Mining workshop . Next, we have papers describing the 2006 KDD Cup competition, and the strategies used by the winners. We then have an article describing four Grand Challenges for da ta mining, from the KDD 2006 panel. We wrap up our coverage of the conference with wor kshop summaries, and end the issue with a paper on stream mining.
