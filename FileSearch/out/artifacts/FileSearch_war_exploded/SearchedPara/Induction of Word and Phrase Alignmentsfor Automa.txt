Current research in automatic single-document summarization is dominated by two effective, yet na  X   X ve approaches: summarization by sentence extraction and headline generation via bag-of-words models. While successful in some tasks, neither of these models is able to adequately capture the large set of linguistic devices utilized by humans when they produce summaries.
One possible explanation for the widespread use of these models is that good techniques have been developed to extract appropriate training data for them from existing document/abstract and document/ headline corpora. We believe that future progress in automatic summarization will be driven both by the development of more sophisticated, linguistically informed models, as well as a more effective leveraging of document/abstract corpora. In order to open the doors to simultaneously achieving both of these goals, we have developed techniques for automatically producing word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between documents and their human-written abstracts. These alignments make explicit the correspondences that exist in such docu-ment/abstract pairs and create a potentially rich data source from which complex summarization of humans to perform such alignments, and based on these analyses, we describe experiments for creating them automatically. Our model for the alignment task is based on an extension of the standard hidden Markov model and learns to create alignments in a completely unsupervised fashion. We describe our model in detail and present experimental results that show that our document, abstract pairs. 1. Introduction and Motivation 1.1 Motivation
We believe that future success in automatic document summarization will be made possible by the combination of complex, linguistically motivated models and effective leveraging of data. Current research in summarization makes a choice between these two: one either develops sophisticated, domain-specific models that are subsequently be trained on large amounts of data (in the form of corpora of document/extract or document/headline pairs). One reason for this is that currently available technologies are only able to extract very coarse and superficial information that is inadequate for training complex models. In this article, we propose a method to overcome this problem: automatically generating word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between documents and their human-written abstracts. 1 tively simple alignment between a document fragment and its corresponding abstract fragment from our corpus. 2 In this example, a single abstract sentence (shown along the top of the figure) corresponds to exactly two document sentences (shown along the bottom of the figure). If we are able to automatically generate such alignments, one can envision the development of models of summarization that take into account effects of word choice, phrasal and sentence reordering, and content selection. Such models could be simultaneously linguistically motivated and data-driven. Furthermore, such alignments are potentially useful for current-day summarization techniques, including sentence extraction, headline generation, and document compression.
 vations about the nature of the relationship between a document and its abstract, and hence about the alignment itself: need our model to be able to operate both at the word level and at the phrase level, we need it to be able to allow arbitrary reorderings, and we need it to be able to account for words on both the document and abstract side that have no direct correspondence. In this paper, we develop an alignment model that is capable of learning all these aspects of the alignment problem in a completely unsupervised fashion. 506 1.2 Shortcomings of Current Summarization Models
Current state-of-the-art automatic single-document summarization systems employ one of three techniques: sentence extraction, bag-of-words headline generation, or document compression. Sentence extraction systems take full sentences from a doc-ument and concatenate them to form a summary. Research in sentence extraction can be traced back to work in the mid 1950s and late 1960s by Luhn (1956) and
Edmundson (1969). Recent techniques are startlingly not terribly divergent from these original methods; see Mani and Maybury (1999); Marcu (2000); Mani (2001) for a com-prehensive overview. Headline generation systems, on the other hand, typically extract individual words from a document to produce a very short headline-style summary; see Banko, Mittal, and Witbrock (2000); Berger and Mittal (2000); Schwartz, Zajic, and
Dorr (2002) for representative examples. Between these two extremes, there has been a relatively modest amount of work in sentence simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Bangalore 1996; Mahesh 1997; Carroll et al. 1998; Grefenstette 1998; Jing 2000; Knight and Marcu 2002) and document compression (Daum  X  e III and Marcu 2002;
Daum  X  e III and Marcu 2004; Zajic, Dorr, and Schwartz 2004) in which words, phrases, and sentences are selected in an extraction process.
 shortcomings. Sentence extraction systems and document compression models make unrealistic assumptions about the summarization task (namely, that extraction is suffi-cient and that sentences are the appropriate level of granularity). Headline generation systems employ very weak models that make an incorrect bag-of-words assumption.
This assumption allows such systems to learn limited transformations to produce headlines from arbitrary documents, but such transformations are not nearly complex enough to adequately model anything beyond indicative summaries at a length of around 10 words. Bag-of-words models can learn what the most important words to keep in a headline are, but say nothing about how to structure them in a well-formed, grammatical headline.
 Daum  X  e III and Marcu 2004), both of which extend the sentence compression model of
Knight and Marcu (2002), we assume that sentences and documents can be summa-rized exclusively through deletion of contiguous text segments. In Knight and Marcu X  X  data, we found that from a corpus of 39, 060 abstract sentences, only 1, 067 were created from corresponding document sentences via deletion of contiguous segments. In other words, only 2 . 7% of the sentences in real document, abstract pairs can be explained by the model proposed by Knight and Marcu (2002). Such document compression models do not explain the rich set of linguistic devices employed, for example, in
Figure 1. 1.3 Prior Work on Alignments
In the sentence extraction community, there exists a wide variety of techniques for (essentially) creating alignments between document sentences and abstract sentences (Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen 1995; Teufel and Moens 1997; Marcu 1999); see also
Barzilay and Elhadad (2003); Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan (2004) for work describing alignments for the monolingual paraphrasing task. These techniques typically take into account information such as lexical overlap, synonymy, ordering, length, dis-course structure, and so forth. The sentence alignment problem is a comparatively simple problem to solve, and current approaches work quite well. Unfortunately, these traction systems.
 documents and headlines (Banko, Mittal, and Witbrock 2000; Berger and Mittal 2000;
Schwartz, Zajic, and Dorr 2002), based on IBM Model 1 (Brown et al. 1993). These models treat documents and headlines as simple bags of words and learn probabilistic word-based mappings between the words in the documents and the words in the headlines. Such mappings can be considered word-to-word alignments, but as our results show (see Section 5), these models are too weak for capturing the sophisticated operations that are employed by humans in summarizing texts.
 of summarization. The most relevant work is that of Jing (2002), in which a hidden
Markov alignment model is applied to the task of identifying word and phrase-level correspondences between documents and abstracts. Unfortunately, this model is only able to align words that are identical up to their stems, and thus suffers from a problem of recall. This also makes it ill-suited to the task of learning how to perform abstraction, in which one would desire to know how words get changed. For example, Jing X  X  model cannot identify any of the following alignments from Figure 1: ( Connecting Point
Connecting Point Systems ), (Mac  X  Macintosh), (retailer  X  Macintosh systems )and( January 1989  X  last January ).
 topic of research in the machine translation community. Based on these efforts, one might be initially tempted to use readily available alignment models developed in the context of machine translation, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003), to obtain word-level alignments in document, abstract corpora. However, as we will show (Section 5), the alignments produced by such a system are inadequate for the document, abstract alignment task. 1.4 Article Structure
In this article, we describe a novel, general model for automatically inducing word-and phrase-level alignments between documents and their human-written abstracts.
Beginning in Section 2, we will describe the results of human annotation of such align-ments. Based on this annotation, we will investigate the empirical linguistic properties of such alignments, including lexical transformations and movement. In Section 3, we will introduce the statistical model we use for deriving such alignments automatically.
The inference techniques are based on those of semi-Markov models, extensions of hidden Markov models that allow for multiple simultaneous observations.
 parameterizations we employ in Section 4. In particular, we discuss three distinct mod-els of movement, two of which are well-known in the machine translation alignment literature, and a third one that exploits syntax in a novel,  X  X ight X  manner. We also discuss several models of lexical rewriting, based on identities, stems, WordNet synonymy, and automatically induced lexical replacements. In Section 5, we present experimental results that confirm that our model is able to learn the hidden structure in our corpus of document, abstract pairs. We compare our model against well-known alignment models designed for machine translation as well as a state-of-the-art alignment model specifically designed for summarization (Jing 2002). Additionally, we discuss errors that the model currently makes, supported by some relevant examples and statistics. We conclude with some directions for future research (Section 6). 508 2. Human-produced Alignments
In order to decide how to design an alignment model and to judge the quality of the alignments produced by a system, we first need to create a set of  X  X old standard X  alignments. To this end, we asked two human annotators to manually construct such alignments between documents and their abstracts. These document, abstract pairs were drawn from the Ziff-Davis collection (Marcu 1999). Of the roughly 7, 000 documents in that corpus, we randomly selected 45 pairs for annotation. We added to this set of 45 pairs the 2,000 shorter documents from this collection, and all the work described in the remainder of this paper focuses on this subset of 2,033 document, abstract pairs. 3 Statistics for this sub-corpus and for the pairs selected for annotation are shown in Table 1. As can be simply computed from this table, the compression rate in this corpus is about 12%. The first five human-produced alignments were completed separately and then discussed; the last 40 were done independently. 2.1 Annotation Guidelines
Annotators were asked to perform word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between abstracts and documents, and to classify each alignment as either possible ( P ) or sure ( S ), where S  X  P , following the methodology used in the machine translation community (Och and Ney 2003). The direction of containment ( S a sure alignment is a stronger requirement than being a possible alignment. A full descrip-tion of the annotation guidelines is available in a document available with the alignment software on the first author X  X  web site (http:/ /www.isi.edu/ Here, we summarize the main points.
 in the summary to something . This was not always possible, as we will discuss shortly, but by and large it was an appropriate heuristic. The second major instruction was to choose alignments with maximal consecutive length: If there are two possible alignments for a phrase, the annotators were instructed to choose the one that will result in the longest consecutive alignment. For example, in Figure 1, this rule governs the choice of the alignment of the word Macintosh on the summary side: lexically, it could be aligned to the final occurrence of the word Macintosh on the document side, but by aligning it to
Apple Macintosh systems , we are able to achieve a longer consecutive sequence of aligned words.
 linguistic phenomena including punctuation, anaphora (for entities, annotators are told to feel free to align names to pronouns, for instance) and metonymy, null elements, genitives, appositives, and ellipsis. 2.2 Annotator Agreement
To compute annotator agreement, we employed the kappa statistic. To do so, we treat the problem as a sequence of binary decisions: given a single summary word and document word, should the two be aligned? To account for phrase-to-phrase align-ments, we first converted these into word-to-word alignments using the  X  X ll pairs X  heuristic. By looking at all such pairs, we wound up with 7 . 2 million items over which to compute the kappa statistic (with two annotators and two categories). Annotator agreement was strong for sure alignments and fairly weak for possible alignments.
When considering only sure alignments, the kappa statistic for agreement was 0 . 63 (though it dropped drastically to 0 . 42 on possible alignments).
 are often very difficult to align (despite the discussion of these issues in the alignment guidelines). The primary difficulty with function words is that when the summarizers lexical changes that are hard to predict. 4 Fortunately, for many summarization tasks, it is much more important to get content words right, rather than function words.
When words on a stop list of 58 function words and punctuation were ignored, the reflect very strong agreement and that kappa values between 0 . 60 and 0 . 80 reflect good agreement. 5 2.3 Results of Annotation After the completion of these alignments, we can investigate some of their properties.
Such an investigation is interesting both from the perspective of designing a model and from a linguistic perspective.
 aligned. This figure includes both standard lexical words and punctuation. Of this 16%, 4% are punctuation marks (though not all punctuation is unaligned) and 7% are function words. The remaining 5% are words that would typically be considered content words. This rather surprising result tells us that any model we build needs correspondence to any portion of the document. 510 computed that roughly 75% of the alignments produced by humans involve only one word on both sides. In 80% of the alignments, the summary side is a single word (thus in 5% of the cases, a single summary word is aligned to more than one document word). In 6 . 1% of the alignments, the summary side involved a phrase of length two, and in 2 . 2% of the cases it involved a phrase of length three. In all these numbers, care should be taken to note that the humans were instructed to produce phrase alignments only when word alignments were impossible. Thus, it is entirely likely that summary word i is aligned to document word j and summary word i + 1 is aligned to document word j + 1, in which case we count this as two singleton alignments, rather than an alignment of length two. These numbers suggest that looking at phrases in addition to words is empirically important.
 aligned summary words and phrases, the corresponding document word or phrase was exactly the same as that on the summary side in 51% of the cases. When this constraint was weakened to looking only at stems (for multi-word phrases, a match meant that each corresponding word matched up to stem), this number rose to 67%. When broken down into cases of singletons and non-singletons, we saw that 86% of singletons are identical up to stem, and 48% of phrases are identical up to stem. This suggests that looking at stems, rather than lexical items, is useful.
 consider the following question: Given that a summary phrase ending at position i is aligned to a document phrase ending at position j , what is a likely position in the document for the summary phrase beginning at position i + 1? It turns out that this is overwhelmingly j + 1. In Figure 2, we have plotted the frequencies of such relative jumps over the human-aligned data. This graph suggests that a model biased toward stepping forward monotonically in the document is likely to be appropriate. However, it should also be noted that backward jumps are also quite common, suggesting that a monotonic alignment model is inappropriate for this task. 3. Statistical Alignment Model
Based on linguistic observations from the previous section, we reach several conclu-sions regarding the development of a statistical model to produce such alignments.
First, the model should be able to produce alignments between phrases of arbitrary length (but perhaps with a bias toward single words). Second, it should not be con-strained by any assumptions of monotonicity or word (or stem) identity, but it might be able to realize that monotonicity and word and stem identity are good indicators of alignment. Third, our model must be able to account for words on the abstract side that have no correspondence on the document side (following the terminology from the machine translation community, we will refer to such words as null generated ). 3.1 Generative Story
Based on these observations, and with an eye toward computational tractability, we posit the following generative story for how a summary is produced, given a document: 1. Repeat until the whole summary is generated: 2. Jump to the end of the document.
 erative story with the option to jump to a specifically designated null state from which a summary phrase may be generated without any correspondence in the document. From inspection of the human-aligned data, most such null generated words are function words or punctuation; however, in some cases, there are pieces of information in the summary that truly did not exist in the original document. The null generated words can account for these as well (additionally, the null generated words allow the model to  X  X ive up X  when it cannot do anything better). We require that summary phrases produced from the null state have length 1, so that in order to generate multiple null generated words, they must be generated independently.
 to the alignment in Figure 1.
 the summary: the summary phrase is considered to be aligned to the document phrase 512 that  X  X enerated X  it. In order to make this computationally tractable, we must introduce some conditional independence assumptions. Specifically, we assume the following: 1. Decision (a) in our generative story depends only on the position of the 2. Decision (b) is conditionally independent of every other decision. 3. Decision (c) depends only on the phrase at the current document position. 3.2 Statistical Model
Based on the generative story and independence assumptions described above, we can model the entire summary generation process according to two distributions:
Section 4 to enable the focus here to be on the more general problems of inference and decoding in such a model. The model described by these independence assumptions very much resembles that of a hidden Markov model (HMM), where states in the state space are document ranges and emissions are summary words. The difference is that instead of generating a single word in each transition between states, an entire phrase is generated. This difference is captured by the semi-Markov model or segmental HMM framework, described in great detail by Ostendorf, Digalakis, and Kimball (1996); see also Ferguson (1980); Gales and Young (1993); Mitchell, Jamieson, and Harper (1995); Smyth, Heckerman, and Jordan (1997); Ge and Smyth (2000); Aydin, Altunbasak, and
Borodovsky (2004) for more detailed descriptions of these models as well as other ap-plications in speech processing and computational biology. In the following subsections, we will briefly discuss the aspects of inference that are relevant to our problem, but the interested reader is directed to Ostendorf, Digalakis, and Kimball (1996) for more details. 3.3 Creating the State Space
Given our generative story, we can construct a semi-HMM to calculate precisely the alignment probabilities specified by our model in an efficient manner. A semi-HMM is fully defined by a state space (with designated start and end states), an output alpha-bet, transition probabilities, and observation probabilities. The semi-HMM functions like an HMM: Beginning at the start state, stochastic transitions are made through the state space according to the transition probabilities. At each step, one or more observa-tions are generated. The machine stops when it reaches the end state.
 start , a unique final state end , and a state for each possible document phrase. That is, for a document of length n , for all 1  X  i  X  i  X  n , there is a state that corresponds to the document phrase beginning at position i and ending at position i , which we will refer to as r i , i . There is also a null state for each document position r { start , end } X  X  r i , i :1  X  i  X  i  X  n } X  X  r  X  , i :1  X  i of each word found in S , plus the end-of-sentence word  X  . We only allow the word  X  to be emitted on a transition to the end state. The transition probabilities are managed by the jump model, and the emission probabilities are managed by the rewrite model. the case when the corresponding summary is cd. Suppose the correct alignment is that cd is aligned to a and b is left unaligned. Then, the path taken through the semi-HMM is start  X  a  X  end . During the transition start
During the transition a  X  end ,  X  is emitted. 3.4 Expectation Maximization
The alignment task, as described above, is a chicken-and-egg problem: if we knew the model components (namely, the rewrite and jump tables), we would be able to would be able to estimate the model components. Unfortunately, we have neither.
Expectation maximization is a general technique for learning in such chicken-and-egg situations (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977; Boyles 1983; Wu 1983). The basic idea is to make a guess at the alignments, and then use this guess to estimate the parameters for the relevant distributions. We can use these re-estimated distributions to make a better guess at the alignments, and then use these (ideally better) alignments to re-estimate the parameters.
 514 a function by the expectation of the log of that function, through the use of Jensen X  X  inequality (Jensen 1906). The tightness of the bound means that when we attempt to estimate the model parameters, we may do so over expected alignments, rather than the true (but unknown) alignments. EM gives formal guarantees of convergence, but is only guaranteed to find local maxima. 3.5 Model Inference All the inference techniques utilized in this paper are standard applications of semi-
Markov model techniques. The relevant equations are summarized in Figure 5 and described here. In all these equations, the variables t and t range over phrases in the summary (specifically, the phrase s t : t ), and the variables i and j range over phrases in the document. The interested reader is directed to Ostendorf, Digalakis, and Kimball (1996) for more details on the generic form of these models and their inference techniques. summary pair is exponential in the length of the summary. This would make a na  X   X ve implementation of the computation of p ( s | d ) intractable without a more clever solu-tion. Instead, we are able to employ a variant of the forward algorithm to compute these probabilities recursively. The basic idea is to compute the probability of generating a prefix of the summary and ending up at a particular position in the document (this is known as the forward probability). Since our independence assumptions tell us that to compute the probability of taking one more step in the summary. At the end, the the summary and document simultaneously. The forward probabilities are calculated in the  X  table in Figure 5. This equation essentially says that the probability of emitting the first t  X  1 words of the summary and ending at position j in the document can be computed by summing over our previous position ( t ) and previous state ( i )and multiplying the probability of getting there (  X  i ( t + 1)) with the probability of moving from there to the current position.

Viterbi alignment. This alignment can be computed in exactly the same fashion as the forward algorithm, with two small changes. First, the forward probabilities implicitly with a max operator. Second, in order to recover the actual Viterbi alignment, we keep track of which previous state this max operator chose. This is computed by filling out the  X  table from Figure 5. This is almost identical to the computation of the forward probabilities, except that instead of summing over all possible t and i , we take the maximum over those variables.

HMMs, this is known as the Baum-Welch, Baum-Eagon or Forward-Backward algo-rithm (Baum and Petrie 1966; Baum and Eagon 1967). By introducing backward proba-bilities analogous to the forward probabilities, we can compute alignment probabilities of suffixes of the summary. The backward table is the analogous to the  X  table, except that the computation proceeds from the end to the start. pected number of times a particular alignment was made (the E-step in the EM frame-work). Based on these expectations, we can simply sum and normalize to get new parameters (the M-step). The expected transitions are computed according to the  X  table, which makes use of the forward and backward probabilities. Finally, the re-estimated jump probabilities are given by  X  a and the re-estimated rewrite probabilities are given by  X  b , which are essentially relative frequencies of the fractional counts given by the  X  s. estimation is O N 2 T 2 , where N is the length of the summary and T is the number of states (in our case, T is roughly the length of the document times the maximum phrase length allowed). However, we will typically bound the maximum length of a phrase; we are unlikely to otherwise encounter enough training data to get reasonable estimates of emission probabilities. If we enforce a maximum observation sequence length of l , our case, and the maximum out-degree of any node is b , then the complexity drops to
O ( NTbl ) . 4. Model Parameterization
Beyond the conditional independence assumptions made by the semi-HMM, there are nearly no additional constraints that are imposed on the parameterization (in terms of the jump and rewrite distributions) of the model. There is one additional technical requirement involving parameter re-estimation, which essentially says that the expec-tations calculated during the forward-backward algorithm must be sufficient statistics for the parameters of the jump and rewrite models. This constraint simply requires that whatever information we need to re-estimate their parameters is available to us from the forward-backward algorithm. 4.1 Parameterizing the Jump Model
Recall that the responsibility of the jump model is to compute probabilities of the form jump( j | j ), where j is a new position and j is an old position. We have explored several possible parameterizations of the jump table. The first simply computes a table of likely jump distances (i.e., jump forward 1, jump backward 3, etc.). The second models 516 this distribution as a Gaussian (though, based on Figure 2 this is perhaps not the best model). Both of these models have been explored in the machine translation commu-nity. Our third parameterization employs a novel syntax-aware jump model that at-tempts to take advantage of local syntactic information in computing jumps. 4.1.1 The Relative Jump Model. In the relative jump model, we keep a table of counts for each possible jump distance, and compute jump( j | j ) = jump ble jump type and its associated probability is shown in Table 2. By these calculations, regardless of document phrase lengths, transitioning forward between two consecutive r i , i , the value we use is a jump length of i . Thus, if we begin at the first word in the document, we incur a transition probability of j 1. There are no transitions into p .We additionally remember a specific transition jump rel (  X  ) for the probability of transition-estimations from the forward-backward algorithm. In particular, jump the relative frequency of length i jumps, and jump rel (  X  end in a null state to the total number of jumps. The null state remembers the position we ended in before we jumped there, and so to jump out of a null state, we make a jump based on this previous position. 6 4.1.2 Gaussian Jump Model. The Gaussian jump model attempts to alleviate the spar-sity of data problem in the relative jump model by assuming a parametric form to the jumps. In particular, we assume there is a mean jump length  X  and a jump variance  X  and then the probability of a jump of length i is given by: is defined over a continuous space. Thus, when we discretize the calculation, the nor-malizing constant changes slightly from that of a continuous normal distribution. In practice, we normalize by summing over a sufficiently large range of possible i s. The pa-rameters  X  and  X  2 are estimated by computing the mean jump length in the expectations and its empirical variance. We model null states identically to the relative jump model. 4.1.3 Syntax-Aware Jump Model. Both of the previously described jump models are extremely na  X   X ve in that they look only at the distance jumped and completely ignore what is being jumped over. In the syntax-aware jump model, we wish to enable the model to take advantage of syntactic knowledge in a very weak fashion. This is quite different from the various approaches to incorporating syntactic knowledge into ma-chine translation systems, wherein strong assumptions about the possible syntactic operations are made (Yamada and Knight 2001; Eisner 2003; Gildea 2003).
 tactic parse tree in Figure 6. Though it is not always the case, forward jumps of distance more than one are often indicative of skipped words. From the standpoint of the rela-tive jump models, jumping over the four words tripled it  X  X  sales and jumping over the four words of Apple Macintosh systems are exactly the same. would be much more willing to jump over the latter than the former. The latter phrase is a full syntactic constituent, while the first phrase is just a collection of nearby words.
Furthermore, the latter phrase is a prepositional phrase (and prepositional phrases might be more likely dropped than other phrases), while the former phrase includes a verb, a pronoun, a possessive marker, and a plain noun.
 according to the types of phrases being jumped over. That is, to jump over tripled it  X  X  sales would have probability jump syn ( VBDPRPPOSNNS ) while to jump over of Apple
Macintosh systems would have probability jump syn ( PP ). In order to compute the prob-abilities for jumps over many components, we factorize so that the first probabil-ity becomes jump syn ( VBD )jump syn ( PRP )jump syn ( POS )jump explicitly encodes our preference for jumping over single units rather than several syntactically unrelated units.
 corpus; we used Charniak X  X  parser (Charniak 1997). Given the document parse trees, the re-estimation of the components of this probability distribution is done by sim-ply counting what sorts of phrases are being jumped over. Again, we keep a single parameter jump syn (  X  ) for jumping to null states. To handle backward jumps, we simply consider a duplication of the tag set, where jump syn ( NP-f ) denotes a forward jump over an NP , and jump syn ( NP-b ) denotes a backward jump over an NP . 4.2 Parameterizing the Rewrite Model
As observed from the human-aligned summaries, a good rewrite model should be able to account for alignments between identical word and phrases, between words that 518 investigations of the data) also suggest that synonymy is an important factor to take into consideration in a successful rewrite model. We account for each of these four factors in four separate components of the model and then take a linear interpolation of them to produce the final probability: where the  X  s are constrained to sum to unity. The four rewrite distributions used are: id is a word identity model, which favors alignment of identical words; stem is a model designed to capture the notion that matches at the stem level are often sufficient for alignment (i.e., walk and walked are likely to be aligned); wn is a rewrite model based translation table in machine translation. These four models are described in detail in this section, followed by a description of how to compute their  X  sduringEM. 4.2.1 Word Identity Rewrite Model. The form of the word identity rewrite model is: and 0 when they differ. This model has no parameters. 4.2.2 Stem Identity Rewrite Model. The form of the stem identity rewrite model is very similar to that of the word identity model: match d up to stem (and are of the same length, i.e., | s normalization constant is computed offline based on a pre-computed vocabulary. This model also has no parameters. 4.2.3 WordNet Rewrite Model. In order to account for synonymy, we allow document phrases to be rewritten to semantically  X  X elated X  summary phrases. To compute the value for rewrite wn ( s | d ), we first require that both s and d can be found in WordNet. If the graph distance between their first senses is computed (we traverse the hyper-nymy tree up until they meet). If the two paths do not meet, then the probability is again taken to be zero. We place an exponential model on the hypernym tree-based distance: conditions is met. The single parameter of this model is  X  , which is computed according to the maximum likelihood criterion from the expectations during training. The nor-malization constant Z d is calculated by summing over the exponential distribution for all s that occur on the summary side of our corpus. 4.2.4 Lexical Rewrite Model. The lexical rewrite model is the  X  X atch all X  model to handle the cases not handled by the above models. It is analogous to a translation-table for the remainder of the article), and simply computes a matrix of (fractional) counts corresponding to all possible phrase pairs. Upon normalization, this matrix gives the rewrite distribution. 4.2.5 Estimation of the Weight Parameters. In order to weight the four models, we need to estimate values for the  X  components. This computation can be performed belonging to each of the models. We use these expectations to maximize the likelihood with respect to the  X  s and then normalize them so they sum to one. 4.3 Model Priors
In the standard HMM case, the learning task is simply one of parameter estimation, wherein the maximum likelihood criterion under which the parameters are typically trained performs well. However, in our model, we are, in a sense, simultaneously estimating parameters and selecting a model : The model selection is taking place at the level of deciding how to segment the observed summary. Unfortunately, in such model selection problems, likelihood increases monotonically with model complexity. Thus, model in which the entire summary is produced at once, and no generalization will be possible.
 appropriate. We advocate the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion in this case. While 520
ML optimizes the probability of the data given the parameters (the likelihood), MAP optimizes the product of the probability of the parameters with the likelihood (the unnormalized posterior). The difficulty in our model that makes ML estimation perform poorly is centered in the lexical rewrite model. Under ML estimation, we will simply insert an entry in the t-table for the entire summary for some uncommon or unique document word and are done. However, apriori we do not believe that such a parameter is likely. The question then becomes how to express this in a way that inference remains tractable.
 (technically, one multinomial for each possible document phrase). Under a multinomial distribution with parameter  X  with J -many components (with all  X  ming to one), the probability of an observation x is given by p ( x consider x to be a vector of length J in which all components are zero except for one, corresponding to the actual observation).
 gate distribution. Informally, two distributions are conjugate if you can multiply them together and get the original distribution back. In the case of the multinomial, the conju-gate distribution is the Dirichlet distribution. A Dirichlet distribution is parameterized byavector  X  of length J with  X  j  X  0, but not necessarily summing to one. The Dirichlet distribution can be used as a prior distribution over multinomial parameters and has density:
The fraction before the product is simply a normalization term that ensures that the integral over all possible  X  integrates to one.
 posterior of  X  given  X  and x , we arrive back at a Dirichlet distribution: p (  X  model, but a  X  X ake count X  of  X  j  X  1 has been added to component j . This means that if we are able to express our prior beliefs about the multinomial parameters found in the t-table in the form of a Dirichlet distribution, the computation of the MAP solution can be performed exactly as described before, but with the appropriate fake counts added to the observed variables (in our case, the observed variables are the alignments between a document phrase and a summary phrase). The application of
Dirichlet priors to standard HMMs has previously been considered in signal process-ing (Gauvain and Lee 1994). These fake counts act as a smoothing parameter, sim-ilar to Laplace smoothing (Laplace smoothing is the special case where  X  all j ).
 identity rewrites are worth 4 fake counts and that stem identity rewrites are worth 3 fake counts. Indeed, since a singleton alignment between identical words satisfies intuitive, but clearly arbitrary. However, this selection was not  X  X uned X  to the data to get better performance. As we will discuss later, inference in this model over the sizes of documents and summaries we consider is quite computationally expensive. As is appropriate, we specified this prior according to our prior beliefs, and left the rest to the inference mechanism. 4.4 Parameter Initialization
We initialize all the parameters uniformly, but in the case of the rewrite parameters, since there is a prior on them, they are effectively initialized to the maximum likelihood solution under their prior. 5. Experimental Results
The experiments we perform are on the same Ziff-Davis corpus described in the intro-duction. In order to judge the quality of the alignments produced, we compare them against the gold-standard references annotated by the humans. The standard precision and recall metrics used in information retrieval are modified slightly to deal with the sure and possible alignments created during the annotation process. Given the set S of sure alignments, the set S  X  P of possible alignments, and a set A of hypothesized alignments, we compute the precision as | A  X  P | / | A | phrases. That is, when given an abstract containing the man and a document also containing the man , a human will align the to the and man to man . However, a phrase-based model will almost always prefer to align the entire phrase the man to the man .This is because it results in fewer probabilities being multiplied together.
 alignments where ab is aligned to ab the same as ones in which a is aligned to a and b is aligned to b. Note, however, that this is not the same as a aligned to ab and b aligned to b . This latter alignment will, of course, incur a precision error. The soft precision metric induces a new, soft F-Score, labeled SoftF.
 of 58 function words and punctuation marks that appeared in the corpus (henceforth called the ignore-list ) was assembled. We computed precision and recall scores both on all words and on all words that do not appear in the ignore-list. 5.1 Systems Compared
Overall, we compare various parameter settings of our model against three other sys-tems. First, we compare against two alignment models developed in the context of machine translation. Second, we compare against the Cut and Paste model developed in the context of  X  X ummary decomposition X  by Jing (2002). Each of these systems will be discussed in more detail shortly. However, the machine translation alignment models assume sentence pairs as input. Moreover, even though the semi-Markov model is based on efficient dynamic programming techniques, it is still too inefficient to run on very long document, abstract pairs.
 down to an extract, abstract corpus, and then subsequently apply our models to this smaller corpus (see Figure 7). In our data, doing so does not introduce significant noise. To generate the extracts, we paired each abstract sentence with three sentences from the corresponding document, selected using the techniques described by Marcu (1999). In an informal evaluation, 20 such pairs were randomly extracted and evaluated by a human. Each pair was ranked as 0 (document sentences contain little to none of the information in the abstract sentence), 1 (document sentences contain some of the information in the abstract sentence) or 2 (document sentences contain all of the 522 information). Of the 20 random examples, none were labeled as 0; 5 were labeled as 1; and 15 were labeled as 2, giving a mean rating of 1 . 75. We refer to the resulting corpus as the extract, abstract corpus, statistics for which are shown in Table 3. Finally, for fair comparison, we also run the Cut and Paste model only on the extracts. 5.1.1 Machine Translation Models. We compare against several competing systems, the first of which is based on the original IBM Model 4 for machine translation (Brown et al. 1993) and the HMM machine translation alignment model (Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann 1996) as implemented in the GIZA++ package (Och and Ney 2003). otherwise made no changes. In all of these setups, 5 iterations of Model 1 were run, followed by five iterations of the HMM model. For Model 4, 5 iterations of Model 4 were subsequently run.
 when using a model from machine translation, it is unclear which of the summary and the document should be considered the source language and which should be considered the target language. By making the summary the source language, we are effectively requiring that the fertility of each summary word be very high, or that many words are null generated (since we must generate all of the document). By making the document the source language, we are forcing the model to make most document words have zero fertility. We have performed experiments in both directions, but the latter (document as source) performs better in general.
 is a good solution, we appended our corpus with sentence pairs consisting of one source word and one target word, which were identical. This is common practice in the ma-chine translation community when one wishes to cheaply encode knowledge from a dictionary into the alignment model. 5.1.2 Cut and Paste Model. We also tested alignments using the Cut and Paste sum-mary decomposition method (Jing 2002), based on a non-trainable HMM. Briefly, the Cut and Paste HMM searches for long contiguous blocks of words in the document and abstract that are identical (up to stem). The longest such sequences are aligned. By fixing a length cutoff of n and ignoring sequences of length less than n , one can arbitrarily increase the precision of this method. We found that n = 2 yields the best balance between precision and recall (and the highest F-measure).
On this task, this model drastically outperforms the machine translation models. 5.1.3 The Semi-Markov Model. While the semi-HMM is based on a dynamic pro-gramming algorithm, the effective search space in this model is enormous, even for moderately sized document, abstract pairs. The semi-HMM system was then trained on this extract, abstract corpus. We also restrict the state-space with a beam, sized at 50% of the unrestricted state-space. With this configuration, we run ten iterations of the forward-backward algorithm. The entire computation time takes approximately 8 days on a 128-node cluster computer.
 the relative movement jump table; the second, semi-HMM-Gaussian , uses the Gaussian parameterized jump table; the third, semi-HMM-syntax , uses the syntax-based jump model. 5.2 Evaluation Results
The results, in terms of precision, recall, and F-score, are shown in Table 4. The first three columns are when these three statistics are computed over all words. The next three columns are when these statistics are only computed over words that do not appear in our ignore list of 58 stop words. Under the methodology for combining the two human annotations by taking the union, either of the human scores would achieve a precision and recall of 1 . 0. To give a sense of how well humans actually perform on this task, we compare each human against the other.
 document sentences are the source language and the abstract sentences are the target language perform significantly better (comparatively). Since the MT models are not symmetric, going the bad way requires that many document words have zero fertility, which is difficult for these models to cope with. 524 since it is designed specifically for summarization. As one would expect, this method achieves higher precision than recall, though not by very much. The fact that the Cut and Paste model performs so well, compared to the MT models, which are able to learn non-identity correspondences, suggests that any successful model should be able to take advantage of both, as ours does.
 method, achieving a precision of 0 . 522 and a recall of 0 . 712, yielding an overall F-score of 0 . 606 when stop words are not considered. This is still below the human-against-human
F-score of 0 . 775 (especially considering that the true human-against-human scores are 1 . 0), but significantly better than any of the other models.
 best, followed by the relative jump model, with the Gaussian model coming in worst
Gaussian model does not perform well is not surprising; the data shown there is very non-Gaussian. A double-exponential model might be a better fit, but it is unlikely that such a model will outperform the syntax based model, so we did not perform this experiment. 5.3 Error Analysis The first mistake frequently made by our model is to not align summary words to null.
In effect, this means that our model of null-generated summary words is lacking. An example of this error is shown in Example 1 in Figure 8. In this example, the model has erroneously aligned from DOS in the abstract to from DOS in the document (the error is shown in bold). This alignment is wrong because the context of from DOS in the document is completely different from the context it appears in the summary. However, the identity rewrite model has overwhelmed the locality model and forced this incor-rect alignment. To measure the frequency of such errors, we have post-processed our system X  X  alignments so that whenever a human alignment contains a null-generated summary word, our model also predicts that this word is null-generated. Doing so will of the relative jump model, the precision jumps from 0 . 456 to 0 . 523 (F-score increases from 0 . 548 to 0 . 594) in the case of all words and from 0 . 512 to 0 . 559 (F-score increases from 0 . 593 to 0 . 624). This corresponds to a relative improvement of roughly 8% F-score. Increases in score for the syntax-based model are roughly the same.
 model too strongly. This problem has to do either with synonyms that do not appear frequently enough for the system to learn reliable rewrite probabilities, or with corefer-ence issues, in which the system chooses to align, for instance, Microsoft to Microsoft , rather than Microsoft to the company , as might be correct in context. As suggested aforementioned problem (to achieve an upper bound on performance), but we can provide some evidence. As mentioned before, in the human alignments, roughly 51% of all aligned phrases are lexically identical. In the alignments produced by our model (on the same documents), this number is 69%. In the case of stem identity, the hand-aligned data suggests that stem identity should hold in 67% of the cases; in our alignments, this number was 81%. An example of this sort of error is shown in Example 2 in
Figure 8. Here, the model has aligned The DMP 300 in the abstract to The DMP 300 in the document, while it should have been aligned to the printer due to locality constraints (note that the model also misses the ( produces  X  producing ) alignment, likely as a side-effect of it making the error depicted in bold).
 were randomly selected from a much longer list of errors). These examples are shown out of their contexts, but in most cases, the error is clear even so. In the first column, we show the summary phrase in question. In the second column, we show the document phrase to which it should be aligned, and in the third column, we show the document phrase that our model aligned it to (or null ). In the right column, we classify the model X  X  alignment as incorrect or partially correct .
 text, but the chosen occurrence of to port in the document is in the discussion of a completely different porting process than that referred to in the summary (and is 526 several sentences away). The seventh and tenth examples ( The new software and Oracle
Corp. , respectively) show instances of the coreference error that occurs commonly. 6. Conclusion and Discussion
Currently, summarization systems are limited to either using hand-annotated data or using weak alignment models at the granularity of sentences, which serve as suitable training data only for sentence extraction systems. To train more advanced extraction systems, such as those used in document compression models or in next-generation abstraction models, we need to better understand the lexical correspondences between documents and their human written abstracts. Our work is motivated by the desire to leverage the vast number of document, abstract pairs that are freely available on the
Internet and in other collections and to create word-and phrase-aligned document, abstract corpora automatically.
 pletely unsupervised manner. The model is based on an extension of a hidden Markov model, in which multiple emissions are made in the course of one transition. We have described efficient algorithms in this framework, all based on dynamic programming.
Using this framework, we have experimented with complex models of movement and lexical correspondences. Unlike the approaches used in machine translation, where only very simple models are used, we have shown how to efficiently and effectively leverage such disparate knowledge sources and WordNet, syntax trees, and identity models. ture of document, abstract pairs. Our system outperforms competing approaches, in-cluding the standard machine translation alignment models (Brown et al. 1993; Vogel,
Ney, and Tillmann 1996) and the state-of-the-art Cut and Paste summary alignment technique (Jing 2002).
 generated summary words and lexical identity. Within the model itself, we have already suggested two major sources of error in our alignment procedure. Clearly more work needs to be done to fix these problems. One approach that we believe will be particu-larly fruitful would be to add a fifth model to the linearly interpolated rewrite model based on lists of synonyms automatically extracted from large corpora. Additionally, investigating the possibility of including some sort of weak coreference knowledge into the model might serve to help with the second class of errors made by the model. computation time. In fact, we found that despite the efficient dynamic programming algorithms available for this model, the state space and output alphabet are simply so large and complex that we were forced to first map documents down to extracts before we could process them (and even so, computation took roughly 1,000 processor hours). Though we have not pursued it in this work, we do believe that there is room for improvement computationally, as well. One obvious first approach would be to run a simpler model for the first iteration (for example, Model 1 from machine translation (Brown et al. 1993), which tends to be very recall oriented ) and use this to see subsequent iterations of the more complex model. By doing so, one could recreate the extracts at each iteration using the previous iteration X  X  parameters to make better and shorter extracts. Similarly, one might only allow summary words to align to words found in their corresponding extract sentences, which would serve to significantly speed up training and, combined with the parameterized extracts, might not hurt performance.
A final option, but one that we do not advocate, would be to give up on phrases and train the model in a word-to-word fashion. This could be coupled with heuristic phrasal creation as is done in machine translation (Och and Ney 2000), but by doing this, one completely loses the probabilistic interpretation that makes this model so pleasing. lines of this model is to incorporate it into a full document summarization system. Since this can be done in many ways, including training extraction systems, compression systems, headline generation systems, and even extraction systems, we left this to
Nevertheless, the true usefulness of this model will be borne out by its application to true summarization tasks.
