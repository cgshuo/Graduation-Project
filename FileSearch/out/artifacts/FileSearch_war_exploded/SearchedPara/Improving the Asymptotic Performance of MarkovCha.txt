 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have gained enormous popularity over a wide variety dimensional probability distributions. An MCMC estimator can be based on any ergodic Markov chain with the distribution of interest as its stationary distribution. However, the choice of Markov chain greatly affects the performance of the estimator, in particular the accuracy achieved with a pre-specified number of samples [4].
 In general, the efficiency of an MCMC estimator is determined by two factors: i) how fast the its stationary distribution, how much the estimates fluctuate based on trajectories of finite length, which is characterized by the asymptotic variance. In this paper, we consider the latter criteria. Previous theory concerned with reducing asymptotic variance has followed two main tracks. The first focuses on reversible chains, and is mostly based on the theorems of Peskun [10] and Tierney [11], which state that if a reversible Markov chain is modified so that the probability of staying in the same state is reduced, then the asymptotic variance can be decreased. A number of methods have been proposed, particularly in the context of Metropolis-Hastings method, to encourage the Markov chain to move away from the current state, or its adjacency in the continuous case [12, 13]. The second track, which was explored just recently, studies non-reversible chains. Neal proved in [4] that starting from any finite-state reversible chain, the asymptotic variance of a related non-reversible chain, with reduced probability of back-tracking to the immediately previous state, will not increase, and typically decrease. Several methods have been proposed by Murray based on this idea [5]. Neal X  X  result suggests that non-reversible chains may be fundamentally better than reversible ones in terms of the asymptotic performance. In this paper, we follow up this idea by proposing a new way of converting reversible chains into non-reversible ones which, unlike in Neal X  X  method, are defined of the associated MCMC estimator is reduced. Our method is applicable to any non-reversible chain whose state transition graph contains loops, including those whose probability of staying in the same state is zero and thus cannot be improved using Peskun X  X  theorem. The method also admits graph of the original chain. Our result suggests a new and interesting direction for improving the asymptotic performance of MCMC.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 reviews some background concepts and results; section 3 presents the main theoretical results, together with the graphical interpretation; section 4 provides a simple yet illustrative example and explains the intuition behind the results; section 5 concludes the paper. Suppose we wish to estimate the expectation of some real valued function f over domain S , with respect to a probability distribution  X  , whose value may only be known to a multiplicative constant. Let A be a transition operator of an ergodic 1 Markov chain with stationary distribution  X  , i.e., where B is the reverse operator as defined in [5]. The expectation can then be estimated through the MCMC estimator where x 1 ,  X  X  X  , x T is a trajectory sampled from the Markov chain. The asymptotic variance of  X  T , with respect to transition operator A and function f is defined as ing the central limit theorem, and does not depend on the distribution of the initial point. Roughly speaking, asymptotic variance has the meaning that the mean square error of the estimates based on of  X  X urn in X  such that the chain is close enough to its stationary distribution. Asymptotic variance can be used to compare the asymptotic performance of MCMC estimators based on different chains with the same stationary distribution, where smaller asymptotic variance indicates that, asymptoti-cally, the MCMC estimator requires fewer samples to reach a specified accuracy.
 Under the ergodic assumption, the asymptotic variance can be written as where operator B , and  X  2 A ( f ) =  X  2 B ( f ) since A is also the reverse operator of B by definition. asymptotic variance can thus be written as with Q = diag {  X  } . Since B is the reverse operator of A , QA = B &gt; Q . Also, from the ergodic assumption, can be represented by Kenney X  X  formula [7] in the non-reversible case: being the joint distribution of two consecutive states. It is clear from Eq.5 that the transition operator A affects the asymptotic variance only through term [ X  comparing the asymptotic variance of two MCMC estimators becomes a matter of comparing their Peskun X  X  theorem in the discrete case [3].
 In the case where the Markov chain is non-reversible, i.e., J is asymmetric, the analysis becomes much more complicated. We start by providing a sufficient and necessary condition in section 3.1, which transforms the comparison of asymptotic variance based on arbitrary finite Markov chains into a matrix ordering problem, using a result from matrix analysis. In section 3.2, a special case is identified, in which the asymptotic variance of a reversible chain is compared to that of a non-reversible one whose joint distribution over consecutive states is that of the reversible chain plus a skew-Hermitian matrix. We prove that the resulting non-reversible chain has smaller asymptotic variance, and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such non-zero skew-Hermitian matrices. Finally in section 3.3, we provide a graphical interpretation of the result. 3.1 The general case From Eq.5 we know that comparing the asymptotic variances of two MCMC estimators is equivalent symmetric and asymmetric parts of  X  .
 skew Hermitian part of X .
 From Lemma 1, it follows immediately that in the discrete case, the comparison of MCMC esti-mators based on two Markov chains with the same stationary distribution can be cast as a different problem of matrix comparison, as stated in the following proposition.
 Proposition 1 Let A , A 0 be two transition operators of ergodic Markov chains with stationary dis-three conditions are equivalent: 1)  X  2 A ( f )  X   X  2 A 0 ( f ) for any f 2) [ X   X  ] H h ( X  0 )  X  i Proof. First we show that  X  is invertible. Following the steps in [3], for any f 6 = 0 , thus [ X ] H 0 , and  X  is invertible since  X  f 6 = 0 for any f 6 = 0 .
 Condition 1) and 2) are equivalent by definition. We now prove 2) is equivalent to 3). By Lemma 1, the result follows by noticing that [ X ] H = Q +  X  X  &gt;  X  [ J ] H and [ X ] S =  X  [ J ] S . 3.2 A special case Generally speaking, the conditions in Proposition 1 are very hard to verify, particularly because of This amounts to the case where the second chain is reversible, and its transition operator is the formalized in the following corollary.
 Corollary 1 Let T be a reversible transition operator of a Markov chain with stationary distribution  X  . Assume there is some H that satisfies Condition I. 1 &gt; H = 0 , H 1 = 0 , H =  X  H &gt; , and 3 Condition II. T  X  Q  X  H are valid transition matrices.
 Denote A = T + Q  X  H , B = T  X  Q  X  H , then 1) A preserves  X  , and B is the reverse operator of A . 2)  X  2 A ( f ) =  X  2 B ( f )  X   X  2 T ( f ) for any f . 3) If H 6 = 0 , then there is some f , such that  X  2 A ( f ) &lt;  X  2 T ( f ) . 4) If A  X  = T + (1 +  X  ) Q  X  H is valid transition matrix,  X  &gt; 0 , then  X  2 A Proof. For 1), notice that  X  &gt; T =  X  &gt; , so and similarly for B . Moreover thus B is the reverse operator of A .
 For 2),  X  2 A ( f ) =  X  2 B ( f ) follows from Eq.5. Let J 0 = QT , J = QA . Note that [ J ] S = H , For 3), write X = [ X ] H , Thus Since H 6 = 0 , there is at least one s  X  , such that He s  X  6 = 0 . Let f = Q  X  XHe s  X  , then For 4), let  X   X  = Q +  X  X  &gt;  X  QA  X  , then for  X  &gt; 0 , by Eq.5, we have  X  2 A Corollary 1 shows that starting from a reversible Markov chain, as long as one can find a non-zero H satisfying Conditions I and II, then the asymptotic performance of the MCMC estimator is guaranteed to improve. The next question to ask is whether such an H exists, and, if so, how to find one. We answer this question by first looking at Condition I. The following proposition shows that any H satisfying this condition can be constructed systematically.
 Proposition 2 Let H be an S -by-S matrix. H satisfies Condition I if and only if H can be written as the linear combination of 1 2 ( S  X  1) ( S  X  2) matrices, with each matrix of the form Here u 1 ,  X  X  X  , u S  X  1 are S  X  1 non-zero linearly independent vectors satisfying u &gt; s 1 = 0 . Proof. Sufficiency. It is straightforward to verify that each U i,j is skew-Hermitian and satisfies U i,j 1 = 0 . Such properties are inherited by any linear combination of U i,j .
 Necessity. We show that there are at most 1 2 ( S  X  1) ( S  X  2) linearly independent bases for all H such that H =  X  H &gt; and H 1 = 0 . On one hand, any S -by-S skew-Hermitian matrix can be written as the linear combination of 1 2 S ( S  X  1) matrices of the form where  X  is the standard delta function such that  X  ( i, j ) = 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. However, the constraint H 1 = 0 imposes S  X  1 linearly independent constraints, which means that out of
S ( S  X  1) parameters, only are independent.
 On the other hand, selecting two non-identical vectors from u 1 ,  X  X  X  , u S  X  1 results in Assume particular u s , u from u 1 ,  X  X  X  , u S  X  1 through Gram X  X chmidt orthogonalization, and create a different set of bases  X  U i,j . It is easy to verify that each independent, it follows that U i,j must also be linearly independent.
 Proposition 2 confirms the existence of non-zero H satisfying Condition I. We now move to Condi-tion II, which requires that both QT + H and QT  X  H remain valid joint distribution matrices, i.e. all entries must be non-negative and sum up to 1 . Since 1 &gt; ( QT + H ) 1 = 1 by Condition I, only the non-negative constraint needs to be considered.
 It turns out that not all reversible Markov chains admit a non-zero H satisfying both Condition I and II. For example, consider a Markov chain with only two states. It is impossible to find a non-zero skew-Hermitian H such that H 1 = 0 , because all 2-by-2 skew-Hermitian matrices are proportional to " 0  X  1 The next proposition gives the sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a non-zero H satisfying both I and II. In particular, it shows an interesting link between the existence of such H and the connectivity of the states in the reversible chain.
 Proposition 3 Assume a reversible ergodic Markov chain with transition matrix T and let J = QT . I and II, if and only if there is a loop in G T .
 Proof. Sufficiency: Without loss of generality, assume the loop is made of states 1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  , N and all 1  X  n  X  N  X  1 . A non-zero H can then be constructed as Here and H 1 = 0 .
 following the ergodic assumption. In other word, there are exactly 2 ( S  X  1) non-zero off-diagonal elements in J . Plus, these 2 ( S  X  1) elements are arranged symmetrically along the diagonal and spanning every column and row of J .
 respectively, with p s,s  X  0 and p s,s 0 &gt; 0 , and all other entries being 0 .
 Assume that one wants to construct a some H , such that J  X  H  X  0 . Let h s be the s -th row of H . row, thus the s -th column of H must be 0 .
 Having set the s -th column and row of H to 0 , one can consider the reduced Markov chain with one rows and columns in H must be 0 .
 The indication of Proposition 3 together with 2 is that all reversible chains can be improved in terms of asymptotic variance using Corollary 1, except those whose transition graphs are trees. In practice, the non-tree constraint is not a problem because almost all current methods of constructing reversible chains generate chains with loops. 3.3 Graphical interpretation In this subsection we provide a graphical interpretation of the results in the previous sections. Starting from a simple case, consider a reversible Markov chain with three states forming a loop. u 1 1 = u graph of a reversible Markov chain with S = 9 states, with a vortex 3  X  8  X  6  X  5  X  4 of strength  X  inserted. The corresponding H can be expressed as the linear combination of U i,j , as shown on the right hand side of the graph. We start from the vortex 8  X  6  X  9  X  8 , and add one vortex a time. The dotted lines correspond to edges on which the flows cancel out when a new vortex is added. For example, when vortex 6  X  5  X  9  X  6 is added, edge 9  X  6 cancels edge 6  X  9 in the previous vortex, resulting in a larger vortex with four states. Note that in this way one can construct vortices which do not include state 9 , although each U i,j is a vortex involving 9 . probability of jumps 1  X  2 , 2  X  3 , and 3  X  1 is increased, and the probability of jumps in the opposite direction is decreased. Intuitively, this amounts to adding a  X  X ortex X  of direction 1  X  2  X  which adds a vortex in the opposite direction. This simple case also gives an explanation of why adding or subtracting non-zero H can only be done where a loop already exists, since the operation requires subtracting  X  from all entries in J corresponding to edges in the loop.
 In the general case, define S  X  1 vectors u 1 ,  X  X  X  , u S  X  1 as S  X  i , and any vortex of N states ( N  X  3 ) s 1  X  s 2  X  X  X  X  X  X  s N  X  s 1 can be represented by the Figure 1. Therefore, adding or subtracting an H to J is equivalent to inserting a number of vortices into the state transition map. Adding vortices to the state transition graph forces the Markov chain to move in loops following pre-specified directions. The benefit of this can be illustrated in the following example. Consider a reversible Markov chain with S states forming a ring, namely from state s one can only jump to s  X  1 or s 1 , with  X  and being the mod-S summation and subtraction. The only possible non-zero H in this example is of form  X  P S  X  1 s =1 U s,s +1 , corresponding to vortices on the large ring. We assume uniform stationary distribution  X  ( s ) = 1 S . In this case, any reversible chain behaves like a random walk. The chain which achieves minimal asymptotic variance is the one with the probability of both jumping forward and backward being 1 2 . The expected number of steps for Figure 2: Demonstration of the vortex effect: (a) and (b) show two different, reversible Markov chains, each containing 128 states connected in a ring. The equilibrium distribution of the chains is depicted by the gray inner circles; darker shades correspond to higher probability. The equilibrium the chains are constructed such that the probability of staying in the same state is zero. In each case, two trajectories, of length 1000 , are generated from the chain with and without the vortex, starting from the state pointed to by the arrow. The length of the bar radiating out from a given state represents the relative frequency of visits to that state, with red and blue bars corresponding to chains with and without vortex, respectively. It is clear from the graph that trajectories sampled and the trajectory in (b) does not escape from the current peak. On the other hand, with vortices added, trajectories of the same length spread over all the states, and effectively explore both peaks by variance) between two states  X  time steps apart, with  X  ranging from 1 to 600 . Here we take the Markov chains from (b) and use function f ( s ) = cos 4  X   X  s 128 . When vortices are added, not only do the absolute values of the correlations go down significantly, but also their signs alternate, indicating that these correlations tend to cancel out in the sum of Eq.5. reducing asymptotic variance to zero. Also note that the reversible chain here has zero probability of staying in the current state, thus cannot be further improved using Peskun X  X  theorem. Our intuition about why adding vortices helps is that chains with vortices move faster than the reversible ones, making the function values of the trajectories less correlated. This effect is demon-strated in Figure 2. In this paper, we have presented a new way of converting a reversible finite Markov chain into a non-reversible one, with the theoretical guarantee that the asymptotic variance of the MCMC estimator based on the non-reversible chain is reduced. The method is applicable to any reversible chain whose states are not connected through a tree, and can be interpreted graphically as inserting vortices into the state transition graph.
 The results confirm that non-reversible chains are fundamentally better than reversible ones. The general framework of Proposition 1 suggests further improvements of MCMC X  X  asymptotic per-formance, by applying other results from matrix analysis to asymptotic variance reduction. The combined results of Corollary 1, and Propositions 2 and 3, provide a specific way of doing so, and pose interesting research questions. Which combinations of vortices yield optimal improvements for a given chain? Finding one of them is a combinatorial optimization problem. How can a good combination be constructed in practice, using limited history and computational resources? References [1] R.P.
