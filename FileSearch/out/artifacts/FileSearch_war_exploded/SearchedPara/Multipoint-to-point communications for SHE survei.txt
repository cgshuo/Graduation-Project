 1. Introduction
Due to the tremendous growth of Internet users and technol-ogy advances in both computing devices and wire/wireless net-works, ubiquitous Internet services have been pervasive over the heterogeneous computing environments. Users are expected to be able to access the services anytime and anywhere on any comput-ing devices. According to the marketing report of YANO Research (2009) , the world market for the major brand-name surveillance cameras sharply increased from 4750 thousand units in 2005 to 7200 thousand units in 2008, and the researcher forecast the market size will grow to 8250 thousand units in 2012. This report explicitly indicates that more and more video surveillance systems are needed to protect lives and assets of individuals, enterprises and governments, and then the demand of UVS over Internet to integrate video surveillance systems with heterogeneity to foster more intelligent video surveillance applications in diversity will grow up in few years. As a result, cost-effective UVS system cameras installed on the city streets nearby our house. Automatic alarms/acknowledgements of intruder tracking systems are pro-vided by multimedia intelligent surveillance (MIS) service on image/video intelligent processing (IIP/VIP) units to detect and track the intruders. However, the advantage from MA tunneling becomes limited and brings the same loading overhead as unicast transmission once those SRs located in different multicast islands with the CP X  X . Moreover, bandwidth requirement is also critical for the other types of surveillance services of single service on single camera (SSSC), single service on multiple cameras (SSMC), and multiple services on single camera (MSSC), to not only achieve high quality surveillance video transmission, but also guarantee the high quality surveillance video content for improv-ing the accuracy of event detection and alarm. With the above considerations, we deliberated the load sharing problem in UVS from the point of view of transport-layer protocol and led the idea of bandwidth aggregation into UVS architecture. A prioritized
R 2 CP (P-R 2 CP) is proposed to fit the characteristics of video transmission to reach a great perceptual quality and much suitable for surveillance video transportation in SHE. for improving the weakness of UVS architecture. The idea of P2P has revolutionized the conventional client-server architecture to a multipoint-to-point (MPP) style for video data delivery over heterogeneous Internet and allows peers to communicate and share data with each other. P2P also features the distribution of networking flows, error tolerance and cost-effectively use of resources and prevention of overloading on centralized streaming servers. Meanwhile, most of the current computing devices including mobile hosts (e.g., smart phones and notebooks) are equipped with multiple network interfaces to connect to different networks. However, while applying transport protocol to P2P video streaming services, the prevalent application-layer protocol
RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) is not applicable to coordinate alone with MPP data flows in heterogeneous networks over
Internet. Recently, the transport-layer receiver-driven R 2 CP (Radial Reception Control Protocol) and its companion RCP (Reception Control Protocol) have been proposed to achieve
MPP video communications over heterogeneous Internet ( Hsieh et al., 2003 ; Hsieh and Sivakumar, 2004 ). R 2 CP can effectively of the proposed P-R 2 CP architecture are pres ented, includes the software architecture, priority-b ased scheduling m echanism, proto-col operations and how we measure the quality. Section 4 shows the performance results of quality of P-R 2 CP from experiments. Conclu-sions are presented in the final section. 2. Previous work of R 2 CP
Conventional TCP is a sender-driven, reliable and in-order delivery protocol. However, in real-time video streaming over inconstant Internet, the traffic-friendly reliability of packet retransmissions preserved in TCP congestion control will rather reduce transmission performance of the video packets with strict requirement of timely delivery from a server to client. Thus, R 2 CP was proposed to apply the idea of P2P network to share the video streaming loading with different peers without a centralized server in bottleneck. The companion protocol RCP of R 2 CP is designed to handle the reliable packet delivery like TCP from each peer to client and R 2 CP aggregates the bandwidth from each peer link for the MPP video streaming.

RCP applies most of the TCP transmission mechanisms, such as congestion window-based control mechanism, say, the binomial streaming-friendly congestion control, flow control and reliabil-ity. The main difference between TCP and RCP is RCP reverses the driving direction of TCP transmission, that is, from sender-driven to receiver-driven. In receiver-driven RCP, the sender only responds to transmit data according to receiver X  X  requests and benefits from smarter transport layer mechanisms of congestion control, loss recovery and power management for nomadic users (i.e., RCP receiver) in wireless network. When the receiver detects a data packet that cannot be received in time, the packet will directly be dropped. The retransmission mechanism will be ignored to avoid the degradation of the transmission performance of real-time video streaming applications.

In P2P network ( Yang and Vecianan, 2006 ; Cohen, 2003 ), the communication topology is not fixed all the time. Similar to wireless ad hoc network, each peer node has a different online and offline time. The receiver should actively send a request to a peer when certain data or portion of a file is needed. As a result, the P2P network is more suitable to apply receiver-driven trans-port protocols like RCP for each peer link in constantly changing network topologies. However, RCP itself does not consider MPP connections preserved in P2P network with inherence of load sharing for senders. When the differences (in bandwidth, delay and loss rate) among multiple paths are significant, how to effectively perform multipoint-to-point transmission for real-time video streaming is really a challenge. 3. Prioritized R 2 CP
The R 2 CP with RCP has been introduced above. However, R 2 CP is not efficient enough for bandwidth-hunger applications, espe-cially for multimedia applications. Thus, we lead the idea of priority and considered the characteristic of video transmission to the R 2 CP to improve QoS/QoE for SHE surveillance. By con-sidering the compression method of video surveillance, usually MPEG standard, there are three types of frames, I-, P-and B-frame. I-frames are referenced by P-and B-frames. P-frames are referenced by B-frames. In general, once an I-frame is lost, error-propagation will be occurred in P-and B-frame and decrease the playback quality before the next I-frame is received. As a result, we first apply the packet scheduling mechanism into R
CP by considering the importance of these three types of frames from high to low: I-, P-, B-frames.
 (4) p_active: While there is no available space in recv_buffer for (5) p_class: This structure is related to p_pending structure and (6) p_loss: Once a packet cannot be arrived in time, we treat the 3.2. Priority-based packet scheduling with forward error avoidance policy
In order to couple packet scheduling with priority character-istic, receiver should realize the type and importance of each packet. The importance of each packet directly reflects the influences of playback quality, that is, the QoE for users. Thus, on one hand, we need to make sure the packets should be arrived in sequence; on the other hand, to increase the reception prob-ability of packets whose priority is higher than others. For this purpose, we extend P-R 2 CP by using forward error avoidance (FEA) policy to prioritize the scheduled request packets.
There is a rank formula proposed in R 2 CP to calculate the next requested packet that will be arrived in sequence. The main idea of FEA is to extend the rank formula to detect if there exists one or more packets of the following requests will not be received in time. Once some of the following requested packets are essential to the playback quality and cannot be received in time, other requests of packets with less importance should be dropped earlier to decrease the playback quality degradation from error-propagation. The number of following requests which FEA applied in P-R 2 CP engine to detect is defined as FEA distance. Fig. 4 shows an example of the FEA policy applied on single RCP session with the FEA distance value of 3. Meanwhile, at time stamp T1, P-R 2 CP engine calculates the next 3 packet numbers and their expected arrival time. Once P-R 2 CP engine detects an important packet with sequence number 9 cannot be received in time, the request packet in candidate with sequence number 1 will be dropped and replaced by the more important packet with sequence number 4. The rankFEA formula and the expected arrival time of ExpArrTime are defined in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. rankFEA  X  packet with sequence number 10. The following two requests through RCP 1 and RCP 2 will be specified to request the important packet first, with sequence number 7 and 8, respectively. The playback quality influence is shown in Fig. 5 (b). Since there are two packets lost in both scheduling mechanisms, the loss of
I-frame will cause error propagation to influence the following P-and B-frames. Therefore, as compared with Fig. 2 (b), P-R 2 CP will make a better playback quality than R 2 CP.

Chatterjee, 2011 ), Table 1 shows a comparison between R 2 CP and P-R 2 CP. For the availability requirement, users want a stable and reliable playback quality while accessing a multimedia ser-vice. Since RCP is a TCP like transportation protocol, multimedia packets are ensured to be received at the receiver. However, this characteristic often makes the packets be late to the receiver and breaks off the playback. P-R 2 CP takes the multimedia playback less PSNR jitter than R 2 CP. For the loss requirement, users experience is usually affected by loss. This requirement can be simply divided into two points of views, network loss and frame loss. At the point of view of network loss, this requirement can be easily achieved by the application layer mechanisms, e.g., FEC (Forward Error Correction). From the point of view of frame loss, if the packets cannot be received before playback, the frame is regarded as a frame loss even the frame packet is received later. Based on the priority function, P-R 2 CP has the ability to ensure the frame packets can be received in time and comes less loss frames than R 2 CP. For the interactivity requirement, different users may use different devices to access the multimedia services through different mediums and hope a smoothly playback. Layer-coding mechanism is a good way to achieve the requirement. As the design of P-R2CP, we can easily apply layer-coding mechanisms to, dynamically or manually, adjust the playback quality based on users X  currently bandwidth. By combining the above requirements, Media Quality requirement comes to the most important QoE requirement. Users want to look distortion-free, high PSNR, low PSNR jitter and as high quality as possible playouts. By summar-izing the above discussion, P-R 2 CP brings a better QoE than R 2 CP.
Secure transmission is a kind of QoE requirement that users may be concerned, especially while fo rwarding sensitive or valuable surveillance images over the intern et. On the perspective of security, there are three concepts, confidentiality, integrity and availability, to protect the forwarded information. Fortunately, many advanced security mechanisms ( Bellare et al., 2000 ; Eloff and Eloff, 2005 ; Lai and Wang, 2006 ; Lochter and Merkle, 2010 ; Wang and Liu, 2011 ; Aly and Mostafa, 2010 ) are proposed. We can easily apply these security mechanisms into P-R 2 CP to secure the proposed protocol. For example, Diffie X  X ellman (DH) key exchange process is also applied not only to distribute the pre-shared key between the sender and receiver, but also to increase the security by periodically changing the encryption or decryption key. While the RCP session is established, we can first negotiate the encryption and decryption key through DH for the following encryption mechanism. The protection level can be dynamically adjusted according to the instant network quality and the i mportance of transmitted frame. 3.4. Quality measurement metrics
From the point of view of user experience and reliability of surveillance recognition system, how much and how often does the surveillance quality decrease should be seriously treated. In this paper, we are going to discuss the protocol performance by measuring how many frames with distortion/error propagation.
Since different player or codec implementation will cause different situation to make streaming freeze, we assume that the streaming freeze only occurs when I-frame lost. Loss of other frames will only come out error propagation or image distortion. Moreover, since B-frame will reference I-and P-frame and P-frame will reference I-frame, let the lost of a B-frame denoted as F . The loss of a P-frame makes ( r  X  1) F distortion frames, where r represents the number of referenced B-frame. In the same way, the lost of a I-frame makes q ( r  X  1) F  X  ( r  X  1) F  X  F distortion frames, where q represents the number of referenced P-frame. Thus, total distortion frames during a period of time can be modeled by Eq. (3).
 T 4. Experimental results
In this section, the performance improvement will be discussed by applying the proposed P-R 2 CP into UVS. decreased playback quality is acceptable? We found that loss of
I-frame brings the worst playback quality, followed by P-frame, and the loss of the B-frame affect the playback quality the least.
As a result, the idea of P-R 2 CP that prioritizes the streaming packets based on frame type of the packet can be proved reasonable.
 and the receiver requested one surveillance video from these 5 sources. Three surveillance video clips are requested by the receiver. The testing parameters of these 5 source peers are listed in Table 2 . Since the throughput and loss rate are variable, the simulation constructed these two parameters with average throughput and loss rate.
 Eq. (2), which has also been adopted by Wu et al. (2001) . different video clips. The results reveal that, by dropping packets of low importance in advance, P-R 2 CP can effectively transmit high priority packets. Thus, the prop osed method can provide a higher multipoint-to-point video streaming quality than the conventional R 2 CP under the same condition of network congestion.
P-R 2 CP with different FEA distance for SV_2. By increasing FEA distance, we could anticipate whether a packet will be arrived late and effect the playback earlier and earlier. The result shows 74.4% total distortion improvement while we look the next three packets and do FEA for each transmission. An interesting observa-tion is the total distortion does not continuously decrease while
FEA distance is getting lager. That is because the larger FEA distance we take, the more calculation of rankFEA and search from p_rank structure will be processed, to bring the counter-effect. Moreover, the variable bit-rate streaming also effects the total distortion. Since a fast move scene may bring a high data rate, some packets need to be dropped to achieve smoothly playback.
 ing phenomenon proposed by Tsao and Sivakumar (2009) ,as there is an order of magnitude difference between heterogeneous network interfaces, it may not be beneficial to utilize all the interfaces at the same time, especially considering that their link characteristics (bandwidth, delay, loss rate, dynamics) are dis-tinct. Besides, Wang et al. (2011) also measured that the aggrega-tion of several links with distinct bandwidth only came out a limited aggregated throughput without packet loss and end-to-end delays in each link. The above measurements are mainly caused by the receive buffer blocking, said, head of line (HOL) the receiving buffer. Thus, P-R2CP can cost-effectively minimize the HOL problem for bandwidth aggregation among heteroge-neous networks over the prevalent Internet to further provide SHE video surveillance with enhanced QoE and QoS. 5. Conclusion
The application technologies from SHE provide more and more automatic services such as surveillance-video-based abnormal behavior detection, abrupt incursion detection, and etc. Thus, the bandwidth-hunger applications of SHE can take advantage of the MPP connections to aggregate more bandwidth to gain user-perceived QoE and QoS. The receiver-centric transport-layer R 2 CP emerged to resolve the incapability of the MPP communication in conventional TCP and UDP. However, our study observed the drawback of R 2 CP, which randomly drops packets while in limited bandwidth or congestion situation. Obviously, this drawback affects a lot for video playback quality and brings an issue for critical data packets that may be dropped in great risk of network congestion for future media Internet. In this paper, we proposed a P-R 2 CP to effectively decrease the loss ratio of critical data packets in MPP video streaming while the network is congested. It benefits from the property of considering both the receiver-driven characteristics and packet types of media content. Besides, an example on MPP-UVS is also proposed for SHE to apply the proposed P-R 2 CP scheme. Experimental results not only demon-strate that the idea of P-R 2 CP is feasible but also revealed that P-R 2 CP can provide better quality of service in MPP surveillance video streaming for SHE under the same condition of congestion than original R 2 CP.
