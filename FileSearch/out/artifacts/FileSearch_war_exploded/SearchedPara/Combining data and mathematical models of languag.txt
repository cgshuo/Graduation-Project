 The fascinating phenomena of language evolution and language change have inspired much work from computational perspectives in recent years. Research in this field considers populations of lin-guistic agents, and asks how the population dy-namics are related to the behavior of individual agents. However, most such work makes little contact with empirical data (de Boer and Zuidema, 2009). 1 As pointed out by Choudhury (2007), most computational work on language change deals with data from cases of change either not at all, or at a relatively high level. 2
Recent computational work has addressed  X  X eal world X  data from change in several languages (Mitchener, 2005; Choudhury et al., 2006; Choud-hury et al., 2007; Pearl and Weinberg, 2007; Da-land et al., 2007; Landsbergen, 2009). In the same spirit, we use data from an ongoing stress shift in English noun/verb (N/V) pairs. Because stress has been listed in dictionaries for several centuries, we are able to trace stress longitudinally and at the level of individual words, and observe dynam-ics significantly more complicated than in changes previously considered in the computational litera-ture. In  X  2, we summarize aspects of the dynamics to be accounted for by any computational model of the stress shift. We also discuss proposed sources of these dynamics from the literature, based on ex-perimental work by psychologists and linguists.
In  X  3 X 4, we develop models in the mathemati-cal framework of dynamical systems (DS), which over the past 15 years has been used to model the interaction between language learning and lan-guage change in a variety of settings (Niyogi and Berwick, 1995; Niyogi and Berwick, 1996; Niyogi, 2006; Komarova et al., 2001; Yang, 2001; Yang, 2002; Mitchener, 2005; Pearl and Weinberg, 2007).

We interpret 6 aspects of the N/V stress dy-namics in DS terms; this gives a set of 6 desired properties to which any DS model X  X  dynamics can be compared. We consider 5 models of language learning by individuals, based on the experimen-tal findings relevant to the N/V stress shift, and evaluate the population-level dynamics of the dy-namical system model resulting from each against the set of desired properties. We are thus able to reason about which theories of the source of lan-guage change  X  considered as hypotheses about how individuals learn  X  lead to the population-level patterns observed in change. The data considered here are the stress patterns of English homographic, disyllabic noun/verb pairs (Table 1); we refer to these throughout as  X  X /V pairs X . Each of the N and V forms of a pair can { 1 , 1 }  X   X  X   X   X  X  (exile, anchor, fracture) { 1 , 2 }  X   X  X   X   X   X  (consort, protest, refuse) { 2 , 2 }  X   X   X   X   X   X  (cement, police, review) v.) stress. We use the notation { Nstress,Vstress } to denote the stress of an N/V pair, with 1=  X   X  X  , 2=  X   X   X  . Of the four logically possible stress pat-terns, all current N/V pairs follow one of the 3 patterns shown in Table 1: { 1,1 } , { 1,2 } , { 2,2 } . 3 No pair follows the fourth possible pattern, { 2,1 } .
N/V pairs have been undergoing variation and change between these 3 patterns since Middle En-glish (ME, c. 1066-1470), especially change to { 1,2 } . The vast majority of stress shifts occurred after 1570 (Minkova, 1997), when the first dictio-nary listing English word stresses was published (Levens, 1570). Many dictionaries from the 17th century on list word stresses, making it possible to trace change in the stress of individual N/V pairs in considerable detail. 2.1 Dynamics Expanding on dictionary pronunciation data col-lected by Sherman (1975) for the period 1570 X  1800, we have collected a corpus of pronunci-ations of 149 N/V pairs, as listed in 62 British dictionaries, published 1570 X 2007. Variation and change in N/V pair stress can be visualized by plotting stress trajectories : the moving average of N and V stress vs. time for a given pair. Some examples are shown in Fig. 1. The corpus is described in detail in (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010); here we summarize the relevant facts to be accounted for in a computational model. 4 Change Four types of clear-cut change between the three stress patterns are observed:
However, change to { 1,2 } is much more com-mon than change from { 1,2 } ; in particular, { 2,2 } X  X  1,2 } is the most common change. When change occurs, it is often fairly sudden, as in Figs. 1(a), 1(b). Finally, change never occurs di-rectly between { 1,1 } and { 2,2 } .
 Stability Previous work on stress in N/V pairs (Sherman, 1975; Phillips, 1984) has emphasized change, in particular { 2,2 } X  X  1,2 } (the most com-mon change). However, an important aspect of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs is stability: most N/V pairs do not show variation or change.
The 149 N/V pairs, used both in our corpus and in previous work, were chosen by Sherman (1975) as those most likely to have undergone change, and thus are not suitable for studying how stable the three attested stress patterns are. In a ran-dom sample of N/V pairs (not the set of 149) in use over a fixed time period (1700 X 2007), we find that only 12% have shown variation or change in stress (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010). Most pairs maintain the { 1,1 } , { 2,2 } , or { 1,2 } stress pattern for hundreds of years. A model of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pair stress must explain how it can be the case both that some pairs show varia-tion and change, and that many do not.
 Variation N/V pair stress patterns show both synchronic and diachronic variation.

Synchronically, there is variation at the pop-ulation level in the stress of some N/V pairs at any given time; this is reflected by the inclusion of more than one pronunciation for some N/V pairs in many dictionaries. An important question for modeling is whether there is variation within individual speakers. We show in (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010) that there is, for present-day American English speakers, using a corpus of ra-dio speech. For several N/V pairs which have currently variable pronunciation, 1/3 of speakers show variation in the stress of the N form. Metrical evidence from poetry suggests that individual vari-ation also existed in the past; the best evidence is for Shakespeare, who shows variation in the stress of over 20 N/V pairs (K  X  okeritz, 1953).

Diachronically, a relevant question for mod-eling is whether all variation is short-lived, or whether stable variation is possible. A particu-lar type of stable variation is in fact observed rela-tively often in the corpus: either the N or V form stably vary (Fig. 1(c)), but not both at once. Stable variation where both N and V forms vary almost never occurs (Fig. 1(d)).
 Frequency dependence Phillips (1984) hypoth-esizes that N/V pairs with lower frequencies (summed N+V word frequencies) are more likely to change to { 1,2 } . Sonderegger (2010) shows that this is the case for the most common change, { 2,2 } X  X  1,2 } : among N/V pairs which were { 2,2 } in 1700 and are either { 2,2 } or { 1,2 } today, those which have undergone change have signif-icantly lower frequencies, on average, than those which have not. In (Sonderegger and Niyogi, 2010), we give preliminary evidence from real-time frequency trajectories (for &lt; 10 N/V pairs) that it is not lower frequency per se which triggers change to { 1,2 } , but falling frequency. For exam-ple, change in combat from { 1,1 } X  X  1,2 } around 1800 (Fig. 1(b)) coincides with falling word fre-quency from 1775 X  X resent. 2.2 Sources of change The most salient facts about English N/V pair stress are that (a) change is most often to { 1,2 } (b) the { 2,1 } pattern never occurs. We summa-rize two types of explanation for these facts from the experimental literature, each of which exem-plifies a commonly-proposed type of explanation for phonological change. In both cases, there is ex-perimental evidence for biases in present-day En-glish speakers reflecting (a X  X ). We assume that these biases have been active over the course of the N/V stress shift, and can thus be seen as pos-sible sources of the diachronic dynamics of N/V pairs. 5 Analogy/Lexicon In historical linguistics, ana-logical changes are those which make  X ...related forms more similar to each other in their phonetic (and morphological) structure X  (Hock, 1991). 6 Proposed causes for analogical change thus often involve a speaker X  X  production and perception of a form being influenced by similar forms in their lexicon.

The English lexicon shows a broad tendency, which we call Ross X  generalization , which could be argued to be driving analogical change to { 1,2 } , and acting against the unobserved stress pattern { 2,1 } :  X  X rimary stress in English nouns is farther to the left than primary stress in English verbs X  (Ross, 1973). Change to { 1,2 } could be seen as motivated by Ross X  generalization, and { 2,1 } made impossible by it.

The argument is lent plausibility by experimen-tal evidence that Ross X  Generalization is reflected in production and perception. English listeners strongly prefer the typical stress pattern (N=  X   X  X  or V=  X   X   X  ) in novel English disyllables (Guion et al., 2003), and process atypical disyllables (N=  X   X   X  or V=  X   X  X  ) more slowly than typical ones (Arciuli and Cupples, 2003).
 Mistransmission An influential line of research holds that many phonological changes are based in asymmetric transmission errors: because of ar-ticulatory or perceptual factors, listeners systemat-ically mishear some sound  X  as  X  , but rarely mis-hear  X  as  X  . 7 We call such effects mistransmis-sion . Asymmetric mistransmission (by individu-als) is argued to be a necessary condition for the change  X   X   X  at the population level, and an ex-planation for why the change  X   X   X  is common, while the change  X   X   X  is rarely (or never) ob-served. Mistransmission-based explanations were pioneered by Ohala (1981, et seq. ), and are the subject of much recent work (reviewed by Hans-son, 2008)
For English N/V pairs, M. Kelly and collabo-rators have shown mistransmission effects which they propose are responsible for the directionality of the most common type of N/V pair stress shifts ( { 1,1 } , { 2,2 } X  X  1,2 } ), based on  X  X hythmic con-text X  (Kelly, 1988; Kelly and Bock, 1988; Kelly, 1989). Word stress is misperceived more often as initial in  X  X rochaic-biasing X  contexts, where the preceding syllable is weak or the following syl-lable is heavy; and more often as final in anal-ogously  X  X ambic-biasing X  contexts. Nouns occur more frequently in trochaic contexts, and verbs more frequently in iambic contexts; there is thus pressure for the V forms of { 1,1 } pairs to be mis-perceived as  X   X   X  , and for the N forms of { 2,2 } pairs to be misperceived as  X   X  X  . We first describe assumptions and notation for models developed below (  X  4).

Because of the evidence for within-speaker variation in N/V pair stress (  X  2.1), in all models described below, we assume that what is learned for a given N/V pair are the probabilities of using the  X   X   X  form for the N and V forms.
 We also make several simplifying assumptions. There are discrete generations G t , and learners in G t learn from G t  X  1 . Each example a learner in G t hears is equally likely to come from any member of G t  X  1 . Each learner receives an identical num-ber of examples, and each generation has infinitely many members.

These are idealizations, adopted here to keep models simple enough to analyze; the effects of relaxing some of these assumptions have been ex-plored by Niyogi (2006) and Sonderegger (2009). The infinite-population assumption in particular makes the dynamics fully deterministic; this rules out the possibility of change due to drift (or sam-ple variation ), where a form disappears from the population because no examples of it are encoun-tered by learners in G t in the input from G t  X  1 . Notation For a fixed N/V pair, a learner in G t hears N 1 examples of the N form, of which k t 1 are defined for V examples. Each example is sampled i.i.d. from a random member of G t  X  1 . The N i are fixed (each learner hears the same number of ex-amples), while the k t i are random variables (over learners in G t ). Each learner applies an algorithm A to the N 1 + N 2 examples to learn  X   X  t ,  X   X  t  X  [0 , 1] , the probabilities of producing N and V examples as  X   X   X  .  X  t ,  X  t are the expectation of  X   X  t and  X   X  members of G t :  X  t = E (  X   X  t ) ,  X  t = E (  X   X  t ) .  X   X   X   X  t are thus random variables (over learners in G t ), while  X  t , X  t  X  [0 , 1] are numbers.

Because learners in G t draw examples at ran-dom from members of G t  X  1 , the distributions of  X   X  t and  X   X  t are determined by (  X  t  X  1 , X  t  X  1 (  X  t , X  t ) , the expectations of  X   X  t and determined by (  X  t  X  1 , X  t  X  1 ) via an iterated map f : f : [0 , 1] 2  X  [0 , 1] 2 , f (  X  t , X  t ) = (  X  t +1 , X  3.1 Dynamical systems We develop and analyze models of populations of language learners in the mathematical framework of (discrete) dynamical systems (DS) (Niyogi and Berwick, 1995; Niyogi, 2006). This setting allows us to determine the diachronic, population-level consequences of assumptions about the learning algorithm used by individuals, as well as assump-tions about population structure or the input they receive.

Because it is in general impossible to solve a given iterated map as a function of t , the dynam-ical systems viewpoint is to understand its long-term behavior by finding its fixed points and bi-furcations : changes in the number and stability of fixed points as system parameters vary.

Briefly,  X   X  is a fixed point (FP) of f if f (  X   X  ) =  X  ; it is stable if lim near  X   X  , and unstable otherwise; these are also called stable states and unstable states . Intuitively,  X   X  is stable iff the system is stable under small per-turbations from  X   X  . 8
In the context of a linguistic population, change from state  X  (100% of the population uses { 1,1 } ) to state  X  (100% of the population uses { 1,2 } ) corresponds to a bifurcation, where some system parameter ( N ) passes a critical value ( N 0 ). For N&lt;N 0 ,  X  is stable. For N&gt;N 0 ,  X  is unstable, and  X  is stable; this triggers change from  X  to  X  . 3.2 DS interpretation of observed dynamics Below, we describe 5 DS models of linguistic pop-ulations. To interpret whether each model has properties consistent with the N/V dataset, we translate the observations about the dynamics of N/V stress made above (  X  2.1) into DS terms. This gives a list of desired properties against which to evaluate the properties of each model. 1.  X  { 2,1 } : { 2,1 } is not a stable state. 2. Stability of { 1,1 } , { 1,2 } , { 2,2 } : These stress 3. Observed stable variation : Stable states are 4. Sudden change : Change from one stress pat-5. Observed changes : There are bifurcations 6. Observed frequency dependence : Change to We now describe 5 DS models, each correspond-ing to a learning algorithm A used by individual language learners. Each A leads to an iterated map, f (  X  t , X  t ) = (  X  t +1 , X  t +1 ) , which describes the state of the population of learners over succes-sive generations. We give these evolution equa-tions for each model, then discuss their dynamics, i.e. bifurcation structure. Each model X  X  dynam-ics are evaluated with respect to the set of desired properties corresponding to patterns observed in the N/V data. Derivations have been mostly omit-ted for reasons of space, but are given in (Son-deregger, 2009).

The models differ along two dimensions, cor-responding to assumptions about the learning al-gorithm ( A ): whether or not it is assumed that the stress of examples is possibly mistransmitted (Models 1, 3, 5), and how the N and V probabil-ities acquired by a given learner are coupled . In Model 1 there is no coupling (  X   X  t and  X   X  t learned independently), in Models 2 X 3 coupling takes the form of a hard constraint corresponding to Ross X  generalization, and in Models 4 X 5 different stress patterns have different prior probabilities. 9 4.1 Model 1: Mistransmission Motivated by the evidence for asymmetric mis-perception of N/V pair stress (  X  2.2), suppose the stress of N=  X   X   X  and V=  X   X  X  examples may be mis-perceived (as N=  X   X  X  and V=  X   X   X  ), with mistrans-mission probabilities p and q .

Learners are assumed to simply probability match:  X   X  t = k t 1 /N 1 ,  X   X  t = k t 2 /N 2 , where k t number of N and V examples heard as  X   X   X  (etc.) The probabilities p N,t &amp; p V,t of hearing an N or V example as final stressed at t are then p k 1 and k P
B ( k  X  t and  X  t , the probability that a random member of G t produces N and V examples as  X   X   X  , are the ensemble averages of  X   X  t and  X   X  t over all members of G t . Because we have assumed infinitely many learners per generation,  X  t = E (  X   X  t ) and  X  t = E (  X  Using (1), and the formula for the expectation of a binomially-distributed random variable: these are the evolution equations for Model 1. Due to space constraints we do not give the (more lengthy) derivations of the evolution equations in Models 2 X 5.
 Dynamics There is a single, stable fixed point of evolution equations (3 X 4): (  X   X  , X   X  ) = (0 , 1) , corresponding to the stress pattern { 1,2 } . This model thus shows none of the desired properties discussed in  X  3.2, except that { 1,2 } corresponds to a stable state. 4.2 Model 2: Coupling by constraint Motivated by the evidence for English speak-ers X  productive knowledge of Ross X  Generaliza-tion (  X  2.2), we consider a second learning model in which the learner attempts to probability match as above, but the (  X   X  t ,  X   X  t ) learned must satisfy the constraint that  X   X   X  stress be more probable in the V form than in the N form.

Formally, the learner chooses (  X   X  t ,  X   X  t ) satisfying a quadratic optimization problem: minimize [(  X   X  This corresponds to the following algorithm, A 2 : 2. Otherwise, set  X   X  t =  X   X  t = 1 2 ( k t 1 N The resulting evolution equations can be shown to be where A = X Dynamics Adding the equations in (5) gives that the (  X  t , X  t ) trajectories are lines of constant  X  t +  X  t (Fig. 2). All (0 ,x ) and ( x, 1) ( x  X  [0 , 1] ) are stable fixed points. This model thus has sta-ble FPs corresponding to { 1,1 } , { 1,2 } , and { 2,2 } , does not have { 2,1 } as a stable FP (by construc-tion), and allows for sta-ble variation in exactly one of N or V. It does not have bifurcations, or the observed patterns of change and frequency de-pendence. 4.3 Model 3: Coupling by constraint, with We now assume that each example is subject to mistransmission, as in Model 1; the learner then applies A 2 to the heard examples. The evolution equations are thus the same as in (5), but with  X  t  X  1 and  X  t  X  1 changed to p N,t , p V,t (Eqn. 1). Dynamics There is a single, stable fixed point, corresponding to stable variation in both N and V. This model thus shows none of the desired prop-erties, except that { 2,1 } is not a stable FP (by con-struction). 4.4 Model 4: Coupling by priors The type of coupling assume in Models 2 X 3  X  a constraint on the relative probability of  X   X   X  stress for N and V forms  X  has the drawback that there is no way for the rest of the lexicon to affect a pair X  X  N and V stress probabilities: there can be no influence of the stress of other N/V pairs, or in the lexicon as a whole, on the N/V pair being learned. Models 4 X 5 allow such influence by formalizing a simple intuitive explanation for the lack of { 2 , 1 } N/V pairs: learners cannot hypothesize a { 2 , 1 } pair because there is no support for this pattern in their lexicons.

We now assume that learners compute the prob-abilities of each possible N/V pair stress pattern , rather than separate probabilities for the N and V forms. We assume that learners keep two sets of 1. Learned probabilities : 2. Prior probabilities : ~  X  = (  X  11 , X  12 , X  21 , X  22 ) ,
The learner then produces N forms as follows: 1. Pick a pattern { n 1 ,v 1 } according to ~ P . 2. Pick a pattern { n 2 ,v 2 } according to ~  X  3. Repeat 1 X 2 until n 1 = n 2 , then produce N= n 1 . V forms are produced similarly, but checking whether v 1 = v 2 at step 3. Learners X  production of an N/V pair is thus influenced by both their learn-ing experience (for the particular N/V pair) and by how much support exists in their lexicon for the different stress patterns.

We leave the exact interpretation of the  X  ij am-biguous; they could be the percentage of N/V pairs already learned which follow each stress pattern, for example. Motivated by the absence of { 2,1 } N/V pairs in English, we assume that  X  21 = 0 .
By following the production algorithm above, the learner X  X  probabilities of producing N and V forms as  X   X   X  are:  X   X  t =  X   X  ( k  X   X  this case we set  X   X  ( N 1 , 0) =  X  22 and  X   X  ( N 1 , 0) =  X 
The evolution equations are then  X  t = E (  X   X  t ) =  X  t = E ( Dynamics The fixed points of (8 X 9) are (0 , 0) , (0 , 1) , and (1 , 1) ; their stabilities depend on N 1 N 2 , and R = There are 6 regions of parameter space in which different FPs are stable: 1.  X  11 , X  22 &lt;  X  12 : (0 , 1) stable 2.  X  22 &gt;  X  12 , R &lt; 1 : (0 , 1) , (1 , 1) stable 3.  X  11 &lt;  X  12 &lt;  X  22 , R &gt; 1 : (1 , 1) stable 4.  X  11 , X  22 &gt;  X  12 : (0 , 0) , (1 , 1) stable 5.  X  22 &lt;  X  12 &lt;  X  11 , R &gt; 1 : (0 , 0) stable 6.  X  11 &gt;  X  12 , R &lt; 1 : (0 , 0) , (0 , 1) stable
The parameter space is split into these regimes by three hyperplanes:  X  11 =  X  12 ,  X  22 =  X  12 , and R = 1 . Given that  X  21 = 0 ,  X  12 = 1  X   X  11  X   X  22 , and the parameter space is 4-dimensional: (  X  11 , X  22 ,N 1 ,N 2 ) . Fig. 3 shows An example phase diagram in (  X  11 , X  2 ) , with N 1 and N 2 fixed.
The bifurcation structure implies all 6 possi-ble changes between the three FPs ( { 1,1 } * ) { 1,2 } , pose the system is at stable FP (1 , 1) (correspond-ing to { 2,2 } ) in region 2. As  X  22 is decreased, we move into region 1, (1 , 1) becomes unstable, and the system shifts to stable FP (0 , 1) . This transi-tion corresponds to change from { 2,2 } to { 1,2 } .
Note that change to { 1,2 } entails crossing the hyperplanes  X  12 =  X  22 and  X  12 =  X  11 . These hy-perplanes do not change as N 1 and N 2 vary, so Figure 3: Example phase diagram in (  X  11 , X  22 ) for Model 4, with N 1 = 5 , N 2 = 10 . Numbers are regions of parameter space (see text). change to { 1,2 } is not frequency-dependent. How-ever, change from { 1,2 } entails crossing the hy-perplane R = 1 , which does change as N 1 and N 2 vary (Eqn. 10), so change from { 1,2 } is frequency-dependent. Thus, although there is frequency de-pendence in this model, it is not as observed in the diachronic data, where change to { 1,2 } is frequency-dependent.

Finally, no stable variation is possible: in every stable state, all members of the population cate-gorically use a single stress pattern. { 2,1 } is never a stable FP, by construction. 4.5 Model 5: Coupling by priors, with We now suppose that each example from a learner X  X  data is possibly mistransmitted, as in Model 1; the learner then applies the algorithm from Model 4 to the heard examples (instead of using k t 1 , k t 2 ) . The evolution equations are thus the same as (8 X 9), but with  X  t  X  1 and  X  t  X  1 changed to p N,t , p V,t (Eqn. 1).
 Dynamics (0 , 1) is always a fixed point. For some regions of parameter space, there can be one fixed point of the form (  X , 1) , as well as one fixed point of the form (0 , X  ) , where  X , X   X  (0 , 1) . De-fine R 0 = (1  X  p )(1  X  q ) R ,  X  0 12 =  X  12 , and  X  There are 6 regions of parameter space corre-sponding to different stable FPs, identical to the 6 regions in Model 4, with the following substitu-Figure 4: Example of falling N 1 triggering change from (1 , 1) to (0 , 1) for Model 5. Dashed line = stable FP of the form (  X , 1) , solid line = stable FP (0 , 1) . For N 1 &gt; 4 , there is a stable FP near (1 , 1) . For N 1 &lt; 2 , (0 , 1) is the only stable FP.  X  22 = 0 . 58 ,  X  12 = 0 . 4 , N 2 = 10 , p = q = 0 . 05 . tions made: R  X  R 0 ,  X  ij  X   X  0 ij , (0 , 0)  X  (0 , X  ) , (1 , 1)  X  (  X , 1) .

The parameter space is again split into these regions by three hyperplanes:  X  0 11 =  X  0 12 ,  X  0 22 =  X  and R 0 = 1 . As in Model 4, the bifurcation structure implies all 6 possible changes between the three FPs. However, change to { 1,2 } entails crossing now frequency dependent.

In particular, consider a system at a stable FP (  X , 1) , for some N/V pair. This FP becomes un-stable if  X  0 22 becomes smaller than  X  0 12 . Assuming that the  X  ij are fixed, this occurs only if N 1 falls below a critical value, N  X  1 = (1  X   X  22  X  the system would then transition to (0 , 1) , the only stable state. By a similar argument, falling fre-quency can lead to change from (0 , X  ) to (0 , 1) . Falling frequency can thus cause change to { 1,2 } in this model, as seen in the N/V data; Fig. 4 shows an example.

Unlike in Model 4, stable variation of the type seen in the N/V stress trajectories  X  one of N or V stably varying, but not both  X  is possible for some parameter values. (0 , 0) and (1 , 1) (corresponding to { 1,1 } and { 2,2 } ) are technically never possible, but effectively occur for FPs of the form (  X , 0) and (  X , 1) when  X  or  X  are small. { 2,1 } is never a sta-ble FP, by construction.

This model thus arguably shows all of the de-sired properties seen in the N/V data.

Based on this set of models, we are able to make some observations about the effect of dif-ferent assumptions about learning by individuals on population-level dynamics. Models including asymmetric mistransmission (1, 3, 5) generally do not lead to stable states in which the entire pop-ulation uses { 1,1 } or { 2,2 } . (In Model 5, sta-ble variation very near { 1,1 } or { 2,2 } is possi-ble.) However, { 1,1 } and { 2,2 } are diachroni-cally very stable stress patterns, suggesting that at least for this model set, assuming mistransmission in the learner is problematic. Models 2 X 3, where analogy is implemented as a hard constraint based on Ross X  generalization, do not give most desired properties. Models 4 X 5, where analogy is imple-mented as prior probabilities over N/V stress pat-terns, show crucial aspects of the observed dynam-ics: bifurcations corresponding to the changes ob-served in the stress data. Model 5 shows change to { 1,2 } triggered by falling frequency, a pattern observed in the stress data, and an emergent prop-erty of the model dynamics: this frequency effect is not present in Models 1 or 4, but is present in Model 5, where the learner combines mistransmis-sion (Model 1) with coupling by priors (Model 4). We have developed 5 dynamical systems models for a relatively complex diachronic change, found one successful model, and were able to reason about the source of model behavior. Each model describes the diachronic, population-level conse-quences of assuming a particular learning algo-rithm for individuals. The algorithms considered were motivated by different possible sources of change, from linguistics and psychology (  X  2.2). We discuss novel contributions of this work, and future directions.

The dataset used here shows more complex dy-namics, to our knowledge, than in changes previ-ously considered in the computational literature. By using a detailed, longitudinal dataset, we were able to strongly constrain the desired behavior of a computational model, so that the task of model building is not  X  X oomed to success X . While all models show some patterns observed in the data, only one shows all such properties. We believe de-tailed datasets are potentially very useful for eval-uating and differentiating between proposed com-putational models of change.

This paper is a first attempt to integrate detailed data with a range of DS models. We have only considered some schematic properties of the dy-namics observed in our dataset, and used these to qualitatively compare each model X  X  predictions to the dynamics. Future work should consider the dynamics in more detail, develop more com-plex models (for example, by relaxing the infinite-population assumption, allowing for stochastic dy-namics), and quantitatively compare model pre-dictions and observed dynamics.

We were able to reason about how assump-tions about individual learning affect population dynamics by analyzing a range of simple, related models. This approach is pursued in more depth in the larger set of models considered in (Son-deregger, 2009). Our use of model comparison contrasts with most recent computational work on change, where a small number (1 X 2) of very com-plex models are analyzed, allowing for much more detailed models of language learning and usage than those considered here (e.g. Choudhury et al., 2006; Minett &amp; Wang, 2008; Baxter et al., 2009; Landsbergen, 2009). An advantage of our ap-proach is an enhanced ability to evaluate a range of proposed causes for a particular case of language change.

By using simple models, we were able to con-sider a range of learning algorithms correspond-ing to different explanations for the observed di-achronic dynamics. What makes this a useful ex-ercise is the fundamentally non-trivial map, illus-trated by Models 1 X 5, between individual learn-ing and population-level dynamics. Although the type of individual learning assumed in each model was chosen with the same patterns of change in mind, and despite the simplicity of the models used, the resulting population-level dynamics dif-fer greatly. This is an important point given that proposed explanations for change (e.g., mistrans-mission and analogy) operate at the level of in-dividuals, while the phenomena being explained (patterns of change, or particular changes) are as-pects of the population-level dynamics.
