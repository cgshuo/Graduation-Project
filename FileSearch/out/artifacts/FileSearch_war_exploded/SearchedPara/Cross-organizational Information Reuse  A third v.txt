 Small organizations are facing a knowledge predicament as they operate with increasingly sparse pools of employees that must support a broad range of organizational needs. With reduced human resources comes limited time to devote to ancillary work tasks such as documentation. When no local memory system is available, organizati ons resort to Internet-based repositories. Though these sources contain nearly limitless information they do so at the cost of rich local context. To bridge the gap between internal and Internet-based memory systems this research explores a third vision; one which establishes virtual partnerships between small organizations. Using ethnographic methods this field study examines the: socio-technical ramifications of cross-organizational information reuse, relevance of information develope d by partner organizations, and system tools that support effici ent cross-organizational knowledge flow. H.5.3 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Group and Organization Interfaces  X  computer supported collaborative work Management, Documentation, Design, Human Factors Organizational memory, know ledge management, cross-organizational, reuse, socio-technical Reusing information developed by others is a natural phenomenon that occurs during casual conversations; as employees pass each other in the hallways, have lunch together, or attend meetings they trade  X  X ar stories, X  discuss current projects that they are working on, and talk about their victorie s over pernicious problems. While at its core this exchange is a soci al event, it is a critical component of effective knowledge mana gement. When shared with colleagues, context rich inform ation is brought to bear on new challenges that are encountered, pot entially avoiding the need to re-create solutions to previously solved problems. Casual information reuse has long been recognized as a valuable organizational asset [2]. To capitalize on those assets, entities have attempted to manage knowl edge by capturing information within computer-based repositori es (e.g., Answer Garden [1]) collectively referred to as organizational memory systems (OMS). Despite the potential value of leveraging OMS, small organizations (those containing fewer than 500 employees [6]) have been unable to capitalize on its promised value. Existing visions of OMS, as discussed belo w, have largely side-stepped the unique needs of these small organi zations. This relegates them to use applications designed to ta ke advantage of large pools of experts, or to use external sources that have limited capability to fit nuanced problems situated within the context of their organization. Two existing visions of OMS exis t: systems designed for internal use and systems designed to leve rage external sources. Although potentially powerful, both visi ons are not without limitations, particularly when applied w ithin small organizations. In the first vision, OMS are de signed to leverage internal repositories and social networks of experts. They are primarily beneficial within large organiza tions where experts are abundant. As pools of experts become less plentiful, more time must be devoted to employees X  primary job functions, constraining OMS-related documentation activities a nd increasing the likelihood that the process will be abandoned altogether. When no local memory system is available, organizations resort to external repositories. In the second vision, OMS are desi gned to leverage Internet-based repositories such as Microsof t X  X  knowledge base. However, external sources are used at the cost of reduced localized context and culture. Shared understanding of context (conditions that make a situation understandable su ch as political, financial, and environmental factors) and cultu re (the  X  X atterned ways of thinking, feeling and reacting...constituting the distinctive achievements of human groups, in cluding their embodiments in artifacts [4] X ) are central to knowledge transfer processes. Researchers such as Walsh and Ungson [7] and Davenport [3] have argued that culture and context are critical, stating that both should be added to stored information in order to increase value, provide correct interpretation , and to make information actionable. To address the gap between local systems and Internet-based systems, a third vision of OMS is required. This vision suggests that sharing information be tween parallel, non-competing organizations provides a useful alternative [8]. Parallel, non-competing organizations are those entities that operate within the same domain of work and do not directly compete with each other. Within each domain thes e parallel organizations share similar organizational structures, recurring problems, information needs, and focus of work and purpose. A cross-organizational OMS expands the available pools of experts through information partne rships. When local experts are either unavailable or unable to assist with a problem the information-seeker may consu lt with a cross-organizational expert. In this scenario the pa rtner expert(s) may be able to provide assistance at a reduced cost of context when compared to those randomly located via external sources. This occurs because they are engaged in similar work and are employed in organizations that are devoted to similar purposes, increasing the likelihood of overlap in cultural and contextual backgrounds. Thus, the quality of located information is richer than that found through random external sources. This third vision of cross-organizational OMS is intended to provide a balance between internal and external systems, and yields strong potential to positivel y impact small organizations by enabling them to reap similar benefits enjoyed by their larger counterparts. In order to understand routine work and gain a deep understanding of cross-organizational information reuse, this research explores the phenomena in situ . Such exploration provides the most naturalistic setting. It allows part icipants to interact with their usual surroundings and colleagues, and to be influenced by contextual and cultural factors. Participants must react to real situations where the motivation to find answers is not artificially derived and carries full consequences of any failures. Ethnographic field research methods, including interviews, contextual inquiry, and experien ce sampling methods, are applied in the study of two classes of organizations: (a) public school districts, and (b) public libraries to explore existing practices of information reuse. After gaining insight into existing practices, a prototype cross-organizational OMS using Microsoft X  X  SharePoint architecture is introduced. The application includes traditional document repositories and discussi on forums as well as social computing components such as wiki s, social tagging, and blogs. Participants X  use of the prot otype is examined through a triangulation of qualitat ive and quantitative data collection to explore the application types that participants gravitate towards based on the nature of informati on being shared (e.g., wikis for informal and collaborative documentation and traditional repositories for formal documen tation efforts), and the socio-technical process of sharing in formation across organizations. Interview data will be compared with system-generated usage logs. Analytic techniques are derived from Grounded Theory [5]. Finally, participants will evaluate the relevance and satisfaction of stored information using a Like rt-scale evaluation instrument. Evaluations will provide insight into the effects that contextual distance between information source and information-seeker has on document satisfaction, guiding future designs that support information-seeking behaviors. Like rt data will be analyzed using statistical methods. The results of qualitative an d quantitative data from each organizational class (schools and libraries) will be used to form a comparative case study. Through comparison, commonalities emerge yielding a set of design guidelines and a more complete understanding of the effectiveness of the third vision of OMS. Although this research is at an early stage, several preliminary findings have emerged from extens ive pilot studies. First, as reported in [8], participants in public schools are eager to share information with each other. Even when school districts are competing for financial resources such as grants, they are often willing to share strategies and best practices which may diminish their competitive edge. Similarly, few social or political barriers exist to information sharing. These were limited to concerns over losing face, lack of reciprocation, and time requirements. Overall, participants (n=37) embraced cross-organizational information sharing and were eager for a means to facilitate the process. Secondly, preliminary results on the effects of contextual distance between information-seeker and s ource indicate that procedural documents from manufacturer knowle dge bases were at least as satisfactory as those created in-house [9]. This suggests that there is limited contextual degradation in procedural material that discusses steps to accomplish a specific task. Such documentation may be sufficiently useful regardless of its origination. These preliminary results will be verified and expanded upon through the research described herein, which is currently under way. [1] Ackerman, M.S., &amp; D.W. McDonald. (1996).
