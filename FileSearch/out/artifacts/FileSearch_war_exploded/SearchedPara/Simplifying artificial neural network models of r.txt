  X  , in the Southern Brazil. The main result of this method of simplifying 1. Introduction modelling the complex inter-relatio nships occurring in nature, parti-cularly where such models are requi red for simulation, forecasting and classi fi cation ( Valen X a and Ludermir, 2007; Bowden et al., 2005 ).
ANNs have found applications in such diverse areas as neuroscience ( Guo et al., 2010 ), energy resources ( Li and Shi, 2010 ), speech recognition ( Dahl et al., 2012 ) and water resources ( Talebizadeh and Moridnejad, 2011 ). Within the present context of hydrological simulation or forecast ing, some excellent results have been reported from the use of ANNs ( Shamseldin, 1997; Dawson and Wilby, 1998;
Sajikumar and Thandaveswara, 1999; Sudheer et al., 2002; Jain et al., 2004; Jain and Kumar, 2007; Tiwari and Chatterjee, 2010; Piotrowski and Napiorkowski, 2011 ).

Despite such promising results, however, ANNs are commonly classi fi ed as  X  black box  X  models, since in the context of hydrological simulation they do not explain th e physical processes of rivers and drainage basins which give rise to runoff ( Hsu et al., 1995; Bishop, 1995; Jain et al., 2004 ). The dif fi culty of understanding how an ANN works is even greater when there is an excess of connections: i.e., many input variables and a large number of hidden-layer neurons.
Furthermore, redundancy in the input layer often leads to a loss of ef fi ciency in ANN performance, since internal weights are in fl ced by all inputs. Thus an unnecessary variable can make network training and learning dif fi cult, or even cause its partial failure, resulting in a set of weights which do not adequately model the phenomenon being studied.

Simpli fi cation of ANN-based models is desirable, whether by means of a stricter selection of input nodes or a procedure by which unnecessary variables can be identi fi ed and excluded, not only as a means of securing more satisfactory results from the model but also to improve understanding of how it works. However few papers express concern about this aspect of ANN-based modelling ( Maier and Dandy, 2000; Bowden et al., 2005 ).
Although there are useful reports which evaluate the contribu-tion of ANN input variables, there are also con fl icting results from research aimed at comparing methods for evaluating the contri-bution of input variables or their selection and exclusion. The dif fi culty in evaluating the methodology is mainly the conse-quence of not being able to know the best set of inputs, because of the many possible combinations of data sequences present in real hydrological problems (with 20 inputs, for example, there are 1048 575 different combinations). Also in the various methods reported, the criteria or thresholds adopted for variable exclusion as a means of improving performance or reducing computational effort are not normally consistent.

A particularly notable method is one which calculates the sum of the products of internal weights: namely the Overall Connection Weights (OCW) method. In their paper comparing it with other methods, Olden et al. (2004) describe OCW as the most appro-priate method for ordering ANN input variables according to their importance. Using the method of Olden and Jackson (2002) ,itis possible to establish a signi fi cance level for excluding variables or internal connections by randomly perturbing the model output and by re-starting the training process. However the method is not very ef fi cient computationally, since training must be repeated a considerable number of times. In the Olden and Jackson (2002) procedure, also, the ef fi ciency of excluding variables or connec-tions was not evaluated in terms of the resulting model, and little attention was paid to the hypothesis that one input variable may have its contribution in fl uenced by interaction with other vari-ables present in the model. There is therefore no guarantee that the simpli fi ed model has better quality or is more parsimonious.
In this context, the contribution of this paper is to present an automated methodology, computationally ef fi cient, to evaluate the importance of the input variables and to reduce the dimensions that compose an ANN hydrological model, with the exclusion of the less relevant input variables. The method for excluding input variables is iterative and computationally ef fi cient: it consists of perturbing the input variables, measuring the effect on model performance, establishing an index which shows the contribution of each variable in the ANN, and excluding the variables judged least in fl uential according to a threshold value. The method was used to simulate mean daily fl ow over a 20-year period in four nested drainage basins at different scales, with areas ranging from 20 km  X  to 9426 km  X  , in the north-east of the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul.

In developing countries such as Brazil there are very few data available from small drainage basins, and it is important to estimate their mean daily fl ows for water resource management. Not only are such records few in number, but also those that do exist are often fragmented, so that taking into account the uncertainties inherent in acquiring the records, a signi fi cant proportion of them are not suited for hydrological use. Forecasting with time-horizon of one day, without using as inputs the fl ow data recorded at the site at which forecasts are required (that is, without autoregressive components) is compatible with the size of basins used in the study, and with the objectives of record extension and estimation of missing hydrological data. 2. Revision of methods for selecting and determining the contribution of input variables in ANNs
ANNs have their origin in the publication of McCulloch and Pitts (1943) , inspired by biological considerations. The corresponding network had the ability to represent simple logical functions similar to those of the human brain. However with the feedback algorithm developed by Rumelhart et al. (1986) for training multi-layered neural networks, ANNs attracted wider interest and began to receive continuous and growing research funding, because of their potential for modelling non-linear relationships. The feedback algorithm is a generalization to multi-layer networks of the Delta Rule created by Widrow and
Hoff (1960) . Updating the weights at a neuron depends only on the errors, the inputs and the derivative at the neuron. Errors at the hidden neuron layer are calculated from the errors at the output neuron layer.

It is worth noting that, continuously, new techniques have been developed in ANNs, to improve the training process and also the performance of the results, as can be seen in Khashei and Bijari (2011) , Lu et al. (2011) , Ozturk and Karaboga (2011) and Slowik (2011) .

A number of methods have been proposed for analyzing the relation between ANN input and output variables, for the purpose of ordering the variables  X  contributions and hence selecting those that best explain the phenomenon being modelled. Bowden et al. (2005) classify these methods as follows: (i) those based on prior knowledge of the system being modelled; (ii) those based on linear cross-correlation; (iii) those using heuristic approaches; (iv) those derived from information extracted from previously trained
ANNs through sensitivity analysis after the model has been perturbed, or from an analysis of weights or the signs of connec-tions; (v) those consisting of combinations of the above.
The method based on prior knowledge is frequently used to select the variables used in the model initially (for example, Campolo et al., 1999 and Jayawardena et al., 1997 ). Being a subjective method, its use in isolation can result in a loss of information that is important for theANN,orintheinclusionofunnecessaryvariableswhichmake training dif fi cult.

According to Bowden et al. (2005) , correlation analysis is the most popular method for selecting input variables (for example, Maier and Dandy, 1997; Sajikumar and Thandaveswara, 1999;
Imrie et al., 2000 ). The main drawback to this approach is that it only detects linear dependence between variables and can fail to detect non-linear dependence.

The most common heuristic approach is the step-by-step selection of variables through the addition or elimination of inputs, and observing the effect on the modeled result ( Gevrey et al., 2003 ). It may be used forwards (Forward Stepwise Addition) or backwards (Backward Stepwise Elimination). The forward method is the most widely used ( Bowden et al., 2005 ), as in the study by Maier et al. (1998) , which aimed to determine the most important input variables in an ecological forecasting application.
Bowden et al. (2005) and Gevrey et al. (2003) consider that the greatest disadvantage of the method is the intensive computa-tional effort required, since a new model is generated at each step.
The results also commonly diverge from those found when other methods are used.

To reduce the computational load, Gevrey et al. (2003) pre-sented an improved Stepwise method, in which only one model is fi tted. Variables are successively either removed (Improved Step-wise 1), or substituted by a mean value (Improved Stepwise 2), giving rise to changes in mean quadratic error by which variables can be ordered ( Gevrey et al., 2003; Olden et al., 2004 ). Regarding methods which extract information from trained
ANNs, the sensitivity analysis proposed by Lek et al. (1995,1996) is the most commonly used ( Bowden et al., 2005 ), as shown in work by Maier and Dandy (1996) , Gevrey et al. (2003) and Olden et al. (2004) . In such analyses the contribution of each variable is studied individually. The recorded values of each input vari-able are altered (to pre-determined values: the third quartile for example) with the values of remaining variables fi xed, and the difference in ANN output is measured. Repeating the process in succession for all input nodes gives the changes in output for different changes to inputs, so that the in fl uence of each change to the model is obtained.
 1996) , is the Input Perturbation Method, used in studies by Scardi and Harding (1999) , Gevrey et al. (2003) and Olden et al. (2004) .
The importance of an input variable is quanti fi ed by the change in mean square error when it is perturbed (as an example, 50% of each input).
 methods which analyze the ANN internally are (a) overall connec-tion weights (OCW); (b) Garson  X  s algorithm; (c) partial derivatives.
The fi rst of these, by Olden and Jackson (2002) , evaluates the importance of a variable by calculating the product of connection weights between the input, hidden and output layers. The authors propose an approach in which random perturbations are intro-duced to verify the signi fi cance of synaptic weights and to eliminate the weakest connections by using a threshold, resulting in an irregular ANN: that is, one in which the input nodes are not necessarily connected to all neurons in the hidden layer. The second algorithm, proposed by Garson (1991) and again by Goh (1995) , is similar to the previous one, except that no account is taken of signs and only the absolute values of weights are used ( Gevrey et al., 2003; Olden et al., 2004 ). The in fl uence of variables is measured by the relation between the weights associated with each input node and the sum of all synaptic weights. Studies by
Mak and Blanning (1998) and Guha et al. (2005) also give variants of this method. The third algorithm is based on the calculation of partial derivatives of ANN outputs with respect to the inputs (see Dimopoulos et al., 1995 ).
 evaluating the contribution made by variables: partial derivatives; the Input Perturbation Method; Garson  X  s algorithm; Lek  X  tivity analysis; forward stepwise; backward stepwise; improved stepwise 1; improved stepwise 2. They found that the most consistent results were given by the partial derivative method, by Lek  X  s sensitivity analysis, and by the Input Perturbation Method.
The worst results were given by the traditional Stepwise (Forward e Backward) methods. Olden et al. (2004) also compared the methods listed above, including also the method which uses the sum of products of internal weights (OCW), which gave the most consistent results, the worst being given by Garson  X  s algorithm. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Study area within the basin of the Rio Iju X  ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ), in the north-west of the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul. Flow gauging stations were sited at Ponte M X stica (drainage area 9426 km ) and Santo  X ngelo (5414 km  X  ), operated by CPRM (Companhia de Pesquisa em Recursos Minerais) and at Tabo X o (80 km  X  ) and
Turcato (19.4 km  X  ), operated by IPH (Hydraulic Research Institute) of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). This area was chosen principally because it has been monitored by IPH since 1989 with a bank of hydrological data for longer than 20 years ( Castro et al., 1999, 2010 ). 3.2. Materials daily rainfall data, supplied by IPH and interpolated by the natural neighbour method to the basins being simulated. The method for calculating mean daily rainfall is given by Silva (2011) , who compared four interpolation methods (inverse squared distance weighting; natural neighbour; nearest neighbour; and linear triangulation) applied to the same basins as those used in the present work. Daily rainfall over the basin was obtained as the mean rainfall interpolated at all the nodes of a rectangular grid covering the basin with spatially-differentiated resolution accord-ing to basin size. Each method was evaluated by cross validation; (ii) mean daily fl ow data from the Turcato and Tabo X o gauging stations, supplied by IPH ( Castro et al., 2010 ); (iii) mean daily data from Santo  X ngelo, Ponte M X stica and Potiribu stations, obtained from the Brazilian agency ANA (Ag X ncia Nacional de
 X guas). The simulation period was from January 1989 to July 2009, although there were some discontinuities in record, different for each basin. 3.3. Methods 3.3.1. ANN hydrological model
The programs used for this research, including the ANN training, were written by the authors into the Matlab R2010a environment. It was developed a generalized model, composed of linear transformations of inputs and outputs of a neural network with an internal layer (Eq. (1) ). y where: x t and y t are the input and output variables, respectively; s and p o are the scale and position parameters of the model outputs; s and p i are the scale and position parameters of the model inputs; ANN is the Arti fi cial Neural Network.

The ANN constitutes the core of the model, represented by Eq. (2) :
ANN x t p i s output ( o ) layers, while e o is the expected error in the output layer.
Each layer consists of processing units, called neurons, in which a transfer function, named activation function, is applied to the total inputs of the unit ( n ), where n  X   X  i wx  X  b . The activation function used, both for the hidden layers and for the output layers, is the sigmoid function (Eq. (3) ), whose derivative with respect to its total input is known and given by Eq. (4) . a  X  fn  X  X  X  1 f  X  n  X   X  a 1 a  X  X  X  4  X  where: a is the output of the activation function, whose values result in the interval (0,1).

The learning procedure is conducted using the backpropaga-tion algorithm ( Rumelhart et al., 1986 ), which consists of a gradient descent procedure to search the synaptic weights which minimize the output errors.

The fi rst step calculates the output from each unit of the neural network by starting from the input layer and propagating forward through the hidden layer to the output layer. The synaptic weights of each neuron are updated at each iteration k by using what is termed the  X  delta rule  X  , originally formulated by Widrow and Hoff (1960) to neural networks of only one layer, given by Eq. (5) .
W where: W are the neuron synaptic weights;  X  is the magnitude of the learning rate; e are the errors of the network output; derivatives of the activation function of the neuron; and P are the inputs to each neuron.

The output errors, when the neurons are not in the output layer, are found from the sum of the products of the weights in the following layers with the derivatives of the corresponding activation functions, and with the errors of that layer, according to Eq. (6) ( Rumelhart et al., 1986 ). e  X  where: e h is the error in the hidden layer; W s are the synaptic weights in the subsequent layer; e s areerrorsinthesubsequentlayer;  X  are derivative of the activation function in the subsequent layer.
Since the calculation error in hidden layers depends only on the properties and errors in subsequent layers, its calculation begins at the output layer and progresses backward through the hidden layer to the input layer.

Excessive training of an ANN can result in over-fi tting, losing the capacity to generalize the results obtained. The best-kno-wn way to avoid over-fi tting by interrupting training too soon is by cross-validation. Model training then requires three data sequences for the purposes of (i) training; (ii) validation; (iii) veri fi cation. The validation series, in which model performance is evaluated at each iteration of the training procedure using the training series, serves to identify where the performance coef cient begins to diverge and training is then interrupted, since this divergence signals the onset of over-fi tting. The ability of the model to generalize is then evaluated using the veri fi cation sequence.

An adapted version of cross-validation was used in which all iterations are completed. The synaptic weights corresponding to the point of best performance in the validation series are then retained to form the resulting network in each training procedure.
This avoids the possible problem of oscillation in the performance coef fi cient occurring in the validation series, which could cause training to end prematurely. Visual inspection ( Fig. 2 ) is important for verifying the technique  X  s progress.

Based on earlier results, the ANN con fi guration was de fi follows: (i) The number of realizations in the simulations was set to 30.
This was taken from work by Dornelles et al. (2013) , who concluded after various tests that it is a large enough number to give good results in hydrological simulation; (ii) The maximum number of iterations in each realization was de fi ned by a number of tests using each hydrological series (iii) The number of neurons in the hidden layer varied according (iv) In general, each training series was between 40 and 50% of
AIC  X  nd ln ep  X  2 np  X  7  X  where nd is the number of data values, ep is the standard error and np is the number of models parameters. 3.3.2. Proposed method for simplifying hydrological ANNs The method set out in this paper for simplifying hydrological
ANN models is based on reducing network dimensionality by small perturbations on input-variable sequences, verifying the contribution of each variable to the simulation, and excluding the least in fl uential variables according to a threshold. The ANN is simpli fi ed in stages similar to step-by-step methods, but with much less computational effort ( Fig. 3 ).

The initial set of input variables was chosen by calculating the linear correlation coef fi cient of each with the fl ow to be estimated, adopting limits of 0.5 for fl ows and 0.3 for rainfall. There were two reasons for choosing low limits for correlations when choosing the input variables: (i) to avoid excluding at too early a stage any variable with low linear correlation with output, but which might have a strong non-linear relation with it; (ii) to test the ability of the proposed method to simplify.

Taking account of exploratory analysis and data availability, various combinations of input variables were tested for the four basins, some of which are given in Table 2 . In general, all simulations had the following variables as input data: mean daily rainfall over the basin, interpolated by the natural neighbour method, for days preceding the data of simulation (varying from two to fi ve days, according to basin size); exponentially-weighted rainfall; and fl ow at the nearest gauging stations (usually upstream) on days preceding the date of simulation (varying from one to fi ve days, according to basin size). Although many of these variables were highly inter-correlated, all were included in the initial con fi guration precisely for testing and analyzing how well the procedure could select only the variables most important for the system being modelled.

In total, seven combinations were tested with different amounts of input variables (12 to 24), and the difference between the number of inputs of each combination is generally justi fi ed by the drainage area and the time delay observed in the basin analyzed. The combination 2 (Ponte M X stica  X  Qs 1 ) was the one with the largest data set with 2174 records, between 1989 and 1995. In turn, the combination 1 (Ponte the inclusion of fl ow data from the Turcato basin ( Q 5 )andtheneed for coincidence of fl ow observation periods.

Eq. (8) gives the fi lter for exponentially-weighted decay of rainfall. The variable generated by the fi lter was used because of its high correlation ( 4 0.75) with observed fl ow at all gauging sites. Fig. 4 shows its behaviour superimposed on the hydrological regime at Santo  X ngelo, and illustrating the similarity in pattern between it and the output variable.
 Pf  X  X  t  X  1  X   X  X  Pf  X  X  t 1  X   X  P t  X  8  X  where: P ( f ) t is the exponentially-weighted rainfall at time t ; coef fi cient with values between 0 and 1; P ( f ) t 1 is the rainfall at time t 1, and P t is rainfall observed at time t .
The coef fi cient  X  was derived from the correlation r between the fi ltered variable and the fl ow to be modeled, the value taken being that which maximized r in each data-set. The greater its value, the smaller is the time-dependence in the fi lter: i.e., the fi ltered rainfall gives smaller weight to rainfall on the preceding day than to rainfall on the current day. The smaller basins have short memory, with smaller time-dependence and a larger value for the coef fi cient  X  . Table 3 gives values of  X  used in the present work.

After selecting the input variables for the initial ANN-base hydrological model, the simulation process began. The quantita-tive evaluation of model performance used the following indica-tors: (i) the Nash  X  Sutcliffe coef fi cient (NS); (ii) the linear correlation coef fi cient r; (iii) Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSE); (iv) the parsimony coef fi cient, AIC. Model performance with each combination of input variables was also evaluated qualitatively by analyzing observed and calculated hydrographs.

Having calibrated the synaptic weights, the next step was to evaluate the contribution of each input node by perturbing each variable  X  s record one at a time, with the remaining records held fi xed. A number of tests were made to fi nd the most appropriate kind of perturbation to use, particularly with regard to their magnitudes; different series of perturbations, both deterministic and random, were tested, with magnitudes both large and small.
Variables identi fi ed as less in fl uential were excluded from tests, using the methodology described below. The training procedure and veri fi cation of results was then repeated. The better the performance of the simpli fi ed model, the more appropriate was the magnitude of the perturbation imposed on the original data.
The initial experiments suggested that small deterministic pertur-bations should be used to disturb the input variables, with the original data multiplied by coef fi cients ranging from 0.95 to 1.05 in steps of 0.005, giving 20 perturbed series for each input variable. The perturbed values therefore did not differ greatly from the original, thus reducing the risk of discrepant or infeasible input values which might invalidate the analysis.

Having superimposed the perturbation series on the input variables, they were then fed into the previously calibrated model, and measures of the revised model performance were stored by taking the absolute difference between the RMSE of the original model and the RMSE of the model given the perturbed inputs.
Thus 20 values of this measure of the revised model performance were calculated for each input variable. The greater the change in performance, the greater is the contribution of the variable to the ANN.

The contribution index CI of each input variable is the mean of the absolute differences in the RMSE value (Eq. (9) ). Variables were then put in increasing order according to their CI. Dividing the CI by the sum of the CI over all inputs gave the relative contribution index RCI. It is considered that the signi fi input variable is measured by the change in the model perfor-mance with disturbance in the values of this variable while keeping undisturbed the other variables.
 CI x  X 
 X  the RMSE value of the original model; RMSE i is the RMSE value of the model when given the perturbed input variable x , with values of i going from 1 to p , and p is the number of perturbed series, in this case 20.
 be identi fi ed below which input variables are less in fl hypothetical example is given in Table 4 in which the exclusion threshold is 10%. Variables A and B are those with least in the ANN model, having RCI 2.1% and 7.6%, respectively. Accumulat-ing their RCI values, the variables A and B have 9.7% of the variability in the results after perturbations, a value below the threshold set so that these variables are excluded.

Using a high threshold, however, can lead to important variables being excluded from the model which would otherwise contribute signi fi cantly to the output fl ows. It is therefore desirable to set the threshold below 10% and restart the procedure, giving a new round of exclusion and simpli fi cation of the model. This iterative procedure reduces the risk of excluding an important variable and allows the evolution of model performance to be monitored as the dimensionality of the ANN model is reduced. In the present work, the threshold was set at 5%. The procedure is stopped when there is no variable with RCI lower than the threshold.
 importance as measure by RCI, in order to exclude inputs and simplify the ANN, was effected by analyzing the evolution of hydrological model performance and by comparing this procedure with the method which calculates the sum of products of the synaptic weights: namely the Overall Connection Weights method (OCW), which Olden et al. (2004) found to be ef fi cient for ordering input variables according to their importance for modelling.
Comparison of the orderings obtained by using RCI and OCW consisted of two steps. In the fi rst, similarities and divergences between the positions of input variables in the two orderings were noted; in the second, ANN performance was calculated using variables selected by using the two methods OCW and RCI.
The following method was used to identify similarities between the two rankings: (i) the mean absolute differences in position of the input variables in the two rankings were calculated; (ii) an index was calculated  X  the Similarity Rankings Index SRI, given by
Eq. (10)  X  which measured the similarity between the two ordered lists; (iii) a Monte Carlo randomization procedure was used to obtain 5000 permuted random orders; (iv) the SRI was calculated between the 5000 randomized orders and the order found using
OCW; (v) the similarity between orders given by the OCW and RCI methods was calculated by comparing the observed SRI and the 5000 SRI values obtained by Monte Carlo, using a signi fi 0.025.

SRI  X  1 md d where: SRI is the Index of similarity between the orderings; md is the mean of the absolute differences in position of input variables in the two orderings; d max is the maximum value of md which can be found between the two orderings (equal to n /2) where n is the number of input variables.

The SRI varies from zero, when ord erings are extremely different, to one, when they are identical. The Monte Carlo rand-omization procedure was used to fi ndamoresecurethresholdby which it would be possible to conclude whether orderings are similar ordifferentatarigoroussigni fi cance level 0.025. Thus if the observed
SRI between the two orderings was greater than the SRI that was exceeded by a proportion  X   X  0.025 of the 5000 randomizations, the two orderings can be taken as really similar ( Fig. 5 ).
Finally, it was performed a comparison between the proposed method RCI and a traditional method of selecting variables, the
Forward Stepwise Addition method (FSA). The ANN performance was compared using variables selected by using the two methods FSA and RCI.

In the Forward Stepwise Addition method, the input variables are used separately to train the ANN, choosing the one that resulted in a better performance model. It is started another round of training for the selection of the second input variable, keeping fi xed the variable chosen in the previous round. This procedure is repeated until it results an RNA with better performance or a more parsimonious one. 4. Results and discussion
Results obtained in this work will be presented and discussed in terms of the following topics: (i) evolution of model perfor-mance during the ANN simpli fi cation procedure; (ii) selection of the best con fi gurations for simulating fl ows at the four gauging sites; (iii) presentation of hydrographs obtained with the selected simpli fi ed con fi gurations; (iv) behaviour of the RCI of main input variables to each model; (v) relation between orderings found using RCI and OCW.

Table 5 summarizes the performance of simulations during the process of ANN simpli fi cation, showing the fi nal number of input variables and the number of exclusion runs needed. Best results were found with the larger basins  X  Ponte M X stica, Qs 1 , (9426 km and Santo  X ngelo, Qs  X  , (5414 km  X  )  X  with NS coef fi cients greater than 0.9 in almost all con fi gurations obtained in the ANN simpli-fi cation procedure. In the smaller basins  X  Tabo X o, Qs 4 , (80 km and Turcato, Qs 5 , (19.4 km  X  )  X  performance was less good, with mean NS coef fi cients between 0.682 and 0.824. The dif fi modeling the hydrological response of small basins partly results from the fact that they are in fl uenced by phenomena that occur at a time-scale of less than one day, which adversely affects the calculation of mean daily fl ows.

Fig. 6 shows the evolution of model performance during the process for excluding variables and simplifying ANNs which gave the four combinations, shown in the shaded areas of Table 5 , selected for each of the fl ow gauging sites. When selecting the combinations, the representativity of the series used for network training (i.e., the length of records) was taken into account, in addition to performance. Fig. 6 also de fi nes the points in the procedure where the most parsimonious model was found using the AIC criterion and the best con fi guration as determined by the NS and RMSE. In all the simulations, the dimensions of the ANNs were reduced until there were only a few input variables, with no input giving an RCI lower than the 5% threshold. It can be seen that in all combinations the initial con fi guration was superseded, whether by the criterion of parsimony or by performance, by at least one simpler network con fi guration.

In general, reducing ANN dimensionality led to an increase in NS coef fi cient and a reduction in RMSE, indicating improved model performance during simpli fi cation. This con fi rms the initial hypoth-esis that an excess of variables can weaken the performance of ANN models, and making it impossible t o make any interpretation based on the model.

In Combination 2 ( Qs 1 , Ponte M X stica, 9426 km  X  ), the best perfor-mance was obtained after the fourth exclusion round when the model had eight input variables requiring 81 internal connections (para-meters),whentheNSwas0.941andRMSE64.7m  X  /s. The most parsimonious con fi guration was found after the last exclusion run, with only six input variables (49 connections): NS was 0.939 and RMSE 65.4 m  X  /s. In all, six runs excluded 16 variables, reducing the number of connections from 529 to 49 without loss of model quality ( Fig. 6 ).

In Combination 3 ( Qs  X  , Santo  X ngelo, 5414 km  X  ) model perfor-mance improved during the entire simpli fi cation process. The NS coef fi cient increased from 0.894 to 0.944 and the RMSE fell from variables were excluded, reducing the number of internal connec-tions from 169 to only 25. The last con fi guration was the best and most parsimonious, since it performed best with the smallest number of parameters.

Combination 6 ( Qs 4 , Tabo X o, 80 km  X  ) also showed a general increase in performance during model simpli fi cation, with NS coef fi cient increasing from 0.817 in the initial con fi inputs, 361 internal connections) to 0.830 in the most simpli and parsimonious con fi guration (4 inputs, 25 connections). The RMSE also improved, falling from 0.776 to 0.749 m  X  /s. The best con fi guration was obtained after the fourth exclusion run, when the ANN had six input variables and 49 internal connections. At that point in the process, the NS coef fi cient was 0.834 and the
RMSE 0.738 m  X  /s. Also in Combination 7 ( Qs 5 , Turcato, 19.4 km model performance evolved to the penultimate con fi guration (the best and most parsimonious) giving an ANN with nine input variables (100 connections) with NS coef fi cient 0.717 and RMSE 0.268 m  X  /s ( Fig. 6 ).

It can also be seen that, for Combinations 2 and 6, performance oscillates, worsening in one round and improving in the next. It is therefore not advisable to interrupt the simpli fi cation process solely on the basis of reduced performance. It is better to end the process at the point where all input variables have RCI above the de fi ned threshold, as in the present study.

Figs. 7  X  10 show the hydrographs obtained in Combinations 2, 3, 6 and 7 respectively, using the most parsimonious con fi tions. Two points emerge from the hydrographs: (i) modelling of recession periods was less satisfactory in Combinations 6 and 7, since the daily time-scale is not adequate for describing hydro-logical processes in such small basins; (ii) under-estimation of largest fl ows is more evident in Combinations 2 and 3.
The results can be regarded as satis factory, however, particularly when compared with those given by physical models of the same basins given by Silva (2011) , with similar sampling periods and using the same daily rainfall data interpolated by the natural neighbour method. The model used in that study was the model IPH II ( Tucci and Clarke, 1980 ). It is a lumped rainfall-runoff model with speci functions for initial losses by evaporation and interception, and with excess rainfall separated into surface runoff and Hortonian in tion to subsurface fl ow. Table 6 compares the performance of this model with that of the most parsimonious ANN model.

The analysis of RCI behaviour during the simpli fi cation process of the four selected ANN combinations is important since it casts light on how the model functions. Fig. 11 illustrates this behaviour and identi fi es the most important variables in each simulation.
Table 7 gives a synthesis of the most important variables in the four selected combinations together with the hydrological pro-cesses described by them.

In Combination 2 ( Qs 1 , Ponte M X stica, 9426 km  X  ), the most important variable throughout almost all the simpli fi cation period was Q  X  ( t ), the fl ow at the Santo  X ngelo gauging station at time t , with RCI varying from 21.8% (initial con fi guration with 22 vari-ables) to 30.8% in the con fi guration with 8 variables ( Fig. 11 ). The mean RCI for this variable was 26.9%. The second most outstanding variable in the simulation was Q  X  ( t 1), which began as the most important and then maintained second place. The RCI of this variable oscillated between 22.2% and 28.2% with mean 25.6%. The other four variables with marked importance were: (i) P (4 d ); (ii)
Q  X  of the RCI in the fi rst con fi guration, and gradually increased during simpli fi cation.

The initial con fi guration of Combination 2 had 12 fl ow inputs and 10 rainfall inputs. In the early runs, the fl ow inputs to the ANN were basically simpli fi ed, with only four such inputs left at the end of the process ( Q  X  at times t , t 1, t 2 and t 4). These variables totalled 62% of accumulated RCI during the fi rst con fi guration and increased to 75% after the second exclusion run, when the ANN had 13 variables. This marked increase in the early runs is due to the exclusion of other variables containing similar hydrological information as those retained in it. The same happened with the accumulated rainfall variable P (4 d ), which incorporated the RCI of the other two accumulated rainfall variables when they were excluded from the model, with RCI increasing from 5.2% to 17.3%.
At the end of the simpli fi cation process, the inputs related to fl ow in Combination 2 totalled 76% of the RCI contribution, whiles the rainfall variables gave accumulated RCI of 24%. This is because rainfall data, although describing the input of water to the whole of the contributing basin, involve only a part of the hydrological cycle giving rise to river fl ows. By comparison, upstream at the Santo  X ngelo gauging station, which has 57% of the drainage area upstream of the Ponte M X stica station, give at least a partial description of all the hydrological processes giving rise to river fl ow, incorporating initial losses by interception, evaporation and in fi ltration, augmented by subsurface fl ow and stored soil water (see Table 7 ). The use of fl ow data from gauging stations whose drainage areas are nested within the drainage area above Santo  X ngelo (Potiribu, Tabo X o and Turcato) does not improve model performance, which is understandable since the information that they contain is already included in downstream fl ow data.
In Combination 3 ( Qs  X  ,Santo X ngelo,5414km  X  ), the two most important variables during the short simpli fi cation process were the exponentially-weighted rainfall P ( f ), and the fl ow Q 1
M X stica station at time t .TheRCIofthe P ( f ) variable, which was the most important in the model when the simpli fi cation process ended, remained stable during the proc ess between 33.7% and 36.4%. The second variable, Q 1 ( t ), had RCI varying between 29% (in the last con fi guration) and 44.3% (penultimate con fi guration), with a fall of 15.3% after the third and last exclusion round ( Fig. 11 ). The other two notable variables were P ( r )and P (4 d ), with RCI less than 20% during the whole simpli fi cation process. Together, the four inputs added to
The growth in RCI of the variables P ( r ) and P (4 d ) in the con fi guration of Combination 3 ( Fig. 11 ), is due principally to the exclusion of other input variables containing similar hydrological information, such as P (3 d ) and P (5 d ). At the end of the simpli tion process, rainfall-related inputs totalled 71% of the RCI con-tribution, whilst the fl ow variable contributed only 29% of accumulated RCI. This differs from what was found at Ponte
M X stica for Combination 2. There, fl ow variables were the more important for hydrological modelling by adding more information about the water cycle, although not for the whole of the basin like rainfall. In Combination 3 (Santo  X ngelo, 5414 km  X  ), the that are used are from downstream (Ponte M X stica, 9426 km thus do not describe only what occurred in the upstream basin but also the hydrological processes in the incremental part of the basin. In this case, rainfall data add more precision to the model since they better describe upstream processes.

It should be mentioned that, even using upstream fl ow data (Potiribu, Q  X  , 629 km  X  , and Turcato, Q 5 ,19km  X  ) to simulate ( Qs  X  ) at the Santo  X ngelo gauging station (5414 km  X  ), as in
Combination 4, the rainfall variables play an important role in the model. The explanation lies in the drainage area above the upstream site which is only 12% of the basin above Santo  X ngelo, and is unrepresentative of the whole. This proportion is much less than that for Qs 1 (57%). Thus in the fi rst simulation (Ponte M X stica,
Qs 1 ), the nearest upstream fl ow records incorporate a signi part of the physical processes governing the hydrological regime at the more downstream site, conferring more information to the fl ow data than to the rainfall data. So in the second simulation (Santo  X ngelo, Qs  X  ), upstream fl ow records incorporate only a small part of the physical processes giving rise to fl ows at the simulated site. More information is contained in rainfall data which, although they are daily totals and thus generalize the physical process, extend to all the upstream drainage area.
Regarding Combination 6 ( Qs 4 , Tabo X o, 80 km  X  ), four variables stand out in the RCI: Q  X  ( t ), Q 5 ( t ), P ( f ) and Q Q  X  ( t ), the fl ow at the downstream Potiribu site at time t , was the most important during almost all the whole of the variable exclusion process with mean RCI 32.5%, varying between 25.8% in the fi rst con fi guration and 37.3% in the fi nal. The second most important variable is fl ow at the upstream Turcato gauging site, Q ( t ), varying between 13.8% and 36.4%, with mean RCI 28.3% ( Fig. 11 ). Of the four most important variables, Q 5 ( t ) the one with greatest variation in RCI was Q 5 ( t ), the fl ow at the Turcato gauging site at time t , being more important or less so according to model characteristics though the simpli fi cation process. The other three inputs obtained more stable RCI contributions with smaller oscillations. In the fi rst con fi guration with 18 inputs the accumu-lated RCI of the four variables was 76.4%, generally increasing as the number of inputs lessened.

In the two fi rst exclusion runs, the variable Q 5 ( t ) showed great oscillation in RCI value. The reason for this is related to the variables excluded in them. U to the second con fi guration, the variables Q 5 at times t , t 1 and t 2 were included as inputs. Their total RCI was 30.1%. When the inputs at times t 1 and t 2were excluded, Q 5 ( t ) was given an increase from 13.8% to 31,4%, incorporating the relative contributions of the excluded variables. When all three inputs were present in the model, the contribution of the hydrological processes inherent in the upstream fl including surface and subsurface runoff as a function of initial losses by interception, evaporation and in fi ltration, and soil water storage, was shared between all the variables containing such information. When the redundant variables were excluded, the contribution of the one remaining is increased, being linked to the contribution of physical processes integrated to form the upstream fl ow record.

At the end of the simpli fi cation process, the input related to upstream fl ow ( Q 5 at time t ) accounted for 33.5% of total RCI. The two inputs referring to the nearest downstream fl ow record ( Q times t and t 2) together accounted for 51.2% of total RCI, while the variable P ( f ), derived from rainfall, stayed at 15.3% of RCI.
In Combination 7 ( Qs 5 , Turcato, 19.4 km  X  ), the variable standing out most was Q  X  ( t ), as in the preceding simulation (Tabo X o, 80 km  X  ), as seen from Fig. 11 . The RCI for this variable oscillated between 46.7%, in the fi rst con fi guration to 62.6% in the fourth (with 10 inputs), with mean 55% in the six exclusion runs. Other variables with reasonable RCI indices were, in order of importance, Q  X  ( t 1) with 12.2%, P ( f ) with 7.3%, Q  X  ( t ) with 5%, Q and Q 4 ( t 1) with 3.4%.

The reason why rainfall variables do not stand out in these last two combinations is related to basin size. In small basins like Tabo X o and Turcato, concentration time and basin memory are substantially reduced, with duration much less than one day.
Hence variables measuring accumulated rainfall, which partially represent soil water storage, in fi ltration capacity and antecedent conditions of surface and subsurface fl ow on the preceding days, do not adequately account for current fl ow.

Another relevant issue requiring comment and justi fi cation con-cerns the importance of downstream fl ows. Flows recorded at the
Potiribu gauging site (629 km  X  )isstronglyrelatedtothe fl recorded at Tabo X o (80 km  X  )atthesametime: fi rst, because the incremental area between the two gauging sites is small. Further-more, the concentration times of both basins are less than a day. Thus the fl ow observed at the two sites does not show any time lag, making it therefore ef fi cient to use fl ow at the downstream site.
It is stressed that the inputs from mean daily rainfall at times t , t 1upto t n preceding days used in ANN-based hydrological simulations by (for example) Jain et al. (2004) , Shamseldin (1997) ,
Sajikumar and Thandaveswara (1999) , do not contribute greatly to simulations reported in this paper. Even in previous tests in which the variable P ( f ) was excluded, the importance of mean daily rainfall inputs was not signi fi cant.

In can therefore be concluded that in hydrological simulation methods that are strictly numerical and without physical basis, such as ANNs, it is necessary to extract the information from variables most closely related to the fl ows that are to be simulated, such as exponentially-weighted rainfall P ( f ), which was the only variable present in all con fi gurations obtained during model simpli fi cation. This variable, which most closely measures condi-tions of basin antecedent wetness, gives the ANN the capacity to simulate fl ow observed in rivers, being more important than the  X  raw  X  rainfall data.

Regarding the comparison of the ordering of variables obtained by RCI after perturbing inputs, and the ordering obtained from the sum of products of internal ANN weights by OCW, interesting results were found which validate the simpli fi cation method explored in this paper. Using Monte Carlo simulations it was found that in 89% of cases the two ordering methods showed similarities that were not explained by chance, con fi rming that the two procedures give similar results when detecting the most important variables.

In Combination 2, for the Ponte M X stica gauging site ( Qs two orderings showed many similarities, as shown by Monte Carlo method, with mean SRI 0.846 in the seven con fi gurations tested. It is concluded that the two ordering procedures are similar up to a signi fi cance probability of 0.025. Only in the fi rst con fi guration with 22 input variables and SRI 0.653 (the lowest value found in this combination), a Monte Carlo comparison of the two orderings rejected the null hypothesis (H0) that the two orderings are different ( Fig. 12 ). Throughout the whole ANN simpli fi procedure for this combination, the three inputs with greatest RCI are also those for which the OCW was greatest.

SRI was slightly less than in the preceding case with mean index of 0.735 in the four con fi gurations tested. It can therefore be concluded that in all combinations tested at signi fi cance level 0.025, the two orderings are similar. In the fi rst con fi inputs) the observed SRI between the orderings was 0.75, whilst the SRI (  X   X  0.025) was 0.59. Also, in the second con fi inputs), the observed SRI was 0.70, and the SRI (  X   X  0.025) was 0.65. Amongst the variables standing out in this model (Combina-tion 3), the greatest divergence is related to the variable P (4 d ), which showed no great importance when evaluated by internal weights, despite showing a large RCI value. The opposite occurred in the case of Q 1 ( t 3), where RCI values were low, although internal connections were  X  strong  X  .
 tion 6, the Tabo X o gauging site ( Qs 4 ), was 0.679. In only two of the seven con fi gurations were the orderings found to differ at sig-ni fi cance level 0.025. This occurred in the second con fi (with 12 inputs), in which observed SRI was 0.528 whilst the SRI (  X   X  0.025) was 0.583, and in the sixth con fi guration ( when the observed SRI was 0.556 and the SRI (  X   X  0.025) 0.777. In the remaining con fi gurations, the observed SRI was always greater than or equal to the SRI (  X   X  0.025). For this model the two most important variables in all ANN con fi gurations were the same in the two orderings, with total agreement in their positions. The largest discrepancies are related to variables with little importance in the model, located in the lower parts of the table of orderings. In the fi nal con fi guration with four input variables, the ordering was identical in the comparison between methods, with SRI equal to one.
 mean SRI was 0.512. The orderings showed their greatest differences in this model, as in four of the six con fi gurations they were considered to be different, with observed SRI less than the SRI (  X   X  0.025). Even so, both methods classi fi ed the variable Q most important in all con fi gurations, with few differences amongst the most important variables.
 selected for RCI and Forward Stepwise Addition (FSA) methods. In
Combination 2, for the Ponte M X stica gauging site ( Qs 1 ), of the six input variables selected in the fi nal model with the RCI method, three were selected by the FSA method. These are: P ( f ) Q
Q  X  ( t 1). In Combination 3, for the Santo  X ngelo gauging site ( Qs of the four input variables resulting in the fi nal model with the RCI method, two coincided with the FSA method, P ( f ) and Q 1 variables. In Combination 6, for the Tabo X o gauging site ( Qs the four input variables resulting in the fi nal model with the RCI method, two coincided with the FSA method, the variables of P ( f ) and Q 5 ( t ). Finally, in Combination 7, for the Turcato gauging site ( Qs 5 ), three variables were selected in common: Q 3 ( t 1), Q Q 4 ( t 1).
 variables selected by the three variable selection procedures (RCI, OCW and FSA). The most important variables were selected in each of the three procedures as done in the fi rst con (with the complete model and all the input variables). In all combinations, it was found at least one divergent variable. methods resulted in similar performance measures, with a slight advantage in favour of selection based on RCI. In Combinations 1 and 2 (Ponte M X stica  X  Qs 1 ), 3 and 4 (Santo  X ngelo  X  Qs found to be more ef fi cient, with larger NS coef fi cients and smaller RMSEs.

 X ngelo  X  Qs  X  ), selection based on RCI proved to be more ef larger NS coef fi cients and smaller RMSEs coef fi cients. However, with the Combinations 5 and 6 (Tabo X o  X  Qs 4 )and7(Turcato  X  Qs
FSA and OCW methods gave better performance than the alternative method for selection/exclusion of variables.

Based therefore on the similarity of orderings and the compar-ison of performance when simplifying ANN models, it is concluded that the proposed method is ef fi cient and gives results even more consistent than the FSA and OCW methods. The advantage of using the RCI index with perturbations to input variables with the ANN already trained, is that it is possible to obtain a statistic that allows the model to be simpli fi ed by a threshold, without the need for retraining. This makes the method more ef fi cient computationally.
In addition, the approach described in this paper, with a cut-off threshold, reduces the likelihood of excluding any variable that could be more important in other model con fi gurations, since the contributions of inputs shows oscillations that are dif fi foresee. Added to all this, the present method of simpli fi allows the evolution of ANN performance to be monitored as simpli fi cation proceeds, showing whether the simpli fi ed model performs better than the original with a much reduced number of parameters.

In the Olden and Jackson (2002) method, it is also possible to set up a signi fi cance level for excluding variables or internal ANN connections, by permuting model outputs with successive initi-alizations of the training process. The disadvantage is that the procedure must be repeated many times, giving a heavy computa-tional load. Furthermore, in the Olden and Jackson (2002) method, the ef fi ciency at excluding variables or connections was not evaluated in terms of the resulting model performance. There are therefore no guarantees that the simpli fi cation resulted in a better-quality model (this is illustrated in Table 8 of this paper).
In the FSA method, although the performance of the obtained models has also been satisfactory, the computational effort was much higher than the other two methods, taking into account their need for successive training, with alternating variables for choosing the best combination of inputs. In Combination 2, for example, it was performed 117 training procedures to obtain a model with six inputs from twenty-two initial variables. The method using RCI index, in turn, was performed using only six training procedures.

Finally, regarding the threshold to be set for excluding variables through the use of RCI, it is suggested that low values be set, similar to those used here (5%), as a guarantee that all important variables are retained in the model. If higher thresholds are set, simpli fi cation is quicker, often with just one exclusion run, but the risk of eliminating a variable which might stand out in another
ANN con fi guration increases, adversely affecting model perfor-mance. As ANN simpli fi cation proceeds, a variable which has hitherto shown no great contribution to model output may become important because redundant infor mation has been eliminated. Thus the approach proposed here, requiring several simulation runs of training and veri fi cation, is appropriate and can be validated by meansoftheresultsobtained. 5. Conclusions
In general, the simpli fi cation of ANN hydrological models by excluding input variables and reducing the number of hidden-layer neurons in proportion, leads to an increase in the NS coef reduction in RMSE, con fi rming that too many variables can weaken the performance of ANN simulations. The potential of ANN models is realized by eliminating unnecessary and/or redundant variables.
In Combination 2 ( Qs 1 , Ponte M X stica, 9426 km  X  ), the best perfor-mance was obtained with eight input variables (NS  X  RMSE  X  64.7 m  X  /s). The most parsimonious con fi guration, with only six inputs, had NS coef fi cient 0.939 and RMSE 65.4 m  X  /s. In all, 16 input variables were excluded in six runs, reducing the number of connections from 529 to only 49 with no reduction in model quality. In Combination 3 ( Qs  X  ,Santo X ngelo,5414km  X  ) model performance improved throughout the sim ulation process. The NS coef fi increased from 0.894 to 0.944 and the RMSE decreased from 70 to 51 m  X  /s. Twelve initial inputs were excluded in only three runs, reducing the number of internal connections for 169 to just 25. Combination 6 ( Qs 4 ,Tabo X o,80km  X  ) also showed evolution in NS coef fi cient, increasing from 0.817 (18 inputs) to 0.830 (4 inputs) in the most simpli fi ed and parsimonious con fi guration. Also in Combi-nation 7 ( Qs 5 ,Turcato,19.4km  X  ), model performance improved up to the penultimate con fi guration (best and most parsimonious, NS  X  0.717; RMSE  X  0.268 m  X  /s),whentheANNhadnineinput variables (100 connections).

By calculating the RCI and simplifying ANN models, it was possible to identify the variables m ost important for each simulation, as well as the dominant hydrological processes and their spatial scale. In Combination 2 ( Qs 1 , Ponte M X stica, 9426 km  X  the most important variable during the simpli fi cation process was Q  X  ( t ), the fl ow at the Santo  X ngelo gauging station at time t ,withRCI varying from 21.8% to 30.8%. When the simpli fi cation process terminated, inputs related to upstream fl ow added up to 76% of the RCI contribution, whilst rainfall-related inputs contributed only 24%. Although the spatial extent of upstream fl ow data was restricted to 57% of the basin area simulated, representation of the hydrological processes that determine river fl ow is much more complete, incor-porating initial losses through interception, evaporation and in tion, and supplied by subsurface fl ow and soil water storage. Rainfall data, on the other hand, involve only a part of the water cycle giving rise to river fl ows, despite contributing all the input of water to the basin.

In Combination 3 ( Qs  X  , Santo  X ngelo, 5414 km  X  ), the two most important variables were exponentially-weighted rainfall P ( f ) and fl ow at the Ponte M X stica gauging site at time t , Q 1 ( t ). When the simpli fi cation process ended, rainfall-related inputs added to 71% of the RCI contribution whilst the fl ow variable contributed only 29% to accumulated RCI. In this combination, the fl ow used was from a downstream site (Ponte M X stica, 9426 km  X  ), representing not only what occurred in the upstream basin, but also the hydrological processes in the incremental part of the basin. Here, therefore, rainfall data contribute most to model performance.
In the last two simulations, Combination 6 ( Qs 4 ,Tabo X o,80km and Combination 7 ( Qs 5 ,Turcato,19.4km  X  ), the variable Q the Potiribu gauging site at time t , was most important, with mean RCI 32.5% and 55%, respectively. In both simulations, fl ow variables contributed most to the modeling of output fl ows. The explanation for this is related to basin area. In small basins such as Tabo X o (80 km and Turcato (19.4 km  X  ), concentration time and basin memory are substantially smaller, less than a day.

Another conclusion concerning the contribution of input vari-ables is that the inputs of mean daily rainfall which are frequently used in ANN hydrological simulation did not prove to be very important for the models. It is concluded that hydrological simulation methods that are purely numerical and without phy-sical basis, such as ANNs, should extract information most closely related to fl ow, such as exponentially-weighted rainfall P ( f ), which was the only variable which stood out in con fi gurations of all seven models. This variable summarizes most completely the antecedent moisture conditions in the drainage basin, giving the
ANN the potential to simulate river fl ow, and being more impor-tant than  X  raw  X  rainfall data.

To validate the simpli fi cation procedure and to analyze the resulting model performance, the orderings obtained by RCI after perturbation of inputs were compared with the orderings obtained by the Overall Connecting Weights (OCW) procedure based on the sum of internal ANN weights. From Monte Carlo simulations it was concluded that in 89% of cases the orderings given by the two methods were too similar to have occurred by chance: i.e., it was con fi rmed that both procedures satisfactorily identify the most important variables.

Comparisons of the three methods, RCI, OCW and FSA, showed a slight advantage in favour of the RCI-based method. In the
Forward Stepwise Addition (FSA) method, although the perfor-mance of the obtained models has also been satisfactory, the computational effort was much greater than to the other two methods.

Furthermore, it was concluded that the proposed method is ef fi cient and gives more consistent results than the OCW method, regarded by Olden et al. (2004) as the most appropriate for ordering input variables according to their importance for ANN modelling. The advantage of using the RCI index is that it is possible to obtain a statistic which allows the model to be simpli fi ed in terms of a threshold, without the need to undertake new training. This makes the method computationally more ef fi cient. Depending on the threshold that determines exclusion, the possibility is reduced of eliminating a variable found to be important in subsequent model con fi gurations. Added to this, the present simpli fi cation procedure allows the evolution in ANN performance to be monitored, during the simpli fi cation process.
In conclusion, it is emphasized that simplifying ANNs gives a clearer understanding of how the network is functioning and identi fi es which variables are most signi fi cant for determining the composition of the simulated hydrograph. Reducing ANN com-plexity allows the researcher to follow more easily how changes in measured values in fl uence output fl ows.
