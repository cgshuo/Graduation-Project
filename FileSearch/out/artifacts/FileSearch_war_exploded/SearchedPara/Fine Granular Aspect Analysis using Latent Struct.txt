 Online reviews have been a major resource from which users may find opinions or comments on the products or services they want to consume. How-ever, users sometimes might be overwhelmed, and not be able to read reviews one by one when facing a considerably large number of reviews, and they may be not be satisfied by only being served with document-level reviews statistics (that is, the num-ber of reviews with 1-star, 2-star, . . . , respectively). Aspect-level review analysis may be alternative for addressing this issue as aspect-specific opinions may more clearly, explicitly, and completely describe the quality of a product from different properties.
Our goal is to discover informative sentences that are consistent with the overall rating of a review, and simultaneously, to perform sentiment analysis at as-pect level. Notice, that a review with a high rating (say, 4/5 stars) may contain both negative and posi-tive opinions, and the same to a review with a very low rating (say, 1/2 star). From our point of view, each review has a set of sentences that are informa-tive and coherent to its overall rating. To perform fine granular sentiment analysis, the first step is to discover such coherent content.

Many information needs require the systems to perform fine granular sentiment analysis. Aspect-level sentiment analysis may be more useful for users to have a global picture of opinions on the product X  X  properties. Furthermore, different users may have different preferences on different aspects of a product. Taking the reviews on mobile phones as an example, female users may focus more on the appearance while male users may lay more emphasis on the hardware configuration; younger users prefer to the app or game resources while older users may just pay attention to the basic function of calling or messaging.

In recent years, there has been much work focused multilevel sentiment classification using structural learning models. Yi (2007) extends the standard conditional random fields to model the local senti-ment flow. Ryan (2007) proposed structured models for fine-to-coarse sentiment analysis. Oscar (2011) proposed to discover fine-grained sentiment with hidden-state CRF(Quattoni et al., 2007). Yessenali-na (2010) deployed the framework of latent struc-tural SVMs(Yu and Joachims., 2009) for multilevel sentiment classification. As for aspect level rating, ranking, or summarization, Benjamin(2007) em-ployed the good grief algorithm for multiple aspect ranking and the extensions of the generative topic models were also widely studied, such as (Titov and McDonald., 2008; Brody and Elhadad., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; Jo and Oh., 2011; Lin and He, 2009).

In this paper, we build a general structural learn-ing model for joint sentiment classification and as-pect analysis using a latent discriminate method. Our model is able to predict the sentiment polari-ty of document as well as to identify aspect-specific sentences and predict the polarity of such sentences. The proposed method was evaluated with 9,000 Chi-nese restaurant reviews. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our model obtains promising per-formance. 2.1 Document Structure We assume that the polarity of document is closely related to some aspects for the reason that people are writing reviews to praise or criticize certain aspect-s. Therefore, each informative sentence of the doc-ument characterizes one aspect, expressing aspec-t specific polarity or subjective features. Similar to previous work on aspect analysis (Wang et al., 2010) and multi-level sentiment classification (Yessenali-na et al., 2010), we define the aspect as a collection of synonyms. For instance, the word set {  X  X alue X ,  X  X rice X ,  X  X ost X ,  X  X orth X ,  X  X uality X  } is a synonym set corresponding to the aspect  X  X rice X . For each document, an aspect is described by one or several sentences expressing aspect specific polarity or sub-jective information.

Let document be denoted by x , and y  X  X  +1 ,  X  1 } represents the positive or negative polarity of the document, s is the set of informative sentences, in which each sentence is attached with certain aspect a a sentence set that best explains the sentiment of the whole document while the s here retain this proper-ty. Let  X ( x,y,s ) denote the joint feature map that outputs the features describing the quality of predict-ing sentiment y using the sentence set s .

Let x j denote the j -th sentence of documen-t x , and a j is the attached aspect of x j . In spirit to (Yessenalina et al., 2010), we propose the follow-ing formulation of the discriminate function  X  X 
T  X ( x,y,s ) =
N ( x ) where N ( x ) is the normalizing factor,  X  pol ( x j ) and  X  subj ( x j ) represents the polarity and subjectivity features of sentence x j respectively.  X  X  pol and  X  X  subj denote the weight for polarity and subjectivity fea-tures. To be specific for each aspect, we have  X  X  pol for aspect a to calculate the polarity and subjectivity score. To make prediction, we have the document-level sentiment classifier as where S ( x ) = { s  X  1 ,..., | x | : | s | X  f ( | x | ) } f ( | x | ) is a function that depends only on the number of sentences in x , as illustrated in (Yessenalina et al., 2010). Therefore, for each sentence x j , we compute the joint subjectivity and polarity score with respect to aspect a and label y as score ( x j ,a,y ) = y  X   X  X  T pol we then assign aspect a j to sentence x j if After sorting score ( x j ,a j ,y ) in decreasing order and taking summation by selecting the top f ( | x | ) (or fewer, if there are fewer than f ( | x | ) that have posi-tive joint score) sentences as the total score for each y  X  X  +1 ,  X  1 } , we then predict y with the higher joint score as the sentiment of the whole document. This formulation of  X  X  T  X ( x,y,s ) and classifier explains that for each sentence, the assigned aspect has the highest score over other aspects. 2.2 Feature Space In our model, we use bag-of-words features. In or-der to obtain a model that is jointly trained, and sat-isfy the condition that the overall polarity of docu-ment should influence the sentiment of extracted in-formative sentences. We denote the weight vector modeling the polarity of entire document as  X  X  doc , as follows:  X  X 
T  X ( x,y,s ) = + 2.3 Training We trained our model using the latent structural SVMs (Yu and Joachims., 2009).
 OP1: min s.t.  X  i : max
We define  X  ( y i ,  X  y i ,s  X  ) = 1 , that is, we view document level sentiment classification loss as the loss function. It should be noticed that OP1 is non-convex. To circumvent the optimization difficul-ty, we employ the framework of structural SVM-s (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004) with latent variables proposed by Yu (2009) using the CCCP algorith-m (Yuille and Rangarajan., 2003). In terms of the formulation here, since the true informative sentence set is never observed, it is a hidden or latent variable. Thus, we keep s i fixed to compute the upper bound for the concave part of each constraint, and rewrite the constraints as  X   X  max After that, we have y i completed with the laten-t variable s i as if it is observed. For each training example, starting with an initialization sentence set in which each sentence is with an aspect label, the training procedure alternates between solving an in-stance of the structural SVM using the s i and pre-dicting a new sentence until the learned weight vec-tor  X  X  converges. In our work, we use the perfor-mance on a validation set to choose the halting iter-ation, as is similar to Yessenalina (2010). 2.4 Model Initialization To initialize the informative sentence set, following the experiment result of Yessenalina (2010), we set f ( | x | ) = 0 . 3  X  X  x | , that is, we only select the top 30% of the total sentences as the set of informative part of the document. The normalizing factor is set as N ( x ) = strates that square root normalization can be useful. To analyze the aspect of each sentence, we need to give an initial guess of the aspect and sentiment for each sentence.
 Sentence level sentiment initialization : To ini-tialize the sentence level sentiment, we employ a rule based method incorporating positive and neg-ative sentiment terms, with adversative relation con-sidered.
 Sentence aspect assignment initialization : Obvi-ously, if a synonym of aspect a occurs in sentence x , we assign aspect a to x l , and add x l to an aspect specific sentence set P a .For sentence x l without any aspect term, we set a as the aspect label if We select the sentences whose sentiment is consis-tent with the overall rating of a review as the initial guess of the latent variable. In this section, we evaluate our model in terms of document and sentence level sentiment classifica-tion, we also analyze the performance of aspect as-signment for each sentence. The model is evaluated on the Chinese restaurant reviews crawled from Di-anping 1 . Each of the reviews has an overall rating ranging from one to five stars. To be specific, we consider a review as positive if its rating is greater than or equal to 4 stars, or negative if less than or equal to 2 stars. The corpus has 4500 positive and 4500 negative reviews. Data and an implementation of our model are publicly available 2 .

We train 5 different models by splitting these re-views into 9 folds. Two folds are left out as the test-ing set, and each model takes 5 folds as training set, 2 folds as validation set, and the performance is aver-aged. Besides, we also manually label 100 reviews, in which each sentence is labeled as positive or neg-ative corresponding to certain aspect or with no as-pect description. On average, each review has 9.66 sentences. However, only 21.5% of the total sen-tences can be assigned to aspect by directly match-ing with aspect terms, which explains that keywords based aspect sentiment analysis may fail. For restau-rant reviews, we pre-defined 11 aspects, and for each aspect, we select about 5 frequently used terms to describe that aspect. Table 1 shows some examples of the aspect synonym set used in this paper: Aspect Synonym Set Taste  X  X  X   X  X aste X ,  X  X  X   X  X lavor X  Price  X  X  X   X  X rice X  ,  X  X  X   X  X ost X  Dishes  X  X  X   X  X ishes X ,  X  X  X   X  X uisine X  Ingredients  X  X  X   X  X ood X  ,  X  X  X   X  X ngredients X  Facility  X  X  X   X  X acility X ,  X  X  X   X  X eat X  Location  X  X  X   X  X ocation X ,

Our model yields an accuracy of 94.15% while the standard SVM classifier yields an accu-racy of 90.35%. Clearly, our model outperforms the baseline on document level sentiment classification. Sentence level sentiment classification Our method can extract a set of informative sentence that are coherent to the overall rating of a re-view. The evaluation of sentence-level sentiment classification is based on manual annotation. We sample 100 reviews, and present the extracted 300 sentences to annotators who have been asked to assign positive/negative/non-related labels. Among the sentences, 251 correctly classified as positive or negative while 49 are misclassified. And, 38 sentences of the 49 sentences have mix opinions or are non-subjective sentences.
 Aspect Assignment To evaluate the accuracy of as-pect assignment, we compare the predicted aspec-t labels with the ground truth (manual annotation). As some of sentences have explicit aspect terms and can be easily identified, we only consider those sen-tences without aspect words. In the extracted 300 sentences, 78 sentences have aspect terms, and for the rest, our model assigns correct aspect labels to 44 sentences while random guess only maps 21 sen-tences with right labels. In this paper, we address the task of multilevel sen-timent classification of online custom reviews for fine granular aspect analysis. We present a struc-tural learning model based on struct-SVM with la-tent variables. The informative sentence set is re-garded as latent variable, in which each sentence is attached with certain aspect label. The training pro-cedure alternates between solving an instance of the standard structural SVM optimization and predict-ing a new sentence set until the halting condition is satisfied. In addition, our model is a enough gen-eral model which can be easily extended to other domains. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our model obtains promising performance.

There are several possibilities to improve our model. For future work, we propose to incorpo-rate prior knowledge of latent variables to the mod-el. One possible way is to reformulate the loss func-tion by taking the predicted aspect of the extract-ed sentences into consideration. Another is to in-troduce confidence score to the extracted sentences, such that the learned support vectors that are labeled with higher confidence shall assert more force on the decision plane.
