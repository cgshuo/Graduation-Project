 1. Introduction
Queuing theory is a useful tool for studying the behavior of dynamic and stochastic service systems. It has been extensively applied to service organizations as well as manufacturing firms, where various types of customers are serviced by various types of servers according to specific queue disciplines ( Gross and Harris, 1998 ). Over the past decades, several research efforts on the queuing models were conducted ( Gray et al., 1992 ; Artalejo, 2001 ; Falin, 2010 ). For example, Gray et al. (1992) developed a M / G /1-type queuing model with service times depending on queue length, in which customers receive different services under different queue lengths. Artalejo (2001) dealt with the M / G /1 queue with D -policy, where the server was turned off at the end of a busy period and turned on when the cumulative amount of work firstly exceeded some fixed value D . Falin (2010) developed a single-server batch arrival queue model with returning custo-mers. Although the above queuing models are effective for handling various queuing phenomena with crisp parameters such and service time are assumed to follow certain distributions, namely, the arrival rate and the service rate have certain values.
However, in many realistic situations, the arrival and service patterns are more suitably described by fuzzy or stochastic terms.
The arrival rate and the service rate describing in the form of to deal with uncertain parameters. A number of studies regarding fuzzy queuing models have been investigated in recent years. Li and
Lee (1989) derived analytical results for two fuzzy queuing systems possibility concept and fuzzy Markov chains ( Stanford, 1982 ). Negi and Lee (1992) proposed a procedure using two-variable simulation ( Chanas and Nowakowski, 1988 ) and the concept of a -cut sets to analyze fuzzy queues (FQs). Kao et al. (1999) investigated four where F denoted fuzzy time and FM denoted fuzzified exponential time, and constructed their membership functions of the perfor-mance measures. Chen (2006) developed a nonlinear programming approach to derive the membershi p functions of the steady-state performance measures in bulk arrival queuing systems with varying as fuzzy numbers. Kalayanaraman et al. (2010) studied a queueing system with breakdowns and retrials in fuzzy environment and obtained some system characteris tics such as mean normal queue size, mean orbit size and mean system size. Generally speaking, the
FQ method can deal with imprecision or vagueness (expressed by membership functions) in queuing problems.
 municipal solid waste (MSW) management planning. In fact, complex queue phenomenons commonly exist in MSW manage-ment systems. For example, when waste-transport vehicles waited for the waste treatment of the landfill, incinerator and composting facilities, a queuing phenomenon might occur due to the current demand for a service exceeded the current capacity to provide that service caused by the high waste generation rate. The excessive waiting time of waste-transport vehicles and excessive serving time may cause a number of vehicles to leave because they were costly in the queuing system. Thus, the qu euing theory can be introduced into the MSW management system to reflect such complexities.
Moreover, in MSW management, uncertainties may exist in many system components (e.g. random waste generation rates, fluctuating the relevant decision ( Liu et al., 2009 ). Such uncertainties could bring significant difficulties to the formulation of waste-manage-ment models and generation of effective solutions ( Huang et al., 1993 ; Xu et al., 2009 ; Sun and Huang, 2010 ).
 ment is needed to support decisions of regarding short-term waste-management operation and long-term strategic planning ( Xi et al., 2010 ). The objective of this study is to propose an inexact fuzzy-queue programming (IFQP) model for municipal solid waste management, where a FM / F /1 FQ model will be introduced into the interval-fuzzy linear programming (IFLP) framework. The developed IFQP model can not only deal with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and interval values, but also reflect the influence of queuing problems. Moreover, it can help quantify the relationships between system cost and degree of satisfaction. This model improves upon the existing optimization model with advantages in data availability, uncertainty reflection and result analysis. A case study of MSW management will then be studied for demonstrating applicability of the developed method. It effectively reflects dynamic, interactive and uncertain characteristics of municipal waste management systems. The results obtained from the IFQP model can help decision makers obtain optimal waste-allocation patterns as well as gain in-depth insights into the tradeoffs between the satisfaction degree and the system cost. 2. Model development (WTE) facility, and recycling facility. An effective option for MSW treatment is to transport the waste to WTE facility because the waste-treatment costs can be offset by selling energy on market; however, waste-transport vehicles have to wait in queue because of landfill to pursue a minimum system cost. In addition, in real-world
MSW management problems, the quality of available information is generally poor, being often presented as vague values and/or tation costs, facility operation costs and revenues, and waste-generation rates may be described as intervals; at the same time, the lower and upper bounds of these interval parameters may also
Therefore, an inexact fuzzy-que ue programming (IFQP) model is desired for tackling such comp lexities and uncertainties. The
IFQP will incorporate the fuzzy queue (FQ) theory within an IFLP framework. 2.1. Fuzzy queuing model
Consider a general queuing system in which customers arrive at a facility with one server. The mean fuzzy arrival rate mean fuzzy service rate ~ m are approximately known and are represented by the following fuzzy sets ( Kao et al., 1999 ): ~ l  X f X  x , m ~ l  X  x  X  X  9 x A X g ,  X  1a  X  ~ m  X f X  y , m ~ m  X  y  X  X  9 y A Y g ,  X  1b  X  where X and Y are the crisp universal sets of the arrival rate and ship functions. The a -cut sets of ~ l and ~ m are: l  X f x A X 9 m ~ l  X  x  X  Z a g ,  X  2a  X   X f y A Y 9 m ~ m  X  y  X  Z a g ,  X  2b  X  where l a and m a are crisp sets. Based on the a -cut technique, the confidence intervals ( Zimmermann, 1995 ). Then, a fuzzy queueing model can be reduced to a family of crisp queues. The two sets represent sets of movable boundaries, and they form nested structures for expressing the relationship between ordinary sets and fuzzy sets ( Kaufmann, 1975 ).

Let ~ l and ~ m are fuzzy numbers. Their confidence intervals can be distribution in the interval of c onfidence and derive different possibility level a ( Negi and Lee, 1992 ). Numerical simulation is applied to complicated queuing systems instead of analytical derivation. In this study, parametric programming is employed to formulate the problem. Then the membership functions of interests can be constructed through the solution. In the following, two models will be discussed, one for the case of one fuzzy variable and the other for that of two fuzzy variables.

Suppose the arrival rate is a fuzzy number and the service rate interval which can be expressed in the form of [min x A X
Z constant arrival rate lies at possibility degree of a . According to tions of a and can be derived from l l a  X  min m 1 ~ l  X  a m 1 measure of interest. The p  X  ~ l , y  X  is a fuzzy number when
According to Zadeh X  X  extension principle, the membership function of p  X  ~ l , y  X  can be expressed as follows: where the interval for x varies with the different a -cut levels.
Consequently, we can construct its membership function based on its a -cut definition. Concretely, to find the intervals for p  X  possibility level a , two mathematical programs for the lower and upper bounds of it based on the different a -cut levels can be formulated: l  X  min p  X  x , y  X  subject to : l l a r x r u l a ,  X  4a  X  u a  X  max p  X  x , y  X  subject to : l l a
Two mathematical programs involve the systematic study of how the optimal solutions change as the bounds l l a and u programming ( Gal, 1979 ; Kao et al., 1999 ). If both l p L ( z ) and R ( z ), the membership function m p  X  ~ l , y  X  as follows: Zimmermann (1995) , all a -cuts can form a nested structure. This means that give a 1 , a 2 A  X  0 , 1 with a 1 4 a 2 , we have  X  l  X  l known explicitly, the shape of its membership function can be 1999 ).

When both the arrival rate and service rate are fuzzy numbers, based on the Zadeh X  X  extension prin ciple, the membership function either m ~ l  X  x  X  X  a and m ~ m  X  y  X  Z a or m ~ l  X  x  X  Z Consequently, this can be accomplished via the parametric programming technique as follows:  X  min p  X  x , y  X  subject to : l y  X  b 1 l m a  X  X  1 b 1  X  u m a b 1  X  0or1 , u 0 p a  X  max p  X  x , y  X  X  7a  X  subject to : l y  X  b 2 l m a  X  X  1 b 2  X  u m a , b 2  X  0or1 , l 00 p a  X  min p  X  x , y  X  X  7b  X  subject to : l m a r y r u m a x  X  b 3 l l a  X  X  1 b 3  X  u l a , b 3  X  0or1 , u 00 p a  X  max p  X  x , y  X  ,  X  7c  X  subject to : l m a r y r u m a , x  X  b 4 l l a  X  X  1 b 4  X  u l a , b 4  X  0or1 :  X  7d  X 
The above four models are mixed integer nonlinear programs (MINLP) with 0 X 1 variables and can be solved ( Hillier and arrival time, fuzzy service time, and one server) model is inves-tigated, where a first-come-first-served discipline with infinite source customers will be adopted. According to the concept of interarrival time, deterministic service time, and one server) models by using the concept of a -cut sets which are special cases of the M / G /1 model. According to the Pollaczek X  X hintchine formula 1971 ), the expected waiting time can be expressed as
W  X  x 2 y  X  y x  X   X  8  X  where x is mean arrival rate and y is mean service rate. The membership function for ~ W based on Eq. (6) is  X  z  X  X  sup where m ~ l  X  x  X  and m ~ m  X  y  X  are the membership functions of respectively. Although there is no a general formulation for m solve real-case problems, its mem bership function in Eq. (9) is can be applied to identify the membership functions of the perfor-mance measure. 2.2. Interval-fuzzy linear programming
When uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and interval values, the study problem can be formulated as an interval-fuzzy linear programming (IFLP) model ( Huang et al., 1993 ): min f subject to:
A
X
X
Z 0  X  10c  X  where A 7 A f R 7 g m n , B 7 A f R 7 g m 1 , C A f R 7 g and f R 7 g denote a set of interval numbers; symbols  X  ~ represent fuzzy equality and inequality, respectively. In fact, a decision in a fuzzy environment can be defined as the intersection of membership functions corresponding to fuzzy objective and constraint ( E ) in a space of decision alternatives ( X 7
In a symbolic form, we have D  X  G \ E , and correspondingly  X  min f m G , m E g X  11  X  where m D , m G and m E denote membership functions of fuzzy decision D , fuzzy goal G , and fuzzy constraint E , respectively ( Zimmermann, 1995 ). More generally, assume that we have n goals ( G 1 , G 2 , y , G n ) and m constraints ( E 1 , E decision will then be an intersection of the given goals and constraints as follows:
D  X  G 1 \ G 2 \ ... \ G n \ E 1 \ E 2 \ ... \ E m :  X  12  X 
Correspondingly, 2, y , m , and m G 2, y , n , a decision can then be defined by the following member-ship function ( Huang et al., 2001 ):  X  X  X  X 7  X  X  min f m where X 7 represents a set of fuzzy decision variables, and  X  X   X  X  denotes an appropriate and possibly context-dependent arithme-tic. m i  X  X 7  X  can be interpreted as the degree to which X fuzzy inequality in the objective and constraints. A desired decision is thus the one with the highest m D  X  X 7  X  value: max m D  X  X 7  X  X  maxmin  X  m i  X  X 7  X  , X 7 Z 0 ,  X  15  X  where m i  X  X 7  X  should be 0 if the objective and constraints are problem can be converted into an ordinary linear programming model by introducing a new variable of l  X  m D  X  X 7  X  , which corresponds to the membership function of the fuzzy decision ( Zimmermann, 1995 ; Chang et al., 1997 ; Khan et al., 2000 ; Huang in the objective (which are represented by fuzzy sets and denoted as  X  X  X uzzy constraints X  X  and  X  X  X uzzy goal X  X , respectively), can be expressed as membership grades ( l ) corresponding to the degrees of overall satisfaction for the constraints and objective. Thus, model (10) can be converted into max l 7  X  16a  X  subject to: C 7 X 7 r f  X  l 7  X  f  X  f  X  ,  X  16b  X  A 7 X 7 r B  X  l 7  X  f  X  f  X  ,  X  16c  X 
X 7 Z 0 ,  X  16d  X  0 r l 7 r 1 ,  X  16e  X  where f and f  X  are the lower and upper bounds of the objective X  X  ing to the degree (membership grade) of satisfaction for the fuzzy decision. An interactive algorithm was developed to solve the above problem through analyzing the detailed interrelationships between the parameters and the variables and between the objective func-tion and the constraints ( Huang et al., 1993 ; Yan et al., 2010 ). 2.3. IFQP modeling formulation
Fuzzy queuing models can effectively deal with the complex-ities of queuing phenomena, which are associated with fuzzy arrival rate and fuzzy service rate; moreover, consideration of waiting time and service time could help reduce the waste-disposal cost. However, the FQ model can only reflect one/two stochastic uncertainties described as arrival rate and service rate.
In fact, in the MSW management systems, many uncertainties may exist in the related costs, impact factors, and objectives and may be expressed as fuzzy sets and interval values; such uncer-tainties can further affect the related optimization processes and the generated decision schemes ( Li et al., 2008 ). Therefore, to more explicitly describe the real-world practical problems asso-ciated with more complexities, it is necessary to introduce the
FQ model into the IFLP framework; this leads to an inexact fuzzy-queue programming (IFQP) model. Fig. 1 shows the framework of the IFQP model. It is indicated that the IFQP integrates techniques of interval numbers, fuzzy sets, and fuzzy queue within a general framework. The IFQP can thus deal with uncertainties described as discrete intervals, fuzzy sets, and their combinations. More-over, it can reflect the influence of fuzzy queue. Therefore, we have the IFQP modeling formulation as follows: max l 7  X  17a  X  subject to :  X   X   X   X   X  [constraints for system cost] [constraints for landfill capacity] [constraints for WTE facility capacity] [constraints for waste disposal demand] X ijk Z 0 8 i , j , k  X  17f  X  [non-negativity constraints] 0 r l 7 r 1  X  17g  X  [control variable constraints] where i denotes the waste management facilities, i  X  1 for landfill, name of city, j  X  1, 2, y , n ; k isthetimeperiod, k  X  1, 2, the operating cost of facility i during period k ($/t); FT (percent of the incoming mass to facility i , i  X  2, 3, y revenue from facility i during period k ($/t), i  X  2, 3, y unit time per unit vehicle during period k [$/(h v)]; y 7 capacity of unit vehicle during period k (t/vehicle); X 7 from district j to facility i during period k (tons/day[t/d]). For any given a -cut level, we can obtain W 7 a  X  X  l W a , u solving the FM / F /1 model [Eq. (7)]. Consequently, the above IFQP model can be converted into an IFLP model. Then the IFLP model can be solved through a two-step method where a submodel corre-sponding to l  X  is first formulated and solved. This is based on the fact that the l  X  corresponds to f and the system objective is to be minimized. In the second step, the other submodel corresponding to l can then be formulated based on the solutions of the first max l  X   X  18a  X  subject to :  X   X   X  W a  X  k C k = S  X  k OP 2 k  X  X   X  r TL  X  l  X   X  TL  X  TL  X  X  18c  X   X  1 y  X  W a  X  k  X  X ijk r TE  X  i l  X   X  TE  X  i TE i  X 8 i , k  X  18d  X

X
Z 0 8 i , j , k  X  18f  X  0 r l  X  r 1  X  18g  X 
In the second step of the solution process, submodel corre-sponding to l can then be formulated as follows: max l  X  19a  X  subject to :  X   X   X  r TL  X  l  X  TL  X  TL  X  ,  X  19c  X  ijk  X  WG  X  jk l  X  WG  X  jk WG jk  X 8 j , k ,  X  19e  X

For a determined a 0 , the solution of the IFQP model can be obtained as follows: l 7  X  X  l , l  X  , f 7 opt  X  X  f opt , f  X  ijkopt , 8 i , j , k . The final waste flow to the landfill is X 3. Case study 3.1. Overview of the study system the IFQP model based on representative cost and technical data. The study region is assumed to cover three cities, as shown in
Fig. 2 . Consider a planning horizon of 15 years which is further divided into three periods with each having an interval of 5 years.
An existing landfill and a WTE facility are available to serve the region X  X  MSW disposal needs. Because of the limitation of the daily treatment capacity of WTE facility and the high waste-generation rate, a FQ will exist when the transportation vehicles wait for service in the WTE facility. Therefore, the waiting cost should be considered into the objective of the MSW management system, in order to reflect the effects of various allocations.
Moreover, if the waiting time is excessive, it may lead to a number of vehicles to leave the WTE facility to the landfill. The departure rate coefficient of the waiting time is assumed to be one per hour. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the FQ model into the MSW management system which could effectively deal with complexities existing queuing phenomenons.
 the WTE facility has capacity of [420, 540] t/d, respectively. With the growth of population and development of economic, waste generation rates may keep increasing over the planning horizon. waiting cost values are increasing. The WTE facility generates residues of approximately 30% of the incoming waste flow. In addition, it is assumed that a FM/F/1 queue (fuzzy exponential interarrival time, fuzzy service time, and one server) exists in
WTE facility, which adopts a first-come-first-service discipline and considers an infinite source population. For the three periods, both the arrival rate and service rate are trapezoidal fuzzy numbers represented by ~ l 1  X  X  5 : 5 , 5 : 6 , 5 : 9 , 6 , data for waste transportation, treatment/disposal and generation. It indicates that the waste generation rates and the costs for waste transportation, treatment/dispo sal vary temporally and spatially.
Therefore, the problem under consideration is how to effectively allocate the waste flows to suitable waste treatment facilities with the minimized system cost under various uncertainties. Based on the IFQP model developed in Eq. (17), the MSW management problem can be solved through the proposed method. 3.2. Results analysis
Table 3 presents the solution obtained from the IFQP model under a  X  1 (with the highest membership degree), where X denotes waste flows from city j to landfill ( i  X  1) or WTE facility flows from the queue in the WTE facility, X 7 2 jk  X  1 y 7 final waste flows carrying to the WTE facility, X 1 jk  X  X means the final waste flows carrying to the landfill without the residue. It is indicated that, in period 1, cities 1, 2 and 3 would costs of the landfill. For example, the departure waste flows from and [200.5, 219.9] t/d, respectively; the final waste flows carrying wastes would be shipped to either the landfill ([60.3, 146.7] and [48.1, 105.6] t/d, respectively) or the WTE facility ([190.8, 143.1] and [114.3, 152.4] t/d, respectively) due to increasing waste generation and the influences of queuing problems; in compar-ison, city 2 would ship all of its wastes to the landfill ([150.3, 159.9] t/d) in period 2. Such results are due to the facts that city 2 is much closer to the landfill than cities 1 and 3, while cities 1 and 3 are much closer to the WTE facility than city 2. It is thus suggested that the waste transportation costs and the operational costs of waste-management facilities have significant effects on waste flow allocation. In period 3, cities 1 and 3 would ship most of their waste flows into the WTE facility. Meanwhile, city 2 would contribute nearly all waste flows into the landfill. For example, the final waste flows carrying to the WTE facility from cities 1 and 3 would be [219.8, 193.7] and [153.8, 182.9] t/d, respectively; however, the final waste flows carried to the landfill from cities 1 and 3 would be [81.3, 146.1] and [67.6, 116.1] t/d, respectively. At the same time, the final waste flows carrying to the landfill from city 2 would be [159.8, 173.9] t/d, respectively; however, the final waste flows carrying to the WTE facility from city 2 would be [16.0, 20.5] t/d. Such results are mainly because the cities 1 and the landfill than cities 1 and 3. In addition, the queuing problems existing in the WTE facility would have significant effects on waste flow allocation in order to minimize system cost. For example, in period 2, the departure waste flows from city 1 to landfill would be only [0, 38.7] t/d; the departure waste flows from the queue in the WTE facility would be [60.3, 108.0] t/d; thus, the final waste flows carrying to the landfill without the residue would be [60.3, 146.7] t/d. The waste-flow allocations obtained from the IFQP model under a  X  1arepresentedin Figs. 3 X 5 .

Table 4 shows the solutions from the IFQP model under a  X  0 (with the lowest membership degree). In fact, the waste-flow-allocation patterns and the system costs would be various under different a -cut levels, meaning the different possibility degree.
Therefore, a comparison between the two extreme conditions (under a  X  0 and 1) for the MSW management problem is provided in order to further explain the different solutions under different a -cut levels. The final waste flows to the WTE would be all 0 t/d (under a  X  1) compared with [0, 14.4], 0, and [0, 8.5] t/d waste flows to the WTE would be [143.1, 190.8], 0, and [114.3, 152.4] t/d (under a  X  1) compared with [130.0, 200.9], [39.1, 62.0], respectively; the final waste flows to the WTE would be [193.7, 219.8], [16.0, 20.5] and [153.8, 182.9] t/d (under a  X  1) compared with [148.3, 230.4], [0, 4.2], and [118.6, 192.9] t/d (under a  X  0) -5 25 55 85 115 Waste flow (t/d)

Waste flow (t/d) for cities 1, 2 and 3 in period 3, respectively. Similarly, the departure waste flows from WTE to landfill (without residue) would be all 0 t/d (under a  X  1) compared with [0, 17.6], 0, and [0, 10.4] t/d (under a  X  0) for cities 1, 2 and 3 in period 1, respectively; the departure waste flows from WTE to landfill (without residue) would be [60.3, 108.0], 0, and [48.1, 86.2] t/d (under a  X  1) compared with [52.0, 158.9], [15.5, 47.8], and [40.1, 120.7] t/d (under a  X  0) for cities 1, 2 and 3 in period 2, respectively; the departure waste flows from WTE to landfill (without residue) would be [81.3, 146.1], [7.6, 12.1] and [67.6, 116.1] t/d (under a  X  1) compared with [68.8, 188.8], [0, 5.3] and [57.6, 150.9] t/d (under a  X  0) for cities 1, 2 and 3 in period 3, respectively. Then, the final waste flows to the landfill (without residue) would be [201.1, 239.8], [100.3, 109.9], and [200.5, 219.9] t/d (under a  X  1) compared with [201.1, 224.6], [100.3, period 1, respectively; the final waste flows to the landfill (with-out residue) would be [60.3, 146.7], [150.3, 159.9], and [48.1, 105.6] t/d (under a  X  1) compared with [50.2, 158.9], [88.3, 120.6], respectively; the final waste flows to the landfill (without residue) would be [81.3, 146.1], [159.8, 173.9], and [159.8, 173.9] t/d (under a  X  1) compared with [70.7, 190.7], [180.3, 185.6], and [180.3, 185.6] t/d (under a  X  0) for cities 1, 2 and levels correspond to different waiting time, and it will further affect the waiting costs. Under a  X  0 the solution intervals are wider; conversely, under a  X  1, the solution intervals are nar-rower. With the a -cut level increasing, the solutions regarding waste-flow allocations would appear in a higher feasible interval.
Table 5 lists the interval value of the waiting time under different a -cut levels in periods 1, 2 and 3. These a -cut levels represent the possibility that the waiting time will appear in the associated interval. Specially, a  X  0 corresponds to the interval where the waiting time could appear, while a  X  1 corresponds to the interval where the possibility of the appearance of the waiting time is much higher. For instance, for the period 1, the most likely value of the waiting time falls into the interval of [0.24, 0.43] h, and its value is impossible to fall outside the interval of [0.21, 0.55] h. In practical MSW management systems, the arrival rate and the service rate are affected by various uncertain factors, such as the rate of solid waste generation, the processing technology of solid waste and the capacity of waste-transport vehicles. There-fore, the waiting times of the waste-transport vehicles do not increase or decrease monotonously. For example, the lower bound of the waiting time is 0.23 h under a  X  0.6 cut in period 1, and Meanwhile, the upper bound of the waiting time is 0.47 h in the levels of the waiting time. With the increasing membership degree, the system cost will represent narrower interval values. The expected system cost is $[172.6, 238.1] 10 6 ,withthedegreeof system cost conforms to an alternative with a lower waste genera-a higher waste generation rate. Generally, planning with a higher system cost guarantees that the requirements of waste management and environmental regulations could be met; in contrast, as the one towards a lower system cost, these requirements may not be met. Thus, lower waste generation rate which corresponds to the lower system cost will give rise to lower decision variable values; on the contrary, higher waste generati on rate which corresponds to the higher system cost will bring about higher decision variable values. The l level reflects the decision makers X  preference about environ-mental and economic tradeoffs. Specifically, l  X  0.006 corresponds maximum degree of satisfaction u nder demanding conditions. In comparison, l  X  0.974 corresponds to the lower system cost ( f $172.6 10 6 ), representing the maximum degree of satisfaction under advantageous conditions. 4. Conclusions
In this study, an IFQP model has been developed for planning municipal solid waste management (MSW) system under uncer-tainty. Models of fuzzy queue and IFLP are integrated to effectively handle uncertainties that are presented in terms of fuzzy waiting time, fuzzy membership function and discrete intervals. The IFQP model can help decision makers not only obtain optimal waste among system cost, satisfaction degree and environmental requirement under mult iple uncertainties. Moreover, it can reflect the influence of queuing problems. This model improves upon the existing optimization model with advantages in data availability,
IFQP model is transformed into two deterministic submodels, which correspond to the lower and upper bounds of the desired objective.
The transform is based on an interactive algorithm. Interval solu-tions, which are used for generating decision alternatives, can then be obtained by solving the two submodels sequentially.
The model has been applied to a case study of waste-flow allocation within a municipal solid waste management system. The results indicate that reasonable solutions have been generated.
They can provide desired waste-flow-allocation patterns with mini-mized system cost and maximized system satisfaction degree.
Moreover, the IFQP model can more effectively reflect system cost variations and could, therefore, generate more realistic and applic-able solutions. They are helpful for supporting: (i) decision making or justification of waste-allocation patterns of MSW management system, and (ii) in-depth analysis of tradeoffs among system cost, satisfaction degree and environmental constraint under various linear programming and fuzzy queue within a general framework, and to apply the developed methodology to solid waste manage-ment planning. The results suggest that the proposed model is applicable to practical problems that are associated with various uncertainties expressed in multiple formats.

In conclusion, the developed method not only can directly handle multiple uncertainties but also can help quantify the relationships between system cost and degree of satisfaction, and thus afford reasonable measures for solving waste-flow allocation problems. As a first attempt, only a basic FM/F/1 fuzzy queuing model is introduced into the IFQP model in this study, which mainly assumes that the arriving rates of transportation vehicles obey the fuzzified exponential distribution and the service rates are fuzzy number. Correspondingly, the proposed method does not consider more queue problems, and ever concern the stochastic issues in waste management systems.
Furthermore, there are some limitations and assumptions of this approach used to handle real world problems, for instance, it only considers queuing systems with two fuzzy variables, without considering more fuzzy variables (e.g., k servers each has a fuzzy the quantity of waste-transport vehicle is finite). In addition, the major limitation of the proposed model is that the results are subjective because of the introduction of fuzzy parameters. All of these may make the IFQP model have difficulties in generating the desired schemes for decision makers in real world problems.
Consequently, the developed IFQP method could be further enhanced through introducing more advanced and complicated fuzzy exponential distribution) into optimal framework for envir-onmental systems planning.
