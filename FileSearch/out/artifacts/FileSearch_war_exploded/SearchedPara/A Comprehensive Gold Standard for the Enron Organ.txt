 Since the release of the Enron email corpus, many researchers have attempted to predict the Enron cor-porate hierarchy from the email data. This work, however, has been hampered by a lack of data about the organizational hierarchy. Most researchers have used the job titles assembled by (Shetty and Adibi, 2004), and then have attempted to predict the rela-tive ranking of two people X  X  job titles (Rowe et al., 2007; Palus et al., 2011). A major limitation of the list compiled by Shetty and Adibi (2004) is that it only covers those  X  X ore X  employees for whom the complete email inboxes are available in the Enron dataset. However, it is also interesting to determine whether we can predict the hierarchy of other em-ployees, for whom we only have an incomplete set of emails (those that they sent to or received from the core employees). This is difficult in particular because there are dominance relations between two employees such that no email between them is avail-able in the Enron data set. The difficulties with the existing data have meant that researchers have ei-ther not performed quantitative analyses (Rowe et al., 2007), or have performed them on very small sets: for example, (Bramsen et al., 2011a) use 142 dominance pairs for training and testing.

We present a new resource (Section 3). It is a large gold-standard hierarchy, which we extracted manu-ally from pdf files. Our gold standard contains 1,518 employees, and 13,724 dominance pairs (pairs of employees such that the first dominates the second in the hierarchy, not necessarily immediately). All of the employees in the hierarchy are email corre-spondents on the Enron email database, though ob-viously many are not from the core group of about 158 Enron employees for which we have the com-plete inbox. The hierarchy is linked to a threaded representation of the Enron corpus using shared IDs for the employees who are participants in the email conversation. The resource is available as a Mon-goDB database.

We show the usefulness of this resource by inves-tigating a simple predictor for hierarchy based on social network analysis (SNA), namely degree cen-trality of the social network induced by the email correspondence (Section 4). We call this a lower bound for SNA-based systems because we are only using a single simple metric (degree centrality) to establish dominance. Degree centrality is one of the features used by Rowe et al. (2007), but they did not perform a quantitative evaluation, and to our knowledge there are no published experiments us-ing only degree centrality. Current systems using natural language processing (NLP) are restricted to making informed predictions on dominance pairs for which email exchange is available. We show (Sec-tion 5) that the upper bound performance of such NLP-based systems is much lower than our SNA-based system on the entire gold standard. We also contrast the simple SN-based system with a specific NLP system based on (Gilbert, 2012), and show that even if we restrict ourselves to pairs for which email exchange is available, our simple SNA-based sys-tems outperforms the NLP-based system. The Enron email corpus was introduced by Klimt and Yang (2004). Since then numerous researchers have analyzed the network formed by connecting people with email exchange links (Diesner et al., 2005; Shetty and Adibi, 2004; Namata et al., 2007; Rowe et al., 2007; Diehl et al., 2007; Creamer et al., 2009). Rowe et al. (2007) use the email exchange network (and other features) to predict the domi-nance relations between people in the Enron email corpus. They however do not present a quantitative evaluation.
 Bramsen et al. (2011b) and Gilbert (2012) present NLP based models to predict dominance relations between Enron employees. Neither the test-set nor the system of Bramsen et al. (2011b) is publicly available. Therefore, we compare our baseline SNA based system with that of Gilbert (2012). Gilbert (2012) produce training and test data as follows: an email message is labeled upward only when every recipient outranks the sender. An email message is labeled not-upward only when every recipient does not outrank the sender. They use an n-gram based model with Support Vector Machines (SVM) to pre-dict if an email is of class upward or not-upward . They make the phrases (n-grams) used by their best performing system publicly available. We use their n-grams with SVM to predict dominance relations of employees in our gold standard and show that a simple SNA based approach outperforms this base-line. Moreover, Gilbert (2012) exploit dominance relations of only 132 people in the Enron corpus for creating their training and test data. Our gold stan-dard has dominance relations for 1518 Enron em-ployees. Klimt and Yang (2004) introduced the Enron email corpus. They reported a total of 619,446 emails taken from folders of 158 employees of the Enron corporation. We created a database of organizational hierarchy relations by studying the original Enron organizational charts. We discovered these charts by performing a manual, random survey of a few hundred emails, looking for explicit indications of hierarchy. We found a few documents with organi-zational charts, which were always either Excel or Visio files. We then searched all remaining emails for attachments of the same filetype, and exhaus-tively examined those with additional org charts. We then manually transcribed the information contained in all org charts we found.

Our resulting gold standard has a total of 1518 nodes (employees) which are described as be-ing in immediate dominance relations (manager-subordinate). There are 2155 immediate dominance relations spread over 65 levels of dominance (CEO, manager, trader etc.) From these relations, we formed the transitive closure and obtained 13,724 hierarchal relations. For example, if A immediately dominates B and B immediately dominates C , then the set of valid organizational dominance relations are A dominates B , B dominates C and A domi-nates C . This data set is much larger than any other data set used in the literature for the sake of predict-ing organizational hierarchy.

We link this representation of the hierarchy to the threaded Enron corpus created by Yeh and Harnley (2006). They pre-processed the dataset by combin-ing emails into threads and restoring some missing emails from their quoted form in other emails. They also co-referenced multiple email addresses belong-ing to one person, and assigned unique identifiers and names to persons. Therefore, each person is a-priori associated with a set of email addresses and names (or name variants), but has only one unique identifier. Our corpus contains 279,844 email mes-sages. These messages belong to 93,421 unique per-sons. We use these unique identifiers to express our gold hierarchy. This means that we can easily re-trieve all emails associated with people in our gold hierarchy, and we can easily determine the hierar-chical relation between the sender and receivers of any email.

The whole set of person nodes is divided into two parts: core and non-core . The set of core people are those whose inboxes were taken to create the Enron email network (a set of 158 people). The set of non-core people are the remaining people in the network who either send an email to and/or receive an email from a member of the core group. As expected, the email exchange network (the network induced from the emails) is densest among core people (density of 20.997% in the email exchange network), and much less dense among the non-core people (density of 0.008%).

Our data base is freely available as a MongoDB database, which can easily be interfaced with using APIs in various programming languages. For infor-mation about how to obtain the database, please con-tact the authors. We construct the email exchange network as fol-lows. This network is represented as an undirected weighted graph. The nodes are all the unique em-ployees. We add a link between two employees if one sends at least one email to the other (who can be a TO, CC, or BCC recipient). The weight is the number of emails exchanged between the two. Our email exchange network consists of 407,095 weighted links and 93,421 nodes.

Our algorithm for predicting the dominance rela-tion using social network analysis metric is simple. We calculate the degree centrality of every node in the email exchange network, and then rank the nodes by their degree centrality. Recall that the degree cen-trality is the proportion of nodes in the network with which a node is connected. (We also tried eigenvalue centrality, but this performed worse. For a discus-sion of the use of degree centrality as a valid indica-tion of importance of nodes in a network, see (Chuah and Coman, 2009).) Let C D ( n ) be the degree cen-trality of node n , and let DOM be the dominance re-lation (transitive, not symmetric) induced by the or-ganizational hierarchy. We then simply assume that for two people p 1 and p 2 , if C D ( p 1 ) &gt; C D ( p then DOM ( p 1 , p 2 ). For every pair of people who are related with an organizational dominance rela-tion in the gold standard, we then predict which per-son dominates the other. Note that we do not pre-dict if two people are in a dominance relation to be-gin with. The task of predicting if two people are in a dominance relation is different and we do not address that task in this paper. Therefore, we re-strict our evaluation to pairs of people ( p 1 , p 2 ) who are related hierarchically (i.e., either DOM ( p 1 , p 2 ) or DOM ( p 2 , p 1 ) in the gold standard). Since we only predict the directionality of the dominance relation of people given they are in a hierarchical relation, 1 the random baseline for our task performs at 50%. We have 13,724 such pairs of people in the gold standard. When we use the network induced simply by the email exchanges, we get a remarkably high accuracy of 83.88% (Table 1). We denote this sys-tem by SN A G .

In this paper, we also make an observation crucial for the task of hierarchy prediction, based on the dis-tinction between the core and the non-core groups (see Section 3). This distinction is crucial for this task since by definition the degree centrality mea-sure (which depends on how accurately the underly-ing network expresses the communication network) suffers from missing email messages (for the non-core group). Our results in table 1 confirm this in-tuition. Since we have a richer network for the core group, degree centrality is a better predictor for this group than for the non-core group.

We also note that the prediction accuracy is by far the highest for the inter hierarchal pairs. The in-ter hierarchal pairs are those in which one node is from the core group of people and the other node is from the non-core group of people. This is ex-plained by the fact that the core group was chosen by law enforcement because they were most likely to contain information relevant to the legal proceed-ings against Enron; i.e., the owners of the mailboxes were more likely more highly placed in the hierar-chy. Furthermore, because of the network character-istics described above (a relatively dense network), the core people are also more likely to have a high centrality degree, as compared to the non-core peo-ple. Therefore, the correlation between centrality degree and hierarchal dominance will be high. In this section we compare and contrast the per-formance of NLP-based systems with that of SNA-based systems on the Enron hierarchy gold standard we introduce in this paper. This gold standard al-lows us to notice an important limitation of the NLP-based systems (for this task) in comparison to SNA-based systems in that the NLP-based systems require communication links between people to make a pre-diction about their dominance relation, whereas an SNA-based system may predict dominance relations without this requirement.
 Table 2 presents the results for four experiments. We first determine an upper bound for current NLP-based systems. Current NLP-based systems pre-dict dominance relations between a pair of people by using the language used in email exchanges be-tween these people; if there is no email exchange, such methods cannot make a prediction. Let G be the set of all dominance relations in the gold stan-dard ( | G | = 13 , 723 ). We define T  X  G to be the set of pairs in the gold standard such that the people involved in the pair in T communicate with each other. These are precisely the dominance rela-tions in the gold standard which can be established using a current NLP-based approach. The number of such pairs is | T | = 2 , 640 . Therefore, if we consider a perfect NLP system that correctly pre-dicts the dominance of 2 , 640 tuples and randomly guesses the dominance relation of the remaining 11 , 084 tuples, the system would achieve an accu-racy of (2640 + 11084 / 2) / 13724 = 59 . 61% . We refer to this number as the upper bound on the best performing NLP system for the gold standard. This upper bound of 59 . 61% for an NLP-based system is lower (24.27% absolute) than a simple SNA-based system ( SN A G , explained in section 4) that predicts the dominance relation for all the tuples in the gold standard G .

As explained in section 2, we use the phrases provided by Gilbert (2012) to build an NLP-based model for predicting dominance relations of tuples in set T  X  G . Note that we only use the tu-ples from the gold standard where the NLP-based system may hope to make a prediction (i.e. peo-ple in the tuple communicate via email). This sys-tem, N LP Gilbert achieves an accuracy of 82.37% compared to the social network-based approach ( SN A T ) which achieves a higher accuracy of 87.58% on the same test set T . This comparison shows that SNA-based approach out-performs the NLP-based approach even if we evaluate on a much smaller part of the gold standard, namely the part where an NLP-based approach does not suffer from having to make a random prediction for nodes that do not comunicate via email.
 One key challenge of the problem of predicting domination relations of Enron employees based on their emails is that the underlying network is incom-plete. We hypothesize that SNA-based approaches are sensitive to the goodness with which the underly-ing network represents the true social network. Part of the missing network may be recoverable by an-alyzing the content of emails. Using sophisticated NLP techniques, we may be able to enrich the net-work and use standard SNA metrics to predict the dominance relations in the gold standard.
