 The continuing increase in the volume of information available in our daily lives is creating ever greater challenges for people to find personally useful information. One approach used to addressing this problem is Personalized Information Retrieval (PIR). PIR systems collect a us er X  X  personal information from both implicit and explicit sources to build a user profile with the objective of giving retrieval results which better meet their individual user information needs than a standard Information Retrieval (IR) system. However, in many situations there may be no opportunity to learn about the specific interests of a user and build a personal model when this user is querying on a new topic, e.g. when a user visits a museum or exhibition which is unrelated to their normal search interests. Under this condition, the experiences and behaviours of other previous users, who have made similar quer ies, could be used to build a model of user behavior in this domain. My PhD proposes to focus on the development of new and innovative methods of domain-specific IR. My work seeks to combine recommender algorithms trained using previous search behaviours from different searchers with a standard ranked IR method to fo rm a domain-specific IR model to improve the search effectiveness for a user entering a query without personal prior search history on this topic. The challenges for my work are: how to provide users better results; how to train and evaluate the methods proposed in my work. Since there are no suitable data collections available to enable us to explore this proposal, simulation plays a key role in our research. We have conducted an initial experiment study incorporating a very simple simulation method. The details are as follows:  X  The INEX 2009 Wikipedia document collection [2] was  X  !0 variants of each topic we re made by randomly deleting  X  An extended SMART retrieval system [3] was used with  X  A user grating for each retr ieval document was generated  X  Retrieved document rating values used to train a  X  The original topic statement was used as a test topic to  X  The information in this recommender was used to predict  X  For each document j , a final ranking weight The results of ranking retrieved results for each original topic using the extended SMART system are used as our baseline. The MAP increases from 0.0744 to 0.1178 (+58%). This initial experiment demonstrates the pot ential for utilizing recommender algorithms in IR. My current work is focusing on developing more realistic simulation models for the training environment, exploring the use of relevance feedback in combination with recommenders, automatically identifying topical domain of topics and automatically clustering topics for training recommenders, exploring the de velopment of more suitable evaluation metrics, and exploiting other recommender algorithms to make this approach more effective.
