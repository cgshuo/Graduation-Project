 The inaugural issue of ACM TIST, in October, 2010, was a special issue on AI in Social Computing and Cultural Modeling. The purpose of the special issue was to pro-vide a forum for interdisciplinary researchers to share their views and report original cutting-edge AI research on two closely related topics: s ocial computing , the study of social behavior and social context based on computational systems; and cultural modeling , the modeling of perceptions and atti tudes that are shared across social groups.

Because of the large number of high-quality articles that were submitted for the special issue, it became a two-part issue. This is the second and final part of the issue. We are happy to present the following articles.

In  X  X APs: Geospatial Abduction Problems X , Paulo Shakarian et al. examine the following problem: when a group of humans cause a violent event (e.g., an explosion or an attack) at some geographic location, how can one infer what other geographic locations may have an important relation to the event? They present a theory and algorithms and demonstrate their algorithms on the problem of locating IED weapons caches used in attacks on US forces in Iraq.

In  X  X n Adaptive Agent for Negotiating with People in Different Cultures X , Gal et al. look at how to design computerized agents that can negotiate effectively with human negotiators of different cultural backgrounds. They describe ways for such an agent to model the negotiator and adapt its behavior to those traits. They describe experiments in which the agent negotiated with human subjects in the U.S. and Lebanon, and they provide some surprising conclusions about how the humans X  cultural characteristics affected the outcomes of the negotiation.

One of the most common ways of structuring human competitions such as sporting events is called a  X  X nockout tournament, X  and an important question about such tour-naments is how to construct them in a way that is fair to everyone involved. In  X  X air Seeding in Knockout Tournaments X , Vu and Shoham provide theoretical and algorith-mic results for this problem. They show how to achieve fairness in some cases and prove that it is impossible to achieve fairness in other cases.

In  X  X eographic Information Systems and Spatial Agent-Based Model Simulations for Sustainable Development X , Cioffi-Revilla et al. explain the need for incorporating geographical information systems into simulation models of human societies. They describe their work by incorporating a geographical information system into an open-source simulation environment.
