 The use of networks to support a nd scale school reform initiatives and educational programs are becoming more and more prevalent. Through an initiative of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT), an emerging organizational form known as a Networked Improvement Community (NIC), offers an infrastructure fo r implementing and improving educational innovations. Fundamental to the work of this network is the collaboration of multiple actors and teams at multiple sites. Yet, this collaboration across time and space does not just happen. It requires coordination mechanisms to guide the actions of those involved in collaboration. This re search seeks to build an initial conceptual framework to study how the joint work on an educational reform happens in a distributed or networked organizational environment. A NIC is a case of one such environment. H.5.3 Groups &amp; Organization In terfaces X  computer-supported cooperative work Management, Theory Coordination, Organizational Network, Learning The use of networks to support a nd scale school reform initiatives and educational programs are becoming more and more prevalent. There are networks to support out of school learning (e.g. Hive Learning Network), there are networks to support government-funded program implementation s (e.g. Promise Neighborhoods) and networks to support teachers (e.g. National Writing Project), to name a few. In short, a ne twork represents an emerging organizational form to develop, implement and potentially scale educational programs and innovations. There are a variety of reasons why networks present an opportunity upon which new programs can capitalize. For example, networks enable groups of organizations to take on problems that are bigger than a single organization could tackle [9]. Moreover, the network enables the sharing of novel information [12], the utilizing of expertise that is not present in one X  X  organization [11] as well as sharing resources [6], a network failure rate of community colle ge students in developmental mathematics. X  To this end, Quantway consists of community college teams, research teams, software design teams, curriculum design teams, as well as CFAT program staff, all working to encourage success in community college mathematics and develop quantitatively literate citizens. Working from the definition of coordination as  X  X anaging dependencies between activities. X  [7], there are three strands of research that are informing this work: the notion of coordination as a dynamic activity, coordi nation theory and coordination mechanisms. These strands of res earch provide a starting point to understand coordination within an educational improvement network. The study of groups of people who carry out work within teams and / or organizations requires a nuanced view of organizing, rather than the organization [2]. Coordination in these groups and organizations is not reduced to a se t of static structures, but rather it is an ongoing and dynamic activity that unfolds when work is accomplished [3]. And it is not just the work that is coordinated, but also other factors as well such as technology, that impact the social dynamics of organizing [1]. While coordination is a dynami c process in organizations, coordination theory was develo ped to understand and manage organizational processes [8]. Identifying these processes provides substantial leverage for redesign ing processes for organizational improvement. Furthermore, categor izing the processes by their interdependencies suggests the ways that the processes can be managed. In short, coordination theory is an ongoing attempt to build a body of  X  X heories about how coordination can occur in diverse kinds of systems X  [8]. Finally, coordination of work processes is a multi-layered activity that calls upon more than rules of interactions. There are other coordination mechanisms. For exam ple, a coordinative protocol constitutes the set of rules and conventions that govern the interaction. A coordinative artifact is the protocol in symbolic form and thus objectified (Sch midt &amp; Simone, 1996). Together, the coordinative artifact and pr otocol provide guidance to the collaborative process. As this research is ongoing, this theoretical background guides the work of investigating how joint work unfolds in Quantway. This includes identifying the work practices of the network, categorizing these work practices by their dependencies and then inquiring into the mechanisms a nd enactments that coordinate these dependencies. This research aims to a contribu tion to the field of education and the learning sciences. First, this works seeks to introduce and extend established work on coordina tion to the field of education. This may be important as networ ks become a organizational and policy strategy for new initiatives. For example, as networks become more prominent as an organizational form to facilitate school reform and improvement, t hose initiating these networks will need developed understanding of what mechanisms to support coordinated work. More to the direct spirit of this work, these initiatives will need to acknowledge the interdependencies
