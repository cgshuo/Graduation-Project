 This report presents a review of the 5th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Inductive Databases (KDID X 06), which was organized by the authors and held in Berlin, Germany, on September 18, 2006, in conjunc-tion with ECML/PKDD X 06, the 17th European Confer-ence on Machine Learning and the 10th European Confer-ence on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases. The goal of the workshop was to bring together the researchers that are interested in the area of inductive databases, inductive queries, constraint-based data mining, and data mining query languages. While knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining have enjoyed great popularity and success in recent years, there is a distinct lack of a generally accepted frame-work for data mining. The present lack of such a framework is perceived as an obstacle to the further development of the field (as discussed, e.g., during the SIGKDD X 03 panel  X  X ata Mining: The Next 10 Years X ). The development of a unifying framework for data mining would clearly facilitate further progress in the field. The quest for such a framework is therefore a major research priority.
 The most promising approach to this task is taken by induc-tive databases, an emerging research area at the intersection of data mining and databases. Inductive databases (IDBs) contain not only data, but also patterns. Patterns can be either local patterns , such as frequent itemsets, which are of descriptive nature, or global models , such as decision trees, which are of predictive nature. In an IDB, ordinary queries can be used to access and manipulate data, while inductive queries can be used to generate (mine), manipulate, and apply patterns. In the IDB framework, patterns become  X  X irst-class citizens X  and KDD becomes an extended query-ing process in which both the data and the patterns that hold in the data are queried. IDB research thus aims at replacing the traditional KDD process model, where steps like pre-processing, data cleaning, and model construction follow each other in succession, by a simpler model in which all data pre-processing operations, data mining operations, as well as post-processing operations are queries to an in-ductive database and can be interleaved in many different ways.
 The IDB framework is appealing as a theory for data min-ing, because it employs declarative queries instead of ad-hoc procedural constructs . As such, it holds the promise of facil-itating the formulation of an  X  X lgebra X  for data mining, the equivalent of Codd X  X  relational algebra for databases. As declarative queries are often formulated using constraints, inductive querying is closely related to constraint-based data mining and is concerned with defining the necessary con-straints and primitives for effective data mining. The IDB framework is also appealing for data mining applications, as it supports the whole KDD process. In inductive query languages, the results of one (inductive) query can be used as input for another: nontrivial multi-step KDD scenarios can be thus supported in IDBs, rather than just single data mining operations. The aim of the workshop was to bring together the re-searchers that are interested in the area of inductive data-bases, inductive queries, constraint-based data mining, and data mining query languages.
 This fifth edition of the workshop followed the previous four successful KDID workshops, all organized in conjunc-tion with the European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML) and the European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (PKDD), over the period 2002 to 2005. KDID X 02 was held in Helsinki, Finland, KDID X 03 was held in Cavtat-Dubrovnik, Croatia, KDID X 04 was held in Pisa, Italy, and KDID X 05 was held in Porto, Portugal. The last two editions of the workshop have published proceedings in Springer X  X  Lecture Notes in Com-puter Science Series and also the proceedings of this edition will be published by Springer (cf. references [ 3 ; 4 ; 5 ]). Two European IST FET projects have been devoted to the topic of the workshop: the project cInQ  X  X onsortium on Knowledge Discovery by Inductive Queries X  (2001-2004) and the project IQ  X  X nductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models X  (2005-2008). KDID X 06 was supported by IQ. More information is available on the IQ project website: http://iq.ijs.si/ .
 The workshop opened with an invited talk by Kiri L. Wagstaff from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, USA. The topic of Kiri X  X  talk was constrained clustering. Over the past five years, constrained (semi-supervised) clustering methods have become very popular, motivated by applications such as gene clustering, document clustering, web search result clustering, and automatic lane finding from GPS traces. In her talk, Kiri identified three key open questions for the field of constrained clustering: how can the utility of a given constraint set be determined a-priori; how can the most useful constraints be actively so-licited; and when should constraints be propagated or shared with neighboring points? Kiri stressed that addressing these questions is required before constrained clustering methods can be applied to very large data sets in an efficient and principled fashion.
 The workshop continued with the presentation of eleven con-tributed papers. Six of these considered local (frequent) pattern mining, two focused on global models, and three contributions were about inductive query languages and en-vironments. We briefly discuss each contribution below. Two contributions introduce new pattern representations. In  X  X uantitative Episode Trees X , Mirco Nanni and Chris-tophe Rigotti introduce a new pattern domain called quan-titative episode trees for mining (sets of) event sequences. A quantitative episode tree compactly represents the main occurrence groups of an episode by means of a tree struc-ture, and provides quantitative bounds on the durations of each step of the episode.
 The second new representation is Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZBDDs). In their paper  X  X requent Pat-tern Mining and Knowledge Indexing Based on Zero-sup-pressed BDDs X , Shin-ichi Minato and Hiroki Arimura pro-pose to use ZBDDs to represent sets of item sets. ZBDDs generalize BDDs, which are a compact, graph based rep-resentation for Boolean functions. The paper proposes a (maximal) item set mining algorithm based on ZBDDs and argues that the ZBDD representation allows for efficient in-ductive querying of the item sets.
 The next two contributions consider new constraint types. In  X  X fficient Mining under Flexible Constraints through Sev-eral Datasets X , Arnaud Soulet, Ji X r  X  X  Kl  X ema and Bruno Cr  X e-milleux propose a pattern mining algorithm supporting con-straints built from a large set of primitives, which take into account heterogeneous data (e.g., binary data and texts). It relies for efficiency on a new closure operator that allows for interval based pruning of the search space. The algorithm is tested on bioinformatic data.
 The second special type of constraints that is considered are so called soft constraints. In their work  X  X eighted and Probabilistic Instances of the Soft Constraint Based Pat-tern Mining Paradigm X , Stefano Bistarelli and Francesco Bonchi provide a theoretical basis and experimental analy-sis of probabilistic and weighted soft constraints. The prob-lem with regular constraints, such as minimum frequency, is that they are Boolean: a discontinuity occurs where the con-straint changes from true to false. Interestingness, however, is usually not a discontinuous function and soft constraints address this mismatch.
 Most constrained based pattern mining algorithms consider binary data. Practical data, however, may be numeric or might contain missing values. The following two contribu-tions address these issues. In  X  X ining Bi-sets in Numerical Data X , J  X er  X emy Besson, C  X eline Robardet, Luc De Raedt and Jean-Fran  X cois Boulicaut propose a method for mining nu-merical bi-sets. A numerical bi-set is a set of objects and a set of attributes such that all values in the corresponding cells are within a user specified range. The latter can be viewed as a constraint on the bi-sets. A second constraint ensures that the bi-sets are maximal. The algorithm uses these constraints to prune the search for bi-sets.
 Data with missing values is considered by Fran  X cois Rioult and Bruno Cr  X emilleux in  X  X ining Correct Properties in In-complete Databases X  for the case of k -free patterns. The authors propose a new definition for k -freeness suitable for incomplete data. This definition guarantees that the k -free patterns extracted from an incomplete database are k -correct, that is, they are also k -free in every possible comple-tion of the database. They also show how patterns satisfying this new definition can be efficiently mined.
 Two papers investigate how inductive databases can better support global models, such as decision trees.  X  Elisa Fromont and Hendrik Blockeel focus on this topic in  X  X ntegrating De-cision Tree Learning into Inductive Databases X . Inspired by a similar approach for item sets, they investigate how deci-sion trees can be stored in relational tables and queried using standard SQL queries. Using a prototype implementation, they illustrate the method with a number of interesting in-ductive queries for decision trees.
 Decision trees can be used for a wide range of data min-ing tasks, such as prediction and clustering, and are as such very relevant to IDBs (which should provide a general data mining framework). This is argued by Sa X so D X zeroski, Ivica Slavkov, Valentin Gjorgjioski and Jan Struyf in  X  X nalysis of Time Series Data with Predictive Clustering Trees X . This paper shows how predictive clustering trees, a generalization of decision trees, can cluster bioinformatic time series data. The main advantage of the approach over regular cluster-ing is that it, in addition to the clustering, also provides a symbolic description of the clusters.
 The last three papers consider inductive query languages and environments. In  X  X QL: A Proposal for an Inductive Query Language X , Siegfried Nijssen and Luc De Raedt in-troduce the inductive query language IQL. IQL intends to be a general, descriptive, declarative, extendable, and imple-mentable language that supports the mining of both local and global patterns, reasoning about inductive queries and query processing using logic, as well as the flexible incorpo-ration of new primitives and solvers. IQL extends the tuple relational calculus with functions, types, and data mining primitives.
 Kenneth A. Kaufman, Ryszard S. Michalski, Jaros law Pietr-zykowski and Janusz Wojtusiak present their VINLEN sys-tem in  X  X n Integrated Multi-task Inductive Database and Decision Support System VINLEN: An Initial Implementa-tion and First Results X . VINLEN is built around knowl-edge generation operators, which given input data and/or knowledge create new knowledge. The central operator of VINLEN is a natural induction module that generates hy-potheses from data in the form of interpretable attributional rules. The paper illustrates VINLEN with a medical appli-cation.
 Last but not least, Francesco Bonchi, Fosca Giannotti, Clau-dio Lucchese, Salvatore Orlando, Raffaele Perego and Rober-to Trasarti present their ConQueSt system in  X  X n Inter-active Pattern Mining from Relational Databases X . Con-QueSt supports the intrinsically exploratory, human-gui-ded, interactive, and iterative nature of pattern discovery. Following the IDB vision, it provides users with an expres-sive constraint based query language that allows the dis-covery process to be effectively driven toward potentially interesting patterns. ConQueSt is a practical system that can mine  X  X eal world X  data stored in relational databases. We presented a brief review of the 5th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Inductive Databases (KDID X 06), which continued the tradition of the four pre-vious editions and aimed to bring together the researchers that are interested in the area of inductive databases, induc-tive queries, constraint-based data mining, and data mining query languages. We certainly hope that the momentum gained by this 5th edition of the KDID workshop will con-tinue to foster close cooperation between all researchers in-terested in these related fields.
