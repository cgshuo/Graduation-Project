 For languages still lacking state-of-the-art coreference resolution tools, manual annota-tion of coreference over a substantially large dataset is traditionally the first step of the work: after the labor-intensive process is over, a supervised resolver can be trained on the hand-annotated documents. Since such resource was until recently unavailable for Polish, all coreference-related work concentrated on theoretical modelling, rule-based or projection-based approaches, and were evaluated on very small data samples. pus of general direct nominal coreference of Polish (currently in last phases of con-struction). In this paper we present the decisions we made while selecting and adopting the annotation schema for this corpus and how they were influenced (and then verified against the real-world data) by recent works on the subject and our understanding of certain linguistic phenomena related to anaphora and coreference in highly inflectional languages.
 cuss how certain linguistic features of an inflectional language influence the annotation schema and resolution tools. Statistics of the respective phenomena and inter-annotator agreement values are also presented. Our annotation schema defines mentions as nominal groups (NGs) taking into account their potential referentiality, which is based on observation that certain stylistically marked cases allow of using traditionally non-referential expressions in referential con-texts, as in (1) 5 .

In our task we concentrate on identity of reference in its strict form (direct reference) with an extension of so called near-identity (see section 4). The annotation schema resumed in the previous section was presented in details in (anonymous reference). It was also compared with several approaches to coreference annotation in languages that show coreference-relevant morphosyntactic similarities with Polish, i.e. Slavic languages [1,2] and Spanish [3,4] due to its frequent zero subject. A recent study dedicated to English [5] was also considered for obvious dominance rea-sons in NLP. In view of this contrastive study our annotation schema shows three major novel aspects which we deeply analyse in this paper:  X  large-scale experiments with near-identity,  X  introduction of dominant expressions,  X  pointing at semantic rather than syntactic heads.
 our approach brings some new insights into the state of the art. In order to further verify these novelty issues, we present below some other bibliographic references reporting on coreference annotation schemas which were applied to corpora of about 200 thousand words or more  X  according to [6], p. 10.
 from 1999 to 2008 for a varying number of languages, including Arabic, Chinese, English, and Spanish. It was meant to boost the development of automatic detection and characterization of meaning conveyed by human texts. The ACE-2007 annotation guidelines for Spanish [7] gives the rules of annotating and disambiguating entities. The entity typology is rather fine-grained: it consists of 7 main types (person, orga-nization, geopolitical entity, etc.) and several dozens of subtypes (individual, group, governmental, commercial, etc.). Two coreference relations are considered: identity and apposition. The former is further subdivided into generic and non-generic. Mentions are NGs (including attached prepositional phrases and relative clauses) and can be nested ( the president of Ford ). Each NGs should have its (syntactic) head marked. Heads are marked but their definition is confusing (the syntactic head can be multi-word, and then its last token is marked). Semantic heads different from syntactic ones are not an issue. The problem of Spanish zero subject is not mentioned. man newspaper texts (T X Ba-D/Z) with a set of 7 coreference relations (coreferential, anaphoric, cataphoric, bound, split antecedent, instance, and expletive). These are no equivalence relations: they are non-symmetric and mostly non-transitive, thus they do not divide the set of referents into disjoint clusters. For instance, the split antecedent relation holds between a plural expression and a mention of a single member. E.g. in  X  John and Mary were there... Both...  X , John and both , as well as Mary and both are coreferential but John and Mary are not. Potential markables are definite NGs, per-sonal pronouns, relative, reflexive, and reciprocal pronouns, demonstrative, indefinite and possessive pronouns. All of them correspond to nodes of the already existing parse trees resulting from prior syntactic annotation. Unlike in our approach, predicative nom-inal groups (NGs) seem to be considered coreferential with subjects. Zero subjects are not an issue in German. Neither dominant expressions nor semantic heads are men-tioned. Bank of newspaper texts (I-CAB). Mentions are NGs, possibly containing modifiers, prepositional complements or subordinate clause, representing entities (persons, orga-nizations, etc.) or temporal expressions. ACE-2003 annotation guidelines for English are adopted and extended, to cover notably clitics contiguous with verbs ( vederl o ) and coordinated expressions ( John and Mary ). The paper announces future annotation of relations between entities but it is unclear where its results have been described. ence and predicate-argument relations (including nominal predicates relating to events). They consider identity-of-reference relations for the former, and both identity-of-reference and identity-of-sense relations for the latter. They pay a special attention to zero anaphora, whose role  X  not only as a subject but as an object or a complement as well  X  is particularly visible when coreference and predicates X  arguments are annotated jointly. Namely, the frames for elided arguments have to be filled out with antecedents appear-ing in other sentences than the predicate itself. The reported inter-annotator agreement for coreference annotation is 0.893 for recall and 0.831 for precision. No mention of dominant expressions or semantic heads is made. Chinese and Arabic. It is supposed to make up for the drawbacks of previous annotation schemata, mainly MUC and ACE in that the coreference annotation is not restricted to NGs and a larger set of entity types is considered. The English corpus consists of 300-thousand word newspaper texts, later completed by broadcast conversation data [12]. All data have been previously annotated for syntax, verbal arguments and word senses (by linking words to nodes of an external ontology). Thus, mention candidates corre-spond to nodes of pre-existing syntax trees. As in ACE, two coreference relations are considered: identity and apposition. The main mention candidates are specific NGs, pronouns ( they , their ) and single-word verbs coreferent with noun phrases (e.g. the sales rose by 18%  X  the strong growth ). Expletive ( it rains ), pleonastic ( there are ) and generic ( you need ) pronouns are not marked. Generic, underspecified or abstract entities are only partly considered by identity: those cannot be interlinked among them-selves, even if they can be linked with referring pronouns ( parents  X  they ). Nested structures are generally marked but exceptions occur in dates (e.g. no subphrase of Nov. 2, 1999 is coreferent with November ). Only intra-document coreference is annotated, thus dominant expressions (motivated in our approach notably by future inter-document coreference annotation) are not an issue. Zero subjects are addressed with respect to pro-drop Arabic and Chinese pronouns [12]. Since such pronouns are materialized in parse trees as separate nodes, their inclusion in coreference chains is straightforward. The existence of semantic heads different from syntactic ones is not mentioned. per texts, transcribed speech and medical encyclopedia entries. Its annotation schema is largely based on the MUC-7 annotation guidelines for English 6 . Annotation fo-cuses mainly on identity relations between NGs but other non-equivalence relations are also introduced: bound relations ( everybody  X  they ), bridging relations (e.g. superset X  subset or group X  X ember), and predicative relations (e.g. John is a painter). Syntactic heads are pointed at but semantic heads different from syntactic ones do not seem to be an issue (e.g. tons is the head of 200,000 tons of sugar ). The ideas of dominant expres-sions and zero subjects are not present. Predicative NGs and appositions are considered as mentions coreferent with their subjects. Discontinuous NGs are taken into account. The inter-annotator agreement measured as the MUC-like F-score, is 0.76 for identity relations, 0.33 for bridging relations and 0.56 for predicative relations.
 coreference-related aspects:  X  large-scale annotation of near-identity introduced by [3], cf. Section 4, which obvi- X  dominant expressions (cf. Section 5), whose idea appears in none of the studied  X  semantic heads (cf. Section 6), whose difference from syntactic heads does not [1] (for Bulgarian), [3] (for Spanish), [10] (for Japanese), [12] (for Arabic and Chinese) and ours (for Polish). In Section 7 we revisit this notion in order to report on its nature and frequency in our corpus. Near-identity is a novel coreference relation defined in [14]. Our understanding of this concept, as discussed in (Anonymous citation) includes two phenomena: (i) two men-tions refer to the same entity but the text suggests the opposite (refocusing, e.g. pre-war Warsaw vs. today X  X  Warsaw ), (ii) two mentions refer to different entities but the text suggests the opposite (neutralization, e.g. wine as a bottle vs. its contents). [15] state that the binary distinction between coreference (identity) and non-coreference (non-identity) is too limited, since a continuum of values exists between these two extreme cases. Near-identity should help in bridging this gap. The same paper puts forward a fine-grained typology of near-identity with 4 types (name metonymy, meronymy, class, spatio-temporal function) and 15 subtypes (role, location, organization, etc.). seemed uncertain. Thus, before including it in our annotation schema we first studied the reliability of detecting near-identity alone, i.e. regardless of its type. As discussed in Section 9, the value obtained for inter-annotator agreement in untyped near-identity links, in terms of Cohen X  X   X  , was only 0.222. Some annotators never even used the near-identity links, which proves that the concept is hard to capture.
 ogy but also of the near-identity as such. The concept of near-identity might be, in our opinion, a result of mixing two different levels of language: the meaning of a word and its reference. The former is independent of the context while the latter is a function of a word used in a given context. Words very often have common elements of meaning  X  that is why it was possible to create semantic networks like WordNet (web of words which are linked with each other without any context). Reference though is related more to pragmatics than to semantics. Very often phrases formed with words sharing no se-mantic elements can refer to the same referent (e.g.: football players of Polonia and  X  X lack shirts X  ), and the link between such phrases can be established only due to the external knowledge (Polonia football players wear black shirts). On the other hand the same words can refer to different referents, e.g.: same basic semantics): generic nails, nails of the speaker, and artificial nails. lem with distinguishing these two linguistic levels: the word meaning and the word reference. Conversely, near-identity links seem rather hard to establish and no repeat-able pattern in the near-identity annotation has occurred. Therefore in our opinion the utility of the near-identity concept for coreference annotation is questionable. In every cluster we indicate the dominant expression , i.e. the expression that carries the richest semantics or describes the referent the most precisely. The best candidates for dominant expressions are named entities, as well as periphrastic phrases that denote a particular object in the discourse world, e.g: large set of pronouns denoting various persons (e.g. in fragments of plays or novels). We think that it might also facilitate cross-document annotation or the creation of a semantics frame containing different descriptions of the same object.
 tained in the cluster. 77% of them were taken without any changes (which means that there was the base form of the NG in the cluster) as in (7), while 23% of them were transformed into their base forms. (7) Cluster: tamtejszy dziennikarz, dziennikarz, Ja, napisa X , pismak given by the annotator instead (e.g., Halloween for the cluster containing a repeated phrase: tej okazji  X  X his occasion X  ). This was necessary in particular when the cluster con-sisted of verb forms only, e.g.: (8) Cluster: stwierdzili, powiedzieli  X  X tated, said X  higher reliability (66.78%) than near-identity. A detailed study of disagreement cases shows that many of them are superficial rather than essential. They are due e.g. to dif-ferent letter case or spelling errors in the dominant expressions, or to the fact that some annotators produce the base form of the dominant expressions while others cite the (inflected) forms occurring in the corpus. Such cases may be corrected mostly automat-ically, which will enhance the inter-annotator agreement indicator. For each mention, its semantic head is selected, being the most relevant word of the group in terms of meaning. The semantic head of typical nominal group is the same element as the syntactic head but in numeral groups the numeral is the syntactic head, and the noun is the semantic head. Numeral groups are regarded as nominal groups in our project (e.g., du  X  zo pieni  X edzy  X  X  lot of money X , trzech z was  X  X hree of you X ). They can be also embedded in other nominal groups (e.g., s  X asiad dw X ch kobiet  X  X eighbour of two women X ). In these examples, words du  X  zo, trzech, dw X ch  X  X  lot, three, two X  are syntactic heads and pieni  X edzy, was, kobiety  X  X oney, you, women X  are semantic heads. same as when we admit a very broad definition of nominal groups (including numeral phrases, some adjectival phrases, etc., cf. Section 2). Namely, coreference is a phe-nomenon on the level of semantics and discourse more than syntax. Thus, understand-ing the semantically central elements should help establish discourse links, notably in future automatic coreference resolvers. In particular, it seems promising to examine agreement in case, gender, number, synset, etc. between semantic heads in potentially co-referring mentions.
 (97.00%). Disagreement resulted mainly from inattention in distinguishing syntactic from semantic heads, e.g., a) adjectives or numerals were selected instead of nouns, b) the head of a subordinate phrase was selected instead of the head of the main phrase (e.g., metropolii  X  X etropolis X  was marked as the semantic head in: niedobr  X a dzielnic  X e jakiej  X  s wieloetnicznej metropolii  X  X ad quarter of a multi-ethnic metropolis X ). Similarly to most other Slavic languages, Polish grammar permits independent clauses to lack explicit subjects. The form of the null referent is then partially indicated by the morphology of the verb. We annotate such cases with identity links, as in (9) while other types of elliptic expressions are not linked, unlike in [10], cf. (10)-(11). (9) Maria wr X ci X a ju  X  z z Francji.  X  Sp  X edzi X a tam miesi  X ac. (10) Janek kupi X  du  X  ze pude X ko czekoladek, ale niewiele  X  ju  X  z zosta X o. (11) Czyta X e  X  s ksi  X a  X  zki Lema? Czyta X em  X . erence clusters containing at least one zero subject (26.89% of the total number of non-singleton clusters). Originally, we had excluded some types of pronouns (indefinite, negative, reflexive, interrogative) from the annotation on the assumption of their non-referentiality. Sur-prisingly, the analysis of the corpus showed that they can frequently form coreferential chains. Very often an indefinite pronoun is a subject of a verb sequence (in which the second verb is a zero subject verb), e.g.: (12) Jak kto  X  s jest zazdrosny, znaczy,  X  ze naprawd  X e  X  kocha. refers to indefinite pronoun used in the first clause, cf.: example below does not want to speak openly about the former director and uses the indefinite pronoun kogo  X  s  X  X omeone X  instead: (14) Po rezygnacji z pracy w szpitalu by X y dyrektor znikn  X a X  z  X  zycia publicznego. pronouns should have been allowed in coreference chains. We wish to reconsider this phenomenon at the end of the annotation process. It makes us think that the problem of coreference in the text might be somehow different than the one of the reference to the world. Maybe it should be examined as a separate phenomenon. For the purpose of measuring the inter-annotator agreement, a sample of the corpus (henceforth called the IAA-sample) was annotated independently by two annotators. More precisely, several annotators participated in the experiment but each text was an-notated by exactly two of them. The IAA-sample consisted of 210 texts selected so as to uniformly represent the 14 existing text genres (prose, press, dialogues, etc.). It contained 60674 tokens in total, i.e. about 12% of the whole corpus.
 tion remains a challenge [5]. Thus, we based our estimation on the F-measure (which does not take agreement by chance into account)  X  it amounted to 85.55% in the IAA-sample. Namely, the two annotators produced 20420 and 20560 mentions, respectively, and 17530 of them had identical borders in both sets (including the internal borders in case of discontinuous mentions). Further calculations, resumed in Table 1, take only those 17530 mentions into account whose borders were marked identically by both an-notators.
 lated for each text separately (because cross-document links are not allowed) and then averaged. For a single text the agreement was measured for the decisions on every pair of mentions (marked by both annotators) in the text  X  whether they were marked as near-identical or not. The probability of the annotator marking two mentions as near-identical was estimated for each text and annotator separately. If there were no near-identity links in a text its agreements was equal to 1. If however one annotator marked some near-identity links in a text and the other annotator marked no such link in the same text, the agreement for this text was 0 (because the expected agreement was the same as the observed agreement). The final result is very low  X  only 0.222. Frequently (128 times) a link was marked as near-identity by one annotator and as identity by the other. These figures prove the difficulty of reliably annotating near-identity links. non-singleton clusters which were identically designated by both annotators (among the identically delimited mentions). There were 6162 such clusters, out of which 4115 (about 66,78%) had the same dominant expression. If we count such proportion for only one mention from each cluster (as each cluster member has the same dominant expres-sion), for 1818 such cluster "representatives" 1146 mentions (63,04%) have the same dominant expression in both annotations. No chance-corrected analysis was conducted because the dominant expressions could have been entered by the annotators as free text, which jeopardizes the probability model of agreement by chance.
 corrected agreement (for identically delimited mentions). Uniform probability distribu-tion among all possible head choices was assumed and the S measure [17] was used. The observed agreement and the expected agreement were close to 99.05% and 68.32%, respectively. The former was quite high mainly because of the large number of men-tions consisting of only one token (therefore only one possible head). These two values yield the final S result of approximately 97.00%.
 of the identity clustering task, calculated according to the version of weighted Krippen-dorf X  X   X  [18] proposed by Passoneau in [19]. We have presented a detailed study of several particularly interesting phenomena re-lated to coreference annotation in an inflectionally rich language such as Polish. We have applied the novel concept of near-identity [14] on a large scale and we came to the conclusion that it cannot be reliably applied in coreference annotation. We also argue that semantic heads are more relevant to coreference than syntactic heads. We have in-troduced a novel idea of dominant expressions which represent the expressions carrying the biggest semantic load with respect to a reference cluster. These may be useful e.g. in cross-document coreference annotation. Finally, we have reviewed our previous convic-tion that indefinite, negative and other particular types of pronouns can never appear in coreference chains. We hope that all these observations may contribute to a high-quality methodology and usefulness of future coreference annotation projects, particularly in highly inflected languages.
