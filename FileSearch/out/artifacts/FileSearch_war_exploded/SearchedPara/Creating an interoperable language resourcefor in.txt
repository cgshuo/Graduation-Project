 Alex Chengyu Fang Abstract There are two different levels of interoperability for language resources: operational interoperability and conceptual interoperability. The former refers to the standardization of the formal aspects of language resources so that different resources can work together. The latter refers to the standardization of the notional representation of the semantic content of the analysis. This article addresses both issues but focuses on the latter through a description of the annotation and analysis of the International Corpus of English, which is a corpus for the study of English as a global language. The project is parameterised by component, regional sub-corpora and a set of pre-defined textual categories. The one-million-word British component has been constructed, grammatically tagged, and syntactically parsed. This article is first of all a description of steps taken to ensure conformity within the project. These include corpus design, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing. The article will then present a study that examines the use of adverbial clauses across speech and writing, illustrating the imminent necessity for interoperable analysis of linguistic data.
 Keywords Operational interoperability Conceptual interoperability Parsing Tagging Adverbial clause Speech Writing The International Corpus of English 1 Introduction According to Witt et al. ( 2009 ), language resource interoperability refers to the capability for such resources to interact or to work together. There are two different levels of interoperability for language resources: operational interoperability and conceptual interoperability. The former refers to the standardization of the formal aspects of language resources whereby annotations of different kinds can be easily applied to the resources and subsequently retrieved. The latter refers to the standardization of the semantic content of the analysis so that notional concepts, represented in the form of annotational symbols, refer to preferably identical analysis at textual, grammatical, syntactic and semantic levels. This article illustrates the former through an account of the construction and annotation of the International Corpus of English (ICE) and focuses on the issue of conceptual interoperability through an analysis of the adverbial clause based on ICE.

ICE is a project that aims at the construction of interoperable language resources that enable systematic investigations of the grammatical properties of English as a global language. In particular, it aims at the construction of a collection of corpora for countries and regions where English is used either as a majority first language (such as Australia, Britain and the US) or as an additional official language (such as India and Singapore; Greenbaum 1992 ). Each variety should be represented through 500 samples of 2,000 words each, both spoken and written by adults of 18 and above who have received formal education through the medium of English to the completion of secondary school. The project comprises over 20 national or regional teams, each dealing with a component corpus. For such an ambitious project, it was important to have a set of clearly defined criteria to guide through the various stages of the project regarding corpus design, corpus annotation, and corpus analysis in order to ensure conformity and hence interoperability. According to Greenbaum ( 1996 :5),  X  X  X or valid comparative studies the components of ICE need to follow the same design, to date from the same period, and to be processed and analysed in similar ways X  X .

The purpose of this article is two folded. It will first of all introduce the ICE project through issues related to corpus design and corpus annotation at grammatical and syntactic levels. It will then present a contrastive study of the use of adverbial clauses across speech and writing based on the British component of ICE. As will be shown, the results are contrary to previous findings. Explanations will be offered in the light of interoperable analysis issues. 2 Interoperable corpus design and annotation This section deals with the design of the corpus and the annotations applied to it. In particular, it will first describe the text composition of the corpus and then discuss POS tagging and syntactic parsing. 2.1 Corpus design The interoperability of the project was first handled at the level of corpus design. Each national or regional corpus was to be constructed according to an identical composition of text categories. Such a design is illustrated by Table 1 , which summarises the types of texts to be represented in the project. As can be see, the corpus contains both spoken and written material. The spoken section comprises dialogues and monologues. The former is represented by a register that changes from the less formal setting such as direct conversions to a more formal setting such as legal cross-examinations and business transactions. The latter ranges from unscripted speech to mixed and scripted speech. The written section can also be described according to a continuum that starts from non-printed material comprising student essays and social letters to published and hence necessarily polished language used in both learned and popular writings. 2.2 The ICE wordclass annotation scheme The second measure taken to ensure interoperability within ICE for its subsequent analysis was the design of a standard scheme for word-class analysis. This standard is maintained through both a written manual (Greenbaum and Ni 1996 ) and an automatic part-of-speech (POS) tagging system that automatically applies such a standard to electronic texts (Fang 1996a ). There are altogether 22 head tags and 71 features in the ICE wordclass tagging scheme, resulting in about 270 grammatically possible combinations. They cover all the major English word classes and provide morphological, grammatical, and collocational information. A typical ICE tag has two components: the head tag and its features that bring out the grammatical features of the associated word. For instance, N(com,sing) indicates that the lexical item associated with this tag is a common ( com) singular ( sing) noun ( N) .
Tags that indicate phrasal collocations include PREP(phras) and ADV(phras) , prepositions (as in [1]) and adverbs (as in [2]) that are frequently used in collocation with certain verbs and adjectives: [1] Thus the dogs X  behaviour had been changed because they associated the bell [2] I had been filming The Paras at the time, and Brian had had to come down to
Some tags, such as PROFM(so,cl) (pronominal so representing a clause as in [3]) and PRTCL(with) (particle with as in [4]), indicate the presence of a clause; so in [3] signals an abbreviated clause while with in [4] a non-finite clause: [3] If so, I X  X l come and meet you at the station. [4] The number by the arrows represents the order of the pathway causing
Examples [5] X  X 7] illustrate tags that note special sentence structures. There in [5] is tagged as EXTHERE, existential there that indicates a marked sentence order. [6] is an example of the cleft sentence (which explicitly marks the focus), where it is tagged as CLEFTIT . Example [7] exemplifies anticipatory it, which is tagged as ANTIT : [5] There were two reasons for the secrecy. [6] It is from this point onwards that Roman Britain ceases to exist and the history [7] Before trying to answer the question it is worthwhile highlighting briefly some
The verb class is divided into auxiliaries and lexical verbs. The auxiliary class notes modals, perfect auxiliaries, passive auxiliaries, semi-auxiliaries, and semip-auxiliaries (those followed by -ing verbs). The lexical verbs are further annotated according to their complementation types. There are altogether seven types: complex-transitive, complex-ditransitive, copular, dimonotransitive, ditransitive, intransitive, monotransitive, and TRANS . Figure 1 shows the sub-categorisations of the verb class.

The notation TRANS of the transitive verb class is used in the ICE project to tag those transitive verbs followed by a noun phrase that may be the subject of the following non-finite clause. This type of verb can be analysed differently according to various tests into, for instance, monotransitives, ditransitives and complex transitives. To avoid arbitrary decisions, the complementing non-finite clause is assigned a catch-all term  X  X ransitive complement X  in parsing, and its preceding verb is accordingly tagged as TRANS in order to avoid making a decision on its transitivity type. This verb type is best demonstrated by [8] X  X 11]: [8] Just before Christmas, the producer of Going Places, Irene Mallis, had asked [9] They make others feel guilty and isolate them. [10] I can buy batteries for the tape  X  but I can see myself spending a fortune! [11] The person who booked me in had his eyebrows shaved and replaced by
In examples [8] X  X 11], asked, make, see, and had are all complemented by non-finite clauses with overt subjects, the main verbs of these non-finite clauses being infinitive, present participle and past participle.

As illustrated by examples [1] X  X 11], the ICE tagging scheme has indeed gone beyond the wordclass to provide some syntactic information and has thus proved itself to be an expressive and powerful means of pre-processing for subsequent parsing.

The ICE tagging scheme is automatically applied by AUTASYS, a part-of-speech tagging system that is fast (over one million words per minute), accurate (over 96 % accuracy) and robust. See Fang ( 1996a ) for more detailed descriptions. 2.3 The ICE parsing scheme The third step taken to ensure interoperability is the design of a parsing scheme that handles the analysis of the corpus at syntactic level. This step is reinforced through an automatic system that applies the annotation scheme to texts that have already been POS tagged (Fang 1996b and 2000 ). The automatically produced sentences as parsed trees were then subject to manual manipulation through a graphical tree editor that maximally helps the editing of the trees through linguistically licensed constraints on category-function combinations. The ICE parsing scheme recognises five basic syntactic categories. They are adjective phrase ( AJP ), adverb phrase ( AVP ), noun phrase ( NP ), prepositional phrase ( PP ), and verb phrase ( VP ). Each tree in the ICE parsing scheme is represented as a functionally labelled hierarchy, with features describing the characteristics of each constituent, which is represented as a pair of function-category labels. In the case of a terminal node, the function-category descriptive labels are appended by the lexical item itself in curly brackets. Figure 2 is such a structure for [12]. [12] We will be introducing new exam systems for both schools and universities.
According to Fig. 2 , we know that [12] is a parsing unit ( PU ) realised by a clause ( CL ), which governs three daughter nodes: SU NP (NP as subject), VB VP (VP as verbal), and OD NP (NP as direct object). Each of the three daughter nodes are sub-branched until the leaves nodes with the input tokens in curly brackets. The direct object node, for example, has three immediate constituents: NPPR AJP (AJP as NP pre-modifier), NPHD N(com,plu) (plural common noun as the NP head), and NPPO PP (PP as NP post-modifier).

Note that in the same example, the head of the complementing NP of the prepositional phrase is initially analysed as a coordinated construct ( COORD ), with two plural nouns as the conjoins ( CJ ) and a coordinating conjunction as coordinator ( COOR ).

The ICE parsing scheme can be automatically applied to large quantities of natural text by the Survey Parser, a syntactic parsing system that is fast (over 50,000 words per minute), accurate (over 80 % accuracy) and robust, producing either a full parse or a partial analysis without crashing. See Fang ( 1996b , 2000 , 2008 ) for more detailed descriptions. 3 Interoperable linguistic studies The ICE corpus is thus an interoperable language resource that will maximally enable interoperable linguistic studies in, for instance, the grammatical differences and similarities of varieties of English. Since this resource is annotated according to grammatical and syntactic schemes that are theory neutral, it will also allow for comparisons with other resources.

In what follows, a study will be presented that aims at the investigation of the use of adverbial clauses across speech and writing based on the British component of ICE (ICE X  X B). Results of the investigation will be presented and discussed in the light of findings of past studies. The experiments examined the frequency distribution of finite adverbial clauses as well as the non-finite ones (infinitival, present participial, and past participial) in ICE X  X B. There are three procedures. First, the experiment aimed to establish the overall distribution of adverbial clauses across the spoken and the written sections. Secondly, samples of spontaneous and prepared speech were examined to ascertain whether preparedness could be seen as a continuum of changes for the use of adverbial clauses. Finally, samples of timed and untimed university essays were used to validate the hypothesis that adverbial clauses also demonstrate a predictable variation as a function of degrees of preparedness in written English. 3.1 Uses of adverbial clauses across speech and writing As a first step, the complete corpus was used to obtain empirical indications of the different uses of adverbial clauses across speech and writing. Frequencies of occurrence were respectively collected from the spoken and the written sections of ICE X  X B. The statistics include the total number of sentences and clauses in these two sections. Statistics were also collected for the total number of sentences involving the use of adverbial clauses and the exact number of adverbial clauses in these two sections. Two proportions were calculated: the total number of sentences with at least one adverbial clause over the total number of sentences, and the total number of adverbial clauses over the total number of sentences. The former indicates the proportion of sentences in ICE X  X B that make use of adverbial clauses. The latter shows the proportion of adverbial clauses in the corpus since there often are multiple adverbial clauses in one sentence or utterance and it is useful to have such an indication. These two proportions thus indicate how often adverbial clauses are used and how complex the sentence structure is (assuming that structural complexity can be measured in terms of clause subordination). Table 2 summarises the results.

Initial results indicate that the uses of adverbial clauses are more frequent in writing than in speech. As Table 2 clearly indicates, a much higher proportion of sentences in writing make use of adverbial clauses. To be exact, adverbial clauses are more than twice likely to occur in writing than in speech. In writing, 25.42 % of the sentences make use of adverbial clauses in contrast to only 12.49 % of the sentences with an adverbial clause in speech. The same difference can be observed in terms of the number of adverbial clauses: there are over 30 adverbial clauses per one hundred sentences in writing compared with fewer than 15 adverbial clauses per one hundred sentences in speech. Note that the proportions are normalised according to the number of sentences and clauses. It makes more sense in terms of sentences rather than words but even in terms of words speech demonstrates a smaller proportion of adverbial clauses than writing. As a general guide, there are 600,000 words in the spoken section of the corpus and 400,000 words in the written section. In terms of words, therefore, there are 1.46 adverbial clauses per hundred words in speech, compared with 1.86 in writing. 3.2 Types of adverbial clauses across speech and writing The distribution of different types of adverbial clauses was investigated in order to verify that the observed difference was not the result of a skewed use of any one particular type. The second experiment examined the distribution of finite adverbial clauses with an overt subordinator and the non-finite ones, which include infinitival, present participial and past participial adverbial clauses. They are illustrated respectively by examples [13] X  X 16] with the relevant sections underlined. [13] And I think the question is bigger than that because it X  X  from both sides. [14] Having said that, I can really only say how it was for me when I came to [15] And you condemn the series having seen a bit of one of them. &lt;#S1A-006-[16] The actual work surface was a very thick piece of wood, dumped on top, all
The results are summarized in Table 3 . As can be clearly seen, this second experiment also indicates that written samples of the ICE corpus make much more extensive use of the adverbial clause, be it finite, infinitival, or participial. The finite ones occur twice as many times in writing than in speech. For the other three types of adverbial clauses, the proportion for the written genre is even higher than for the spoken genre. Consider the infinitival clauses, for example. In writing, they are nearly three times more likely to be used than in spoken discourse (5.43 vs 1.98 %), largely echoing previous observations that writing is characterised by a higher content of infinitives compared with spoken English. This proportion is even greater with the other two types of non-finite adverbial clauses.

We may incidentally note that past participial clauses are the least frequent type of adverbial clauses, with only 141 found in speech and 248 in writing in the whole corpus. 3.3 Types of adverbial clauses across spontaneous and prepared speech Empirical indications thus suggest that adverbial clauses are a marked characteristic of the written genre, in line with non-finite clauses that also characterise writing. However, to conclude that this difference in terms of use is due to different levels of elaboration, we need further empirical evidence. We need to demonstrate that such variations can be observed not only across speech and writing, but also within the spoken and the written sections as a function of varying degrees of elaboration. To this end, a sub-corpus of 180,000 words was created with S1A texts in ICE-GB, representing spontaneous private conversations. A second sub-corpus was also created, this time with the first 40 texts in S2B, representing talks prepared and scripted for public broadcast. These two genres thus may be seen as forming a continuum between what was unprepared and what was carefully prepared, therefore a measure of different degrees of elaboration.

The results are summarised in Table 4 , where we can read that, as an example, the subcorpus of spontaneous conversations contains a total number of 1,574 sentences that make use of finite adverbial clauses, accounting for 5.34 % of the total number of sentences in the sub-corpus. On the other end of the continuum, as another example, we duly observe a higher proportion of finite adverbial clauses, that is, 12.81 % in terms of sentences and 13.53 % in terms of clauses. It is important to note that this general trend can be observed for all of the different types of adverbial clauses.

It is thus reasonable to suggest that within speech the proportion of adverbial clauses increases as a function of degrees of elaboration, formality, and preparedness. 3.4 Types of adverbial clauses across timed and untimed essays Having established that in speech the proportion of adverbial clauses is largely a function of elaboration or formality or preparedness, we want to do the same for the written samples. We want to argue, on empirical basis, that adverbial clauses not only mark a spoken-written division, that they also mark a continuum between what is spontaneous and what is scripted in speech, and that they also mark a degree of preparedness in writing.

Conveniently, the ICE-GB corpus contains a category coded W1A, which includes 20 texts evenly divided into two sets. Both sets were unpublished essays written by university students. The only difference is that the first set was written within a pre-designated period of time while the second set comprises samples written without the time constraint. If the higher use of adverbial clauses were indeed the result of a higher degree of elaboration or preparedness, then we would observe more uses in the untimed set than in the timed set. This consideration led to a third experiment, whose results are summarised in Table 5 .

Again, we duly observed a consistent increase in the proportion of adverbial clauses from one end of the continuum, timed essays, to the other end of the continuum, untimed essays. For instance, we observe that there are 16.18 finite adverbial clauses per 100 sentences for the timed essays. The untimed essays make more uses of finite adverbial clauses, 22.47 per 100 sentences. The same trend can be observed for all of the different types of adverbial clauses, except the infinitival ones. 62 sentences were observed to contain a total of 65 adverbial clauses in timed essays. In the untimed essays, 61 sentences were found to use a total of 64 infinitival adverbial clauses. While the differences are only marginal and can be dismissed as occasional, this group of texts will be examined in a future study for a possible relation between text types and uses of infinitival clauses.

For the purpose of the current study, it can be observed that in the untimed essays as a whole 31.64 % of the sentences made use of adverbial clauses, almost 4.5 % higher than 27.15 % for the timed group. The results thus support the suggestion that within writing the proportion of adverbial clauses indicates different degrees of preparedness in terms of time. 3.5 Discussions We have thus observed that, in the first place, adverbial clauses mark a division between spoken and written English in the sense that the spoken samples have a lower proportion of adverbial clauses than the written samples. This is true not only for finite adverbial clauses but non-finite ones, including infinitival, present participial and past participial constructions. Secondly, the experiments also produced empirical evidence that the frequency distribution of adverbial clauses follows a predictable and regular growth curve from spontaneous conversations to scripted public speeches. The same trend can be observed from within the written sample themselves, where the proportion of adverbial clauses in general increase from timed essays to untimed essays. As Fig. 3 clearly demonstrates, 1 the proportion of adverbial clauses per 100 sentences in ICE-GB consistently increases along a continuum between spontaneous conversations and untimed university essays. What is remarkably surprising is the fact that the occurrence of adverbial clauses in spontaneous conversations accounts for only about 7.5 % of the utterances. What is equally surprising is that the occurrence of adverbial clauses in untimed university essays accounts for over 35 % of the sentences, over 4.6 times as much as that in speech. The sharp contrast between speech and writing shown in Fig. 3 argues strongly against the claims of past studies.

The graph also shows the average proportions of adverbial clauses in the two modes are nicely situated between the two sections within the same continuum. First of all, the average proportion of adverbial clauses in speech is shown in the figure to be between spontaneous conversations and scripted public speeches, suggesting a consistent increase in speech along the  X  X reparedness X  register. In the written section of the continuum, the average proportion of adverbial clauses in writing rests between timed and untimed essays, again suggesting a consistent increase, continuing the trend from the spoken section, along the  X  X reparedness X  register.
While it is evident from Fig. 3 that speech and writing demonstrate a vast difference in terms of the use of adverbial clauses, it is clear at the same time that adverbial clauses are not as much a factor of speech vs writing division as a degree of preparedness in discourse. To be exact, it is acceptable to suggest on the basis of empirical evidence that degrees of information elaboration dictate the proportion of adverbial clauses: the more elaborate the sample (defined in terms of preparedness), the more adverbial clauses. The results are thus significantly different from those past studies such as Thompson ( 1984 ) and Biber ( 1988 ). 4 Conclusions To conclude, this article first of all described the design, construction and annotation of an interoperable resource, ICE, to enable interoperable linguistic studies. Interoperability was ensured at different key stages of the project through standard annotation schemes and automatic systems that apply these schemes. The article then described a linguistic investigation into the use of adverbial clauses across speech and writing on the basis of ICE X  X B that has been grammatically tagged and syntactically parsed. The detailed syntactic annotation of the corpus and manual validation of the analysis ensured that adverbial clauses could be accurately retrieved. Results suggest that, contrary to claims by past studies, the proportion of adverbial clauses is generally lower in speech than in writing. It is also shown that adverbial clauses do not simply mark a division between the spoken and written genres. Empirical evidence also suggests that the proportion of adverbial clauses is also a function of varying degrees of preparedness, which can be independently demonstrated from within the spoken and written genres. It is thus reasonable to postulate that the spoken-written division is perhaps better perceived as a continuum of preparedness, from spontaneous private conversations at one extreme to untimed carefully prepared writing at the other, along which the proportion of adverbial clauses consistently change in a predictable fashion.

It is not yet obvious how to account for the different results regarding the use of adverbial clauses across speech and writing. One possible explanation is accuracy of analysis: past studies largely used hand analysed data or automatically analysed data without manual validation. A second possible explanation may have to do with different definitions of the adverbial clause. Temporal prepositions like before and after are often complemented by gerundial clauses. Such constructions are analysed as prepositional phrases according to ICE manuals but may have been treated as adverbial clauses in some of the past studies. This possibility demonstrates the necessity for use of standardised terminologies in language resources that are truly interoperable. For this matter, language resources that have been treated for both operational interoperability and conceptual interoperability will form a powerful instrument for truly interoperable linguistic studies.
