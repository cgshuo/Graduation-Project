 In this paper, we investigate the interplay of distance and tie strength through an examination of 20 million geo-encoded tweets collected from Twitter and 6 million user profiles. Concretely, we investigate the relationship between the strength of the tie between a pair of users, and the distance between the pair. We identify several factors  X  including following, mentioning, and actively engaging in conversations with an-other user  X  that can strongly reveal the distance between a pair of users. We find a bimodal distribution in Twit-ter, with one peak around 10 miles from people who live nearby, and another peak around 2500 miles, further validat-ing Twitter X  X  use as both a social network (with geograph-ically nearby friends) and as a news distribution network (with very distant relationships).

Online social networks are increasingly getting  X  X eograph-ical. X  Millions of online social network users are voluntarily sharing their location through location sharing services like Foursquare, short text status updates through real-time mi-croblogs, and photos in online image hosts. This location in-formation is increasingly being incorporated in social media for providing localized content, location-aware recommen-dations, and other geo-spatial enabled services. The access to the trails and connections among millions of social media users provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the relationship between the geographical properties of social media users and the social relations connecting them. Figure 1: Smoothed histogram of distance to users for different types of relationships. The dotted black line was created by calculating the distance between random, unrelated users.

The study of geographical properties of online social media users has drawn intensive attention in recent years. Char-acterizing network properties in relation to local geography has been studied in [7]. Lindqvist [5] analyzed how and why people use location sharing services, and discussed the pri-vacy issues related to location sharing services. Scellato et al. [6] used data from three location based social networks to investigate the relationship between distance and loca-tion, and they show that connections are not purely caused by geographical or social factors. Instead, the show that it is a mix of the two. We know of two previous systems that attempted to estimate the location of users on social networking sites: [1] and [2].

In this paper, we extend these works by investigating the interplay of distance and tie strength through a fine-grained examination of 20 million geo-encoded tweets and 6 million user profiles collected from Twitter. Concretely, we investi-gate the relationship between the strength of the tie between a pair of users and the distance between the pair. We iden-tify several factors  X  including following, mentioning, and actively engaging in conversations with another user  X  that can strongly reveal the distance between a pair of users. We find a bimodal distribution in the distance between Twitter users, with one peak around 10 miles from people who live nearby, and another peak around 2500 miles, fur-ther validating Twitter X  X  use as both a social network (with geographically nearby friends) and as a news distribution network (with very distant relationships). Figure 1 gives a preview of this bimodal distribution for four basic types of relationships. The red curve represents a strong, reciprocal friendship whereas the cyan line represents a relatively weak relationship. The red curve has more users at a distance of ten miles than the cyan line, indicating that reciprocal friendships are more likely to be local.
To investigate how social relation and geographical dis-tance between the relations correlate, we sample a dataset from Twitter. We first define a few terms to simplify the process of explaining how the data was collected. Contacts are defined to be the set of a user X  X  friends, followers, and people who a user mentioned in her tweets (i.e., people the user speaks to). Twitter does not provide a mechanism to determine who mentioned a given user. Thus, only one-directional conversation is considered.

Any given contact can be categorized into precisely one of these four disjoint sets: reciprocal friend The geo-located user follows this user just friend The geo-located user follows this user and is just follower The geo-located user is followed by this user, just mentioned The users do not follow each other, but
We built a crawler to find these contacts for users who used Twitter X  X  Location Feature to disclose their location. The crawler sampled 19,877,804 geo-coded tweets by moni-toring Twitter X  X  public Streaming API between April 7 until April 16, 2011. In the dataset, users are filtered who have strict privacy settings, have neither friends nor followers, or posted fewer than two tweets in the sampled dataset. For each user in the geo-coded tweets, we use the median lati-tude and median longitude of locations of the user X  X  tweets as an approximation of her home location. Some Twitter accounts, such as accounts that posted jobs, would move around faster than a human could possibly move. To ac-count for this, the crawler calculated the distance between each tweet and the user X  X  home location. The crawler ig-nored users if the median distance from their tweets to their home location was greater than 50 miles.

Users are considered to be in the US based on a simple bounding box, yielding 104,214 geo-located users. For all of the geo-located users with a home location in the US, the crawler used Twitter X  X  API to download the users X  friends, followers, and 100 most recent tweets. The crawler also downloaded the profiles for up to 2000 friends, followers, and people they mention in their tweets. If they had over 2000, it chose a random sample of 2000 profiles that included at least 25 of each of the four categories listed below. From the profiles, the crawler kept the users with a decodable lo-cation field and threw away the rest. From what was left,
The crawler and scripts used for the investigation are avail-able online: https://github.com/jeffamcgee/friendloc Figure 2: CDF of distance from geo-located users to users they have some contact with. The curves in this figure are the integrals of the curve in Figure 1. the crawler randomly picked one Friend, one Follower, one Just Mentioned, and up to seven reciprocal friends. For each of these contacts, the crawler stored their friends, followers, and 100 most recent tweets.

We additionally geocoded each user X  X  location field through a combination of extracting latitude/longitude coordinates via regular expression and by using Gisgraphy, which does full-text search on the GeoNames database using Lucene.
In this section, we investigate how various types of con-tacts correlate with proximity. All of the analysis in this section was done on the contacts of 104,214 users with a home location inside the US bounding box.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function(CDF) of the distance between a geo-located user and several types of contacts. Distance is plotted on a logarithmic scale to show both local and global effects.

In general, reciprocal friends are the closest, followed by followers, friends, and finally users who are just mentioned. 34% of reciprocal friends live within 25 miles while only 18% of users who are just mentioned live within that radius. While it may seem that since being followed by someone and following someone should be identical, they are not. Celebrity and news accounts on Twitter often have large numbers of followers, but they normally do not follow a large number of users. Since the geo-located user was se-lected randomly, they are usually an average user and not a celebrity. If they follow someone, it might be a celebrity; however, if someone follows them, it is probably someone who knows them.

There is a strange corner in the top right corner of all the graphs at approximately 2500-2750 miles. This is caused by the large population living on the coast, and the minus-cule number of people posting tweets from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
To understand the distribution of contacts, we created a smoothed histogram. First, the distances between contacts are sorted into 200 logarithmically scaled bins (40 bins for each power of 10). Next, the curve is smoothed by convo-luting it with a seven element triangular window. Figure 1 (on page 1) shows the result of plotting the smoothed his-togram. All four types of contacts follow roughly the same bimodal distribution: one peak around 10 miles from people who live nearby, and another peak around 2500 miles, which is approximately the distance from coast to coast.

The geo-located users and their reciprocal friends were shuffled so that they would be paired with someone who was probably not their friend and then calculated the distance between the pair. The dotted black line shows the results of this procedure. For distances greater than around five hundred miles, the red line and the black line have roughly the same shape, which suggests that people when people are far away, their physical location no longer matters. The random line also has a similar shape to the other curves for distances greater than 100 miles.

One reasonable explanation for this is that Twitter is not just a social network; it is also a news distribution network (echoing the findings in [4]). This bimodal distribution sug-gests that users have two types of contacts: people who they met in real life, and people who they met online or know about via mainstream media. The former group is useful for predicting location and the latter group is not.
Figure 3 shows the relationship between various types of communication patterns between the geo-located users and their contacts. Each of the four graphs visualize the same number of edges on the social graph with the exception of the Just Mentioned graph. Approximately one-third of our geo-located users never mentioned someone who was not a friend or a follower, so the sample size is smaller.
In almost every case, increased communication increases the probability that two users live near each other. There is one exception: when an average user mentions someone they follow who does not follow them back, it has no effect. In other words, if a random user mentions a celebrity who does not bother to reply, they probably do not live in the same area. This can be seen by the blue and green lines that are right on top of each other in the Just Friend graph. On the other hand, in the rare event that someone who is just a friend replies to their follower, then the probability that they live near each other is much higher.

The weakest type of contact is for users who were just mentioned, but never replied to, but if the person is men-tioned, then 31% of users with no friend/follow relationship who have a conversation live within 25 miles. This is ap-proximately equal to the 31% of reciprocal friends who ig-nore each other and live within 25 miles. Unsurprisingly, the strongest type of connection is reciprocal friends who communicate.
Like many social networks, Twitter allows users to mark their account as protected. The specifics differ from network to network, but in Twitter X  X  case a user has to be approved to follow a protected user. There are demographic differ-ences between public and protected accounts. For example, Gilbert [3] demonstrates that rural users are more likely to make their accounts private than public accounts. In the case of protected accounts on Twitter, basic information Figure 4: Solid lines represent protected accounts, and dashed lines represent public accounts. If a user follows a protected account, they tend to be closer. Figure 5: Comparison between distance to a mu-tual friend, labeled  X  X ur X , and someone who is not a mutual friend, labeled  X  X y X . about their profile such as their location and the number of friends and followers is public, but their friends list, fol-lowers list, and the text of their tweets is private, and not available for analysis.

Figure 4 shows the effect of protected accounts on prox-imity. The most dramatic difference between private and public occurs if a user follows a protected account. Since users generally only allow people they know to follow a pro-tected account, this brings the users almost as close together as if they were reciprocal friends. On the other hand, if a protected account follows the geo-located user, this is almost insignificant. In this section, we turn our attention to triangles of users. Finding useful relationships between the edges of a social tri-angle is tricky because the three distances depend on each other. Unfortunately, it is fairly simple to show using the triangle inequality that if two users are 1000 miles apart, then the third member of the triangle has to be at least 500 miles from one of the other two. Since this isn X  X  a useful result, we designed a more complex experiment to analyze the relationship between the sides of the triangle. A script searched for a specific pattern in the social network of the reciprocal friends. It needed four users who fit the following criteria: (i)  X  X e X  is the geo-located user; (ii)  X  X ou X  is recip-rocal friends with  X  X e X ; (iii)  X  X y X  has no relationship with  X  X ou X  and is reciprocal friends with  X  X e X ; and (iv)  X  X ur X  is reciprocal friends with both  X  X e X  and  X  X ou X . It found this pattern in 57152 of the users in the training set. If a user had multiple instances of this pattern, it picked one of them randomly so that particular users would not bias the results.
Figure 5 shows a comparison between the  X  X y X  users and the  X  X ur X  users. For each of the  X  X y X  users and the  X  X ur X  users, we put them into one of four logarithmically scaled bins based on their distance from the  X  X ou X  user. Then we plot the CDF for the distance to  X  X e X  for each user in the set. This allows us to investigate the effect of mutual friendship on distance. We report one very simple result: if two of your friends are close (within 10 miles), then whether they know each other or not is strongly affects how close you are to them. If they are farther apart, it doesn X  X  matter.
We demonstrated that some types of relationships tend to be closer than others, identified some features of rela-tionships that are correlated with physical proximity, and investigated how social triangles relate to physical location. Our analysis showed that people who have stronger ties such as reciprocal friendship and reciprocal communication are more likely to live near each other than people who have weak ties.

We are currently working on using the results of this paper to build a system for location prediction. We may be able to combine the results of tie strength with other factors such as the words users choose to use as described by Cheng [2]. [1] L. Backstrom, E. Sun, and C. Marlow.
