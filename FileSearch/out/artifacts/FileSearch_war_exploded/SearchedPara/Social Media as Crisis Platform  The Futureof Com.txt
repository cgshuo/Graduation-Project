 REBECCA GOOLSBY Office of Naval Research 1. INTRODUCTION
Social media provides the means for creating new communities and for reen-ergizing old communities as anyone who has looked up old high school pals on Facebook can attest. Recent events, however, point to the creation of a new kind of quickly formulated, potentially powerful community X  X he ad-hoc crisis community, which is made possible by new social media that supports  X  X rowd-sourcing X  approaches [Howe 2008] to addressing complex problems. Ad-hoc crisis communities form on-the-fly as existing social media communities, news organizations, and users converge in social media spaces in response to sudden tragedies.

The first such instance of this occurred in 2008 in India. During the ter-rorist attacks on Mumbai [Goolsby 2009], Twitter users traded information, requested help, looked for people feared to be caught at one of the attack sites, and even documented the situation; one individual X  X   X  X hoto stream X  to the photograph-sharing site, Flickr, was picked up by international news organiza-tions. More uses of this followed, particularly with the spread of the Ushahidi platform 1 , a Google map-based  X  X ash up X  designed for geo-located responses to crisis. After the earthquake in Haiti on 12 January, 2010, the non-profit or-ganization Ushahidi.org set up a Haitian operation and recruited hundreds of volunteers to help translate messages. In the Ushahidi Haiti map, people and organizations in Haiti post their needs on the crisis map; requests are picked up by volunteers who answer them according to their ability. 2. THE PROBLEM WITH SOCIAL MEDIA
Social media technologies have caused considerable alarm in many organiza-tions for a number of reasons, such as their potential to serve as an avenue for security threats such as viruses and Trojans, and concern for a pristine information environment to prevent actions from being taken based on inac-curate, unsourced, and questionable information, especially in agencies that have police or public service responsibilities. The result is that many agen-cies ban social media. Recently, the U.S. Marine Corps was  X  X etweeted X  that is access to any social media site is banned according to a one-year instruction
Marine Corps authorities cited their main fear to be malicious malware attacks through these social sites.

Uses of social media are not always benign. In 2009, police arrested a G20 activist, Elliot Madison, for tweeting police activities to demonstrators at the G20 protests in Pittsburgh. 3
From the point-of-the view of the Pittsburgh police, assisting lawbreakers is prosecutable by law, no matter what medium one uses. Technology is changing the rules and challenging the laws.

Geographically-aware social media applications, or  X  X o-so apps X  (location-social) are a new source of concern. If the bad guys know where the police or their intended victims are, then this could facilitate crimes, particularly stalking. Even in the world of fragile states, phone texting is used for intimida-tion (reportedly in Afghanistan) and as a means for warlords to organize their followers (in Somalia). The  X  X witteros X  along the Mexican border use Twitter to avoid the border police and there have also been reports of people using Twitter to avoid police checkpoints for sobriety 5 . As the technology facilitates changes in the information available, so too does it enable new forms of strategic and tactical behavior. Social media, says sociologist Brian Solis [2007], is about so-ciology, not technology. Understanding how people are likely to change their behavior as a result of these new information sources is an expanding area for social research. 3. SOCIAL MEDIA AS CRISIS PLATFORM
Twitter has become a crisis platform by accident. Authorities have been left
Twitter is chaos, rather than order, it is free-form and torrential and really very poorly equipped to assist in a crisis (note how Madison and his cohorts had to cobble together maps and phones and police scanners). All sorts of other social media can be jury-rigged for crisis management even at the very small and personal scale (witness how people use social media to network for jobs in the current economic downturn). But the result of this jury-rigging is pretty much a kludge X  X ifficult to use, inefficient, and incoherent. Compared to Twitter,  X  X risis commons X  social media that are currently being developed (like
Ushahidi) must develop the capacity to create order out of chaos this kludge. Detailed street maps on the Haiti Ushahidi site are the result of the Ushahidi effort of recruiting volunteers to create the street maps and organize crisis information. 4. CRISIS MAPS: AN EVOLUTIONARY TYPOLOGY
Military and public safety organizations have long been consumers of GIS systems and other kinds of electronic maps. Police and rescue units need them; places like Tokyo, where a major earthquake has long been expected, also demand them. Social platforms like Twitter and Facebook are not realistic resources for the information needs of first responders. The learning curve is high, the torrent of information they deliver is difficult to navigate, and there are few controls or methods to validate and verify information that is delivered through these systems. Users at first-responder agencies have long held to the notion that information provided by tools must be authoritative; failure to provide correct data can cost lives. Social media has had an impact on the zero-tolerance attitudes towards less-than-certain information now that information tools can also provide situation updates on-the-fly. The paradigm of  X  X nformation as flow X  is becoming more interesting and compelling to first responder agencies now that the socio-technical tools are being developed that can freshen their reservoirs with new information that is timely and actionable.
Single-organization map visualizations have long been used for operational planning purposes. This sort of map has its roots in the ancient sandbox technique made famous by Napoleon Bonaparte where boxes of sand were used to map out enemy positions and plans of attack. In modern times, first responders have typically used paper maps and push-pins as information re-sources, usually for close-hold sensitive data such as crime maps. Electronic versions of these maps have been developed but they are expensive, they have interfaces that are not intuitive, and they are relegated to a command center rather than available in the briefing room or on the street.

The most recent entrant to the social media field is the public-access crisis map, exemplified by the Ushahidi platform. It is open source, therefore easily adoptable by any agency or group no matter how small. Developed by a Kenyan activist, Ushahidi is a simple open-source solution for the developing world, originally designed to help activists blow the whistle on election fraud. Used in Kenya, Mexico, and Afghanistan, Ushahidi platforms provide the ability to accept text messages from a variety of sources such as phones, the Internet, email, and even other social media platforms like Twitter. (Other uses for Ushahidi include wildlife tracking, H1N1 monitoring and a host of other uses.).
Users can also post photographs and videos to back up their claims of voter fraud (Ushahidi means  X  X estimony X  in Swahili). Each message is placed on the map as a flag that becomes a bigger and bigger blob as more reports pour in.
Clicking on the blob brings up the message reports, the photos, and videos associated with that location.
 The Afghan organization,  X  X ajhok News, X  went one step further, using the
Ushahidi platform to create not just a map but something that is more like a community  X  X ash up X  that is, collections of data drawn from many sources into one framework. Originally posted for the 2009 election, the Alive in Afghanistan (AiA) map (an instance of the Ushahidi platform) serves multiple functions: announcing successful projects, providing public service messages about local problems and issues, and even providing a platform for community members to safely and anonymously speak out. 7
The AiA mash up could be organized more efficiently. The default maps shows all posts, rather than recent ones, making it difficult to tell new news from old from the map alone X  X he user can specify the timeline they wish to see, but it is not an intuitive interface. The category filters must be clicked to make any sense of the map at all, and before long, even that won X  X  help un-less some sort of order is imposed. Jeff Howe [2008] notes that crowdsourced information resources require a benevolent dictator to help impose order and guide the community. One of the most interesting facts about the AiA mash up is that it demonstrates something critical: a good crisis media resource should provide the public with understandable, intuitive tools and a means of familiarizing its audience with those tools. Regular news can produce trust.
The  X  X ews of the day X  posts enable users to stay connected to the tool even when there are no pressing crises on the immediate horizon. When a crisis pops up, not only is the tool available, but its user/audience community can easily pick it up and implement it just as they did when hijacking Twitter for crisis communications. Familiarity with the tool X  X  use makes it a natu-ral solution for dealing with crises because of the trust built through regular interaction.

Community maps are a natural extension of crisis maps just as crisis media is a natural extension of social media. Communities coalesce in social media (if one is successful), and, in a pinch, people turn to communities they trust for help and support. And, even in crisis, people look to each other for community, perhaps especially in crisis. The AiA map does not provide for personal iden-tity features and, owing to the potential dangers in Afghanistan afforded by others knowing one X  X  activities, this is a positive thing. In this case, anonymity may help improve trust. In other settings, identity issues may become more important in encouraging trust among strangers. This is also seen as a poten-tial drawback for first responder authorities who want to know the source of information before committing resources and prefer to have more accountable methods to validate information. 5. THE FUTURE OF CRISIS MAPS: WHAT AGENCIES NEED
The AiA map is not quite an interagency map; it is primarily a means of com-munication among the various agency and corporate users. A true interagency crisis map resource would not only allow organizations to share information, but also to collaborate, plan, and execute shared missions. Current interagency maps are usually based on highly proprietary software and have little or no capacity to gather data via cellphone handsets. These maps are designed to share (some) information between or among organizations if they share the same platform or have some data structure in common.

First responders need a platform that can help update them on the ground and which they can update easily and quickly from the frontlines. As new first responders come into the crisis situation, one of the biggest problems they face is the confusion of noise. What situations are current? What situations have been handled? What has been happening in the half hour before they became part of the equation? In the haiti.ushahidi.com platform, people generally did not send messages to say their request has been fulfilled. Ushahidi has no way of knowing how successful it has been or how the situation had changed unless someone posts an update, which is a rare occurrence.

Currently, information management in first responder organizations is han-dled through debriefs between shifts or from the dispatch office; in the press for time, only the big picture is provided, with many of the details left out.
Many first responder organizations today are interested in the development of map-based information systems to provide an overview of the situation that is enduring, detailed, and easy to manage. As situations resolve, they could melt down into a history layer so that the next shift can take a look at what has already happened since this might have residual impacts on the current environment.

A second key innovation in the Ushahidi approach is the focus on public involvement. A number of other crisis maps exist at various agencies, particu-larly at the state and federal levels, but none of them offer the public a means to report in, ask for help, or offer assistance. In the United States alone, the catastrophic floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, mudslides, and even traf-fic accidents that occur could be addressed in social media; news agencies all over the world now offer platforms to citizen journalists to provide eyewitness accounts on all kinds of news.

GPS devices on smart phones provide even more sophisticated utility. Traffic maps are already common; Traffic.com, Yahoo Traffic, and Google maps provide traffic maps online, and there are many smart phone apps that make the local traffic cameras available to get a glimpse at your favorite intersection before you commit to your usual route. But side streets and alternate routes are not tracked by these methods. If a commuting community cellphone application existed that allowed users to report blockages on streets off the main thor-oughfares, drivers might be able to learn about accidents and tie-ups that are out of sight of the cameras and get more fine-grained information not available through GPS (e.g., when not to use HOV lanes, which sometimes get more blocked than the regular freeways). Checking your phone as you turn on your engine to decide your route? Many peopl already do.

So called  X  X o-so X  social media or location-savvy social media is currently one of the hottest new innovations, and the AiA map is arguably one of them. As a community map, it provides a resource for a community (a city, a university, a small region) to post items of local interest. Like a newspaper [Anderson 1991], it reflects the identity, wants, desires, and interests of a fairly small place (even if that small place is, say, Tokyo). In AiA, the filters have been changing to match the changing interests and needs of the non-government organizations that presumably post to it; recently the map added a filter for ISAF news, that is, information from the foreign military coalition, creating an amazingly inclusive community of users.
 For the public to effectively use such a resource, they need to use it regularly.
Part of the reason that Twitter became an ad-hoc crisis platform was because of its familiarity. It was a go-to resource for fast information, shared with a community whose members were  X  X electively transparent X  [Qualman 2009].
This selective transparency meant that some things were known about the members: how often they posted, a little background information, and the content of all their posts. Regular contact promoted a degree of social trust, and selective transparency (individuals in control of what they revealed about themselves) made people more willing to contribute to the information flow.
Social media is like the newspapers of yesterday [Anderson 1991], a reflection of who a community is. But in this case, the community is far more diverse and distributed than sociologists and anthropologists have ever expected.
A good community map would be timely, no more than a day or a week X  X  worth of postings would appear on the front page to improve readability. Postings could be anonymous (like on AiA) or people could get handles, as in chat rooms, and so begin to establish reputations that lead to status and trust. Links to their
Facebook identity, Web site, or blog might even be permissible, encouraging the development of smaller subcommunities such as those interested in sports, even particular teams, or wine-tasting, or events for new parents. But there should be an underlying vision of who the community is that you want to serve (say, a university) and there must be someone in charge. As Jeff Howe [2008] puts it, a benevolent dictator is key to a successful crowdsourced information resource.

In making the flip to crisis mode (from community map to crisis map) there will most likely need to be some levels of the term crisis. Many of the microscale problems of community do not warrant a call to 911. In a football game traf-fic jam, people want to know: Is parking full at the south lot? Where can I find parking? A university crisis map might be initiated for game day. The po-lice, fire/ rescue, and campus security might all contribute X  X nd consult X  X he map to improve information flow. A normal university community map that shows information for class changes, club meetings, and special events on cam-pus could flip to crisis mode during a shooter-on-campus incident, providing information and advice from campus security, the police, and university crisis management staff. This could augment current  X  X last texting X  schemes in place at many universities to alert students to on-campus crises using sms messaging to mobile phones.

Once people become used to using a community map for normal events and information, the flip to crisis mode becomes a natural extension of how they get community information. Rules and social norms, together with social behavior, will develop naturally with time and experience.

In the excellent book, Crowdsourcing , Jeff Howe [2008] elucidates some of the critical rules for crowdsourcing, rules that are exactly in step with the needs of crisis mapping. There must be someone in charge (even if it is a committee) to make critical decisions often about what not to do (or create) , rather than what to do (or create). In creating social media, this is probably one of the more important rules, then development of a benevolent dictator who understands the socio-technical behavior of the social media-using public.

The term socio-technical behavior is introduced here to describe new patterns of behavior mediated by and promoted through advanced commu-nications (smart phones), software, and server technologies. Rather than pur-chasing newspapers, the new socio-technical behavior pattern is to have news portals like Digg or Huffington Post offer up the most popular headlines drawn from across the country or the world . Socio-technical behavior is behavior that has changed from long-held patterns to take advantage of the new information flows offered by new technology. Napster changed how people thought about music acquisition and made possible the development of Itunes; people already saw music as  X  X n MP3 X  not necessarily a CD, and hunted for songs one at a time, rather than album by album. Socio-technical behavior involves the use of new information resources and advanced communications technology (such as smart phones) to make different decisions, collaborate in new ways with a mixture of trusted and less trusted people, and make their own informa-tion selectively transparent to the larger socio-technical world, which has the dividend of encouraging trust in oneself.

Community maps will provide for new experiments in social behavior. Un-like its AiA ancestor, the next generation of community/crisis maps will reflect a community that runs at a fast pace and has a high information demand.
Many of the posts will be, or should be, short lived. For example, traffic jams have a short shelflife, no more than a few hours, so the report needs to fade automatically back to a history layer. A house-party invitation needs to go out soon enough before the party and fade immediately after it is over and have a limited distribution list, while reports of a sale might go on for a few days. Real estate on the virtual map could get crowded if the site is popular. A sense of who the map is primarily for will need to be well articulated. The benevolent dictator will have his/her/their hands full deciding what behavior to encour-age and what services to provide and what to specifically not provide [Howe 2008].

And what about spoofing (false reports) of parties that aren X  X  there, for ex-ample? Past experience with social media suggest that bad data can be rapidly culled out of the system by other reports (usual multiple reports) that the data is wrong, but this is still a social as well as a computer science experiment.
At this writing, people texting in will leave their fingerprints (their phone number), which will help prevent inaccurate or bogus reports. If they block their identity, then that, too, is a red flag about its trustworthiness. The new  X  X o-so X  applications (location-social) are in essence a kind of socio-technical be-havior experiment which will provide many insights into the issue of spoofing and how people handle the opportunities afforded them by new socio-technical innovations.

This community map should be developed as an analogue for the develop-ment of crisis maps and in conjunction with notions of how to gracefully morph the map in mini-crisis situations as well as rules for when to flip the map into full crisis mode. 6. THE CRISIS MAP/FIRST RESPONDER CONCEPT
This third form of crisis map, the multilayer interagency crisis map, (Figure 1) can be created with a flip of the public map to crisis mode, with separate layers for agencies responding to the crisis (even non-government agencies and other host nations, in international crises). Ushahidi-style maps for internal use, say an Ushahidi map just for police, fire/rescue and other first-responders to trade real-time information, could leverage public messages by having the public crisis map information available as a separate layer on the (more secured) internal map so that police and fire and rescue on the ground can have a full view of a crisis and send up information feeds on-the-fly that stay there, instead of disappearing into the radio-feed. The officer who comes on an hour after the crisis has started can look at his I-Phone or Android or other smart-phone capable of seeing the map on the Internet and get a view of what has happened in the last hour without having to have a long drawn-out briefing. Since the
Ushahidi platform can incorporate photos and video, the officer X  X  information feed can be rich and fast.

The new collaborational map would enable trusted collaborators to push information up from their own resources and maps to an interagency layer (Figure 2). Behind-the-scenes efforts that individual agencies do not want seen by other agencies can be kept on their own internal map with additional tools for tracking personnel, tracking tasks and task completion, tracking trans-portation and other resources. The various agencies could even post general requests to the map, provide information on situations that might warrant as-sistance from another agency in the near term, etc. This selective transparency would allow users the control they need of their own information while getting the benefit of information flows from outside the agency itself.

Will the benefits of fresh data and more data be sufficient to overcome first responder agencies X  security concerns? The abuse of the information must also be considered, this is, after all, a form of  X  X rowdsourcing X  crisis information and a crisis, by definition, engenders confusion and noise. That X  X  what makes the community map experiment so compelling. More research on the socio-technical behaviors of lo-so applications community maps will help us to understand how social behavior will be shaped by (and will shape) this new form of social media.

There are a number of good experiments in crowdsourcing that can be a guide for work in this area. Jeff Howe [2008] presents the 1:10:89 Rule: one percent of the crowd will create content, ten percent will validate (or vote) on content, and the rest will simply consume (in most crowdsourcing models.)
Alive in Afghanistan has voting buttons that enable users to vote whether or not they thought a post was true or not. This functionality is not to be dismissed; crowd-sourced sites rely on validators to police the quality of crowd-sourced posts.

Cultural issues will surely permeate the development of community maps/crisis maps. Islamabad and Bangkok will have different attitudes to-wards official authority such as the police, and their willingness to trust them in a crisis using this medium will have to be worked out over time. International crises will be particularly challenging as non-profit organizations are often in direct competition with one another for donor dollars and for credit for their accomplishments. Realizing this three-layered map will be in itself a study of the evolution of socio-technical behaviors as agencies and organizations be-gin to use or adopt new strategies for working together and working with the public.

The community map will have to reflect the social mores of the society as it is, not the society as the authorities might want it to be. Social protests will test and try the capability of crisis maps to promote clean government, clean elections, and other social values considered desirable by the public and the countervailing hand of powerful entities determined to bend a crisis point (like an election) to their will. Could such a map be used to coordinate protests?
Of course. Could it be used to stanch protest? That X  X  certainly possible. Then again, Twitter and Facebook are banned in certain authoritarian countries like China. 8 The Iranian Government is permanently suspending access to
Google X  X  Gmail, 9 because it is just too hard to predict the outcome of the public will, bolstered by powerful new technologies that link people across time and space.

In the short run, the results of the experiments like AiA are helping the international community begin to experiment with social media and human-itarian operations. New rules and new laws will doubtless catch up in time.
Okulloh X  X  vision of  X  X estimony X  against corruption and despair are beginning to be realized. The need for social science research in this area is very clear. Multi-disciplinary research in sociology, anthropology, and computer science are just beginning to take notice of the connection between social media and society. These are developments to watch.
