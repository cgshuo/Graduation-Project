 1. Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory dis-ease of the Central Nervous System, which causes the damage or destruction of myelin surrounding nerve fibers. In more detail, such a disease is characterized by multiple demyelinated lesions involving the brain and spinal cord, that interrupt communica-tions between the nerves and the rest of the body ( Compston and Coles, 2008 ).

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, about 250.000 X 350.000 people in the United States have been diagnosed with MS. Worldwide, the incidence of MS is approximately 0.1%. Northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia and New Zealand have the highest prevalence, with more than 30 cases per 100.000 people.

MS has an unpredictable clinical course and it is more common in women and in Caucasians. The average age of onset is between 20 and 40, but the disorder may develop at any age ( Rosati, 2001 ). It produces neurological dysfunctions, such as numbness, impaired vision, loss of balance, weakness, bladder dysfunction and psychological changes. Many MS cases evolve over a long period (20 X 30 years) with remissions and exacerba-tions, but, in almost half of all cases, it relentlessly progresses to severe disability and premature death ( Kidd, 2001 ).
Diagnosis of MS is based on the principle of dissemination in both time and space. Recent criteria state that patients should experience two attacks of such dysfu nctions, occurring at different points of time and affecting different parts of the Central Nervous
System. Many years may elapse between the first attack and the second one, and not all the patients who experience a first attack develop MS. Nevertheless, such attacks are extremely variable, often quite subtle; hence, they can lead to a suspicion of disease, but, in many cases, they cannot be sufficient on their own for the diagnosis.
In such a sense, recently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been applied as a supporting t ool in MS diagnosis, enabling the visualization of cerebral MS lesions, both in clinically suspected cases and in silent ones ( Miller et al., 2004 ).

Furthermore, the lack of laboratory markers for MS activity, progression and remission has brought much interest to the application of MRI, especially as a monitoring tool both in the course of MS and in the assessment of treatment effects ( Miller, 1994; Miller et al., 1998; Filippi et al., 1995 ). As a matter of fact, brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images allow to characterize MS lesions in both space and time, i.e. providing information about their number, size and spatial distribution for every single study and, moreover, highlighting changes among studies performed at different times. The use of MR images as MS marker requires the expert X  X  knowledge and intervention to classify MS lesions; nevertheless, manual classification is a very thorny and time-consuming task due to the huge amount of MR images to be examined and the variable number, size and spatial distribution of MS lesions per image.

Operator-assisted techniques, such as local thresholding, have been successfully employed ( Filippi et al., 1996 ), but they are time-consuming and require operator intervention since they are monoparametric, i.e. based only on MR signal intensity data. As a consequence, they are strongly associated with some degree of variability due to the operator intervention and, in this respect, the use of an automated system for supporting neuroradiologists to detect MS lesions could be undoubtedly advantageous. Suc-cessful methods assessing multiple parameters have been devel-oped in the last decade, in which automated classification of MS lesions is characterized by high specificity and sensitivity ( Alfano et al., 2000; Akselrod-Ballin et al., 2009; Anbeek et al., 2004;
Freifeld et al., 2009; Khayati et al., 2008; Sajja et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2002; Wels et al., 2008; Zijdenbos et al., 2002 ).
Although all these methods have a high classification accuracy, they suffer from two important limitations. First, most part of them does not reproduce the real decision-making process performed by neuroradiologists, but implements advanced algo-rithms that are often too complex to be understood by a non-technical audience such as the physicians. Indeed, their goal is to maximize the classification accuracy without providing compre-hensible outcomes to physicians, in terms of a clear and semantic description of the generated results. As a result, they are con-sidered by physicians as black boxes that simply generate answers with no further explanation. Differently, neuroradiolo-gists would like to have some insight as to how a classification method works and derives its outputs.

Second, lot of the methods existing in literature rely on mathematical models based on thresholding to classify MS lesions. Hence, they neither take into account the fuzziness of input data nor reproduce the expert decision-making process applied in a vague-laden domain such as medicine. As a matter of fact, the decision-making model every trustworthy physician has in mind to perform heuristic diagnosis is often pervaded by uncertainty and vagueness. Expert knowledge therefore abounds with imprecise formulations that are not a consequence of rhetorical inability, but an intrinsic part of expert knowledge acquired through laborious experience ( Steimann and Adlassnig, 2000 ). Any formalism disallowing uncertainty, such as crisp mathematical models, is therefore inapt to capture this knowl-edge ( Adlassnig, 1998; Steimann and Adlassnig, 2000 ) and can represent an unrealistic oversimplification of reality, leading to possible wrong interpretations when compared to a direct observation.

Therefore, a system able to detect MS lesions by handling fuzziness and providing interpretation for the classification out-puts would be of great clinical value.

In such a sense, an ontology-based fuzzy decision support system (DSS) has been developed in order to automatically support neuroradiologists in the classification of a type of MS lesion, i.e. white matter lesion (WML). Such a DSS encodes high-level medical knowledge elicited from experts in terms of ontologies and fuzzy rules and applies such a knowledge in conjunction with a fuzzy inference engine to classify WMLs and to obtain a measure of their volumes. Specifically, ontologies are used to represent the semantic structure of the expert X  X  knowledge and to provide a comprehensible formulation of the generated outcomes. Fuzzy logic is used to handle fuzziness of input dataset and reproduce the expert X  X  decision-making process to classify WMLs with further capability of attributing a confidence measure to the output results. The performance of the DSS is quantitatively evaluated on 120 patients affected by MS. Moreover, a statistical analysis is carried out to appraise to the extent the DSS has an influence on the diagnostic tasks of physicians, and whether this influence can be quantified. 2. Background
The proposed DSS relies on a knowledge-based approach integrating two knowledge-representation techniques, namely ontologies and fuzzy logic, shortly outlined in the following sub-sections. 2.1. Ontology
The philosophical concept of ontology, as  X  X  X he branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of being X  X  has been used in many areas of science and literature. This concept, also co-opted by computer specialists, means a vocabulary and a set of terms and relations that define, with the needed accuracy, a set of entities enabling the definition of classes, hierarchies, and other relations among them ( Gruber, 1995; Guarino, 1995 ).
The ontology modeling defines the terms to describe and represent a knowledge domain. As such, an ontology of a domain is a form of computer-acceptable representation of knowledge about a part of an abstract or real world. In general, an ontology model O can be presented in the form of a set C of concepts and a finite family of ontological models M k , k  X  1, 2, y , K , defined as relationships described on selected subsets of C . The relationships may be of various kinds, e.g. binary relationships, named roles. However, taxonomies T i , i  X  1, 2, y , I of the concepts are manda-tory elements of the ontology.
 The current standard language to formalize ontologies is Web Ontology Language (OWL), a Semantic Web tool based on Description Logics to represent knowledge and support a wide range of reasoning facilities ( Patel-Schneider et al., 2004 ). Description Logics (DLs) ( Baader et al., 2003 ) are a family of concept-based knowledge representation formalisms, equipped with well defined model-theoretic semantics ( Tarski, 1956 ). They are characterized by the use of various constructors to build complex concept descriptions from simpler ones and by the provision of sound, complete and empirically tractable reasoning services, e.g. to ensure logical consistency or infer new knowledge ( Horrocks et al., 2000 ).

Both the well-defined semantics and the powerful reasoning tools that exist for DLs make ontologies ideal to encode knowl-edge in a plethora of applications. Nevertheless, although ontol-ogy languages and, more in general, Description Logics provide considerable expressive power, they feature limitations regarding the ability to represent vague knowledge ( Lukasiewicz and Straccia, 2008; Stoilos et al., 2007 ), i.e. knowledge characterized by boundaries that are not clear-cut between concepts. As a result, in this work a hybrid approach combining ontology and fuzzy logic formalisms together is proposed with the final aim of providing both the abilities of describing semantically a domain of interest and reasoning with uncertainty and/or vagueness. 2.2. Fuzzy logic
Fuzzy logic resembles human reasoning in its use of vague information to generate decisions ( Zadeh, 1965 ). Unlike classical logic, which requires a deep understanding of a system, exact equations and precise numeric values, fuzzy logic incorporates an alternative way of thinking that allows modeling complex sys-tems using a higher level of abstraction originating from knowl-edge and experience ( Siagian, 2003 ).

A fuzzy variable (also named linguistic variable) is character-ized by its name tag, a set F of fuzzy values (also known as linguistic values) and the membership functions m F of these values; fuzzy values assign a membership value to elements u within some predefined range U (known as the universe of discourse) in the following way: F  X f X  u , m F  X  9 u A F and m F : U - X  0 , 1 g
The goal of fuzzy variables is to facilitate a gradual transition between states, so as to have, unlike crisp variables, a natural capacity to express vagueness in measurements.

Fuzzy logic provides an inference morphology enabling the approximate human reasoning capabilities of drawing conclu-sions from existing data: specifically, it is possible to infer new truths from old. In more detail, the fuzzy inference morphology relies on fuzzy rules, defined as conditional statements written in the following form:  X  X  X f antecedent then consequent  X  X  where antecedent is a fuzzy-logic expression composed of one or more simple fuzzy expressions connected by fuzzy operators, and consequent is an expression that assigns fuzzy values to the output variables.

A fuzzy reasoning evolves through four steps, namely fuzzifi-cation of input variables, rule evaluation, aggregation of rule outputs and, finally, defuzzification.

Fuzzification of input variables translates crisp (real-valued) inputs into fuzzy values. Rule evaluation applies the fuzzified inputs to the antecedents of fuzzy rules. If a given fuzzy rule has multiple antecedents, a fuzzy operator is used to obtain a single number that represents the degree of activation of the rule. The latter is used to determine the conclusion of the rule: this operation is called the implication. There are several implication operators, but the most common is the  X  X  X inimum X  X , also defined as clipping. This operator cuts off the values of membership function of the rule consequent, which are higher than the degree of activation of the rule. Aggregation is the process that unifies the rule outputs: the membership functions of all rule conse-quents previously clipped are combined into a single fuzzy set.
Finally, defuzzification is the process that generates a single crisp value starting from the aggregated output fuzzy set.

In fuzzy modeling, parameters are usually predefined by the designer based on experience and problem characteristics; num-ber of rules, antecedents and consequents of rules, linguistic variables and membership functions may be constructed using knowledge from a human expert.

Typical choices for the reasoning mechanism are Mamdani-type and Sugeno-type ( Yager and Filev, 1994 ). Common fuzzy operators are min, max, product, probabilistic and bounded sum.
The most common membership functions are triangular and trapezoidal. For the defuzzification, several methods have been proposed, with the center of area and the weighted average methods being the most popular, respectively, for Mamdani-type and Sugeno-type fuzzy inference systems ( Yager and Filev, 1994 ). 3. Materials 3.1. Data description
The dataset used in this study includes 120 patients with clinically definite MS. Their age range is between 20 and 63 years.
The clinical data for this study were collected, in an anonymized form, in the Department of Bio-Morphological and Functional Sciences of the University of Naples  X  X  X ederico II X  X .
MR brain images were acquired on a 1.5 T Philips Achieva scanner. All patients had the same MR protocol consisting in two spin-echo sequences with the following parameters: (1) spin echo sequence: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE)  X  640/30 ms; (2) dual echo sequence: TR/TE  X  2200/30 ms, TR/TE  X  2200/ 90 ms. All scans were performed with a 5 mm thickness, 15 mm slice gap, 32 not interleaved slices, covering the entire brain, a 230 mm 230 mm field of view and a 256 256 image matrix. 3.2. Image segmentation
Signal intensity of normal and abnormal tissues in MR images is affected by multiple physical parameters, the most important being the longitudinal ( T 1 ) and transverse ( T 2 ) relaxation times and the proton density (PD). In a conventional brain MRI study, a comparative evaluation of different sets of images, including T and PD-weighted images, is generally required.

In this study, the post-processing technique, named Quantita-tive Magnetic Color Imaging (QMCI), proposed in Alfano et al. (1995) has been applied. Such a technique combines into a single color-coded multispectral standardized image the information obtained with conventional spin-echo sequences (i.e. R 1 (1/ T and R 2 (1/ T 2 ) relaxation rates and PD). Starting from generated
QMCI images, the multiparametric segmentation procedure pro-posed in Alfano et al. (2000) is applied to the whole dataset in order to identify either normal brain tissues, namely gray matter, white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid, or clusters of poten-tially abnormal white matter voxels (i.e. a volumetric pixel representing a value on a regular grid in three dimensional space), labeled as White Matter Potential Lesions (WMPLs).

For each WMPL, the set of features enumerated in Table 1 is calculated. They can be divided in two groups: features computed directly from the candidate lesion; contextual features extracted from the lesion X  X  surrounding. 3.2.1. Features computed from WMPL
This group includes size and shape features. Size features are the following: (i) x , y and z dimensions of the bounding box ( B ) enclosing the lesion, given in terms of number of pixels; (ii) x , y and z voxel spacing, that means the spacing between adjacent voxels in the x , y and z directions, expressed in millimeters; (iii) the lesion volume, given in terms of the number of voxels ( N ) and calculated in centimeters as follows: V  X 
It is worth noting that 3D MR images used in this study are characterized by different values for x , y and z voxel spacing. In particular, voxel spacing values in x and y directions are about 0.08984 cm and in z direction is 0.5 cm.

Shape features are sphericity and compactness. Sphericity evaluates how spherical a lesion is. The more elongated the lesion is and deviates from a sphere, the lower sphericity will be. The measure of discrete sphericity for a 3D object ( Sph3D ) applied in this study resembles the one proposed in ( Brown et al., 2003 ).
Essentially, it is defined as the ratio between the volume V of the lesion and the volume of the smallest sphere enclosing the bounding box B of the lesion, as reported
Sph 3D  X  3 V 4 p r 3  X  2  X  r  X  0 : 5 max  X  x  X  y 2 y 1  X  y _ voxel _ spacing ,  X  z 2 z 1  X  z _ voxel _ spacing g sions, expressed in terms of spatial coordinates.

On the other hand, compactness evaluates how compact a lesion is. The measure of discrete compactness for a 3D object ( Comp3D ) relates the enclosing surface area, composed of the neighboring voxels of the object, with its volume. The area of the enclosing surface and the volume are both measured using the same unit, i.e. the voxel. For a given shape, Comp3D is high either in the case where the volume is large or in the case where the enclosing surface is small, which means the object is strongly compact.
 Summarizing, compactness is calculated as follows:
Comp 3D  X  N N where N b is the number of voxels neighboring the lesion. 3.2.2. Contextual features
This group includes two intensity level features, namely tissue contrast and surrounding WM. Tissue contrast evaluates the minimum color contrast to detect a WML in QMCI images. In the present work, the measure of tissue contrast is defined as a distance factor ( DFp ) that appraises the distance in the multi-parametric space necessary to detect a WML. It is represented by a percentage value. On the other hand, surrounding WM evalu-ates the amount of WM enclosing a lesion. The measure of surrounding WM ( SWMp ) is calculated in the study as a ratio between the surrounding WM and the number of voxels N b neighboring the lesion and it is expressed as a percentage value.
For the total 120 patients, a set of 2844 WMPLs has been detected by the segmentation procedure. The features just described, calculated for each WMPL of this set, represent the actual input data for the proposed DSS. 4. Method
The methodology proposed in the work relies on the construc-tion of a knowledge-based DSS responsible of (i) encoding the high-level, specialized medical knowledge elicited from clinical experts; (ii) making inferences through the application of this knowledge to the features described in Section 3.2; (iii) drawing conclusions with the final aim of supporting the clinicians X  everyday practice.

Essentially, the methodology can be described in terms of three stages, namely Knowledge Elicitation, Knowledge Repre-sentation and Knowledge Reasoning. They are, respectively, in charge of eliciting the knowledge from the experts, representing such an expertise by means of knowledge modeling techniques and, finally, constructing the reasoning engine to process the formalized know-how. These three stages are diffusely described later. 4.1. Knowledge Elicitation
The aim of Knowledge Elicitation is to obtain a body of knowledge that is as complete, consistent and correct as possible ( Fox et al., 1985 ). Most common methods of Knowledge Elicita-tion involve drawing out information from human experts and range from informal or semi-structured interviews and observa-tions to more structured methods like the transcription and analyses of verbal reports or conceptual techniques such as laddering, hierarchical sorting, graph construction, etc. ( Cooke, 1994 ). Some of these elicitation techniques can be conducted through the interaction between human experts and purposely built computer tools ( Khan and Hoffmann, 2003 ).

In the medicine context, the application of these techniques is aimed at making the implicit body of medical knowledge, known as tacit knowledge, more explicit and, contextually, at motivating physicians to provide an explanation to their actions. Generally speaking, tacit knowledge refers to the unarticulated knowledge that physicians apply in daily tasks, but are not able to describe easily in words.

The main goal of Knowledge Elicitation procedure applied in this work has been to gain an understanding of the terminology and the reasoning path applied by neuroradiologists when mak-ing decisions about WM lesions.

An exploratory approach has been followed at this stage and think-aloud protocols have been analyzed. In more detail, a team of five neuroradiologists employed at the Department of Bio-Morphological and Functional Sciences of the University of Naples  X  X  X ederico II X  X  has taken part by interpreting WM lesions from 10 symptomatic patients: 5 with reported WMPLs but no actual WM lesion and 5 with reported WMPLs that included many actual WM lesions.

The Knowledge Elicitation procedure has been conducted individually with each radiologist at his/her own workplace. The participants were presented with the 10 sets of MR studies, one set at a time and shown by means of a conventional medical image viewer. All radiologists saw the same MR studies, though in different sequences. The participants were asked to read each MR study as they would in a normal clinical situation and to  X  X  X hink aloud X  X , reporting everything that went through their mind. Since the method of representing medical knowledge in terms of rules appears more appropriate and generally accepted ( Kong et al., 2008; Straszecka, 2004 ), because it is easily usable and under-standable also by a non-technical audience, e.g. the clinicians, we have instructed the participants to analyze all the features out-lined in Section 3.2 on the MR images, and to formalize a tentative diagnosis in terms of the heuristic rules. As a result, the physi-cians have formulated rules at a higher level of abstraction, expressing their knowledge in form of qualitative linguistic labels associated to the features defined in Section 3.2.

These verbal reports were then recorded on audio-tape. The resulting audio-recorded think-aloud reports were transcribed and an overall textual report containing all the different con-tributions provided by the participating radiologists was finally generated.

After that, subsequent analyses have been carried out with the final aim of identifying the linguistic labels used by the radiolo-gists to describe the reported WM lesions starting from the features defined in Section 3.2. As indicated by the participating radiologists, the most commonly used linguistic labels for each feature and for the expected diagnostic outcome are summarized in Table 2 . The table includes those linguistic labels noted by three or more participants.

After that, successive analyses have been performed to identify the reasoning path followed by the radiologists to provide a tentative diagnosis for the reported WMPLs starting from the linguistic labels shown in Table 2 . The outcome of these analyses is synthesized, in natural language, as follows.

The tissue composing a WMPL is abnormal in the case where the lesion is somewhat surrounded by WM, characterized by a strong compactness and greatly contrasted in the multipara-metric space (that is, it borders with different kinds of cerebral tissue). The sphericity is moderate or high in small lesions; whereas as their volume increases, the sphericity starts decreas-ing progressively.

Finally, a correlation was identified between the volume, shape features and the percentage of surrounding white matter of a WMPL: as volume increases and sphericity starts lessening, a lesion can be surrounded by gradually decreasing WM and its compactness still remains high.

The reasoning path just described includes only the heuristic rules formulated by three or more participants. The linguistic labels indicated in Table 2 and such a reasoning path represents the outcomes produced by the Knowledge Elicitation procedure. 4.2. Knowledge Representation
The elicited knowledge implicit ly includes both the structure of the domain knowledge, named descriptive knowledge ,andthepro-cessing that takes place throughout the whole course of the decision making activity, named procedural knowledge . In particular, descrip-tive knowledge concerns the doma in compositional elements, such as raw and abstract concepts, their properties and inter-relations. On the other hand, procedural knowledge captures the behavioral logic and provides more explicit informat ion about the actions to be taken or conclusions to be drawn from descriptive knowledge.
In this work, techniques of ontology modeling have been utilized to represent descriptive knowledg e, whereas procedural knowledge has been modeled by means of fu zzy logic techniques, as synthe-sized in Fig. 1 and described in detail in the next sub-sections. 4.2.1. Ontology modeling
In such a scenario, descriptive knowledge includes both the terminological structure identified in Table 2 and the numeric measures associated to the features defined in Section 3.2.
In detail, a middle-out approach has been employed to identify the basic terms composing the domain structure. This strategy enables to identify the most fundamental terms in the domain of interest before moving on to more abstract and more specific terms. In such a way, it strikes a balance in terms of the level detail. Indeed, detail arises only as necessary, by specializing the basic terms, so some effort is avoided and the higher level terms are more likely to be stable. This, in turn, leads to less re-work and less overall effort ( Uschold and Gr  X  uninger, 1996 ).
Next, the properties of the terms, i.e. attributes, and the relationships between these terms have been specified. The result so far has been a summary containing all terms, relationships and attributes to be used afterwards to build the ontology described below, in accordance with the following design criteria:
Definition of primitive and defined elements. A primitive element has been considered the essential factor to the representation of the specialty in the ontology, since it cannot be expressed in terms of other elements. On the other hand, a defined element has been built by means of a closed-form description. By basing the ontology on primitive elements, it has been possible to remove the circularity found in other types of information sources, such as dictionaries, where terms can be defined with respect to other ones. All other definitions of elements within the ontology can be traced back to the primitive ones.
Clear distinction between concepts and individuals. Terms pre-liminarily identified have been modeled in the ontology as concepts or individuals, each of them having been assigned a specified role: individuals have been considered as primitive elements, whereas concepts have been built as defined ele-ments. In particular, defined concepts can be specified as:
Restricted usage of the possible types of relationship. The only kind of relationship adopted in the ontology is the role, i.e. a binary relationship between concepts; whereas n -ary relation-ships, with n greater than two, have not been used. Moreover, the is X  X  relationship has not been utilized and, as a result, no form of inheritance has been considered. Both these choices have been carried out since the aim of this ontology is to provide only a very simple and intuitive definitional descrip-tion of terms to be used in the rules for assembling their antecedent and consequent parts. In such a sense, the use of a minimal ontology with a limited expressiveness, very similar to a dictionary of terms, can simplify undoubtedly the writing of rules and, more in general, their final structure and make them easy to be written and understood by a non-technical audience, e.g. physicians.

Unambiguous and consistent usage of attributes and relation-ships. Attributes and relationships between concepts have been characterized by a well-specified semantics through properties and restrictions. In particular, relationships have been defined in terms of domain, i.e. the admissible subject concept, and range, i.e. the admissible object concept. Attri-butes have been similarly characterized by a domain and a range, but, in this case, the range identifies a value type rather than a set of possible object concepts.

Specification of a user-defined vocabulary. The ontology is essentially  X  X  X n application ontology X  X  ( Guarino, 1997 ), describ-ing concepts dependent on a particular domain and task; in particular, the domain chosen is the neuroradiology applied to multiple sclerosis, and the task is the identification of WMLs by means of MR brain images previously segmented. For this reason, the vocabulary for this ontology has been constructed as a collection of terms strictly related to the specific applica-tion, drawn up in cooperation with the team of neuroradiol-ogists involved in the study.

The ontology is organized as follows. The expert knowledge, expressed in form of qualitative linguistic labels just reported in Table 2 , is formalized by means of concepts and individuals. In detail, the features volume , sphericity , surrounding white matter , compactness and tissue contrast are modeled in terms of concepts with one-to one mapping, whereas the nature of the tissue composing a WMPL, which represents the expected diagnostic outcome, is modeled with the concept tissue structure . They are formalized as defined concepts built in form of collections of individuals, each of them representing a possible linguistic label identified in Table 2 by the experts.

The core concept of the ontology, named potential lesion , represents a possible lesion identified in the white matter; it can be associated to the other concepts through the roles listed in
Table 3 . Moreover, it is formalized as a defined concept built by applying a collection of restrictions on such roles.

Finally, a set of attributes have been defined as listed in Table 4 so as to associate the numerical values calculated for the features reported in Section 3.2 to the concept potential lesion. In addition, the attribute Confidence Degree has been also defined to associate a confidence measure to a WMPL indicating the likelihood that it corresponds to an actual lesion. The notion of confidence will be soundly explained in the Section 4.3. 4.2.2. Fuzzy modeling
The procedural knowledge relying on this descriptive structure can be extracted from the reasoning path reported in Section 4.1 and built in terms of if-then rules on the top of concepts and properties defined in the ontology. In detail, three  X  X  X f-then rules X  X  to identify the cases when a potential lesion is an actual one have been formulated as outlined in Fig. 2 .

In addition, an  X  X  X lse rule X  X  has been added to determine, in all the remaining situations, all the potential abnormal cases that are not actual lesions. Since the neuroradiologists X  expertise has been formulated at a high level of abstraction without specifying clear-cut boundaries between concepts, the reported rules have been formalized in accordance with the fuzzy theory. In particular, the definition of linguistic variables, linguistic values and member-ship functions has been carried out according to the following set of criteria, with the final aim of granting the interpretability:
Semantics : linguistic variables and their possible values have a semantic meaning well defined by the ontology. Fundamen-tally, each linguistic variable is one of the ontology concepts defined and its possible linguistic values are the admissible individuals for the corresponding concept.

Distinguishability : the universe of discourse for each linguistic variable is determined depending on the range of possible values in the input dataset that the corresponding features described in Section 3.2 can assume. Since all linguistic values have a semantic meaning, the corresponding fuzzy sets are distinguishable, i.e. well disjoint with defined ranges in the same universe of discourse, so as to represent distinct concepts and can be associated to metaphorically different linguistic values ( Mencar et al., 2007 ). Therefore, this enables to clearly assign, starting from a numerical input, a possible value to a linguistic variable (i.e. an admissible individual to a concept).
Coverage : any element from the universe of discourse belongs to at least one of the fuzzy sets defined for the linguistic values.

Normalization : Since all linguistic values have a semantic meaning, for each of them, at least one element of the universe of discourse has a membership value equal to one.

Orthogonality : for each element of the universe of discourse, the sum of all its membership values is equal to one.
The linguistic variables, linguistic values and corresponding membership functions opportunely defined and iteratively tuned with the collaboration of the physicians have been reported in Fig. 3 .

In more detail, each linguistic variable is described in terms of a set of graph curves representing the membership functions of its linguistic values and by means of a table reporting a numerical description about the curve shapes. With regards to the input linguistic variables, each membership function associated to a linguistic value has a trapezoidal shape and is specified in a row of the corresponding table by an ordered set of four real values, where the first represents the starting value of the leading edge, the second its ending value, the third the starting value of the trailing edge and the fourth its final value. The membership function for the output variable tissue structure is defined by two singleton spikes, respectively, in 1 for the value normal and in 2 for the value abnormal . 4.3. Knowledge Reasoning
The Knowledge Reasoning is the process of combining the knowledge formalized in the ontology with the fuzzy logic inference morphology, so as to enable the approximate human reasoning capabilities of drawing conclusions from existing vague data. The architecture shown in Fig. 4 has been devised to execute this task and consists of a fuzzy inference engine and a knowledge base. 4.3.1. The fuzzy inference engine
The fuzzy engine implements a zero-order Sugeno-type fuzzy inference method that resembles the Fuzzy Inference Ruled by
Else-Action (FIRE) method proposed in Russo and Ramponi (1995) to filter images. In the following, the basic knowledge about the proposed method is described.

Definition 1. Given M fuzzy rules, N continuous input variables v , v , y , v N and one discrete output variable s , the formulation of the Sugeno-type fuzzy rules is defined as follows:
IF  X  v , A 11  X  AND = OR  X  v 2 , A 12  X  ...  X  v N , A 1 N  X  THEN  X  s , B
IF  X  v , A 21  X  AND = OR  X  v 2 , A 22  X  ...  X  v N , A 2 N  X  THEN  X  s , B
IF  X  v , A M 1  X  AND = OR  X  v 2 , A M 2  X  ...  X  v N , A MN  X  THEN  X  s , B
A  X  X  a ij  X  AND = OR  X  b ij  X  ... AND = OR  X  z ij  X  X  4  X  where A ij is a logical expression associated to each rule i and calculated for the variable j in accordance with its linguistic associated, respectively, to rule i and to the ELSE rule calculated for the output variable s . This formulation models a disjunctive system of rules where at least one rule must be satisfied, i.e. the rules are linked by OR connectives. The ELSE rule is activated when the other rules are weakly satisfied or not satisfied at all.
The introduction of the logical expression A ij in this formula-tion is motivated by the need of using different AND and OR operators depending on whether they connect fuzzy values of different linguistic variables or fuzzy values of the same linguistic variable. In fuzzy theory, AND and OR operators are often modeled as fuzzy-set intersection and union in the rules. This involves that, for instance, the disjunction of two contiguous and orthogonal fuzzy sets, modeled as the fuzzy-set union, can generate a scarcely intuitive behavior. Indeed, in the area in which the two fuzzy sets are partially overlapping, the uncer-tainty is the greatest between the corresponding values of the two fuzzy sets. Differently, in the common sense, the disjunction in the overlapping area should have an additive behavior, that means the values of uncertainty of both the fuzzy sets in that area should be summed.

As a result, we have chosen to model AND and OR operators as fuzzy-set intersection and union in the case when fuzzy values of different linguistic variables have to be logically connected and as proposed in the Lukasiewicz Logic ( Gilesa, 1975 ), in accordance with a common sense fashion, in the case when fuzzy values of the same linguistic variable have to be logically connected. The formal description of the operators used is reported in the following definition.

Definition 2. The strength level l of the rule i is calculated in terms of grade of membership for the antecedent clause. In particular, when the antecedents are connected by the AND operator the strength level is formulated as l  X  min f m Aij  X  v j  X  ; j  X  1 , 2 , ... , N g X  5  X  whereas, when the antecedents are connected by the OR operator, it is defined as l  X  max f m Aij  X  v j  X  ; j  X  1 , 2 , ... , N g X  6  X 
The logical expression A ij associated to each rule i is calculated for the variable j in terms of grade of membership for its linguistic values a ij , b ij , y , z ij in the antecedent clause. In particular, when the linguistic values of the variable in the antecedent clause are connected by the AND operator, the logical expression A ij calculated as
A  X  max 0 , whereas, when they are connected by the OR operator A ij it is calculated as
A  X  min 1 ,
Definition 3. The strength level l E of the ELSE rule is calculated by applying a NOT operator to the strength levels l i of the other rules, since the ELSE rule is activated when all the other ones are partially or completely unsatisfied. Moreover, since the IF-THEN rules are connected by OR connectives, the results obtained by applying the NOT operator to the strength levels l i are combined in a conjunctive system, i.e. by means of AND connectives. Summarizing, the strength level l E is defined as l  X  min f 1 l i  X  v j  X  ; i  X  1 , 2 , ... , M g X  9  X  Definition 4. The operations of implication and aggregation for all the M rules are conjunctly calculated as a weighted average of the strength levels using the numerical values associated to the singleton spikes defined in the output universe. In detail, the weighted average is formulated as WA  X  s  X  X  Definition 5. The result of the weighted average is a continuous appraisal value of the classification produced by the whole inference process. The final discrete output is produced by simply identifying the singleton spike whose numerical value is nearest to the appraisal value with respect to a fixed threshold value.
Moreover, a confidence measure is calculated as a function of the distance existing between the appraisal value and the numer-ical value of the final discrete output. This measure represents the system X  X  trustworthiness in its outcomes expressed on an ordinal scale; specifically, the larger the distance is evaluated, the less the system is confident in the generated results.

Summarizing, the final discrete output and the linked con-fidence are defined as if  X  9 WA  X  s  X  x B if  X  9 WA  X  s  X  x B where threshold is included between 0 and 1. 4.3.2. The knowledge base and the reasoning process
The knowledge base is made of the components described as follows:
T-Box: the terminological box contains the intentional part of the formalized knowledge, i.e. the ontology, the rules built in terms of concepts and roles and, for each concept equivalently formalized with a linguistic variable, the relative membership function.

A-Box : the assertional box contains the extensional part of the formalized knowledge, i.e. the individuals (instances of con-cepts) with the corresponding instances of roles and attributes.
It is dynamically populated starting from features extracted by the preliminary multiparametric segmentation procedure.
With these components in mind, the Knowledge Reasoning process can be delineated in the following manner. Input data extracted by the preliminary multiparametric segmentation pro-cedure mainly include all the WMPLs and their peculiar features. Starting from these input data, a corresponding number of individuals for the concept potential lesion is instanced. More-over, the numerical values calculated for the input features are also associated to the corresponding attributes of each individual.
All the individuals are successively stored in the A-Box as statements that will be used to match with the IF part of the rules stored in the T-Box of the knowledge base. In particular, the fuzzy inference engine will be responsible for linking the rules in the T-Box with the data in the A-Box and performing the decision-making process.
 In more detail, the engine compares the individuals in the A-Box with the membership functions in the rule antecedent clause, so as to obtain the membership values of each linguistic value. Then, it calculates the strength level of each rule in accordance with the method formalized in the definitions 1, 2 and 3. After that, the qualified rule consequences are calculated and aggregated to form a unified output by applying the proce-dure described in the definition 4. Finally, the discrete output and the associated measure of confidence are resolved as described in the definition 5.

The output produced by the Knowledge Reasoning process is a textual report containing the dichotomous (normal/abnormal) diagnosis, its confidence expressed on an ordinal scale and an explanation of it. This textual report is also linked back to the MR images where the actual WMLs are highlighted. The explanation of the diagnosis summarizes the reasoning path executed and the strength level calculated for each rule fired. Moreover, the crisp values of the input dataset and their fuzzified values are also indicated in order to enable physicians to evaluate the suggestion automatically generated by the DSS by also referring to the linked
MR images. All this information is expressed in terms of ontology concepts, roles and attributes with the final aim of providing a semantic description extremely simple and intuitive to be read and understood also by a non-technical audience. An example of output generated by the Knowledge Reasoning process is reported in the following: 5. Evaluation
Review papers ( Trivedi et al., 2002; Kaplan, 2001; Tierney, 2001; Johnston et al., 1994 ) point out that the vast majority of
DSSs presented in literature are evaluated in a somewhat artificial context, i.e. as stand-alone software systems designed to operate in parallel to, but not necessarily in support of the physician.
Moreover, they are predominantly evaluated depending on their diagnostic performance, in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, or complete ROC curves, but a wide array of issues raised by the use of these systems in a real clinical environment is sidestepped. These issues pertain mainly to the role of the system in relation to the physician and, in particular, regard to the extent DSSs have an influence on the diagnostic activities of physicians, and whether this influence can be quantified ( Berner et al., 1999; Hunt et al., 1998 ).
The literature that addresses these and similar issues is much smaller ( Haug et al., 2003; McCowan et al., 2001 ), but, it is absolutely relevant to assessing the role and potential benefits of DSSs in real clinical settings.

As a result, in order to face these issues, the evaluation of the proposed DSS has been performed first analyzing quantitative performance measures, namely ROC curve and similarity mea-sures, and then looking directly at the effect that the system has on physicians, i.e. finding out how the system can influence the diagnostic opinion of physicians, regardless of the diagnostic performance measured. 5.1. Performance analysis
In the absence of histological confirmation, the true WMLs are not known. Therefore, the expertise of the team of neuroradiol-ogists participating at this study and employed at the Department of Bio-Morphological and Functional Sciences of the University of
Naples  X  X  X ederico II X  X  has been utilized in order to establish the true lesions among the identified WMPLs. In particular, only 1905 out of 2844 detected WMPLs have been classified as proven lesions by the team of neuroradiologists. This result is considered as the gold standard in the study.

Moreover, according to the WML load, patients have been arbitrarily grouped into four categories: 1. All patients ( n  X  120). 2. Patients with small lesion load ( n  X  50). 3. Patients with moderate lesion load ( n  X  41). 4. Patients with large lesion load ( n  X  29).

The patients have been inserted into categories 2, 3, 4, respectively, if the total lesion volume in the whole brain was (i) less than 3 cm 3 , (ii) greater than or equal to 3 cm or equal to 10 cm 3 and (iii) greater than 10 cm 3 .

Binary classifications of WM lesions were produced by apply-ing different thresholds in order to obtain discrete outputs from the continuous appraisal values generated by the fuzzy engine. Classification results

These classifications were compared with the gold standard, where the number of correctly classified voxels, that is, the true positives ( TP ) and true negatives ( TN ), was counted as well as the number of false positives ( FP ) and false negatives ( FN ). The true positive rate ( TPR ), which is the sensitivity, and the false positive rate ( FPR ), which is 1-specificity, were calculated for the thresh-old, running from 0 to 1. They are defined by TPR  X  TP TP  X  FN  X  12  X  FPR  X  FP FP  X  TN  X  13  X 
The TPF was represented in an ROC curve as function of the FPR for all the patient categories listed above.

Furthermore, the binary classifications were evaluated by three different similarity measures proposed in ( Anbeek et al., 2004 ): the similarity index ( SI ), the overlap fraction ( OF ) and the extra fraction ( EF ).

The SI is a measure for the correctly classified lesion volume relative to the total volume of WML in both the gold standard (reference) and the DSS outcome. The OF measures the correctly classified lesion volume relative to the WML volume in the reference. The EF measures the volume that is falsely classified as lesion relative to the WML volume in the reference. These similarity measures are formally defined as follows: SI  X  2  X  Vol REF \ Vol DSS  X  Vol OF  X  Vol REF \ Vol DSS Vol EF  X 
In these definitions, Vol REF and Vol DSS denote the WML volumes estimated through the manual expert classification and the classifica-tion automatically carried out by t he DSS, respectively. The intersec-tion of Vol REF and Vol DSS represents the volume of the correctly classified voxels. The volume Vol REF \ Vol DSS corresponds to the false positives. In all these measures the spatial correspondence between the automatic and manual classification was considered.
If SI and OF are close to 1 and EF computation is close to 0, then the WML volume determined by the automatic classification of the DSS is similar to the manual outcome obtained by a physician. The similarity measures thus allow the evaluation of the binary classifications performed by the DSS in a quantitative and objec-tive way. The SI was represented in a graph as function of the threshold, running from 0 to 1, for all the patient categories. The similarity measures were calculated for all the patient categories.
Binary classifications of WM lesions have been performed on the whole dataset composed of 120 patients. In Figs. 5 X 7 , example images are shown of the classification results of patients with a small, moderate and large lesion load.

The images demonstrate that the choice of the threshold to obtain discrete outputs from the continuous appraisal values generated by the fuzzy engine has large influence on the binary classifications. A higher threshold increases the specificity of the result, but has a negative effect on the sensitivity. 5.1.1. ROC analysis
The ROC curves were calculated for the classifications of all the patient categories. Fig. 8 shows a detail of the ROC curves with thresholds running from 0 to 1. The areas under the curves have been calculated and are presented in Table 5 .
 The ROC curves show that the classifications performed by the
DSS with variable thresholds produce better results in terms of specificity for patients with a large lesion load rather than for patients with a moderate or small lesion load. Indeed, the ROC curve for patients with a large lesion load follows the left-hand border of the ROC space closer than the curves for the other patient categories. This means that, given a threshold, the number of false positive is lower in patients with a large lesion load. In particular, this ROC curve starts following the left-hand border and then the top border of the ROC space closer than the other ones. For values of specificity included between 0.2 and 0.7, it inverts this trend and starts following the top border of the ROC space farther than the other curves. Finally, the trend of all the curves is approximately overlying.

In accordance with these considerations about the curve trends, it is possible to note that better results in terms of sensitivity are instead generated for patients with a moderate lesion load. Indeed, the ROC curve for patients with a moderate lesion load follows the top border of the ROC space closer than the curves for the other patient categories. This means that, given a threshold, the number of false negative is lower in patients with a moderate lesion load.

Finally, also the areas under the ROC curves confirm that the classifications performed by the DSS produce more accurate Moderate Lesion Load results for patients with a large lesion load rather than for patients with a moderate or small lesion load. 5.1.2. Similarity measures
Fig. 9 presents the SI for the binary classifications of all the patient categories with the threshold running from 0 to 1. Similar to the ROC curves, the SI graph shows that the best performance is reached for patients with a large lesion load.

Fig. 9 also shows that the optimal threshold for the binary classification in all the patient categories is approximately 0.5. Table 5 shows the SI , OF and EF of the binary classifications with three different thresholds (the optimal threshold is included, too) for all the patient categories.

On one hand, the SI improves significantly and the EF becomes very small in the cases when the lesion load increases. On the other hand, the OF is not characterized by notable differences in patients with a large or moderate lesion load, but it decreases appreciably in patients with a small lesion load.

Finally, Table 5 also suggests that the optimal threshold identified by means of the SI graph is able to determine the best trade-off values for all the similarity measures if evaluated conjunctly as a whole. 5.2. Statistical analysis on the effect of DSS on physician opinion
The statistical analysis performed has been aimed at evaluat-ing the extent the proposed DSS has an influence on the diagnostic tasks of physicians, and whether this influence can be quantified.

In such a sense, a study was arranged and involved a team of 10 volunteer students working for the specialty of Radiology at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Naples  X  X  X ederico II X  X .
Under the pretense of measuring their diagnostic performance, each participant was presented with a sequence of 3 MR studies containing in total 25 WMPLs. After seeing a WMPL, the partici-pants had to give a dichotomous normal/abnormal diagnosis. The system then provided its own suggestion.

Since the dichotomous diagnoses were collected, it was pos-sible to quantify the effect of a contradiction, i.e. DSS differs from student opinion on diagnosis. In particular, the correct diagnosis (gold standard) was known for all 25 WMPLs. Of these WMPLs, only 14 were actual lesions. The WMPLs were chosen to cover a wide range of diagnostic difficulty. Moreover, to investigate the effect of a disagreement, the proposed DSS was set up with an ad-hoc configuration in order to contradict radiology students on purpose and without their knowledge. In particular, by exploiting the gold standard known for the 25 WMPLs, the DSS was forced to give a wrong diagnosis for 8 of 25 WMPLs.

This setup was necessary as, otherwise, there might never be a disagreement between the system, which was built with the expertise of a team of neuroradiologists and the participating radiology students. As a result, the participants did not know that some of the DSS answers they were given were false. In this way, it was possible to determine how physicians reacted when the DSS provided concordant and discordant suggestions. In particu-lar, the system has been evaluated from the point of view of the following motivating question: Do physicians change their opinion when contradicted by the
DSS more often when the DSS output is not only a dichot-omous suggestion but also contains both a confidence and a semantically defined explanation of it?
In particular, the students X  responses have been analyzed to see whether there is any difference in the willingness to follow the DSS outputs when the latter are composed of the only dichotomous diagnosis (i.e. normal/abnormal tissue) or when they include also the confidence of diagnosis on an ordinal scale and an explanation of it that is semantically formalized and, for this reason, simple and intuitive to be understood also by a non-technical audience.
In such a sense, the behavior of the participants was investi-gated by applying the chi-square analysis. In more detail, the dataset for the analysis was built in the following way. Each participant was presented with the sequence of 3 MR studies containing 25 WMPLs. For all the WMPLs, the participants gave their dichotomous normal/abnormal diagnosis and, then, the DSS provided its own diagnosis linked to the pertaining MR images. Over all 10 participants and 25 WMPLs, the students X  initial dichotomous diagnosis disagreed with that of the DSS in 69 cases. In 10 of these cases (14.49%), the students changed their opinion to follow the DSS suggestion. After this first step, the system provided again its own diagnosis for all the cases and, in addition, it also reported both the confidence and the explanation of its Threshold diagnosis. Here, out of 69 cases, 27 students (39.13%) changed their opinion to follow the DSS suggestion.
 From this material, a 2 2 contingency table (shown in Table 6 ) involving the variables DSS suggestion ( DSS diagnosis ,
DSS diagnosis+confidence+explanation ) and physician opinion ( change , no change ) has been constructed with all 69 cases in which there is disagreement between the students X  and the DSS X  X  diagnosis.

It has been also hypothesized that 10 opinion changes when the system provided only its own diagnosis (out of 69 times the system advised against the initial diagnosis) are significantly different from 27 cases when the system provided also its confidence and explanation. This means that the null hypothesis to be tested with the chi-square analysis was the following:
Ho: there is no pattern of relationship between the students X  changes of opinion and the type of suggestion produced by the DSS.
 As first step of the analysis, the cross-tabulation reported in
Table 7 has been calculated, showing that the expected count frequency in each of the four cells generated by the factorial combination of DSS suggestion and physician opinion is greater than 5. This means that the analysis does not violate the main assumption underlying the chi-square test, i.e. the latter should only be applied when at least 80% of the cells have expected frequencies of five or larger. Otherwise, applying the analysis when there are fewer cells with this minimum expected fre-quency can lead to inaccurate results.

After that, the Pearson Chi-Square test has been performed in order to test the validity of the null hypothesis. According to the results generated, w 2 ( df  X  1)  X  10,672, p o 0.001, it has been possible to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between the values on the variable DSS suggestion and values on the variable physician opinion , in the population represented in the sample. In other words, the students X  opinion changes when the system provided only its own diagnosis are significantly different from the cases when the system provided also the linked confidence and explanation. In particular, as reported in the cross-tabulation, it can be seen that the students, who were given with the DSS diagnosis and its confidence and explanation, have showed a major and significant willingness to follow the DSS outputs and change their initial opinion. 6. Discussion and conclusions
The ontology-based fuzzy decision support system provides a knowledge-based method to automatically support neuroradiol-ogists in the WML classification with high sensitivity and speci-ficity for all the patient categories.

The DSS encodes high-level medical knowledge elicited from experts in terms of ontologies and fuzzy rules and applies such a knowledge in conjunction with a FIRE inference engine so as to classify WMLs and determine their volumes. Its output is a textual report containing a dichotomous (normal/abnormal) diag-nosis and the confidence of this diagnosis, expressed on an ordinal scale; moreover, the reasoning path executed and the strength level calculated for each rule fired are also returned in order to provide an explanation of the diagnosis produced.
Ontologies are used to represent the semantic structure of the expert X  X  knowledge and to provide a formulation of the DSS outcomes extremely simple and intuitive to be read and under-stood also by a non-technical audience. Fuzzy logic is used to handle fuzziness of input dataset and reproduce the expert X  X  decision-making process to classify WMLs with further capability of attributing a confidence measure to the diagnosis produced.
The proposed DSS produces binary classifications with high sensitivity and specificity. The ROC curve for all the patients shows that, at the optimal threshold, the overall sensitivity is 0.8787, with a specificity of 0.7562.

Therefore, similarity measures relative to the lesion volume are used to provide better information on the quality of the classification. In this sense, the use of the similarity measures ( SI , OF and EF ) enables to evaluate the binary classifications in a quantitative and objective way. The values of SI and OF for the categories of all patients and patients with moderate and large lesion load are higher than 0.94 for the optimal threshold. An SI value greater than 0.7 resembles an excellent agreement as stated in Bartko (1991) . For the class of patients with large lesion load these values even exceed the value of 0.95.

Both the ROC curves and the similarity measures also suggest that the proposed DSS produces better results for patients with a large lesion load than for ones with a small lesion load. From a theoretical point of view, this can be caused by a somewhat lower sensitivity in the detection of subcortical small lesions with a low percentage of surrounding WM and by a somewhat lower specificity in the classification of small symmetrical brain tissues since topological features are not taken into account in this study.
More precisely, these tissues, very similar to WM lesions in terms of the evaluated features, should not be classified as actual lesions since positioned symmetrically in the MR image. From a more practical point of view, this can be explained by the fact that small errors have a relatively larger effect on a smaller reference volume.

Moreover, the ROC curve for patients with a large lesion load first follows, closer than the other curves, both the left-hand and top borders of the ROC space and, then, inverts this trend. It is worth noting that this does not indicate a wrong behavior, but it can be explained by the fact that there is less uncertainty in the classification of large lesions than in the other situations since the presence of border-line lesions is very limited in this scenario.
As a matter of fact, the SI graph for patients with a large lesion load is significantly flat and indicates the invariance of the classification response, which remains approximately the same even with thresholds running from 0 to 1. As a result, the variation of thresholds does not cause a sensible improvement in terms of sensitivity for patients with a large lesion load.
The SI is not only used as a measure for the accuracy of the classification, but also with the aim of determining the optimal threshold to generate discrete outputs from the continuous appraisal values obtained by the fuzzy engine. For all the patient categories, this threshold is approximately 0.5. The SI graphs are considerably flat, which indicates the robustness of the optimal threshold. However, in many cases the choice of the threshold may be also an expert decision that depends on the acceptable ratio between false positive and false negative classified voxels.
At present, many studies on MS brain lesion segmentation have been published that describe and evaluate the results in quantitative terms by comparison of lesion volume or by analysis of the number of correctly or misclassified lesions ( Alfano et al., 2000; Akselrod-Ballin et al., 2009; Anbeek et al., 2004; Freifeld et al., 2009; Khayati et al., 2008; Sajja et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2002; Wels et al., 2008, Zijdenbos et al., 2002 ).
 A comparison with these studies highlights that the present
DSS is able to achieve a lower classification accuracy and to determine a smaller lesion volume in some cases. This is due to the fact that the proposed DSS has been thought for obtaining not only a sufficiently high classification accuracy, but also for finding out how the system can be deeply consulted and easily under-stood with the final aim of being most useful for difficult cases, where physicians might not be sure about their diagnoses.
Differently, the systems proposed in the cited studies are predominantly devised to maximize only the diagnostic perfor-mance, without taking into consideration whether their outcomes are suitable to the physicians X  needs and, thus, whether they can support physicians in a real clinical environment. Indeed, most part of them provides only a dichotomous diagnosis without reporting any simple insight as to how they work, i.e. any clear and direct interpretation of their diagnostic results. This is the reason why they are scarcely appealing and trustworthy for the physicians and so few of them are now in routine clinical use.
This consideration has been supported by the results of the statistical analysis reported in this work, which has revealed that radiology students who were given not only with a dichotomous diagnosis, but also with other information aimed at explaining the diagnosis and measuring its trustworthiness, have showed a major willingness (more precisely, an increase of changes equal to 24.64%) to follow the DSS outputs and change their initial opinion.

As a result, the strength of the proposed DSS with respect to the other existing systems can be summarized in the ability of aiding physicians in arriving at a diagnosis by providing, as suggestion, not only a dichotomous diagnosis, but also the confidence of diagnosis, expressed on an ordinal scale, and the linked explanation, semantically formalized by means of ontolo-gical concepts and properties. This is the reason why the present
DSS is extremely simple and intuitive to be understood also by a non-technical audience and can actually support physicians in a real clinical environment.

In conclusion, the presented DSS offers an innovative and valuable way to perform automated WML classification in real clinical environments. Moreover, since both the knowledge-based model and the fuzzy reasoning method have a general basis, the system is undoubtedly applicable to many other classification problems, for instance, classification of gray matter or cerebrosp-inal fluid. Finally, the encouraging results given by the experi-mental evaluation suggest that the system could be proficiently utilized on routine MR diagnostic scans or in large and long-itudinal population studies with the remarkable aim of improving diagnosis and prognosis for patients affected by MS.
