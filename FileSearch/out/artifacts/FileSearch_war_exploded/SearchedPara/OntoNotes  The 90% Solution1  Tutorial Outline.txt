 stitute of University of Southern California, University of Colora do, University of Pennsylvania and Bran-deis University. The goal of the OntoNotes project is to provide lin guistic data annotated with a skeletal representation of the literal meaning of sentences including synt actic parse, predicate-argument structure, coreference, and word senses linked to an ontology, allowing a new generation of language understanding technologies to be developed with new functional capabilities.
 covering various layers of linguistic annotation. This is probably t he first time that data of such quality has been available in large quantities covering multiple genres (news wire, broadcast news, broadcast conver-sation and weblogs) and languages (English, Chinese and Arabic) . The guiding principle has been to find a  X  X weet spot X  in the space of inter-tagger agreement , productivity , and depth of representation . The most effective use of this resource for research requires simultaneo us access to multiple layers of annotation. This has been made possible by representing the corpus with a relation al database to accommodate the dense connectedness of the data and ensure consistency across layer s. In order to facilitate ease of understanding and manipulability, the database has also been supplemented wit h a object-oriented Python API. describe the various layers of annotations in some detail and discu ss the linguistic principles and some-times practical considerations behind the important design decision s that shapes the corpus. We will also describe the salient differences between the three languages a t each layer of annotation and how linguistic peculiarities of different languages were handled in the data.
 decisions that went into the creation of the architecture of the da tabase and the individual tables comprising it, along with issues that came up during the representation proce ss and compromises that were made without sacrificing some primary objectives one of which being the ind ependent existence of each layer that is necessary to allow multi-site collaboration. We will expl ain how the database schema attempts to interconnect all the layers. Then we will go into the details of th e Python API that allows easy access to each of the layers and show that by making the objects closely resem ble database tables, the API allows for their flexible integration. This will be followed by a hands-on working se ssion. 1. Annotation Layers 2. Data Access API This tutorial is designed for people interested in using one or more l ayers of OntoNotes in their research to further language understanding through improved shallow sem antic analysis. Detailed knowledge of any of the layers is not necessary. Some familiarity with Python would be p referable.
