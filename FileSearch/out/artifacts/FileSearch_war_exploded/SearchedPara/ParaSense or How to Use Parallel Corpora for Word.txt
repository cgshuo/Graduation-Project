 Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the NLP task that consists in selecting the correct sense of a polysemous word in a given context. Most state-of-the-art WSD systems are supervised classifiers that are trained on manually sense-tagged corpora, which are very time-consuming and expensive to build (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006) . In order to over-come this acquisition bottleneck (sense-tagged cor-pora are scarce for languages other than English), we decided to take a multilingual approach to WSD, that builds up the sense inventory on the basis of the Europarl parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005). Using translations from a parallel corpus implicitly deals with the granularity problem as finer sense distinc-tions are only relevant as far as they are lexicalized in the target translations. It also facilitates the in-tegration of WSD in multilingual applications such as multilingual Information Retrieval (IR) or Ma-chine Translation (MT). Significant improvements in terms of general MT quality were for the first time reported by Carpuat and Wu (2007) and Chan et al. (2007). Both papers describe the integration of a dedicated WSD module in a Chinese-English statis-tical machine translation framework and report sta-tistically significant improvements in terms of stan-dard MT evaluation metrics.

Several studies have already shown the validity of using parallel corpora for sense discrimination (e.g. (Ide et al., 2002)), for bilingual WSD mod-ules (e.g. (Gale and Church, 1993; Ng et al., 2003; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Chan and Ng, 2005; Da-gan and Itai, 1994)) and for WSD systems that use a combination of existing WordNets with multilin-gual evidence (Tufis  X  et al., 2004). The research de-scribed in this paper is novel as it presents a truly multilingual classification-based approach to WSD that directly incorporates evidence from four other languages. To this end, we build further on two well-known research ideas: (1) the possibility to use parallel corpora to extract translation labels and features in an automated way and (2) the assump-tion that incorporating evidence from multiple lan-guages into the feature vector will be more infor-mative than a more restricted set of monolingual or bilingual features. Furthermore, our WSD system does not use any information from external lexical resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or Eu-roWordNet (Vossen, 1998). Starting point of the experiments was the six-lingual sentence-aligned Europarl corpus that was used in the SemEval-2010  X  X ross-Lingual Word Sense Dis-ambiguation X  (CLWSD) task (Lefever and Hoste, 2010b). The task is a lexical sample task for twenty English ambiguous nouns that consists in assign-ing a correct translation in the five supported tar-get languages (viz. French, Italian, Spanish, Ger-man and Dutch) for an ambiguous focus word in a given context. In order to detect the relevant transla-tions for each of the twenty ambiguous focus words, we ran GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) with its de-fault settings for all focus words. This word align-ment output was then considered to be the label for the training instances for the corresponding classi-fier (e.g. the Dutch translation is the label that is used to train the Dutch classifier). By considering this word alignment output as oracle information, we re-defined the CLWSD task as a classification task.
To train our five classifiers (English as input lan-guage and French, German, Dutch, Italian and Span-ish as focus languages), we used the memory-based learning (MBL) algorithm implemented in TIMBL (Daelemans and Hoste, 2002), which has success-fully been deployed in previous WSD classification tasks (Hoste et al., 2002). We performed heuris-tic experiments to define the parameter settings for the classifier, leading to the selection of the Jef-frey Divergence distance metric, Gain Ratio feature weighting and k = 7 as number of nearest neigh-bours. In future work, we plan to use an optimized word-expert approach in which a genetic algorithm performs joint feature selection and parameter op-timization per ambiguous word (Daelemans et al., 2003).

For our feature vector creation, we combined a set of English local context features and a set of binary bag-of-words features that were extracted from the aligned translations. 2.1 Training Feature Vector Construction We created two experimental setups. The first training set incorporates the automatically generated word alignments as labels. We applied an automatic post-processing step on these word alignments in or-der to remove leading and trailing determiners and prepositions. In future work, we will investigate other word alignment strategies and measure the im-pact on the classification scores. The second training set uses manually verified word alignments as labels for the training instances. This second setup is then to be considered as the upper bound on the current experimental setup.

All English sentences were preprocessed by means of a memory-based shallow parser (MBSP) (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005) that performs tokenization, Part-of-Speech tagging and text chunking. The preprocessed sentences were used as input to build a set of commonly used WSD features related to the English input sentence:  X  features related to the focus word itself being  X  local context features related to a window of
In addition to these well known monolingual fea-tures, we extracted a set of binary bag-of-words fea-tures from the aligned translation that are not the target language of the classifier (e.g. for the Dutch classifier, we extract bag-of-words features from the Italian, Spanish, French and German aligned trans-lations). In order to extract useful content words, we first ran Part-of-Speech tagging and lemmatisa-tion by means of the Treetagger (Schmid, 1994) tool. Per ambiguous focus word, a list of content words (nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs) was extracted that occurred in the aligned translations of the En-glish sentences containing the focus word. One bi-nary feature per selected content word was then cre-ated per ambiguous word:  X 0 X  in case the word does not occur in the aligned translation of this instance, and  X 1 X  in case the word does occur in the aligned translation of the training instance. 2.2 Test Feature Vector Construction For the creation of the feature vectors for the test in-stances, we follow a similar strategy as the one we used for the creation of the training instances. The first part of the feature vector contains the English local context features that were also extracted for the training instances. For the construction of the bag-of-words features however, we need to adopt a different approach as we do not have aligned trans-lations for the English test instances at our disposal. We decided to deploy a novel strategy that uses the Google Translate API 1 to automatically gener-ate a translation for all English test instances in the five supported languages. Online machine transla-tions tools have already been used before to create artificial parallel corpora that were used for NLP tasks such as for instance Named Entity Recogni-tion (Shah et al., 2010).

In a next step the automatically generated transla-tion was preprocessed in the same way as the train-ing translations (Part-of-Speech-tagged and lemma-tized). The resulting lemmas were then used to con-struct the same set of binary bag-of-words features that were stored for the training instances of the am-biguous focus word. To evaluate our five classifiers, we used the sense in-ventory and test set of the SemEval  X  X ross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation X  task. The sense inven-tory was built up on the basis of the Europarl corpus: all retrieved translations of a polysemous word were manually grouped into clusters, which constitute dif-ferent senses of that given word. The test instances were selected from the JRC-ACQUIS Multilingual Parallel Corpus 2 and BNC 3 . To label the test data, native speakers provided their top three translations from the predefined clusters of Europarl translations, in order to assign frequency weights to the set of gold standard translations. A more detailed descrip-tion of the construction of the data set can be found in Lefever and Hoste (2010a).
 As evaluation metrics, we used both the SemEval BEST precision metric from the CLWSD task as well as a straightforward accuracy measure. The SemEval metric takes into account the frequency weights of the gold standard translations: transla-tions that were picked by different annotators get a higher weight. For the BEST evaluation, systems can propose as many guesses as the system believes are correct, but the resulting score is divided by the number of guesses. In this way, systems that out-put a lot of guesses are not favoured. For a more detailed description of the SemEval scoring scheme, we refer to McCarthy and Navigli (2007). Follow-ing variables are used for the SemEval precision for-mula. Let H be the set of annotators, T the set of test items and h i the set of responses for an item i  X  T for annotator h  X  H . Let A be the set of items from T where the system provides at least one answer and a i : i  X  A the set of guesses from the system for item i . For each i , we calculate the multiset union ( H i ) for all h i for all h  X  H and for each unique type ( res ) in H i that has an associated frequency ( f req res ).

The second metric we use is a straightforward ac-curacy measure, that divides the number of correct answers by the total amount of test instances. As a baseline, we selected the most frequent lem-matized translation that resulted from the automated word alignment (GIZA++). We also compare our results with the two winning SemEval-2 systems for the Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task, UvT-WSD (that only participated for Dutch and Spanish) and T3-COLEUR. The UvT-WSD sys-tem (van Gompel, 2010), that also uses a k-nearest neighbor classifier and a variety of local and global context features, obtained the best scores for Span-ish and Dutch in the SemEval CLWSD competi-tion. Although we also use a memory-based learner, our method is different from this system in the way the feature vectors are constructed. Next to the incorporation of similar local context features, we also include evidence from multiple languages in our feature vector. For French, Italian and Ger-man however, the T3-COLEUR system (Guo and Diab, 2010) outperformed the other systems in the SemEval competition. This system adopts a differ-ent approach: during the training phase a monolin-gual WSD system processes the English input sen-tence and a word alignment module is used to ex-tract the aligned translation. The English senses to-gether with their aligned translations (and probabil-ity scores) are then stored in a word sense transla-tion table, in which look-ups are performed during the testing phase. This system also differs from the Uvt-WSD and ParaSense systems in the sense that the word senses are derived from WordNet, whereas the other systems do not use any external resources.
The results for all five classifiers are listed in two tables. Table 1 gives an overview of the SemEval-2010 weighted precision scores, whereas Table 2 shows the more straightforward accuracy figures. Both tables list the scores averaged over all twenty test words for the baseline (most frequent word alignment), the best SemEval system (for a given language) and the two ParaSense setups: one that ex-clusively uses automatically generated word align-ments, and one that uses the verified word alignment labels. For both setups we trained three flavors of the ParaSense system (1: local context + translation features, 2: translation features and 3: local context features).

The classification results show that for both se-tups all three flavors of the ParaSense system easily beat the baseline. Moreover, the ParaSense system clearly outperforms the winning SemEval systems, except for Spanish where the scores are similar. As all systems, viz. the two SemEval systems as well as the three flavors of the ParaSense system, were trained on the same Europarl data, the scores illus-trate the potential advantages of using a multilingual approach. Although we applied a very basic strategy for the selection of our bag-of-words translation fea-tures (we did not perform any filtering on the trans-lations except for Part-of-Speech information), we observe that for three languages the full feature vec-tor outperforms the classifier that uses the more tra-ditional WSD local context features. For Dutch, the classifier that merely uses translation features even outperforms the classifier that uses the local context features. In previous research (Lefever and Hoste, 2011), we showed that the classifier using evidence from all different languages was constantly better than the ones using less or no multilingual evidence. In addition, the scores also degraded relatively to the number of translation features that was used. As we used a different set of translation features for the lat-ter pilot experiments (we only used the translations of the ambiguous words instead of the full bag-of-words features we used for the current setup), we need to confirm this trend with more experiments using the current feature sets.

Another important observation is that the classifi-cation scores degrade when using the automatically generated word alignments, but only to a minor ex-tent. This clearly shows the viability of our setup. Further experiments with different word alignment settings and symmetrisation methods should allow us to further improve the results with the automat-ically generated word alignments. Using the non-validated labels makes the system very flexible and language-independent, as all steps in the feature vec-tor creation can be run automatically. We presented preliminary results for a multilingual classification-based approach to Word Sense Dis-ambiguation. In addition to the commonly used monolingual local context features, we also incor-porate bag-of-word features that are built from the aligned translations. Although there is still a lot of room for improvement on the feature base, our re-sults show that the ParaSense system clearly outper-forms state-of-the-art systems for all languages, ex-cept for Spanish where the results are very similar. As all steps are run automatically, this multilingual approach could be an answer for the acquisition bot-tleneck, as long as there are parallel corpora avail-able for the targeted languages. Although large mul-tilingual corpora are still rather scarce, we strongly believe there will be more parallel corpora available in the near future (large companies and organiza-tions disposing of large quantities of parallel text, internet corpora such as the ever growing Wikipedia corpus, etc.). Another line of research could be the exploitation of comparable corpora to acquire addi-tional training data.
 In future work, we want to run additional exper-iments with different classifiers (SVM) and apply a genetic algorithm to perform joint feature selec-tion, parameter optimization and instance selection. We also plan to expand our feature set by including global context features (content words from the En-glish sentence) and to examine the relationship be-tween the performance and the number (and nature) of languages that is added to the feature vector. In addition, we will apply semantic analysis tools (such as LSA) on our multilingual bag-of-words sets in order to detect latent semantic topics in the multi-lingual feature base. Finally, we want to evaluate to which extent the integration of our WSD output helps practical applications such as Machine Trans-lation or Information Retrieval.
