 Thai Romanization refers to the method of writing Thai word with English alphabet, which somehow is not standardized. The problem is more prominent for Thai proper names. Personal preferences affect how ones spell names using English alphabets significantly. In some cases, name pronunciations are strictly preserved (transcription) while in many cases spellings reflecting the roots of the names are preferred over how they would sound (transliteration). In this work, we propose a Thai Romanization approach where popularity of Romanization patterns is taken into consideration. A Romanization approach that is capable of producing a list of probable hypotheses of Romanized string given a Thai proper name would be beneficial in searching activi-ties relating to retrieving people-related documents published in either Thai or English when names are used as the search keywords. Romanization is typically approached in two steps: text segmentation and writing method-specific units such as words, syllables, or some other orthographic-based units. The latter proposes the spelling of the original string in the destination writing system. Poovarawan [1], Sornlertlamvanich [2] pr oposed a dictionary-based. Unregistered words will not be recognized. Theeramunkong [3] proposed a method based on a de-word problem. Still, it cannot handle cases with ambiguituies. Aroonmanakun [4] proposed a segmentation method based on syllable trigram models. Romanization based on this segmentation method yields reasonable result. However, the method is not designed to handle the transliteration type of Romanization where resulting Eng-lish strings aim at preserving some original linguistic information rather than retaining double-syllable Romanized string  X  X hoti X . Thai graphemes are converted to Thai phoneme sequences before they are then mapped to their closest matched English phoneme sequences. Finally, the best se-quence of English graphemes is then hypothesized based on the phonemes. Charoen-porn et al. [5] and Aroonmanakun et al [6] both deployed corpus-based statistical segmentation methods to segment Thai words into syllables. However, the former chose to perform the writing system translation step by relying on a set of hand-Institute in 1984 together with some deterministic mapping tables. dle the unsystematic character of Thai proper name Romanization. Therefore, we pro-pose a data-driven approach that automatical ly learns the character mapping between Thai and English via a set of newly proposed units generically called  X  X ram X . These pronunciations) of both languages at the same time. 44 alphabets are used to represent 21 Thai consonant sounds. All of them can be used for consonantal phonemes in the syllable-initial position. Three of them can be com-bined with other consonants to form true consonant clusters. Although, theoretically, all 44 consonantal alphabets can be used to represent 8 syllable-final consonantal phonemes, some are more popular than the others. In many occasions, a string of mul-tiple consonants could represent only one phoneme, and many occurrences are governed by exceptions rather than precise rules. 34 symbols, some of which are con-consonants, are used to represent Thai vowel phonemes including monophthongs as well as diphthongs. 5 Tone symbols are superimposed to Thai syllabic representation to govern the tonal aspect of each syllable, which is also affects by the base consonan-tal alphabets representing the phoneme in the syllable-initial position. 4.1 Name Decomposition and Gram Accumulation In this work, the spelling of each name is looked as if it is the concatenation of a se-quence of basic units. The attributes of each one of these units are their alphabet se-quences in both the original and the destination systems, which in this case are Thai and English respectively. These arrangements of these units will constrain the spelling of the names in both languages. Although resulting units with meaning are preferable, it is not a requirement for units to be meaningful. Therefore, these units are referred to by using a generic name called Gram s, in contrary to the name Morph adopted in examples of the name decomposition.  X  X  X   X  sompol  X  X  :som  X   X  :pol analyzed. Each Gram must at least consist of alphabets for the corresponding syllable-initial phoneme and alphabets for the vowel phoneme. Although single-syllable Grams are preferable, multi-syllable Grams ar e also allowed to ensure that the de-composition of names do not produce any Grams that their Thai spellings only con-would have made the decomposition generate too many possible hypotheses. Furthermore, if the vowel alphabet of a syllable is a type of vowel that requires man-datory coda consonants, the alphabets for the consonant and the vowel cannot be separated. This is, again, to prevent the over-generation problem.
 ally on a large name corpus. Here, we semi-automatically process names in our train-ing/development set (Details about the name corpus used in this work will be described later in this paper.) in several batches of a couple thousands names. Grams obtained from one batch are added to the lexicon which will be used for the automatic decomposition of the names in the next batch. Manual adjustment is performed on the result of the automatic decomposition of each batch before new Grams are added to the lexicon. The process can be illustrated in Figure 2. a syllable sequences using the method proposed by Aroonmanakun et al. [4]. Then, given the accumulated Grams from previous batches, a right-to-left searching is per-must replicates a Gram in the accumulated Gram lexicon. This search attempt can multiple failure. quence of Grams in the accumulated Gram lexicon. No manual adjustments are needed and no new Grams are added into the Gram lexicon. some unmatched English alphabets at the beginning of the name. An expert judgment is required whether to pair up the Thai sy llable with the remaining English alphabets and add a new Gram into the Gram lexicon. Otherwise, a manual adjustment has to be made on the entire name. Grams. In this case, an alphabet-mapping decomposition is tried. This method of de-composition first tokenized th e associated sequence of English alphabets so that each resulting token is either a group of alphabets representing the English vowel, a group of alphabets representing syllable-initial consonants, or a group of alphabets repre-senting consonants in the coda positions. A simple algorithm based on a Thai-English alphabet-wise mapping is then used to combine some English tokens together so that it results in a one-to-one mapping between the Thai syllables and the English tokens. Manual adjustments are sometimes needed before the new Grams are added to the Gram lexicon. dens are less severe when the Gram lexicon grows larger. Note that in the first batch multiple failure case and will be treated accordingly. 4.2 Gram-Based Romanization With the Gram lexicon, A Thai name to be romanized can be decomposed into multi-ple sequences of Grams constrained by its corresponding Thai spelling. Statistical language and phase transition models are used to give a popularity score to each pos-sible Gram sequence. The system picks the sequence with the highest score to be the hypothesis of choice. Then, Romanization can be completed simply by concatenating the English alphabets of the Grams in the corresponding sequence together.
 ber of alphabets in the Thai spelling of that name, the system first converts R to a se-(string of Thai alphabets) of a Gram app earing in our Gram lexicon using a right-to-left longest matching approach. must be a Gram in the lexicon. Here, we deploy the conditional probability of the se-quence E given T . The MAP criterion is deployed such that we will choose the best hypothesis E * for the given T such that: 
We will refer to the term p ( E ) as the  X  X -Gram score X  which can be computed us-ing the typical N-gram models of English alphabet strings. In this work, bigram mod-els are created from the name decomposition examples in the training/development set. However, only the English alphabets of each Gram are considered. In other words, when counting the number of Gram pairs to obtain the bigram models, two different Grams considered the same unit if their English spellings are the same. 
Similar to the problem of the machine translation problems in the sentence level, we view the term p ( T | E ) as the translation score. Assuming independency among the terms in T and that t i only depends on e i we have: and and is the total number of any Grams  X  that their associated English 5.1 Name Corpus A corpus of Thai first names and surnames were used for the training of all statistical models as well as for evaluating the proposed method. The corpus was constructed from a database of the names of students registered at Chulalongkorn University, mostly, in the last 10 years. Foreign names were excluded from the corpus. The cor-pus contains Thai spellings of 178,612 names together with their English counter-parts. 20% of the names were randomly picked as the test data set while the rest 80% observed in the process of introducing our Grams. 6.1 Construction of the Gram Lexicon Figure 3 compares the coverage percentages and the number of accumulated Grams names analyzed. 
As we can observe from the table, after analyzing the 22 batches of data in the training/development set, including manual adjustments that handle decomposition failures, 24,385 Grams cover 139,500 names in the set. Note that each of these Grams among these 24,385 Grams, there were around eight thousands unique tokens if only Thai alphabet sequences were considered, while the number is around twelve thou-sand if only English alphabet sequences were considered. 
From figure 3, we can see that the number of Grams grows rather linearly with the increasing of the number of names after some Grams (which, in this case, are around 35% of the total Grams) are already in th e lexicon. The coverage percentage also grows linearly with the increasing of the number of names already analyzed. 6.2 Romanization Results Table 1 compares the Romanization accuracies of the baseline and the proposed methods evaluated on the 35,722 names in the test data set. 
The Romanization accuracy percentage of the baseline method is around 18%. The fact that more than 80% of the names are romanized differently from what are listed in the test data set reflects the degree of complexity of Thai name Romanization. However, the highly-varied nature of the Thai name Romanization also exposes the preferences. The proposed method yield the best performance of almost 50% evalu-ated on the same data set. 
Figure 4 shows the recall rate percentages when N -best hypotheses are used. We where the recall rate grows from the values shown in table 4 (  X  44%  X  46%) to around 75% to 80% when 15-best hypotheses are used. Although the recall rate keeps in-creasing as the number of hypothesis increases, we can observe that the curves tend to saturate. Consequently, we can expect that using more hypotheses is not likely to push potheses does not single out the correct Romanization of a name, we can reasonably application in which not too many Romanization hypotheses from the proposed method are used as the search queries. This paper presents a Romanization method whose flexibility is more suitable for the Romanization of Thai names than a conventional Romanization method. Although it forms of a large number of Romanized name examples yield a better Romanization the proposed Gram-based models yield a satisfactory finding in terms of the Romani-zation results as well as the framework adopted in the construction of the Gram lexi-con from examples of more than one-hundred thousand names.
