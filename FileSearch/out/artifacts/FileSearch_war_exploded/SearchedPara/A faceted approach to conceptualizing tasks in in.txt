 1. Introduction resolved and to what extent the information retrieved helps users to achieve their goals. Users X  information problems, and their contexts, are various and thus need different types of information support. However, a big disadvantage of current
IR systems, including search engines and digital libraries, is that they typically offer support for only one type of information problem, and present search results based on the queries input regardless of users X  divergent tasks with different goals. As a result, users X  interactions in IR systems may be sub-optimal, and returned search results may not help users to achieve their goals. Therefore, it is necessary to explore how IR systems could adapt to a variety of users with different goals, contexts and types of information problems; that is, to contextualize and personalize interaction with IR systems.
 have led them to engage in information-seeking behavior, and the tasks that they need to accomplish in information seeking and in information searching, respectively. Various researchers have demonstrated that information behaviors and desired search results differ according to types of tasks at each of these three levels, that is, work tasks, information-seeking tasks, 1998). However, to date there has been no generally accepted and generally applicable classification of such tasks. In this paper, we present a classification of task which we believe addresses the problems of general applicability, with specific ref-erence to how this classification might help to understand and help make predictions of people X  X  information behaviors within IR systems.

Tasks are activities people attempt to accomplish in order to keep their work or life moving on. Work task has been de-fined from different perspectives (Algon, 1999; Hansen, 1999; J X rvelin &amp; Ingwersen, 2004; Vakkari, 2003 ). For the purpose of vation of information seeking. In information science, information-related task is frequently discussed. Information-seeking task refers to users X  general information problem, which could be satisfied through searching various information resources, such as people, paper-based documents, information systems, and so on, while information search task is defined as a task that users need to accomplish through effective interaction with information systems, for example, a user needs to search for journal papers related to the effects of global warming on climate change. Information systems include all sorts of online information resources, for example, traditional IR systems, search engines, digital libraries, and so on. This is the same way by which Wilson (1999) differentiated information-seeking behavior and information search behavior. He proposed a nested model of information behavior in order to depict information seeking and information search research areas. This model includes three levels: information behavior, information-seeking behavior, and information search behavior. He sug-gested that information behavior should be defined as a general area and information-seeking behavior should be a sub-set of information behavior, with the focus on  X  X  X he variety of methods people employ to discover, and gain access to information resources X  (1999, p. 263), whereas information search behavior should be defined as a sub-set of information-seeking behav-ior and is concerned with the interactions between users and information systems. Therefore, the difference between infor-mation seeking and information search lies in that users conduct information search only through information systems, but they may seek information from other sources, for example, human or printed documents.

Both information-seeking tasks and information search tasks are sub-tasks of work tasks, and information search tasks are sub-tasks of information-seeking tasks (Bystr X m &amp; Hansen, 2002, 2005 ). Hence, information-seeking tasks and informa-tion search tasks with respect to the same work tasks may have the same subject or topic. However, once users seek infor-mation only from information systems, seeking tasks are equal to search tasks.

Though work tasks, information-seeking tasks, and information search tasks are tasks at different levels, due to the nature of task, they should share some common aspects. This is the basis for developing a task classification which could be appli-cable to classifying tasks at all three levels. These common aspects of task are called  X  X  X acets X  in this study. The present study seeks to identify these facets and develop a faceted classification of task. This classification scheme could be a starting point to examine the relationships among work tasks, information-seeking tasks, information search tasks and information search behavior. Moreover, through this classification the effects of different facets of tasks on information search behavior could be investigated as well as how tasks as multi-faceted variables affect such behavior.

The present paper includes five sections. The following section concentrates on reviewing the related studies of work tasks by dividing them into group tasks and individual tasks. We then discuss the previous studies regarding informa-tion-related tasks. Since most studies address the relationships between search tasks and information searching behavior, this paper concentrates on reviewing the classification schemes of information search tasks. Task facets related to different task classification systems are identified throughout the review. We then present a faceted classification of task based on the reviewed literature, and offer some concluding comments. 2. Work tasks
Tasks have been considered as an important factor influencing human being X  X  behavior in social psychology and organi-zational management for a long time. In this area, work tasks are defined as tasks emerging from people X  X  everyday work. Researchers are interested in general work tasks and concerned with both group tasks and individual tasks. On the other hand, information scientists are concerned with the characteristics of human information behavior during task performance, and usually define work tasks as a whole picture of a person X  X  actual work which heavily relies on information seeking (Bystr X m, 2002 ), i.e., information intensive work task. Besides, individual tasks are placed in a central position in this area. This section addresses work task types emerging from information science, organizational management, and sociological psychology, and characterizes them into group tasks and individual tasks. 2.1. Group tasks
Zigurs and Buckland (1998) summarized the task classifications put forward in group and organizational research since 1950s. The different classifications identified various task types. For instance, Carter, Haythorn, and Howell (1950) classified tasks as Clerical, Discussion, Intellectual construction, Mechanical assembly, Motor coordination, and Reasoning based on different group activities; O X  X eill and Alexander (1971) labeled different tasks as Discussion, Decision, and Performance, respectively based on behavior requirements of intellective tasks; Steiner (1972) categorized tasks as Unitary vs. Divisible, Maximizing vs. Optimizing, Prescribed process vs. Permitted process on the basis of group member relationships and task performance processes; Davis, Laughlin, and Komorita (1976) and Laughlin (1980) classified tasks as Intellective vs. Decision (among cooperative groups), Two-person, two-choice tasks vs. Bargaining and negotiation vs. Coalition formation (among competitive or mixed-motive groups). The most widely employed task classifications in these areas are those of Hackman (1968) and McGrath (1984) . This section focuses on reviewing their classification schemes. 2.1.1. Hackman X  X  classification of intellective group tasks group performance. He categorized intellective group tasks as Production tasks, Discussion tasks, and Problem solving tasks.
Intellective tasks refer to problems which need to be solved with a correct answer and thus require reasoning and thinking activities during task performance (McGrath, 1984 ). The results indicated that task types impacted some dimensions of products. Task difficulty moderately affected product characteristics. The experiment also showed that the order of task pre-sentation had little influence on the products. Following Hackman X  X  task classification scheme for intellective group tasks, Kent and McGrath (1969) replicated and extended his findings.
 performance and member reactions. This study demonstrated that task types strongly affected both group performance and member reactions. They still used the three types of task and refined their definitions. Production tasks call for  X  X  X he produc-tion and presentation of ideas, images, or arrangements X  (p. 40); Discussion tasks ask for  X  X  X valuation of issues, usually with a requirement of group consensus X  (p. 40); Problem solving tasks  X  X  X equire members to spell out a course of action to be fol-lowed to resolve some specific problem X  (p. 40). Although this classification scheme merely focuses on intellective group tasks, as Hackman stated, it reflects some other facets of task, such as content and process. This classification of intellective group tasks has been widely utilized. For example, Kabanoff and O X  X rien (1979) examined the effects of task type and coop-eration on group products and performance. They operationalized task type as three types of intellective tasks X  X roduction,
Discussion, and Problem solving tasks, as Hackman and Vidmar (1970) defined. Aronson (1982) examined the relationships between group types, task types, and situational factors on the affective reactions, social interactions, and the quality of group products. Production, Discussion, and Problem solving tasks under both familiar and unfamiliar situations were investigated. 2.1.2. McGrath X  X  typology of tasks tasks and motor tasks (based on whether the presence of other people hinder or help performance), simple and complex tasks, and so on. After examining early task classification schemes, especially Hackman X  X  three types of task, McGrath iden-tified four processes needed for completing tasks, namely: Generate, Choose, Negotiate, and Execute. These four processes are four quadrants of his group task circumplex (McGrath, 1984, p. 61 ). In this circumplex, under each quadrant two task types are identified. The task types and explanations are listed in Table 1 . He claimed that this circumplex should be: (a) mutually exclusive; (b) collectively exhaustive; (c) logically related to one another; (d) useful. In this classification scheme process is the major task dimension considered.

Zigurs &amp; Buckland, 1998 ). This classification system is widely employed in many studies on Group Support System (GSS), team research, and computer-mediated communication (CMC). For example, Anderson (1993) investigated GSS and task dif-ferences. Task was operationalized as different task types labeled by McGrath, such as execute tasks, choose tasks, cooper-ative tasks, negotiate tasks, and so forth. Vianja (2003) attempted to propose a classification of experimental tasks for management information system (MIS) research. He presented a table including 60 tasks extracted from a number of studies and then categorized them based on McGrath X  X  taxonomy. In his view, this is an approach to developing a consistent use of a task classification scheme in MIS research. In addition, due to the nature of GSS, intellective tasks and decision-making tasks (preference tasks) are most frequently employed in such research. 2.2. Individual tasks tasks is not aimed at classifying group tasks as the classification schemes addressed in Section 2.1. Moreover, these classi-fication systems of task are closely related to specific organizations and work settings or specific situations. 2.2.1. Whitley and Frost X  X  scientific task types in a research laboratory dissemination channels in a research laboratory. Tasks are defined as different jobs in this laboratory; particularly, these jobs are related to scientific research. Based on  X  X  X ow scientific tasks are selected and problem defined X  (p. 538), these tasks are categorized as Responsibility tasks, Extension tasks, Development tasks, and Research tasks. Responsibility tasks are closely related to technology employed in the laboratory. Some scientists are responsible for the operation of the facility, assisting university users, trouble shooting and making minor adjustments to recording devices. Extension tasks are aimed at improv-ing the performance, utility and applications of the existing facility. Development tasks are concerned with developing a new technological facility. Research tasks formulate or test scientific theories, concepts, or models. These tasks embody different roles and responsibilities of scientists in the lab, which may determine the features of using and disseminating information. This task classification implies some dimensions of tasks, for instance, task doer X  X  specific role in a research setting. 2.2.2. Tushman X  X  task classification for the project task in R&amp;D organizations
Tushman (1978) explored how the match between a project X  X  communication patterns and project work characteristics impacted the project X  X  effectiveness. The discussion of task characteristics and task interdependence are deeply involved in his study. Task characteristics encompass task complexity, task differences, time orientation, goal difference, professional difference, cognitive difference, and task areas. Tushman pointed out that task characteristics may be key contingent factors influencing the technical communication in R&amp;D settings. In his view, task interdependence indicates  X  X  X he extent to which the project X  X  task requires working with other areas X  (p. 632). Task interdependence suggests that coordination, joint deci-sion making, and problem solving are necessary in order to complete the project tasks.

Task dimensions encompass time span of feedback, specific versus general problem orientation, and generation of new knowledge versus using existing knowledge and experience (Rosenbloom &amp; Wolek, 1970 ). These dimensions reflect the de-gree of task complexity. On the basis of these dimensions, Tushman categorized tasks in R&amp;D settings as Basic research, Ap-plied research, Development, and Technical service. Basic research intends to address a broad range of applications or the development of new knowledge in an area. Applied research employs basic knowledge to resolve a particular problem. This type of research creates and evaluates new concepts or components but not develop operational use. Development creates new products and processes based on the combination of existing concepts, facts, and theories or perhaps based on new knowledge. This kind of task solves a particular problem through exploratory study, design and testing of new components or systems. Technical service focuses on resolving technical issues using existing knowledge, improving cost/performance to existing products, processes or systems, and opening new markets for existing products. This classification scheme is built on dimensions of task complexity as mentioned above. The degree of complexity of these tasks decreases from Basic research to Technical services. 2.2.3. Algon X  X  task classification regarding a drug development project team
Algon (1997, 1999) explored the individual X  X  information-related behaviors (IRB) in the context of a project team. With regard to a specific group X  X  drug development team, a three-level task classification scheme was developed, which contains Meta-task, Categories, and Sub-categories. Interaction is the most important factor considered in Algon X  X  task classification due to its crucial role in a project team. It occurs among team members, ideas or information, and other things, so she labeled these tasks as Interaction with others, Interaction with ideas or information, and Interaction with things, respectively. These are  X  X eta-tasks X . Under Meta-tasks, tasks at the second level are called  X  X ategory X . This level includes seven types of task, including administrative, communication/facilitation, information location, report generation, analytic, strategic formula-tion/design, and operational. The third level is called  X  X ub-categories X , including specific task types reflecting the processes by which tasks are completed. These tasks are listed in Table 2 . It is noted that in each level the process is the basis of this classification scheme. 2.2.4. MacMullin and Taylor X  X  problem dimensions
According to MacMullin and Taylor (1984) , problems and their component dimensions represent the user X  X  situation, so they concentrated on the examination of problems and attempted to categorize problems based on information traits. A problem includes three components, namely, initial state, goal state, and process(es). In order to identify problem dimen-sions, MacMullin and Taylor (1984) explored information traits from the quantitative continuum, temporal continuum, solu-tion continuum, focus continuum, specificity of use continuum, substantive continuum, aggregation continuum and causal/ diagnostic continuum. Based on information traits, problem dimensions are proposed in Table 3 .

MacMullin and Taylor (1984) presented a comprehensive system of problem dimensions. Although they focus on prob-lems, in terms that the purpose of some tasks is to find solutions for problems, the dimensions of tasks should be closely related to those of problems. In particular, tasks and problems to some extent are interchangeable in information-seeking context. Therefore, their study provides insight into the study of task dimensions. However, the dimensions they proposed are always dichotomous, which is not realistic. For example, problems are not always only either well-structured or ill-structured. There exist some problems with both well-structured and ill-structured features, which are defined as semi-structured problems (Parsons &amp; Oja, 1998 ). 2.2.5. Campbell X  X  task classification scheme
Campbell (1988) suggested that objective task complexity  X  X  X mplies an increase in information load, information diversity, or rate of information change X  (p. 43), based on which led him to identify four basic complexity attributes: (1) multiple paths to tasks, (2) multiple desired outcomes of tasks, (3) conflicting interdependence among paths and desired outcomes, and (4) uncertain or probabilistic links among paths and desired outcomes. On the basis of these attributes, 16 types of task were identified. Campbell (1988) characterized all these tasks into Simple tasks, Decision tasks, Judgment tasks, Problem tasks, and Fuzzy tasks. According to him, Simple tasks contain none of the task complexity attributes. However, there exist a num-ber of desired outcomes as well as conflicting interdependence among outcomes for Decision tasks, while path multiplicity is irrelevant to them. Judgment tasks deal with conflicting and probabilistic nature of task information, but multiple desired outcomes and paths are not relevant to this category. Problem tasks involve multiple paths to only one desired outcome, and there exist conflicting interdependence among these paths; however, outcome multiplicity is irrelevant to problem tasks. Fuzzy tasks involve almost all attributes of task complexity. Moreover, uncertainty is associated with all kinds of tasks except Simple tasks. Table 4 shows the relationships between task types and complexity attributes. This classification is used by Zigurs and Buckland (1998) as the basis to explore the relations between task/technology fit and GSS effectiveness.
This classification scheme reflects different complexity degrees of task as well as the effort people have to exert in order to complete the task. Even if both Tushman (1978) and Campbell (1988) take objective task complexity into account, they consider different dimensions, thereby leading to the different task classification schemes. 2.2.6. Bystr X m and J X rvelin X  X  task classification
Bystr X m and J X rvelin (1995) investigated the relationship between task complexity, information types, and information sources. They categorized tasks as Automatic information processing tasks, Normal information processing tasks, Normal decision tasks, Known, genuine decision tasks, and Genuine decision tasks based on the degree of task complexity. Automatic information processing tasks are a priori completely determinable and could be automated. They are simple tasks and almost do not need to seek new information. Normal information processing tasks are almost completely a priori determinable, but require some case-based arbitration concerns. That is, some adjustments may be needed depending on specific situation and constraints. Only part of the process and information needed of this type of tasks is a priori indeterminable. Normal decision tasks are still structured tasks, but case-based arbitration plays a major role. With respect to Known, genuine decision tasks, the type and structure of the result is a priori known, but the process and information requirements for this sort of task are largely indeterminable. For Genuine decision tasks, the results, processes, and information requirements are indeterminable. They are unexpected and unstructured.

In Bystr X m and J X rvelin X  X  study, tasks were viewed as a context leading to information activities. Information needs, seek-ing, and use are seen as a part of task performance process. Task complexity is regarded as an important characteristic that influences user X  X  information behavior. It is defined in terms of  X  X  X erceived a priori determinability of information inputs, pro-cessing, and outputs that touch on research considering task uncertainty and analyzability X  ( Bystr X m, 2002, p. 582 ). Based on the degree of a priori determinability of a task, the authors assumed that  X  X  X he more familiar a task performer is with the task requirements, the less complex the task is perceived X  (Bystr X m, 2002, p. 583 ). Starting from this understanding, the authors examined how task complexity was associated with information types and sources. According to Vakkari (2003) , this per-spective may provide a helpful entry point for research into tasks and information searching.

Bystr X m and J X rvelin (1995) understood task complexity as a subjective variable closely related to users X  priori determi-nability, namely, subjective task complexity. However, Tushman (1978) and Campbell (1988) took into account objective task complexity which is determined by several task dimensions or task attributes. This suggests that both perspectives are necessary to take into consideration to classify tasks. 2.3. Information intensive work tasks
In information science, Xie (1998) and Bystr X m and Hansen (2002, 2005) discussed information intensive work tasks which involve information-related tasks, such as information-seeking tasks, information search tasks (information retrieval tasks), and interactive intentions.
 2.3.1. Xie X  X  user-goal based task types relationship between user goals and their information seeking and searching behaviors. She claimed that tasks and goals were inseparable in information-seeking process, and classified user goals into four levels: Long-term goal, Leading search goal, Current search goal, and Interactive intention. Long-term goal is a user X  X  personal goal which s/he pursues for a quite a long time, maybe for most of his/her life. Leading search goal refers to a user X  X  current task-related goal that leads to infor-mation search. Current search goal refers to what search results a user intends to obtain. Interactive intention refers to the sub-goals that a user has to achieve in the process of accomplishing his/her current search goal.
 mulated, by which information-seeking strategies are developed. The process shows that the long-term goal influences the leading search goal, which leads to the current search goal. The current search goal determines the interactive intention. In other words, the higher level of goal impacts the lower levels. More important, Xie further classified leading search goals, current search goals, and interactive intentions. These categories are shown in Table 5 .
 worktasks(leadingsearch goals(professionaluse,educationalassignment,andsoon)),search tasks(currentsearchgoals),and interactive tasks (interactive intentions). Therefore, this classification system is more comprehensive compared to the others discussed above since most classification schemes of task only target one level of task, but Xie X  X  covers different levels of task which are related to information seeking. In addition, like the current classification schemes, it is a hierarchical classification scheme. The task types identified in this scheme imply some facets, such as goal, product (i.e. search results), and process. 2.3.2. Bystr X m and Hansen X  X  task types on the basis of discussion of work tasks in information intensive environments. According to them, tasks can be defined in three levels: work tasks, information-seeking tasks, and information search tasks.
 this level. These factors include work task characteristics, task performers X  prior knowledge and experience of the domain and task. Information-seeking tasks are sub-tasks of work tasks. They could also be viewed as tasks that include  X  X  X ask construc-tion, task performance, and task completion X  (p. 244). Information-seeking tasks are treated as a central part of information intensive work tasks. Related factors include task performer X  X  knowledge and experience, information-seeking strategies, and source selection. Information search tasks are viewed as sub-tasks of information-seeking tasks. From this perspective, seek-ing information motivates specific searching in certain information systems, including electronic and non-electronic systems.
Information seeking does not focus on activities with any specific information systems or human information sources, but information search is a specific behavior in a specific information system. Information retrieval tasks are associated with the utilization of a single or several databases through a search engine in electronic environment. Hence, it is reasonable to see that information retrieval tasks are special cases of information search tasks. The factors considered at the information search task level include source selection, search approach or strategy, IR techniques, and IR interaction.
 tasks at the different level. These three types of task involved in the course of information seeking are closely associated with one another.
 2.3.3. Ingwersen and J X rvelin X  X  task types
According to Ingwersen and J X rvelin (2005) , the notion of work tasks is central to information seeking and retrieval and it has been extended to cover non-job-related tasks or interests, i.e., daily-life tasks. There are three types of work and daily-life tasks, such as natural work tasks, simulated work tasks, and requests for information. Natural work tasks emerge from real life; simulated work tasks are designed for research, for example, Borlund X  X  simulated work task sit-uations (2000) ; requests for information refers to the tasks which assign search topics or requirements representing information need, for example, the tasks assigned in TREC-like IR experiments. Search tasks are carried out by informa-tion seekers as a means to gather information for the purpose to fulfill work tasks at hand. There are two types of search tasks, i.e., retrieval tasks and seeking tasks, depending on to what extent IR systems are involved during engaging in these tasks. In other words, retrieval tasks are associated with searching IR systems, but seeking tasks are associated with searching other systems, like phone or e-mail system. Work or daily-life tasks are the motivation of search tasks. This is different from Bystr X m and Hansen (2005), who view information search tasks as sub-tasks of information-seek-ing tasks, and information retrieval tasks as special cases of information search tasks associated with searching IR systems. 2.4. Summary of work task classification
This section reviewed the existing task classification schemes in organizational management, social psychology, and information science. Due to their different backgrounds, researchers have different perspectives from which to consider the issue of task classification. For example, Campbell (1988) and Bystr X m and J X rvelin (1995) define task complexity from different perspectives. The former focuses on objective task complexity, while the latter are concerned with perceived task complexity resulting from information input, processing, and use. Also, some researchers classify tasks specifically to their studies. For example, Whitley and Frost (1973) only focus on the tasks in a research laboratory; Tushman (1978) deals with tasks in R&amp;D settings; Algon (1997, 1999) classifies the tasks of a drug-development project team. In addition, some researchers investigate a certain type of task. For example, McGrath (1984) examines group tasks, and Hackman (1968) only focuses on one type of group task, i.e., intellective tasks. Bystr X m and Hansen (2002, 2005) and Xie (1998) take different ap-proaches to task classification. The former is concerned with different levels of work tasks; the latter focuses on user goals at different levels. However, they obtain similar task classification schemes which cover different levels of information-related tasks. Among these classification schemes, MacMullin and Taylor X  X  (1984) scheme is the only one which gives a relatively comprehensive classification of problems. In terms that tasks and problems have common characteristics to some extent, this scheme sheds light on task dimensions.

In sum, previous task classification schemes take a hierarchical approach based on certain criteria. Moreover, these clas-sification schemes reflect various facets of task, for example, task complexity, task goal, task topic, task structure, process, and so on. This is the starting point for us to think about a faceted classification scheme of task.

Table 6 shows these task classification schemes and their underlying facets. 3. Information-related tasks
Tasks are defined from different angles in information science. As discussed above, some researchers explore information intensive work tasks, to investigate the relationship between work tasks and information-seeking behavior. Most researchers directly focus on different types of information-related tasks, namely, information search tasks and interactive tasks (Hansen, 1999 ). Information search tasks refer to what users need to search in IR systems to support their work tasks. Inter-active task refers to the activities involved in the course of users X  interactions with systems, for example, issuing search que-ries, reviewing search results, making relevance judgments, and so on. This type of task is also viewed as interactive information searching behavior. Since the purpose of this study is to develop a classification scheme of task which is able to help researchers make predictions of information behavior,  X  X ask X  and  X  X ehavior X  are viewed as different constructs in this study. To avoid confusion of these two constructs, the present paper does not review the studies discussing the classification of interactive tasks, and their characteristics will not be taken into account in the classification developed in this study. Thus, the classification is not applicable to classifying interactive tasks. Another issue is that most current studies are concerned with classification schemes of information search tasks. Therefore, this section focuses on reviewing these studies. However, since seeking tasks and search tasks share similar attributes, the classification which is applicable to search tasks should also be applicable to seeking tasks. 3.1. Search tasks 3.1.1. Closed tasks vs. open-ended tasks
Information search tasks have drawn much attention in information science. Marchionini (1989) conducted an explor-atory study aimed at examining information-seeking strategies of novices in electronic searching environment. Two types of task, i.e., a closed task and an open-ended task, were assigned to the subjects. The former required students to locate a fact-the first year skating was introduced into the Olympic Games. The subjects were required to combine three facets, i.e., place, activity, and time. For this kind of task, there is only one correct answer. The latter required the subjects to find information about women who have traveled in space. It also asked the subjects to locate facts, but many related facts may exist. These facts should combine three facets as well, i.e., person, place, and activity.
 3.1.2. Specific tasks vs. general tasks
Qiu (1993) attempted to discover users X  search state patterns in a hypertext system. As a critical factor investigated in this were required to find general information about hypertext systems, including definition, history, and so forth. The specific task asked the subjects to locate the answers for a specific question about hypertext systems, for example,  X  X  X hat size should a node be? X  and  X  X  X hat types of links should there be? X  (p. 418). 3.1.3. Known item search tasks vs. subject search tasks
Walker and Janes (1999) pointed out that there was a usual way to characterize users X  requests, that is, to charac-terize them into Known item search and Subject search. Known item search tasks mean that the need of the user is to locate and obtain a particular document for which the author or title, or other distinguishing characteristic (e.g. red cover; bottom right shelf; saw it on Thursday) is known, while users need to locate material dealing with a partic-ular subject or to answer a particular question when engaging in subject search tasks (recently, some have taken to call-ing this type of search  X  X  X xploratory search X , cf. CACM, 2006 ). Taking these two types of search task, Kim and Allen (2000) and Kim (2001) examined the influence of cognitive style, online database search experience, and task types on the user X  X  search behavior on the Web. They pointed out that known item search tasks and subject search tasks respectively correspond to the closed and open-ended tasks of Marchionini (1989) and the specific tasks and general tasks of Qiu (1993) . Therefore, to some extent it is agreed that search tasks can be distinguished as known item search tasks and subject search tasks.

Kim (2006) attempted to investigate how search tasks as a predictable indicator affect users X  information-seeking behav-ior in the Web. She first identified task types which represent web users X  diverse information needs. She categorized search tasks as Factual tasks, Descriptive tasks, Instrumental tasks, and Exploratory tasks. Factual tasks seek for specific precise data. Descriptive tasks aim to define/describe thing, event, reason, means, and so on. Instrumental tasks find out what to do or how to do something. Exploratory tasks require generalization related to facts in meaningful patterns. It could be noted that factual tasks are similar to specific tasks mentioned above, and other three types of task are specifications of general search tasks or subject tasks.

However, whether two types or four types of search task, the aforementioned classification schemes take into account one facet of task, namely, retrieved results (i.e. task product). Also, these task classification schemes are embedded in the specific studies, and thus are tailored to the requirements of these studies.

Ingwersen and J X rvelin (2005) adapted subjective work task complexity defined by Bystr X m and J X rvelin (1995) to classifying search task. They differentiate three types of search task with different complexity levels, such as routine search task, normal search task, and genuine search task. Routine search task is the least complex one and expects a simplistic information need. With the increase of complexity, search task requires more information and the information need may be more muddled. Considering the subjective task complexity, intentionality or goal of the search task, and the quality of what is known of the information objects, they further identified eight types of information need: Known item searching for unstructured information objects by known features; Known data element searching for a priori structured (relational) information entities by other known structured data; Known topic or contents searching to clarify, review or pursue unstructured information by known keys or features; Factual data searching for informative answers (facts) by other known facts; Muddled item searching for full information objects by insufficient knowledge; Muddled data element searching for relational data entities or structures by vague or ill-defined data features; Muddled topic or contents searching to explore cognitive-emotional contents or subjects matter in novel information environment by ill-defined domain/work task; Muddled factual searching for informative answers to content-related or topical questions by ill-defined unstructured conceptual features (p. 292). Information need types may change with the information seek-ing and retrieval process. It is noted that the first four information needs are more specific, while the latter four are more exploratory. 3.1.4. Internally generated tasks vs. externally generated tasks In order to develop a task-oriented framework for the IR process based on the concept of a task-oriented test collection, Reid (2000) took a different approach to classifying search tasks. She argued that even though there was a huge variety of IR task, some common features across all tasks exist. She characterized IR tasks into internally generated tasks and externally generated tasks. Task performer is the same person with task setter for internally generated tasks, whereas tasks are as-signed to task performer by task setter for externally generated tasks. According to her, task types could be based on different dimensions, for example, tasks generated by domain experts/novices, tasks generated by externally/internally, and simple (well-defined)/complex (poorly-defined) tasks. It is noted that she defines simple/complex task from another perspective in contrast to the previous discussion about task complexity.

Similarly, the imposed query model (Gross, 1995 ) distinguishes self-generated questions from imposed questions in the information seeking process. The former refers to questions  X  X  X nternally motivated by personal context X  ( Gross, 2001, p. 2; ), in other words, these questions are users X  own questions. The latter refers to those questions  X  X  X hought up by one person then given to someone else to resolve X  (Gross, 2001, p. 2), namely, questions from other people. This model suggests two different types of search task, i.e., self-generated tasks and imposed search tasks.
 3.1.5. Pragmatic dimension vs. semantic dimension vs. syntactic dimension query-based taxonomy of user tasks. They found that users brought a large set of tasks ranging from locating  X  X  X  specific sta-tistic X  to  X  X  X nfocussed interest in large topical areas X  (p. 307). In order to categorize these tasks, they took a linguistic ap-proach which led to a very different search task classification than aforementioned ones. From the perspective of linguistics, an expression is made up of a topical or semantic component, a pragmatic component (the situational or contex-tual aspects), and a syntactic component (how the expression is phrased.) Therefore, the taxonomy of tasks in this study in-volves three dimensions: Pragmatic dimension (context/situation), Semantic dimension, and Syntactic dimension. The whole taxonomy (pp. 307 X 308) is shown in Table 7 .
 tasks in multiple systems. This taxonomy is expected to be a framework for promoting user interface design. However, even if the authors have realized the insufficiency of characterizing tasks from single dimension and the necessity of providing a multiple-dimension classification system of tasks, this taxonomy merely takes account of three dimensions of expressions from linguistic perspective, and the three dimensions may not be able to cover all relevant facets of tasks. 3.2. Summary of information search task classification involve known item search and subject search, and many studies in information science adopt this scheme or similar ones.
This classification scheme takes into account the characteristics of the product of information search. In addition, more facets are considered in Ingwersen and J X rvelin (2005) , such as subjective task complexity and intentionality or goal of search task.
In Reid X  X  (2000) classification, source of task, that is, where tasks are from, is considered. Among these search task classifi-cation schemes, Hert and Marchionini X  X  (1998) query-based taxonomy of task is a particular one in that it is based on the usage of the statistical websites and identifies facets of a task from the linguistic perspective. It is expected to improve inter-face design as well as attempts to connect user studies and systems design.
 ever, like the current classification schemes of work tasks, these classification systems only focus on one or a few facets of task, for example, task complexity, interaction, user goal, and so on. These studies based on a single facet to conceptualizing tasks may only reveal the influence of one aspect of tasks on information search behavior. Thus, the effects of other facets, especially the combined effects of different facets of task, on such behavior may be ignored. As a result, these studies are unable to provide a way to comprehensively understand information search behavior. More important, there is still not a comprehensive task classification scheme that can be used to categorize work tasks and search tasks. Therefore, we try to integrate the previously identified (though individually limited) characteristics of tasks at all levels into a single classifica-tion, so as to facilitate the exploration of the relationship between tasks and information-seeking behavior. 4. A faceted classification of task
As discussed above, most of the existing classification schemes are developed based on one or a few facets of tasks, such as Process, Goal, Source of task, and some task attributes. However, these classification schemes just partially reflect the characteristics of tasks. As a consequence, they can neither provide a way to conceptualize tasks from a holistic view, nor support the investigation of the relationship among work tasks, information search tasks, and information-seeking behavior well. Thus, it is necessary to take various facets of task into account when classifying tasks. This section further analyzes task facets to develop a faceted classification of task. 4.1. Task facets
Task facets are defined as different aspects, properties or characteristics of tasks. We have discussed some facets of task based on the review above. The most frequently used facets to classify tasks include Source of task, Product, Goal, Content, Process, Objective and Perceived task complexity, and Task difficulty. This section further discusses the facets of task.
Wood (1986) also addressed the facet issue of tasks. According to him, there are three essential components of tasks, namely, Products, Acts, and Information cues. Products refer to the entities created or produced after task completion. Acts refer to the actions for the creation of a defined product. Information cues are pieces of information about the attributes of stimulus object. These cues support task doers in making judgments during task performance. Act and Information cues are input for task performance, while Product is the output when tasks are completed. The three components in fact reflect three facets of task: Process, Attribute, and Product. However, for some tasks there are no physical products produced after task completion. Therefore, Product as a facet of tasks should refer to the outcomes or results of task completion.
Moreover, tasks here are defined as a motivation of information seeking and search. A task should involve the following aspects: (1) Where is this task from? (2) Who carries it out? (3) How long does this task last? (4) What is it about (topic or content)? (5) How should this task be completed? (6) What is (are) its product(s)? and (7) What is (are) its goal(s)? These aspects represent the different facets of a task, as identified by our integrated summary of previous research on the signif-icant characteristics of task. However, topic of tasks is an unlimited list and assigning limited values to it is impossible. Therefore, topic of task is not considered as a facet in our proposed faceted classification. Nevertheless, it still could be re-flected in the other facets, for example, frequency of task execution and knowledge of task.
 After further categorizing the aforementioned facets, a task involves the following facets: Source of task, Task doer, Time, Process, Product, and Goal. They are labeled  X  X eneric facets of task X  since they describe external characteristics of tasks. All tasks can be classified based on these facets.
 In addition, based on our review, internal features of a task, i.e., task attributes are indispensable for describing a task. Hansen (1999) has provided a comprehensive list of task characteristics based on a literature review. However, the facets in a faceted classification should be mutually exclusive. Therefore, we will take the following task attributes into account: task complexity (subjective and objective), task difficulty, task interdependence, degree of structure of task, salience of task, degree of urgency of task, and knowledge of task. We label these attributes  X  X ommon attributes of task X  because each type of task classified based on  X  X eneric facets of task X  can be described by all of these attributes. Furthermore, since some attributes reflect the characteristics of the task itself, such as objective task complexity, task interdependence, and degree of structure of task, and others are related to users X  perceptions, we group them into  X  X  X ask characteristics X  and  X  X  X ser X  X  perception of task X , respectively. 4.2. The detailed classification of task
Based on the above analysis and our review of previous studies, we can further identify the sub-facets and their values, by which a faceted classification scheme of task is established. Table 9 shows this faceted classification scheme, including cat-egories, facets, sub-facets, values, and operational definitions. This classification scheme has been empirically investigated. Based on that empirical study, the facets, sub-facets, and values were defined and the facets were found to be mutually exclusive. The results and findings of this empirical study will be reported in a separate paper.

This classification is aimed at identifying different aspects of task, and thus we can use it to describe different tasks. For example, a simulated work task states: A researcher will do a proposal for a project on designing a task-based collaborative information retrieval (CIR) system in order to apply for a grant, which is important for his research and the deadline is grant applications from time to time) , and short-term task (only half month to complete) at the beginning stage ; it will produce repeatedly revise the proposal. In terms of its attributes, it is a moderate complexity task (not involving significantly more paths) with low interdependence (not depending on other people to complete this proposal) . This task may be high salience (being related to his future career) for this researcher; it may be an immediate (deadline is approaching) task, high difficulty (writing a proposal for grant is not easy) and neutral in subjective complexity (not feeling too complex) . Moreover, because he knows how to write a proposal, he has high knowledge of task procedure (knowing well how to write a proposal) and moderate knowledge of task topic (having some knowledge but needing further exploration) . From this example, it can be seen that this work task could be described comprehensively. The characteristics of this task itself as well as how the task doer perceives this task could also be known well. Both of them may be important factors influencing the person X  X  information seeking and search behavior.

The search task of this work task can be described as follows: it is an individual-based and internal-generated task (by this person) ;itisan individual (no collaboration) , intermittent (searching for grant applications from time to time) , and short-term task (not taking too long time) ; it is a task with a specific goal (searching relevant and useful information regarding task-based systems and CIR systems to support the completion of the proposal) and multi-goal (searching for different topics and information items) . The researcher has to search for relevant information ( intellectual products ) and be multi-time process ( searching sev-eral times for gathering needed information ) during information searching. In terms of task attributes, it is a high complexity task (consulting different information sources) to the researcher with low interdependence (not needing any people X  X  help) . Deter-mined by the attributes of the work task, the search task is high salient (information is highly important for this person to com-plete the proposal) and immediate (deadline for the proposal is approaching) . Based on the researcher X  X  knowledge level in information searching, search experience, familiarity with the topic, and so on, s/he may feel that s/he is of low knowledge of task procedure in performing this search task (not engaging in this type of search previously) and moderate knowledge of task topic (having some knowledge but further exploration is needed) . The search task may be difficult to do (not knowing how to do) and complex (the person may feel the search is complex) . This example also shows that the classification scheme can work well in describing a search task.

This faceted classification scheme reflects the features of tasks, and provides a way to describe work tasks, information search tasks, and the searcher X  X  perception of tasks. Therefore, it is expected that this faceted classification scheme can enhance our capability of examining the relationships between work tasks, information search tasks, and information seek-ing and search behavior. 5. Conclusion are usually limited to the specific studies, and researchers classify tasks on the basis of one or a few task dimensions. Though
McGrath (1984) provides a taxonomy of tasks that is accepted by people in group and organizational research, in terms of a classification of task which can facilitate support for information-seeking behavior, an applicable task classification is still lacking. This is a barrier to comprehensively investigate the effects of tasks on information-seeking behavior and understand the relationships between tasks and users X  interaction with IR systems. Considering these insufficiencies, this study developed a faceted classification of task through reviewing related studies on task classification in several disciplines. Here, tasks are regarded as a multi-faceted event with various characteristics, including those related to a task itself as well as users X  percep-

 as a multi-faceted variable. This view could help understand the effects of tasks on information searching behavior more comprehensively than only viewing tasks from one aspect. It is helpful to probe their relationships and users X  interactive information searching behavior by examining each facet X  X  function during the interaction. Specifically, it could help explore the following types of research questions: behavior, and thus provide a chance to identify the behaviors which indicate task characteristics. By monitoring users X  behavior, IR systems may offer corresponding support to adapt to the requirements of users X  tasks and assist them to com-plete their tasks.
 convenient way to investigate the relationships between them, especially between work tasks and seeking tasks, and be-tween work tasks and search tasks. That is, their relationships could be revealed through investigating the relationships be-tween their facets. The articulation of their relationships is a basis to predict seeking tasks and search tasks through work tasks. Work task seems a variable which is more stable and more possible to be known compared to seeking tasks and search tasks, since in an organization people X  X  work tasks are usually explicit. If the characteristics of search tasks could be known through the examination of the characteristics of work tasks, IR systems may be designed to adapt to users X  search tasks and assist them to complete the tasks more effectively.

 between tasks and interactive information-seeking behavior, and thereby to provide a basis for personalization and contex-tualization of IR interaction based upon the searcher X  X  work and search tasks.
