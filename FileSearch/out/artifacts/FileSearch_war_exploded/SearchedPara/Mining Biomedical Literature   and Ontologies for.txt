 Drug development is time-consuming, costly, and risky. The development process to bring a new drug to market requires about 10-15 years and costs between 500 million ported, 80 to 90 percent of drug development projects fail before they ever get tested pharmaceutical companies have been evaluating alternative paradigms for drug de-velopment, e.g., drug repositioning. The goal of drug repositioning is to find new indications (i.e., treatment for diseases) for existing drugs. Because existing drugs already have their preclinical properties and established safety profiles, many experi-ments, analyses and tests can therefore be bypassed [3]. Thus, drug repositioning can drug repositioning helps a company exploit its intellectual property portfolio by extending its old or expiring patents, or getting new method-of-use patents [3]. 
One notable example of repositioned drug is Thalidomide. It was originally mar-keted as a sedative and antiemetic for pregnant women to treat morning sickness, but was completely withdrawn from the market after the drug was found responsible for severe birth defects [4]. After Celgene Corporation X  X  repositioning works, FDA approved Thalidomide for use in the treatment of Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) in 1998 [5]. The company further discovered that Thalidomide is also effective against several other diseases, including multiple myeloma. Accordingly, Celgene gets several utility patents for the repositioned Thalidomide, and it brings in over 300 million U.S. dollars in revenue annually since 2004 [6-8]. 
Several computational drug repositioning approaches have been developed to help medical researchers sift the most plausible drug-disease pairs from a wide range of combinations. Dudley et al. [9] summarized several computational drug repositioning methods and categorized them as either drug-based, where discovery from the chemi-cal or pharmaceutical perspective, or disease-based, where discovery from the pers-pective of disease management, symptomatology, or pathology. Another excellent review in [10] highlights computational techniques for systematic analysis of tran-indications. Several network based approaches use various heterogeneous data re-sources to discovery drug repositioning opportunity [11, 12]. Moreover, Wu et al. [13] summarized 26 different sources of databases related to disease, genes, proteins, and drugs for drug repositioning. In summary, existing drug-repositioning methods can broadly be classified into two approaches: literature-based and ontology-based . The literature-based approach assumes that if a drug frequently co-occurs with some biomedical concepts (such as enzymes, gene s, pathological effects, and proteins) and many of these concepts also frequently co-occur with a disease in biomedical litera-knowledge bases) to discover hidden relationships between drugs and diseases. These existing methods have shown their feasibility for drug repositioning. However, most existing methods rely only on single information source, i.e., literature or ontologies. 
In this study, we propose a drug repositioning method that exploits multiple information sources to discover hidden relationships between drugs and diseases. Spe-cifically, a comprehensive network of biomedical concepts is first constructed by com-bining and integrating relations of biomedical concepts extracted from literature and existing ontologies. Subsequently, we follow Swanson X  X  ABC model [14] to obtain diseases ( C s) from the comprehensive concept network. A novel link weighting me-proposed method, we collect the literature from MEDLINE and three ontologies (i.e., DrugBank [15], Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [16], and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) [17]), and follow the evaluation procedure proposed sults, our proposed method outperforms the existing method for drug repositioning. motivation. In Section 3, we describe the design of our proposed drug repositioning discovery method. Section 4 reports on our evaluation of our proposed method. Finally, we conclude our study in Section 5. In this section, we review existing drug repositioning methods, which can be classi-fied into two major approaches: literature-based and ontology-based. 2.1 Literature-Based Approach Swanson [19] first introduced the idea of discovering hidden relationships from bio-medical literatures in the mid-1980s. He examined across disjoint literatures, manual-ly identified plausible new connections, and found fish oil might be beneficial to the treatment of Raynaud X  X  syndrome [19]. Furthermore, Swanson and Smalheiser devel-oped a computational model, namely  X  ABC model  X  or  X  undiscovered public know-ledge ( UPK ) model  X  [14]. The basic assumption of ABC model is that if a biomedical another concept C , there is a logically plausible relation between A and C . The ABC model generally consists of three major phases: term selection to extract textual terms discovery. 
Weeber et al. [20] followed Swanson X  X  idea of co-occurrence analysis and mapped words from titles and abstracts extracted from MEDLINE articles to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts to filter link candidates with the help of semantic information. Similarly, Wren et al. [21] mapped full text from articles into OMIM concepts. They measured link weights between concepts by mutual information. Lee et al. [22] further combined multiple thesauruses to better translate text into biomedi-cal concepts. These studies employed the full text for concept extraction with the help of thesauri. On the other hand, some othe r studies used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) as keywords to annotate each article in MEDLINE [18] [23-24]. They ap-them reported the metadata-only approach is feasible, though Hristovski et al. [24] noted some shortcoming of using MeSH such as insufficient information of involving genes. Based on the ABC model, several drug repositioning methods [20-21] [25-26] were proposed to find undiscovered relations between drugs and diseases through selecting different semantic groups of intermediate terms such as adverse effects, genes, and proteins. 
For evaluating the performance of the literature-based approach, Yetisgen-Yildiz and Pratt [18] developed an evaluation methodology. They used two literature sets predict novel relations in the newer set. They compared the effectiveness of various link weighting methods. According to their study, association rule appears to achieve the best performance over tf-idf, mutual information measure, and z-score. They also compared different target term ranking algorithms and suggested that the use of link term count with average minimum weight can achieve the best effectiveness. 2.2 Ontology-Based Approach Campillos et al. [27] constructed a network of side-effect driven drug-drug relations from UMLS ontology by measuring side-effect similarity between drugs. Assuming can be used to predict new drug-target interactions. They also experimentally vali-dated their results, and thus reported the feasibility of using phenotypic information to infer unexpected biomedical relations. Yang and Agarwal [28] also based on side effect likelihood between drugs, but they constructed Na X ve Bayes models to make predictions. They took PharmGKB and SIDER knowledge bases, rather than pheno-type database, as their information sources. Cheng et al. [29] built a bipartite network by extracting known drug-target interaction data from DrugBank, and used the net-work similarity to predict new targets of drugs. Li and Lu [30] built a network similar sideration. 
Qu et al. [31] and Lee et al. [26] both attempted to increase the size and scope of semantic data by constructing integrated network or database of ontologies. However, into account, which may be a good way to acquire deeper and broader biomedical knowledge for making predictions of drug-disease relations. Li et al. [32] tried to incorporate more knowledge by using protein-protein interactions extracted from Online Predicted Human Interaction Database (OPHID) to expand disease-related proteins, and built disease-specific drug-protein connectivity maps based on literature mining. His work inspires us to build a network over multiple information sources. We propose a drug repositioning discovery method that is based on Swanson X  X  ABC Fig. 1 illustrates our proposed method, which consists of four main phases: compre-target term ranking . 3.1 Phase 1: Comprehensive Concept Network Construction biomedical literature and an ontology-based concept network from existing ontologies (i.e., DrugBank, OMIM, and CTD in this study) and, subsequently, integrate them into a comprehensive concept network. 
For the literature-based concept network construction, we collect the biomedical li-terature from MEDLINE 2011 baseline. U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexes the publication type for each artic le. We follow Yetisgen-Yildiz X  X  preprocess-ing procedure [18] to remove 18 irrelevant types (e.g., address, bibliography, com-ment, etc.) from the 61 publication types in MEDLINE 2011 baseline. NLM also indexes several MeSH terms for each biomedical article. As a result, our literature database consists of 18,712,338 biomedical articles. The number of MeSH terms per article ranges from 1 to 97, and its average is 9.44. We further select several MeSH subcategories related to drug repositioning, as shown in Table 1. Next, association rule mining is applied on the collected literature where biomedical articles and MeSH terms are considered as tr ansactions and items, respectively. We follow Yetisgen-Yildiz and Pratt X  X  experiment [18] by setting the minimum support threshold to 2.6 and the minimum confidence threshold to 0.0055 in this study. After filtering, we extract 12,278 MeSH terms and 2,623,222 relations to construct a literature-based concept network. 
For the ontology-based concept network construction, the ontologies we use in this study include DrugBank [15], OMIM [16], and CTD [17]. DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca/) is a richly annotated database which provides extensive information about targets, pathways, indications, adverse effects, and related proteins of various drugs, whereas OMIM (http://www.omim.org/) is a comprehensive and authoritative knowledge base of human genes and genetic phenotypes. CTD scribe chemical interactions with genes and proteins, and diseases and genes/proteins, and others. The collected information includ es various types of relations, such as drug-target, gene-disease, gene-gene, protein-protein, chemical-gene, gene-disease relations, etc. And, we also try to translate those terms to MeSH term and select only MeSH subcategories shown in Table 1. The summary of these collected ontology-based relations is shown in Table 2. 3.2 Phase 2: Related Concept Retrieval Given a user-specified focal drug, the goal of this phase is to retrieve related relations from the comprehensive concept network and to construct a subgraph for the focal drug in the network as intermediate terms. These intermediate terms may be gene, protein, disease, etc. Then, we extract the disease concepts that related to these inter-mediate terms but not related to the given drug. 3.3 Phase 3: Link Weighting Given the extracted subgraph for the user-specified drug, the goal of this phase is to weight each link in the subgraph according to different weighting strategies for litera-ture-based links and ontology-based links. We propose a link weighting method, namely Extended Normalized MEDLINE Similarity (ExtNMS), based on the Norma-lized Google Distance (NGD) [33] to calculate similarity between MeSH term A and B as follows: where D A is the set of articles including MeSH term A , and M denotes the total num-ber of articles in MEDLINE. This weighting measure ranges from 0 to 1, in which 0 being completely unrelated and 1 being credibly related. If link ( A , B ) is from the lite-rature-based concept network and is not found in the ontology-based concept net-work, we weight it by calculating its Normalized MEDLINE Distance (NMD) and subtracting from 1, called Normalized MEDLINE Similarity (NMS); otherwise, if the this relation should have been validated. 3.4 Phase 4: Target Term Ranking Yetisgen-Yildiz &amp; Pratt [18] suggested that using Link Term Count with Average Minimum Weight (LTC-AMW) can achieve the best effectiveness for target term ranking. LTC-AMW takes the number of intermediate terms between starting term and target term as the primary ranking criteria, i.e. the number of paths. The average number of paths. In this study, we propose two target term ranking measures, Summa-tion of Minimum Weight (SumMW) and Summation of Average Weight (SumAW), as follows: link between term A and B . The above measures differentiate the importance of each path according to their minimum or average weight of constituent links, and assign an paths between the starting term and the target term. We then order target terms ac-cording to their importance scores. In this study, we conduct two experiments to evaluate our proposed method for drug repositioning. The first experiment is to evaluate our proposed comprehensive con-cept network and link weighting measure (i.e., ExtNMS). The second experiment is to evaluate our proposed target term ranking measure. 4.1 Evaluation Design We follow the evaluation procedure proposed by Yetisgen-Yildiz and Pratt [18]. Spe-cifically, we describe our experiment procedure step by step in the following. 
Given a starting term A (i.e., drug): 1. We set cut-off date as January 1, 2000 and divide MEDLINE 2011 baseline into two datasets: (a) Pre-cut-off set ( S t 1 ) includes the documents prior to 1/1/2000. (b) Post-cut-off set ( S t 2 ) includes the documents on and after 1/1/2000. 2. The documents in the pre-cut-off set are used along with ontologies as the input to construct the comprehensive concept network. rules: (a) Terms are within our specified target semantic group, i.e., disease. (b) Terms co-occur with term A in the post-cut-off set, but do not co-occur with (c) Terms are not related to term A in the ontology-based concept network. 4. The discovery effectiveness is estimated by using the information retrieval metrics as follows: (a) Precision: (b) Recall: where T A is the set of target terms generated by our discovery method. we randomly select 100 terms from the semantic group of drugs as the starting terms, i.e., the focal drugs. 4.2 Exp. 1: Evaluation of the Comprehensive Concept Network and Link The performance benchmark is the original ABC model over only the literature which uses association rules as link weighting algorithm [14]. We evaluate three versions of over the comprehensive concept network. All methods (including the benchmark) under investigation apply LTC-AMW as the target term ranking measure. Table 4 shows the evaluation results, and the Area Under Curve of Precision and Recall (AUC-PR) represents the overall performance. A higher AUC-PR value represents a greater effectiveness. As Table 4 illustrates, our proposed ExtNMS measure outper-forms the benchmark link weighting measure (i.e., association rules) when the infor-comprehensive concept network that contains literature and ontologies). Moreover, using both literature and ontologies as information sources improves the overall per-formance, especially precisions on higher ranks. This would better help researchers sift plausible drug-disease relations for the purpose of drug repositioning. 4.3 Exp. 2: Evaluation of Target Term Ranking Measure In this experiment, we evaluate the proposed target term ranking measures, Summa-tion of Minimum Weight (SumMW) and Summation of Average Weight (SumAW). Based on the experiment 1, we apply ExtNMS as the link weighting measure in this experiment. In this experiment, LTC-AMW is used as the benchmark ranking meas-ure. Table 8 shows the comparative evaluation results of the three target term ranking measures using the comprehensive concept network as the information sources. Both SumMW and SumAW outperform the benchmark measure, LTC-AMW. These re-sults show that our link weighting measure, ExtNMS, is a more effective measure to weight links, and considering both the number and weights of paths between the start-ing term and target terms can improve the discovery effectiveness. In this study, we develop a drug repositioning discovery method that uses both bio-medical literature and ontologies as information sources for constructing a compre-hensive network of biomedical concepts. We also develop a link weighting method (i.e., ExtNMS) and two target term ranking measures. We experimentally evaluate our proposed method and show that taking both literature and ontologies into account and using our ExtNMS measure can improve the effectiveness of predicting novel drug-disease relationships. Besides, our proposed target term ranking measures can better infer plausible drug-disease relations. Overall, our proposed drug repositioning dis-covery method can help researchers sift most plausible unknown drug-disease rela-tionships, i.e., potential drug repositioning candidates.
