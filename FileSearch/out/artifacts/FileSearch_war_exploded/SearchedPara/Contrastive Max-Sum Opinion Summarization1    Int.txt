 As the world wide web is becomin g a more reliable and more easily available so u rce of information people comment on prod u cts the had p u rchased, movies and locations they had seen, or they read the reviews s u ch as these before they b u y somethin g . Today, a very bi g amo u nt of opinionated text is available for the u sers. However, findin g o u tthe pros and cons of a prod u ct itself or a specific aspect of it is not trivial witho u thavin g to read all the reviews to have an idea. A system which can extract positive and ne g ative opinions on different aspects of a prod u ct and compare them is necessary.

Extraction of comparative sentences with contrastin g opinions is a recently proposed problem in the literat u re. Kim and Zhai proposed this problem and named it as co n -tr a sti v e opi n io n s umma riz a tio n (CO S ) in [8] . In this st u dy, the opinion labels of the sentences are g iven beforehand, and the system tries to select the most representative and comparable sentences accordin g ly.
 In this paper, a new COS al g orithm is proposed and eval u ated. A new dataset in T u rkish is created and the eval u ation res u lts for this new dataset are presented here. O u r contrib u tions are as follows: (1) A new al g orithm, namely Contrastive Max-S u m Opinion S u mmarization (CMSOS), which extracts t he most representative and com-parable opinionated text in parallel. This al g orithm g ives better res u lts on the dataset of [8] than the ones they report. (2) To o u r knowled g e, there is no p u blicly available dataset in T u rkish that g ives aspects of items and opinion of u sers on these items. We created a new dataset that contains reviews and ratin g softhe u sers on movies and as-pects that exists in the reviews 1 . (3) We also report the res u lts of applyin g CMSOS to the newly created T u rkish dataset in this paper. We conject u re that these res u lts will aid in providin g preliminary res u lts for f u rther st u dies.

In Section 2, information on related work is g iven. In Section 3, the proposed al g o-rithm, namely Contrastive Max-S u m Opinion S u mmarization (CMSOS), is explained. In Sections 4 and 5 information on the datasets and eval u ation res u lts are g iven. Finally, Section 6 g ives the concl u sion. Opinion s u mmarization techniq u es aim to find topics and cla ssify the opinion attached to the topics. They sometimes do this takin g into acco u nt different aspects of the topic in q u estion. [4], [10], [12] are the representative works on opinion s u mmarization, that apply data minin g and he u ristic methods. He u ristics u sed by these methods vary from word freq u encies and no u n phrase statistics to information from WordNet. However, these methods do not extract comparative sentences and/or doc u ments.
 There are st u dies that aim to collect co mparative sentences, s u ch as [5], [11], [15]. They detect contradiction in text and/or detect comparative sentences in the doc u ments. They take several different approaches, s u ch as searchin g words in the doc u ments s u ch as  X  X han X  [5], binary classification methods s u ch as SVM [15] and g raph representation based methods [11]. Altho ug h these methods aim to extract the comparative sentences, they do not aim to find the most representative ch u nks of text or comparative s u mmaries.
Contrastive opinion s u mmarization (COS) methods aim to collect not only the most representative sentences b u t also the contrastive ones from the inp u t. This problem is introd u ced in the literat u re by [8]. They define COS as follows:  X  X iven two sets of positively and ne g atively opinionated sentences which are often the o u tp u tofanexist-in g opinion s u mmarizer, COS aims to extract comp arable sentences from each set of opinions and g enerate a comparative s u mmary containin g a set of contrastive sentence pairs. X  They form u late the problem as an optimization problem and propose two meth-ods each of which foc u ses on these two iss u es  X  X epresentativeness and contrastiveness X  in different orders, namely Representativene ss First (RF) or Contrastiveness First (CF).
In RF approach, firstly, the inp u t positive and ne g ative sentence sets ( X and Y re-spectively) are divided into s u b-cl u sters u sin g the representativeness meas u re. Then, the sentences from each cl u ster in X and Y are ali g ned u sin g the representativeness and contrastiveness meas u res to g ether. Even if m u ltiple sentences in the same cl u ster have hi g h scores, this approach collects a sin g le sentence from each cl u ster. In CF ap-proach,the contrastiveness of the sentences in X and Y are calc u lated first. After that, the pair with the hi g hest contrastiveness is chosen as the first pair of the comparative s u mmary. The other pairs are selected dependin g on the previo u sly chosen pairs and representativeness and contrastiveness metrics. In this approach, if the first pair is not the optimal choice, the q u ality of the o u tp u t comparative s u mmary will be lower. P a u l et a l. (2010) also aim to create contrastive s u mmaries from the inp u tsetin[13]. They perform a two-sta g e approach. In the first step they extract m u ltiple viewpoints from the text, and in the second sta g e they collect both representative and contrastive sentences. For the second sta g e, they propose Comparative LexRank method, which is based on random walk.

Lerman and McDonald (2009) also name their problem as contrastive s u mmarization in [9]. However, their sol u tion is different than the previo u s approaches. While previ-o u sst u dies aim to extract differ ent viewpoints of a sin g le prod u ct/aspect, this work aims to g enerate two different s u mmaries on a pair of prod u cts. With this approach, the s u mmaries hi g hli g ht the differences of the prod u cts. [14] foc u ses on constr u ctin g short and comparative s u mmaries of prod u ct reviews. Unlike COS methods, they aim to compare two selected prod u cts. They prod u ce ali g ned pairs of sentences related to prod u cts on different aspects. The aspects are also selected a u tomatically by their method.

The literat u re related to opinion s u mmarization in T u rkish is limited as a res u lt of the lack of datasets p u blicly available. Sentiment and/or emotion analysis can be considered as related to opinion s u mmarization. The few works foc u sed on sentiment and emotion analysis in T u rkish belon g to [1,2], [7]. None of these works foc u s on different aspects of the items and compare the sentiment res u lts on aspects. A very recent work cond u cted by [6] provides res u lts for feat u re based s u mmarization of prod u ct reviews in T u rkish. This st u dy foc u ses on prod u cin g personalized review s u mmaries on m u ltiple prod u cts. Unlike o u r work, they do not ret u rn a list of comparative sentences on different aspects of a sin g le prod u ct. They cond u ct their eval u ation on a T u rkish dataset that they created. Unfort u nately, the dataset is not available p u blicly, to o u r knowled g e. Traditional opinion s u mmarization techniq u es aim to select a set of the most representa-tive opinionated text from an inp u t set. Unlike them, contrastive opinion s u mmarization (COS) methods aim to collect not only the most representative sentences b u talsothe ones that have contrastive meanin g . This helps u sers to become aware of the different opinions on different aspects of a chosen item/topic in order to have a better idea by makin gu se of the created comparative s u mmaries.
 In this paper, we propose a COS method, namely Contrastive Max-S u m Opinion S u mmarization (CMSOS). The method creates a list of pairs of the most representative sentences related to a g iven aspect. Each pair contains a positive sentence and a ne g ative sentence, that have contrastive meanin g . For instance, ass u me that a u ser wants to find o u twhatother u sers think abo u t the desi g n of a certain prod u ct. The system ret u rns the pair of sentences  X  X t did an aw eso m ejob w it h t h edesi gn . X  as a positive sentence and  X  X  u t my bi gg est g ripe is still t h eextre m el yug l y desi gn . X  as a ne g ative one 2 . Contrastive Max-S u m Opinion S u mmarization (CMSOS) is adopted from Max-S u m Diversification method proposed in [3]. This al g orithm is proposed as a sol u tion to web-search and aims g et the most relevant and novel doc u ment from the inp u tset.In CMSOS, o u r aim is to g et most representative and contrastive sentences. We u sed doc-u ment similarity between sentences with the same labels (content similarity) to find o u t the representative sentences and doc u ment similarity between sentences with different labels (contrastive similarity) to find o u t the contrastive sentences.

The eq u ation of CMSOS is written as in Eq u ation 1. In the eq u ation, S is the sentence set, u and v are the sentences in this set, w ( u ) is the representativeness of the sentence u , d( u , v ) represents the contrast between sentences u and v ,and  X  is the parameter u sed for settin g the trade-off between relevance and similarity. The aim is to maximize f( S ) in Eq u ation 1.
We calc u late w ( u ) u sin g cosine similarity, Eq u ation 2, which s u ms the similarity of the sentences to the other se ntences and normalizes the res u lt. We apply two different approaches to decide the cosine similarity. The first one is based on word freq u encies. In Eq u ation 3, W( u , v ) contains the common words in the sentences u and v .The tf( u ,i) represents the freq u ency of the word i in the sentence u . The second meas u rement is basedontf-idfval u es of the words in the sentence as shown in Eq u ation 4. The only difference from the first version is that here we u se the tf-idf val u es. Tf-idf is u sed commonly in information retrieval and text minin g to reflect the importance of the word. The tf-idf val u e increases as the freq u ency of the word in the inp u tsentenceishi g h while the freq u ency of the word in the inp u t dataset is low. We calc u lated the tf and the idf val u es u sin g the inp u t data. We observe that the inp u t datasets contain repetitive sentences, so we applied the tf-idf version to observe the effect of these sentences on the performance.
In order to meas u re contrastive similarity we first remove the adjectives, that create the contrast. After the removal of adjectives , the cosine similarity between the sentences with different labels are calc u lated. The idea of the removal of sentiment related words is proposed in [8] in which sentiment related words are defined as ne g ation words and adjectives. In T u rkish, the ne g ation is u s u ally constr u cted by attachin g the ne g ation s u ffix to a verb or u sin g the ne g ation particle. In order to find o u t if a verb is in the ne g ative form, one needs to apply morpholo g ical analysis. In this st u dy, we did not apply any morpholo g ical analysis and considered it as a f u t u re work. 4.1 Metrics We u se precision and aspect covera g easeval u ation metrics, as s ugg ested by [8]. Kim and Zhai in [8] explain that precision repr esents the contrastiveness of the sentence pairs and the aspect covera g e indicates the representativeness of the s u mmary. In all the calc u lations the responses of each h u man labeler are analysed separately before reportin g the avera g eval u e for the overall res u lt. For some of the prod u cts, the h u man labelers labeled the sentences with differ ent aspects (some aspects are not common). The u ncommon aspects are combined u nder a new aspect with the name  X  X ther X .

The precision is calc u lated by u sin g Eq u ation 5. In this eq u ation, # ag reed Pa irs is the n u mber of times the fo u nd pairs and the h u man labels match and k is the total n u mber of selected pairs. The k val u e is calc u lated by Eq u ation 6, where | X | and | Y | are the n u mber of positive or ne g ative labeled sentences.

The aspect covera g e is calc u lated by Eq u ation 7. In this eq u ation, the n u mber of u niq u e aspects collected in the s u mmary is divided by the n u mber of u niq u e aspects labeled by h u man labelers.
 4.2 Datasets For eval u ation, two datasets will be u sed: The dataset provided in [8] 3 for En g lish, and the newly created T u rkish dataset 4 . In the followin g s u bsections, information on these datasets are g iven.
 English Dataset. The En g lish dataset [8] contains reviews on 13 different &lt; prod u ct, aspect &gt; sets, 12 of which are collected from Amazon website and 1 of which is a non-prod u ct-review text and is abo u t aspartame. In the dataset, the sentences and their polar-ities are man u ally labeled by two h u man labelers. Additionally, a non-prod u ct-review is incl u ded to show the g enerality of their method. For this p u rpose they collected 50 positiveand50ne g ative sentences abo u tAspartame u sin g Yahoo! search en g ine. The n u mber of positive and ne g ative sentences for each &lt; prod u ct, aspect &gt; t u ple is g iven in Ta b l e 1 . Turkish Dataset. To o u r knowled g e, there is no p u blicly available dataset in T u rkish with explicit information on the aspects of items, and the opinions and ratin g sof u sers on these items. We created a new dataset that contains reviews and ratin g softhe u sers on movies and on specific aspects of each movie that exist in the reviews.

Firstly, we collected the reviews and ratin g softhe u sers for the movies from a web-site, namely beyazperde 5 . On this website, u sers are asked to write reviews for movies and rate them in the ran g e [1,5] with increments of 0.5. We considered the reviews with 3.5 or more points as positive and the rest as ne g ative. We q u eried 1000 pa g es and collected only 107 of them since only these contain any review information.

Secondly, we asked two h u man labelers to label the reviews in terms of aspects. We created a form for the labelers with six dif ferent aspects; namely scenario, actin g ,m u sic, vis u als, director and g eneral. The labelers are also allowed to write down their own aspects if they find any si g nificant ones. Each labeler is assi g ned to different movies, so that the reviews of each movie are labeled by a sin g le labeler. We co u ld not u se m u ltiple labelers for each movie, since the time and the n u mber of the labelers were limited.
Lastly, we removed movies whose positive or ne g ative sentence co u nts were less than k , g iven in Eq u ation 6. At the end, we obtained 31 movies with aspects, reviews and ratin g sinT u rkish. The n u mbers of positive and ne g ative sentences for each movie in this dataset are g iven in Table 2.

We share this dataset on o u r web-site and we conject u re that this new dataset will be u sef u l to many researchers who needs data that contains aspect, ratin g and/or review information in T u rkish. We report res u lts for cosine similarity and tf-idf u sa g e on precision and aspect covera g e metrics for both datasets. In Eq u ation 1,  X  is u sed for settin g the trade-off between relevance and contrast, s u ch that lar g er  X  g ives more importance to contrastiveness. In the experiments  X  is set between 0 and 1 with 0.1 increments and the res u lts for the datasets are presented in the followin g section. 5.1 Results for English Dataset The precision and the aspect covera g eres u lts of CMSOS for the En g lish dataset are g iven in Table 3 and Table 4. These val u es are obtained by takin g the avera g eofthe res u lts obtained for all &lt; prod u ct,aspect &gt; t u ples.

The res u lts in Table 3 show that in terms of precision, cosine similarity with tf per-forms better than cosine similarity with tf-idf. Act u ally cosine similarity with tf-idf is better for inp u ts where there are many repeated sentences. For example, we notice that the s u bject &lt; aspartame, safety &gt; incl u des sentences  X  X sparteme is safe X  and  X  X sparteme is dan g ero u s X  several times. While u sin g cosine similarity with tf, we observe that the res u ltin g s u mmary contains these sentences freq u ently. B u twhenwe u se cosine simi-larity with tf-idf, we obtain better res u lts which are not repetitive. The res u lts obtained by o u r method u sin g cosine similarity with tf or cosine similarity with tf-idf are g iven in Table 5 and Table 6 6 . As expected, tf-idf u sa g e inhibits the effects of repetitive terms, and can prod u ce more informative s u mmaries.

Table 4 shows that cosine similarity with tf and cosine similarity with tf-idf performs similarly as lambda val u e g ets lar g er for aspect covera g e. Aspect covera g eres u lts stay nearly balanced aro u nd 0.90-0.95 for different  X  val u es.
 We compare the res u lts of o u r method to the res u lts reported in [8], in Table 7. Two different methods proposed in [8], namely Representativeness First (RF) and Con-trastiveness First (CF), are g iven with labels  X  X im et al-RF X  and  X  X im et al-CF X  respec-tively in the table. We also show the res u lts of cosine similarity with tf-idf and cosine similarity with tf res u lts in the table. CMSOS confi gu rations g enerally g ive the best re-s u lts for precision and aspect covera g e on this dataset. In CF if the initially chosen pair of sentences is not optimal this affects the q u ality of the o u tp u ts u mmary badly. CM-SOS optimizes for representativeness and contrastiveness at the same time. It is able to choose m u ltiple sentences from an aspect and it is not affected by any previo u sly chosen sentence pairs.

O u r method g ives the same priority to representa tiveness and contrastiveness, and it performs better than the methods that g ive precedence to one over the other. Co-sine similarity with tf u sa g e g enerally performs better than cosine similarity with tf-idf. However, for data with repeatin g sentences tf-idf u sa g e is more helpf u l. 5.2 Results for Turkish Dataset The avera g e precision and aspect covera g eres u lts obtained for the T u rkish dataset are g iven in Table 8 and Table 9, respectively.

In terms of precision, cosine similarity with tf and tf-idf perform similarly. The best precision res u lt is 0.927 and 0.917 for tf and tf-idf metrics respectively. The best aspect covera g eval u es are 0.928 and 0.901 for cosine similarity with tf and tf-idf metrics respectively.

Comparison of En g lish and T u rkish res u lts show that the CMSOS al g orithm per-forms eq u ally well for both datasets, in terms of aspect covera g e. However, in terms of precision the al g orithm performs worse for the En g lish dataset (abo u t 0.650) than the T u rkish dataset (abo u t 0.920). This is the res u lt of difference between the n u mber of as-pects labeled by u sers. The avera g en u mber of aspects for the items in En g lish dataset is abo u t 2.80, whereas, it is abo u t4.45fortheT u rkish dataset. Therefore, it is easier to findana g reed pair for T u rkish set than the En g lish set.

We present the first res u lts on the T u rkish dataset. We conject u re that these res u lts will be u sef u l preliminary res u lts for f u rther research on this problem. Traditional opinion s u mmarization techniq u es do not o u tp u t contrastin g sentences as a feat u re. In order to deal with this problem a new kind of opinion s u mmarization prob-lem, namely contrastive opinion s u mmarization (COS), is introd u ced in the literat u re. In this paper, we presented a new COS method, namely Contrastive Max-S u m Opinion S u mmarization(CMSOS), for this p u rpose. We considered representativeness and con-trastiveness at the same time, and applied cosine similarity with tf and cosine similarity with tf-idf meas u res.
For the eval u ation, we u sed a known En g lish dataset, and we compared o u rres u lts to the ones of [8], who have the initial res u lts on this dataset. We obtained better re-s u lts than their res u lts. We observed that u sin g cosine similarity with tf for calc u lations performed better than tf-idf u sa g e. However, for data with a lot of repeated sentences we conject u re that tf-idf u sa g e is more helpf u l. In addition, we created a new T u rkish dataset for the COS p u rposes, which can also be u sed as data for f u rther research that needs ratin g , review and/or aspect labeled data in T u rkish. We eval u ated the CMSOS method on the new T u rkish dataset and reported the res u lts in this paper.

F u t u re work incl u des plans for increasin g the size of the T u rkish dataset, makin g the eval u ation step a u tomatic by a u tomatic extraction of aspect names, and also applyin g CMSOS to the m u ltiple prod u ct review s u mmarization problem.
