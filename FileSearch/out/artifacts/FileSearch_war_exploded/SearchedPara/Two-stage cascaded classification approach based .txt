 1. Introduction
Automatic speech/music discrimination (SMD) has become a research topic of interest in the last few years. Several approaches have been described in the recent literature for different applications ( Saunders, 1996; Richard et al., 2007; Scheirer and
Slaney, 1997; El-Maleh et al., 2000; Harb and Chen, 2003; Keum and Lee, 2006; Wang et al., 2008 ). Each of them uses different features and pattern classification techniques, and describes results on different material.

Saunders (1996) proposed a real-time speech/music discrimi-nator, which was used to automatically monitor the audio content of FM audio channels. Richard et al. (2007) have recently developed a combined supervised and unsupervised approach, which includes feature selection, for automatic segmentation of radiophonic audio streams.

In automatic speech recognition (ASR) of broadcast news, it is desirable to disable the input to the speech recognizer during the non-speech portion of the audio stream. Scheirer and Slaney (1997) developed a SMD system for ASR of audio sound tracks. Thirteen features and three classification schemes (MAP Gaussian,
GMM and k -NN) were exploited, resulting in an accuracy of over 90%. Matsunaga et al. (2004) proposed in an audio source segmentation method for automatic indexing of broadcast news, which relies on spectral correlation features.

Low bit-rate audio coding is another application that can benefit from distinguishing between speech and music. Designing an universal coder to reproduce well both speech and music is the best approach. However, it is not a trivial issue. An alternative approach consists of designing a multi-mode coder that can accommodate different signals. The appropriate module is selected by using the output of a speech X  X usic classifier ( Tancerel et al., 2000; Exposito et al., 2007 ).

Automatic SMD is an important tool in many multimedia applications. El-Maleh et al. (2000) propose in a low delay (20ms) speech/music classification approach , suitable for real-time multi-media applications. An emerging multimedia application is content-based indexing and retrieval of audiovisual data. Audio content analysis is an important task for such application ( Zhang and Kuo, 2001; Lu et al., 2002). Minami et al. (1998) proposed an audio-based approach to video indexing, where SMD is used to browse a video database. In Gong and Xiong-wei (2006), content-based indexing and retrieval of cognitive multimedia is performed using SMD. The gray correlation analysis method is applied, which makes the algorithm feasible for real-time multimedia applications.
Comparative analysis of different types of features for SMD is provided in Carey et al. (1999) . Experimental results showed that cepstra and delta cepstra bring the best performance. Mel-frequencies spectral or cepstral coefficients (MFSC or MFCC) are very often used features for audio classification tasks. In Harb and
Chen (2003) , MFSC X  X  first order statistics are combined with neural networks, providing quite good results. MFCC have been widely used in ASR, and proposed in last few years for musical genre classification ( Tzanetakis and Cook, 2002; Burred and Lerch, 2004; Ezzaidi and Rouat, 2007 ). Comparison of statistical and information theory measures for automatic musical genre classification is reported in Ezzaidi and Rouat (2007) .
In the problem of audio classification, the requirements of low-complexity, high-accuracy and short delay are crucial for some practical scenarios. In Wang et al. (2008), the authors propose a real-time SMD method based on a hierarchical decision tree, which comes with promising short delay of 10ms, high accuracy of 98% and low complexity. Only two signal characteristics (amplitude and mean frequency) are used in Panagiotakis and
Tziritas (2005), giving also rise to a short delay (20ms), high accuracy (95%) and low complexity SMD approach.

The main contribution of the paper is the two-stage cascaded classification scheme based on genetic fuzzy learning for SMD. It achieves a meaningful improvement in the classification accuracy rate by incorporating a fuzzy rules-based system (FRBS), which evolves using genetic learning algorithms. The proposed classifi-cation scheme consists of a classical statistical pattern recognition (SPR) classifier followed by the FRBS (two-stage cascaded classification scheme). It results in a robust and effective approach for SMD.

This paper is structured as follows. Comprehensive review of the main existing approaches for SMD and the areas of application are discussed in Section 1. Section 2 is devoted to the proposed
SMD approach. It consists of two parts: (1) brief description of classical features for SMD and (2) the proposed two-stage cascaded classification scheme. Experimental results are shown in Section 3, which allow to assess the performance of the proposed classification approach. Finally, Section 4 outlines some meaningful conclusions and future research lines. 2. The proposed speech/music discrimination approach
Section 2 is organized in two parts. First, Section 2.1 reviews the most commonly used features in audio classification tasks, which represent timbral texture, and are based on the short time
Fourier transform (STFT). Then, the two-stage cascaded decision-taking scheme is described in Section 2.2, which also contains the motivation of using the proposed classification scheme. 2.1. Classical features for speech/music discrimination
Most of the works concerning audio classification rely on three types of features: timbral texture features, rhythmic content features and pitch content features ( Tzanetakis and Cook, 2002;
Burred and Lerch, 2004 ). However, timbral texture features are the most commonly used in audio classification when it is reduced to
SMD. The features used to represent timbral texture are based on low-level signal features proposed for music X  X peech discrimina-tion ( Scheirer and Slaney,1997 ) and speech recognition ( Davis and
Mermelstein, 1980 ). These features are based on the STFT and are calculated for every short-time frame of sound. The following low-level signal features, representing timbral texture, are used in this work for assessing the robustness of the proposed classification scheme: (1) Spectral centroid ( SC ). The spectral centroid is defined as the center of gravity of the magnitude spectrum of the STFT:
C where M t  X  n is the magnitude of the Fourier transform at frame t and frequency bin n . The centroid is a measure of spectral shape and higher centroid values correspond to  X  X  X righter X  X  textures with more high frequencies. (2) Spectral rolloff ( SR ). The spectral rolloff is defined as the frequency R t below which 85% of the magnitude distribution is concentrated:
The rolloff is another measure of spectral shape. (3) Spectral flux ( SF ). The spectral flux is defined as the squared difference between the normalized magnitudes of successive spectral distributions:
F where N t  X  n and N t 1  X  n are the normalized magnitude of the
Fourier transform at the current frame t , and the previous frame t 1, respectively. The spectral flux is a measure of the amount of local spectral change. (4) Time domain zero crossings ( ZC ). This timbral texture feature is defined as:
Z where the sign function is 1 for positive arguments and 0 for negative arguments and x  X  n is the time domain signal for frame t . Time domain zero crossings provide a measure of the noisiness of the signal. (5) Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients ( MFCC ). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are perceptually motivated features that are also based on the STFT. After taking the log-amplitude of the magnitude spectrum, the FFT bins are grouped and smoothed according to the perceptually motivated Mel-frequency scaling. Finally, in order to decorrelate the resulting feature vector a discrete cosine transform (DCT) is performed.
Although typically 13 coefficients are used for speech representation, it has been found that the first five coefficients provide the best performance for musical genre classification of audio signals ( Tzanetakis and Cook, 2002 ). Therefore, we have also used the first five coefficients in our speech/music discrimination approach, without adding the derivatives. The use of MFCC to separate music and speech has been explored in Logan (2000) .

In this work, an analysis window of 23.22ms (1024 samples at 44,100Hz sampling rate) is defined. It implies that parameter N is equal to 1024. A texture window of approximately 1s (43 analysis windows) is also defined. Overlapping with a hop size of 512 samples is performed, which results in a feature vector or matrix F for each texture window. When the low-level signal feature to be extracted is SC, SR, SF or ZC, a 86-length feature vector is obtained for each texture window. However, when the low-level signal features to be extracted are the first five MFCC, a feature matrix of size 5 86 is obtained. The texture window is shifted by 250ms, which entails updating feature vector or matrix F every 250ms.
From feature vector or matrix F , statistical values (mean, standard deviation and skewness) are computed for each 1 second-length texture window.

Fig. 1 shows the windows scheme defined in this work to obtain the input values to the classification stage.
The values here considered for the length of the analysis and texture windows (23.22ms and 1s, respectively) are widely used in other related works dealing with SMD ( El-Maleh et al., 2000;
Tzanetakis and Cook, 2002; Burred and Lerch, 2004; Wang et al., 2003 ). Although other different values are possible, the chosen values provide a good trade-off between accuracy, complexity and delay. 2.2. Two-stage cascaded classification scheme
The proposed classification scheme consists of two constitutive elements that operate in series. First, the values of the statistical features provided by the analysis stage every second are the input of a SPR classifier. As just stated, these values are updated each 250ms, which involves updating the probability provided by the
SPR classifier each 250ms. Next, a FRBS processes the last four probabilities at the output of the SPR classifier, taking a decision (speech or music). With four probabilities, a trade-off solution between the classification accuracy rate and the training compu-tational cost is found, as explained at the end of this section.
According to this scheme, the FRBS makes a decision each 250ms, taking into account not only the probability provided by the SPR classifier at the current texture window, but also the probabilities at the three previous texture windows, the hop size being 250ms. Therefore, the proposed classification scheme, composed of a SPR classifier followed by a FRBS, incorporates memory to the speech/music discriminator, which allows to increase the classification accuracy rate, as shown in Section 3.
The basic idea behind SPR ( Duda et al., 2000 ) is to estimate the probability density function (pdf) for the feature vectors of each class. In supervised learning, a labeled training set is used to estimate the pdf of each class. In the simple Gaussian (GS) classifier, each pdf is assumed to be a multidimensional Gaussian distribution whose parameters are estimated using the training set. In the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifier, each class pdf is assumed to consist of a mixture of a specific number K of multidimensional Gaussian distributions. Unlike the k -NN classi-fier, which needs to store all the training feature vectors in order to compute the distances to the input feature vector, the GMM classifier only needs to store the set of estimated parameters for each class. The iterative expectation X  X aximization algorithm is usually used to estimate the parameters of each Gaussian component and the mixture weights.

In this work, we have used two widely used SPR classifiers (GMM and k -NN). Besides, three much modern classification techniques, such as neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), have also been considered for the first stage of the classification scheme. Particularly, we have employed a multi-layer perceptron NN, which consists of three layers: the input layer with three neurons (one for each statistical feature), the hidden layer with also three neurons and the output layer with only one neuron. The SVM is based on radial basis functions. The fuzzy inference system is zero-order type and bell-shaped membership functions have been considered.

A FRBS is a system based on fuzzy logic, which aims to solve imprecise, uncertain or qualitative decision-making problems in similar way to humans. A FRBS can be characterized in terms of their fundamental constituents: fuzzification, knowledge base, inference engine and defuzzification.

Fuzzification . Process of mapping from the system inputs to fuzzy sets in a defined universe, which gives rise to the membership functions associated to each one of the system inputs.

Knowledge base . It is composed of the base of rules and the data base. The data base contains the definition of the fuzzy linguistic terms. The base of rules is constituted by the collection of fuzzy rules representing the expert knowledge. A fuzzy rule is a conditional statement with the form:
R: IF  X  X 1 is A 1  X  AND  X  X 2 is A 2  X  AND ...  X  X n is A where X i and Y are the linguistic variables, and A i and B are fuzzy sets.

Inference engine . It uses the knowledge base and the fuzzy inputs to make inference by means of a reasoning method. The inference engine is based on the application of the generalized modus ponens, extension of the classical logic modus ponens, in the following way:
R: IF  X  X is A  X  THEN Y is B ; X is A ) Y is B where the consequent B is deduced by projection on Y of the compositional rule of inference B  X  A 3 R , 3 being the composi-tion operator. The inference procedure is determined by two factors: the implication operator applied to each rule and the composition operator used to combine outputs from all rules.
In this work, the minimum operator is considered for the fuzzy implication and the max X  X in operator for the composition.
Defuzzification . It is used to reconvert the fuzzy output values, derived from the inference mechanism, into crisp values. The output of the inference engine is a fuzzy set, and for practical applications a crisp value is needed. The most used strategy for defuzzification is the center of area (COA) method, which gives the center of gravity of the output membership function.
As just stated, the FRBS is cascaded with the SPR classifier in order to reduce the number of misclassification errors. The FRBS makes a decision about the class (speech or music) of the current audio frame from four input parameters: probabilities p 0 , p 1 obtained by the SPR classifier for four consecutive 1s-length texture frames, the last of them being the current frame and the hop size 250 ms. The FRBS has only one output parameter, called decision , which ranges from 0 to 1. If decision is higher than 0.5, the fuzzy system decides in favor of speech . Otherwise, it decides in favor of music . All probabilities are [0,1] normalized. The structure of the proposed two-stage classification scheme is shown in Fig. 2 . Input and output membership functions are represented in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively.

Some details about membership functions are now reported in order to explain the meaning of Figs. 3 and 4 . The membership function of a fuzzy set is a generalization of the indicator function in classical sets. In fuzzy logic, it represents the degree of truth as an extension of valuation. Membership functions were introduced by Zadeh in the first paper on fuzzy sets ( Zadeh, 1965 ). The membership function which represents a fuzzy set ~ A is usually denoted by m ~ A . For an element x of set X , the value m the membership degree of x in the fuzzy set ~ A . The membership degree m ~ A  X  x  X  quantifies the grade of membership of element x to the fuzzy set ~ A . The value 0 means that x is not a member of the fuzzy set; the value 1 means that x is fully a member of the fuzzy set; the values between 0 and 1 characterize fuzzy members, which belong to the fuzzy set only partially.
 As can be seen in Fig. 3 , there are three fuzzy sets (Music,
Speech, Both) for each input variable ( p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , p there are only two fuzzy sets (Music, Speech) for the output variable (see Fig. 4 ).

When the obtained knowledge for the FRBS is not considered good enough to be used, some kind of learning is needed. In such sense, automatic definition of FRBS can be considered in many cases as an optimization or search process. Genetic algorithms (GA) are known to be capable of finding near optimal solutions in complex search spaces. In this work, the new rules added to the knowledge base of the FRBS have been obtained using genetic algorithms-based evolutionary computation (genetic learning algorithms), giving rise to a genetic fuzzy system (GFS). This means that the FRBS is evolved by a genetic learning process. A good review of GFS is found in Cordon et al. (2001) . The main genetic learning algorithms for FRBS are known as Michigan (Booker,1982 ), Pittsburgh ( Smith,1980 ) and iterative rule learning (IRL) ( Venturini, 1992 ).

In this work, the most widely used genetic learning algorithms (Michigan and Pittsburgh) have been evaluated for SMD, as shown in Section 3. Some comments about them are given below.
The Michigan approach . Each single fuzzy if-then rule is coded and handled as an individual. The performance of each rule is used as its fitness value. Michigan approach maintains a population of rules with genetic operations and credit assign-ment applied at the level of the individual rule. Each rule in the population has an associated strength. Hence, all rules compete to participate in the next generation. However, they also must cooperate to establish rule bases that perform well with respect to the given objective function. This cooperation X  competition dualism must be well balanced to obtain good results. Optimization of FRBS is indirectly performed by searching for good fuzzy if-then rules, which are inherited with no modification to the next population. The genetic learning process for SMD using the Michigan approach is illustrated in Fig. 5 .

The Pittsburg approach . A number of fuzzy if-then rules is coded and handled as an individual (chromosome). Each chromo-some represents an entire base of rules and evolution is accomplished by means of genetic operators applied at the level of fuzzy rule sets. The fitness function evaluates the accuracy of the entire rule base encoded in the chromosome.
Thus, the genetic search for finding rule sets with high fitness values is equivalent to the search for FRBS with high performance; that is, optimization of FRBS is directly handled by genetic algorithms that try to maximize the fitness function.
Some good rule sets in the current population are inherited to the next population with no modification as elite individuals. The genetic learning process here proposed for SMD using the Pittsburgh approach is illustrated in Fig. 6 .
 Finally, the basic mechanisms of the GFS adopted in this work for SMD are presented:
Coding of the fuzzy rule base . The rules are coded by integer numbers that represent the index of fuzzy sets that appear in the antecedent and consequent part of the rule. Each rule contains another integer number to indicate the connector between the antecedents ( X  X 0 X  X  for the OR connector and  X  X 1 X  X  for the AND connector).
 Initial population . The initial population is randomly generated.
Fitness Function . The GFS takes a decision every 250ms. Two types of error can appear: an audio frame is labeled as speech when it is a music frame (music as speech error, MSE) and the opposite (speech as music error, SME). In order to design and evaluate the GFS, the fitness function considers both types of error: Ev  X  MSE  X  SME  X  5  X 
Genetic operators . The genetic operators used in this work are one-point crossover, stochastic universal sampling selection and mutation. Mutation involves substituting an existing rule by another randomly generated one. All these genetic opera-tors work according to the elitist strategy.

Stopping condition . In computer simulations, time has been
Finally, we have chosen four 1s-length texture windows as a trade-off solution between the classification accuracy rate and the computation cost to obtain the knowledge base in the GFS. As the number of 1s-length windows increases, the classification rate asymptotically grows until a maximum is reached, but the computational cost for obtaining the knowledge base exponen-tially grows. Therefore, the chosen value allows achieving high classification rates with a feasible computational cost. 3. Experimental results
The audio test database has been carefully prepared. It has been used for assessing the proposed SMD approach. The database consists of a continuous 1-h audio signal representative of the two corresponding audio classes (speech and music). The speech data has been taken from news programs with different levels of noise, dialogs and announcements of radio and TV stations with and without music background, and the languages involve English,
Spanish, French, German, Catalonian and Portuguese. The speak-ers involve male and female with different ages. The music data has been taken from musical programs of radio and TV stations too, and consist of songs and instrumental music. The songs cover several musical genres, such as rock, pop, folk, rap, hip-hop and funky, and they are sung by male and female in English and
Spanish. The instrumental music covers different instruments (piano, violin, cello, pipe, clarinet) and styles (symphonic music, chamber music, jazz, electronic music). Some soundtracks which consists of several instruments are also included. We have attempted that the data sets are representative of the two classes to be classified (speech and music) so that the results are indicative of the discrimination performance with real-world unknown signals.

For experimental fairness, a detailed description about the audio database used in the experiments is provided in Table 1 .
The classification results are calculated using a 10-fold cross-validation evaluation, where the dataset to be evaluated is randomly partitioned so that 10% is used for testing and 90% is used for training. The process is iterated with different random partitions and the results are averaged. The results presented in this section are obtained with 50 iterations. This ensures that the calculated accuracy will not be biased because of a particular partitioning of the whole dataset for training and testing. The sign in the tables of Section 3 shows the standard deviation of the classification accuracy rate for the iterations.

First, we assess the speech/music discrimination capability of the proposed two-stage cascaded classification scheme. To achieve such goal, the following low-level signal features, representing timbral texture, are here considered: spectral centroid (SC), spectral rolloff (SR), spectral flux (SF), time domain zero crossings (ZC) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). These features are described in Section 2.1. They all are computed using the 1s-length texture window, and updated every 250ms.

Table 2 displays the classification accuracy percentage for all considered timbral features when the proposed two-stage cascaded classification scheme is assessed using different widely used classifiers ( k -NN, GMM, NN and SVM) for the first stage. ANFIS is also considered for comparison. The GFS is evolved by the Pittsburgh approach (choice by default).

From results in Table 2 , a detailed comparative analysis of all considered features and classifiers is accomplished, which provides reliable knowledge about the best ranked features and classifiers for the proposed SMD approach. The results in Table 2 evidence that MFCC always performs better than the other tested timbral features for the proposed SMD approach. The results in
Table 2 are in line with the results given in other published works dealing with the same problem ( Tzanetakis and Cook, 2002;
Burred and Lerch, 2004; Mun  X  oz-Exposito et al., 2007 ). As expected, the classification accuracy percentages when using the SPR classifiers are lower than that obtained by NN, SVM and
ANFIS. Further, ANFIS slightly outperforms SVM and NN, giving rise to a really good accuracy rate (about 97%) for the best ranked feature (MFCC), at the expense of a higher computational cost.
Now, we investigate the influence of the GFS on the classifica-tion accuracy rate in the proposed SMD approach. Table 3 displays the improvement in the accuracy rate (averaged results) due to the inclusion of the GFS within the proposed two-stage classification scheme regarding the case of using only the classifier (first stage). The robustness of the GFS against different classifiers ( k -NN, GMM, NN, SVM and ANFIS) has also been assessed in Table 3 . The results in Table 3 have been obtained when MFCC (choice by default) are used in the analysis stage of the proposed SMD approach. The Pittsburgh learning algorithm (choice by default) has been applied to evolve the GFS, and the same audio database has been considered for testing the different classification schemes.

In order to perform a fair comparison between the two cases, the classification accuracy rate in the first case (without including the GFS in the classification scheme) has been obtained by applying to the classifier the statistical values corresponding to 1.75s-length texture frames.

The results in Table 3 display the good behavior of the proposed two-stage classification scheme for SMD, which implies that GFS can be an interesting component to be used in pattern recognition or classification tasks. As expected, the GFS always leads to a better performance of the speech/music discriminator. From results in Table 3 , we can say that an average reduction in the total error rate of about 4% has been achieved. The GFS leads to a similar improvement in the accuracy rate for all considered classifiers, which evidences the robustness of the GFS against the type of classifier used in the first stage of the cascaded classification scheme. The highest classification accuracy percen-tages correspond to the ANFIS+GFS scheme, the computational cost being also the highest. An average accuracy percentage of about 97% is achieved by such classification scheme. Fig. 7 graphically illustrates the performance of the proposed SMD scheme for a audio signal composed of alternating speech and music frames ( Fig. 7 (a)) under two different situations:
The classification scheme consists of only the first stage. The decision is made by a SPR classifier. The results are shown in Fig. 7 (b).

The proposed two-stage cascaded classification scheme is used. The decision is made by cascading the SPR classifier and the GFS. The results are shown in Fig. 7 (c).
 It can be seen that the number of errors is greatly reduced when the GFS is cascaded with the SPR classifier. Fig. 7 shows the two types of errors, here denoted as MSE (music as speech error) and SME (speech as music error).

Table 4 displays a comparative analysis of the two genetic learning algorithm chosen for evolving the GFS in the proposed cascaded classification scheme. They have been evaluated during the same time and using computers with the same performance in order to carry out a fair comparison. The values of the input variables for both learning algorithm are:
Michigan. 3 Initial population: 10 rules 3 Crossover probability: 0.6 3 Mutation probability: 0.1 3 Stopping condition: 24h
Pittsburgh. 3 Initial population: 20 knowledge bases 3 Crossover probability: 0.6 3 Mutation probability: 0.1 3 Stopping condition: 24h
The results in Table 4 have been obtained using MFCC for the analysis stage and SVM for the first stage of the classification scheme. This choice gives rise to the best balance between accuracy rate and computational cost of the proposed SMD approach, as displayed in Tables 2 and 3 . From values in Table 4 , it results that both genetic learning algorithms provide high classification accuracy rate, which shows the robustness of the proposed classification scheme against the learning algorithm chosen for evolving the GFS. A slight difference (about 0.7%) in favor of the Pittsburgh approach can be seen, the variance being similar in both cases.

Finally, comparison between the proposed approach and three widely referenced state-of-the-art speech/music discrimination schemes is reported. Saunders X  X  (1996) , Scheirer and Slaney X  X  (1997) and Panagiotakis and Tziritas X  X  (2005) approaches have been chosen for comparison. They all have low complexity, allowing real-time audio discrimination. The main features of the approaches to be compared are next outlined:
In the proposed approach, a trade-off solution between classification accuracy rate and complexity has been taken, which involves using MFCC and SVM+GFS.Saunders X  X  (1996) approach is based on the average zero-crossing rate (ZCR) of the time-domain waveform. A multivariate-Gaussian classifier decides the class of each audio frame. Its low computational complexity lends itself to wide application, such as the ability to automatically change channels when commercials appear.
In Scheirer and Slaney (1997) , a set of 13 time-domain and frequency-domain features are evaluated. The features are combined in several multidimensional classification frame-works (MAP, GMM, k -NN). The results shown in Fig. 7 for
Scheirer and Slaney X  X  approach are the best among all trials. Panagiotakis and Tziritas X  X  (2005) approach relies on mean signal amplitude distribution. The classifier consists of a sequence of tests based on the following features: silent intervals frequency, RMS*ZC product, maximal mean frequency, and normalized RMS variance.
 All systems have been tested under the same conditions (audio database and training/testing procedure). Note that classification accuracy rates reported in this paper differ from those reported in Saunders (1996) , Scheirer and Slaney (1997) and Panagiotakis and Tziritas (2005) mainly because the test databases are different.
Table 5 displays the classification accuracy rates for the four assessed speech/music discrimination schemes.

From Table 5 , it results that the proposed approach leads to the highest classification accuracy rates. However, its complexity is also the highest among the four assessed approaches, mainly due to MFCC computation. The proposed approach is suitable in those cases where hardware requirements are not a constraint. Despite of its lower computational cost, Scheirer and Slaney X  X  approach also provides good accuracy rates (above 92%). Panagiotakis and
Tziritas X  X  and Saunder X  X  approaches can be an interesting choice when the complexity of the algorithm becomes a critical issue, as it happens in digital hearing aid devices. In both approaches, high computational simplicity is achieved at the expense of reducing classification accuracy rates. 4. Conclusions
The paper presents an effective and robust approach for SMD based on a two-stage cascaded classification scheme, which is composed of a SPR classifier followed by a GFS. The experimental evaluation compares different commonly used timbral features (SC, SR, SF, ZC, MFCC) and classifiers ( k -NN, GMM, NN, SVM,
ANFIS) in the proposed SMD approach. Results show the good performance of the proposed classification scheme for SMD, the highest accuracy rates being obtained when MFCC are used in the analysis stage and ANFIS is used in the first stage of the classification scheme. This combination also leads to the highest complexity.

To evaluate the robustness of the proposed two-stage classi-fication scheme, different classifiers ( k -NN, GMM, NN, SVM,
ANFIS) have been considered. The two-stage classification scheme provided good results for all considered classifiers. An average improvement of about 4% is achieved due to the inclusion of the
GFS into the classification scheme. The best results (about 97%) were obtained by the ANFIS+GFS scheme, the computational cost being also the highest. Besides, the performance of the proposed classification scheme is quite similar for the two genetic learning algorithms (Michigan and Pittsburgh) here considered to evolve the GFS, with a slight difference (about 0.7%) in favor of the second one.

Therefore, experimental results reveal that the proposed approach for SMD is robust and effective enough, making it suitable for a wide variety of multimedia applications. We have in mind to implement in a close future a web services-based distributed approach to achieve time-saving in the genetic learning process, because it requires high computational cost.
