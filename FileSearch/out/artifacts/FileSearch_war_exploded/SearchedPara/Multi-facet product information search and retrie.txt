 1. Introduction
The ever changing customer preferences on product offerings have posed great challenges to manufacturing firms in offering attractive product choices while optimizing production cost. With that in concern, mass customization has been proposed and accepted as an economically viable model. Mass customization can be viewed as a manufacturing strategy that enables manufacturing companies to better differentiate their products while satisfying production process and cost expec-tation. One of the prevailing ways in realizing mass customization is by designing and developing a family of products.
Product family design (PFD) comprises of all the challenges of product design, while adding the complexity of managing the design of multiple products in an attempt to increase commonality across the set of products without compromising their the last decade. In terms of information processing and management, PFD generally shares many common issues with product design, e.g. an effective representation schema for better information exchange. However, with the increasing number of prod-uct choices offered at different market segments with different functional complexities, the issues of information management agement of the ever increasing product information, one of the promising approaches counts on a sound representation schema that is able to promote the comprehensiveness in modeling design information with added features for an easier change management.

As observed and discussed by Du et al. (2002b) , some of the main challenges of product family modeling include common product platform modeling, product variants derivation based on this platform model and the incorporation of various fac-eted information like design and manufacturing wise in the model. In order to address these issues, there have been a num-ber of representation schemes proposed for PFD information, e.g. relational database structure (Hegge &amp; Wortmann, 1991 ), tations mainly cater for the purpose of product variants derivation, they are generally limited to the structural aspect of product family where only the physical product modules or components are concerned. Due to this limitation, the informa-tion search and navigation in a product family using such representations are insufficient in handling advanced information search especially when query targets at multiple aspects of products, e.g. product functionality, market segmentation and environmental concern. Furthermore, existing modeling schemes are also limited when they model the complex interrela-tions of physical components which are non-structural based, such as assembly and demand wise. Therefore, the need for a better information representation scheme is pressing to address all these issues.
 Among these different schemes, ontology based representation is catered especially for a semantically rich environment.
The semantic features of ontology suggest many potential applications in design engineering, such as semantic based multi-faceted search, navigation, knowledge extraction and analysis. In the context of PFD, information search and retrieval based on a multi-faceted product family ontology enables product designers to quickly search for relevant product family informa-tion for various tasks in designing product variants or forming a product platform. Due to its inherited nature of semantics, this feature is often deemed very helpful in processing those vague design requirements like customer voices. With the mul-ti-faceted product family information search and retrieval, the process of developing product platform and its associated product variants can be accelerated. This brings many practical benefits such as shorter design cycle and cost improvement.
However, ontology development in design engineering remains challenging because, for instance, the semantic annota-tion for product related information is still a time consuming and human intensive task. The majority of previous studies on semantic annotation in design engineering attempt this issue through intensive domain literature studies, where human annotators are employed to annotate domain specific concepts and relations based on their comprehension of domain liter-become a burden for human annotators as the ontology evolves with more incremental information. In view of the large amount of product offerings available in the market, an effective means of semantic annotation for ontology development, that is able to require less human efforts and efficiently absorb changes and requirement updates in design information, is still a fundamentally challenging research issue. Therefore, it would be highly desirable if an approach, which can automat-ically suggest semantic tags based on the design repository, can be proposed.

In this study, we propose a faceted search and retrieval framework based on the semantically annotated product family ontology to address the challenges in intelligent product family information management. Section 2 surveys the related studies on semantic annotation. Section 3 gives a more focused review on semantic annotation in design engineering with a purpose to stress the scarcity of relevant research. Section 4 reports the state of the art of information modeling and man-agement in PFD. Section 5 elaborates our proposed framework of information search and retrieval for PFD. Section 6 presents a case study of two digital families to discuss some details of our approach like semantic tags identification, faceted search and retrieval and its promising application in deriving new product variants. Finally, Section 7 concludes with our comments on some immediate future work. 2. Related work
Due to an ever increasing number of services and applications offered by Semantic Web and Web 2.0, semantic annota-tion has emerged as an important research topic. The goal of Semantic Web research is to transform the Web from a linked document repository into a distributed knowledge base and an application platform that allows a wider range of information and services to be more effectively utilized (Horrocks, 2007 ). One of the fundamental components of Semantic Web is the annotation of Web services to make them computer-interpretable, use-apparent and agent-ready ( McIlraith &amp; Zeng, 2001). The use of annotation, particularly in Web 2.0 applications such as social book-marking, wikipedias or blogs, has wit-nessed an apparently increasing trend of user annotated contents dedicated to information sharing and retrieval purpose (Horrocks, 2008; Wu, Zhang, &amp; Yu, 2006 ).

Semantic annotation of textual as well as multimedia contents enables a better analysis, retrieval and exchange of digital
Dai, 2007 ) and ontology-based patent document mining (Ghoula, Khelif, &amp; Dieng-Kuntz, 2007 ). Other applications include ontology-based information extraction (Boufaden, 2003 ; Li &amp; Bontcheva, 2007 ), named entity recognition ( Mayfield, several attempts such as ontology-based matching (Ghoula et al., 2007; Li, Yu, et al., 2007 ), lattice-based tagging (Mayfield conditional random field ( Grilheres, Canu, Beauce, &amp; Brunessaux, 2005 ). A more recent study by Mei, Xin, Cheng, Han, and Zhai (2007) performed semantic annotation on frequent patterns by constructing context models and searching for semantically similar patterns. We note that most existing approaches in text-based annotation employ unsupervised ap-proaches that involve little or almost no human intervention.

Multimedia annotation that involves image and video annotation is another important application area of semantic annota-tion. Semantic annotation of images attempts to link low-level image features with high-level domain concepts, which is com-monly termed as thesemanticgapproblem ( Hollink,Little,&amp; Hunter,2005 ).Ontology-basedapproach hasbeen widely used for image annotation. The domain knowledge required for annotation can also be extracted from information associated with the images, such as textual image descriptions and even captions. Such annotation efforts can thus be semi-automatically accom-2006),orbyusingontology-basedsimilaritymatchingbetweenimagedescriptionterms( Soo,Lee,Li,Chen,&amp;Chen,2003 ;Wang, objectmodelapproach ( Hua,Wang, Liu, &amp; Lu,2005 ) are alsoattempted. Theapplicationof image annotation ismainly forimage indexing and retrieval ( Hua et al., 2005; Osman et al., 2007; Pham et al., 2007 ; Von-Wun et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2008 ).
On the other hand, semantic annotation on videos also serves the similar purpose for indexing and retrieval, widely known in Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) (Chang &amp; Liu, 1984 ). The existing video annotation approaches are based on the analysis of transliterations or transcripts of a video recording (Dowman, Tablan, Cunningham, &amp; Popov, 2005; Repp, the knowledge foundation for annotation. Currently, efforts reported in video annotation focus on ontology-assisted manual transcript based language processing (Repp et al., 2007, 2008 ). 3. Semantic annotation in design engineering
Research studies on harnessing semantic annotation in design engineering have just started to capture the attention of researchers very recently. Semantic annotation has been used in the process of developing ontology or taxonomy for infor-mation extraction and retrieval. One research topic is to extract features from design information models. For instance, Au and Yuen (2000) proposed the linguistic approach to model sculptured models and presented the taxonomic relations be-tween three levels of abstraction at object level, feature level and geometry level respectively. Fu, Ong, Lu, Lee, and Nee (2003) attempted to extract features from data exchange part model using a multilevel feature taxonomy which defines the relationships between design features and manufacturing features for feature identification in computer aided design models. Catalano, Giannini, Monti, and Ucelli (2007) performed three dimensional car annotation using a car aesthetic ontol-ogy. The aim was to annotate geometric properties of a 3D car model.

The studies discussed so far focus on feature identification for annotating relevant feature semantics in a particular design model. There are also other studies related to information extraction that are meant for information retrieval purpose. Kim,
Bracewell, and Wallace (2007) employed an integrated taxonomy of engineering design for answer tags extraction and gen-eration from engineering documentation. By using rhetoric structure theory for discourse analysis on engineering docu-ments, the annotation process was performed on engineering documents and eventually the tagged documents served as the knowledge base for a question and answering system. Questions were analyzed syntactically and semantically in order to search for the best answers from the knowledge repository based on a scoring mechanism.

Another related study is on engineering documentation retrieval by Li, Raskin, and Ramani (2007, 2008). They used an engi-neeringontologydevelopedfortheannotationofgeneral engineering documentationso thata domainspecificontologycanbe generated,andbasedonthisontologyengineeringinformationretrievalcanbecarriedout.Itallowsuserstonavigateaccording to the query-dependent concept categories in the ontology. Kitamura, Washio, Koji, and Mizoguchi (2006) and Kitamura et al. (2006) presented the funnotation framework, an ontology-based function annotation framework for engineering document annotation. The framework assists designers to annotate documents based on the classes of product functions and the  X  X  X ay to achieve such a function X  for the semantic-based design search system. Hence, design documents can be effectively retrieved for future design reference. In summary, the applications of semantically annotated ontology in design engineering are meant forfeature identification indesignmodelsand fordocumentmanagement andretrievalwith aclear focus on designreferences. 4. Information management in product family design
Product family refers to a set of similar products that share common features, but yet possess some specific functions text of product design, a product family can be regarded as a set of products that are derived from a product platform where the platform itself consists of a set of common physical product modules or components, with some distinguishable or cus-tomizable modules or components that can be fitted in the platform to perform certain specific product functions. The chal-lenges in PFD range from designing product platforms to selecting the best product configuration for a cost effective manufacturing strategy in product realization. From the product family perspective, knowledge management of PFD that covers product family related information modeling, extraction and retrieval is important for design analysis and timely decision making. Therefore, studies focusing on product family modeling and evaluation metrics are crucial to improve prod-uct commonality, variety and its cost structure.
 of digital cameras that caters for the low-end to mid range market. The high-end model is shown on the right side. It can be noticed that the series number for a family of product also shows some clues. For instance, product iDC 2700 and iDC 2900 belong to the same product family iDC 2XXX, while iDC 3200 belongs to the higher range of product family iDC 3XXX.
The basic idea of product family aims to achieve as many product variants as possible, but with less number of unique modules or components and without compromising individual product distinctiveness. As observed in Fig. 1 , the two prod-uct variants, iDC 2700 and iDC 2900, possess some common product modules. For example, they both share the same camera body, flash module, power module and screen module. These are the product modules that are common to iDC 2XXX family.
What really distinguish between the two product variants are customizable product modules. Shown in Fig. 1 , both product variants have different image processing capabilities. Overall, iDC 2900 is equipped with better image processing gears fea-tured with better image processing technology, image sensor technology and better optical zoom compared to iDC 2700.
Asforthehighendproduct,iDC3XXXproductfamilyhasmoresuperiorcommonproductmodulesthanwhatiDC2XXXprod-uct family does, although these two families share the same lens module. In the example, the iDC 3XXX series has better screen displaywithtouchscreenfunction,andenjoyshigherbatterycapacity.Intermsofcustomizedproductmodules,thiscameraalso possesses better image processing features such as auto focusand face detection, coupledwith greater image sensing capability.
The main objective of product family modeling is to effectively model and manage product variants in order to reduce uct design, Bill of Materials (BOM) is commonly used to model the raw materials, parts or components needed to manufac-ture a product. However, the amount of product information to be managed can be very large causing high data redundancy problem when the new product variants are being designed. The concept of Generic Bill of Materials (GBOM) was later intro-least amount of information by clustering common product components, sub-components and parts of different product variants but from the same product range into a unified product structure.

Other works on product family modeling include Jiao and Tseng (2000) who had proposed a conceptual framework of product family architecture consisting of three perspectives: functional, technical and structural. Du et al. (2001) presented the architecture of product family where the classification of product modules and the evaluation on feasibility of product variants were emphasized. The later studies by Du, Jiao, and Tseng (2002a) focused on a rule-based approach by introducing a graph rewriting system. Besides using a graph representation, there are also other studies that adopted the object-oriented approach in modeling product family (Ong et al., 2006; Zhang, Wang, Wan, &amp; Zhong, 2005 ). Object-oriented scheme in mod-eling product family allows the constraints and rules to be clearly defined and it is an easier modeling scheme implemen-tation using unified modeling language.

However, research studies in information retrieval specifically for PFD have not received much attention so far. Studies of information retrieval on PFD involve efforts of modeling and retrieving relevant product information from product family repository for design decision support. For instance, Ong et al. (2006) made use of object-oriented approach for modeling and customization of product configuration in a web based design configuration system. The system allows design engineers to maintain and update configuration knowledge bases for product families. It also allows customers to search and navigate product information that they are interested in. Using a hierarchical-based representation for BOM, Tseng, Chang, and Chang (2005) applied case based reasoning to search similar product BOMs previously established using a product BOM query in assisting new product design configuration. Similarity measures were used for BOM matching and retrieval purposes. Nanda et al. (2007) proposed to represent product family using a concept lattice for navigation purpose in the product structure of variants. Such a concept lattice based representation is considered the first attempt in product family navigation for com-monality based product family redesign.

The studies discussed so far on product family modeling aim to model product family using different representation schemes. These modeling schemes are used to address certain issues in product family, like product variant configuration ducted based on a particular family, it is desirable that the family information is well represented beforehand so that its search, navigation and retrieval can be smoothly carried out. While the efforts involved in developing product family models heavily depend on human experts, such models have very limited features to support search and navigation across different product families. In other words, existing modeling approaches are insufficient to model and manage the rich information related to product family.

In addition, although the search and navigation in design information processing, such as product structure navigation and information particularly when the product family contains a lot of product variants, or when the product structures are com-plex, or when the families are evolving. The existing search and navigation features proposed are suitable only when a single product family is concerned. Furthermore, it is also evident that currently the search and navigation of product family are mostlylimitedtothestructuralfacetofproductsonly.Informationsearchandretrievalthatsimultaneouslyinvolveotherfacets ofproducts,suchasfunctionalandmanufacturingwise,havenotbeenstudiedbefore.Therefore,amulti-facetedproductfamily informationretrievalthatenablessearchandnavigationacrossproductfamiliesandacrossdifferentaspectsofproductvariants is surely desirable for a timely retrieval of rich information so that a sound decision making in PFD can be fulfilled. 5. Faceted information search and retrieval for product family design 5.1. Framework
In this paper, we propose a framework of faceted information retrieval based on a semantically annotated multi-facet product family ontology shown in Fig. 2 . Firstly, we develop a multi-facet product family ontology for a type of product of interest. The whole process starts with the collection of product information for a number of product variants that can be possibly grouped under a product family. In order to have a better illustration of our idea, we still consider the example of camera product family with three product variants: iDC 2200, iDC 2700 and iDC 2900 in the iDC 2XXX camera family in this context. A collection of product information related to each product variant, such as information from manufacturers or other third party resources, is collected in the first place. The product entity extraction process is then performed on such product information to extract important information like product entities, concepts and their corresponding properties that a particular product constitutes. For example, one product entity from the camera family is  X  X  X attery X , under the concept of  X  X  X ower X  and its associated property is  X  X  X ithium-Ion X .

Secondly, product entities with their associated properties are identified and extracted using concepts such as frequent natural language processing techniques, we extract possible product related entities, concepts and their associated proper-ties of a product variant based on the frequent terms that are found in the collection of product information for a particular product variant. Each frequent term is assigned a weight based on its term frequency in the collection, and the term X  X  frequent terms extracted from the iDC 2200 camera information collection are  X  X  X lash X ,  X  X  X ens X ,  X  X  X ega-pixels X  and  X  X  X hutter X .
After the entity extraction process, the semantic annotation process is carried out with further processing of entities, con-relationships. Semantic annotation is the process of labeling a particular frequent term of interest with relevant semantic the process of associating product entities with semantic tags that are able to describe the semantic relationships of a prod-uct entity under different faceted domain of consideration. Previously, we have proposed an approach to automatically iden-
This method firstly performs classifications of a domain knowledge corpus in order to create the concept hierarchy, with its associated domain documents, that enables the mining of possible semantic connecting terms at different granularities. A probabilistic measure is then proposed to assess the extracted connecting terms that denote the semantic relationships be-tween two query terms of a particular class in the concept hierarchy. All the possible connecting terms extracted are then ranked in a descending order according to their corresponding measure values with the selection of some top few candidates as the representatives of the class.
 For the purpose of annotation, a collection of documents that describes possibly different facets of product are required.
The annotation process is supported by the enterprise design and manufacturing knowledge repository, where documents that describe product specifications and all the other related information such as information of product functionality, man-ufacturing process and usage reviews of products are present. Information sources for these documents includes manufac-turer X  X  design repository such as Bill of Materials (BOM), Product Data Management (PDM) or Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) databases, catalogs, engineering texts, handbooks and other third party information like public forums and profes-sional user reviews. We will discuss in more detail concerning annotation in the following section.
 Once the multi-faceted ontology is developed, it can be used to perform product family related faceted search and retrieval.
When a search query is input by a professional, it will undergo a query processing process which typically employs several NLP techniques such as tokenization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, word disambiguation and phrase chunking ( Li, Raskin, et al., withfacetedsearchandretrievalwherethecontextsofquerytermsareidentifiedandmatchedbasedonthosereferencesmade availabletothemulti-facetedproductfamilyontology.Whileweareexploringotherpossibilitieslikelocalcontextanalysisand query expansion, currently the matching of query terms with its facet in the ontology is simply conducted using regular term matchingmetricssuchascosinesimilarityandEuclidianbasedsimilarity.Overall,thisfallsintotheparadigmofontology-based the facets identified. A more detailed example is given in Section 6.2 to illustrate our ideas. 5.2. Semantic annotation
In view of the challenges of semantic annotation for fragmented texts often existed in the general context of design envi-ronment as well as online sources, such as consumer product review websites and public forums, we extended the basic idea of frequent item set mining and propose a new approach called document profile (DP) model to derive suitable semantic tags for annotation (Liu, 2009 ). Essentially, DP is concerned about how to identify some single words and word sequences which often bear salient semantic meanings at the lexical level to represent documents X  main themes. In our work, DPs are defined by a set of single words and Maximal Frequent Sequences (MFSs). A MFS is a sequence of words that is  X  X  X requent in the doc-ument collection and moreover, that is not contained in any other longer frequent sequences X  ( Ahonen-Myka, 1999 ). Different from the existing approach in generating tags based on the words X  co-occurrence patterns ( Kim et al., 2004 ), our
DP model focuses on the discovery of word frequent patterns at document sentence level which is particularly important for short texts. Furthermore, we have extended the basic idea of using pointwise mutual information (PMI) ( Church &amp; Hanks, 1990) to measure the strength of semantic association based on the terms and MFSs discovered. We propose a simple metric called averaged PMI (avgPMI) to measure the averaged strength of the semantic association among a set of features, e.g. both the terms and MFSs discovered. The avgPMI is defined as follows: where where w i and w j are the two different terms or MFSs discovered and N is the total number of features in the DP model. The avgPMI intends to interpret the idea of searching when the maximal bonding strength of semantic association is achieved with a smaller number of features, i.e. raw tags in this context. The PMI between w over the size of corpus. Since the DP model is based on sentence level, our window of words is also considered at each sen-tence level.

Algorithm 1 gives the details how we generate the DP for a document. It starts with a set of sentences S document d j . Based on the sentence support threshold r pre-specified, a set of frequent single words C selected. Given the pre-specified word gap g , C j { t j 1 only words  X  X  ABCEFI  X  are left for s jn . Therefore, the ordered pairs arising out of s ordered pair is then stored into a hash data structure, along with its occurrence information, such as location and frequency. examined and the pairs that are supported by at least r sentences are considered frequent. This set of frequent pairs is named Grams 2 .
 Algorithm 1 . Generation of Document Profile (DP)
Input: S j : a set of n pre-processed sentences in document d 1. for all sentences sS j 2. expand C j to Grams 2 , frequent ordered word pairs 3. k =2; 4. MFS j = null; 5. while Grams k not empty 6. for all seq Grams k 7. if seq is frequent 8. if seq is not a subsequence of some Seq MFS j 9. max = expand( seq ); 10. MFS j = MFS j [ max ; 11. if max = seq 12. remove seq from Grams k 13. else 14. remove seq from Grams k 15. Grams k+1 = join( Grams k ); 16. k = k +1; 17. DP j C j + MFS j ; 18. return DP j
The next phase, the Discovery phase, forms the main body of Algorithm 1. It is an iteration of gram expansion for the grams in the current Grams k , and gram joining, to form Grams k+ 1 discovered MFSs are considered suitable for expansion. The latter condition is in place to avoid a rediscovery of MFSs that have already been found. This Expand X  X oin iteration continues until an empty gram-set is produced from a Join phase.We further break the Discovery phase into the Expand phase and the Join phase. In the Expand phase, every possibility of expan-sion of an input word sequence seq form Grams k is explored. The expansion process continues, for that particular input word will be an MFS by definition, and it will be stored together with its occurrence information. This process of gram expansion and information recording continues, for every suitable gram in Grams of a simple join operation amongst the grams left in Grams When an empty gram-set is produced from the Join phase, namely, no more grams are left for further expansion, the set of
MFS j and C j is returned for document d j . In the end, the DP
DP { C j+ MFS j } is utilized as the semantic tags for document d 6. Case study and discussion 6.1. Data preparation and tags generation
In order to demonstrate the feasibility of using our proposed framework for faceted information retrieval, research data of three branded digital cameras from a major consumer electronics company were collected with the assistance of two final year project students (they also helped in developing the ontology). The three cameras: Nikon D40, Nikon D40x and Nikon
D60, belong to the same product family of digital single lens reflex (D-SLR) from Nikon, with a similar product design and specifications. The information sources include the camera manufacturer X  X  website and other third party professional cam-era review websites, such as Digital Photography Review 1
We had so far collected and selected a small collection of 39 documents on the three D-SLR cameras. The majority of these documents are detailed professional reviews. The corpus for tags generation contains about 175,000 words, with 7600 un-ique words, around 10,000 sentences in total and an average length of about 17 words for each sentence. The process of tags generation started with the preprocessing of documents. The preprocessing of documents include various standard proce-dures commonly utilized in text processing, such as tokenization, stop words removal, number and punctuation removal and word stemming. The sentence segmentation, however, was retained. With the word gap values of 0 and 1, we searched tags by increasing the value of sentence support starting from an initial point of r = 3. We ignored the sentence support of change of tag quality towards higher support values. The word gap values of g = 2 and above were not considered in our study since the MFS generated could only reflect weaker bonding power in suggesting lexical semantics.

The implementation of text preprocessing, document profile model and PMI related calculations were written and exe-cuted in Java environment. We had generated single words and MFSs from r =3to r = 15 for each single document in the corpus. Upon the tags extraction, the avgPMI values were calculated for each pair of single words and MFSs following Eqs. (1) and (2) without considering the case of longer sequences in MFSs. For instance, consider the case where two terms: a single word,  X  X  X ikon X  and a longer MFS,  X  X  X ikon camera X  are both extracted. When  X  X  X ikon X  is considered for PMI calculation, the  X  X  X ikon X  in  X  X  X ikon camera X  is not considered as we assume that the two terms should have different semantic mean-ings. For the combinations of support and gap values, we calculated the averaged avgPMI values and picked up the highest averaged avgPMI value where the words and MFSs generated had the highest semantic bonding. Fig. 3 indicates some sta-tistics on the DP model generated where the variations of the computed averaged avgPMI can be examined. From Fig. 3 , we observe that better single words and MFSs can be identified using a higher gap value, i.e. g = 1. In general, the high averaged avgPMI values at r = 3 is due to the inclusion of many irrelevant and redundant terms together with those rel-evant ones. With higher support values beyond this point, the quality of the tags generated are better with higher support values, and the averaged avgPMI values start to decline substantially until it reaches another maximum point at r =7. From the plot, we note that the quality of single words and MFSs generated starts to decline significantly after r =7.
Therefore, we choose the collection of single words and MFSs generated at r = 7 as our candidate tags for annotation purpose.

After the extraction process, we had consolidated all the single words and MFSs generated from each document to form the combined candidate terms. Here, we have roughly 380 single words and 110 MFSs in the combined set of candidate terms. Examples of the generated single words and MFSs are given in Fig. 4 . The selection indicates that the MFSs generated are indeed more relevant than single words and are representative as important keyphrases of the corpus.
 Fig. 5 demonstrates a semantically annotated multi-facet product family ontology for one of the D-SLR cameras: Nikon
D60. We built this ontology by adopting the annotation tags generated from the DP modeling. Due to the space limit, we can only visualize one product variant from the product family with partial concepts, entities and relationships. Also note that the properties of different entities are not shown due to the same reason. We grouped similar entities together and manually chose the product concepts that are the most representative ones. We had modeled the ontology based on how the product works and their physical assembly orders and relations. On the other hand, multi-facet semantic relationships in conceptual entities are suggested based on our previously study by counting on domain design knowledge repository such as Bill of Materials (BOM), Product Data Management (PDM) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) ( Yu &amp; Liu, 2008 ).
Semantic relationships that are automatically suggested with these databases greatly help reducing human efforts in anno-tation. Nevertheless, this is still part of our ongoing research efforts.

The ontology shown in Fig. 5 contains roughly 79 entities that are classified into 21 concepts. In the ontology, entities can On the other hand, links between concepts indicate their semantic relations as well. In Fig. 5 , the concept  X  X  X ower X  is
The rest concepts are associated with other facets such as  X  X  X mage X  and  X  X  X arketing X  aspects of product. The ontology for other product variants also share common concepts mainly in the structural facets interconnected with different concepts, entities and properties that make them outstanding. 6.2. Faceted search and retrieval using semantically annotated multi-facet product family ontology
In order to illustrate our proposal of a product family ontology-based information retrieval, an example of multi-faceted information retrieval based on a semantically annotated product family ontology is presented in Fig. 6 . For a better compre-hension, we consider the following two example user queries:  X  X  X igh performance, rapid charging and recyclable camera battery X   X  X  X ero mercury, long lasting and fast charging battery for camera X 
These two similar queries intend to look for camera batteries that have the stated features or functionalities. As noted, processed query terms will be transformed into a collection of noun phrases such as  X  X  X amera X  and  X  X  X attery X , or some longer adjective phrases such as  X  X  X ast charging X  and  X  X  X ong lasting X .

The next phase is faceted search and retrieval. The processed query terms are matched with the most semantically similar concepts in the multi-faceted ontology. While we are actively exploring some different possibilities, like local context anal-ysis plus a weighted multi-faceted scoring function, we are currently only using the regular matching algorithms such as term cosine similarity matching with scoring mechanism. The concept searching is performed across different ontologies to determine the most relevant context or facet of the query terms. For instance in our example, term  X  X  X amera X  and  X  X  X attery X  the concept  X  X  X ower Module X . Similarly, terms such as  X  X  X apid charging X ,  X  X  X ast charging X ,  X  X  X igh performance X  and  X  X  X ong lasting X  are semantically associated with functional facet of  X  X  X ower Module. X  In our example, there are also two terms that are semantically similar to green manufacturing concepts:  X  X  X ecyclable X  and  X  X  X ero mercury. X 
Based on these semantically similar facets determined from the query terms, the process continues with the retrieval of relevant information that fulfills these three facets. For instance, for the green manufacturing facet, the search for camera tically annotated with the features queried in the structural, functional and green manufacturing facet from domain repos-itory, and present the matched results in a consolidated manner. In this regard, this is very similar to focused retrieval.
We should notice that design and manufacturing repository contains product family information beyond a single product family, either DC-S1XX or DC-S3XX family designed by the same manufacturer. The repository may also include camera product family information explored from different manufacturers due to various reasons, e.g. competitive intelligence -marketing analysis. Therefore, the multi-faceted product family ontology can serve as an indexing structure for the search ent camera families, such as iDC-S1XX, Trueshot SX and Gpix K2XX camera family. Each product that is included in the re-trieved result of product family reveals that it is using this type of battery which we request. For instance, Trueshot S1,
Trueshot S10 and Trueshot S20 might be using the same type of battery that offers better performance, faster charging and it is environmentally friendly shown in the detailed results in Fig. 6 .

By taking advantage of the detailed results, design professionals or engineers can quickly navigate through them, either withinasingleproductfamilyoracrossproductfamilies.Withinasingleproductfamily,thesearchedresultsenableustobetter differentiate product variants that use the required battery. On the other hand, we can also navigate across different product families in order to have an overview of the camera families that have adopted the required battery, and make further compar-ison on which product family is deemed better, for instance, in terms of matching the green manufacturing benchmarking con-cept.Notethatthedetailedresultsshownin Fig.6 arepresentedintheviewofacamerafamily.Furthermanipulationonresults is possible where the structural, functional or green manufacturing views can be extended for better in-depth comparisons. 6.3. Deriving product variants using faceted search and retrieval
Based on the semantically annotated product family ontology, the function of faceted search and retrieval can be greatly helpful to derive new product variants. Coupled with evaluation features such as module comparison and platform selection, the faceted search and retrieval can assist product designers in selecting the most suitable product platform in deriving the intended product variants for the given product requirements. Consider the case presented in Fig. 7 , where the designer in-tends to design a new digital camera with the listed description of product requirements. Note that the example of product requirements here are rather fuzzy. For instance, terms such as  X  X  X ore shots X  and  X  X  X leek design X  are fuzzy terms unless we know the context and semantics behind these terms. However, with the semantically annotated multi-facet product family ontology, all these terms are able to be processed accordingly to their associated context.

The product requirement description is analyzed by query processing where important query terms are extracted for the faceted search and retrieval purpose. Based on the semantically annotated product family ontology, the query terms are then semantically associated with their corresponding facets. For example,  X  X  X leek design X  is semantically associated with  X  X  X am-era Body X  in the structural facet. The requirement of  X  X  X ore shots X  is semantically associated with two concepts in different associations, search results for product modules can be obtained from the design and manufacturing repository by counting on the multi-facet product family ontology as an indexing structure, where the parts and components that can be possibly selected for the new product variants are all semantically annotated and indexed. The search results in Fig. 7 present all the product modules across several camera families designed by the company that can fulfill the listed product requirements. In ferent product platforms: platform T and platform K.

Based on the retrieved results, the next task is to choose between the two product platforms in order to derive the in-tended product variant. By using an evaluation methodology that can perform in-depth module comparison, a solution for the best product module that fulfills our requirement can be obtained. In our example, the power module  X  X  X PG-20 1200 mAH X  is chosen because it fulfills  X  X  X ong stamina X  and  X  X  X ore shots X  requirements. As this module is bound by a specific camera casing, the selection of camera body will be limited to either  X  X  X ase W-1 X  or  X  X  X ase W-2 X  from platform T. Neverthe-module that best suits the  X  X  X un editing X  requirement.

Similarly, the image processor  X  X  X rilliant III X  is also chosen considering requirements like  X  X  X uper crisp shot technology X , modules are compared and suitably chosen, the product platform which is most suitable for deriving the intended new prod-uct variant has been identified. From the example in Fig. 7 , a possible product configuration is derived, where platform K is the designer can reuse the power module and the screen module of platform T, but may need to redesign the camera body slightly in order to accommodate all the suggested modules. This is in contrast to the adoption of Platform T where the rede-sign of camera circuit board is inevitable in order to support the new image processor.
 6.4. Other possible applications
Besides the general search and navigation purpose, other types of potential applications using the semantically annotated uct family metrics that has been established to measure the level of common product modules that are shared across differ-ent product variants, or in other sense, the similarity of product variants. The existing commonality metrics are proposed mainly based on the structural aspect of products. By applying the semantically annotated product family ontology, we can further propose a completely new commonality metric that considers not only the structural issue, but also other facets like green manufacturing and production cost. Therefore, we will have a brand-new multi-faceted commonality metric for product family analysis.

Besides the evaluation metrics, it X  X  also useful to perform product family comparison with respect to a particular product for the sake of differentiating among different product families, or assessing the similarity or commonality between two product families. Identifying a particular product family for competitors X  products can also be conducted based on the semantically annotated product family ontology, with an opening to address some challenging questions like the potential of further developing a particular family, especially in view of the competitors X  launches. Therefore, note the example pre-sented in Fig. 7 should not be stopped at the examination of existing product families from the same company only when deriving new product variants. 7. Conclusion and future work
Information management and retrieval in PFD is crucial for various decision support and design analysis purposes. In this paper, we have discussed its status quo and the potential of using semantically annotated product family ontology for infor-mation management and retrieval in PFD. A framework of faceted information search and retrieval based on the semantically annotated product family ontology has been proposed. In particular, we have proposed a document profile (DP) model to suggest semantic tags for annotation. Using a case study of digital camera families, we illustrate how the faceted search and retrieval of product information can be accomplished. We have also exemplified how we can derive new product vari-ants based on the designer X  X  query of requirements via the faceted search and retrieval of product family information. We believe that a formal and sound evaluation is needed for the approach that we have proposed. However, this also presents a challenging task given the lack of existing related studies that we are able to benchmark with. The efforts in ensuring a formal and sound evaluation for our work will be constantly pursued. In the future, we shall focus more on automatic facet identification, evaluation of semantic annotation and how to handle some complex texts like test reports involving different branded products. All these await our further exploration.
