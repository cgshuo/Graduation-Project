 Effective patent valuation is important for patent holders. Forward patent citations, widely used in assessing patent value, have been considered as reflecting knowledge flows, just like paper citations. However, patent citations also carry legal implication, which is important for patent val-uation. We argue that patent citations can either be tech-nological citations that indicate knowledge transfer or be legal citations that delimit the legal scope of citing patents. In this paper, we first develop citation-network based meth-ods to infer patent quality measures at either the legal or technological dimension. Then we propose a probabilistic mixture approach to incorporate both the legal and tech-nological dimensions in patent citations, and an iterative learning process that integrates a temporal decay function on legal citations, a probabilistic citation network based al-gorithm and a prediction model for patent valuation. We learn all the parameters together and use them for patent valuation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using patent maintenance status as an indicator of patent value and discuss the insights we learned from this study.
Patent valuation, i.e., assessing the value of patents, is an important but challenging task for firm technology and innovation management. Patent citations have been widely used in patent valuation [19, 8, 6, 7] on the ground that patent citations provide  X  X aper trails X  of knowledge flows among patents. The fact that a patent cites a large number of prior patents (hereafter, backward citations ) suggests that the patented invention has built upon  X  X he shoulders of gi-ants X , i.e., a significant amount of prior knowledge. This im-plies that the invention has great technological richness (defined as the amount of prior knowledge a patent builds upon) and likely high technological quality and economic value. Similarly, when a patent is cited by a large number of subsequent patents (hereafter, forward citations ), this in-dicates that the patented invention has led to a number of successful lines of innovation. Thus, the invention is likely to be of high technological in uence (defined as the techno-logical impact that a patent has on subsequent inventions) and thus highly economically valuable.

From such technological aspects, one might think that patent citations are similar to paper citations. However, patent citations are actually quite different from paper ci-tations in significant ways. In particular, patent citations could be interpreted in two dimensions: (i) a technological one that is related to knowledge flows, and (ii) a legal one that is related to delimitation of patent scope. Let X  X  con-sider the scenario where a patent application is under exam-ination. The patent examiner needs to search for relevant prior art (prior inventions) to determine whether the inven-tion is patentable based on its novelty and inventiveness in comparison to these prior inventions. Meanwhile, the exam-iner needs to determine the appropriate scope of the patent right by asking the applicant to modify, if necessary, the language of the claims. For example, if an inventor applies for a chemical compound that makes some novel structural modification to an existing drug. The examiner would grant a patent to the invention, but cite the prior patent on the ex-isting drug to: (i) show the knowledge link between the two inventions and (ii) to narrow down the scope of the newly granted patent so that it would cover only the modification, not the original chemical structure. In fact, the scope of the newly granted patent could be so narrowed down by the prior patent on the existing drug that the firm owning the newly issued patent may have to get a license from the paten-tee of the existing drug patent in order to market the new drug. In this case, the cited prior patent acts as a blocking patent to the newly granted patent. Similarly, an applicant, under the U.S. Patent Law, has the obligation to disclose rel-evant prior art that she knows during her research, though she has no obligation to identify all possible relevant prior art when filing an application. These applicant-inserted ci-tations could, on one hand, suggest knowledge flows, but on the other hand, be used to narrow down the patent scope.
Therefore, a citation made by patent A to patent B could suggest that there are knowledge flows from the cited patent to the citing patent (this aspect of patent citations defines the technological citations ), or that the cited patent puts le-gal constraints on the scope of the citing patent (this aspect defines the legal citations ), or both. The legal interpretation of patent citations has quite different implication in terms of what patent citations mean for patent valuation, com-pared to the technological interpretation of patent citations. From the legal aspect, when a patent cites a large number of backward citations, it could suggest that many prior patents mi ght have been used to narrow down the scope of the citing patent or block the citing patent. Consequently the citing patent might have a very narrow legal patent scope (i.e., the scope of patent right claimed), and thus likely small com-mercial value. On the other hand, when a patent receives a large number of forward citations, it might be blocking or putting constraints on these subsequent patents. In this case, a patent with a large number of forward citations im-plies a high level of legal blocking power , and thus it is a highly valuable patent.

Furthermore, legal constraints in patent citations (from the legal aspect) are time sensitive. For a patent citation with two year lag between the citing and cited patents, the cited patent could block the citing patent for a long time. However, if a patent cites an expired prior patent, then the cited patent put no legal constraints on the citing patent.
Our study aims to explore the insights about the tech-nological and legal dimensions of patent citations and pro-pose corresponding measures for patent valuation. Specif-ically, based on the technological and legal interpretations of patent citations, we propose to capture four quality mea-sures of patents, namely, technological richness , technological in uence , legal patent scope , and legal blocking power .
More importantly, and quite intuitively, we propose that there exist mutual interdependence among these four mea-sures of patents; and the two measures in the technological dimension are related to each other in a different way than the other two measures in the legal dimension are related. Consider the technological richness and influence associated with a patent A . If patent A cites prior patents that are of greater technological influence, other things being equal, the technological richness of the citing patent A is greater, as the invention builds on a lot of influential prior inventions. Meanwhile, if patent A is cited by subsequent patents that are of high technological richness, the patent A  X  X  techno-logical influence would be greater, as it leads to subsequent innovations of high quality.

By an interesting contrast, if patent A cites prior patents that are of greater legal blocking power, other things being equal, the legal patent scope of the citing patent A is smaller, as it is narrowed down by prior patents with large blocking power. However, if patent A is cited by subsequent patents that are of large legal patent scope, the patent A  X  X  legal blocking power is greater as it put constraints on subsequent patents with broad patent right that are highly valuable.
We investigate different methods to quantify the four pro-posed measures. We first assume that a patent citation can be interpreted in the technological dimension or in the legal one (or both). We then consider the case where a patent citation represents a probabilistic mixture of both techno-logical and legal citations, with the significance of legal ci-tations decaying by time (i.e.,the grant lag between a cited and citing patents). Accordingly, we capture their mutual interactions and iteratively learn the four measures using the patent data. Technically, we adopt a parameter learning process that integrates multiple models (including a tempo-ral decay in legal citations, a probabilistic citation network based algorithm for quantifying the four proposed patent quality measures, and a prediction model for patent valua-tion).

To validate our idea of distinguishing legal citations from technological citations, we empirically apply the four pro-posed patent quality measures in patent valuation. We use patent renewal status (patent maintenance) as an indicator of patent value in our experimentation. Our results show that separating technological and legal dimension in patent citations achieves better accuracy in experiments for patent value prediction. And our proposed patent quality mea-sures based on legal citations show more important roles in predicting patent value than measures based on technolog-ical citations. Our study also confirms the mutual interde-pendence between technological influence and technological richness is different from that between blocking power and legal patent scope. Moreover, by applying a probabilistic model to quantify the proposed concepts, we validate that patent citation is a probabilistic mixture of technological and legal indications and the significance of a legal citation decays by time.

To the best of the authors X  knowledge, this work repre-sents the first attempt to explore the insight that a patent citation could be a mixture of technological and legal ci-tations, to quantify the technological quality measures and legal quality measures corresponding to the two different di-mensions in patent citations, and to apply them in patent valuation. In summary, our work has made the following major contributions:
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first as-sume a deterministic model of patent citations and introduce our algorithms to derive measures related to technological citations and legal citations in Section 2. Then we develop a probabilistic mixture model of patent citations to better capture those measures in Section 3. In Section 4, we intro-duce our evaluation methodology and conduct experiments on valuation of Drug&amp;Medical patents in both firm-level and field-level. We finally review related works in Section 5 and draw conclusions in Section 6.
With the technological and legal interpretations for patent citations, an immediate question is how to model and quan-tify technological and legal citations. In this section, we first d iscuss a heuristic and deterministic model for interpreting the technological and legal dimensions of patent citations. Then we propose algorithms to quantify the four proposed patent quality measures: technological influence, technolog-ical richness, blocking power, and legal patent scope, for a focal patent.
Here we assume that a patent citation always reflects knowledge flow from the cited patent to the citing patent. Therefore, the technological dimension of a patent citation always exists. However, the legal dimension of a patent ci-tation only exists when the cited patent is not expired. In other words, if the cited patent is not expired when the cita-tion is made, the citation is of both a legal and technological citation. Otherwise, the citation only reflects the technolog-ical (knowledge) flow. Consider an example where patent A is granted in year 2000 and was maintained (renewed) at its 4 th year renewal but not at the 8 th year. If a patent B cites patent A in year 2006, we consider the citation to have both legal and technological interpretations. However, for a patent C citing patent A in year 2009, the citation is only a technological citation. Accordingly, it is fairly easy to determine whether a patent citation is a legal citation or not, since we know when a patent is expired (based on the data on patent maintenance at USPTO ).
 Citation Graphs. Based on the discussion above, we de-rive two citation graphs. One represents the technological citation network, denoted as G T = ( V; E T ) where G T is the same as the original patent citation network because here we assume that a patent citation always serves its techno-logical functionality, i.e., E T ( i; j )=1, if p i is cited by p On the other hand, the legal citation network, which cap-tures the legal implication between patents, is denoted as G
L = ( V; E L ) where E L ( i; j ) = 1 if p i is not expired at the grant year of p j ; and E L ( i; j )=0 if p j is expired when p granted. 2 Based on these two citation graphs, we propose to characterize a patent with four quality measures: techno-logical influence score, technological richness score, blocking power score and legal patent scope score. In the following, we describe two basic approaches in quantifying the four fea-tures: one is the CiteCount algorithm and the other is the CiteNet algorithm.
The CiteCount algorithm, similar to the conventional ci-tation counting approach for assessing the quality of scien-tific literature, counts the number of citations of different types, based on the technological and legal citation graphs. Given the technological citation graph G T and the legal ci-tation graph G L , we formally define the Technological Influ-ence score ( TI ), Technological Richness score ( TR ), Block-ing Power score ( BP ) and Legal Patent Scope score ( LS ) of a patent p i as follow.
 where E T ( i; j ) refers to a technological citation to patent i made by patent j . Therefore, for patent p i , its techno-
V is the set of patents and E T is the set of edges in G T E
L is the set of edges in G L . logical influence score is the number of forward citations it receives, while its technological richness score is the number of backward citations it makes.
 where E L ( i; j ) refers to a legal citation to patent i made by patent j and is the global value of legal scope in all patents. Thus, for patent p i , its blocking power score is the number of legal citations to p i when it is not expired, while its legal scope score is dependent on the number of citations which it makes when the cited patents are not expired. With p i making more legal citations, its legal scope is likely further narrowed. Therefore, the resulting legal scope is reduced from the original legal scope of p i by its legal citations. Two issues arising here are (i) the setting of the initial (global) legal scope value and (ii) the amount of the legal scope to be deducted from this patent due to legal citations. We consider legal patent scope of patent i , as defined by Eq. (4), to be greater than 0. Thus, is inherently greater than the maximal number of legal citations/references made by patent p i . While in this paper all patents are assumed to have the same initial legal patent scope, we may empirically set appropriate and use it to analyze the initial legal scopes in different domains or patent sets.
As CiteCount only counts on one-hop neighbors in the graph, the potential influence of neighbor patents located in multi-hop neighborhood is not considered. As a result, the relationship and interdependence between technological influence and richness as well as between blocking power and legal influence are not well considered. To address this issue, we derive CiteNet, a patent citation network based algorithm, to capture these mutual independence. In the algorithm, we make the following intuitive assumptions: 1. The technological influence of a patent is determined 2. The technological richness of a patent depends on the 3. The blocking power of a patent depends on the number 4. The legal patent scope of a patent is determined by the Therefore, given a citation network graph G = ( V; E ) , the CiteNet algorithm computes the four quality measures for each patent iteratively until the derived measures converge. In each iteration, the measures are derived as follows. Note that Eq.(5) corresponds to the first assumption and Eq.(6) corresponds to the second assumption. Moreover, given the legal citation network G L and a patent p i , we have:
Eq. (7) corresponds to the third assumption and Eq. (8) corresponds to the fourth assumption. Also, similar to the CiteNet method, is the initial value of legal scope and we subtract the blocking power of legal citations that p i cites from its original patent legal scope. Moreover, after each iteration, we normalize the calculated scores for the four quality measures using 2-norm normalization to guarantee the convergence of the algorithm.

In summary, CiteNet captures the independence between technological influence and technological richness, and block-ing power and legal scope in each iteration as shown in Eqs. (5)-(8). The proposed CiteNet algorithm derives the patent technological influence and richness in a way similar to the HITS algorithm that captures the mutually reinforce-ment between authoritative and hub web pages [13]. On the other hand, the derivation of the patent legal blocking power and patent scope is totally different. As Eqs. (7) and (8) show, they are based on different rules.
In the previous section, we assume that a citation is always a technological citation. Moreover, depending on whether the cited patent is expired at the time of being cited, the citation could have legal implication on the citing patent. Note that some potential issues may arise with such deter-ministic heuristics. For example, some patent citations are counted twice (as a technological citation and as a legal ci-tation), whereas others are counted only once (only as a technological citation). This seems to be ad hoc. Is there a better way to model the two dimensions of a patent cita-tion coherently? In particular, as explained earlier, a patent citation is likely to be a mixture of a technological citation and a legal citation, with different weights.

Additionally, the legal measures of a cited patent, corre-sponding to a patent citation, are assumed to remain con-stant, whether it is cited by a citing patent granted just a few years later or by another patent granted many years later. We argue that intuitively it may be more reasonable to assume that the legal power of a cited patent varies cor-responding to different citing patents granted at different years, given that they are all granted before the expiration of the cited patent. In other words, it is more realistic to assume that the legal implication of a patent citation decays as a function of the lagging years between the cited patent and the citing patent until the cited patent is expired. 3
Therefore, we propose to adopt a probabilistic approach to model patent citations. We assume that the technologi-cal and legal interpretation of a patent citation takes some weights, i.e., their total weight equals one. Meanwhile, we assume that the weight for the legal dimension decays as a function of the lagging years between the cited and the citing patents. Moreover, it becomes zero when the cited patent expires.

With such a probabilistic/mixture model of patent cita-tions, we propose, similar to Section 3, probabilistic cita-tion count (ProbCiteCount) and probabilistic citation net-work (ProbCiteNet) to quantify the four quality measures of a patent. ProbCiteNet takes into consideration the citation network structure and the interdependence between the two technological measures and between the two legal measures, while ProbCiteCount does not.

Once the decay behavior of legal citations, the constraint over total weight of legal and technological citations, and the relationships among legal and technological quality measures are properly modeled, we shall be able to model the corre-lations between the quality measures and the patent value, e.g., by formulating it as a classification problem. Putting all these together allows us to not only to derive quality measures but also learn the model parameters (such as the time dacay parameter) and analyze the importance of the patent quality measures in the classifiers for patent evalua-tion. Furthermore, learning the various model parameters enable us to study insights about valuation of patent cita-tions in a field or a firm.

In the following, we first detail our approach to model the decay function for legal citations (see Section 3.1) as well as ProbCiteCount (see Section 3.2) and ProbCiteNet (see Section 3.3). Then, we introduce our prediction model for patent value and the learning process for deriving model parameters (see Section 3.4).
Here we discuss the selection of a decay function to model the temporal decay of legal power. Two candidate functions are exponential decay or linear decay functions. An expo-nential decay function assumes that the rate of decay is pro-portional to its current value, while a linear decay function assumes that the rate of decay is constant over time, which is less applicable to our case. Consider a case where patent A (granted in 2000 and to expire in 2016) is cited by patent B in 2002 and by patent C in 2003. Since these inventions are very close in time, they are likely close substitutes to each other in the market. Thus, the one year difference be-tween the citing patents B and C could mean significantly different market values. Consequently, the weights on the legal dimension of the two patent citations could be quite different. However, suppose that patent A is cited by patent D in 2014 and by patent E in 2015, which are very far away from patent A (which is about to expire). In this case, the weights for the legal dimension of the citations correspond-
H ere the lagging years refers to the number of years the grant date of the citing patent is lagging behind the grant date of the cited patent. in g to A to D and A to E should be no much different, because inventions in patent A is fading out of the market when it is cited by patent D and E .

Moreover, the legal weight of a patent citation depends on the power of the cited patent in narrowing down and/or blocking the citing patent. Therefore, the rate at which the weight on a legal citation decays should be correlated with the turnover or product life cycle for the technology field of the cited patent. Hence, in this model, we assume that the technology domain of the cited patent, which reflected by the U.S. patent class of the cited patent, determines the temporal decay pattern, i.e., patents in the same U.S. class share the same temporal decay pattern.

Formally, let the parameter of the decay function for a given U.S. class u be u . Given two patents p i and p j where p is cited by p j , we define the weight for the legal dimension of this citation as follows.
 P ( p i ; p j ) = (9) where t i and t j are the grant dates of p i and p j respectively, and u denotes the U.S. Class of the cited patent p i .
As we consider any citation to be a mixture of the techno-logical and legal dimensions (with their total weight equals 1), the technological weight for patent p j citing patent p defined as follows.

As such, Eq. (9) and Eq. (10) govern the weighted techno-logical citation network and legal citation network, respec-tively. Next, we discuss the modeling of interdependency among the four quality measures with ProbCiteCount and ProbCiteNet.
To present the probabilistic citation count (ProbCiteCount) algorithm, we first introduce an adjacency matrix defined for deriving the four quality measures, based on the weighted technological and legal citation networks.
 Adjacency Matrix for Technological and Legal Cita-tions. We use an adjacency matrix A T to denote techno-logical citations and A L to denote the legal ones. A T ( i; j ) = P ( p i ; p j ) if p i is cited by p j , otherwise A T ( i; j ) = 0. On the other hand, A L ( i; j ) = P L ( p i ; p j ) if p i is cited by p otherwise A L ( i; j ) = 0.

Based on A T and A L , we define technological influence ( TI ) and technological richness ( TR ) for a given patent p as follows.
 where j is bounded to the set of patents in the corpus citing p and A T T is the transpose matrix of A T . Next, we define blocking power ( BP ) and legal patent scope ( LS ) for a given patent p i , based on citation count as follows.
 where A T L is the transpose of A L and is the global legal patent scope for each patent, defined in Section 2.
Given the weighted technological citation matrix A T and legal citation matrix A L defined above, the ProCiteNet al-gorithm iteratively derives the four quality measures, based on the mutual interdependence among them, as discussed in Section 2. Formally, we define technological influence ( TI) and technological richness ( TR) for the given patent p i follows.
 In Eq. (15) and Eq. (16), j refers to the patents citing patent p and the patents cited by patent p i , respectively.
Similarly, we define blocking power score ( BP) and legal patent scope score ( LS) for the given patent p i as follows. where is the initial value of legal scope for each patent, and j refers to the patents citing patent p i and the patents cited by patent p i , respectively.

ProbCiteNet, similar to HITS algorithm [13], considers mutual reinforcement between the technological influence and richness, as well as the blocking power and legal patent scope. However, it is different from HITS in that it oper-ates on weighted technological and legal citation graphs that take into account the two dimensions of patent citations and exponential decaying in weights. The weights on the cita-tion networks are to be learned in an integrated learning process, which uses different rules for updating different fea-tures based on mutual interdependence among features.
We argue that the four legal and technological measures can be used for patent valuation and thus derive a model to predict patent value using the proposed quality measures as features. In this section, we introduce a prediction model, which we combine with the probabilistic modeling of patent citations to learn model parameters and to derive classifiers for patent evaluation in an integrated learning process. We use logistic regression model for predicting patent value, and maximize the object function with gradient ascent method to predict patent value. Accordingly, each patent p i in the training sample can be represented as ( x; y ) where x is the feature set of p i . i.e., the four features/quality measures, and y is the predictive label used in regression. For example, the patent maintenance status may serve as a label/indicator of patent value (as discussed in detail later in Section 4). For logistic regression, we define our hypothesis function h ( x ) as follows. where the model parameter consists of (i) !  X  the weights of the features and (ii) = f 1 ; 2 ; :::; n g  X  the parame-ters of the exponential decay functions corresponding to US p atent classes. Thus, each feature value in the feature set x is a function of .

The objective function to learn the parameter of our model then is set as maximizing the following likelihood function: l ( !; ) = where i is the index of the samples in the training data set and y i is the predictive label for the i th sample. Learning in ProbCiteCount. By computing the first-order partial derivatives for ! and based on Eq. (20), we obtain: and where Z is the derivative of ! T x ( ) with respect to corre-sponding to technological influence, technological richness, blocking power and legal patent scope. Basically Z is shown as below. where ! ti , ! tr , ! bp and ! ls are weights for technological influence, technological richness, blocking power and legal patent scope, respectively.

Therefore, it gives us update rules as follows. where is the ascent step size.

With the partial derivative with respect to !; solved, we can update !; to maximize the objective function. Learning in ProbCiteNet. The update process of ! in ProbCiteNet is similar to that in ProbCiteCount. Due to space limitation, we skip this part and only discuss the up-date process of . In order to maximize the objective func-tion, we compute the first-order partial derivatives for ! and based on Eq. (20) to obtain: and where Z is the derivative of the measures with respect to . This model calculates four scores iteratively. Suppose that we perform n iterations of updates for the scores, Z is: ! where ! ti , ! tr , ! bp and ! ls are weights for technological influence, technological richness, blocking power and patent legal scope, respectively.
We conduct experiments to validate our proposition that patent citations have legal and technological dimensions in interpretation and such distinctions can be useful for patent valuation. Specifically, we test whether the proposed patent quality measures (i.e., technological influence and richness, and blocking power and legal patent scope) can improve performance in predicting patent value. In this section, we first discuss our evaluation methodology (i.e., using patent renewal status as a proxy for patent valuation), then conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed quality measures on patent valuation at individual firms, and finally evaluate the overall performance of patents in Drug&amp;Medical as a whole.
To conduct an experimental evaluation on our proposition and proposal using patent valuation, we first need to have some ground truth for patent value. However, it is very difficult to obtain the monetary value of a large sample of patents. Thus, in our experiments, we use patent mainte-nance/renewal status as an indicator of patent value. After December 12, 1980, US patent holders have to pay main-tenance fees for granted patents. Thus, the patent holders need to decide whether to pay the maintenance fees to re-new and maintain their patent rights at the 4 th , 8 th and 12 th years after patent grant. Notice that the maintenance fees increase for later renewals. Thus, from the perspective of patent holders, it is intuitive that patent renewal status reflects patent values. For example, a patent that has only a 4 th year renewal is less valuable than another patent that is renewed at both the 4 th and the 8 th years. We assume that patent holders have significant insights about the true value of their patents and therefore use patent maintenance status as a proxy for patent value.

Formally, we define the time period from a patent X  X  grant date to its abandon/expiration date as its ActivePeriod (AP) . Given a patent p , AP p is either 4 years, 8 years, 12 years or more, based on how many times it gets renewed by the patent owner. Therefore, for a given patent p , we use three indicators for its value based on AP of p as follows. Feature Sets. We use some meta information in patents, including number of patent claims, number of patent in-dependent claims, number of patent inventors, patent U.S. class number, number of patent references, and number of patent citations, as the baseline features for evaluation of patent value. To validate our idea, we focus on the pro-posed four patent measures (quantified using our CiteCount, CiteNet, ProbCiteNet, and ProbCiteCount algorithms) as features for comparison. For a given patent, we compute the four proposed patent features at the year of patent grant, three years after patent grant, and six years after patent grant, respectively. Right after patent grant, the patent has yet received any citations so we only have information about its backward citations (the prior patents it cites). At the 3 year after patent grant, the patent has received some forward citations and thus the citation network is quite different. At the 6 th year after patent grant, we have more information about its forward citations and the citation network becomes even richer. Again, for different citation networks, we use patent quality measures derived by various algorithms to test whether our findings are robust across various citation networks at different points in time.
 Data Set and Experiment Setup. We conduct ex-periments using patents in the field of the Medical&amp;Drug, collected from the USPTO database, which contains rich text and bibliographic information of US patents. Complete patent maintenance information is also collected. We focus on patents granted between 1995 to 2000, since it takes 12 years to know if a patent has been renewed in all the three renewal decisions. The patent citation networks based on which we quantify the proposed patent quality measures in-volve more than 100,000 US patents.

We build up three binary classifiers for the three afore-mentioned binary indicators of patent value, C 1 , C 2 and C respectively. These classifiers identify patents of very low value (with an active period of smaller than 4 years) from the rest, patents of above-average value from those of below-average (whether the active period is greater or smaller than 8 years), and patents with high value (with an active pe-riod of a full patent life) from others, respectively. We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) , a widely used supervised learning model, to build up prediction models and perform a 5-fold cross validation on the data. The prediction accuracy is based on the average accuracy of the binary classifiers for training data in the 5-fold cross validation. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed features, we use oversampling techniques to construct a bal-anced data set where the numbers of maintained patents and abandoned patents are the same for each classifier.
In this section, we first evaluate the proposed quality mea-sures and algorithms in predicting patent value for individ-ual firms. We select the top five patent holders in the field of Drug&amp;Medical in terms of the number of their patents issued. This selection covers different types of firms, includ-ing pharmaceutical (Merck and Eli Lilly), chemicals (Poctor &amp; Gamble), medical devices (Medtronic), and academic in-stitutions (Regents of the Univ. of California). We analyze model parameters learned for each firm to gain insights in the importance of the four proposed quality measures in de-ciding patent value in firms. Moreover, we demonstrate and analyze the temporal patterns of decays of legal citations in Drug&amp;Medical.
 Data Description. Table 1 shows the maintenance infor-mation of the selected firms, where P Size is the number of patents held by each firm, while Exp. @4 th , Exp. @8 th , and Exp. @12 th represent the ratio of patents expiring at the 4 8 th and 12 th year, and Always Maintained represents the ratio of patents remaining maintained at the 12 th year.
Figure 1 shows the prediction results on patent value us-ing different feature sets for the selected firms. As shown, we test different combinations of features, with the four proposed patent features derived using different algorithms, based on (forward) citation information at different time points. The results show that incorporating our proposed features (by distinguishing legal and technological citations) into classifier does achieve significantly higher accuracy in predicting patent value than using only the baseline feature set. Recall that these five patent holders vary significantly in terms of their strategy in patent renewal, but our results are very robust across them.

Among the feature sets obtained using different algorithms, we observe that CiteNet achieves a better performance than CiteCount and ProbCiteNet outperforms ProbCiteCount. These results confirm our argument that mutual interdepen-dence and reinforcement between technological influence and richness as well as between legal blocking power and patent scope, which are ignored by the CiteCount and ProbCite-Count. Moreover, comparing the results of CiteCount versus ProbCiteCount and those of CiteNet versus ProbCiteNet , re-spectively, we can see that our proposed probabilistic model achieves a better performance. These results validate the mixture of technological and legal components in patent ci-tations, as we postulated, and the proposed temporal decay in legal citations.

The performance of ProbCiteNet is the best in predict-ing patent value. This suggests that by capturing both the probabilistic mixture of legal and technological citations in citation networks and the mutual interdependence among patent features, we can achieve the best performance. From the results, we can observe that given no forward citation in-formation, ProbCiteNet improves on the baseline model by 5 : 95% on average; with three year forward information, the improvement is 9 : 73%; and given six year forward citation information, an improvement of 10 : 71% on average.
Table 2 shows the learned importantce for different patent quality measures in the prediction model. These measures are derived from the ProCiteNet model based on the cita-tion networks at different time points, i.e., 0-year, 3-year and 6-year after patents are granted. All the importance for these measures is normalized to be between 0 and 1. Note that the importance of a measure reflects the extent of attention received from the patent holder in patent val-uation. If the learned predictive model of a company has the largest importance for blocking power, it may indicate Ex p. @8 th Exp @12 th A lways Maintained that the company tends to maintain patents that may block lots of subsequent patents. From the table, we observe that legal quality measures (instead of technological quality mea-sures) play a dominate role in deciding patent value for all the firms under examination, except for the time point when no forward citation is made. 4 In patent valuation, these top firms seem to be focused on the legal implication of their patents, which is an important reason for filing patents.
The parameter in the exponential decay function, used to model the temporal decay of legal citations in our proba-bilistic model, represents the speed of technological update in different fields and thus can provide insightful information about these fields. For example, if the technological change in a field is very fast, the techniques and products could be replaced quickly. As a result, a strategy for long-term legal blocking of subsequent inventions in such a field may not be effective as the market/competitors may lose interests in the techniques and products quickly.

To provide more insights, we look into the parameter to see if they reflect the speed of technological updates in fields. We select several major U.S. classes, including 424 (Drug, Bio-affecting and body treating compositions), 128
Th is is because the blocking power and technological in-fluence is 0, when there is no forward citation (thus it is meaningless to involve these two measures in comparisons under this scenario). (Surgery), 600 (Surgery) 5 and 435 (Chemistry: Molecular biology and microbiology) in Drug&amp;Medical for this analy-sis. Figure 2 plots the decay parameters for the aforemen-tioned classes of patents in each firm. The bars for a firm are the average decay parameters corresponding to the main-tenance decision at the patent grant date, 3-year after the patent grant, and 6-year after the patent grant, respectively. In each bar, the parameters of examined classes are sorted in descending order (from bottom to top). For example, in the first bar, the decay speed of U.S. Class 600 is the great-est and that of U.S. class 435 is the slowest. In Figure 2, we observe that Class 128 and Class 600 have relatively large decay speed, and Class 424 and Class 435 have relatively slow decay speed. Compared to surgery instruments (Class 128 and Class 600), drugs and inventions related to chem-istry in molecular biology and microbiology have a relatively slow turnover. This result is consistent with the notion that surgery instruments tend to have a faster product turnover and shorter life cycle, whereas drugs often have a longer life cycle due to the lengthy animal and clinical trials and the regulatory process. Moreover, Class 435 has the slowest de-cay speed. One possible reason is that inventions in this class might be related to some fundamentals in biology that could lead to drug discovery, thus having very slow speed of technological update.

After experimenting on firm-level patent valuation, here we aim to analyze how our proposed models perform on the whole set of patents in Drug&amp;Medical. Notice that since patent maintenance fees are paid by each company or orga-nization, we include patent assignee ID in the baseline fea-ture set to reduce the noise caused by varied maintenance strategies by different firms.
We show the prediction results for the three binary in-dicators of patent value using the proposed patent quality measures that are obtained from citation networks at var-ious time points (i.e., with no forward citation, 3 years of forward citations and 6 years of forward citations). From Figure 3, we can observe that the overall performance of ci-tation network-based algorithms outperforms those without considering the citation network structure, and using patent quality measures based on probabilistic mixture of techno-logical and legal citations better predicts the patent value. Moreover, the results obtained using different feature sets are consistent with the findings obtained in the firm-level patent valuation experiments (see Figure 1).

However, we can observe that the performance of the over-all prediction is not as good as that of patent valuation in individual firms. This is because the patent maintenance de-cisions are made by individual firms. Although we include the company ID in the baseline feature set, the training data, with patents from different firms, may not fit very well due to the varied maintenance strategies in different firms.
Nevertheless, the analysis on the importance of different patent quality measures still reveals the general pattern in deciding patent valuation in the field. From the learned model, we observe that the blocking power and patent legal scope still play dominating roles in determining patent value (with an average weight of 0.402 for blocking power, 0.327 for legal scope, 0.179 for technological influence, and 0.09 for technological richness).
Finally, we analyze the decay speed for different classes in the field of Drug&amp;Medical. We observe that the decay parameter (which reflects the speed of technology replace-ment) of U.S. class 600 (Surgery) is 0.67 on average, and U.S. class 435 (Chemistry: molecular biology and microbiology) has the smallest decay parameter (lowest decay speed) of 0.036, which is consistent with the results in firm-level patent evaluation (see Table 2) and our analysis in Section 4.2.3.
In this section, we review several research lines related to our work, including patent quality assessment, patent nov-elty detection, patent-relate decision recommendation, and prior art search.
 Patent Quality Assessment. Existing works assess patent quality from various aspects, including court ruling deci-sions [15, 14] and citation counts [19, 1, 4]. There are works in economics which examine the correlations between block-ing citations and patent value [4, 1]. Different from previ-ous work, we propose effective algorithms to capture patent quality measures based on distinguishing legal citations from technology citations.
 Patent Novelty Detection. Another line of works related to our project is patent novelty detection. Some existing works perform patent novelty detection by analyzing patent claims [9, 3] and calculating the age (the time difference between the first appearance of the word and the current timestamp) of important words in patent claims. Cluster-ing methods are also applied in patent novelty detection. In [17], documents are clustered by their word bags. A docu-ment is important if there are lots of work published after it and few works before it in the cluster. [11] ranks a patent based on the activeness of the topics in the patent along the time period.
 Patent Decision Recommendation. Different organiza-tions make different patent-related decisions. For a patent examiner, she needs to decide if to grant a patent; for a patent holder, it needs to make the patent maintenance deci-sion. An important line in patent data mining research is to make recommendations for different decision makings. [10] works on the problem of patentability prediction, i.e., to pre-dict if a patent will be granted. Using some extracted con-te xtual features (e.g., word frequency, word age and syntac-tic complexity), it makes recommendations for patentability decision. [12] works on patent maintenance recommenda-tions, by extracting a set of patent features (e.g., number of patent citations and patent writing quality) to make main-tenance recommendations.
 Patent Prior Arts Search. Another line of patent-related research is prior art search, which aims to assist inventors and examiners to find relevant patents by exploring similar-ity between the a given patent application and a set of candi-date patents or the citation relationships among patents [5, 18, 2]. Different strategies of enhancing prior art retriev-ability are studied, including using patent citation [18, 5], PageRank [16] or HITS [13] to improve recall, and formulat-ing the prior arts search problem as a citation recommenda-tion problem [5].
Patents are important assets for firms in the current knowl-edge economy, as they protect technologies and markets for patent holders. Therefore, it is crucial for companies to per-form effective patent valuation. Patent citations have been widely used in patent valuation. However, unlike paper cita-tions, patent citations not only reflect knowledge spreading but also carry legal implication. Based on this observation, we propose and develop algorithms to quantify four patent quality measures that distinguish legal citations from tech-nological citations. In our experiments, we use patent main-tenance as an indicator of patent value and predict patent maintenance status effectively. In particular, we propose an integrated process that puts together multiple models (in-cluding a temporal decay function on significance of legal citations, a probabilistic citation network based algorithm (ProbCitNet) and a prediction model for patent valuation) and learn the parameters in all these models together in an integrated fashion. Valuable insights, such as decay speed of different U.S. classes, and companies X  focus on legal as-pects versus technological aspects when it comes to patent evaluation, are found.

This is the first study that differentiates the two dimen-sions of patent citations and applies this notion to patent valuation. As such, this research points to many promis-ing subsequent research directions. It would be interest-ing to further study patent valuation in different fields, i.e, drug/biomedical versus information technologies to under-stand better how legal citations influence patent value. An-other challenge is to use various proxies to represent patent value, e.g., to identify the relation between legal citations and whether patents get licensed/sold or litigated.
