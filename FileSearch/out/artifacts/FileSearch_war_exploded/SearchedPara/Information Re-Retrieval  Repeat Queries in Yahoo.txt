 People often repeat Web searches, both to find new information on topics they have previously explored and to re-find information they have seen in the past. The query associated with a repeat search may differ from the initial query but can nonetheless lead to clicks on the same results. This paper explores repeat search behavior through the analysis of a one-year Web query log of 114 anonymous us ers and a separate controlled survey of an additional 119 volunteers. Our study demonstrates that as many as 40% of all queries are re-finding queries. Re-finding appears to be an important behavior for search engines to explicitly support, and we explore how this can be done. We demonstrate that changes to sear ch engine results can hinder re-finding, and provide a way to automatically detect repeat searches and predict repeat clicks. H3.3 [ Information storage and retrieval ]: Search and retrieval Measurement, Experiment ation, Human Factors. Query log analysis, Web search, re-finding, repeat queries. Thanks to the ubiquity of the In ternet search engine box, users have come to depend on Web s earch engines both to find new information and to re-find previ ously viewed information. A recent Pew Internet and American Life report showed that Internet searches are a top Inte rnet activity, second only to email [16]; in a study of Web users [9], 17% of those surveyed reported  X  X ot being able to return to a pa ge I once visited, X  as one of  X  X he biggest problems in using the Web. X  The effect of this is that knowledge workers are estimated to waste 15% of their time because they cannot find information that they know already exists [7]. Despite these know n problems, the use of keyword search engines for re-finding has not been significantly studied. While many searches are for new information, a significant use of search engines is to find inform ation that was found before. For example, a query or keyword is often used to  X  X ookmark X  a Web page. In this paper, we build on earlier work [21] to explore how keyword search is used for re-finding. We analyze the queries and result clicks of 114 anonym ous Yahoo users over the course of a year. Our analysis demonstrates that re-finding queries are common and provides a detailed characterization of them. Given the pervasiveness of re-finding queries, we explore which search engine features support or hinder re-finding. In particular, we concentrate on changes in rank a nd demonstrate the detrimental impact of rank changes on this type of task. Making use of our understanding of re-finding behavi or, we describe algorithmic methods to detect re-finding inte nt and suggest ways in which search engines can better support this behavior. Log studies like the one presented here are valuable because they give a large-scale, realistic picture of users X  actions. However, they give no insight into underlying motivation. To study re-finding through log analysis, it was necessary to try to glean from the data those queries which were intended to re-find information rather than find new informa tion. Re-finding intent was approximated by looking for repeat ed clicks on the same search result in response to queries issued by the same user at different times. The query used to re-find the result may or may not be the same as the query used to find it originally. For example, if a person searched with the query  X  X PCC Southern California Public Radio X  and clicked on th e result http://www.scpr.org, and then later clicked on the same result while searching for  X  X pcr X , the behavior was considered re-finding. Because of our limited ability to automatically distinguish re-finding from finding behavior in the query logs, our observations were supplemented with a separate additional controlle d experiment of a panel of 119 volunteers where a re-finding task was explicitly defined. No matter how re-finding is approxi mated in the logs, analysis reveals it is very common. Forty percent of all observed queries led to a click on a result that was also clicked during another query session by the same user, and nearly 30% of all URLs clicked in the data set were clicked by the same user more than once. As we will demonstrate, the impact of the interplay between this common behavior and changi ng result rankings has a cost in terms of session time. As a way of dealing with this problem, we discuss simple but effective ways to automatically detect re-finding queries and implications for search engine design. Re-finding behavior has recently attracted considerable interest [1, 3, 4, 6, 20, 21, 22]. Many re-finding studies have been limited to small-scale laboratory or interv iew based studies. Such studies of re-finding have consistently found that people tend to rely on meta-data about their target [6], for example, re-finding previously viewed content via known paths [4, 22]. Thus if someone originally encountered a piece of information via a search engine, that person is likely to try to repeat the same query to find that same information again. However, because people process encountered information to varying degrees, some re-finding may rely heavily on meta-data learned during the initial behavior than laboratory and obs ervational studies, and gives a very realistic picture of people X  X  actions, although it gives no insight into people X  X  underlying mo tivation. Log analysis has shown that Web site re-visitation is very common [5, 14, 19], with estimates of the portion of Web pa ge visits that are re-visits reaching up to 80% [5]. While many of these re-visitations occur shortly after the first visit ( e.g ., during the same session using the back button), a significant number occur after a considerable amount of time has elapsed. The re sults of Web site re-visitation studies have informed Web br owser history and back button functionality. While large-scale studies have been done on query logs (e.g., [10]), surprisingly, there has been little analysis of re-visitation and re-finding. These studies ha ve found that most queries are issued only once or twice. These results are particularly interesting when considered in li ght of our study, as we see that individuals are very likely to repeat queries. It is likely that many of the repeat queries seen by a search engine are repeated by the same individual(s). Some log analysis studies have looked at queries clustered by topic [2, 17, 24]. Several studies have investigated queries in aggregate over time, to understand changes in popularity [23] and uniqueness of query topics at diffe rent times of day [2]. Wedig and Madani showed that topics fo r a user are consistent over time and different from one a nother, and that some users repeat clicks over long time periods [24]. Others have analyzed queries over time for individuals, but focused on short periods of time such as query sessions [11, 13]. Sanderson and Dumais [18] c onfirmed re-finding behavior observed by us in previous work [21] and extended that work by examining temporal properties of repeated searches and clicks over a period of 90 days. They focused on the temporal aspects of repeat queries, finding, for ex ample, that navigational queries are repeated over longer periods of time than non-navigational queries. Our work is unique in that it looks at combinations of query and click patterns for a nonymous individuals over long time periods (one year). Because of the long time period studied we are able to characterize the different ways users express the repeat query intent and explore how they deal with result list changes. We analyzed search traces of que ries issued to the Yahoo search engine over a period of 365 days (August 1, 2004 to July 31, 2005) by 114 users. Search traces were considered for inclusion in the study if they included queries issued during at least four of the last ten days of the sample period. The average trace was 97 days long (see Figure 1). The study was conducted in accordance with Yahoo X  X  terms of service and privacy policy. All traces analyzed were strictly anonymous ; data was never used to match a search trace with an identity. Furthermore, results reported in this paper rely solely on aggregated statistics, and examples are purely illustrative. For the analysis described here, we focused primarily on the large majority of queries for which there was a click on a result page; we excluded next-page clicks, clicks on alternate query suggestions and instances where th ere was no click at all. The data were not filtered to remove search spam or robot/mechanical searches. Some of the strongest repeated-search repeated-click traffic may come from robots a nd how those may be detected based on re-finding behavior is briefly discussed later. In the analysis, we were not interested in very short-term query repetitions. Short-term repeat queries were most likely a result of page refreshes or back-button clic ks [14]. To remove short-term repeat queries from our data, we considered all instances of a query that occurred within thirty minutes of an identical query to be a single query. The threshold was chosen because there was a clear inflection in the data between the frequency at which searches were repeated before a nd after this point, suggesting that the observed behavior was different. We looked at the following information in our analysis: The query terms issued; an anonymous key distinguishing the user; the time the query was issued; what results were clicked and when; observed (an average of 115 per trace). The average query length (2.7 words), and average number of results clicked per result page was similar to what is reported elsewhere [10]. To successfully identify repeat queries in this data, it was necessary to associate queries by inferring the intent of the user, rather than relying on the exact query string being repeated. Many users repeated past query st rings perfectly (e.g.,  X  X bc world service X ). Of the 13,060 query instances, 4,256, or 33%, were an exact repeat of a query issued by the same anonymous user ID at another time. In contrast, only 860, or 7%, of all queries were issued by more than one user. Often, when identical queries occurred in the same trace, the user associated with the trace clicked on the same results following the identical query issuances. We also found a number of identical  X  X ennsylvania lottery X  and  X  X enns ylvania powerball X ). However, even identical queries did not guarantee a repeat click; it was quite common for repeat queries to lead to unique clicks. This section proposes a taxonomy of re peat queries, based on various combinations of query and click comparisons, and discusses their probable underlying intent. In defining the taxonomy we are Table 1 represents all possible cl assifications based on these two dimensions (query string a nd click-through sets). A number of the classes shown in Table 1 are very uncommon (e.g., queries for which there are multip le identical clicks). In this paper, we concentrate our e fforts on understanding the popular categories that are likely to include re-finding intent (bolded in Table 1). The broader the class of query captured by the category, the more likely it is to include both re-finding intent and other behaviors. By adding rest rictions, we reduce the number of false positives, and focus on instan ces with clear re-finding intent. Repeat clicks are a reasonable proxy for re-finding intent. Thus, we are interested in the cases where users clicked on the same results during two different query instances: 1. Overlapping-click queries  X  Queries that have some common Even assuming repeat clicks are a good representation for re-finding intent, overlapping-click que ries do not necessarily reflect re-finding exclusively. Users may explore new results as well as old in overlapping-click queries (broadening their search). Or they may not want to re-find everything they found initially, but rather to concentrate on more specific sets of results (narrowing). The category of equal-click queries is more restrictive: 2. Equal-click queries  X  The user clicks on the same results for While looking at click patterns is likely to give a relatively accurate picture of whether or not the user is re-finding, search engines generally do not know what their users are going to click on at the time a query is issued. For this reason, we consider equivalence and similarity in the query strings themselves. In the general case we can ignore the clic ks associated with each query. 3. Equal-query queries  X  The user issues the same query but Clearly, a combination of the two dimensions represents a very narrow, but precise, definition of re-finding intent: 4. Navigational queries  X  Queries where the user makes the Navigational queries, as defined above, tended to be for specific corporate Websites, and were likely part of a daily routine or at least daily life. By far the largest category of navigational queries contained searches for stor es or businesses. Seventy-five of the 3100 navigational queries (2.4%), contained the word  X  X ank X , presumably issued by users accessing online banking. Two other similarly sized cate gories of navigational queries contained the word  X  X ews X  (81/ 3100, 2.6%) and  X  X ail X  (80/3100, 2.6%). An interesting category of re-fi nding queries was defined by the entry of a URL, or a portion of a URL, in the search box. Of the 617 unique navigational query instances, 69 (11%) included  X .com X  in the query string. These represent 550 of the 3100 total navigational queries, or 18%. A lthough in many cases these users could have entered the URL into the navigation box instead of the search box, this is a very clear example of re-finding behavior that needs to be supported by the search engine. Currently browsers, search engine query boxes, and toolbars are designed to encourage navigationa l queries by supporting history-based auto-completion. This interface feature makes it very likely that a user attempting to re-find will issue duplicate query strings. Realistically, however, not all re-finding behavior is captured by repeat queries. For example, an additional 5% of queries (over the 24% of queries classified as navigational) contained different query strings that produced a single equivalent click (| C 1 but q 1  X  q 2 ). These queries are likely navigational in intent but do not fall under the navigational query category described above. Below we consider normalization functions (functions that render two queries normalization-equivalent ). These functions allow different queries with similar intent to be identified with each other. That is, even though q 1  X  q 2 , n( q 1 ) = n( q Query strings used to re-find can differ from their original forms in many ways. It has been shown that traditional vector space measures of similarity are gene rally unsuitable for finding query similarity [15]. To understand how to identify re-finding, we explored a number of potential differences between similar queries, enumerated in Table 2. Most of the differences listed are trivial to identify automatically, but some are not. Those that are starred  X  including abbreviations, synonyms, and reformulations  X  are not considered in our analysis for this reason. Note that normalization functions must be selected carefully because many queries that look si milar represent searches without any overlapping clicks and thus are likely to be searches for which there was no re-finding intent. There is an obvious trade-off between the precision of the queries matched and the recall. In order to find an appropriate query normalization function we began by concentrating on those queries that represent potential re-finding intent despite the query string being different. This class includes different query/singl e identical click (DQ-SIC) as well as the different query/overl apping click (DQ-OC) categories (see Table 1). The first category (DQ-SIC) is very likely to represent simple re-finding as the user travels directly to the same Webpage. The second category ( DQ-OC) contains more possible variation in query intent, but is interesting to explore because search engines should support co mplex re-finding behavior in addition to the simple single repeat click behavior. Previous work has identified over-lapping click queri es as likely to be related in meaning, and therefore useful for clustering queries [25]. To find the optimal normalization our system automatically tested all 2049 possible combinations of the 12 top transformations from Table 2 to find the minimal set of transformations that generated normalization-equivalence between each query pair. More than one transformation was often necessa ry to generate equivalence. For DQ-SIC queries we were unabl e to find a simple mapping for 112 of the 423 unique instances (26%). These queries tended to be very different. For example, topically related terms with no words in common could result in th e same click. Other queries required too many changes (e .g., abbreviations) and were considered failed inputs. Of the successful transformations, 111 (or 36% of 311) required the removal of one word (e.g.  X  X isney world X  and  X  X alt disney world X ). Similarly, 44 (14%) required a word to be swapped. Genera lly only one transformation was necessary to generate equivalent queries (79%). For the unique DQ-OC queries, 142 of the 413 unique DQ-OC instances (34%) could not be normalized. Overlapping clicks are likely related to the distinctness of the query strings, as suggested by our difficulty normalizing DC-OC queries. The more distinct two queries are, the more likely they are to generate distinct result sets. We also find a higher incidence of word swapping (68/276 or 25%) and word removal (132/276 or 48%) in the case of DQ-OC than for DQ-SIC. Likewise, only 180 queries (65% of 276) could be normalized with only one step, a drop from the DQ-SIC case. Unsurprisingly, the lesson from this analysis is that queries which are exact or near repeats of previous queries are more likely to generate the exact same clicks as before. Although such patterns observed in the logs imply re-finding intent, the intent is never explicit. To further explore query normalization we initiated a cont rolled study of volunteers doing an explicit re-finding task. The re sults, described below, allow us to further sharpen our understandi ng of re-finding and serve as a useful comparison to the log study. To better understand how people remember past queries, we analyzed the data collected th rough a separate university-based small-scale study where volunteer participants were asked to issue a self-selected query and interact with the search results as they normally would. After an interval of a half hour to an hour, participants were emailed a brief survey that asked them to remember the query they issued without referring back to it. The results of this study give insight into how easy it is to remember past queries and how likely people are to remember them. One hundred and nineteen people participated in the study. Of those, 52% demographically self-i dentified as male, and 45% as female. Sixty four percent reported being aged 25 to 39, 18% over 40, and 15% under 25. Almo st all (97%) reported using a computer daily. In general the follow-up survey was completed within a couple of hours of the initial search. Sixty-nine percent of all survey responses were r eceived within three hours of the initial search, and all but five were received within a day. The average initial query length was 3.2 words, again, comparable to previous work [10]. Even though the elapsed time between a participant X  X  initial query and the moment when he or she was asked to remember it was relatively short, the original query was misremembered 30% of the time (36 of 119 query pairs). We applied the same combinatorial analysis to the data collected through this study as we did to the query logs. Of the 36 misremembered queries, 27 (or 75%), were found to be equivalent after some normalizations. Th e nine remaining query pairs appear to have arisen from participants summarizing their previous queries instead of repea ting them (e.g.,  X  X hats the best pricing available for a Honda Pilot or Accura MDX ? X   X   X  X est pricing for Accura MDX X ). Of the 27 that were normalization-equivalent, case normalization was needed in 12 cases (or 44%). In 9 of the 27 (33%), stemming of individual terms was necessary. In a full 30% (8/27) one word was substituted. For some this was due to misspellings (e.g.,  X  X elment X  instead of  X  X elmet X ), and for others it was due to the use of synonyms (e.g.,  X  X here might I find... X  versus  X  X here can I find... X ). Interestingly, only four query pairs of the 27 (14%) were normalized by removal of a word. This is in contrast to the 36% in the log study (DQ-SIC case). Sixteen queries (or 59% of the 27) required more than one normalization step (e.g., word order and stop word removal). The six most effective normaliza tions for our experiments are shown in Table 3. One notable difference between the two data sets is that the log contained many more instances of duplicate words and word ordering changes. There are a number of reasons why the anonymous log and c ontrolled volunteer studies may differ. In particular, there was a significant difference in elapsed time between queries for the two studies. The average time between overlapping-click queries in the logs is over 12.2 days (292 hours) with a median of 30 hours. This longer interval presents many more opportunities for users to forget or change their queries. However, in the log study users often had the opportunity to learn effective querying for frequently sought information. Many log queries we re issued more than twice and likely to be more memorable as a result. The controlled study was biased towards queries being memorable in that participants knew they were participating in a study, and against it in that the recall event was prompted by an email rather than self-directed. Because navigational queries were prevalent, we explored their frequency and significance for indivi dual users. Of the 114 users, 102 issued at least one equal-query query, and 87 (76%) performed at least one navigati onal query. Fifteen had equal-query queries but no navigationa l queries, possibly indicating they were explorers [26]. If we remove the bottom 25th percentile of users who issued th e fewest queries (those issuing under 19 queries) we find that 76 (88%) of 86 have issued at least one navigational query (the dist ribution of these is shown in Figure 2). Of the 87 users performing naviga tional queries, the median user issued 3 unique navigational queries. The average user issued 7.6 unique navigational queries (alt hough removing one user, with a remarkable 103 unique navigational queries, decreases the average to 6.5 unique navigational queries). Considering those users who have issued naviga tional queries we find that on average ~10% of those users X  unique queries are navigational (median of 6%). This distributi on is depicted in Figure 3. Analysis of individual behavior ma y lend itself to the detection of robots and search engine optimizer s. Users with many regularly spaced navigational queries are possibly using an automated system. For example, one trace contained 50 navigational queries in 52 visits (96.2%); another contained 334 navigational queries out of 417 total queries (80.1%). While it is clear from this analysis that not all users issue many re-finding queries, nearly all issue some and for many this is a significant portion of their query behavior. Given the prevalence of re-finding queries, it is important to understand which search engine features help and which negatively impact the user X  X  re-fi nding objective. Search engines are constantly attempting to improve results through the discovery of new resources and the creati on of new ranking strategies. While this benefits users who are looking for the best new information, the rank change of pr eviously viewed search results can adversely impact those users attempting to re-find. Since the queries in our logs occurred over a sufficient period of time for the results to change in res ponse to repeated queries, it was possible to observe to what extent changes to search result ranking affected the users X  ability to re-find information. We found that when a previously clicked result changed position, users were less likely to re-clic k results. This suggests that changes to result ordering caused people to re-find less information and view more new information. This is not necessarily a bad thing if the new information is better than the old. However, users frequently w ould like to find the same result, as evidenced by the significant number of navigational queries. More critically, we observed that when the searcher clicked on a previously viewed result, the time it took to make the click was significantly longer if the rank of the result had changed in the meantime. This suggests that changing the rank of a result can lead to noticeable changes in user behavior; whether or not such changes are beneficial to the user should be considered carefully. To understand how a change in a result X  X  rank affected click behavior, we looked at how likel y a result was to be clicked again. Because the dataset did not contain results that were not clicked, we were only able to id entify result lists that had changed when we observed rank changes am ong clicked results for queries with overlapping-clicks. A bette r understanding could be derived from a knowledge of which results were displayed, even if not clicked. We looked at all queries that had overlapping-clicks. We compared the probability that any given click would be a repeat click for these queries under two conditions: (i) when a change in rank was observed among one of th e overlapping clicks and (ii) where no rank change was observed. We found that it was much more likely for a repeat result to be clicked if there was no change in rank: 88% percent of the clicks for overlapping-click queries were repeat clicks if there was no change in rank, while only 53% of the clicks were repeat clicks if there was a change in rank. These estimates were obtained by averaging all consecutive pairs of overlapping-click queries. Figure 4 shows the probability that a clicked result was a repeat click as a function of the order in which the click occurs following a repeat overlapping-click query. The dashed curve corresponds to the probability aver aged over those searches where no rank change was observed; the solid curve corresponds to an average where at least one result changed rank. Comparing the two curves, we see that a change in rank between queries makes it substantially less likely that a given result will be clicked on again during a follow-up search. Also in Figure 4 we see a sharp drop in the probability of a repeat click between the first result and the second. Given that a finite number of results were clicked initially, it seems reasonable that if the user first clicks on repeat results then the probability of a repeat click would tend to drop w ith increasing numbers of clicks, as the user exhausts the set of previously-clicked results. The drop continues past click two when restricted to clicks on results with rank changes, which would seem to indicate that users are more likely to click on new results as they continue to interact with the result list than they ar e to click on previously clicked results which have changed rank. It is not immediately obvious from this analysis whether a decreased likelihood of re-finding reflects a positive or negative influence of result list changes on user experience. It could be that the changes interfered with re-finding, or it could be that the searcher found new and better information in the new result set. To get a better idea of whether ch anges interfered with re-finding, we looked at queries where we we re certain that information was being re-found, as evidenced by a repeat click. Because easy searches are likely to take less time than harder searches, we looked at the time interval betw een a search and a click on a result that was seen before. For this reason, we measured the time from when a query was issued until the common URL was clicked for different-query, overlapping click queries. Table 4 shows the average number of seconds it took to click a URL that was clicked during the initial session when that URL was (i) shown at the same rank it originally appeared, and (ii) shown at a different rank. If the rank of the result had not in search [7, 8] is that users pay more attention to early-ranked items. Thus, if a previously clic ked on result moves up, it is more easily re-found via a visual scan. In the future, we hope to statistically confirm these findi ngs by using longer traces. A potentially desirable search engine behavior, given the impact of rank changes, is to impose more stability on the results returned by searches where re-finding is deemed to be the intent. To do this, it is necessary to quickly and accurately classify queries to determine the best re sults for a given user given re-finding intent. This section looks at predicting whether a previously viewed result will be clicked based on the query string and past clicks. Repeat searchers may be looking for new information, or they may want information that they ha ve seen before. It was most common to look for the same in formation: approximately 87% (3692/4256) of equal-query queries were also overlapping-click queries. Fewer queries (1632 or 38%) resulted in at least one unique click. Searchers did not always want only old or only new information when they issued equal-query queries, as 25% of the queries, or 1070, involved both a rep eat click and a unique click. This section begins by looking at the effect that elapsed time and number of previous clicks have on repeat queries. Navigational queries are particularly easy to predict, and they are discussed in greater detail, as are other query types. We looked at how the elapsed time between equal-query queries affected the likelihood of observing a repeat click. The probability of a repeat click as a function of elapsed time between identical queries can be seen in Figure 5. Repeat queries that were issued very close together in time (e.g., within several hours) had a relatively low probability of resulting in a repeat click. The probability of a repeat click for que ries re-issued within an hour is 64%, compared with the earlier reported overall average of 87%. Queries repeated very quickly probably occurred as part of the same search session, and represent instances where the user was looking for something new. The probability of repeat clicks climbs quickly, however, for intervals longer than a day or tw o. Once it reaches a peak, the probability of a repeat click between identical queries slowly declines. This may represent a trend to forget previously seen information over time. We found we were able to accurately predict the likelihood of a repeat click based on a history of clicked results from past queries. Navigational queries were particularly easy to predict. Recall that navigational queries are equal-query queries where the user clicked on the same result for each query instance and did not click on any other results. Us ing this definition, 507 (or 47%) of all unique equal-query que ries issued were labeled navigational. Navigational queries tended to be somewhat shorter in length than other queries (13.6 characters, compared with 16.4 characters for non-navigational equal-query que ries and 16.7 characters for overlapping-click queries). This seems reasonable because navigational queries are probably intended to be an easy way to return to a Web page, and thus should be short and easy to remember. Navigational queries we re also more likely to include an indication that they were a search for a URL: 12% of all navigational queries contained  X . com X ,  X .edu X , or  X .net X , as opposed to only 5% of non-navigational equal-query queries. Navigational queries were also re peated more often than other repeat queries (4.0 times, comp ared with 3.8 for equal-query queries and 3.3 for overlapping-c lick queries) and, as found by Sanders and Dumais [18], the interval between navigational queries was longer (22 days, compared with 20 days and 16 for equal-query and overlapping-click queries respectively). It is likely that navigational queries occurred more often because they are more of an access than a search strategy, and people tend to access more than search. The longer intervals are probably because the queries are probably chosen to be particularly memorable even across long periods of time. It was easy to predict whether a query was navigational given two previous instances of the same query as training data. By doing this, we were able to automatically classify 1841, or 12%, of all observed searches on the fly as navigational. For these searches, we could predict with 96% accuracy one of the URLs clicked. When restricted to predicting the first URL clicked, accuracy only dropped slightly, to 95%, and if predicting that only that URL was clicked, accuracy dropped slightly more, to 94%. It was less easy to identify a na vigational query using only one previous query. While doing so cove rs more of the data (2955, or 23%, of the searches), the prediction was right only 87% of the time. Given 87% of all equal-query queries involve overlapping clicks, it is not at all surprising that we can predict exactly which result will be clicked 87% of the time given we know the user only clicked one result before. We also investigated whether it was possible to predict whether a user was going to click on new or repeat results for equal-query queries that were not navigational. Using features suggested by the earlier analysis presented in this paper, such as elapsed time, query length, and number of results clicked previously, we trained an SVM (http://www.cs.cornell.e du/People/tj/svm_light/) to predict two outcomes: (i) whethe r or not a new result would be clicked, and (ii) whether or not a repeat result would be clicked. The strongest predictors for a click on a new result included the number of times the query was issued previously (and if it was issued more than once before), whether any previously viewed result was clicked more than once, and several features that were the same for queries that were repeated only twice:  X  Number of clicks the first time the query was issued  X  Number of clicks the previous time the query was issued  X  Number of unique clicks the previous time While no correlation was found betw een the number of clicks and the likelihood of a repeat click, gi ven the value of these features in predicting new clicks it seems it is indicative of a new click. The strongest predictors for a repeat click were a) that only one result was clicked during the previous search, and b) that the query had been issued more than once. These features are also useful for identifying navigational queries, which experience a high incidence of repeat queries (although queries identified as navigational queries were ex cluded from this analysis). Using the features described above, and leave-one-out cross-validation, we compared the ability of the SVM to predict whether a new result or a unique re sult would be clicked. As our baseline we used the accuracy that could be expected if people were always assumed not to click on something new (61.4% accuracy) and to click on something they clicked before (74.7% accuracy). In both cases, we found the SVM was able to make a significantly ( p &lt;0.01) better prediction at 79.3% accuracy for new clicks (an increase of 30%), a nd 78.1% for repeat clicks (an increase of 5%). The SVM probably does a better job predicting new clicks than old because the navigational query data, which was the most easily identifiable repeat click data, was excluded. We also looked at including the user as a feature in the learning. While this led to a slight im provement in both cases (80.1% accuracy in predicting new clicks and 79.4% accuracy in predicting repeat clicks), the difference was not significant. However, we suspect that users do exhibit distinct repeat and new click behaviors, and we probabl y need to accumulate additional features that will allow us to capture this distinction. The findings presented in this pa per have many ramifications for search engine design, and poten tially for browsers and search toolbars. Re-finding, or searching for previously found information, represents a significan t fraction of user behavior. Traditionally, search engines have focused on returning search results without consideration of th e user X  X  past query history, but the results of the log study suggest it might be a good idea for them to do otherwise. Alt hough finding and re-finding tasks may require different strategies, tool s will need to seamlessly support both activities. As shown in the log analysis, people often clicked on both old and new results during the same search. Because people repeat queries so frequently, search engines should assist their users by providing a means of keeping a record of individual users' search historie s, perhaps via software installed on the user's own machine. A num ber of search history designs have been explored (e.g., [12]). The results of the log study indicate it is important to account for individual differences in how people repeat queries. For ex ample, different users made use of repeat queries at different ra tes, and may benefit from having a different amount of screen real es tate devoted to displaying their search history. Furthermore, sear ch histories could be customized based on many factors including the time of day. Users with a large number of navigational queri es may also benefit from the direct linking to the Webpage (po ssibly labeled with the frequent query term). This form of shor tcut could be highly effective for many in terms of rapid access to information. While a user may simultaneously have a finding and re-finding intent when searching, satisfying both needs may be in conflict. Finding new information means be ing returned the best new information, while re-finding means being returned the previously viewed information. We found that when previously viewed search results changed to include new information, the searcher X  X  ability to re-find was hampered. It is important to consider how the two search modalities can be r econciled so a user can interact with new, and previously seen, in formation. As Teevan [20] has previously proposed, before informa tion is allowed to change, it is important to understand which aspects of it that a person has already interacted with are memorable. Despite the personal nature of re-fi nding, it is possible that repeat queries from one user could bene fit another. For example, popular results for navigational queri es could be globally elevated by the search engine for the benefit of everyone. While desirable in theory, in practice this may encourage search engine spam. In contrast, personalizing search resu lts based on search history can help avoid potential problems caused by spam. In this paper, we looked at the que ries issued to a leading Internet search engine in 114 user search traces over the course of a year, and studied 119 users in a separa te university-based controlled experiment with volunteers. We observed that repeat searches and repeat clicks were very co mmon. We found it was possible to predict which queries were navi gational and what results were likely to be clicked. Changing the rank of a previously clicked result appears to hinder re-finding, so click predictions should be used carefully by search engines to customize search results in a manner consistent with the user X  X  search habits. We are currently continuing work in this area with a larger set of users. In particular we are interested in further analyzing repeat queries for individual users and broader noti ons of repetition (e.g., repeating query chains, or co-occurrences of queries in time). We are also pursuing an understanding of user behavior during the potentially iterative process of refining a query for re-finding tasks. [1] Aula, A., Jhaveri, N., and K X ki, M.
