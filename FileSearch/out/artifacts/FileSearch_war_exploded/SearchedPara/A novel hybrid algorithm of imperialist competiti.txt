 fi  X  1. Introduction
The problem of OPF has been in the focus of wide attention over past years and has established its position as one of the main tools for optimal operation and planning of modern power systems. Main objective of the OPF problem is to optimize a chosen objective function such as piecewise quadratic cost func-tion, fuel cost with valve point effects, fuel cost with prohibited zones, or fuel cost with voltage pro fi le improvement by optimal adjusting the power system control variables and satisfying various system operating such as power fl ow equations and inequality constraints, simultaneously ( Niknam et al., 2011 ;
Sayah and Zehar, 2008 ). OPF problem is one of them which help the operators in running the system optimally under speci constraints. In order to guide the decision making of power system operators a more robust and global optimization of any OPF problems is needed.

Nodal power balance equations and restrictions of all control or state variables are examples of equality constraints and inequality constraints, respectively. The control variables include the tap ratios of transformer, the generator real powers, the generator bus voltages and the reactive power generations of VAR sources while state variables involve the generator reactive power outputs, load bus voltages and fl ow of the network lines. Accordingly, the
OPF problem is considered a basic tool allowing electric utilities to characterize secure and cost effective operating conditions for an electric power system ( He et al., 2004 ; Dommel and Tinney, 1968 ).
In general view, the OPF problem is described as a highly constrained, large-scale non-linear non-convex optimization pro-blem. Dommel and Tinney (1968) were the fi rst authors to introduce the formulation of the OPF problem. From then, this topic has been handled by many researchers. Generally, the OPF problem can be solved via many traditional optimization methods such as linear programming (LP), non-linear programming (NLP), quadratic programming (QP), Newton-based techniques and interior point methods (IPM) ( Yan and Quantana, 1999 ;
Habiabollahzadeh et al., 1989 ; Burchet et al., 1984 ; Momoh et al., 1999 ; Momoh 1999 ; Huneault and Galina,1991 ). However, in some cases, the foregoing methods failed to provide the global minima and only reached the local one. Therefore, some classical methods cannot handle the integer problems. To guide the decision making of the power system operator, the OPF solution should not be sensitive to selected starting points. Complexity of OPF problem must be reduced. OPF problem programs must be user friendly. Therefore, there is a need for more robust and faster OPF algorithm. With regard to this, improvement of optimization methods, capable of address these shortcomings are becoming increasingly vital ( Roy et al., 2010 ).

In recent decades, various population-based optimization tech-niques have been applied to solve complex constrained optimiza-tion problem which also include optimization problem in fi of power systems like economic dispatch, optimal reactive power fl ow and OPF. Generally, achieving optimal or near optimal solution for a speci fi c problem will require multiple trials as well as accurate adjustment of associated parameters. Some of the proposed population-based methods such as tabu search (TS) ( Abido, 2002 ), genetic algorithm (GA) ( Deveraj and Yegnanarayana, 2005 ), improved genetic algorithm (IGA) ( Lai et al., 1997 ), particle swarm optimization (PSO) ( Abido, 2002 ), differential evolution (DE) ( Varadarajan and Swarup, 2008 ), simu-lated annealing (SA) ( Roa-Sepulveda and Pavez-Lazo, 2003 ), evo-lutionary programming (EP) ( Somasundaram et al., 2004 ), a multi-objective PSO ( Hazra and Sinha, 2010 ), fuzzy multi-objective PSO considering UPFC ( Aghaei et al., 2012 ), modi fi ed honey bee mating optimization (MHBMO) considering generator constraints ( Niknam et al., 2011 ), modi fi ed arti fi cial bee colony (MABC) algorithm ( Khorsandi et al., 2013 ), and improved harmony search (IHS) algorithm ( Sinsuphan et al., 2013 ) have proved to be successful in solving OPF problem with different objectives. The results reported were for different test systems promising and encouraging for further research in this direction.

The power system academic has made considerable efforts to provide scienti fi c community with simulation tools that cover different aspects of power systems analysis. Matpower developed by Zimmerman and Gan (1997) , Power Systems Analysis Toolbox (PSAT) introduced by Milano (2005) and utilized enhanced genetic algorithm (EGA) for solving OPF by Bakistzis et al. (2002) are some examples of these efforts. The mentioned approaches have been tested on IEEE 30-bus system and the three areas IEEE RTS-96 which is a 73 bus, 120-branch system.

Another approach to OPF problem was DE algorithm intro-duced by Basu with use of fl exible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices. Basu used multi-objective DE algorithm to solve the OPF problem with FACTS devices in IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems, the results were compared with the literature by the author ( Basu, 2011 ). Madhad et al. also investigated use of ef fi cient parallel genetic algorithm (EPGA) in the OPF problem representing large-scale system with shunts FACTS devices. Authors presented three test systems IEEE 30-bus, IEEE 118-bus and 15 generation units with prohibited zones and compared with the results of other literatures ( Madhad et al., 2010 ).
Atashpaz-Gargari and Lucas (2007) introduced a novel with inspiration from social and political relations. The performance of this evolutionary optimization algorithm has been continuously reinstated by successful utilization in many engineering applica-et al., 2011 ), and industrial engineering ( Nazari-Shirkouhi et al., 2010 ) in recent years and has demonstrated great effectiveness in both critical factors of convergence rate and capability in achieving global optimal. In Bahrami et al. (2011) a new modi fi ed ICA method further has been improved the performance of ICA algorithm by taking advantage of chaotic maps to determine the movement angle of colonies towards imperialist  X  s position in order to enhance the escaping capability from a local optimal trap. In this paper, we present a new hybrid algorithm, called a MICA  X  TLA, which is based on merging MICA with TLA algorithms.
The performance of this approach for OPF problem with non-smooth cost functions such as piecewise quadratic cost function, studied and evaluated on the standard IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus test systems with different objective functions and is compared to methods reported in the literature. Experimental results on the OPF problem show that the novel hybrid algorithm has better performance in both convergence and global best, compared with original ICA, TLA, MICA, and other methods reported in the literature. We believe that the proposed method has good performance and ability to obtain the solution of the OPF problem. This proposed method can optimize number of different objectives and may be helpful to the system operators in choosing judicious decision in running the system ef fi ciently. The rest of this paper is classi fi ed into four sections as follows:
Section 2 covers formulation of an OPF problem while Section 3 explains the standard structure of the ICA, TLA, MICA and hybrid
MICA  X  TLA algorithms, Section 4 of the paper is allocated to presenting optimization results and undertaking comparison and analysis of the performance of the mentioned methods used to solve the case studies of OPF problem on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems and fi nally, in Section 5 , the conclusion of the implementation for the hybrid method is presented. 2. Problem formulation
In general view, the goal of a solution of optimal power fl problem is to optimize a selected objective function through optimal adjustment power system control parameters while satisfying equality and inequality constraints at the same time. The OPF problem can be mathematically formulated as follows: Min J  X  x ; u  X  X  1  X 
Subject to : g  X  x ; u  X  X  0  X  2  X  h  X  x ; u  X  r 0  X  3  X 
In the above equation, J is the objective function to be mini-mized and x is the vector of dependent variables (state vector) consisting of: 1. Generator active power output at slack bus P G1 . 2. Load bus voltage V L . 3. Generator reactive power output Q G . 4. Transmission line loading (or line fl ow) S l .

Accordingly, the x vector can be illustrated as the following: x where NG de fi nes the number of generators; NPQ and NTL depict the number of PQ buses and the number of transmission lines, respectively. u is the vector of independent variables (control variables) consisting of: 1. Generation bus voltages V G . 2. Generator active power output P G at PV buses except at the slack bus P G1 . 3. Transformer taps settings T . 4. Shunt VAR compensation Q C .

Therefore, u can be expressed as follows: u where NT and NC represent the number of tap regulating trans-formers and number of shunt VAR compensators, respectively. 2.1. Constraints 2.1.1. Equality constraints
In the below terms, g is the equality constraints, illustrating typical load fl ow equations ( Dommel and Tinney, 1968 ): P Q is the number of buses, P Gi is the active power generation, Q the reactive power generation, P Di is the active load demand, Q the reactive load demand, G ij , B ij and  X  ij are the conductance, susceptance and phase difference of voltages between bus i and bus j , respectively. 2.1.2. Inequality constraints h is the inequality constraints that include: (i) Generator related constraints: generation bus voltages, active power outputs, and reactive power outputs are restricted by their lower and upper limits as follows: where V min Gi and V max Gi are the minimum and maximum generator voltage of i th generating unit; P min Gi and P the minimum and maximum active power output of i th generating unit and Q min Gi and Q max Gi are the minimum and maximum reactive power output of i th generating unit. (ii) Transformer limitations: transformer tap settings are restric-ted by their lower and upper limits as follows:
T min i r T i r T max i ; i  X  1 ; ... ; NT  X  9  X  where T min i and T max i de fi ne minimum and maximum tap settings limits of i th transformer. (iii) Shunt VAR compensator constraints: shunt VAR compensa-tions are restricted by their limits as follows: where Q min Ci and Q max Ci de fi ne minimum and maximum VAR injection limits of i th shunt compensator. (iv) Security constraints: include the constraints of voltages at load buses and transmission line loading as follows:
S li r S max li ; i  X  1 ; ... ; NTL  X  12  X  where V min Li and V max Li are the minimum and maximum load voltage of i th unit. S li de fi nes apparent power fl ow of i th branch. S max li de fi nes maximum apparent power fl ow limit of i th branch.

It is worth mentioning that the control variables are self-constrained. The hard inequalities of P G1 , V L , Q G , and S incorporated in the objective function as quadratic penalty terms.
Therefore, the objective function can be augmented as follows ( Sayah and Zehar, 2008 ):
J  X   X   X  where  X  P ,  X  V ,  X  Q and  X  S are de fi ned as penalty factors. x limit value of the dependent variable x and given as follows: x 3. Proposed hybrid algorithm 3.1. ICA
ICA ( Atashpaz-Gargari and Lucas, 2007 ) is purposed for general searching that is inspired from imperialistic competition in geo-political interactions between countries. Fig. 1 shows the chart of the ICA. Generally, this algorithm starts with an initial population. Each individual of the population is called as a  X  country  X  . The countries in the population with the minimum cost (equal with elites in GA) are selected to be the imperialist states and the rest countries form the colonies of these imperialists. Then imperialistic competitions among these empires form the basis of the ICA. The imperialist states together with their colonies form empires. Imperialistic competitions converge to a state in which only one empire remains and its colonies are in the same position and have the same cost as the imperialist. Note that the power of each country is inversely proportional to its cost. 3.1.1. Generating initial empires
The goal of optimization is to determine an optimal solution in form of the problem variables. The algorithm-user creates an array of variable values which are desired to be optimized. In the ICA terminology, this array is called as a  X  country  X  (equal with mosome  X  in GA). It is clearly fi gured out that when solving an N dimensional optimization problem, a country is a 1 N var array. This country is de fi ned as follows: country  X  X  P 1 ; P 2 ; P 3 ; ... ; P N var  X  15  X  where P i s are considered as the variables that should be optimized.
The candidate solutions of the problem, called country, include a combination of some socio-political characteristics such as, welfare, culture, religion and language. Fig. 2 shows the inter-pretation of country using some of socio-political characteristics.
When the problem is optimized, the optimal solution is the maximum power (minimum cost). By evaluating the cost function, found (Eq. (16) ): cost i  X  f  X  country  X  X  f  X  P 1 ; P 2 ; P 3 ; ... ; P N var In the fi rst step of the algorithm, the initial population of size N country is produced. N imp is selected from the strongest population in order to form the empires. The remaining N col of the population will form the colonies which are under control of one of the empires. Some of these colonies are given to each imperialist for dividing the early colonies among the imperialist according to their power. To proportionally divide the colonies among imperialists, the normalized cost of an imperialist is explained as follows: C n  X  max i f c i g c n  X  17  X  In the above mentioned equation, c n is de fi ned as the cost of n th imperialist and C n is its normalized cost. When the normalized costs of all imperialists are gathered, the normalized power of each imperialist is evaluated according to the following equation: P  X  C n The initial colonies are distributed among empires based on their power. Accordingly, initial number of colonies for n th empire will be: NC n  X  round f P n U N col g X  19  X  where NC n factor represents the initial number of colonies of the empire and N col is the total number of existing colonies countries in the initial countries crowds. 3.1.2. Absorption policy modeling
As it was explained in previous subsection, imperialist states force their colonies to move toward themselves along different socio-political axis such as welfare and culture. Actually, the central government attempts to close colony country to its own imperialist by applying attraction policy, in different political and social dimensions, with considering showing manner of country in solving optimization problem. Fig. 3 illustrates this movement in which a colony moves toward the imperialist by units.
In Fig. 3 , d and x variables present distance between imperialist and colony countries and accidental number with steady distribu-tion, respectively.

Therefore, x can be de fi ned as follows: x U  X  0 ;  X  d  X  X  20  X  where  X  is a number greater than one and nears to two. A good selection can be  X   X  2. A random amount of deviation is added to the direction of movement in order to increase the ability of searching more area around the imperialist. In Fig. 3 ,  X  parameter with uniform distribution. Then:  X  U  X   X  ;  X   X   X  X  21  X  where  X  is an ideal parameter that its growth causes increase in searching area around imperialist and reduction of its value causes colonies close possibly to the vector of connecting colony to the imperialist. In most of implementations, the value of  X  is arbitrary and about  X  /4 (Rad). 3.1.3. Position displacement of colony and imperialist
If a colony reaches a better point than an imperialist in its movement towards the imperialist country (equal to having more power than the country), it will replace that imperialist country.
Causing the algorithm to continue with an imperialist country in new location and in this time it is the new imperialist country in which begins to applying assimilation policy for its colonies. 3.1.4. Total power of an empire
The sum power of an empire is mainly under in fl uence of the power of imperialist country. However, the power of the colonies of an empire also has a negligible effect on the sum power of that empire. Taking into account the both above mentioned factors affecting the power of the empire, the sum cost of an empire calculates as follow:
TC n  X  cost  X  imperialist n  X  X  where TC n is de fi ned as the total cost of the n th empire and positive number that has value between zero and one and near to zero. A low value for  X  results in calculation of total power of the empire solely by the power of imperialist, and growth of it will increase the share of the colonies in determining the total power of an empire. The value of 0.15 for  X  has shown good balanced results in most of the implementations. 3.1.5. Imperialistic competitions
There has always been a race among the empires to expand their territory by taking control and hold each other  X  s colonies.
The imperialistic competition in this algorithm is modeled by the above fact and works by just picking some (usually one) of the weakest colonies of the weakest empire and making a competition among all empires to possess these (this) colonies. In this competition, each of the empires will have a certain probability of taking possession of the mentioned colonies relative to their total power. These weakest colonies will not de fi nitely be possessed by the most powerful empires, but these empires will be more likely to control them.

In the fi rst step of modeling of the competition between the empires for possessing these colonies, the weakest empire is selected and then the possession probability of each empire ( P is estimated proportional to the total power of the empire. The normalized total cost of an empire is determined by the following:
NTC  X  max where TC n is total cost of n th empire and NTC n is normalized cost of that n th empire. By having the normalized total cost, the possession probability of each empire is de fi ned by:
P  X  NTC n In next part, the mentioned colonies will be divided accidentally between the empires with a certain probability which is related to ownership probability of each empire. In order to divide the given colonies among the empires, vector P is formed as follows:
After that, the vector R should be de fi ned with the same size of vector P . The arrays of this vector are accidental number with the same distribution in [0, 1].
 R  X  X  r 1 ; r 2 ; r 3 ; ... ; r N imp  X  26  X  Then, vector D is constructed by subtracting R from P .
D  X  P R  X  X  D 1 ; D 2 ; D 3 ; ... ; D N imp  X  X  p p We give the mentioned colonies to the empires with having vector D so that related index in vector D is bigger than others.
The imperialistic competition will gradually result in a growth of the power of great empires and a decline in the power of weaker ones. The weak empires will slowly lose their power and getting weakened by the time. 3.2. MICA
In the main ICA, only the absorption policies, applied by the imperialist countries against their colonies are modeled. However, in real geopolitical interactions between countries, the imperialist countries themselves will also move towards the most powerful imperialist countries on different economic, political and social axis which they see themselves weak.

Even at some points, the af fi liated imperialists will overtake the greater imperialist in this axis and its power will be increased as the result. Of course they do not always succeed or will face some resistance. But this interaction will force inevitable changes on geopolitical status of imperialist countries and as a result of that, force changes on absorption of their colonies. On this modi of ICA, these actions have been modeled between imperialist countries.

Fig. 4 illustrates the whole schematics of this movement, which is similar to the movement of colonies towards their imperialists.
But the difference of this movement is that the movement will occur only if the new position gives more power to the imperialist country. Otherwise the imperialist will maintain its previous weaker at some axis such as economic, political and social, will move towards the position of the most powerful imperialist by x imp units and take new position with condition of more power. distribution, and the distance between to imperialists is illustrated by d imp . Of course this movement of imperialists does not fully comply with the applied policies of the imperialist country and some deviation was observed in the fi nal result which is modeled by adding random angle (  X  imp ) to the movement course of imperialists. The  X  imp angle is also a random value with uniform distributed (although any other appropriate distribution can be used). So we have as follows: x imp U  X  0 ; The act  X  imp and  X  imp like the  X  and  X  .

Fig. 5 illustrates the new absorption action, in which fi imperialists move towards the most powerful imperialist to increase their power, and then colonies will pull to their imperialists.
 3.3. TLA
The TLA is a newly introduced evolutionary algorithm which is a population based technique, using a population of solutions to reach the global solution ( Rao et al., 2012 ). The principle idea of TLA is the simulation of teaching  X  learning process in a traditional classroom. In this optimization algorithm, the assumed population is a group of learners and parameters involved in objective function of the optimization problem are offered to learners as  X  fi tness  X  value of the optimization problem. The best solution (best value of objective function) in the entire population is considered as the teacher. The procedure of this method ends in two stages: (1) teacher phase, which is learning through teacher and (2) learn-ing phase, which is learning through exchange of information between learners. 3.3.1. Teacher phase
In this phase a teacher attempts to increase the mean result of algorithm improves other individuals ( X i ) by shifting their posi-tions towards the position of the teacher X teacher. The position of each individual is produced by taking into account the current mean value of the individuals ( X mean ) and represents the qualities of all learners  X  from the current generation. Eq. (30) simulates how improvement in results of students is in fl uenced by the difference between teacher  X  s knowledge and the qualities of all students:
X where T F represents a teaching factor that determines the value of the mean to be changed, and r is a random number ranging from 0to1.

The value of T F can be either 1 or 2 which is again a heuristic step and decided randomly with equal probability as T F  X  round  X  1  X  rand  X  0 ; 1  X f 2 1 g . 3.3.2. Learner phase
In this phase, increasing the knowledge of an individual ( X done by peer learning from an optional student (represented with
X ) and self-organized learning between the individual and other learners, where obviously, i is not equal to ii . According to knowl-edge levels of these two students relative to each other, two states Cost ($/h) can occur: if X ii is better than X i , X i will be moved towards X
X performs better by following Eqs. (31) or (32) , he/she will be until reaching the maximum number of generations:
X  X  X i  X  r  X  X ii X i  X  X  31  X 
X  X  X i  X  r  X  X i X ii  X  X  32  X 
Besides, infeasible individuals must be appropriately handled to determine whether one individual is better than another, when applied to constrained optimization problem. The fl ow chart for the
TLA is given in Fig. 6 ( Rao et al., 2012 ). 3.4. Hybrid MICA  X  TLA
In this section of hybrid algorithm, TLA is applied in order to increase convergence rate and improve the fi nal response of MICA.
The fl ow chart of teaching and learning phase for hybrid algorithm is shown is Fig. 7 . In each empire, imperialist plays the role of teacher and its colonies are considered as students. According to
Eq. (33) ,at fi rst, the imperialist teaches its colonies in political, economic and social and in the next step, learning is done in accordance to Eqs. (34 ) and ( 35 ) on the colonies of same imperialist in order to increase the power of colonies and improve their political, social and economic position. T f and r are perfor-mance indexes in TLA. colony new  X  colony i  X  r  X  colony ii colony i  X  X  34  X  colony new  X  colony i  X  r  X  colony i colony ii  X  X  35  X 
If a colony reaches a better position than its imperialist, the two countries will replace their positions with each other. Hence, the power of each empire will increase because of improvement of position of imperialist and colonies and this means reaching the more optimal point in less time in an optimization problem, which is the main objective pursued in optimization problem. Because of hybrid algorithm  X  s higher convergence rate to fi nal value relative to sole ICA and TLA algorithms, the initial population of MICA and
MICA  X  TLA attributed to ICA and TLA is selected a much less amount, which had no effect on fi nal result and convergence rate.
The fl ow chart of proposed hybrid algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 8 . 4. Numerical results of optimization in performance comparison
In order to verify the performance and ef fi ciency of the proposed hybrid approach based power fl ow optimization approach, hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach is tested on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus power systems. The hybrid MICA  X  TLA and other algorithms have been implemented in MATLAB 7.6 and the simulation run on a Pentium IV E5200 PC 2 GB RAM.

Penalty factors in (13) for all the test systems are chosen,  X  5,000,000,  X  V  X   X  Q  X  50,000 and  X  S  X  1000. The different algo-rithms have been applied to solve the OPF problem for different cases with different objective functions. In each case, 30 test runs were performed for solving the OPF problem using the different algorithms. The different algorithms parameters used for the simulation are summarized in Table 1 .

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach, seven different cases have been considered as follows: Case studies on the IEEE 30-bus test system: 820 830 840 850 860 870 Cost ($/h) Case studies on the IEEE 57-bus test system:
Comparisons of the proposed hybrid approach with other corresponding algorithms con fi rm the effectiveness of the pro-posed hybrid approach. 4.1. IEEE 30-bus test system
In this section, results of solving OPF problem by implementa-tion of hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach, obtained by simulation runs will be presented. In order to evaluate the performance of the hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach based on Newtonian physical law of gravity and law of motion ( Dommel and Tinney, 1968 ) which is tested on standard IEEE 30-bus test system as shown in Fig. 9 . Generator data, bus data and the minimum and maximum limits for the control variables are presented in Duman et al. (2012) , Niknam et al. (2012) and Sayah and Zehar (2008) .

The IEEE 30-bus test system has six generators at the buses 1, 2, 5, 6  X  demand is 2.834 p.u. at 100 MVA base. The maximum and minimum voltages of all load buses are considered to be 1.05  X  0.95 in p.u.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach, different cases with various objectives are considered as follows. 4.1.1. Case 1: minimization of fuel cost
The objective function of this case is minimization of fuel cost for all generators which can be formulated as follows: J  X   X  NG where F i and P Gi are the fuel cost of the i th generator and the output of the i th generator, respectively.  X  i , b i and c generator. The values of cost coef fi cients are presented in Niknam the proposed MICA  X  TLA from the best values of the 30 runs, and the minimum cost obtained from this algorithm are presented in Table 2 with approach equal to 801.0488 $/h which is less than other algorithms. The steep convergence of total fuel cost of algorithms is shown in Fig. 10 , which is clear that the proposed hybrid approach can converge to its global best in less iteration compared with other algorithms. In order to assess the potential of the proposed hybrid approach, a comparison between the results of cost obtained by the proposed approaches and those reported in the literature has been carried out with results shown in Table 3 , which can be seen that the results obtained from the hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach is better than those reported in the literature. 4.1.2. Case 2: minimization of fuel cost with considering the valve point effect
In the second case on the IEEE 30-bus test system, we will include loading effect on generating unit's performance, this is done by adding a sine component to cost curves of generators which simulates valve point loading effects on their characteris-tics. The cost coef fi cients for these units are presented in Niknam et al. (2012) .
 The objective function can be expressed as below:
J  X   X  NG unit. Fig. 11 shows the cost function of generators without and with the valve point effect of the i th generating unit.
The obtained optimal settings for adjusting control variables from the proposed method are given in Table 2 , and Table 4 presents the comparison of the proposed hybrid approach of other heuristic techniques previously mentioned in the preliminary section of paper.

According to the obtained simulation data, the minimum cost obtained from the proposed approach is 824.6023 $/h, which is less comparing to result of other algorithms. Fig. 12 shows the convergence of the algorithms for the cost function of generators Cost ($/h) with the valve point effect. As can been seen, the ability of the offered hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach to fi nd accurate OPF solutions, in this case study is reinstated by the gathered results. 4.1.3. Case 3: minimization of fuel cost with considering the prohibited zones
Fig. 13 shows the cost function with prohibited zones. The prohibited operating zones in the unit  X  s strictly limit the unit ability to regulate system load, because load regulation may result in its falling into certain prohibited operating zones. Therefore, in the practice when adjusting the operation output of a unit one must avoid the operation in the prohibited zones ( Niknam et al., 2012 ).

The additional constraints for units with prohibited operating zones are shown in (38) :
P
P
P where m i is the number of prohibited zones in unit i. l and u denote the lower bound and upper bound of the prohibited zone of the generator.

The cost coef fi cients and prohibited for these units are pre-sented in Niknam et al. (2012) and the obtained optimal settings of control variables for this case study are shown in Table 2 , con-fi rming hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach as the most appropriate solution for minimization of fuel cost in the OPF problem. The best fuel cost result calculated by hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach is compared to the results obtained by other techniques in Table 5 .
Judging from Table 5 , it can be seen that the minimum cost is 801.3302 $/h which is less in comparison to the reported results in the literature and other algorithms. Also the convergence of algorithms for the minimum fuel cost with considering the prohibited zones is shown in Fig. 14 . 4.1.4. Case 4: minimization of fuel cost with considering the prohibited zones and valve point effect
This section of study considers the prohibited zones and valve point effect simultaneously. The obtained optimal settings for adjusting control variables from the proposed method are given in Table 2 , and Table 6 presents the comparison of the proposed hybrid approach other heuristic techniques.

According to the obtained simulation data, the minimum cost obtained from the proposed hybrid approach is 824.6027 $/h which is less than the results of other algorithms. The variation of the total fuel cost is shown in Fig. 15 . As can been seen in this fi gure, the hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach converges global best in less iteration compared with other algorithms. 824 826 828 830 832 834 836 838 840 Cost ($/h) 650 655 660 665 670 Cost ($/h) 4.1.5. Case 5: piecewise quadratic fuel cost functions
From practical point of view, in a power system, many thermal generating units may be supplied with several fuel sources like oil, coal or natural gas. The fuel cost functions of these units may be dissevered as piecewise quadratic fuel cost functions for different fuel types ( Sayah and Zehar, 2008 ). Fig. 16 shows cost function units are presented in Sayah and Zehar (2008) .

Clearly, the fuel cost coef fi cients of remaining single fuel source generators have the same values as case 1 condition. The fuel cost characteristics for the generating units connected at number 1 and 2 buses are now represented by a piecewise quadratic func-tion to model different fuels given by:
F  X  P Gi  X  X  where  X  ik , b ik and c ik represent cost coef fi cients of the i th generator for fuel type k . Objective function can be described as follows:
J  X  !
Table 2 presents a summary of the optimization results for the best solution, and Table 7 presents the comparison of the proposed algorithms other heuristic techniques previously mentioned in the preliminary section of paper.

According to the obtained simulation data, it can be seen that the minimum fuel cost is 647.1002 $/h, which is less in comparison to the reported results in the literature and other algorithms. Also the convergence of hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach and other algo-rithms for the OPF problem with minimum fuel cost is shown in
Fig. 17 . As can been seen, in this case study, the ability of the offered hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach to fi nd accurate OPF solutions is reinstated by the gathered results. 4.2. IEEE 57-bus test system
In order to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach and other algorisms in larger scale power systems, a standard IEEE 57-bus test system is introduced as the more powerful test for the phase 2 of the simulations. The
IEEE 57-bus test system is includes seven generators at the buses 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 12, 80 transmission lines and 15 branches under load tap setting transformer branches. The shunt reactive power sources are considered at buses 18, 25 and 53 and the total load demand of system is 1250.8 MW and 336.4 MVAR. The bus data, the line data and the cost coef fi cients and minimum and max-imum limits of real power generations are presented in Vaisakh and Srinivas (2011) . The maximum and minimum values of voltages of all generator buses and tap setting transformer control variables are set at 1.06  X  0.94 in p.u., and the maximum and minimum values for voltages of all load buses are de fi ned as 4.17 4.18 4.19 4.2 4.21 4.22 Cost ($/h) 1.06 and 0.94 in p.u., respectively, and also the maximum and minimum values of shunt reactive power sources are 0.0 and 0.3 in p.u.. During this simulation, 30 test runs were carried out for solving OPF problem using the algorithms. 4.2.1. Case 1: minimization of fuel cost
In this simulation process of hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach and other algorithms performance evaluation, objective function is the minimization of quadratic cost function. The objective function is described as follows: J  X   X  NG output of the i th generator, respectively.  X  i , b i and c coef fi cients of the i th generator and NG is the number of total generator.

The obtained optimal setting from simulation for adjustment of control variables are shown in Table 8 . Fig. 18 illustrates conver-gence characteristic of the best fuel cost result obtained from the hybrid MICA  X  TLA and other algorithms. The obtained best (mini-mum) fuel cost from applying hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach is 41,675.0545 $/h. By examining the results in Table 8 , it turns out that the best fuel cost calculated by hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach is quite less in comparison to reported best result in the literature and other algorithms. 4.2.2. Case 2: minimization of fuel cost with voltage pro improvement
Bus voltage is considered one of the most important security and service indexes. Taking into account only a cost-based objec-tive in an OPF problem will result in a feasible solution with an undesirable voltage pro fi le. So, in this case, a twofold objective function is needed to minimize the fuel cost and improve voltage pro fi le by minimizing the load bus voltage deviations from 1.0 per unit. The objective function can be expressed as below ( Vaisakh and Srinivas, 2011 ):
J  X   X  NG where  X  is a suitable weighting factor which will be selected by the user. In this case, the weighting factor is selected as 120,000 ( Vaisakh and Srinivas, 2011 ), and the proposed hybrid approach has been applied to search for the optimal solution of the problem.
The resulted optimal setting for control variables obtained by appliance of the hybrid MICA  X  TLA and other algorithms are shown in Table 9 . Figs. 19 and 20 illustrate convergence characteristic of the best fuel cost result with voltage pro fi le improvement obtained from the proposed hybrid approach and other algo-rithms. Additionally, comparison of the resulted voltage pro of this case to the voltage pro fi le of case 1 shows a considerable decreasing from 1.6161 p.u. in cases 1 to 0.539 p.u. in case 2 which is equivalent to 66.648%.

The critical performance indexes such as the best (minimum) cost (best), the worst (maximum) cost (worst), the standard deviation (std.) and the mean cost (mean) for IEEE 30-bus test system for 30 independent runs are shown in Table 10 . According to the presented results, the hybrid MICA  X  TLA has better perfor-mance and more robustness than ICA, TLA and MICA algorithms.
The CPU time of approaches for test systems of different cases are shown in Table 11 . According to this table, the hybrid MICA TLA approach can converge to its global solution in less time than
ICA, TLA and MICA algorithms for more cases of test systems. Cost ($/h) Voltage deviations (p.u.) 5. Conclusions
In this paper, a hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach has been offered as a novel solution for solving OPF problem. At the beginning, the
OPF problem was described as a non-linear optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints in power systems. During the study, different non-smooth cost functions were considered also to minimize the fuel cost such as quadratic cost function, piecewise quadratic cost function, cost function with valve point indicated, the proposed hybrid algorithm was successfully imple-mented the goal to fi nd global or near global best settings of the control variables of an IEEE 30-bus and the IEEE 57-bus test systems with superiority relative to other approaches, as the comparison of results obtained from hybrid MICA  X  TLA approach and other mentioned methods con fi rms the superiority of the proposed hybrid approach over stochastic techniques in terms of solution quality for the OPF problem. This property ensures hybrid
MICA  X  TLA approach to be less susceptible to getting trapped on local minima. The hybrid MICA  X  TLA algorithm fi nds the minimum (optimal) value an average CPU time less compared to than ICA, TLA and MICA algorithms.
