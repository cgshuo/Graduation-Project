 Isabella Poggi  X  Federica Cavicchio  X  Emanuela Magno Caldognetto Abstract Irony has been studied by famous scholars across centuries, as well as more recently in cognitive and pragmatic research. The prosodic and visual signals of irony were also studied. Irony is a communicative act in which the Sender X  X  literal goal is to communicate a meaning x, but through this meaning the Sender has the goal to communicate another meaning, y, which is contrasting, sometimes even opposite, to meaning x. In this case we have an antiphrastic irony. So an ironic act is Sender, is not the one communicated by the literal meaning of the communicative act: it must be understood through inferences by the Addressee. The ironic state-ment may concern an event, object or person, and in this case, the Addressee, or a third person, or even the Sender itself (Self-irony). In this paper we define irony in terms of a goal and belief view of communication, and show how the annotation scheme, the Anvil-Score, and illustrate aspects of its expressive power by applying it to a particular case: ironic communication in a judicial debate.
 Keywords Irony Goals and beliefs communication Multimodal communication Annotation 1 Multimodal communication An annotation scheme is a tool to describe communication and find regularities in it. But communication is a complex thing, since it exploits multiple modalities and can communication at higher levels of complexity can be a test to check the expressive power of a descriptive tool.

In this paper we present an annotation scheme, the Anvil-Score, and illustrate aspects of its expressive power by applying it to a particular case of communication: irony.

In Sects. 2  X  4 we provide a definition and a model of irony in terms of a goal and belief model of communication; in Sect. 5 we illustrate the main features of the Anvil-Score annotation scheme, and in 6 we analyze some examples of ironic communication in a judicial debate. 2 A model of communication in terms of goals and beliefs Irony has been studied by famous scholars across centuries (Aristotle 1973 ; Fontanier 1827 X 1830 ), as well as more recently in cognitive and pragmatic research (Grice 1975 ; Booth 1974 ; Attardo 2000 ; Attardo et al. 2003 ; Sperber and Wilson 1992 ; Kerbrat-Orecchioni 1980 ; Anolli et al. 2002 ). In this paper we cannot provide an exhaustive overview of research about irony, but we only define irony in terms of a goal and belief view of communication, and show how the annotation scheme we propose can account for the multimodal devices of ironic communication.

According the model we adopt, communication is a kind of action whose goal is to influence other people through giving them beliefs (Conte and Castelfranchi 1995 ; Poggi 2007 ). An Agent S (Sender) who performs a Communicative Act has the goal G to influence another Agent A (Addressee), that is to request A to do some action, in the interest either of A or of S himself; an action of a practical kind (e.g.  X  X  X pen the window X  X ) or of a cognitive kind: to provide some information ( X  X  X id John arrive? X  X ) or to believe some information ( X  X  X ohn is here X  X ). A Communicative Act is composed by a performative and a propositional content; the performative request, to provide information for a question, to believe some information for an informative statement; and the propositional content is the specific action or performative and propositional content are complex beliefs, each composed by a set of single beliefs. To communicate each belief B of his Communicative Act, S produces a signal s that he assumes is linked, in the minds of both S and A, to belief B, with B then being the Meaning of signal s. A signal s is a perceivable stimulus that S can produce in any productive modality X  X  word, an intonative contour, a gesture, a gaze, a facial expression, a posture, a touch, but also something drawn or written on paper or a screen X  X nd that S should perceive through a corresponding sensory modality X  X uditory for words and intonation; visual for gesture, gaze, facial expression, posture, drawings; tactile for touch, and so on. The links between signals and meanings are stated by a Communicative System, that is, a set of rules about the meaning of specific signals (e.g. lexical rules) or of particular combina-tions and sequences of signals (e.g. syntactic rules).

The combination of beliefs that results by applying the lexical and syntactic rules for a verbal or sign language, and/or by processing the meanings of non-verbal signals in a communicative act, is its literal meaning, which expresses the literal goal of that communicative act. But communicative acts, as any kind of action, beside their literal goal may have a supergoal: a further goal X  X ence an indirect meaning X  X or which the understood by the Addressee through either automatic or creative inferences. For example, through the literal goal of my sentence  X  X  X re you going home? X  X  X  X he literal meaning of a question X  X  may want you to understand the supergoal X  X he indirect meaning of a request for action X  X sking you to offer me a lift. So a communicative act may have a non-literal (indirect) meaning beyond its literal meaning.

A typical case of communicative items or communicative acts that have a non-literal meaning are rhetorical figures. In the model adopted here, a rhetorical figure is a case of  X  X  X ecitation X  X  (Vincent and Castelfranchi 1981 ; Castelfranchi and Poggi 1998 ), that is, of revealed deception X  X hus, not deception in fact: the Sender communicates something different from what s/he thinks, but wants the Addressee to understand that it is not what s/he thinks. If I use a metaphorical expression like  X  X  X  sea of troubles X  X  , I know, and I want you to know, that it is not a real sea of water what I am speaking of, but just a  X  X  X ide quantity of troubles X  X . 3 Irony An ironic statement may concern an event, object or person, and in this case, the Addressee, or a third person, or even the Sender itself (Self-irony).

Irony is a communicative act in which the Sender X  X  literal goal is to communicate a meaning x, but through this meaning the Sender has the goal to communicate another meaning, y, which is contrasting, sometimes even opposite to meaning x (Poggi 2007 ): antiphrastic (from Greek ant X  ` = opposite + phrasis = saying), as it was called by classical rhetorics. So an ironic act is an  X  X  X ndirect speech act X  X  (Searle 1969 ), in that its  X  X  X rue X  X  meaning, the one really intended by the Sender, is not the one communicated by the literal meaning of the communicative act: it must be understood through inference by the Addressee.

But the condition that you say something while meaning something different or opposite does not distinguish irony from other rhetorical figures, like for instance reticence, where I do not tell you something, but I want you to understand I do know what I don X  X  tell you. So another aspect of irony is that very often the literal meaning (and consequently also the indirect meaning) of an ironic statement has an evaluative import, in that it directly bears, or makes you infer, some evaluation. When the ironic meaning is the opposite of the literal one, if the literal meaning is positive, the ironic meaning is negative (e.g. an ironic praise), and the other way around (ironic criticism).
An example of the former: suppose I spill some drops of tomato onto your new white silk luxurious shirt and you tell me:  X  X  X lever, very clever! X  X  this is seemingly a praise, actually a reproach. On the contrary, the latter case holds if, while commenting on a student X  X  very good dissertation you say:  X  X  X ou provided a shamefully accurate overview of the pertinent literature! X  X  apparently a criticism, in fact a praise.
Again, the evaluative import of irony does not distinguish this from other rhetorical figures, like euphemism, in which I use a word bearing a positive evaluation to refer to something that is generally evaluated as negative. A further distinctive condition of irony is then that the Sender has the goal to joke, to make fun of something, or to  X  X  X ease X  X , ridicule someone through his statement.
Let us see some examples of irony drawn from a judicial debate. Many of the fragments we present here are drawn from the  X  X  X ani pulite X  X  ( X  X  X lean hands X  X ) trial, a trial in which, in 1992 X 1994, a number of very influential Italian politicians were impeached for having received illicit funding for their political parties.
First see a case of irony concerning the Addressee: (1)
The prosecutor Di Pietro (DP) is trying to demonstrate that the accused, the politician Cirino Pomicino (CP), received 5 billions Italian Lire from Dr. Ferruzzi for the election campaign of his party. CP says that the day after the elections he received Ferruzzi at his home at 7.30 in the morning, and that he did so just because 7 months before he had promised Sama he would meet Ferruzzi.

DP, in order to imply that CP did know he was committing some illicit thing, ironically remarks it is quite strange that Cirino Pomicino received Dr. Ferruzzi at his home at 7.30 in the morning, and, moreover, that this was only because, 7 months before, he had been committed to meet Ferruzzi, and not because he was to thank him for granting 5 billions for the election campaign!
He says: Il vero impegno che aveva preso questo signore era di ringraziare, di sdebitarsi di un impegno che aveva preso col dottor Sama a giugno di sette mesi prima . (The true commitment of this gentleman was to thank, to pay off his debt of something he had been committed to with Dr. Sama in June of 7 months before).
This is a case of irony directed to the Addressee; DP states, as if he were convinced thereof X  X ut ironically, since he only pretends to be convinced X  X hat CP was committed to meet Ferruzzi only out of a past promise to Sama. So, it is an antiphrastic irony, since the intended meaning is that this was not CP X  X  true commitment; the true one was to thank Ferruzzi for the 5 billions granted. Finally, through ridiculing the unbelievably of CP X  X  statement, an evaluation of accused.

Here is now an example of self-irony: irony of the Sender about himself. (2) The Attorney Spazzali, while interrogating the accused Citaristi, mentions Dr.
Bernabe ` . This is a Freudian slip because, although mentioning him is not in fact pertinent now, Spazzali is actually convinced that Bernabe ` was in relation with
Citaristi. He says:
S.: Sapeva anche, ed e ` questo che le chiedo, quali fossero le posizioni di Grotti e di Bernabe ` insieme all X  X NI in relazione ...? C.: Di Grotti e di Sernia vuol dire
S .: (Schiocca pollice e medio della sinistra e sorride) C X  X  ` qualche ragione: mi scivola sempre la lingua si Bernabe ` . Di Sernia . (S.: You also knew, and this is what I ask you, what were the positions of Grotti and Bernabe ` with ENI as to ...
 C.: Of Grotti and Sernia you mean
S.: (snaps thumb and middle finger and smiles) There is some reason for this: my tongue always slips over Bernabe ` . Of Sernia .)
This is a case of self-irony, one concerning the Sender himself. Spazzali ostenta-tiously corrects himself X  X napping thumb and middle finger is a way to show one wants to retrieve the correct word: hence, a way to acknowledge one X  X  slip of the tongue, and hence again a self blame for the mistake X  X  negative evaluation of himself. But the smile shows he is making fun of himself, so this is an ironic self blame: the negative evaluation is reversed into a somehow positive one. Here is the antiphrastic aspect: he is somehow accepting his own error, thus implying it is not so odd to mention Bernabe ` . 4 Understanding irony How do we understand irony? An Addressee, in order to understand the ironic meaning of a speech act, must go through two steps: first understand that the Sender intends to be ironic (irony alert) (Attardo et al. 2003 ), and then, through inference, retrieve the ironic meaning from the literal meaning (irony comprehension). We will mainly focus on the first step, which is particularly interesting to show the potentialities of our annotation scheme. 4.1 Irony alert To trigger the inferences that are necessary to understand the ironic meaning, the Addressee must first be  X  X  X lerted X  X  to the presence of irony in the perceived communicative act.

There are four ways in which an Addressee can be alerted to the presence or irony: a. no signal b. metacommunication c. paracommunication d. parody 4.1.1 No alert signal In being ironic, you imply that you in fact do not believe what you are saying. But what causes people to believe or not to believe what one says? In cognitive terms (Castelfranchi and Poggi 1998 ) an Addressee is more likely to believe that what you say is true if it is congruent with what he already believes as true, while disbelief, doubt or suspicion is brought about when what you say is highly incompatible with his previous knowledge. So, if you want one to understand that what you are saying is something you do not think is true, what you say should be highly contrasting, or definitely incompatible, with what you think he believes true, and this may be enough to let him think you are kidding. Therefore, sometimes the presence of irony is not signalled at all, and the Addressee can by himself understand the sentence is ironic, merely thanks to its being utterly incompatible with his previous beliefs drawn from the context or from encyclopaedic knowledge (Giuliani and Orletti 1977 ). Suppose two friends are walking, completely damp, under a violent shower, and one of them says:  X  X  X eautiful weather, is it? X  X  . In this case alerting to irony is not necessary, since there is a blatant contradiction between the beliefs communicated and those contextually shared.

In other cases, though, the Sender needs to mark his own ironic intent, that is, signal irony through some marker of irony, in many different ways: 4.1.2 Metacommunication: a specific signal of irony A first way to communicatively alert the Addressee to your irony is to produce a specific irony signal. In this case, one performs a metacommunicative signal: a signal conveying a metacommunicative act, one that communicates about another communicative act, tells you how to interpret it.

The metacommunicative act communicates about the communicative act in the following way:
The metacommunicative signal may be either a  X  X  X edicated X  X  signal, one that specifically means  X  X  X  am being ironic X  X , or a  X  X  X eneric alert signal X  X , one that simply encourages you to go beyond the literal interpretation. A  X  X  X edicated X  X  metacom-municative signal of irony may be a verbal signal like  X  X  I X  X  just kidding  X  X  , o r  X  X  I X  X  ironic  X  X , or a facial signal like the ironic smile (raising the corner of only one lip), which all specifically mean  X  X  X  am being ironic X  X .

But beside these, we can also produce more generic signals: for example a verbal phrase to be added after the ironic sentence, like  X  X  X et X  X  say X  X , or  X  X  X o to speak X  X ; or else, a blank face (an inexpressive, but ostentatiously inexpressive face), a wink, a tongue in cheek (Attardo et al. 2003 ), or biting one X  X  lower lip. All of these metacommunicative signals only communicate something like:  X  X  X here is something more that I want to communicate X  X , but not specifically  X  X  X  am ironic X  X . In fact,  X  X  X et X  X  say X  X , or  X  X  X o to speak X  X  metacommunicate that the preceding sentence should not be interpreted in the literal sense: a wink bears a meaning of allusion, a blank face tells you have a humorous intent; the tongue in cheek and biting one X  X  smiling lip ostentates a fake embarrassment about what you are saying.
 4.1.3 Paracommunication of irony: contradiction between signals Another way to induce the Addressee not to believe the literal meaning of a sentence is to produce a paracommunicative act. Para ` , in Greek, means  X  X  X ear, close to X  X , as opposed to meta ` that means  X  X  X ver, about X  X : so by  X  X  X ara-communication X  X  we mean that one produces, either simultaneously or in sequence, another signal communicating a meaning which is incompatible with that of that communicative act. In this case this is a para-communicative (not meta-communicative) signal: one more signal, either in the verbal or in another modality, that provides other information, parallel to that conveyed by the former signal but different from it, in such a way that only a  X  X  X hoice X  X  between the two meanings communicated allows you to obtain a final interpretation.

Obviously, a verbal paracommunicative signal can only be in sequence with the communicative act at issue: it generally follows it or, more rarely, can precede it. A signal in another modality, instead, can follow, precede, or even be simultaneous to one in the verbal modality.

Here is a case where a verbal paracommunicative signal follows an ironic speech act: (3) I love John. My nose .

In other cases, though, the speech act itself contains a verbal signal, for example a word, that highly contrasts with others word in such a way as to make the Addressee suspicious about the very credibility of the whole speech act. Here are two passages from a sketch by Aldo, Giovanni &amp; Giacomo, an Italian comic trio. (4) Aldo: Io vorrei un po X  di peperoni!
Giacomo: Sempre in mente di quei piatti leggeri questo qui: pasta di melanzane, pane panelle patate fugghiute ... Mhm! (interiezione di disgusto) . (A: I would like to eat some peppers .

G: Always so light food in mind, this guy! Fish and chips, heggis ... Mhm! (interjection of disgust) . (Our translation, with a cultural homologous for food)).

In this example there is a contrast between Giacomo X  X  qualification  X  X  X ight X  X  of the food asked for by Aldo and the instances provided by Giacomo himself.

But see another example: (5)
Aldo, Giovanni and Giacomo are listening to Marina talking about very odd and boring intellectual concepts. While she does, Aldo e Giovanni express boredom and insufference, while Giacomo seems to be listening with attention and interest. After she goes out, Giovanni asks Giacomo: Giovanni: Perche  X  non l X  X ai interrotta, e ` h?
Giacomo: Perche  X  rimango sempre affascinato dagli abissi della psiche umana (accento enfatico su  X  X  X bissi X  X ) (Giovanni:  X  X  X hy didn X  X  you stop her? X  X 
Giacomo:  X  X  X ecause I am always fascinated by the abyss of human psyche. X  X  ) (stress over abyss ).

Here the contrast is in the aulic register of Giacomo X  X  answer X  X hat words fascinated , abyss , human psyche  X  X s opposed to the informal register of Giovanni X  X  question,  X  X  X hy didn X  X  you stop her? X  X  .

In all of these cases the paracommunicative signal is in the same modality as the other signals, and thus it can only be in sequence with them. But when the paracommunicative signal is in another modality, it can be simultaneous to the literal speech act. Here is an example. (6)
Mother is helping her son to do his home assignments:  X  X  X ow we make exercise 167. Then we X  X l make also number 168 X  X  .

The son, with face and intonation expressing boredom and resigned sadness, says:  X  X  I am looking forward to ... X  X 
The words refer to someone being willing, enthusiastic about something. But the facial behaviour is: oblique head , eyes downward leftward , far from both mother X  X  position and the copybook . The facial behaviour expresses boredom and a light repulsion: something opposite to enthusiasm. The intonation is between descending-depressed and monotone-bored.

Here irony is signalled by the contradiction between the meanings conveyed in the two modalities. In words the Speaker conveys the literal meaning; but face and voice convey the opposite.
In such a situation, the Hearer X  X  first impression is one of incongruence, that makes any interpretation impossible. So he is finally alerted to irony, he understands that irony is there. Only then can he start interpreting the sentence: he will have to compare the two opposite meanings and decide which of them, on the basis of the extra-communicative context, looks more plausible. 4.1.4 Parody A fourth way to signal that you are being ironic is when you utter a sentence that was said or could have been said by another person (partly like in the echoic model communicative multimodal behaviour (intonation, gestures, facial expression, posture and so on) and saying that sentence as in a parody. In this case the Speaker  X  X  X arodies X  X  the target, with  X  X  X arody X  X  defined as a kind of imitation aimed at ridiculing or teasing the target.

The target of parody, like for irony in general, may be the Addressee or a third person, and even, finally, in self ironic parody, the Sender himself.

But as one is imitating someone else (or himself), how can you understand that some imitation is a parody, that is, it is aimed at teasing, ridiculing the target? The parody intent is signalled by the fact that the imitation proposed, with respect to the model imitated, takes distance from it in two opposite directions: either by exaggeration (overstatement, hyperbole: see for example Kerbrat-Orecchioni 1976 ) or by minimization (understatement: see Attardo 2000 ).

Both devices are aimed at making the Addressee suspicious: they make the communicative act implausible due to its being incompatible with the perceptual or communicative context. In fact, exaggeration can be defined as communicating something with an intensity that is too higher than plausible, while minimization (understatement) is communicating something with an intensity too lower than plausible.

Let us see a case of parody through overstatement, where irony is unmasked by exaggeration. (7) In a political talk show, during the last debate between Achille Occhetto and
Silvio Berlusconi before elections in 1994, Achille Occhetto, chief of the communist party, while talking of an investigation in which some people of his party have been charged with corruption, reminds that  X  X  X l Giornale X  X , a newspaper of the opposite party, was gloating about this and announced the news triumphally.

Occhetto says: Volevano allargare la testata ....( X  X  X hey wanted to enlarge the front page X  X ), and while saying this makes the gesture of someone pulling a sheet with the two hands extended at their farthest in opposite directions.

A man X  X  hands extended up to their maximum extension depict a newspaper as large in an exaggerated way. Since it is impossible for a newspaper to be that large, the Addressee can understand this is not true; and this is the alert to a non-literal meaning of the communicative act.

In other cases, on the contrary, the contradiction that alerts to irony is achieved through understatement, i.e., by minimizing something which is clearly very important or relevant. (8)
The accuser Di Pietro, while interrogating Paolo Cirino Pomicino, is trying to ascertain how did he receive 5 billions Lire from industry for his party and its electoral campaign through Dr. Bisignani, a mediator of Dr. Ferruzzi, and it comes out that Cirino Pomicino received different amounts of money in different occasions. But since he is speaking of this money as if it were quite natural to take Pomicino should not minimize this.

So Di Pietro says:  X  X  X rriva una seconda volta Bisignani. Cosa fa? Un X  X ltra busta  X  X  . ( X  X  X isignani arrives for the second time.  X  X  X hat does he do? One more envelope. X  X ).

An envelope is at first sight a very innocent thing; and it is a minimization in that it lets you think that money (and such a lot of money!) is generally not contained in it. This is how Di Pietro is making a parody of the understatement with which Cirino Pomicino is talking of so serious things like corruption. (9)
Again, Di Pietro wants to demonstrate that Cirino Pomicino did know he was doing some illicit thing, and to argue for this he remarks that every time he received people carrying those envelopes he always did around eight in the morning: a quite strange time to receive people at home! Cirino Pomicino tries to argue that this is not that strange, since he lives near the airport.
 Pomicino: No, c X  X  ` un motivo. Io abito vicino all X  X eroporto di Ciampino....
Di Pietro: Allora, come scendono, via ... a prendere il caffe ` (sorride). (Pomicino: No, there is a reason. I live near Ciampino Airport.
 Di Pietro: So, as they get off the plane, c X  X on, have a coffe!! (smiles)).
Di Pietro refers to these important men, rich industry owners, as if they were simple and casual familiar friends that go have a coffee at Cirino Pomicino X  X  home. This is where he parodies them by minimizing their status and reducing their solemn business visit to a visit to dear friends.

In both (8) and (9), Di Pietro as in a parody imitates the naturalness and nonchalance with which Cirino Pomicino is talking of serious things, and does so by using a language that is ostentatiously informal: in the end, through understatement.
In fact, in these cases we have a double understatement. Cirino Pomicino is using understatement to minimize the seriousness of his behaviour, and Di Pietro is parodying his understatement with still more understatement: paradoxically, by exaggerating Cirino Pomicino X  X  understatement. Thus he alerts the Addressees X  X he Judge and the Court X  X o his irony. 4.2 Irony comprehension Once understood that a sentence is to be interpreted as ironical, the Addressee has to understand the real meaning intended by the Sender by inferring it through inference from the literal meaning. This is done, for antiphrastic irony, by reversing the literal meaning and finding the opposite of it. For example, in (9) the literal meaning of Di Pietro X  X  sentences is  X  X  X hese guys were simply going have a coffee X  X , which implies  X  X  X his was a very innocent behaviour X  X ; but what is inferred as ironic meaning is the opposite:  X  X  X hese guys were visiting because Cirino Pomicino had to thank them for granting 5 billions X  X ; which implies  X  X  X his was corruption X  X . 5 An annotation scheme to capture the subtleties of irony To describe multimodal communication, Poggi and Magno Caldognetto ( 1996 ) proposed the annotation scheme of the  X  X  X ultimodal Score X  X , where on five parallel lines, like in a musical score , all the signals of a multimodal message are transcribed and analyzed separately and in their mutual interaction.

Later, as the multimodal score was in the beginning a paper/pencil method it was implemented at the ISTC-CNR of Padua in ANVIL (ANnotation of VIdeo and Language) by Kipp ( 2001 ).

The implementation of the multimodal score in ANVIL filled the time gap problems of the previous implementation systems (Magno Caldognetto et al. 2004 ). ANVIL provides the capability to show all the modes concurrently in different panels in the time flux, allowing to better understand the line up between speech and other communication modalities. Moreover ANVIL was augmented by ISTC-CNR with acoustic analysis through PRAAT (Boersma 1996 ) so that, beyond the segmentation into phrases and sentences already provided by ANVIL, a level was added with the transcription of phones and syllables; the pitch and intensity contours were labelled on a qualitative basis. The gesture modality allows different lines for modalities of head, forehead, eyebrows, eyes, gaze and mouth were provided.
In the ANVIL-Score, each signal of each modality goes through different levels of analysis:  X  description : the signal is described on the basis of its perceptual characteristics,  X  meaning : a meaning is attributed to the signal at issue, and it is expressed into  X  type of meaning : the meaning is classified on the basis of a semantic taxonomy
Some modalities also include:  X  global and specific signal segmentation : the temporal structure of the signal is  X  relation with speech: by comparing the signal at issue with the co-produced
The most distinctive characteristic of this annotation system is that it aims at identifying the meaning of each signal and translating it into words or phrases. For example a raising intonation contour could stand for  X  X  X  did not finish my talk yet X  X , the index finger stretched up could mean  X  X  X ttention please X  X , and an eyebrow raising with wide open eyes is paraphrased as  X  X  X ttention, what I X  X  saying is really important X  X ; a posture shift , as  X  X  X  am changing the topic of my discourse X  X .
In some cases (for example with gestures), on the basis of previous research (Poggi 2007 ) it is possible to label the signals with the help of pop up menus. Here are the pop menus presently implemented in the ANVIL-Score (ANVIL 3.6), for each modality:  X  Type of gesture: Batonic, Pantomimic, Pictographic, Symbolic, Deictic, Other,  X  Gesture/movement type of meaning: CI (Content Information, or Information on  X  Gesture/movement relationship to speech: Repetitive, Additional, Substitutive,  X  Specific Gesture/movement Segmentation: Start, Peak, Hold, End, None;  X  Relationship between hands: Mirror, Asymmetric, Independent, Other, None;  X  Lip/mouth movement analysis: Lexical, Emotional, Prosodic, Paralinguistic,
The Multimodal Score and the ANVIL-Score have been used for the analysis of various communicative interactions: everyday conversation, mother X  X hild interac-tion, teacher X  X upil interaction, political discourse, judicial debates, TV talk-shows, speech-therapy sessions, pianists X  and orchestra conductors X  performances, dramatic and comic movies. Such A detailed analysis might allow the implementation of Embodied Agents acting in these situations, through a copy-synthesis approach (Martin 2006 ; Buisine et al. 2006 ).

Let Us now see how the ANVIL-Score allows us to capture the subtleties of ironic communication. 6 Multimodality and the irony alert The ANVIL-Score can help us disentangle the subtleties of multimodal commu-nication in the irony alert, the first step in the comprehension of irony. To show this, we will illustrate the analysis of three cases in terms of the ANVIL-Score. The paracommunicative alert, and their analysis through the ANVIL-Score was agreed upon after assessment by three independent judges.

The first case is in the example of self-irony we mentioned above (Ex. 2). (2) (S.: You also knew, and this is what I ask you, what were the positions of Grotti and Bernabe ` with ENI as to.. .
 C.: Of Grotti and Sernia you mean
S.: (snaps thumb and middle finger and smiles) There is some reason for this: my tongue always slips over Bernabe ` . Of Sernia .

The last turn of Attorney Spazzali,  X  X  mi scivola sempre la lingua si Bernabe `  X  X . (my tongue always slips over Bernabe ` ) is analyzed through the ANVIL-Score in Fig. 1 .
Spazzali says:  X  X  Mi scivola sempre la lingua su Bernabe `  X  X  (=My tongue always slips over Bernabe ` ). The waveform and the whole Speech analysis, with a slightly descending pitch pattern, conveys a declarative performative. The Intensity analysis shows a focus on the syllables sci and li of the words scivola (slips, slides) and lingua (tongue), meaning that these words are underlined.

At the same time Spazzali performs a gesture with the index stretched, as if reproaching himself. The head turns to right, to mean he is addressing the audience. The forehead has wrinkles showing worry. All of these signals show his being sorry of his error. But at the same time he smiles as if being amused.

So the smile X  X n expression of positive emotion X  X aracommunicates a meaning that contrasts with the negative meanings of error, reproach and worry.

Let us now take Ex. 1 above, where Di Pietro says:  X  X  X he true commitment of this gentleman was to thank, to pay off his debt of an engagement he had been committed to with Dr. Sama in june of 7 months before X  X . The fragment  X  X  di un impegno che aveva preso verso il dottor Sama a giugno di sette mesi prima X  X  ( X  X  X is debt of an engagement he had been committed to with Dr. Sama in june of 7 months before X  X ) is analyzed in Fig. 2 .
The first part of the sentence ( un impegno che aveva preso con il dottor Sama a giugno ) has a rising pitch contour, of a suspensive type, which means  X  X  X his is still vague, not conclusive X  X . The intensity analysis shows a focus on the syllable giu of the word giugno , which emphasizes it: a SMI.

Meanwhile, DP lifts his left hand open with united fingers, moving it over his shoulder backward: a deictic gesture that means  X  X  X  am referring to something happened long time ago, back in the past X  X , a CI, Information on the World. The meaning he is addressing different interlocutors. Eyes are blinking three times, which might mean  X  X  X  am wrapped up X  X  (=astonished, perplexed), a SMI; and gaze is directed to the interlocutor, asking attention (=I am talking to you).

After saying  X  X  X n impegno preso con il dottor Sama a giugno X  X , DP stops talking for a frame. During this silent pause, the gesture that means  X  X  X ack in the past X  X  still holds. The eyebrows raised and the forehead horizontal wrinkles, marking After the silent pause, he finishes the sentence  X  X  X i sette mesi prima X  X  (=of 7 months before) with a descending pitch contour, that means  X  X  X  am concluding now X  X .
Meanwhile, he is focusing the syllable pri of the word prima (=before); he also raises both hands up in front of his face, by depicting, with cupped hands palms to  X  X  X ebulous thing X  X , and at the same time he looks up in the sky, as if looking at the Thus, gesture and gaze paracommunicate a meaning of vagueness which contrasts conclusion, gesture and gaze  X  X  X aracommunicate X  X , that is, communicate aside of the verbal message, a contrasting meaning, hence alerting to irony.

Even in a third example (see Fig. 3 ) Di Pietro X  X  multimodal communication alerts to irony through paracommunication. Again, he is trying to convince the judge that CP received Ferruzzi not because of a previous commitment with Sama, but because he had to thank him for the 5 billions. This is why he is being ironic while interrogating CP. (10)
Oo ` h, a mme sembra, e le chiedevo a lei conferma, se lei si sia sentito in dovere di aveva preso un impegno sette mesi prima di ricevere... Ferruzzi
Well, it seems to me, and I was asking you to confirm, if you felt a duty to wake up at 7.30 because they had given you 5 billions or because you had been committed 7 months before to receive... Ferruzzi.

While he says: Ooh, a mme sembra, e le chiedevo a lei conferma (Well, it seems to me, and I was asking you to confirm ), the speech analysis reveals a focus on the two syllables (and two words): me (me) and lei (you); he makes a gesture with both hands palms up moving forward up in a curve line, like if saying  X  X  X  offer you kindly X  X . The gaze analysis shows that he fixes CP: moreover, he lifts his eyebrows up and opens eyes wide as if saying  X  X  X  am addressing you seriously X  X . This eyes and gaze pattern is considerate as threatening by Argyle and Cook ( 1976 ), since a such configuration means  X  X  X  am observing you X  X ,  X  X  X  control you X  X .
 In contradiction with this serious and threatening gaze, in the Body Position Analysis the trunk bends down, it almost bows, as if saying  X  X  X  submit to you X  X .
Gesture and trunk show exaggerate politeness, thus looking themselves ironic (as mentioned, exaggeration is a cue to irony); but moreover, the gaze seriousness utterly contrasts with the bow and the submissive gesture. And this contrast, again, alerts to irony: the whole communicative act results as ironic. 7 Conclusion We have illustrated an annotation scheme, the ANVIL-Score, by applying it to the analysis of ironic communication. Irony is a sophisticated communicative behaviour through which the Speaker tells the true by hiding it under the false, but at the same time lets you understand what is true and what is false; he does so mainly through what we called the  X  X  X rony alert X  X , where a contrast between the meanings conveyed may induce to find the true interpretation. This complex interplay of hiding and revealing can only be described through a fine grained tool that allows you not only to describe the signals, but to take into account their meanings and their reciprocal interaction, and thus to capture the contrast between signals in parallel modalities. In this work, the analysis of some examples in a judicial debate through the ANVIL-Score allowed us to single out the aspects of the Speaker X  X  multimodal behaviour that, contrasting with each other, provide a paracommunicative alert to irony. Thus a fine-grained tool can account for subtleties of multimodal communication that the native Speaker understands in an intuitive way, but can meanings can both help a deeper understanding of human sophisticated commu-nicative behaviours and lead to a better simulation of them in Embodied Agents.
