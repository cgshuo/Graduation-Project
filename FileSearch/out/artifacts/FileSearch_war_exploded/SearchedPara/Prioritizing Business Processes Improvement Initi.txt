 Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are usually responsible for the improvement of business processes [1]. The evidence shows that 60% of business process improvement initiatives, e.g., Six Sigma and Lean IT failed in reality [2]. What can CIOs do to tackle this failure? The answer relies probably on how they make strategic decisions on what and how to prioritize improvement initiatives through a transparent process. More im-these processes [3].

Therefore, a new more neutral method for prioritizing process improvement initiatives is needed. The method should 1) identify the processes to be improved; 2) indicate how to improve; and 3) avoid politics. As a result a novel is that it should be useful, efficient and reliable.

Since January Duqtor (www.duqtor.com). The purpose of the think-tank is to facilitate dialogue and collaboration between practitioners and researchers. One initiative, that is core in this paper, is to engage CIOs and experts in collaboration for designing a method in priori-tizing business processes improvement initiatives. The managers engaged in the design endeavour came from big organizations in Scandinavia, e.g., Atlas Copco, Postnord, Vattenfall, V X ster X s Stad, Bo mbardier Nordic, SSAB, Scania, Siemens Industrial Machinery, Seco Tools, Stat kraft (Norway), Sandvik, and a Swedish con-sulting company Knowit. In February 2012, the PCM, a prototype built on Excel, was introduced for demonstration and testing in companies, e.g. Seco Tools. 
In this paper, we mainly focus on the practical experience we obtained from the demonstration of the PCM at Seco Tools. Du ring the demonstration we collected data PCM in real decision making context. The experience is documented, analysed, and interpreted. The results are served as the foundation for improving the PCM to better how on business process management, as well as propose a novel method that can be used by CIOs of large corporations. research. We then give an overview of the PCM in section 3. In section 4, we describe how PCM was introduced at Seco Tools and the results from the demonstration. of PCM contributions to research and to practice. that collectively lead to an outcome that is of value to at least one customer X . Business process management (BPM) has rapidly evolved as a management philosophy and discipline with a specific focus on business processes [3]. It considers the continuous improvement and the fundamental innovation of business process to ensure that strate-presents the five stages of business process improvement, i.e. organising for improve-ment, understanding the process, streamlining, measurements and control, and con-for examples, effectiveness, efficiency and adaptability [13]; strategic importance, process scope, needs to improve, and difficulty of improvement [14]; competition out-performing, many conflicts/high frequency/excessive non-structured communication, and continuous incremental improvement [15]; and importance, dysfunction, and fea-sibility [11]. The literature also presents the dimensions in order to clearly understand time and cost [13]; and time, cost, quality, and flexibility [11]. 
A number of BPM maturity models (e.g. [16, 17]) are developed and introduced to organizations for process improvement and innovation in order to achieve a success-indicator for improvement. However, the models lack applicability to practitioners [18]. Previous research has introduced a very few methods specifically for prioritizing processes improvement initiatives, for example, the business value scoring method and strategy alignment [12]. However, these methods only describe the process per-formance, and indicate where to prioritize, the information on how to improve is  X  X emains as a  X  X ystery phase X  in most available guidelines X  ([4], p. 178). 
Although there is no standardized methodology yet for selecting and prioritizing processes for improvement, the literature recommends that the selection criteria should focus on: i) the strategic importance of the process; ii) the performance of the process; 3) flexibility for the process improvement, e.g. resource allocation, people X  X  readiness for change, and organization supportive culture. Previous research shares certain agreements with regards to analysing and understanding process. Quantitative and formal methods are recommended. However, these methods focus on process [5]. Moreover, the results bring little values for understanding BPM as an enterprise-processes which serves as the foundation for process selection and prioritization [11]. BPM is fundamentally a CIO and senior management responsibility [1]. Process gov-ernance is crucial for the success of business process as well for sustaining and opti-mizing process improvement performance [3]. Hence, a new method is required for supporting managers X  decision making in prioritizing process improvement initiatives. The PCM consists of two models, the process assessment heat map (PAHM) and the process categorization map (CM). The CIOs and practitioners have formulated the perspectives of the heat map and the dimensions of categorization map in the design and adapt the processes for prioritizing improvement initiatives [20]. 3.1 Process Assessment Heat Map  X  PAHM The heat map helps to analyse processes from five distinct perspectives (see Table 1). the business strategy, objectives and values. Strategic positioning is the approach that Porter [21] has recommended for analysing process activities in business. With a is aligned with business strategy, objectives and values [5], [14]. We argue that posi-tioning processes with the help of PAHM support companies to open employees X  mon understanding of business processes and possible improvements.

The Implementing perspective is focussed on analysing the performance of the process that is subject to analysis. The Proving perspective is focussed on the degree to which processes are appropriately monitored and measured. Therefore it is necessary to define the proper metrics and to define the right KPIs levels. 
Table 1 shows the working definitions of the five perspectives, and the sample questions, which were adapted from [3], [22]. Because each organization has its own strategy and business processes, the model allows managers to define and refine cru-motivate and engage managers and stakeholders to provide tactical knowledge and sample experiences. Therefore, the questions should be directly related to their work life, experience and context. Second, the information included in the heat map should be focused on each relevant process and on each relevant perspective, so that prioriti-out the heat map is collected based on interviews with managers and stakeholders.

The quota-4.2 The PCM Demonstration Procedure The demonstration was completed by following the four steps. 1. The CIO firstly selected 40 processes that were intended for improvement. He then contacted the former CEO, who has worked for 30 years for the company; then he selected the VP in the Asian region, and the global process manager. They to-gether identified 12 out of 40 processes for assessment, including a few simple lower-level processes. The pre-selection was guided by using the PCM. 2. The CIO and the three managers reviewed and agreed on the core questions in the assessment. Then the three managers further recommended other stakeholders based on their informal network to perform the assessments and interviews. 
Altogether they selected 20 key stakeholders (both owner and customers of the processes) from different business functions, different countries and from different managers were the CIO/Senior Vice President, Global Distribution Manager, Country Managing Director, Global Process Manager, Director Operations and 
Human Resources, Quality Manager, Process Owners and Process Improvers. 3. Interviews with each manager were conducted by involved researchers. In the first part of the interviews the heat map (PAHM) was used. This took about one and half hours. In the second part of the interview the CM assessment was central. This part took about 30 minutes. The researchers didn X  X  impose personal opinions and kept neutral in the interviews. First the 12 selected processes for the assessment were introduced. Next the five perspectives in combination with the key questions for generating a PAHM were discussed. The managers were asked to decide on a colour, green, amber or red, based on their knowledge and experiences of the process and on discussion of the key questions with involved researchers. The managers were asked to give con-crete reasons and to motivate why they chose a specific colour. They were also asked to give their advice on how to improve the process. All these comments were documented in the heat map. Next, the interviews were focused on process categorization. The CM, the three dimensions and the key questions, and the as-is and to-be analysis were introduced by the researchers. The managers did the as-is analysis of the process by answering and reflecting on the three dimensions and the questions for the current situations first. As a follow up, they went through the same questions again but with a future oriented thinking, i.e. two to three years, of where they would like to see the proc-the heat map helped the managers to get familiar with the assessment.

Figure four shows the heat map of the process. Each cell presents the results from an assessment by an individual manager (R1 -interviewee 1 -to R20-interviewee 20). The results show that the process has high potential for future improvement in the overall assessment. A majority of the managers (17) assessed the process as hav-three managers consider it to be an amber process. The results from the five perspec-tives indicated that the improvement should be focused on Implementation (14 red, 4 amber) and Proving (10 in red, and 7 in amber). The company should also pay atten-improvement (4 in red and in amber). It seemed that most of the managers (12, 60%) were satisfied with the process performance from the perspectives of Positioning and Relating.

Although the other seven manag-ers had different perceptions of the to-be state of the process, they also believed that the process should possess the characteristics of being near the vertical line between the front and back dimension. The relative distance between the as-is dots and the to-be dots was clearly shown in the map, which indicated that the process should dimension. This suggested the need for change in the process management and resource allocation for establishing and ensuring this inter-organizational process collaboration. Figure five also showe d Tools.

Th e team reflected the shared view of the purposes and challenges for implementing the process driven operations in the organization. The two most important problems were raised at the end of the discus-process performance measurement was missing in almost all the processes, therefore the proving perspective of PAHM should be improved. Because the consensus is achieved in the PCM demonstration based on the assessments from managers at dif-ferent levels, the team was comfortable to make the decisions [21]. Accordingly, they made the following decisions: 1) five processes were prioritized for improvement, including create forecast process; 2) at leas t two KPIs per process should be published on a regular basis in order to improve process transparency and performance, in order to enhance the  X  X roving X  perspective; and 3) the organizational capabilities, e.g., peo-supporting a successful implementation of the prioritized processes. Five lessons from this demonstration stand out. 
First, the PCM is a useful, efficient and reliable method in supporting prioritization common understanding of the processes X  performance, and to reach consensus about the problems in prioritizing process improvement initiatives. The CIO/VP stated:  X  The method is a tremendous help to me, in that it creates, together with the man-agement board, a common picture regarding our as-is state and to-be state. It was a foundation, where we could agree which process works well and which does worse. This consensus was not present at all before we did this demonstration. We know where to assign our resources to the prioritized process. The processes that work fine processes the improvements should take place, but then, the how, is the next question the method can indicate. Should we go for a large change project or implementing an existing process with everyday busine ss operation through small adjustment? X 
Based on analysis of the process characteristics, the categorization map (CM) can give an indication for the  X  X ow X  question. For instance, if the to be state of a process should be formal and common, then the company can automate the process; if the to be state of a process should be informal and differentiating, then the company should implies that companies should allocate limited resources, and capabilities for ensuring a successful implementation of th e prioritized processes [3]. Second, top management should initiate and participate in the assessment. The CIO/VP recognized the power of  X  X ollectiv e intelligence X  in the demonstration proc-the company, and then those key stakeholders recommended other influential persons Therefore, politics in decision making is avoided. Involving right people also in-creases the data quality of the assessment. Consequently, it improves the quality and reflected that: viewees.

X  
Third, the interviews guided by the PCM, were conducted with the right people, which creates openness, transparency and trust in the decision-making process. The interviewees X  names were known by the whole organization. The selection of the right people was a deliberate choice. People who were not involved would  X  X uy in X  to the worried, how the people who were not intervie wed would interpret this. It turned out, because of our openness regarding who was interviewed and that we had made a consensus decision, it was quite well accepted. X  
Fourth and lastly, the interviewer(s)/facilitators should preferably remain neutral in the assessment. This helped in avoiding personal influences and creating trust during ferred more intangible knowledge during the interviews. Involving two interviewers views, since taking both notes and facilitating the interviews was too challenging. 
The general learning outcomes of this demonstration are that, 1) the PCM can iden-tify the processes to be improved and indicate how to improve. The PCM produces a mensions of CM. The PCM can solve the prioritization problem in organizations, and have deepened their understanding of ho w process prioritization and categorization CIO/VP at Seco Tools recommended that it is crucial to choose the right people in the interviews for ensuring the full benefits of using the PCM, especially, avoiding poli-tics in decision making. In other words, people in both the formal network and infor-mal network in the organization should be identified and included in the assessments [28]. Moreover, the top-down social proce ss created in adapting the PCM in decision making, has improved the communication between business and IT, enhanced the information/knowledge sharing among managers at different levels, and established a supportive culture for an effective process management. This paper presents the PCM and depicts the experience from Seco Tools in prioritiz-ing process improvement initiatives by demonstrating the method. The evidences support that the PCM is a novel method in prioritizing process improvement holistic analysis of processes from the five perspectives of PAHM and three dimen-sions of CM. The PCM can identify processes to be improved and indicate how to improve. common understanding of processes, improvement potentials and how to improve processes. This builds up a solid foundation for decision making in prioritizing proc-ess improvement initiatives. Furthermore, the company creates a novel way of making trustworthy. This supported top management in making the right decisions, and cre-ated a good  X  X uy in X  of the decisions made . Additionally, the top-down social process PCM can avoid politics in decision making for prioritizing process initiatives. 
Building upon the experience from the Seco Tools project, we further developed a web-based application of the PCM. The PCM has now been tested and evaluated by a number of Swedish companies and public organizations. We will evaluate the PCM in different contexts and improve the method in future research.
