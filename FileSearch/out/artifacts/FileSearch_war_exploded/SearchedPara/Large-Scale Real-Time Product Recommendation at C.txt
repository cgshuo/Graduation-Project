 Performance retargeting consists of displaying online ad-vertisements that are personalized according to each user X  X  browsing history. We show close to three billion personalized ads a day, each of them optimized to generate the best post-click sales performance for our clients. Within this time frame, Criteo X  X  recommender system must choose a dozen relevant products from billions of candidates in a few mil-liseconds. Our main challenge is to balance the amount of data we use with the processing speed and low-latency re-quirements of a web-scale environment.

Criteo has about ten thousand clients, each with a catalog of products that usually run in millions, sometimes more. Product-to-product similarities are computed by analyzing billions of product events (view, sales) spread over several weeks. The backend part must therefore crunch dozens of terabytes of data in a few hours.

On the other hand, retargeting is a business that requires very up-to-date recommendations. We show targetted ads that depend both on long-term user behavior as well as events that occurred a few seconds ago. Building an ar-chitecture that can accomodate such a large amount of data and yet provide accurate recommendations using almost re-altime data is a major challenge.

Metrics are also a difficult topic. Finding the metrics that will accurately predict offline the performance a model would have online is a hard problem. Constant improve-ments of our systems require a lot of trial-and-error. In our environment, online A/B testing can be a costly solution. Can we do better ?
In this talk, we will expose the way we have built our sys-tem to provide optimal recommendations under these con-straints, as well as the many challenges we have in front of us.
 Real-time, Large-Scale, Low-latency Romain Lerallut is a Senior Engineering Manager at Criteo in the Engine department, in charge of applying large-scale machine learning algorithms to actual problems such as prod-uct recommendation or graphical layout optimization. Ro-main has been working on building up the Engine since 2011, first as devlead and then as manager. Before joining Criteo, he was teaching computers how to read cursive hand-writing at A2iA. He has an engineering degree from  X  X cole des Ponts-Paristech X  and a PhD in Computer Science from  X  X coles des Mines-Paristech X .
 Diane Gasselin is a Software Engineer at Criteo, since 2011. She worked at first on the infrastructure and algorithms for predicting a banner profitability and is now part of the rec-ommendation team, responsible of selecting the best prod-ucts to display on the banner considering the context and user features. She graduated from the computer science and applied mathematics engineering school ENSIMAG.
 Nicolas Le Roux is the head of the Criteo Research Team in Paris, working on improving the Machine Learning systems at the heart of the Criteo Engine since 2012. Before joining Criteo, Nicolas was a researcher with expertise in machine learning, computer vision, neural networks, deep learning, optimization, large-scale learning and statistical modeling in general. He held a position at INRIA/ENS and before that in Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK. He has a PhD from the University of Montreal under Yoshua Bengio, working on theoretical and practical advances on neural networks and kernel methods.
