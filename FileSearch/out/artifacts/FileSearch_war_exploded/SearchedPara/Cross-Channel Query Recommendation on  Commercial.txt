 Mobile search is an emerging and promising application in China currently considering the potential huge user population, over 600-million Chinese are consuming mobile communication service. Being a start-up company, we are growing up quickly in the Chinese market by providing easy-to-use mobile search service. A large amount of first-hand usage data allow us to understand Chinese search behavior, then know how to do better, and finally evaluate how well we are doing with the feedback collected. 
In this paper, we refer to the traditional search over computer as PC search , and the search over a hand-held device as mobile search . We discuss in the following paragraphs why the two kinds of search have to be treated in different way. Although the fundamental search algorithms and architecture are similar for both PC and mobile search on the backend, more challenge actually is imposed on the latter one, and they can be summarized briefly as below: 1. Slow wireless access and processing speed: Neither GSM, GPRS nor EDGE 2. Expensive connection fee: Compared with wired connection, the charge of 3. Small screen: Quite limited information can be accessed by users without 4. Difficult input: Typing on a standard 12-key cell phone is not convenient. 5. Mobile search is brand new for many: One telephone survey made by us on a 6. Much lower average education level for mobile search users: The survey 7. One important way of amusement: Mobile phone is becoming one of the 
Figure 1(1) is the home page of Roboo mobile search engine (http:// wap. roboo. com). Several vertical channels are provided in addition to the page search, e.g., image, ring, MP3, short message, game, software etc. Here, we refer to those non-page channels as vertical channels considering they are designed for a specific kind of resource. It is built on the following points: 1. Page search is not enough for mobile search. Given current keyword-based 2. Different from PC search, looking for fun is one important initiative for those 3. Slow access speed and small screen are critical factors for the necessity of these 4. Multimedia resources, like image, video and music, are welcome by current 
We have covered so far the necessary background about mobile search as well as the search service provided by us. Although query recommendation are discussed by many research work [3,4,5], and can be found on most popular commercial search engines, like Google and Baidu (http://www.baidu.com), no effort, to our best knowledge, ever be spent on cross-channel recommendation and, more importantly, its importance on mobile search. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss the necessity of providing cross-channel recommendation, how to do that and expected outcome in Section 2. Then, in Section 3, we demonstrate the effect of our job based on log data. Section 4 gives some concluding remarks. 2.1 Why We Need It Although the design of vertical channels allows for easier search and provides convenience for mobile searchers, it brings some problems as well: 1. Users search for some target within a wrong channel. For example, we find 2. There are several related dimensions of information about one specific object. 
To solve these two problems, we propose cross-channel recommendation which may help us to achieve the following benefits: 1. Giving timely appropriate tips to searchers while they are searching in a wrong 2. Allowing more channels to be introduced to the users, providing them greater 3. The combination of the above two aspects will greatly increase the user 2.2 Algorithms for the Cross-Channel Recommendation How to realize the cross-channel recommendation in a quick and effective manner following steps: 1. Indexing queries as they appear in each channel X  X  search log separately, by 2. Given &lt; Q , Ch &gt;, i.e. query Q submitted in a specific channel Ch , do a search 4. Filter out recommended candidates with frequency lower than threshold value 5. Randomly select a recommended query as rec Q if there is at least one match by 6. If rec Qnull  X  , retrieve rec Q  X  X  corresponding channel label, rec Ch , to compose 
From this brief description, it can be seen that two kinds of information are necessary for the cross-channel query recommendation: 1. Search log data. It records queries and their corresponding frequency; 2. The similarity between the active query (i.e. the one being studied) with any 2.3 More Features about the Proposed Solution Besides the primary procedure covered above, some not-so-obvious features have to be introduced as well since they are there to ensure the success of this solution: 1. Queries with no results are filtered out firstly in each channel X  X  query log, 2. Exact match is considered with highest priority. This maximizes the 3. Ties due to multiple exact matches are solved by choosing the more frequent 4. Randomly selecting one channel when exact match is not found, but there are 
However, due to the different releasing date for different channel, the volume of random selection is applied: channels with longer operating history are more likely to be recommended. Since it was released online, the cross-channel recommendation has been operating for about five months. Our evaluation covers the following three aspects: Expected effect recommendation should appear only when th ere is indeed related resource about the and Section 2.3, we know that, given a query in a channel, recommendation is presented only when exactly or similarly matched query is found in a different channel. By filtering out queries with no results or with too low frequency, the recommendation is exp ected to be reasonable and useful. Off-line evaluation When the recommendation is made and presented to the users, we validate if the suggested query rec Q and the new channel, rec Ch , are appropriate. To do this evaluation, we randomly choose 200 queries with exact matched results, and 200 with similar matches from the query log. Three professionals are employed to vote on the suggestions: &lt; rec Q , rec Ch &gt;. If they think the recommendation is appropriate, there are at least two  X  X gree X ,  X  X isagree X  or  X  X o idea X  with the recommendation, the result is obvious; if there is one  X  X gree X , one  X  X isagree X  and one  X  X o idea X , the result is viewed as  X  X o idea X  as well. 
From Table 1, we see that 187 out of 200 (about 93.50%) recommendations are thought as appropriate when  X  X xact match X  is satisfied. The same index decreases to 69.50% (139 out of 200) for  X  X imilar match X . This exactly reflects that (a) our method is useful to recommend more dimensions of information to the searchers, and (b) the similarity measure (VSM) used here that requires future work. On-line evaluation performance. We initially considered the following measures for on-line evaluation: 1. The frequency of cross-channel recommendation is clicked by the searchers 2. The frequency of clicking happened within the results retrieved by the cross-
However, we afterwards realized that they are not as suitable as expected. Firstly, or not, there are at least three factors ignored here: (1) The searchers don X  X  notice the recommendations appearing below the retrieved results; (2) Even it is seen, the users may not click it since the results retrieved may be satisfying to them; (3) The contribution may not be measured completely if it is clicked or not since the presence of the recommendation itself may impress the searchers and keep them on our search engine. So, we can X  X  just conclude that the recommendations are not welcome if they results retrieved are clicked or not to evaluate the recommendation. 
Even so, some remarks are still shared based on our study of query log: 1. The recommendation works when there is no result found in some channel 2. The recommendation also works even when there are results retrieved given a 3. The absolute amount of times of clicking on the cross-channel 4. With most recent observations, it is estimated that about 8.0% of our monthly In this paper, we start with mobile search as the big background, along with some discussions of its special characteristics ba sed on our experience. Then, the discussion is narrowed down to our own mobile search engine, a popular one in China currently. Although our product strategy is proved to be suitable for Chinese mobile searchers, it also causes some minor problem. To fix this problem, a simple cross-channel query recommendation solution is proposed on the basis of (1) our understanding of user strategy. The overall procedure is clearly described, and our evaluation covers (1) together to present readers a comprehens ive picture about how it works and how well it performs. 
Some future work is deemed. We may do more research to find a finer model to measure the similarity between queries. Besides, more log data is required for more comprehensive on-line performance evaluation.
