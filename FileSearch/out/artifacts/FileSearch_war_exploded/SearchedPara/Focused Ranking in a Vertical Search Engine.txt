 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Design topic, focused, ranking, crawling, search Since the debut of PageRank and HITS, hyperlink-induced Web document ranking has come a long way. The Web has become increasingly vast and topically diverse. Such vast-ness has led many into the area of topic-sensitive ranking [1] and its variants. We address the high dimensionality of the Web by providing tools for focused search .Afocusedsearch engine is one which seeks coverage over a subset of topics of the Web and presents users with relevant search results in a known domain. This demonstration will introduce readers to the GenieKnows.com Vertical Search Engine.

We present the major components of our vertical search engine including: (1) a patent-pending focused Web crawler and (2) a novel hyperlink-induced focused ranking algorithm.
Focused Crawling: The crawler fetches a Web page only if its na  X   X ve Bayesian classifier determines that the page may belong to the category of interest with a high probability. The result is a collection of documents which have a high probability of being relevant within a particular vertical, while reducing bandwidth and storage requirements.

Focused Ranking: Augmenting focused crawling, doc-uments in a category C i are classified into subtopics,  X  i .We obtain these subtopics from the second-and third-level cat-egories of the DMOZ sub-directory for C i . A topic-inclusion probability is computed for each document-topic pair. The probability of d being on topic t  X   X  i is denoted P ( t | d ).
A FocusedRank index is generated by first computing an adjacency matrix, M , from the link graph of C i where a link is interpreted to exist only if a page u hyperlinks to a page v and the two contain at least one common topic. The topic-inclusion score, T ( u, v ), stored in M is the normalized sum of products of the probabilities of shared topics between u and v . That is, after normalizing the probabilities for u ,
