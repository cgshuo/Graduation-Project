This work led naturally to consider issues re-lated to the representation of those combined information types, aiming at a formal representa-tion of the used terms and other natural language expressions in order to improve interoperability of this type of language data in the context of multilingual KDIE systems. As basis for our work, we have been looking at approaches by Reymonet et al. (2009), McCrae et al. (2012) and Declerck &amp; Lendvai (2010). As a field study for our on-going work, we dealt with a large multi-
In this short paper, we present briefly the the-saurus, discuss our proposal for the modification of its organization and outline future work. The thesaurus for the social sciences is a knowl-edge source under continuous development (we are currently using version 0.92). The list of key-words used in TheSoz contains about 12,000 en-tries, of which more than 8,000 are descriptors (accepted keywords, which act as domain terms).
