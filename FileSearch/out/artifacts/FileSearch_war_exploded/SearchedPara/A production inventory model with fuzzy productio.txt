 1. Introduction
Several researchers of inventory control problem developed to estimate these parameters as random numbers because is better to estimate parameters like production and demand a considerable number of research papers have already been published incorporating imprecise inventory parameters ( Wee considered fuzzy production rate in any production inventory system. Keeping in mind the above-mentioned factor, here tity (EPQ) model incorporating fuzzy production rate. well as EPQ model. Due to this reason, various formations of consumption tendency have been studied by inventory control price dependent demand ( Ouyang et al., 2009 ), advertisement dependent demand. All of them developed their models in crisp for newly launched products for a certain time period at the manufacturer withdraws the additional discount and thus unit that some customers have already accustomed with the product products though price discount is withdrawn. This process of EPQ model.

There are some research works on inventory control problems,
Maiti (2006) developed an inventory model, where interval valued objective function was transformed to an equivalent multi-objective problem following an interval comparison app-proposed by Ishibuchi and Tanaka (1990 ) and solved using a an inventory model with interval valued inventory costs. They somes, where center and width of intervals were used for where fuzzy parameters were replaced by equivalent interval
According to them FPO on intervals is the best approach for with all the approaches-RCGA, MOGA and ICGA and results are intervals. 2. Preliminaries

According to this set of assumptions they ordered any pair of sets S 1 and S 2 as follows: 1.  X  A , B  X  A S 1 if w  X  A  X  Z w  X  B  X  . 2.  X  A , B  X  A S 2 if w  X  A  X  o w  X  B  X  .

To control memory size is imposed ( Maxsize ). Chromosomes with age exceeding every iteration. Present ICGA terminates when difference between maximum fitness ( Maxfit ) of chromosome and average almost equal. If the algorithm does not terminates (converge) under above condition then to exit from infinite loop the gradually decreases with the increase of iteration. Actually the function.
