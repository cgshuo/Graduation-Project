 In a much-quoted essay from 1946 entitled Politics and the English Language , the writer and thinker George Orwell outlines his prescription for halting a perceived decline in the English language. He argues that language and thought form a tight feedback cycle that can be either virtuous or v i-cious. Lazy language can thus promote lazy think-ing, and vice versa. Orwell pours scorn on two particular forms of lazy language: the expedient use of overly familiar metaphors merely because they come quickly to mind, even though they have lost their power to evoke vivid images,; and the use of readymade turns of phrase as substitutes for in -dividually crafted expressions. While a good writer bends words to his meaning, Orwell worries that a lazy writer bends his meaning to convenient words. phrases which, when over-used,  X  X re tacked to-gether like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.

X  Given his derogatory mechanistic view of the use of readymade phrases, Orwell would not be surprised to learn that computers are highly pr o-ficient in the large-scale use of familiar phrases, whether acquired from large text corpora or from the Google ngrams (see Brants and Franz, 2006). holes in Orwell X  X  logic. If one should  X  X ever use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print X , how then are fa-miliar metaphors ever to become dead metaphors and thereby enrich the language with new terms and new senses? And if one cannot use familiar readymade phrases, how can one make playful  X  and creative  X  allusions to the writings of others, or mischievously subvert the conventional wisdom of platitudes and clich X s? Orwell X  X  use of the term readymade is entirely negative, yet the term is a l-together more respectable in the world of modern art, thanks to its use by artists such as Marcel Duchamp. For many artists, a readymade object is not a substitute, but a starting point, for creativity. readymade emerges from an artist X  X  encounter with an object whose aesthetic merits are overlooked in its banal, everyday contexts of use; when this ob -ject is moved to an explicitly artistic context, such as an art gallery, viewers are better able to appreci -ate these merits. The artist X  X  insight is to recognize the transformational power of this non-obvious context switch. Perhaps the most famous (and no-torious) readymade in the world of art is Marcel Duchamp X  X  Fountain , a humble urinal that be-comes an elegantly curved piece of sculpture when viewed with the right mindset. Duchamp referred to his objets trouv X s as  X  X ssisted readymades X  be-cause they allow an artist to remake the act of creation as one of pure insight and inspired reco g-nition rather than one of manual craftsmanship (see Taylor, 2009). In computational terms, the Duchampian notion of a readymade allows crea-tivity to be modeled not as a construction problem but as a decision problem. A computational Duchamp need not explore an abstract conceptual space of potential ideas, as in Boden (1994). How -ever, a Duchampian agent must instead be exposed to the multitude of potentially inspiring real-world stimuli that a human artist encounters everyday. creativity that is poorly served by exploratory models of creativity, such as that of Boden (1994), and better served by the investment models such as the buy-low-sell-high theory of Sternberg and L u-bart (1995). In this view, creators and artists find unexpected or untapped value in unfashionable objects or ideas that already exist, and quickly move their gaze elsewhere once the public at large come to recognize this value. Duchampian creators invest in everyday objects, just as Duchamp found artistic merit in urinals, bottles and combs. From a linguistic perspective, these everyday objects are commonplace words and phrases which, when wrenched from their conventional contexts of use, are free to take on enhanced meanings and provide additional returns to the investor. The realm in which a maker of linguistic readymades operates is not the real world, and not an abstract conceptual space, but the realm of texts: large corpora become rich hunting grounds for investors in linguistic ob -jets trou v X s .
 tional form in the following sections. We show how a rich vocabulary of cultural stereotypes can be acquired from the Web, and how this vocab u-lary facilitates the implementation of a decision procedure for recognizing potential readymades in large corpora  X  in this case, the Google database of Web ngrams (Brants and Franz, 2006). This deci -sion procedure provides a robust basis for a simile-generation system called The Jigsaw Bard . The cognitive / linguistic intuitions that underpin the Bard  X  X  concept of textual readymades are put to the empirical test in section 5. While readymades remain a contentious notion in the public X  X  appre-ciation of artistic creativity  X  despite Duchamp X  X  Fountain being considered one of the most infl u-ential artworks of the 20 th century  X  we shall show that the notion of a linguistic readymade has si g-nificant practical merit in the realms of text ge n-eration and computational creativity. Readymades are the result of artistic appropria-tion , in which an object with cultural resonance  X  an image, a phrase, a quote, a name, a thing  X  is re-used in a new context with a new meaning. As a fertile source of cultural reference points, language is an equally fertile medium for appropriation. Thus, in the constant swirl of language and culture, movie quotes suggest song lyrics, which in turn suggest movie titles, which suggest book titles, or restaurant names, or the names of racehorses, and so on, and on. The 1996 movie The Usual Suspects takes its name from a memorable scene in 1942 X  X  Casablanca , as does the Woody Allen play and movie Play it Again Sam . The 2010 art documen -tary Exit Through the Gift Shop , by graffiti artist Banksy, takes its name from a banal sign some-times seen in museums and galleries: the sign, suggestive as it is of creeping commercialism, makes the perfect readymade for a film that la-ments the mediocrity of commercialized art.
 duce novel mashups; consider, for instance, the use of tweets from rapper Kanye West as alternate captions for cartoon images from the New Yorker magazine (see hashtag #KanyeNew-YorkerTweets ). Hashtags can themselves be linguistic readymades. When free-speech advocates use the hashtag #IAMSpartacus to show solidarity with users whose tweets have incurred the wrath of the law, they are appropriating an emotional line from the 1960 film Spartacus . Linguistic readymades, then, are well-formed text fragments that are often highly quotable because they carry some figurative content which can be reused in different contexts.  X  I am Spartacus  X  requires a great deal of cultural knowledge to appreciate. Since literal semantics only provides a small part of their meaning, a computer X  X  ability to recognize linguistic read y-mades is only as good as the cultural knowledge at its disposal. We thus explore here a more modest form of readymade  X  phrases that can be used as evocative image builders in similes  X  as in: Each phrase can be found in the Google 1T data-base of Web ngrams  X  snippets of Web text (of one to five words) that occur on the web with a fre-quency of 40 or higher (Brants and Franz, 2006). Each is likely a literal description of a real object or event  X  even  X  X obot fish X , which describes an autonomous marine vehicle whose movements mimic real fish. But each exhibits figurative po -tential as well, providing a memorable description of physical or emotional coldness. Whether or not each was ever used in a figurative sense before is not the point: once this potential is recognized, each phrase becomes a reusable linguistic read y-made for the construction of a vivid figurative comparison, as in  X  as cold as a robot fish  X . We now consider the building blocks from which these compari sons can be ready-made.. How does a computer acquire the knowledge that fish, snow, January, bullets and corpses are cultural signifiers of coldness? Much the same way that humans acquire this knowledge: by attending to the way these signifiers are used by others, esp e-cially when they are used in cultural clich X s like proverbial similes (e.g.,  X  X s cold as a fish X ).
In fact, folk similes are an important vector in the transmission of cultural knowledge: they point to, and exploit, the shared cultural touchstones that speakers and listeners alike can use to construct and intuit meanings. Taylor (1954) catalogued thousands of proverbial comparisons and similes from California, identifying just as many building blocks in the construction of new phrases and figu -rative meanings. Only the most common similes can be found in dictionaries, as shown by Norrick (1986), while Moon (2008) demonstrates that large-scale corpus analysis is needed to identify folk similes with a breadth approaching that of Taylor X  X  study. However, Veale and Hao (2007) show that the World-Wide Web is the ultimate re-source for harvesting similes.

Veale and Hao use the Google API to find many instances of the pattern  X  as ADJ as a|an *  X  on the web, where ADJ is an adjectival property and * is the Google wildcard. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is used to provide a set of over 2,000 different values for ADJ, and the text snippets returned by Google are parsed to extract the basic simile bindings. Once the bindings are annotated to remove noise, as well as frequent uses of irony, this Web harvest produces over 12,000 cultural bindings between a noun (such as fish , or robot ) and its most stereo-typical properties (such as cold, wet, stiff, logical, heartless , etc.). Stereotypical properties are ac-quired for approx. 4,000 common English nouns. This is a set of building blocks on a larger scale than even that of Taylor, allowing us to build on Veale and Hao (2007) to identify readymades in their hundreds of thousands in the Google ngrams.
However, to identify readymades as resonant variations on cultural stereotypes, we need a cer-tain fluidity in our treatment of adjectival proper-ties. The phrase  X  wet haddock  X  is a readymade for coldness because  X  X et X  accentuates the  X  X old X  that we associate with  X  X addock X  (via the web simile  X  as cold as a haddock  X ). In the words of Hofstad-ter (1995), we need to build a SlipNet of properties whose structure captures the propensity of proper-ties to mutually and coherently reinforce each other, so that phrases which subtly accentuate an unstated property can be recognized. In the vein of Veale and Hao (2007), we use the Google API to harvest the elements of this SlipNet.
We hypothesize that the construction  X  as ADJ 1 and ADJ 2 as  X  shows ADJ 1 and ADJ 2 to be mutu-ally reinforcing properties, since they can be seen to work together as a single complex property in a single comparison. Thus, using the full comple-ment of adjectival properties used by Veale and Hao (2007), we harvest all instances of the patterns  X  as ADJ and * as  X  and  X  as * and ADJ as  X  from Google, noting the combinations that are found and their frequencies. These frequencies provide link weights for the Hofstadter-style SlipNet that is then constructed. In all, over 180,000 links are harvested, connecting over 2,500 adjectival pro p-erties to one other. We put the intuitions behind this SlipNet to the empirical test in section five. In the course of an average day, a creative writer is exposed to a constant barrage of linguistic stimuli, any small portion of which can strike a chord as a potential readymade. In this casual inspiration phase, the observant writer recognizes that a cer-tain combination of words may produce, in another context, a meaning that is more than the sum of its parts. Later, when an apposite phrase is needed to strike a particular note, this combination may be retrieved from memory (or from a trusty note-book), if it has been recorded and suitably indexed. writers  X  X hirk X  their responsibility to be  X  X crupu-lous X  in their use of language by  X  X imply throwing [their] mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in X . For Orwell, words just get in the way, and should be kept at arm X  X  length until the writer has first allowed a clear meaning to crystallize. This is dubious advice, as one expects a creative writer to keep an open mind when consi d-ering all the possibilities that present themselves. Yet Orwell X  X  proscription suggests how a computer should go about the task of harvesting readymades from corpora: by throwing its mind open to the possibility that a given ngram may one day have a second life as a creative readymade in another context, the computer allows the phrases that match some simple image-building criteria to come crowding in, so they can be stored in a database. types and their properties, computers are capable of indexing and recalling a considerably larger body of resonant combinations than the average human. The necessary barrage of linguistic stimuli can be provided by the Google 1T database of Web ngrams (Brants and Franz, 2006). Trawling these ngrams, a modestly creative computer can reco g-nize well-formed combinations of cultural ele-ments that might serve as a vivid vehicle of description in a future comparison. For every phrase P in the ngrams, where P combines stereo-type nouns and/or adjectival modifiers, the com-puter simply poses the following question: is there an unstated property A such that the simile  X  as A as P  X  is a meaningful and memorable comparison? The property A can be simple, as in  X  X s dark as a chocolate espresso X , or complex, as in  X  X s dark and sophisticated as a chocolate martini X . In either case, the phrase P is tucked away, and indexed un-der the property A until such time as the computer needs to produce a vivid evocation of A .
 potential readymades in the Web ngrams: (1) Noun S1 Noun S2 (2) Noun S1 Noun S2 (3) Adj A Noun S More complex structures for P are also possible, as in the phrases  X  a lake of tears  X  (a melancholy way to accentuate the property  X  X et X ) and  X  a statue in a library  X  (for  X  X ilent X  and  X  X uiet X ). In this current description, we focus on 2-gram phrases only. http://www.educatedinsolence.com/jigsaw Using these patterns, our application  X  the Jigsaw Bard (see Figure 1)  X  pre-builds a vast collection of figurative similes well in advance of the time it is asked to use or suggest any of them. Each phrase P is syntactically well-formed, and because P oc-curs relatively frequently on the Web, it is likely to be semantically well-formed as well. Just as Duchamp side-stepped the need to physically originate an ything, but instead appropriated pre-fabricated artifacts, the Bard likewise side-steps the need for natural-language generation. Each phrase it proposes has the ring of linguistic authenticity; because this authenticity is rooted in another, more literal context, the Bard also exhibits its own Duchamp-like (if Duchamp-lite ) creativity. We now consider the scale of the Bard  X  X  genera-tivity, and the quality of its insights. The vastness of the web, captured in the large-scale sample that is the Google ngrams, means the Jigsaw Bard finds considerable grist for its mill in the phrases that match (1)...(3). Thus, the most restrictive pattern, pattern (1), harvests approx. 20,000 phrases from the Google 2-grams, for a l-most a thousand simple properties (indexing an average of 29 phrases under each property, such as  X  swan song  X  for  X  beautiful  X ). Pattern (2)  X  which allows a blend of stereotypes to be indexed under a complex property  X  harvests approx. 170,000 phrases from the 2-grams, for approx. 70,000 com-plex properties (indexing an average of 12 phrases under each, such as  X  hospital bed  X  for  X  comfort-able and safe  X ). Pattern (3)  X  which pairs a stereo-type noun with an adjective that draws out a salient property of the stereotype  X  is similarly productive: it harvests approx. 150,000 readymade 2-grams for over 2,000 simple properties (indexing an average of 125 phrases per property, as in  X  youthful knight  X  for  X  X eroic X  and  X  zealous convert  X  for  X  X evout X ). tive thesaurus: for any given property (or blend of properties) selected by the user, the Bard presents a range of apt similes constructed from linguistic readymades. The numbers above show that, recall-wise, the Bard has sufficient coverage to work robustly as a thesaurus. Quality-wise, users must make their own determinations as to which similes are most suited to their descriptive purposes, yet it is important that suggestions provided by the Bard are sensible and well-motivated. As such, we must be empirically satisfied about two key intuitions: first, that salient properties are indeed acquired from the Web for our vocabulary of stereotypes (this point relates to the aptness of the similes sug-gested by the Bard ); and second, that the adjectives connected by the SlipNet really do mutually rein-force each other (this point relates to the coherence of complex properties, and to the ability of ready -mades to accentuate unstated prop erties).
 (1989) dictionary of affect, a psycholinguistic re-source used for sentiment analysis that assigns a pleasantness score of between 1.0 (least pleasant) and 3.0 (most pleasant) to over 8,000 commo n-place words. We should thus be able to predict the pleasantness of a stereotype noun (like fish ) using a weighted average of the pleasantness of its salient properties (like cold , slippery ). We should also be able to predict the pleasantness of an adjective u s-ing a weighted average of the pleasantness of its adjacent adjectives in the SlipNet. (In each case, weights are provided by relevant web frequencies.) 0.05) to compare the predictions made in each case to the actual pleasantness scores provided by Whissell X  X  dictionary, and thereby assess the qual-ity of the knowledge used to make the predictions. In the first case, predictions of the pleasantness of stereotype nouns based on the pleasantness of their salient properties (i.e., predicting the pleasantness of Y from the Xs in  X  as X as Y  X ) have a positive correlation of 0.5 with Whissell; conversely, ironic properties yield a negative correlation of  X 0.2 . In the second, predictions of the pleasantness of ad-jectives based on their relations in the SlipNet (i.e., predicting the pleasantness of X from the Ys in  X  as X and Y as  X ) have a positive correlation of 0.7 . Though pleasantness is just one dimension of lex i-cal affect, it is one that requires a broad knowledge of a word, its usage and its denotations to acc u-rately estimate. In this respect, the Bard is well served by a large stock of stereotypes and a coher-ent network of informative properties. Fishlov (1992) has argued that poetic similes re p-resent a conscious deviation from the norms of non-poetic comparison. His analysis shows that poetic similes are longer and more elaborate, and are more likely to be figurative and to flirt with incongruity. Creative similes do not necessarily use words that are longer, or rarer, or fancier, but use many of the same cultural building blocks as non-creative similes. Armed with a rich vocabulary of building blocks, the Jigsaw Bard harvests a great many readymade phrases from the Google ngrams  X  from the evocative  X  X hocolate martini X  to the seemingly incongruous  X  X obot fish X   X  that can be used to evoke an wide range of properties.
 robust. However, any creativity we may attribute to it comes not from the phrases themselves  X  they are readymades, after all  X  but from the recognition of the subtle and often complex properties they evoke. The Bard exploits a sweet-spot in our un -derstanding of linguistic creativity, and so, as pre-sented here, is merely a starting point for our continued exploitation of linguistic readymades, rather than an end in itself. By harvesting more complex syntactic structures, and using more s o-phisticated techniques for analyzing the figurative potential of these phrases, the Bard and its ilk may gradually approach the levels of poeticity dis -cussed by Fishlov. For now, it is sufficient that even simple techniques serve as the basis of a r o-bust and practical thesaurus application. The Jigsaw Bard is designed to be a lightweight application that compiles its comprehensive data-base of readymades in advance.
