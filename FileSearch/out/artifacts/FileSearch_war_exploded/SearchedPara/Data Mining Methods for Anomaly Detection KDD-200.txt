Melbourne, F L 32901 For many applications, data mini ng sy stems are required to detect anomalous (abnormal, unmodeled, or unexpected) observations. anomalies are usually considered to be  X  X on-normal X  observations, where  X  norm ality  X  is ty pically defined by very com plex concepts . Becaus e of thes e and other reas ons , there are no standard and principled approach es for anomaly detection, y et, and the data mining processes that have led to successful solutions include m ost of the tim es ad-hoc (algorithmic, design, and im plem entation) decisions that in corporate prior or commonsense knowledge about the tasks that are addressed. Consequently , we considered that it would be beneficial for both researchers and practitioners intere sted in anom aly detection and data mining, to organize works hop that would bring together International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining would be a good venue for such a workshop because of the diversity of interests, backgrounds, and problems that motivate people to attend the conference. This paper describes the work shop on  X  X ata Mining Methods for Anomaly Detection X   X  a one day event held in conjunction with KDD-2005 in Chicago, on August 21, 2005. Anomalies, detection of anomalie s in data, data mining, machine learning. The KDD-2005 workshop on  X  X ata Mining Methods for Anomaly Detection X  aimed to e xplore research efforts on data mining, machine learning, and rela ted techniques that address the problem of detecting anomalies in data. The workshop was also an attem pt to study the com mon tasks that need to be addressed in practical applications that requi re anomaly detection (AD) tools and algorithms such as data collection, sampling, and pre-processing. Our main goals were to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in anom aly detection and to create a one-day forum for dis cussing recent advances in this area. W e wanted to come to a better understanding of the practical challenges in developing and deploy ing data mining sy stems for anomaly detection and to inspire research on principled methods and techniques for detecting and pred icting anom alies. Finally , we hoped to foster collaborations between AD researchers and those who had a need for AD  X  to bring together the data miners with the data stakeholders.  X  X hat is an Anom aly ? X  This was the firs t ques tion the audience was asked during the opening remark s at the beginning of the day . The ans wers ranged from  X  X hree s tandard deviations away from the mean/norm al X  to  X  X utliers X  to  X  X bnorm alities that are different from outliers X . The definitions proposed by the workshop organizers are: - X  Anomalies are occurrences of even ts that are unusual and - X  Anomalies are events that are not expected bas ed on the - X  X n anomaly is an event that deviates substantially from a - X  Anomalies are observations (or seri es of observations) with Thes e ans wers reflected the divers e interes ts of the people in the audience and the different motivations for their attending the workshop. We learned that most of the people in the audience were interested in this workshop because they were interested in addressing a particular appli cation problem that involved detecting anom alies, rather than in attem pting to address a large or general class of different anomaly detection tasks. The submissions, the reviews, and our discussions prior to the workshop reflected that all of us -researchers and practitioners interested in data mining and learning methods for AD -ty pically have certain beliefs regarding the best approaches (algorithms, param eter settings , etc.) for a s pecific tas k. Thes e beliefs are usually based on previous experi ence on other applications, data sets, and tasks. In practice, however, the practicalities of a real-world problem can dram atically change the approach we take. The organizers X  desire was to ha ve a day of presentations and discussions on: We hope that the presentations a nd discussions we had during this workshop will contribute to near-term steps in our com munity in addres sing thes e is sues. The workshop program included two invited talks and fourteen contributed presentations. All materials related to the workshop are available from the workshop website: http://www. dmargineantu.net/AD-KDD05 . The invited speaker of the morning session of the workshop, was Ted Se nator , a program manager with the Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United S tates (DARP A). A common problem encountered in automated anomaly or rare-event detection is the large num ber of fals e alarm s (or fals e positives) com puted by the algorithm s. Practice has shown that virtually all techniques that rely on a single stage approach (i.e., a single run of an algorithm) can reduce the number of false positives only at the (ty pically very high) expense of not detecting the anom alies. Based on this r ealization, our invited speaker presented his research on several approaches based on classification algorithm s that reduce the num ber of false positive instances and in the m eantim e in crease the true positive rate. The techniques presented in this talk were all based on two clas sification s tages and were des cribed by a unified architecture that allows different levels of com plexity . The speaker pres ented experimental results on counte r-terrorism data and on HIV-positive detection that show em pirically that the proposed m ulti-stage classification m ethods exhibit im proved accuracy especially in detecting extrem ely rare phe nomena, and provide a reduction of false positives, over standa rd single stage approaches. The invited talk of the afternoon session was given by Ray Somorjai , a scientist with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), in Winnipeg. The focus in this presentation was the detection of outliers in highl y-dim ensional spaces, especially when the number of labeled obs ervation is sm all. For the detection of the outliers, the speak er X  X  approach is to em ploy different metrics for mapping the points into lower dimensional spaces and to em ploy a voting m echanis m over the different mappings for the final decisions. The talk explored different mapping functions and analy zed their outlier detection capabilities on bio-m edical data. Weng-Keen Wong (the presente r) and his colleagues (Gregory Cooper, Denver Dash, John Leva nder, John Dowling, William Hogan, and Michael Wagner) have developed an algorithm  X  PANDA (Population-wide Anomaly De tection and Assessment)  X  designed to monitor health-care data and detect the inception of outbreaks caused by an outdoor, airborne release of inhalational anthrax. PANDA is basically a causal Bay esian network approach capable of incorporating m ultiple sources of data, dom ain knowledge, different ty pes of evid ence and, besides detecting the outbreaks , is capable of explaining the evidence that contributes most likely to its conclusions. Until the beginning of last century , the term anom aly was used exclusively in describing abnorma l movement of celestial objects. This talk (given by Peter Zimmer, and co-authored by John McGraw and their CTI-II computing collective colleagues from the University of New Mexico) described a large astronomical dataset that consists of images (approximately 200 gigapixels per night of operation) collected ove r a seven y ear period. Another database of parameters derive d from the im ages , as well as of a challenge coming from our colleagues working in astronomy . Having these databases available, will allow anom aly detection researchers to have a common ground for testing their methods and m ay help astronom ers to discover interesting new space objects. Chris Drummond and Robert Holte addressed the problem of employ ing classification algorithms for highly imbalanced data (exhibiting class imbalances of 100:1, 1000:1 or higher). Two of the issues the practitioner has to address in these cases are that standard classification algorithms were not deigned to deal with severe data imbalance and that standard perform ance evaluation meas ures such as the m isclas sification rate are irrelevant. The authors further argue that the em phasis in dealing with high class im balance should be on the costs/utilities of the decisions associated with the outputs of the clas sifier. If the end us er is unhappy with the number of false al arms the only realistic answer may be to dem ons trate that cos t calculations show that capturing a real event is worth any costs asso ciated with the false positives. Matthew Mahoney and Philip Chan addressed the problem of online detection of anomalous modes of m echanical failure, by employ ing only a small set of tim e series data from norm al operation modes. The authors propos ed two efficient techniques  X  path modeling and box modeling  X  that allow online scoring (during testing). These techni ques were tested on two NASA shuttle valve datasets  X  TEK and VT1 (solenoid current and voltage m eas urem ents recorded on s mall valves that are used for actuating larger valves that contro l the fuel flow to space shuttle engines) against three other methods (Euclidean distance, dy namic time warping, and Gec ko). The newly proposed methods outperformed the other methods on one of the datasets (TEK), and tied the performance of the other methods on the other domain (VT1). Path m odeling has proven to be more accurate than box modeling, whereas the latter is significantly faster. In Don Hush X  X  talk (joint work with Patrick Kelly , Clint Scovel, and Ingo Steinwart), he presented a summary of their ongoing work on the theoretical underpinnings of anomaly detection. In this talk, bas ed on their recent J MLR paper on the s ubject, Hus h form ulated the anom aly detection problem in terms of minimizing an expected error criterion, S(f) , for a fixed AD classifier, f , defined as being the symmetric difference between the region clas sified as anom alous by f and the  X  X rue X  anomalous region. The traditional difficulty with this form ulation is that S(f) is Hush et al. demonstrate a risk function, R(f) , that upper bounds S(f) and that can be estim ated from data. This surprising result classification task and leads to the  X  DLD X  (density level detection) support vector-based learning algorithm for AD. The authors gave empirical demons trations that their algorithm yielded com petitive or stronger perform ance on a cybersecurity anomaly detection domain, as com pared to a num ber of previously published AD approaches. Kazumi Saito and Naonori Ueda address the problem of detecting search engine s pam , which are we bsites that contain no relevant information but score highly on a search engine X  X  ranking solely because of a densely connected link structure. They attem pt to detect spam websites by finding ne twork cores which is a set of sites whose connections are anom alously dense. They take an iterative approach by computing the eigenvectors of the network adjacency m atrix, identify ing an anom alous ly dens e subs et, removing it, and repeating the process. The joint work of Marco-Antonio Balderas, Fernando Berzal, Juan-Carlos Cubero, Eduardo Eisman, and Nicol X s Mar X n on "Discovering Hidden Associati on Rules", addressed anomaly detection in the context of the traditional KDD question of association rule mining. As has been widely noted in the data m ining literature, association rule mining algorithms tend to produce a large number of often redundant rules. In the AD context, however, we are interested that describe interesting out-of-t he-norm cases. Further, such cas es are often infrequent . This group proposed the definition that an anom alous association rule is a rule that is confident only in the abs ence of a rule that is both confident and frequent. For example, if a confident and frequent rule is "if s ymptom -X then dis eas e-Y", then an anom alous cas e m ight appear when the consequent doesn' t hold: "if sy mptom-X and _not_ disease-Y then disease-A". Such rules are constrained to be confident, but need not have strong support, as we are interes ted in pos sibly rare anom alies . The authors dem ons trated the ATBAR (Anom aly TBAR) algorithm : a rule-mining proces s that can extract s uch relations . They showed the perform ance of ATBAR on a variety of m edical clas sification problems drawn from the UCI databa se, dem onstrating that it was able to extract com pact anom aly rule s ets from m oderately large data sets. Auroop Ganguly  X  X  talk (joint work with Tailen Hsing, Rick Katz, David Erickson, George Ostrouc hov Thomas Wilbanks, and Noel Cressie) discussed m ultivariate spatio-tem poral dependencies between extreme and unusual valu es, as well as sudden changes in climate data. The authors have provided an overview of current approaches and of technical challenges for the data mining community . They also presented their work on visualization and quantification of m ultivariate dependences between anom alous values . Daniel Neill (the presenter) and Andrew Moore have given the audience a detailed overview of their generalized spatial scan fram ework for the task of detecting spatial clusters. This task involves identify ing locations, shapes, and sizes of potentially anom alous regions of points in s pace, and dis crim inating between real clus ters and chance occurrences of points in a region. The steps of the generalized s patial s can are des cribed below and include  X  Gathering data for a set of spatial locations. The goal is to  X  Choosing the set of spatial regions to search over.

She discusses the current practice which is based on traditiona l statistical methods such as statis tical proces s control and autoregressive time series models but notes that these methods de pend on strong assumptions which are alm ost alway s fals e. Cons equently , she exam ines similar problems in related fields, surv eys their methods, and discusses whether the field of biosurveillence can borrow techniques from their work. Matthew Otey , Srinivasan Parthasarathy , and Amol Ghoting presented an em pirical com parison of three outlier detection methods on an intrusion detecti on data set. The three methods they com pared were Orca, a distance based outlier detection method, LOADED, a method based on computing an itemset lattice, and RELOADED, a method based on using classifiers to model dependencies between features. They exam ine the quality of the results, execution time, and memory requirements. Maheshkumar Sabhnani has presente d his joint work with Daniel Neill and Andrew Moore on a bio-surveillance sy stem they developed for daily monitori ng of over-the-counter pharmacy sales and detecting anomalous patte rns that may be indicators of dis eas e outbreaks . Com plex trends (seas onal, day -of-week, etc.) in the pharm acy sales data, m issing data, partial lack of labels, and the high costs of false positives are only som e of the challenges in developing an auto mated data mining approach for this tas k. The pres ented approach relies on fas t space-tim e s can statistics which is capable of incorporating expert domain knowledge. The authors have de scribed how the sy stem has evolved over time, how differe nt technologies have been incrementally added, and how th ese techniques influenced the accuracy of detecting online the real anom alies in the data collected by a m onitoring sy stem (The National Retail Data Monitor) of the pharmacy data, ope rated at the University of Pittsburgh X  X  Real-tim e Outbreak and Disease Surveillance Laboratory . Gilbert Peterson, Robert Mills , Brent McBride, and W esley Allred investigate the issue of how tightly an anom aly detection system should model behavior of normal examples. Specifically , in an intrusion detection sy stem one could argue that the model of normal class behavior should fit th e data sample as tightly as possible and only cover behavior s that were actually observed since attacks m ight try to m imic the norm al clas s. They investigate this hy pothesis by comparing three different approaches for modeling normal da ta: k-m eans with spheres, k-means with ellipsoids, and conve x poly topes. They discover that although the convex poly tope method develops models that are most specific to the norm al clas s, it can often perform wors e than the k-m eans approach becaus e of generalization is sues. Deepak Agarwal addres sed the probl em of detecting anomalies in cros s-clas sified data s tream s in which each dim ension corresponds to different levels of a categorical variable. The actual tas k motivating the approach is a s peech m ining tas k: to autom atically extract im portant service and business intelligence information from records of dialogs of customers calling an autom ated help desk. The problem addressed in this talk was the detection of changes in the feat ures selected from dialogues.
