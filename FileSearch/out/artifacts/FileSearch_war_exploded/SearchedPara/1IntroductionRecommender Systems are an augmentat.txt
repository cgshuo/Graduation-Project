Recommender Systems are an augmentation of the social process in which we rely on advices or suggestions from other people [Resnick and Varian 1997]. As collabora-tive filtering has taken over more traditional content-based approaches to become the most common technique for recommender systems, one can argue that most recom-mender systems are social recommender systems, which consider the social environ-ment of the users.

However, by Social Recommender Systems, we specifically refer to recommender systems that target the social media domain. With the proliferation of social media sites (a phenomenon commonly referred to as Web 2.0), including social networking sites, blogging and microblogging systems, wikis, photo and video sharing sites, collab-orative editing of content, social news reading, social bookmarking, and more, users of the Web are exposed to social overload. As opposed to information overload, social overload also implies interaction overload where users of these sites often interact with an ever-growing number of friends, followers, and followees, not to mention the over-whelming amounts of content produced with or without tags, comments, or ratings.
Social Recommender Systems (SRSs) aim at coping with the challenge of social over-load by adapting information and interaction to the needs and preferences of individ-ual users. SRSs also aim at increasing adoption and engagement of new and existing social media sites. SRSs include recommendations of a wide variety of items, including but not limited to the recommendation of social media content, such as blogs, wikis, or feeds, recommendation of tags to annotate or keep track of content, recommendation of people to connect with, to follow, or to get to know, and recommendation of groups and communities to join and engage.

Social media and recommender systems can mutually benefit from one another. On the one hand, social media introduces new types of data and metadata, such as tags, comments, votes, and explicit people relationships, which can be utilized to enhance recommendations. On the other hand, recommender systems can significantly impact the success of social media, ensuring that each user is presented with the most relevant items (e.g., content or people) that suit his/her personal needs.

To highlight the work in this emerging area, this special issue includes four article, covering very different aspects of SRSs. Lipczak and Milios study tag recommendation over a rich set of social tagging systems. Their proposed hybrid approach combines five recommenders that consider both the content of the resource and the underlying folksonomy. A feedback loop also allows the system to adapt the recommendations to the tags entered by the user. In our second article, Vasuki et al. consider recommenda-tion of communities based on both the membership and the friendship network. They suggest that the concept of affiliation need not be limited to community affiliation. It shows that friendship information can help enhance recommendation. A graph-based algorithm is then used for recommending a ffiliation. In the third entry, McNally et al. present a system called HeyStaks, which recommends documents based on results that others have found in similar searches. The authors propose a reputation model for Heystak that utilizes the implicit collaboration events between users when recommendations are made. In our last article, Zhao et al. describe a system called Pharos, which recommends a social map of content-centric social sites for users (new users, in particular) to get a glimpse at the social activities of the site and to guide the users to navigate the site based on these social activities. In their notion, a social map summarizes users X  content-related social behavior over time (e.g., reading, writing, and commenting behavior during the past week) as a set of latent communities. These derived communities then serve as a context for users to get to know the site (content and people) and act upon it (e.g., to join a discussion).

The table below summarizes the four articles in this special issue, by the recom-mended entities, the data used as the basis for recommendation, and the social media systems with which experimentation was performed.

Looking forward, there are still many challenges remaining in this space, as social overload keeps growing and distinguishing the most relevant and attractive items (e.g., content, people, and communities) from noisy data will become ever more difficult. On the other hand, social media users X  expectations from SRSs are also increasing, and their behavior on the sites becomes more and more dependant on the site X  X  ability to make effective recommendations. We therefore believe SRS-related research will grow in the years to come, helping to develop more powerful systems that will change the way Web users behave today.
