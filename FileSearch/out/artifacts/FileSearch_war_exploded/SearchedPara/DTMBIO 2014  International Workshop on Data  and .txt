 Held each year in conjunction with one of the largest data management conferences, CIKM, the Eighth ACM International Workshop on Data and Text Mini ng in Biomedical Informatics (DTMBIO 14) is organized to bring together researchers interested in development and application of cutting-edge biomedical and healthcare techno logy. The purpose of DTMBIO is to foster discussions regarding the state-of-the-art applications of data and text mining on biomedical rese arch problems. DTMBIO 14 will help scientists navigate emerging trends and opportunities in the evolving area of informatics related techniques and problems in the context of biomedical research.

Biomedical data mining presents obstacles unseen in other fields that deal with large datasets. Biological data are more heterogeneous stemming from a wide range of experiments that generate many types of informa tion, such as genetic sequences, interactions of proteins or findings in medical records. Acquiring the most useful information from this complex data and interpreting them in light of all the relevant prior knowledge remains a challenging task. The aim of the 2014 workshop has been to bring together researchers in the areas of data and text mining and computational biolog y, who are interested in integrating and analyzing heterogeneous, structured and unstructured data. world. The selection process was highly competitive. Each paper went through a rigorous double-blinded peer review by at least 3 members of the Program Committee. Based on the referee reports, the papers were ranked according to their original contribution, and the program committee accepted 7 papers and 4 short papers (which will be invited to a s upplement issue of BMC Decision Making and Medical Informatics) th at cover a variety of topics, including novel information extrac tion techniques, ontologies, and application to large biomedical data. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Doheon Lee at KAIST. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers who are interested in applying Text Mining to Medical Informatics. Session 1 presents research pertinent to various data and text mining techniques in the biomedical domain. [1] uses brain pathway information from literature incorporated into pathway activity inference procedure to classify patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This study could impact interpreta tion of cognitive alterations and functional declines during AD progression. [2] analyzes loss and gain of function mutations to identif y properties distinct to each of the two classes. By implementing classifications with the selected features, it is demonstrated that the selected fe atures have good discriminative power. Empirical determination of whether a mutation confers loss or gain of function to the protein is desirable since it could conserve resources for bench scientists. To characterize molecular level commonality among brain diseases that share symptoms at the clinical level, [3] performed integrative gene expression analysis using a correlation-based biclustering approach. The results in this study provide valuable resources to show the common key molecular pl ayers affecting brain diseases in a transnosological manner as well as gene sets specific to each disease. Pathway analysis is a fundamental aspect for understanding the molecular mechanis ms that underlie biological processes. [4] provides analysis of conflicting information as well as resolution in pathways as a means of maintaining robustness and integrity in biological data bases. This pathway database cleaning in important for better secondary analyses such as qualitative/quantitative simulation. [5] provides two methods to identify subtypes of cancer on the basis of somatic mutations found in them. Stratification of pati ents into distinct tumor types informs the prognosis as well as preferred treatments for the patient. Identif ication of virulence factors of pathogens can potentially help in appropriate tr eatment options during infections. [6] performs comparative genome analysis between virulent and non-virulent strains and determines that effects of genomic variations in the protein-coding regions are less significant than those on the regulatory regions. [7] proposes an approach to identify novel drug targets for E3 lig ases by integrating networks of E3-substrates and neighboring known disease genes. The methodology is also generally applic able to mechanistic studies of the genes of interest. Session 2 presents research in the area of text mining in the biomedical informatics fiel d. Mapping of narrative text automatically to pre-defined codes would facilitate easy conversion for reporting purposes. [8] proposes use of a Non-Negative Matrix-Factorization mode l based method for the task in an emergency department setting and show that it outperforms other classifiers. [9] present a novel unsupervised collective inference approach to link entities from unstructured full texts of biomedical literature to 300 onto logies. Automatic Entity Linking (EL) problem in the life scien ce domain is largely unexplored. The approach leverages the ri ch semantic information and structures in ontologies for similarity computation and entity ranking. [10] investigates the perf ormance of three state-of-the-art parsers: the Stanford parser, th e Bikel parser, and the Charniak parser, using two clinical datasets. The study demonstrates that re-training using clinical Treebanks is critical for improving general English parsers X  performance on clinical text, and combining clinical and open domain corpora might achieve optimal performance for pars ing clinical text. [11] proposes a robust hybrid approach for extracting relations on the basis of a rule-based approach feature set for PPI using public corpora. Automatic relation extraction from biomedical text is the focus of intense research in recent years. organized in conjunction with CIKM in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. We invite researchers and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds such as computer science, information system, information science, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and medical sciences. The main objective of the workshop will be to strengthen the cooperation within the growing community in medical da ta and text mining research, allowing lively exchange of idea s and foster new collaborations.
