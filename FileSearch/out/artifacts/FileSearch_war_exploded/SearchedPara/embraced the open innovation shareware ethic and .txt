 embraced the open innovation shareware ethic and in so doing have built a new business around it  X  IBM for example with LINUX, but most companies are just starting to understand this movement and most have not even begun. Yet, understand they must and so too must governments, since this is not just about the open source movement and non-market forces impacting business, it is also about empowerment impinging on pol-itics, law, human rights, justice and global opportunity.

Benkler sees the future of the digital global economy, neither as dystopia, nor utopia, but pragmatically as a new and different era radically changed from the purely industrial production economies of the recent past and present. This is not a new idea, but he states it so much more rationally, logically and factually than many of his predecessors. His take on topics such as the Babel objection to the Internet is as clean and empirical an analysis as one can find. Throughout the book you have to admire the articulation of his arguments, even if you may not fully agree with his conclusions.

The book has three parts. Part one, The Networked Information Economy , is very well done and the chap-ters on P2P and the economics of social production are very good reviews for some and will provide insight-ful introductions to these topics for others. Part two, The Political Economy of Property and Commons ,hasa chapter entitled  X  X  X ustice and Development X  X  that is as overall thought provoking as it is compelling. Part three, Policies of Freedom at a Moment of Transformation , concludes with the final chapter,  X  X  X he Stakes of Information Law and Policy X  X , that will be of interest to practitioners, as well as for the more general reader.

The text is 475 pages, but it is well worth the effort to get through it. The writing is mostly clear, but in places it is admittedly turgid. The density stems from the fact that every sentence matters  X  there are no breaks for the reader  X  Benkler has a lot to say this is a core dump. In keeping with the subject matter and thesis, the book was published under a Creative Commons license.

This book could be the basis for a superb graduate level course in any of the i-schools; maybe it could even be taught in conjunction with law colleagues. Outside of academia  X  corporate professionals need to read this for a different point of view than the standard fare that emerges from business schools on this and related topics.

However, you look at it  X  this book is worth reading, but it may be a little heavy for the beach  X  but not for the summer! Intelligent Internet Knowledge Networks: Processing of Concepts and Wisdom. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey. October 2006, ISBN:-10: 0 471 78856 2
Dr. Ahamed brings about a dramatic confluence of human intelligence, Internet, knowledge environments and broadband networks in his most recent book. A brief look back over the last couple of decades into the evolution of the knowledge society reminds us that the current designs of computing machines deserve a long hard look into the philosophy of their purpose, design, and utilization. Much like the fiber optic technology that has altered our perception of communication networks, the architectures proposed by Dr. Ahamed in this book can cause a jolt in the perception of what a new breed of computing machines and communication networks can do for us.

The contention that is emphatic in the book is that the modern machines can be enhanced to positively serve the evolving needs of the modern human being. The common wage-earner in the knowledge society is dragged into an information revolution that is insidious, dynamic and shaped by the high-speed information communication and media networks. In a sense, Dr. Ahamed implies that the extent of social change that accompanies Intelligent Internets and knowledge networks will bring about a change that is as momentous as the socioeconomic change that the industrial revolution brought to the farmers in the Eighteenth and Nine-teenth centuries. The industrial revolution offered more time to the wage earners to pursue the intellectual needs of the twentieth century. In the same vane, the knowledge revolution also offers more time for the urban workers to pursue needs beyond the Maslow X  X  realization needs and look at the global problems of finding peace and joy in the modern society, global warming, depleting Ozone layer in the skies, eradication of hunger and poverty around the globe, and even address questions such as bringing peace and justice to the global world community.

For this reason, the author of this book has proposed machine architectures that address the very human questions such as distilling wisdom and perceiving concepts by working together with human beings and experts. In such a combined capacity, Dr. Ahamed asserts that the human machine team will address questions such as seeking the optimality of medical networks in hospitals, or designing electronic governments for developing countries, find cure for cancer, etc. The role of the machines is that of tireless knowledge processing, computing, communication, and WWW partner to the creative minds of human beings.

In this book, the process of designing computer architectures is extrapolated to innovative machines that will serve an array of human needs in two ways. First, the author suggests that these machines distill axioms of wisdom from events in society in order to achieve progress in a peaceful and harmonious way.
Second, the machines will look ahead to the needs of general populations from snapshots of present sta-tus and propose long term strategies that will dilute the severity of problems when and if they should occur.

I can commend the author for taking the bold initiative to write this book involving many diversified disciplines such as computer science, social science, economics and mathematics. The book brings home the point that human struggle to create and contribute to modern society for some can be as strong as the primitive needs of hunger and thirst for all. Such a strong higher level need that the proposed machine will bring to an educated populous of any nation will unfold newer and brighter horizons for all human beings.
