 Unlike western languages, Chinese is unique due to its logographic writing system. Chinese users cannot directly type in Chinese words using a QW-ERTY keyboard. Pinyin is the official system to transcribe Chinese characters into the Latin alpha-bet. Based on this transcription system, Pinyin input methods have been proposed to assist users to type in Chinese words (Chen, 1997).

The typical way to type in Chinese words is in a sequential manner (Wang et al., 2001). As-sume users want to type in the Chinese word  X   X   X  (what) X . First, they mentally generate and type in corresponding Pinyin  X  X henme X . Then, a Chinese Pinyin input method displays a list of Chinese words which share that Pinyin, as shown in Fig. 1. Users Figure 1: Typical Chinese Pinyin input method for a correct Pinyin (Sogou-Pinyin).
 Figure 2: Typical Chinese Pinyin input method for a mistyped Pinyin (Sogou-Pinyin). visually search the target word from candidates and select numeric key  X 1 X  to get the result. The last t-wo steps do not exist in typing process of English words, which indicates that it is more complicated for Chinese users to type in Chinese words.
Chinese users may make errors when they are typ-ing in Chinese words. As shown in Fig. 2, a user may mistype  X  X henme X  as  X  shenem  X . Typical Chi-nese Pinyin input method can not return the right word. Users may not realize that an error occurs and select the first candidate word  X   X  X  X  X   X  (a mean-ingless word) as the result. This greatly limits us-er experience since users have to identify errors and modify them, or cannot get the right word.

In this paper, we analyze the reasons that cause errors in Chinese Pinyin input method. This analy-sis is helpful in enhancing the user experience and the performance of Chinese Pinyin input method. In practice, users press backspace on the keyboard to modify the errors, they delete the mistyped word and re-type in the correct word. Motivated by this ob-servation, we can extract error-correction pairs from backspace operations. These error-correction pairs are of great importance in Chinese spelling correc-tion task which generally relies on sets of confusing words.

We extract 54 , 309 , 334 error-correction pairs from user input behaviors and further study them. Our comparative analysis of Chinese and English ty-pos suggests that some language-specific properties of Chinese lead to a part of input errors. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one which analyzes user input behaviors in Chinese Pinyin in-put method.
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related works. Section 3 intro-duces how we collect errors in Chinese Pinyin input method. In Section 4, we investigate the reasons that result in these errors. Section 5 concludes the whole paper and discusses future work. For English spelling correction (Kukich, 1992; Ahmad and Kondrak, 2005; Chen et al., 2007; Whitelaw et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2010), most ap-proaches make use of a lexicon which contains a list of well-spelled words (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005; Islam and Inkpen, 2009). Context features (Ro-zovskaya and Roth, 2010) of words provide useful evidences for spelling correction. These features are usually represented by an n -gram language mod-el (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004; Wilcox-O X  X earn et al., 2010). Phonetic features (Toutanova and Moore, 2002; Atkinson, 2008) are proved to be useful in En-glish spelling correction. A spelling correction sys-tem is trained using these features by a noisy channel model (Kernighan et al., 1990; Ristad et al., 1998; Brill and Moore, 2000).

Chang (1994) first proposes a representative ap-proach for Chinese spelling correction, which re-lies on sets of confusing characters. Zhang et al. (2000) propose an approximate word-matching al-gorithm for Chinese to solve Chinese spell detec-tion and correction task. Zhang et al. (1999) present a winnow-based approach for Chinese spelling cor-rection which takes both local language features and wide-scope semantic features into account. Lin and Yu (2004) use Chinese frequent strings and report an accuracy of 87 . 32% . Liu et al. (2009) show that about 80% of the errors are related to pronunciation-s. Visual and phonological features are used in Chi-nese spelling correction (Liu et al., 2010).
Instead of proposing a method for spelling cor-rection, we mainly investigate the reasons that cause typing errors in both English and Chinese. Some errors are caused by specific properties in Chinese such as the phonetic difference between Mandarin and dialects spoken in southern China. Meanwhile, confusion sets of Chinese words play an importan-t role in Chinese spelling correction. We extract a large scale of error-correction pairs from real user input behaviors. These pairs contain important ev-idence about confusing Pinyins and Chinese words which are helpful in Chinese spelling correction. We analyze user input behaviors from anonymous user typing records in a Chinese input method. Data set used in this paper is extracted from Sogou Chi-nese Pinyin input method 1 . It contains 2 , 277 , 786 users X  typing records in 15 days. The numbers of Chinese words and characters are 3 , 042 , 637 , 537 and 5 , 083 , 231 , 392 , respectively. We show some user typing records in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3, we can see the typing process of a Chinese sentence  X   X  X  X  X  X   X  (What is this). Each line represents an input segment or a backspace op-eration. For example, word  X   X  X   X  (what) is type-d in using Pinyin  X  X henme X  with numeric selection  X 1 X  at 11:10am in Microsoft Word application. The user made a mistake to type in the third Pinyin ( X  X henme X  is mistyped as  X  shenem  X ). Then, he/she pressed the backspace to modify the errors he has made. the word  X   X  X  X  X   X  is deleted and re-placed with the correct word  X   X  X   X  using Pinyin  X  X henme X . As a result, we compare the typed-in Pinyins before and after backspace operations. We can find the Pinyin-correction pairs  X  X henem-shenme X , since their edit distance is less than a threshold. Threshold is set to 2 in this paper, as Damerau (1964) shows that about 80% of typos are caused by a single edit operation. Therefore, using a threshold of 2 , we should be able to find most of the typos. Furthermore, we can extract corresponding Chinese word-correction pairs  X   X  X  X  X  - X  X   X  from this typing record.

Using heuristic rules discussed above, we extrac-t 54 , 309 , 334 Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs. We list some examples of extracted Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs in Table 1. Most of the mistyped Chinese words are meaningless.
 Table 1: Typical Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs.

We want to evaluate the precision and recall of our extraction method. For precision aspect, we ran-domly select 1 , 000 pairs and ask five native speak-ers to annotate them as correct or wrong. Annota-tion results show that the precision of our method is about 75 . 8% . Some correct Pinyins are labeled as errors because we only take edit distance into con-sideration. We should consider context features as well, which will be left as our future work.
We choose 15 typical mistyped Pinyins to evalu-ate the recall of our method. The total occurrences of these mistyped Pinyins are 259 , 051 . We success-fully retrieve 144 , 020 of them, which indicates the recall of our method is about 55 . 6% . Some errors are not found because sometimes users do not modi-fy the errors, especially when they are using Chinese input method under instant messenger softwares. In this section, we compare the Pinyin typos and En-glish typos. As shown in (Cooper, 1983), typing er-rors can be classified into four categories: deletions, insertions, substitutions, and transpositions. We aim at studying the reasons that result in these four kinds of typing errors in Chinese Pinyin and English, re-spectively.

For English typos, we generate mistyped word-correction pairs from Wikipedia 2 and SpellGood. 3 , which contain 4 , 206 and 10 , 084 common mis-spellings in English, respectively. As shown in Ta-ble 2, we reach the first conclusion: about half of the typing errors in Pinyin and English are caused by deletions , which indicates that users are more possible to omit some letters than other three edit operations.
 Table 2: Different errors in Pinyin and English.
Table 3 and Table 4 list Top 5 letters that produce deletion errors (users forget to type in some letters) and insertion errors (users type in extra letters) in Pinyin and English.
 Table 3: Deletion errors in Pinyin and English.
Table 4: Insertion errors in Pinyin and English.
We can see from Table 3 and Table 4 that: (1) vowels (a, o, e, i, u) are deleted or inserted more fre-quently than consonants in Pinyin. (2) some specific properties in Chinese lead to insertion and deletion errors. Many users in southern China cannot dis-tinguish the front and the back nasal sound ( X  X ng X  - X  X n X ,  X  X ng X  - X  X n X ,  X  X ng X  - X  X n X ) as well as the retroflex and the blade-alveolar ( X  X h X  - X  X  X ,  X  X h X  - X  X  X ,  X  X h X  - X  X  X ). They are confused about whether they should add letter  X  X  X  or  X  X  X  under these situations. (3) the same letters can occur continuously in English, such as  X  X complish-a cc omplish X  and  X  X dmited-admi tt ed X  in our examples. English users sometimes make in-sertion or deletion errors in these cases. We also observe this kind of errors in Chinese Pinyin, such as  X  X ingai-yin gg ai X ,  X  X iange-lian gg e X  and  X  X ianao-dia nn ao X .

For transposition errors, Table 5 lists Top 10 pat-terns that produce transposition errors in Pinyin and English. Our running example  X  X henem-shenme X  belongs to this kind of errors. We classify the let-ters of the keyboard into two categories, i.e.  X  X eft X  and  X  X ight X , according to their positions on the key-board. Letter  X  X  X  is controlled by left hand while  X  X  X  is controlled by right hand. Users mistype  X  X henme X  as  X  X henem X  because they mistake the typing order of  X  X  X  and  X  X  X .

Fig. 4 is a graphic representation, in which we add a link between  X  X  X  and  X  X  X . The rest patterns in Ta-ble 5 can be done in the same manner. Interestingly, from Fig. 4, we reach the second conclusion: most of the transposition errors are caused by mistak-ing the typing orders across left and right hands . For instance, users intend to type in a letter ( X  X  X ) controlled by right hand. But they type in a letter ( X  X  X ) controlled by left hand instead.
 Table 5: Transpositions errors in Pinyin and English. Figure 4: Transpositions errors on the keyboard.
For substitution errors, we study the reason why users mistype one letter for another. In the Pinyin-correction pairs, users always mistype  X  X  X  as  X  X  X  and vice versa. The reason is that they have similar pro-nunciations in Chinese. As a result, we add two di-rected edges  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  in Fig. 5. Some letters are mistyped for each other because they are adjacent on the keyboard although they do not share similar pronunciations, such as  X  X  X  and  X  X  X .

We summarize the substitution errors in English in Fig. 6. Letters  X  X  X ,  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  are often mixed up with each other because they sound alike in English although they are apart on the keyboard. However, the three letters are not connected in Fig. 5, which indicates that users can easily distinguish them in Pinyin.
 Table 6: Pronunciation properties and keyboard dis-tance in Chinese Pinyin and English
We list some examples in Table 6. For example, letters  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  have similar pronunciations in both Chinese and English. Moreover, they are adja-cent on the keyboard, which leads to interferences or confusion in both Chinese and English. Letters  X  X  X ,  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  are far from each other on the keyboard. But they sound alike in Chinese, which makes them connected in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6, letters  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  are connected to each other because they have simi-lar pronunciations in English, although they are not adjacent on the keyboard.

Finally, we summarize the third conclusion: sub-stitution errors are caused by language specific similarities (similar pronunciations) or keyboard neighborhood (adjacent on the keyboard) .
 All in all, we generally classify typing errors in English and Chinese into four categories and investi-gate the reasons that result in these errors respective-ly. Some language specific properties, such as pro-nunciations in English and Chinese, lead to substitu-tion, insertion and deletion errors. Keyboard layouts play an important role in transposition errors, which are language-independent. In this paper, we study user input behaviors in Chi-nese Pinyin input method from backspace opera-tions. We aim at analyzing the reasons that cause these errors. Users signal that they are very likely to make errors if they press backspace on the key-board. Then they modify the errors and type in the correct words they want. Different from the previous research, we extract abundant Pinyin-correction and Chinese word-correction pairs from backspace op-erations. Compared with English typos, we observe some language-specific properties in Chinese have impact on errors. All in all, user behaviors (Zheng et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2011b) in Chinese Pinyin input method provide novel per-spectives for natural language processing tasks.
Below we sketch three possible directions for the future work: (1) we should consider position fea-tures in analyzing Pinyin errors. For example, it is less likely that users make errors in the first letter of an input Pinyin. (2) we aim at designing a self-adaptive input method that provide error-tolerant features (Chen and Lee, 2000; Zheng et al., 2011a). (3) we want to build a Chinese spelling correction system based on extracted error-correction pairs.
