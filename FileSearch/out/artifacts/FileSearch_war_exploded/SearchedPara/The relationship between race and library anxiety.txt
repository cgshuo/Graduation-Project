 1. Introduction
African Americans in the United States have made much progress in their educational attainment and achievement over the past few decades. Between 1970 and 2001, the high school completion rate for African Americans over the age of 25 increased from 35.4% to 80.6% for males and 36.6% to 78.6% for females.
Their college completion rate also improved from 6.8% to 15.9% for males and 5.6% to 16.3% for females during the same period ( National Center for Education Statistics, 2002, p. 17 ). Although the gap between
African Americans and Caucasian Americans in educational attainment and achievement is closing, the dif-ferences between the two racial groups still persist in the United States ( National Center for Education Sta-tistics, 2003 ).

Many research attempts have been made to explain empirically the observed racial differences in test scores and other academic performance indicators between African-American and Caucasian-American students, including differences in family background ( Brooks-Gunn, Klebanov, &amp; Duncan, 1996; Ceci, 1990; Currie &amp; Thomas, 1995; Johnson, 1989; Venezky, Kaestle, &amp; Sum, 1987 ), socioeconomic status ( Fisher et al., 1996; Kao &amp; Thompson, 2003; Lubienski, 2002 ), neighborhood poverty ( Menacker, 1990; Turley, 2003; Yancey &amp; Saporito, 1997 ), economic resources ( Brooks-Gunn et al., 1996; Crane, 1996;
Fisher et al., 1996; Johnson, 1989 ), school resources ( Bali &amp; Alvarez, 2003; Ferguson, 1990; Kozol, 1991 ), teacher qualifications ( Ehrenberg &amp; Brewer, 1995; Ferguson, 1990, 2003; Wayne &amp; Youngs, 2003 ), academic background ( Johnson, 1989 ), and innate cognitive ability ( Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Lynn, 2002 ).

Racial differences in educational outcomes have not only been found at the public school level, but also been observed repeatedly among college students. However, despite the large volume of literature on racial differences in academic performance between African Americans and Caucasian Americans at the university level, there has been a dearth of research examining whether the academic library experience is an important variable that helps explain the racial differences observed in educational outcomes. Because the academic library is an important component of higher education and provides a significant amount of support for the university  X  s goals, it is generally considered a major element in students  X  learning and success.
In recent years, a few researchers have investigated empirically the differences in academic library expe-riences between African-American and Caucasian-American college students. For example, Whitmire (1999) used the data from the 1992 to 1993 College Student Experiences Questionnaire (CSEQ) to examine differences in the academic library experiences of African-American and Caucasian-American college stu-dents. The results of her study indicated that African-American undergraduate students used the academic library services more frequently than did Caucasian-American students with respect to seven academic li-brary use variables. Thus, the two racial groups had significantly different academic library experiences. In a follow-up study, Whitmire (2003) investigated differences in academic library experiences between Caucasian-American undergraduate students and minority undergraduate students that comprised African
Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. She found that when the 10 variables rep-resenting academic library use of college students were compared, four of them statistically significantly dif-ferentiated the two racial groups, again suggesting racial differences in the academic library experiences of undergraduate students.

Yet, in a longitudinal study of college students  X  library use, Whitmire (2001) reported that while students  X  background characteristics such as gender and race  X  X  X nitially correlated with library use during the fresh-man and sophomore years, they were no longer statistically significant by the junior year X  X  (p. 536). What consistently had an impact on college students  X  library use consisted of their previous experiences using high school libraries, levels of self-reported critical thinking, levels of student X  X aculty interactions, levels of peer interactions, degree of active learning, amount of engaged writing activities, number of term papers written, and the number of hours spent on schoolwork. Indeed, Whitmire (2001) noticed that,  X  X  X ot surpris-ingly, undergraduates who spent more hours on their schoolwork also engaged in more academic library activities. The more academic library activities, the more they used the library X  X  (p. 537). In a related re-search conducted at a doctoral-granting public university in the southeast of the United States, Grimes and Charters (2000) found that female students, African-American students, and on-campus students spent more time per week in the library than did their male, Caucasian-American, and off-campus counterparts.
The level of anxiety represents one of the best indicators of the library experiences of college students ( Onwuegbuzie, Jiao, &amp; Bostick, 2004 ). Indeed, in her seminal study of 6000 college students, Mellon (1986) , who first coined the term  X  X  X ibrary anxiety, X  X  found that 75 X 85% of undergraduate students described their initial library experiences in terms of anxiety. Specifically, library anxiety is a situation-specific dispo-sition, characterized by an uncomfortable feeling or emotional state with physiological and behavioral con-comitants, which occurs in library settings ( Mellon, 1986, 1988; Onwuegbuzie, 1997 ). As noted by Mellon (1986) , feelings of library anxiety arise from either the relative size of the library; insufficient knowledge about the location of materials, equipment, and resources of the library; lack of knowledge of how to ini-tiate library research; or lack of knowledge of how to proceed with a library search. Library-anxious stu-dents tend to experience negative emotions such as ruminations, fear, apprehension, and mental disorganization, which impede their abilities to use the library effectively ( Jiao, Onwuegbuzie, &amp; Lichten-stein, 1996 ). Moreover, library anxiety can have debilitating effects on students  X  academic achievement ( Onwuegbuzie, 1997; Onwuegbuzie &amp; Jiao, 2004; Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004 ).

Because of the debilitative nature of library anxiety, several researchers have investigated antecedents of this construct (for a comprehensive review, see Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004 ). Yet, to date, only one study has examined the role of race in the formation of library anxiety. Specifically, in an attempt to determine whether the reported racial differences in the academic library experiences between African-American and
Caucasian-American students also led to their experiencing different levels of library anxiety while using the library, Jiao, Onwuegbuzie, and Bostick (2004) compared the five subscale scores and total scale scores of the Library Anxiety Scale ( Bostick, 1992 ; cf. Section 2.2) between African-American graduate students attending a Carnegie-designated research-extensive university and Caucasian-American graduate students attending a Carnegie-designated doctoral-granting institution. Their findings indicated that Cau-casian-American graduate students reported significantly higher levels of library anxiety associated with three of the five subscales of the Library Anxiety Scale ( Bostick, 1992 ) than did the African-American graduate students. Their findings suggest that race appears to be a predictor of library anxiety levels.
However, because the two racial groups of students selected for the study differed with regard to the types of institution they attended, the researchers were unable to conclude whether the differences found in the library anxiety levels were the result of race or the groups  X  educational experience/aptitude. There-fore, the purpose of the present study was to replicate Jiao, Onwuegbuzie, and Bostick  X  s earlier investi-gation by controlling for the participants  X  educational and institutional background in order to determine if race predicts levels of library anxiety among graduate students. In the current investigation, the two racial groups of graduate students were all selected from the same institution in which all students had to attain a minimum level of academic performance (e.g., grade point average [gpa]; Graduate Re-cord Examination [GRE] scores) as undergraduate students in order to be admitted to the graduate pro-grams at this Carnegie-designated doctoral-granting university located in the southeast of the United
States. 2. Method 2.1. Participants
Participants were 180 graduate students enrolled in the College of Education at a university in the south-east of the United States, comprising 155 Caucasian-American and 25 African-American graduate students from various disciplines (e.g., secondary education, psychology, speech pathology). All participants were solicited while enrolled in a research methodology course. In order to participate in the study, students were required to sign an informed consent document that was given during the first class session of the semester.
For participating in the study, students received three percentage points that formed part of their final course grade averages. No student declined to participate. For both the Caucasian-American (85.81%) and African-American (84.00%) samples, the majority of the participants was female. (The proportion of female students was typical of the proportion of females who enrolled in graduate programs in the Col-lege of Education at that institution.) Ages of the participants ranged from 23 to 60 years ( M = 32.00, SD = 9.04) for the Caucasian-American sample and from 23 to 55 years ( M = 36.08, SD = 8.28) for the
African-American sample. Also, the mean grade point average of the participants was 3.69 (SD = 0.36) for the Caucasian-American sample and 3.50 (SD = 0.43) for the African-American sample. 2.2. Instruments and procedure
Participants were administered the Library Anxiety Scale (LAS), which was developed by Bostick (1992) . This measure contains forty-three 5-point Likert-format items (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree; 5 = Strongly Agree) that assess levels of library anxiety experienced by users.
The LA Scontains the following five subscales or dimensions: (a) barriers with staff (e.g.,  X  X  X he librarians are unapproachable X  X ); (b) affective barriers (e.g.,  X  X  X  get confused trying to find my way around the li-brary X  X ); (c) comfort with the library (e.g.,  X  X  X  feel comfortable in the library X  X ); (d) knowledge of the library (e.g.,  X  X  X  enjoy learning new things about the library X  X ); (e) mechanical barriers (e.g.,  X  X  X he copy machines are usually out of order X  X ). A high score on any subscale represents high levels of anxiety in that area. Jiao and
Onwuegbuzie (1997) reported score reliability, as measured by coefficient alpha, for each subscale as fol-lows: .90 (barriers with staff), .80 (affective barriers), .66 (comfort with the library), .62 (knowledge of the library), and .60 (mechanical barriers). For the current investigation, the subscales generated scores for the combined sample that had a classical theory alpha reliability coefficient of .94 (95% confidence inter-val [CI] = .93, .95) for barriers with staff, .90 (95% CI = .88, .92) for affective barriers, .71 (95% CI = .64, .77) for comfort with the library, .62 (95% CI = .52, .70) for knowledge of the library, and .62 (95%
CI = .51, .71) for mechanical barriers. Using Nunnally and Bernstein  X  s (1994) criteria, these score reliability coefficients were in the adequate to high range. 3. Results
According to Onwuegbuzie and Daniel (2002) , variables for which either the standardized skewness coef-ficient (i.e., skewness coefficient divided by its standard error) or the standardized kurtosis coefficient (i.e., kurtosis coefficient divided by its standard error), or both, are outside the  X 3 range suggest departures from normality. An examination of the standardized skewness and standardized kurtosis coefficients pertaining to all five library anxiety dimension scores (i.e., dependent variables) indicated no serious deviation from normality. Specifically, for the Caucasian-American participants, all five standardized skewness coefficients were within the  X 3 range: barriers with staff (2.49); affective barriers (1.32); comfort with the library ( 0.15); knowledge of the library (1.98); and mechanical barriers (0.81). With respect to the standardized kurtosis coefficient, with the exception of barriers with staff (7.72), all other dimensions were within the nor-mality range: affective barriers (0.33); comfort with the library (0.99); knowledge of the library (0.76); and mechanical barriers (0.36). For the African-American participants, all five standardized skewness coeffi-cients were well within the  X 3 range: barriers with staff ( 0.20); affective barriers ( 0.37); comfort with the library ( 0.96); knowledge of the library ( 1.00); and mechanical barriers (0.39). With respect to the standardized kurtosis coefficient, again, all five dimensions were within the normality range: barriers with staff (0.48); affective barriers (0.02); comfort with the library (0.26); knowledge of the library (0.55); and mechanical barriers ( 0.19).

The fact that 9 out of the 10 standardized skewness and kurtosis coefficients were within the bounds of normality justified the use of parametric independent samples t -tests to compare the Caucasian-American and African-American sample members with respect to the five dimensions of library anxiety. The Bonfer-roni adjustment was applied to take into account the fact that five pairwise comparisons were made (i.e., one for each library anxiety dimension), such that the total experimentwise error rate did not exceed 5%.
This correction was undertaken by dividing the nominal alpha value by 5 (i.e., .05/5 = .01). Therefore, the adjusted level of significance was .01.

Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations corresponding to scores on all five subscales as a function of race. After applying the Bonferroni adjustment, the series of independent samples t -tests re-vealed no statistically significant differences between the Caucasian-American and African-American sam-ples with respect to the five dimensions. Specifically, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups with regard to levels of library anxiety associated with barriers with staff, affective barriers, comfort with the library, knowledge of the library, and mechanical barriers.
 As recommended by researchers (e.g., Cohen, 1969; Dayton, Schafer, &amp; Rogers, 1973; Fagley, 1985;
Fagley &amp; McKinney, 1983; Onwuegbuzie &amp; Leech, 2004; Sawyer &amp; Ball, 1981; Woolley &amp; Dawson, 1983 ), whenever statistically non-significant findings emerge, researchers should assess the statistical power of the tests involved. That is, researchers should conduct post-hoc power tests for statistically significant findings. Statistical power can be viewed as how likely it is that the researcher will find a relationship or difference that really exists ( Cohen, 1988; Onwuegbuzie &amp; Leech, 2004 ). Post-hoc power analyses involve using information about the sample size, the observed effect sizes, and the level of significance to determine the probability of correctly detecting a difference or relationship. Unfortunately, in the present study, appli-cation of the Bonferroni adjustment reduced the statistical power of each of the independent samples t -tests. At the 5% level of significance, the statistical power for detecting a moderate effect (i.e., d = .50) was .75, which is close to the desired power level of .80 ( Cohen, 1988 ). However, at the Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance used in the present study, namely, 1%, the statistical power for detecting a moderate effect, dropped considerably X  X o .49!
In order to counter this lack of statistical power affecting the independent samples t -tests, Onwuegbuzie and Levin  X  s (in press) three-step procedure was utilized. According to these researchers, when two or more comparisons are made, the direction of each difference can be examined for trend. Interestingly, in the pres-ent study, the direction of the difference was the same for all five library anxiety dimensions. Specifically, for all five anxiety dimensions, the Caucasian-American participants reported higher levels than did the Afri-can-American sample members. In order to test whether this trend was statistically significant, Onwuegbu-zie and Levin  X  s (in press) test of aggregate z -scores was employed. Specifically, for each of the five anxiety measures, raw scores were converted to z -scores such that each participant had five z -scores. These five z -scores were then summed for each participant to yield an aggregate z -score. Finally, an independent samples t -test was conducted to compare the aggregate z -scores between the Caucasian-American and Afri-can-American students. This test revealed that the African-American students ( M = 1.01, SD = 7.74) had statistically significantly ( t = 1.67, p &lt; .01) lower z -scores than did the Caucasian-American students ( M = 0.16, SD = 3.94). The effect size, as measured by Cohen  X  s (1988) d , was .31, suggesting a small-to-moderate effect. Thus, the test of aggregate z -scores revealed that the consistency with which the
African-American graduate students had lower levels of library anxiety than did the Caucasian-American students was both statistically and practically significant. 4. Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to replicate the study of Jiao et al. (2004) , who examined racial differences in library anxiety. These authors found that African-American graduate students attending a
Carnegie-designated research-extensive university reported statistically significantly lower levels of library anxiety associated with barriers with staff, affective barriers, and comfort with the library, than did their
Caucasian-American counterparts attending a Carnegie-designated doctoral-granting institution. Unfortu-nately, the two racial groups that were compared differed with respect to the types of institution they at-tended. As such, the researchers were not able to declare definitively that the differences found in library anxiety levels were largely the result of race. These anxiety differentials could have been the result of the groups  X  differences in educational experience/aptitude.

Therefore, the present study attempted to control for educational background and institutional back-ground by selecting Caucasian-American and African-American graduate students from the same institu-tion in which all students had to attain a minimum level of academic performance as undergraduate students in order to be admitted to the graduate programs. A series of independent sample t -tests revealed that none of the five library anxiety dimensions statistically significantly discriminated the two racial groups. However, as a result of applying the Bonferroni adjustment, the statistical power pertaining to these five comparisons was severely reduced. Thus, as recommended by Onwuegbuzie and Levin (in press) , a three-step method was used to examine the direction of the five pairwise differences. This procedure re-vealed that (a) in all five cases, the African-American sample had lower levels of library anxiety than did their Caucasian-American counterparts; (b) the consistency with which the African-American graduate stu-dents reported lower levels of library anxiety across all five dimensions than did their Caucasian-American counterparts was statistically significant; and (c) this consistency across all five dimensions of library anx-iety was also practically significant, suggesting a small-to-moderate effect.

Onwuegbuzie and Levin  X  s (in press) three-step procedure suggests strongly that the African-American students reported consistently lower levels of library anxiety than did the Caucasian-American students.
As such, this finding supports that of Jiao et al. (2004) . By comparing two racial groups of students from the same institution, the present study helps to reduce the threat to internal validity of the findings that might arise from differential selection of participants, as was the case in Jiao et al.  X  s (2004) study ( Gay &amp;
Airasian, 2003; Onwuegbuzie, 2003 ). Therefore, the current finding provides incremental validity to the inference that (a) race is an environmental antecedent of library anxiety among graduate students; and (b) library anxiety has a racial context. These two sets of findings also are consistent with that of Ralston,
Ambler, and Scudder (1991) , who reported that African-American college students taking public speaking classes at predominately White universities tended to have lower levels of communication anxiety than did their Caucasian-American counterparts.

Conversely, both the finding of the present study and that from Jiao et al.  X  s (2004) research contradict those from the myriad of studies in which African-American students have been found to report higher lev-els of academic-related anxieties than have their Caucasian-American counterparts (e.g., Coney &amp; West, 1979; Onwuegbuzie, 1999; Payne, 1984 ). Even if the three-step method had not been conducted, and, instead, all interpretations had been based only on the series of independent samples t -tests, the resultant conclusions would still have contradicted the bulk of the anxiety literature in which racial comparisons have been made. 5. Conclusion and further research
Nevertheless, more research is needed to determine why African-Americans in both studies reported sig-nificantly lower levels of library anxiety, or at least why they did not report higher levels of library anxiety than their Caucasian-American counterparts, bearing in mind that African-American graduate students typically report higher levels of statistics anxiety ( Onwuegbuzie, 1999 ) and attain lower levels of achieve-ment in research methodology courses ( Onwuegbuzie, 1998 ) than do their Caucasian-American graduate students. Qualitative techniques clearly have an important role to play here. Such research could include interviews (e.g., unstructured, semi-structured), focus groups, and observational methods. Other qualitative research methods could be employed such as structured interviews. Moreover, mixed methods studies should be designed in which both quantitative and qualitative data are collected within the same study or series of studies. (For a comprehensive discussion of mixed methods studies in the context of library and information science research, see Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004 .) Such mixed methods studies could emerge from an attempt to address one or more of the following five purposes of mixed methods research outlined by Greene, Caracelli, and Graham (1989) : (a) triangulation (i.e., seeking convergence and corroboration of findings from different methods that study the same phenomenon); (b) complementarity (i.e., seeking elab-oration, illustration, enhancement, and clarification of the findings from one method with results from the other method); (c) development (i.e., using the findings from one method to help inform the other method); (d) initiation (i.e., discovering paradoxes and contradictions that lead to a re-framing of the research ques-tion); (e) expansion (i.e., seeking to expand the breadth and range of inquiry by using different methods for different inquiry components).

According to Onwuegbuzie et al. (2004) , gender appears to be an environmental antecedent of library anxiety, with males reporting higher levels of library anxiety in some studies (i.e., Jacobson, 1991; Jiao &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 1997; Jiao et al., 1996 ) and females reporting the highest levels of library anxiety in other studies (i.e., Mizrachi, 2000; Shoham &amp; Mizrachi, 2001 ). Thus, because the participants in both the present study and Jiao et al.  X  s (2004) study were predominantly female, replications are needed using a larger sam-ple of males so that the possibility of a race  X  gender interaction could be explored. Further, by including undergraduate and graduate students within the same inquiry, the three-way interaction among race, gen-der, and year of study also could be investigated. In addition, as recommended by Jiao et al. (2004) , library anxiety among other racial and ethnic groups should be examined.

Should future studies confirm that African-American college students report relatively lower levels of library anxiety, then the next step for researchers would be to determine how this favorable differential might translate into higher overall levels of academic performance among African-American college stu-dents since lower levels of library anxiety have been found to be associated with higher levels of academic achievement ( Onwuegbuzie, 1997; Onwuegbuzie &amp; Jiao, 2004; Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004 ). As such, libraries should have an even more important role to play in helping to reduce the current racial gap in academic performance among college students.
