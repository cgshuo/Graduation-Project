 1. Introduction
In January 2004, over 50 million people in the USA published content to the Web, including photo-graphs, messages, and files of various kinds and approximately 5 million people maintained a website ( Len-hart, Horrigan, &amp; Fallows, 2004 ). While this survey-based research did not examine the motivations, objectives and tasks surrounding this publication activity, we can assume that a significant number of peo-ple, perhaps millions of people, invested time in creating outbound links to websites. We can consider the work associated with selecting links, writing titles and descriptions, arranging the items on Web pages, and maintaining the integrity of the links a form of bibliographic work. Given the ancient history of bibliogra-phyanditsimportanceinlibrarystudiesandliteraryscholarship( Francis,1973 ; Stokes, 2003 ),thisposition is admittedly idealistic. Nevertheless, we shall argue that making this conceptual move X  X hat is, analyzing the production and organization of information in terms of the standards of bibliography X  X eads to pro-ductive ways for examining popular classes of information artifacts and for conceptualizing improved tools for the collection, and organization of electronic resources.

Websites, of course, serve different purposes and audiences and therefore present selective material and experiential opportunities. Thus, we can expect that the process of selecting, describing, and organizing links to electronic resources will vary depending on the genre of the website. The term genre is used by
Web designers to characterize classes of websites that share critical features, such as personal e-commerce, daily news, community conference and so on ( Crowston &amp; Williams, 1997 ; Van Duyne, Landay, &amp; Hong, 2003 ; Yates &amp; Orlikowski, 1992 ). With experience, readers are assumed to readily identify the genre of a website and orient their expectations concerning the nature of the material, information-seeking ap-proaches, and options for interaction. When the genre of a website is difficult to detect, it can be disorient-ing to the reader. At the same time, the genre places constraints on the form and topic of the communication and the nature of the audience. Such constraints simplify the work of the website devel-oper. For developers with experience in bibliography or collection development, these constraints might be carefully articulated in policies and procedures. More typically, however, the constraints of the genre, while being important for readers and readily observable through signals of various kinds, are implicit and not written down in policies. Thus, for example, a teenager  X  s personal Web log of daily happenings, known as a blog ( Blood, 2000, 2004 ), is likely to be readily distinguished from an elementary school tea-cher  X  s list of homework links suitable to a 5th grade class. While the visual design and editorial style are salient signals of a genre so too is the nature and form of the outbound links. In short, the elementary school teacher will employ selection criteria and structuring and formatting standards that support his or her pedagogical objectives. Students might be asked to visit some links in a particular order whereas other links will be optional; at the same time, link descriptions and cited sources will be coordinated with the curriculum. The blogger, onthe other hand, has adifferent audience in mind and different intentions for including outbound links in her entries. Nevertheless, in some important senses these are both bibliogra-phies because pointers to resources are collected, collocated, and arranged. Indeed, the early blogs of circa 1998 were bibliography-like, rather than personal commentaries, with the twist that they focused on fast breaking news and newly available information ( Blood, 2000 ). Still, today among the many journal-like blogs are blogs that predominantly contain lists of links with pithy descriptions that act as instruments for information discovery ( Bar-IIan, 2004 ; Schiano, Nardi, Gumbrecht, &amp; Swartz, 2004 ).

A common website genre, referred to as resource page in this article, draws significant benefit from bib-liographic practices. We define a resource page as a website that contains an organized set of outbound links on a given topic. (Of course, a resource page might consist of multiple pages and frequently a resource page isone elementof awebsite with abroader purpose.) Librariansmight use the term directory to refer to this concept. The etymology of the term is unclear but may have been coined in distinction to home page , which typically contains personal information, by the early users of the Web who needed a genre to capture material concerned with projects or topics. A Google exact-match search for Resource Page restricted to page titles turns up approximately 39000 evidently distinct sites (search performed 1 July 2004). In general, the status assigned to resource pages by information professionals is often low because professional prac-tices for their creation and maintenance are often not followed.

As a genre, resource pages are centrally concerned with the description and organization of links. Labels that may indicate other neighboring and overlapping genres include hotlist, portal, gateway, directory, webliography, WebQuest, and so on. The categories denoted by these labels are certainly fuzzy and in flux, and we know of no systematic attempt to clearly define these terms, although the importance of formal def-initions of systems that make up this space has been noted ( Goncalves, Fox, Watson, &amp; Kipp, 2004 ; Smith, 2004 ). A further definitional difficulty is that many websites that serve largely bibliographic purposes draw upon other collaborative and interactive features such as message boards, blogs, chat rooms, and so on.
Resource pages are often developed by knowledgeable, and sometimes fanatic, individuals who gather and organize material concerned with a common subject. Like a bibliography, a resource page enables peo-ple to readily discover items relevantto their informationneeds bycollocatingselective materials onagiven subject area. A prototypic example is the Human X  X omputer Interaction Bibliography ( Perlman, 2004 ).
This project, lead by Gary Perlman since its inception in 1988, organizes various resources, including printed and online-only materials, of the field into such categories as companies, consultants, education, online columns by usability experts, and so on. In addition, approximately 28500 entries, mostly citations to academic papers, were added to the bibliography by a grassroots effort outside of the publishing indus-try.Volunteers have helpedsustainthebibliographysince1988 bysubmittingandverifying items( Perlman, 1999 ). While the advent of the ACM Digital Library ( ACM, 2004 ) has rendered the bibliography of pub-lished papers somewhat obsolete, it nevertheless collocates materials, especially from non-ACM journals and third party resources, in very useful presentations.

As a case study, the HCI Bibliography can be used to illustrate four general claims about the evolution of resource pages. First, resource pages are often started by a single person, the director, who has an inter-est in a subject area but is typically not trained in bibliographic work. Second, the director of the resource page may recruit help in making the collection grow and thus he or she may organize a community of con-tributors around the development of the resource page. Third, in general, to maintain a high degree of rel-evance the resource page must evolve, and this is especially the case for subject areas that are themselves evolving rapidly. Forth, in addition to supporting information finding, a resource page can support the development of communities of interest, enabling groups to socialize and collaborate. At this general level of description, the development of resource pages appears to be relatively straightforward. We shall see, however, that this is not the case.

The purpose of this article is to examine the conceptual and technical issues associated with developing sustainable bibliographies of electronic resources by non-specialists. It will be argued that this is an impor-tant area of inquiry because many non-professionals, working alone and in small groups, are creating bib-liographies yet we know little about nature of these artifacts and the practices used to develop and sustain them. Further, this appears to be a long-term phenomenon which the Web enables. In the next section, we establish the background for this inquiry, beginning with a discussion of professional bibliographic prac-tice, examining the case that bibliography-like publishing is extremely common on the Web, and reviewing the literature on electronic collection development, which, in general, is critical of the efforts of non-profes-sionals. In Section 3, we propose a framework for organizing the full range of online bibliographic efforts and sample several key positions in this space. This analysis is then abstracted into a conceptual model that extends the traditional conceptualization of bibliography to include the notion of participatory develop-ment. In Section 4, we then use this model to reflect upon our own efforts to develop a resource page. This case study allows us to factor out the technical issues associated with the creation, maintenance, and pub-lishing of bibliographies from lasting conceptual issues which, in turn, are more readily identified and fully understood. The article concludes with a discussion of the design challenges associated with the develop-ment of tools that support the participatory development of bibliographies.
 2. Background 2.1. Professional bibliographic practices
Francis (1973) introduces the practice of bibliography thus:  X  X  X he tasks of the compiler of a bibliography are (1) to find what books on a particular subject exist; (2) to describe them item by item; and (3) to assem-ble the resulting entries into useful arrangements for reference and study X  X  (p. 978). This deceptively simple procedure reveals a remarkable degree of conceptual universality. By replacing the word book with scroll or
Web page we can see that bibliography applies equally well in the age of Alexandria and in the age of the dot.com, and by clarifying the notion of reference and study we can, in principle, address any information need and context. Further, it is a procedure that is accessible to anyone with a basic level of literacy and some familiarity with writing and publishing tools. The only essential prerequisite is the motivation to col-lectandlist.Yet,clearly,thisprocedurealonedoesnotguaranteethequality,ormorespecificallythefitness of purpose, usefulness, or versatility of the resulting bibliography on a particular subject. To meet these quality criteria, a great deal of judgment is required.

Drawing on the theoretic work of Wilson (1968) , Bates (1976) clarifies this judgment for the professional librarian. She defines a bibliography as  X  X  X  list or sequence of descriptions of graphic materials on a given subject or area. X  X  (p. 9) and proceeds to present, in splendid detail, a decision-making process that leads to rigorous systematic bibliography . The central claim of this process is that the specifications for creating a bibliography, and similar information artifacts such as directories, must be made explicit and rigorously followed during its creation. As represented in Fig. 1 , this process is decomposed into six types of specifi-cation. According to Bates, the task of the bibliographer is to make explicit decisions concerned with each type of specification and to state these decisions and their rationale to the readers of the bibliography.
When this is done, readers are able to understand the purpose and coverage of the bibliography and this contextual information informs readers for how they should employ it for information discovery.
Likedocumentsingeneral,bibliographieshavealogicalandphysicalstructure( Andre,Furuta,&amp;Quint, 1989 ). The logical structure consists of the explicitly modeled entities, attributes, and relationships that for-mally specify the bibliography for computational representation and manipulation whereas the physical structureconcernsthepresentationofthebibliography,thatis,itsappearance. Bates(1976) doesnotclearly identify this distinction and, indeed, for her audience of information professionals in the mid 70s, develop-ing bibliographies for print, it is irrelevant. Perhaps reflecting this period, Bates uses the terms  X  X  X ist or sequence X  X  to characterize the arrangement of bibliographic items but, of course, other arrangements might be useful; for example, a node-link graph of items indicating intellectual borrowing, such as the beautifully rendered chart of influence relationships amongst popular styles of music and album sales between 1955 and 1974 ( Tufte, 1997, p. 90 ). This observation, however, is not new. Bradshaw, a seminal figure in descrip-tive bibliography, wrote in 1870:  X  X  X he books are arranged strictly according to their respective countries, towns and presses; and, the year of the earliest dated production of each country, town or press, being af-fixed, it is hoped that the arrangement will at once afford its own explanation X  X  ( Stokes, 2003, p. 283 ). Thus, different arrangements reveal differentinformationbecausetheycollocateitemsindifferent ways,theclassic arrangements being alphabetical by author or chronological by publication date.

In general, people can happily ignore the distinction while nevertheless benefiting from it. On the other hand,computationally,itiscrucialbecausethelogicalstructureofabibliography,orbibliography-likearti-fact, constrains the range of physical arrangements that canbe presented. Indeed, this is fundamental in the fieldofinformationvisualization( Card,Mackinlay,&amp;Shneiderman,1999 ),whichfocusesontechniquesfor creatingdynamicdisplaysthatsupportspecifictasks.Toillustratethepotentialpayoffofexaminingthelogical structureoffamiliarinformationartifactsforbibliography-likeforms,consideralistservwhereamoderator sendsoutweeklymessagesconcerningsomewelldefinedtopic.Often,thesemessageswillcontainlinkstorele-vantresources.Withinanarchiveofsuchmessagesliesakindofbibliographythatisnoteasilyrecognizedas suchbecausethelinksareintermixedwithinotherwrittenmaterial.Yet,bycollectingthelinkstogetherinone place and by describing and formatting the items in a consistent fashion this otherwise latent structure sur-faces. In turn, through a single list of links, the archive of messages is potentially made more valuable.
Returning to the model, Bates (1976) paints a picture of a lone compiler working diligently, even pains-takingly, to select items to be presented in the relatively fixed form of print. She does not address the pos-sibility of sustaining bibliographies over time by, for example, outlining specification types that cover such matters as collecting and responding to implicit and explicit audience feedback, controlling the evolution of the bibliography  X  s scope, highlighting recent selections and de-selections, and so on. Yet, such matters can be very important. Certainly, this is the case when specifications of scope are provisional or contentious, when the number of potential items is large and the relative value of an item can change quickly as a func-tion of time, or when items are subject to change and authoritative sources for their discovery do not exist.
Settings where such constraints apply are common. Examples include bibliographies intended to support the formation of a new field (e.g., Ubiquitous Computing), to support decision-making in design and devel-opmentcontexts,or tosupportreflection or discussiononaprovisionalbody ofmaterials. Characteristicof these settings is fluidity.

Broadeningthepicturetoaninstitutionallevel,approachesforsustainingcollectionscanbereadilyiden-tified in collection development policies (e.g., Evans, 2000 ; Mack, 2003 ; Orr, 2003 ). Fundamentally, these policies set out management plans for how an institution will engage its patron community. These plans cover such matters as how the institution will budget for and prioritize the collection of materials, how items are suggested, selected and de-selected and by whom, how disagreements about selections will be re-solved, andso on. Itmustalso beacknowledged, however,that creating andmaintaining acollection devel-opment policy is exceedingly difficult, even for elite institutions (e.g., see Spohrer, 2003 ).
When a resource page is published and attracts an audience, it becomes a dynamic social artifact. People visit it and might want to discuss it and contribute to it. Interestingly, resource pages simultaneously draw on the properties of bibliographies and collection development policies. We shall see that this is the key to understanding a wide range of bibliography-like artifacts that are found online. 2.2. Descriptions and critiques of online collections
For librarians, the Internet has thrown up pressingchallenges for the collection and organization of doc-uments, especially third party electronic resources ( Levy &amp; Marshall, 1995 ; Pitschmann, 2001 ; Torok, 2003 ;
Wells, Calcari, &amp; Koplow, 1999 ). Janes et al. (1999, chap. 2) outline the issues and offer practice-oriented solutions for implementing electronic collections. For electronic resources, they give specific guidance on such matters as documenting selection policies, cataloging items, developing access points, implementing a working system with Web infrastructure, and sustaining the collection over time. Taking a conceptual stance, Lee (2000) discusses how technological advances, especially the infrastructure that enables digital libraries, have disrupted traditional notions of collections, including tangibility of resources, clarity of own-ership, and uniformity of user community. In short, when so much is available through a commercial search engine, why collect? In Lee  X  s view, disintermediation, that is, people using technology to discover resources rather than relying on humans or human-crafted artifacts presents a major challenge to online collections. Lee frames the controversy with two competing points of view, where the technological-opti-mistic view is held by one side. Under this view, it is predicted that in the future all information will be reachabledigitallyandthat,withtoolsforsearchandorganizinginformation,peoplewillbeabletodirectly access information that they need. Simply stated, information technology will become more powerful and usable, enabling end-users to work directly with primary sources.On the other side isthe professional-prac-tice view. Here, the position is that significant value, that is, more effective access to information for time expended, can be added by creating selective, highly focused collections. Simply stated, human expertise in information seeking, selection, and description add sufficient value to make intermediation viable.
A middle ground, not discussed, is that of non-professionals creating useful, broadly used collections, perhaps with the assistance of professionals. Borgman (2001) argues, and we agree, that current trends run contrary to the general predictions of disintermediation X  X ibrarians and information professionals are assuming critical roles in the development of digital libraries, in organizing resources, and assisting peo-ple in finding information. Yet, as discussed below, non-professionals seem to be playing interesting inter-mediation roles as well.
 Reviews of online collections typically begin by asserting quality criteria for collections. Robinson and
Bawden (1999) and Bawden and Robinson (2002) , for example, drawing on common collection develop-ment standards (e.g., Evans, 2000 ), propose that Internet subject gateways should: (1) clearly describe the subject scope; (2) explicitly document the criteria for selecting resources; (3) describe or annotate all resources; (4) categorize or index all resources; and (5) clearly define the roles and responsibilities of people involved in the creation and maintenance of the collection. Then, the collections are reviewed against these criteria. In their review of academically oriented gateways, these writers found considerable variation in the degree that these criteria are met. Franco (2003) and Wells et al. (1999) give similar reviews.
When such criteria are used to evaluate resource pages prepared by non-professionals they, perhaps not surprisingly, are found to be inadequate. Kirriemuir (1999) , for example, in a similar survey of gateways says  X  X  X t is somewhat worrying that a ridiculously large number of people, organizations and other entities are still creating lists of links to resources, often with little or no quality criteria, standards for describing resources, or thought that they might be duplicating better work done elsewhere X  X  (section, Excluded re-source discovery systems). Yet, at the same time, Bawden and Robinson (2002) regrettably state:  X  X  X qual-ity-controlled subject gateways] remain an under-used, under-valued, and, in large part, unknown resource, for Internet users ... It remains an important task for information specialists to promote the value of these resources X  X  (p. 161). 2.3. Bibliographic work by non-professionals
Little appears to be known about how non-professionals create bibliographies. In fact, we know of no studies that have investigated discretionary practices of  X  X  X mateur bibliographers X  X , people, without profes-sional training, who compile lists of resources. A great number of resource pages have been published; yet, we seem to know littleabout who creates them, why are they created, what practices are followed, who uses them and for what purpose? While much literature relates to this activity, including personal information management (e.g., Jones, 2004 ), information architecture (e.g., Garrett, 2002 ; Rosenfeld &amp; Morville, 2002 ), and website design (e.g., Van Duyne et al., 2003 ), research has not addressed resource pages as a specific genre. This omission in the literature is puzzling. Perhaps, a major reason for it is simply due to the fact that lists, resource pages, and other bibliographies created by amateurs do not meet the normative stan-dards of professionals.

Nevertheless, bibliography-like work appears to be a very common activity. Several sources of evidence back this claim. First, anecdotally when one visits personal home pages, pages created by community orga-nizations, and so on, one invariably encounters lists of links under headings such as  X  X  X elated links X  X ,  X  X  X y favorites X  X ,  X  X  X ee also X  X , and so on. At commercial sites, such as amazon.com, users are prompted to submit lists of favorite books or favorite sites and descriptions in order to create interesting material (i.e., a bib-liography) that attracts other customers. Finally, inspecting the archives of a newsgroup over an appropri-ate period of time will turn up scores of submitted links to potentially relevant resources. At a first level of approximation, these various lists of links are similar to the abstraction of trails, proposed by Vannevar
Bush. Indeed, perhaps he anticipated much of this bibliographic activity when he said:  X  X  X here [will be] a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record X  X  ( Bush, 1945, Section 8, para. 3 ). The key observation is that many users create lists of descriptive pointers that adhere to some scope whether described or not.
Second, structural analyses of the Web, which have sought to identify cohesive citation structures with graph-algorithmic techniques, have found a fair degree of structure ( Kleinberg &amp; Lawrence, 2001 ). In fact, using data from 1998, Kumar, Raghavan, Rajagopalan, and Tomkins (1999) , discovered approximately a hundred thousand cohesive communities as defined by a high degree of inter-site citation compared to intra-site citation. Random inspection of a small sample of these  X  X  X ommunities X  X  found that the cohesive-ness of the linking structure was due to citation patterns around very narrow topics, such as resources on  X  X  X il spills off the coast of Japan X  X  ( Kumar et al., 1999, p. 403 ). Of course, popular search engines such as
Google exploit this  X  X  X atent X  X  structure to improve the precision of search results (e.g., Google  X  s PageRank algorithm, Brin &amp; Page, 1998 ). And, in the future, the dynamic analysis of the structure of the scientific literature, especially in connection with message groups, blogs, download requests, and other online activ-ities, will become more important for identifying important trends and assessing the impact of research ( Henzinger &amp; Lawrence, 2004 ; Kleinberg, 2004 ). An obvious point is that this macro structure emerges as people create localized micro-structures through the selection, description, and arrangement of links X  X ibliographic work is clearly important here!
A final sign is the frequency of use of the term bibliography and related terms (see Table 1 ). Informal samples of the resulting hits shows a wide range of bibliography-like information artifacts, which often ap-pear to be created by non-professionals. Irrespective of the general quality of these lists of resources, they areimportantbecausethey locallystructuretheWeband,inturn, enablethediscoveryofresourcesboth by machines and by individuals.

In sum, the Web has enabled a class of amateur bibliographers to arise; yet, their products have not re-ceived systematic investigation. This observation is striking in light of the research being directed towards blogging (e.g., Bar-IIan, 2004; Blood, 2004; Lindahl &amp; Blount, 2003; Schiano et al., 2004 ). In the next sec-tion, we propose a framework for organizing the space of collection development efforts and review a sam-ple of projects. 3. Online bibliographic projects
Fig. 2 presents a framework for comparing collections where projects are plotted by the number of peo-ple who select resources versus the number of resources available. Because of its generality, we can chart a diverse range of projects and systematically sample projects. The figure shows four major regions: (1) the area where a relatively large number of people create large collections, (2) the area where individual people create collections of sizes which span five orders of magnitude, (3) the area where a large number of people create collections of small to moderate size, and (4) the area where a moderate number of people create collections of moderate size. Using this framework, we can examine, at least to a course grain, how labor is organized and tools employed to create collections of various sizes.

This section consists of two parts. In the first part we sample selected projects from this framework in a purposive fashion; that is, we identify examples that illustrate different points in the framework. This sam-pling is neither exhaustive nor systematic except to the extent that we aim to identify a reasonable spread of systems. Then, for these examples we discuss basic issues concerning the organization of intellectual effort, thetypesoftoolsandstructuresused,andgeneralconformancetotraditionalbibliographicpractices.Next, in the second section, we propose a conceptual model that accounts for the participatory nature of many of the projects. Further, we showhow this new modelexpands thetraditional view of bibliography inaninter-esting way.

The estimates of the number of selectors and the number of resources are taken from statements con-tained in the site, for example, on the front page, About section or Help section. To improve the readability of this presentation, in general, only the front page for the site project is referenced in Table 2 and not spe-cific pages. These estimates were first made January 2004 and verified in July 2004. Finally, capital letters, beginning with A, are used to reference particular sites below, in Fig. 2 ,andin Table 2 . 3.1. Examples
Yahoo Groups (A) enable people to create Web-based environments for information management and for collaborating in small groups. Once registered, anyone can create a group that can be made open to the public or restricted to a list of members. Groups contain a variety of information management tools, including a bookmark tool for organizing links to third party resources, a photo-album for updating and organizing pictures, a directory for uploading and organizing files, and a database application for the definition and management of times that can be represented with records and fields (e.g., list of recipes, class assignments, etc.). In addition, chat, message boards, and a group calendar are available for enabling socialization and collaborative work. Approximately, two million groups, all sharing the Yahoo look-and-feel, have been created and are organized into a directory, evidently by Yahoo  X  s editors. Assuming that 10 X  100 resources are collected within each club gives an impressive estimate of the total number of resources collected. Yahoo Groups, in short, illustrates what can happen when localized selectors and centralized integrators collaborate. Of course, this does not mean that items are easily found. LiveJournal (B), a com-munity of blogs, is of similar scale albeit blogs have few provisions for collecting resources, and more gen-erally, information management.

The Open Directory Project (C), at dmoz.org, aims to be the definitive catalog of Web resources by recruiting volunteers to organize electronic resources and to freely distribute the resulting catalog. Follow-ing the open source model, people apply to be an editor for a topic and volunteer their time to select, orga-nize, and describe resources. Typically, editors begin by collecting links for small categories and as they develop seniority they can gain responsibility for larger and more general categories. In turn, senior editors review the work of more junior editors; thus, editors are organized into a hierarchy much as the categories themselves. Users of the directory are encouraged to submit links which are reviewed for inclusion by edi-tors. Approximately, 63000 editors manage four million links in over a half million categories; thus, this project can be seen as an effort to organize a large number of bibliographers, with all the associated prob-lems of maintaining a rigorous selection process. The Yahoo Directory, of course, is of a similar scale but it does not publish the size of the directory nor promote the editors that sustain and grow it.

Infomine (D), a digital library of electronic resources suitable to academic users, is led and run by librar-ians. The aim of this project is to create a very high-quality collection of indexed resources by following traditional practices in librarianship, complemented by automatic and semi-automatic tools for discover-ing,describing, andclassifying items.Of the approximately 100000resources,25000resources were created by librarians and the remainder by automatic means.

The Librarians  X  Index to the Internet (E), which began in the early 1990s, aims to provide well-organized access to high-quality Internet resources. This collection of materials is created by librarians, following a rigorous process of selection, description, and cataloging. Detailed selection criteria and style guides are published at the site. The site accepts recommendations from the public but only a select group of approxi-mately 100 contributors can submit records which are then reviewed and verified by an even smaller group of editors. Unlike Infomine, the use of computational tools to augment manual practices is minimal.
Approximately, 14000 resources are available. The Internet Public Library ( Janes et al., 1999 ) follows a similar approach. Franco (2003) and Wells et al. (1999) give reviews of additional portals created by librarians.

The Wikipedia (F) aims to develop a comprehensive, multi-lingual encyclopedia of human knowledge where each article meets very high standards of scholarship. This project follows the Open Source model where anyone is able to contribute or revise an article, defined as a piece of text of 200 characters or longer.
A version control system tracks the revision history and enables revisions to be rolled back. This mecha-nism and other collaborative tools have enabled the full multi-lingual encyclopedia to grow rapidly in three years to approximately 659000 articles written by 17000 contributors. (The English version has approxi-mately 261000 articles written by approximately 7000 contributors.) It is claimed that many of the articles are of poor quality and the pressing goal in its development is to improve the quality of the articles.
The Virtual Library (G), claimed to be the oldest catalog of the Web, was developed through a loose federation of volunteers where a single editor manages the top-level categories and a second tier of editors manage the topic pages. It aims to create a catalog of academic-oriented resources, particularly in science and engineering. To contribute, an editor develops a list of links on a particular topic and asks to be in-cluded in the top-level categories. In contrast to the Librarians Index to the Internet and Open Directory
Project, the Virtual Library does not publish selection criteria, record formatting guidelines or style guide-lines and nodefactostandardhas emerged; thus, each topic page has different record formats foritems and visual styles. To indicate that a page is part of the virtual library, editors use a standard logo and URL that points to the top-levelof the virtual library. Thisup-linkis theonly available mechanismfor structuring the catalog. The Virtual Library is structured with approximately 15 main categories which organize approxi-mately 500 topics and an estimated 50000 links (assuming 100 links per topic). While difficult to confirm, it appears that this collection is no longer growing and may be a fossil.

The USGenWeb Project (H), which aims to create a catalog of genealogy resources, follows a similar model where a single national coordinator is responsible for the national page, which lists pages for each of the states. In turn, state coordinators are responsible for managing the list of links to county pages. Fi-nally, at the bottom of the directory, county coordinators are responsible for collecting and presenting the genealogy information resources for each county. The project has published bylaws and a mediation pro-cess for resolving conflicts amongst coordinators but does not publish detailed guidelines on selection cri-teria, record format, or visual style. Like the Virtual Library, lower levels of the catalog employ up-links to structure the information resources at the county level.

About.com (I) recruits and carefully selects guides , people who collect and organize resources and write original material for specific topics. A consistent information structure and visual presentation is enforced by About.com, which claims that it has approximately one million resources, 50000 topics, and 500 guides.
Topics contain a significant amount of advertising and guides are remunerated based, in part, on the num-ber of page views that their topics generate. It attracts approximately 40 million unique visitors per month which puts it among the top 10 most popular websites.

So far, the examples come from region #1 of Fig. 2 where institutional and loosely collaborative orga-nizations marshal labor for the purpose of building relatively large collections. Yet, most bibliographies that are published on the Web appear to be largely single-person efforts. The Human X  X omputer Interac-tion Bibliography (J), introduced earlier, is one example. Cyndi  X  s List (K), a resource page for genealogy research resources, is another and is noteworthy because of its combination of scale and simplicity of tech-nical infrastructure. This site, which began in 1996 as a bookmark file of 1000 links, has grown to over 250000 categorized links and is maintained by a single person, using very simple writing and publishing tools.The compiler writes: X  X  X  have created each andeverypage onmy site byhand.I write the HTMLcode myself and use Word for Windows to do so X  X . ( Howells, 2004 ). It is a remarkable example of what a highly motivatedpersoncanaccomplishwith themost rudimentaryoftools butitisalsoexceptional X  X eknowof no similar examples.

For a single person, order 10 5 number of items is very large. More typically, bibliographies that are cre-ated, or at least controlled, by an individual editor seem to range in size from order 10 to 10 the distribution of the sizes of bibliographies is important problem, outside the scope of this analysis. This is not an easy problem because of the sheer size and diffuseness of the Web but also because even the def-inition of a Web page is controversial (e.g., see Henzinger &amp; Lawrence, 2004 ). In any case, the nature of these resources pages varies to a very large degree. If in doubt of this, perform a Web search on Biblio-graphy or Directory , restricted to the title of a page and then sample the results. To dodge this problem, one can investigate the nature of bibliographies that are all generated from a common application. One such application Links Engine ( Gossamer Threads, 2004 ), a server-side code library that enables editors to create, manage, and organize items in a collection environment and to then publish these items at a web-site. Examples of resource pages that range in size from order 10 such as  X  X  X inks Engine X  X . At increasing size the following sites are typical: Champion Fishing Links Direc-tory (L), Encyclopedia of Psychology (M), and Esoterism.com Search Engine (N). In each case, the re-source page consists of a relatively small number of categories and subcategories with resources listed.
Readers can submit new resource descriptions which, in turn, are reviewed by an editor for acceptance and readers can submit general comments to the editor. In addition, readers can rate the quality of items and the click-through traffic each item receives is tallied and reported to the editor. Thus, the editor is given feedback from the reading audience on the quality of the resources. The application also provides a dy-namic list of newly added items, an alerting service, and the ability to sample randomly selected items, an idea that was suggested by Bates (1976) . Many other resource pages, whether handcrafted or created from proprietary tools, have similar features. The Ubiquitous Computing Resource Page (O) is one exam-ple that is discussed below.

Turning to region #3, resource pages that contain a few links but are created by a large number of peo-ple, we see only a few examples, which particularly stretch the meaning of resource page. Nevertheless, this region presents interesting opportunities for identifying the most popular or highest quality material be-cause it plots systems where the behaviors or opinions of many people are aggregated. This region is par-ticularly suited to identifying new trends. One approach in this vein, followed by the Lycos Fifty (P) and
Google Zeitgeist (Q), is to analyze the search queries of millions of users and identify the queries that are growing most rapidly. The top queries are listed to allow users also to search on these topics. Another ap-proach is to analyze the linking structures (i.e., who is citing who) of dynamic, online conversations and uncover the topics being discussed. Technorati (R), for example, computes lists of the top blogs, books, and news articles by analyzing, in near real-time, the text and linking structures of over three million blogs.
A final example is Slashdot (S), where a select group of editors accepts news items that are submitted by a broad, technically oriented audience and where the quality of those news items can be rated by the audi-ence. Systems for peer review and social book-marking ( Hammond, Hannay, Lund, &amp; Scott, 2005 ) are other examples that generally fall within region #4 where a moderate number of people create moderate sized collections.

In sum, this framework charts the terrain of collection development efforts in terms of the number of selectors and size of the collection and shows three significant regions. While far from exhaustive, this sur-vey reveals a tremendous diversity of tools and practices that shape the development of collections. Next, we ask: Is it possible to identify general dimensions that underlie these systems? 3.2. Conceptual model
Focusing on region #1 and #2, we extend Bates  X  (1976) model by identifying and labeling the collabo-rative aspects employed by these projects when selecting items. In this way, we begin to identify the general dimensions and better see the regularities across the full spectrum of information systems. In turn, this con-ceptual model provides an effective ground for exploring system requirements and analyzing existing tools.
First, we need to introduce the notion of participatory practices in relation to the selection of biblio-graphic items and suggest the types of collaborative policies that are available to the compiler. To begin, consider this scenario:
Top-TenProblemScenario . AresearcherinUbiquitousComputingwishestocreateabibliographyofthe10 central papers on this field. Together, the papers should map the field and enable researchers in neighboring fields to recognize the applicability of their specialties.

Todevelop asolution to this problem, several different kindsof approaches are available for establishing a participatory selection policy. First, the researcher could review her own information sources, select 10 items, and publish them. Then, based on feedback elicited from the audience, she could revise the list. Sec-ond, the researcher could select a sample of 30 sources and ask a small group of trusted colleagues to rate the items. Based on the ratings and, perhaps additional unsolicited items, she could make a final selection.
Third, she could ask her colleagues to submit their top-ten picks and make a final selection from this mate-rial. As a final example, the researcher could post a general call to a large list of researchers in the field, asking for the best papers and make the final selection from the items submitted. Each of these approaches represents a different kind of participatory policy for selecting items but, even for this trivial scenario, it is far from obvious which policy will result in the most effective, high-quality top-ten list for effort expended.
In all likelihood, the researcher will select the most expedient approach and this will likely be largely deter-mined by the available technical resources (e.g., access to e-mail, listserv, etc.).

Now, we can seek a more abstract view. Following Bates (1976) , the aim of the conceptual model is to explicate the ideal process for selecting items in a technologically neutral fashion. Here, however, the focus is onhow the bibliographer can augment the specification types associated with individual items witha par-ticipatory process. To do this, the original model, shown in Fig. 1 , is extended to model the life-cycle of a bibliographic item in Fig. 3 . This move associates a life-cycle status with each item, thereby explicating how items pass through a series of stages, from item-proposed to item-de-selected. By observing changes in item status, stakeholders can take the appropriate actions to move an item through its life-cycle. This approach falls under the class of event-based workflow systems, where one designs a workflow by specifying a series of allowable events, actions and responsibilities ( Anderson, Anderson, Wadhwaini, &amp; Bartolo, 2003 ).
In a strict manifestation of the workflow, this life-cycle is a waterfall where the process forces items to pass through a series of states with no backtracking. In practice, of course, backtracking is often needed to respond to oversights and changes in judgment; furthermore, an item  X  s state might be conditioned on other criteria (e.g., the availability of the item has been shown to be reliable). A more important point concerns the subset of states that an item can pass through and the ordering of states. Should it be possible, for example, to accept an item before it is described? What happens if any proposed item is accepted? How are the judgments of multiple selectors coordinated for a final decision? By reasoning from the abstractions in Fig. 3 , we can examine these questions and explore the consequences of difference design choices at some level of detail. We can, furthermore, discuss the similarities and differences of the above projects in terms of the choices made in how items pass through each stage of a life-cycle. Thus, by examining the workflow associated with items, the regularities of the above projects can become apparent.

For example, the Librarians  X  Index to the Internet ensures quality by imposing a rigorous workflow for how items pass through the phases of proposed, described, verified and selected. Further, the workflow is relatively centralized. With the Open Directory Project, the workflow is simplified and the responsibilities for selection are distributed. In both cases, automatic tools might be used to periodically check the avail-ability of the resource, compute an access-reliability metric, and highlight items that fall below a threshold.
In addition, if someone disagrees with an editor  X  s selection, a note can be sent to the responsible editor, asking that the item be removed. For the Open Directory Project, this is crucial because, with audience feedback, the relatively lax selection criteria can be balanced by the ability to send corrective feedback to the editor. This allows the number of items to scale better than, for example, the Librarians  X  Index to the Internet at the cost of maintaining consistency in selection criteria. With the Wikipedia, a completely open policy is followed. For this to work, a motivated pool of knowledgeable writers and a version control system is required so that changes can be tracked and rolled back. In sum, we can identify a major trade-off for ensuring quality: A centralized, multi-stage process for selecting items followed by a relatively high level of stability versus a distributed, relatively simple initial process for selecting items followed by the ability to take corrective actions. In the first case, the workflow leads to an incrementally fixed collection; in the sec-ond, it leads to a forever provisional collection.

Additional options are possible with this conceptual model. Some workflows, for example, will proceed in parallel with multiple editors making judgments that are hidden from each other. After the rating phase, these judgments and rationale might be made visible for a period of debate or kept confidential. In other cases it might be desirable to make all deliberations visible in real time. Another option concerns the pro-visionality of some state transitions. In some workflow scenarios, state transitions will occur subject to some conditions where, for example, an item might be accepted subject to a revised description or accepted items might remain accepted subject to the reliability of the resource and a yearly check of the resource  X  s content. Another kind of option concerns the visibility of items as they move through the phases. Should, for example, proposed or rejected items be made publicly available? Making proposed items available, al-lows the audience to give the selectors some initial feedback. Showing rejected items can clarify the scope, or other selection criteria, of the bibliography but, in some cases, might cause unwanted consequences for the authors of the item. This analysis of the space of collaborative practices in bibliography shows that at least the following decisions need to be made to create a collaborative policy for creating and sustaining bibliographies: What are the (1) the allowable item states; (2) the allowable transitions between item states; (3) the conditions necessary for transitioning between states; and (4) the authorities and responsibilities en-tailed by the conditions.

A variety of operations can be applied against a particular workflow. In terms of human-oriented oper-ations, selectors and readers might want to inspect , rate ,or commenton a resource, and check various prop-erties, includingcitations,historyof editorial changesmade tothe item, click-throughtraffic receivedbythe item, and so on. The audience might be prompted to submitnewitems or subscribetosyndicatedupdates of newly added resources. Readers, furthermore, might benefit from a scoped search in which just the sites in the bibliography are searched and where search results are presented in the context of the bibliography.
More complex activities include the participatory development of schemes for structuring the bibliography, revisingstructures,andhighlightingalternativeorcontentionsstructuresandenablingdiscussionandnego-tiation. For machine-oriented operations, selectors might expect automatic checking for duplicates, link reliability, readability, accessibility, and other such properties. Or, the structure and content of the biblio-graphy might be used to drive automatic or semi-automatic resource discovery ( Hendry, in press ). The true power of these otherwiseordinaryoperations comes from how they functionin aninterrelated waywithin a particular workflow.

Overall, this analysis reveals a profound challenge. To enable various forms of participation in the cre-ation of a bibliography, the bibliographer must first design the policy, just as with the selection criteria, but selecting among the available collaboration policies and implementing a policy is exceedingly difficult. In-deed, in general to implement a policy requires a Web development project which, in turn, transforms the bibliographic project into a complex systems building effort. In short, the tools available for implementing collaborativebibliographic policies lagourabilitiestoinventpolicies.Inthenextsectionwediscusssomeof these implementation challenges. 4. Case study: Ubiquitous computing resource page
Inthissection,acasestudyispresented.Theaimofthiscaseistodescribethecollaborativechallengesof creating bibliographies in a particular technology milieu and thereby specifically illustrate the conceptual issues of the previous section. This case comes from our own development efforts and summarizes a 10 month project to design and implement a resource page on Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp). Ubicomp is a quickly evolving, multi-disciplinary field of research that explores computing technology as it moves be-yond the desktop environment and becomes increasingly interwoven into the fabrics of our lives. The increasing power and decreasing size and cost of a variety of technologies enables computers to be carried, handheld, worn, or embedded in things, places and even people. The field of ubiquitous computing is con-cerned with the design, implementation and deployment of these technologies, as well as the impact these technologies have on people and society. The central idea for the Ubicomp Resource Page was to support researchers by collecting and organizing selected items that focused on the people , projects , and organiza-tions of the field ( McCarthy, Jenkins, &amp; Hendry, 2003 ).

The project consisted of two key members: A developer with a background in technical project manage-ment who was just completing his master  X  s degree in Library and Information Science (the second author) and an expert in ubiquitous computing (the third author). The project was originally scheduled to run for six months but was extended and ran for nine months at approximately 20 h/week for the developer. Four goals drove the project: (a) gather together the key resources on Ubicomp for the purpose of supporting researchers in the field and neighboring fields; (b) present these items in a consistent, integrated fashion to promote directed and serendipitous exploration of the field; (c) position the resource page in such a waythatitcomplementsregularlyconvened conferencesonUbicomp;and,mostchallenging ofall;(d)cod-ify selection policies such that the growth of the collection would be sustainable.

The project was divided into two phases. For phase I, collection development, the aim was to assemble a collectionofresourcesofsufficientsizetoattractmembersoftheUbiquitousComputingcommunityandto describe these resources in a consistent scheme. To structure this work, it was decided that the collection would focus on people , projects , and organizations . Using search engines and a variety of secondary access points,provisionalitemswereselected.Theaccesspointsincluded alistofhomepagesforresearchersinthe field, bibliographies found at project sites, and the proceedings from the Ubicomp conferences, workshops, and journals items were selected. To organize this process, an application for managing bookmarks,
PowerMarks ( PowerMarks, 2004 ), was used. This application provided convenient methods for describing resources, tagging them with keywords, and saving entries. As sites were visited and determined to be rel-evant, the URL of the site was captured along with title, description, and institution metadata. Images, if found, were also saved. Then, the site  X  s other outbound links were inspected and additional pages were added if appropriate. In this way, PowerMarks was used to organize the process of collecting resources and developing a general awareness of the size, scope, and relationships within the Ubicomp community.
Asthislistgrew,regularmeetingswereheldtoreviewtheappropriatenessandqualityoftheitemsandto clarify the subject scope of the collection. These review meetings were crucial for establishing a shared vi-sion for the subject scope and quality criteria for the items to be included in the collection. This was par-ticularly important because the boundaries of the field have yet to be established and appear to be controversial (e.g., ubiquitous computing is not yet in the ACM Computing Classification System). Inci-dentally, while statements on subject scope and quality criteria were not written, they were reviewed and rehearsed frequently in project meetings.

As items were collected, the team explored how items falling under the categories of people , projects and organizations could be interrelated. Initially, one goal was to explicitly model the many-to-many relation-ships amongst these items, thus allowing readers, for example, to access a Ubicomp researcher and then discover the projects that the researcher has participated in and the organizations that the researcher be-longs to. It was felt that explicitly modeling these connections would be a valuable for enabling readers to readily explore the Ubicomp research community. Furthermore, interesting possibilities for visualization could be pursued. Two problems, however, soon became apparent. First, clearly defining the meaning of the categories project and organization proved to be problematic. For example, projects span from small, single person efforts to multi-institutional, government-funded initiatives. Even more difficult, however, was deciding what conditions needed to be met for a person to be considered a participant on a project or for a project to be within an organization . The team discovered various categories of relationship includ-ing people who were affiliated with but not members of an organization, people with joint appointments, people who had been members of different organizations at different times, and people who played major roles on Ubicomp projects but where not themselves researchers in Ubicomp. In short, deciding when to associate a person with a project or organization became a political act and initial feedback from our col-leaguesmadeclearthatourjudgmentswerenotalwaysseentobeobjective,despiteourbestefforts.Second, a database schema that would represent these many-to-many relationships was a complex design and de-velop task, outside the scope of the project. Thus, even if the conceptual problems associated with defining these classes and making reliable judgments could be solved, maintaining these relationships manually over time would be very time-consuming. Thus, for conceptual and technical reasons, the team decided to aban-don the idea of explicitly modeling the many-to-many relationships between people , projects , and organizations .

At this point, it was decided that the site would emphasis these three categories. The people items consist of the fields name , affiliation , home page , photo ,and publications . A list of publications is generated by a query to the ACM Digital Library ( ACM, 2004 ) and the DBLP Bibliography Server ( DBLP Bibliography
Server, 2004 ).We felt that photographs of theresearchers wouldmake the collection more interesting anda list of photographs of many Ubicomp researchers was available.

Turning to project items, they consist of the fields name , project homepage , photo , and brief description , which is typically copied from text found on the home page or publication of the project. An important observation was the remarkable diversity of description and presentation of projects, organizations, and peopleatparticularsites,andamajorcontributionoftheprojectwastostandardizethedescriptionofthese items. As discussed above, the team decided to not associate people and organizations with projects . The photo field was added in response to the observation that many of the projects included photographs illus-tratingthesystemand,liketheimagesoftheresearchers,thesephotographsmadealonglistofentriesmore interesting to scan.

Finally, turning to organization items, they consist of the fields name and homepage . Organizations rep-resentanothercategorythathasvaryinglevelsofgranularity(aswithprojectsandinitiatives).Forexample, academicresearchersareassociatedwiththeiruniversity,theirschool,their department,andanynumberof centers, groups or labs. Again, for conceptual and technical reasons, distinctions and connections among these different kinds of organizations were not modeled. In addition to these major components, the re-source page also presents event and news items lists. (These lists are described further.)
The next consideration was how to arrange the items in each of these lists. The team estimated that for the first version, there could be as many as 200 items in each of the lists and that this number could grow to 500 items and perhaps more, especially for the project list. Thus, the team felt it was important to introduce some method of categorization. The team, however, decided to defer this issue and decided on an alpha-betic ordering by name of person, project, and organization, clearly a suboptimal arrangement for people who are uncertain of what they are searching for. The reasons were twofold. First, informed by the early discussionson the subject scopeforthe field, the team knewthat creatingthematic categorieswouldbevery difficult and sufficient time would not be available to gather feedback on the quality of the categorization scheme. Second, the task of developing a categorization scheme was in competition for time to create tools that would enable members of the Ubicomp community to submit and discuss items. This second task was given priority and the team decided, if time permitted, to revisit the categorization problem later.
After approximately three months, the team transitioned into phase II, community development. The original project brief called for a static collection of resources, accepting that sustaining the collection would be the job of a single person working alone. As the project evolved, however, a shift in thinking oc-curred. It began with an observation and a simple future scenario.

The observation was that it was very challenging to decide what items were within the subject scope of the collection and what were clearly outside. In weekly discussions, we attempted to find prototypic examples of items that were clearly in and out of scope and we attempted to find boundary cases that re-vealed potential controversies. The team soon found itself wanting to elicit outside opinions. In turn, this led to the future scenario: Members of the Ubicomp community might want to discuss the resources and help shape the collection. If this were so, could the resource page explicitly support discussion and, second-arily, could the ability to register, submit items, and review items enable the collection to be sustained? The project was extended and the team began to explore options for creating a relatively open-ended, collabo-rative environment for collection development.

The initial technical platform for development was a set of XML files and associated style sheets. This was thought to be a straightforward and sufficient approach, consistent with the technical skills of the team and the original project brief. However, with the expansion of the brief to include collaborative features, a new technological platform was needed. The team decided to experiment with Plone ( Plone, 2004 ), an open source development kit for building complex, collaboration-based Web applications. Among the many claimed benefits of Plone were a robust set of community features, a membership model, and a content management framework. After several weeks of effort, the team ran into significant technical problems. First, we discovered that to customize Plone, programming skills in Python and ZClasses were required.
These skills, however, fell outside the core competencies of both the project team and the greater commu-nity involved with the project. Second, while the community features had much potential, they required users to register and log-in even to read discussions. Loosening this authentication model, however, ap-peared to be quite difficult. Finally, the Ubicomp Resource Page was being developed for a Microsoft Win-dows environment. Configuration and extensions to Plone, however, seemed to privilege open source tools and this added a significant level of complexity.

For these technical reasons, the team switched to the ASP.NET Community/Portal Starter Kit ( Micro-soft, 2004 ). The starter kit provided many of the same features of the Plone framework, including content management workflow, message boards, RSS feeds, and so on with a much more usable administration console and simpler methods for customizing the application. Because it would be impossible to monitor and manage abuse (e.g., unprofessional or unrelated comments on professional work), the team decided to not implement discussion boards. In short, for largely technical reasons, unrelated to the conceptual problems of bibliography, the Community/Portal Starter Kit was selected.

Reflecting on the project, the following key lessons have been learned. First, with the publication of a collection of electronic resources comes the opportunity, perhaps even expectation, to enable community participation in the collection. Making this move adds a significant degree of technical complexity to the project. But, it also throws up tricky social-cum-political questions such as how should a newly developed collection fit into existing sites that support the Ubicomp community. Second, the conceptual issues asso-ciated with defining the scope of the resource page, the structure of the bibliographic items, and the meth-ods of categorization were truly daunting. Yet, so too were the technical issues associated with simply creating and publishing the collection. Regrettably, the technical aspects of this project dominated because the team was unable to find tools that were suitable for developing resource pages and that were commen-surate the technical competency of team and scope of the project. Third, the conditions that enable a re-source page to be sustained are poorly understood. Early in the project the team acknowledged the tendency of resource pages to quickly become fossilized and wanted to avoid this situation. Indeed, the
Intelligent Environments Resource Page, http://research.microsoft.com/ierp/ , was the best resource avail-able in the field in 2003 but it reflected a snapshot of research circa 1998. This project sought to avoid this fate. Yet, it soon became apparent that the effort required to do this was beyond the scope of this small project. These lessons prompted us to reflect more broadly on electronic collections and led us to this ana-lysis of collaborative bibliography.

How common are the experiences of this case study? While we do not have data that allows us to gen-eralize, it is important to address this question. From an institutional standpoint, it is clear that managing electronic resources is a difficult problem and that many professional organizations have experienced significant challenges. Pitschmann (2001) reviews the issues confronted by institutional libraries but he does not consider the participatory forces of networked information that lead to audience expectations for engagement and collaboration. Reasoning that, in general, professionals are better equipped to manage the development of collections, we can expect to see that non-professionals also experience significant chal-lenges. Anectodally, this appears to be the case.

In one example is from our own consulting experience concerns an organization that maintains a collec-tion of electronic resources on a complex, interdisciplinary topic. The aim of the collection is to support a diverse audience, interested in this topic in terms of education, research, and social activism. The collection has been subdivided into four major themes and a different person is responsible for periodically weeding and adding resources to each theme. Technically, the collection consists of four HTML pages that are hand edited to simple standards and the size of collection is approximately 200 links.

For this project, one can see both the importance of traditional bibliographic practices but also the need to address collaborative policies that enable the resource collection to be sus-tained. Collaborative policies concerning the relationship between the selectors and collection  X  s items (i.e., how the selectors work together) and between the audience and the collection (i.e., how the audience uses the collection) are clearly important in this project. Yet, like the Ubicomp project, this team lacks the tools and resources to develop policies that address these two aspects of sustaining a collection over time. 5. Conclusion
This article has examined bibliography from a new perspective, introducing the possibility of collabora-tion, extending the traditional conceptual view of bibliography to include collaborative practices that en-able people to participate in creating, shaping, and sustaining collections. We believe that collaborative policies for bibliography are fundamentally conceptual just as are the traditional criteria of subject scope, selection rules, and bibliographic units. Facilitating participatory decision-making, shaping workflow and making it visible, and enabling audience discussion of bibliographies are enduring, long-term goals. The difficulty, however, is that such conceptual challenges are not easily separated from particular implemen-tation issues. We do not have enough experience with such systems and much work remains to be done to document and to analyze the design space of bibliography-like applications. In the present state of the art, implementing a collaborative policy requires a significant investment in systems development. In turn, this barrier restricts the exploration and adaptation of different collaborative practices to groups with significant technical resources.
 A variety of research topics emerge from this work:
Amateur bibliographers . A large number of bibliographies and bibliography-like information artifacts are created by non-professionals. On Web logs, on home pages, and on resource pages millions of people arecreatinglistsofresources.Whiletheselistsoftenfallshortofthestandardsofprofessionalbibliography, they are nevertheless important organizing instruments which, in turn, lead to a great benefit. The various forms of amateur bibliography are, in general, underappreciated and understudied. This is surprising given the evident popularity of list-making in all its various forms and its importance in search-engine algorithms such as Page Rank ( Brin &amp; Page, 1998 ).
Bibliography construction tools . Tools that are designed for single, non-professional users and ad hoc groupsofpeoplearelacking.Fortheseusers,thecommonpracticeistodevelopbibliographies withgeneral writing and publishing tools. Even for users with access to technical resources, a great deal of enabling infrastructure must be built. And, as discussed in Section 4, implementing this infrastructure has the poten-tial to deflect attention away from important conceptual issues such as the selection and arrangement of items. In principle, publishing a resource page should be no more difficult than publishing a personal Web log, which in its most basic form is a 5 min process on such sites as www.blogger.com .

Professional intermediation . With many amateurs employing tools to create bibliographies, interesting opportunities exists for professionals to help people in the creation of bibliographies, complementing the intermediation of information-seeking problems. We envision professionals asking questions about collec-tion development policies, selection criteria, and so on. In short, online bibliography presents librarians with a new area for service-oriented, professional practice.

Collection development and bibliography . Collection develop policies primarily concern how an institu-tion will manage its holdings through the delegation of resources and responsibilities. Bibliography is pri-marily concerned with developing instruments that allow effective information seeking. In general, the bibliography-like artifacts reviewed in this article show that practices are borrowed, deliberately or not, from both of these areas. Because of the dynamic nature of the Web, resource pages can tend to been seen as, and sometime are, institutions, run by communities of interest. It is important to better understand the factors that motivate volunteers to collect resources and how these factors can be supported in policies.
Further analysis of the connection between collection development and bibliographic practices may clarify how resource pages can be designed for sustainability.
 Finally, we believe that bibliographies and bibliography-like artifacts will play major roles in the future.
Fundamentally, bibliographies locally structure the Web into a patchy network of organized areas. These microstructures are invaluable for prompting communication around common topics, for enabling auto-matic and semi-automatic resource discovery, and for providing creative outlets. They signal the impor-tance of intermediation. As McArthur (1986) as argued with historic examples, the taxonomic urge runs deep. It is an urge, however, that we have yet to fully understand and support in the current technological milieu. Much remains to be learned about the collaborative possibilities of bibliographies.
