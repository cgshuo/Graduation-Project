 Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are no longer just a problem for high-income countries, but they are also a prob-lem that affects developing countries. Preventive medicine is de nitely the key to combat NCDs; however, the cost of pre-ventive programs is a critical issue affecting the populariza-tion of these medicine programs in developing countries. In this study, we investigate predictive modeling for providing a low-cost preventive medicine program. In our two-year-long eld study in Bangladesh, we collected the health checkup results of 15 ; 075 subjects, the data of 6 ; 607 prescriptions, and the follow-up examination results of 2 ; 109 subjects. We address three prediction problems, namely subject risk pre-diction , drug recommendation , and future risk prediction , by using machine learning techniques; our multiple-classi er approach successfully reduced the costs of health checkups, a multi-task learning method provided accurate recommen-dation for speci c types of drugs, and an active learning method achieved an efficient assignment of healthcare work-ers for the follow-up care of subjects.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as heart dis-ease, stroke, cancer, chronic kidney diseases, and diabetes mellitus, have been increasingly prevalent worldwide. The World Health Organization reported that NCDs accounted for 63% (36 million) of the 57 million global deaths in 2008 and approximately 80% of all NCD-related deaths occurred in low-and middle-income countries [1]. In such coun-tries, 29% of NCD-related deaths occurred in the working-age group (in people aged &lt; 60 years), which is remarkably higher than that in high-income countries (13%), and con-tributes to declining labor productivity. The total number of annual NCD-related deaths is estimated to reach 55 million by 2030 [9].
 Preventive medicine is undoubtedly the key to combat NCDs. Preventive medicine consists of three levels: primary prevention to maintain healthy conditions, secondary pre-vention to avoid the development of NCDs, and tertiary pre-vention to avoid disease progression to serious stages. Over time, the focus of medical services in developed countries has c hanged from acute and serious diseases to the management of NCDs.

There are two critical issues facing developing countries with respect to the popularization of preventive medicine programs: the cost of preventive medicine and the shortage of healthcare workers. For example, disposables for physical examinations including urine, blood sugar, and hemoglobin tests cost approximately USD 2-3. This price is not afford-able in most low-income nations where the average monthly income per household is less than USD 100. In addition, the lack of a healthcare workforce is a severe problem. For instance, there are only 0 : 36 physicians per thousand popu-lation in Bangladesh, one of the developing countries, while the physician density is 2 : 45 in the United States [8]. We have developed an eHealth system named Portable Health Clinic (PHC); it is an efficient and easy-to-operate preventive medicine service using information and commu-nication technology [6]. PHC is composed of three steps, namely health checkup, tele-consultation and prescription, and follow-up care. These three steps correspond to the three levels of a preventive medicine program. Figures 1 and 2 show an overview of PHC. PHC includes portable packages for health checkups equipped with a tablet com-puter and consumable goods for physical examination. The tablet computer is connected to a mobile network to send the checkup results to a data server at the medical center. PHC offers tele-consultation and prescription services with a doctor at the medical center to a subject who is suspected to have a health problem. Follow-up checkups are also sched-uled using portable checkup packages. Our two-year-long PHC eld study in Bangladesh resulted in a collection of health checkup results of 15 ; 075 subjects, 6 ; 607 prescrip-tions offered by doctors, and follow-up examination results of 2 ; 109 subjects.

Although PHC has been established as a bene cial pre-ventive medicine program, there is still room for improve-ment to make it a cost-efficient system. In this study, we apply predictive approaches to the collected data and inves-tigate the usage of machine learning methods for providing a low-cost preventive medicine program. We address the following three prediction problems: subject risk prediction , drug recommendation , and future risk prediction . The health checkup procedure in PHC includes low-cost tests, such as measurement of weight or body temperature, that do not re-quire disposables, and high-cost tests, such as urine or blood sugar tests, that use consumable goods for the measure-ments. The high-cost tests make the preventive medicine program expensive, and if we can reduce the number of ad-ministrations of high-cost tests, the preventive medicine pro-gram becomes more affordable for developing countries.
The present study rst addresses the problem of predict-ing the subjects' health risks by using the results of low-cost tests and proposes a strategy to select subjects who really need the high-cost tests. We next tackle the drug recommen-dation problem. If we can predict the drugs that each sub-ject should have, we can reduce the workload of the doctors and allocate the limited human resources more efficiently. In addition, if we provide an accurate recommendation on the basis of the results of low-cost tests, we can reduce the cost of high-cost tests. Finally, we focus on supporting the follow-up process. The aim of this process is to take care of the subjects who still have a health problem. Our goal is to predict the future risk levels by using the previous checkup results to provide priorities on staff assignments to high-risk subjects.

We formalize these problems and investigate the practi-cability of predictive approaches with respect to a low-cost preventive medicine program. Our key contributions are summarized as follows: We provided eHealth checkups for the population in Bangladesh for two years. We collected the results of ques-tionnaires and health checkups of 15 ; 705 subjects and 6 ; 607 prescriptions for 2 ; 461 subjects. Among all the subjects, 2 ; 109 underwent the checkups in both the rst and the sec-ond year. In the rst year, we conducted the study around Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The sites covered in the second year were Chittagong (south-eastern area), Rajshahi (western area), Thakurgaon (north-western area), and cer-tain areas around Dhaka. We developed an eHealth system named Portable Health Clinic (PHC). PHC consists of a set of devices in a suitcase, a data transmission system linked to a mobile network, and a data management application. The suitcase is equipped with a tablet and consumable goods for urine, blood sugar, and hemoglobin tests. We also prepared a tele-consultation and tele-prescription service using Skype over a mobile net-work to gather health data. The checkup and tele-medical procedure is shown in Figure 2. Subjects were rst asked to complete a questionnaire, and then, they underwent the health checkup. The checkup results were stored in a tablet and sent to the main server at the medical center in Dhaka. Using the result, we categorized each subject into one of the following four risk groups: Healthy , Caution , Affected , and Emergency . For the subjects in the Affected or Emer-gency group, we provided a tele-consultation with a doctor at the medical center. If required, the doctors sent tele-prescriptions. Subjects who received a tele-prescription were expected to visit their local pharmacies to purchase the pre-scribed medicines.

The questionnaire contained 33 questions about basic in-formation, health condition, disease history, and lifestyle. Fi gure 2: Procedure for our PHC service. When subjects visit the checkup booth, they are asked to ll out a questionnaire (Step 1), and then, they go through a physical examination (Step 2). If a sub-ject is identi ed as Affected or Emergency (Step 3), a tele-consultation service with a doctor at the tele-medicine center is offered (Step 4). One year later, we provide a follow-up examination for the subjects. Seven out of the 33 questions were about drug allergies and surgical history, and the subjects who took a tele-consultation were asked to answer these questions mandato-rily. All the questions except age were given in a multiple-choice format.

We collected the results of checkup items including hip size , height , weight , and those shown in Table 1. Only 2 ; 627 subjects underwent the hemoglobin test. We collected the result of either the blood sugar (fasting) or the blood sugar (postprandial) test of each subject. The costs of urine, blood sugar, and hemoglobin tests were much higher than those of the other tests because these three tests needed a consum-able good for each measurement. The consumables cost per measurement is shown in Table 1.
 In order to assess a subject's risk level, we established Bangladesh logic [6]. This criterion helped assign one of the four risk levels ( Healthy , Caution , Affected , and Emergency ) to each of the 13 checkup items shown in Table 1.
The overall risk level of a subject was determined by the maximum risk level among all the checkup items. For in-stance, even if a subject was assigned with Healthy in 12 items and Emergency in one item, the overall risk level of this subject was determined to be Emergency . We also cate-gorized the subjects whose overall risk level was Affected or Emergency as high risk , and the others were categorized as low risk .

In the tele-consultation, the doctors selected multiple medicines from 49 drugs and prepared a prescription if re-quired. The medicines were categorized by their purposes, such as drugs for hypertension or drugs for cough and cold . Table 1: List of consumables cost per measurement
Our dataset consisted of 8 ; 476 (54 : 0%) male subjects and 7 ; 229 (46 : 0%) female subjects. The subjects' ages ranged from 18 to 106 years, and the average age was 35 : 6 years. There were 3 ; 857 (24 : 6%) subjects from ur-ban areas, 4 ; 815 (30 : 7%) subjects from suburban areas, and 7 ; 033 (44 : 8%) subjects from rural areas. The num-ber of subjects who took the rst checkup in the rst year was 7 ; 495 (47 : 7%) and that of subjects who underwent the checkup in the second year was 8 ; 210 (52 : 3%). We categorized 2 ; 136 (12 : 5%), 8 ; 483 (53 : 7%), 4 ; 632 (30 : 5%), and 454 (3 : 3%) subjects as Healthy , Caution , Affected , and Emergency in terms of the overall risk level, respectively.
The average number of suggested drugs per subject was 2 : 7 among the subjects who obtained the prescriptions, and the number of suggested drugs ranged from 1 to 10. The average number of prescriptions per drug was 134 : 8. The minimum number of prescriptions per drug was 1, and the maximum was 1 ; 322.

Among the subjects who took the checkup in both the rst and the second year, 326 (15 : 5%), 1 ; 144 (54 : 2%), 585 (27 : 7%), and 54 (2 : 6%) subjects were categorized as Healthy , Caution , Affected , and Emergency in terms of the overall risk level in the rst year, respectively. There were 585 (27 : 7%) subjects whose risk level improved and 632 (30 : 0%) subjects got worse in the second year.
In the following experiments, we processed the results of health checkups and converted them into feature vectors as follows: We encoded the categorical information into fea-ture vectors by using the one-of-K encoding. Categorical information included the results of urine tests and arrhyth-mia, the risk level of each checkup item, and the response of each question in the questionnaire except age. Continuous values, such as age or the result of physical examination, were scaled to t the range of 0-1. The transformation was learned on the training data and applied to the rest.
Because not all the subjects underwent the blood sugar (fasting), blood sugar (postprandial), and hemoglobin tests, sometimes, we did not have these values in the training data and hence, failed to scale these parameters by using the mi nimum and the maximum values. Thus, we prede ned the ranges for these values on the basis of the Bangladesh logic. That is, we de ned the ranges as [100 ; 200] for blood sugar (fasting), [140 ; 300] for blood sugar (postprandial), and [8 ; 12] for hemoglobin. If the outcome of one of these items was within the de ned range, the risk level was Cau-tion or Affected . After the scaling, the missing values were input as 0 : 5.
We rst address the problem of predicting subject risks and discovering low-risk subjects from the outcomes of the questionnaire and low-cost tests. The aim of this prediction is to cut the health checkup costs for the low-risk subjects. Note that all the subjects who are identi ed as high-risk sub-jects are required to undergo all the high-cost tests because the doctors need the results to conduct the tele-consultation.
Let us assume that there are I subjects who will come for the health checkup. We have J checkup tests where M include a questionnaire and are low-cost tests, and the others are high-cost tests. Each subject will be offered the J tests in a sequence of (1 ; 2 ; ; J ). Let c j be the cost of the j -th test. We consider the cost of low-cost test to be considerably smaller than that of any high-cost test; thus, we assume that c j = 0 for all j 2 f 1 ; 2 ; ; M g , and c j &gt; 0 for all j f
M +1 ; M +2 ; ; J g . When the i -th subject takes the j -th test, we obtain a d j dimensional feature vector x ij 2 R d Let m ij 2 f 0 ; 1 g indicate whether the i -th subject takes the j -th test ( m ij = 1) or not ( m ij = 0).

Let r i 2 f 0 ; 1 g indicate whether the i -th subject is at a high risk ( r i = 1) or not ( r i = 0). According to the Bangladesh logic, a subject is at a high risk if at least one of the test result is high risk ; in such a case, the subject is immediately determined as high risk before he/she takes all the J tests. On the other hand, we cannot completely determine whether a subject is a low-risk one until all the tests are conducted.

Our goal is to predict whether a subject is at a high risk or not, and to output the predictions ^ r i 2 f 0 ; 1 g for all i f 1 ; 2 ; ; I g . There is a practical constraint that we must offer all the tests to any subject who is predicted as high risk because we use the results in the tele-consultation session. That is, m ij must be set to one for all j 2 f 1 ; 2 ; ; J for i 2 f 1 ; 2 ; ; I g such that ^ r i = 1.
An unsophisticated way of obtaining f ^ r i g i : I is to have all the subjects take all the tests. Note that we use \ i : I " to indicate i 2 f 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; I g for notational simplicity. This approach correctly determines the risk of all the subjects, i.e., ^ r i = r i for all i 2 f 1 ; 2 ; ; I g ; however, we need the following amount of money to perform all the tests: C = I  X  the costs of checkups.
A simple strategy for applying a predictive approach is to build a single classi er that predicts the subject risks given the results of the low-cost tests. This strategy involves con-ducting all the tests on a subject if the subject is predicted to be a high-risk one; otherwise, no high-cost test will be of-fered. Further, the outcomes of a subject who takes all the tests provide the groundtruth label r i , which can be used to improve the classi er.
 The procedure for this strategy is as follows:
Step 1. We offer all the tests to the rst N subjects,
Step 2. For each i 2 f N +1 ; N +2 ; ; I g , the i -th subject The total execution cost of this strategy is C = N  X  subject who takes the ( M + 1)-th test is also offered the other high-cost tests in the procedure above. This proce-dure enables us to save the costs of high-cost tests for the subjects who are predicted as low-risk subjects; however, it may cause false-negative errors where a high-risk subject is incorrectly predicted as a low-risk one. 1
One careful strategy to avoid false-negative errors is to separately decide if we should offer each high-cost test to each subject. Suppose a case where a subject is predicted to be a low-risk subject on the basis of the outcomes of the low-cost tests. The strategy using a single classi er will decide that we do not need to offer all the high-cost tests to the subject. If the subject is actually at a high risk, this strategy causes a false-negative error. A careful strategy is designed to perform the rst high-cost test (e.g., urine test) even if the classi er considers the subject to be at a low risk. If the urine test indicates an abnormality, the subject will be identi ed as a high-risk one. If not, we can apply another classi er that uses the result of the urine test as well as that of the low-cost tests to predict the risk. Because this classi er uses additional information, it may provide a more accurate prediction than the rst one. When the second classi er also predicts that the subject is at a low risk, this strategy will offer the next high-cost test to the subject.
F alse-positive errors do not occur in our setting because a subject predicted as a high-risk subject is offered all the tests, and thus, we observe the correct risk outcome.
In a nutshell, this strategy conducts high-cost tests one by one, gradually extracts the subject information, and care-fully decides whether we should identify the subject as a low-risk one and skip the high-cost tests. If the subject is considered to be a high-risk one by a classi er, all the rest of the tests will be conducted on the subject. We call this strategy conservative and show its detailed operation as fol-lows:
Step 1. We offer all the tests to the rst N subjects, and
Step 2. For each i 2 f N +1 ; N +2 ; ; I g , the i -th subject
This conservative strategy only cuts the cost of the last high-cost test, and the total checkup cost will be C = N  X  egy commits to avoid the false-negative errors rather than substantially reducing the checkup costs.
We can consider another strategy that aggressively re-duces the costs by omitting the high-cost tests. This aggres-sive strategy does not offer the high-costs tests to subjects if the rst classi er predicts that they are at a low risk given the outcomes of the low-cost tests. If the classi er predicts a subject as a high risk, then the rst high-cost test will be conducted on the subject and the result is used to make an-other prediction. In this manner, this strategy excludes all the rest of the high-cost tests and cuts the costs if a classi er predicts the subject as a low-risk one. The procedure for this strategy is given by modifying Step 2.2 in the conservative strategy: Step 2.2. For each j 2 f M; M +1 ; ; J 1 g , when the j -th
The total execution cost of the aggressive strategy is given by C = N
We evaluate the approaches using the Bangladesh health checkup dataset and compare their false-negative rates and the total required cost.
We used the health checkup data of 15 ; 075 subjects. All of the features except for measurements of the hemoglobin level and the responses to the optional questions in the ques-tionnaire were used. In the experiments, we assumed that the subjects would visit the health checkup booth in the original order in our eld study.

There were two high-cost tests in the experiments: urine test and blood sugar test. We assumed that all the subjects took the high-costs tests in a xed order, and we conducted the experiments in both cases where the urine test was of-fered rst and where the blood sugar test was offered rst.
We employed an L2-regularized logistic regression imple-mentation (sklearn.linear mo del.SGDClassi er) provided by scikit-learn [10]. This implementation incrementally learns the model by using stochastic gradient descent so that we can improve the classi er when we get a new sample. We built classi ers that predict the probability of a subject be-ing at a high risk, returns 1 if the probability is greater than a threshold , and returns 0 otherwise. The thresh-The same threshold was applied to all the classi ers when we evaluated the multiple-classi er strategies. The hyperpa-rameters of the classi ers were determined by using a ve-fold cross validation on the training data that was composed of the outcomes of the rst N subjects. The size of the train-ing data N was chosen from N = 785 (5%), 1570 (10%), and 3141 (20%).

The performances were measured by the false-negative rate and the cost rate. The cost rate indicates the pro-portion of the cost required by each approach to the cost of offering all the tests to all the subjects.
The results are shown in Figure 3. It is noticed that across all the sizes of training data, the multiple-classi er strategies with starting with the urine-test substantially re-duced the costs of the health checkup while maintaining a small false-negative rate. In particular, in the case where N = 785 (5%), our multiple-classi er approach showed a signi cant cost reduction. The aggressive strategy achieved the false-negative rate. false-negative ratio = 1 : 1% when cost ratio = 51 : 5%, and the conservative strategy reached false-negative ratio = 0 : 9% when cost ratio = 51 : 6%. The two methods success-fully reduced the 50% of the costs with the very rare occur-rence of a false-negative error. Considering the fact that we need at least 33 : 7% of the costs to offer the high-cost tests to the subjects who are actually at a high risk, we can con-clude that the multiple-classi er approach demonstrated a considerable performance.

We observed that we obtained lower false-negative rates when we rst conducted the urine test. The reason behind this is that the classi er using the results of both the low-cost tests and the urine test is more accurate than the one using the results of the low-cost tests and the blood sugar test. Let us compare the AUC of both classi ers that were trained with N = 1 ; 570 (10%) samples. The former clas-si er achieved an AUC of 0 : 991, while the latter classi er scored an AUC of 0.844. Incorporating the results of the urine test will be bene cial from two perspectives: the urine test returns three outcomes (urine (protein), urine (sugar), and urine (urobilinogen)), and there is a strong relation-ship between urine sugar and blood sugar. The latter point is supported by the fact that among the subjects who were classi ed as Affected or Emergency on the basis of the blood sugar test, 79 : 4% were also classi ed as Affected or Emer-gency on the basis of the urine (sugar) test. When the urine test was conducted rst, and the results of the test were used to predict whether a subject was at a high risk, we only needed to predict an abnormality of blood sugar so that the information of urine (sugar) contributed to the predictions.
The classi er using the results of the low-cost tests and the blood sugar test needed to predict the overall risk level with-out observing the outcomes of urine (protein), urine (sugar), and urine (urobilinogen). Although blood sugar and urine sugar are correlated, there was no correlation observed be-tween blood sugar and the other two; thus, the classi er was not as accurate as the one using the results of low-cost tests and the urine test. In addition, the false-negative rate of the multiple-classi er strategy starting with the blood sugar test was higher than that of the single-classi er strategy across almost all the cost rates. Because the classi er using only the results of the low-cost tests achieved an AUC of 0 : 826, which is comparable to the AUC of the classi er using the results of the low-cost tests and the blood sugar test, it was not helpful to collect the results of the blood sugar test while the test was relatively expensive.

Investigating the trained classi cation model, we observed several important factors affecting the detection of the sub-ject risk levels. A subject was likely to be at a high risk according to the overall risk level when his/her result of arrhythmia, blood pressure, or body-mass index was cate-gorized as Affected or Emergency . In contrast, a subject was likely to be at a low risk as per the overall risk level when his/her result of blood pressure, body-mass index, or body temperature was categorized as Healthy . We also found that the responses to the questionnaire were helpful for discov-ering the high-risk subjects. If subjects answered that they periodically took anti-diabetic medicine, they had a high probability of being at a high risk.

For applying our multiple-classi er approach, users need to prede ne the strategy, conservative or aggressive, they want to use and the threshold parameter. Because the choice of a suitable setting depends on the requirements of the to-tal cost and the false-negative rate, we recommend that the users rst conduct an initial experiment by collecting the results of all the high-cost tests for a small number of sub-jects, apply the strategies with varying thresholds, and plot the results as shown Figure 3 to determine the appropriate setting to use.
Next, we address the problem of predicting drugs that should be prescribed for each subject on the basis of the results of the health checkup. The aim of this prediction is to support doctors and to reduce their workloads. We also study the drug recommendation from the outcomes of the low-cost tests. If we provide an accurate recommendation based on them, we can reduce the costs of the high-cost tests.
Let us assume that there are I subjects and J tests. Using the same method as that described in the Section 3.1, when the i -th subject takes the j -th test, we incur the cost of c and obtain the feature vector x ij .

We assume that there are L types of drugs. When a doc-tor conducts a tele-prescription session, the subject will be provided a drug prescription specifying at least one drug. Let p i = ( p i 1 ; p i 2 ; ; p iL ) denote the prescription for the i -th subject, where p il = 1 if the l -th drug is prescribed to the subject, and p il = 0 otherwise. Note that the doctors require the outcomes of all the low-cost and high-cost tests of the subject to prepare a prescription for the subject.
Our goal is to predict the prescriptions and to output the predictions f ^ p i g i : I .
We assume that we have the N prescriptions provided from the doctors, and apply supervised learning methods to train predictors. We study three approaches to build the predictors.
We rst present a simple method to train a discrete clas-si er ^ g Jl ( ) for each l 2 f 1 ; 2 ; ; L g . We call this approach single-task learning . The classi er ^ g Jl ( ) takes the feature vectors f x ij g j 2 1 ; 2 ; ;L and returns 1 if the l -th drug should be ordered to the i -th subject; otherwise, it returns 0. When we use the results of all the low-cost and the high-cost tests for the prediction, the total costs of providing recommenda-tions for all the subjects will be C = I
One can presume that the order of drugs is associated to one another. Multi-task learning has been proposed for such a case where there are multiple related prediction tasks. A multi-task learning method builds a classi er ^ g J ( ) that takes the feature vectors f x ij g j : J and returns f 0 ; 1 we use the results of all the low-cost and the high-cost tests for the prediction, the total costs will be C = I well.
We also attempt to make predictions only from the results of the low-cost tests. In this case, we build the classi er ^ g ( ) that takes the feature vector x i 1 as input and returns f 0 ; 1 g L . This approach only needs the cost of training data; thus, the total cost will be C = N the cost of offering the high-cost tests to N I subjects.
We evaluate the accuracy of the prediction approaches by using the actual prescription data collected through our eld study.
We used the data of 2 ; 461 subjects who took the tele-prescription sessions. When a prediction approach employed the results of all the low-cost and high-cost tests, we used all the checkup items described in Section 2.1.
 Table 2: Averages and standard deviations of AUC for all the target drugs
W e employed an implementation of multi-task learning (sklearn.linear mo del.MultiTaskLasso) provided by scikit-learn [10], which deploys a multi-task learning method with an L1/L2 mixed-norm regularizer [7]. Further, we ap-plied an implementation of the L1-regularized linear re-gression method (sklearn.linear mo del.Lasso) for compar-ing the single-task and the multi-task learning methods. Hyperparameters for each method were determined by us-ing a ve-fold cross validation on the prescriptions of rst N = 1476 (60%) subjects. The prescriptions of the rest of the subjects were used for testing. We selected 32 out of 49 drugs that were prescribed to at least ve subjects in the test data for a reasonable comparison. We use the AUC values for measuring the accuracy.
Averages and standard deviations of AUC over all the tar-get drugs are shown in Table 2. It is observed that compared with the single-task method and multi-task methods, the multi-task methods produced more accurate prediction than the single-task method. We also found that the method us-ing only the low-cost features is comparable to the one that uses both the low-cost and high-cost features; the difference between the average AUC of multi-task learning with the low-cost and high-cost features and that of multi-task learn-ing with the low-cost features is only 1 : 6%.

Prediction performance for each drug is illustrated in Fig-ure 4. Multi-task learning with low-cost and high-cost fea-tures achieved an AUC of more than 0 : 8 in the case of 4 out of 32 drugs. The high scoring drugs are as follows: oral hy-poglycemic drugs , drugs for angina and ischaemic heart dis-eases , drugs for hypertension , and drugs for iron de ciency anaemias . The method particularly showed an appreciable recommendation performance with AUC=0 : 938 for oral hy-poglycemic drugs . However, the performance for this drug became inferior when we used the multi-task learning with low-cost features; it scored an AUC of 0 : 761. The results of the blood sugar test, one of the high-cost tests, would be im-portant to make an accurate recommendation of this drug. For the three other drugs, the method without using the re-sults of high-cost tests worked as good as the one using the results of both tests. This is a promising result toward re-ducing the checkup costs to make recommendations of these three drugs.

We also observed that the standard deviation of the single-task learning method was relatively larger than that of the multi-task learning method. This indicates that the multi-task learning method provides stable drug recommenda-tions.
We examined the model obtained by multi-task learn-ing with the results of the low-cost tests. We found that blood pressure was the main factor for predicting the need for drugs for angina and ischemic heart diseases and drugs for hypertension . Investigating the classi cation model built by multi-task learning with the results of the low-cost and high-cost tests, we found that blood sugar was a key fac-tor in determining that subjects required oral hypoglycemic drugs . These ndings supported our consideration that the results of the blood sugar test were important for providing an accurate recommendation of such a drug.
Finally, we target the process of follow-up checkups. The aim of this process is to take care of the subjects who still have a health problem or who become high-risk subjects after a checkup. If we only have a limited budget for the follow-up process, it will be more efficient to set the priority to subjects who are currently classi ed as high-risk subjects. We discuss the use of prediction approaches to determine the priority.
Let us assume that there are I subjects who are the targets of the follow-up checkups. We are given the outcomes of the previous checkups f x i g for each i 2 f 1 ; 2 ; ; I q 2 f 0 ; 1 g indicate the current risk level of the i -th subject. We need to examine whether each subject is currently at a high risk ( q i = 1) or not ( q i = 0). The cost c is required to investigate the current risk level of each subject; that is, we will be given the current risk of a subject q i if we spend the cost of c ; otherwise, we will not observe it. We also assume that there is a budget constraint C .

Our goal is to determine the priority of subjects on the basis of the results of previous checkups so that we can ex-amine as many of the high-risk subjects as possible under the budget constraint.
We can also apply the prediction approaches to address this problem. First, we offer the follow-ups to N subjects, where N is assumed to be a small number. Using the N sample, we train an initial classi er ^ h ( ) that takes the out-comes of the previous checkup f x i g as input and predicts the probability of the i th subject being at high risk, i.e., ^ h ( x i ) = Pr [ q i = 1 j x i ]. We use the output of this classi er to decide the next subject to offer the follow-up checkup. When the i -th subject is investigated, we obtain the new label q i , which we can use for improving the classi er.
We present two selection strategies that determine the next subject to be taken care of.
The rst strategy, called exploitation-only , always selects the subject who is the most likely to be at high risk. Namely, by using the classi er ^ h ( ), this strategy selects the i -th subject by evaluating where I corresponds to a set of subjects who have not had a follow-up yet.
If we have a well-trained classi cation and it precisely se-lects the high-risk subjects, the exploitation-only strategy may work efficiently. However, because of the budget con-straint, we have recourse to a classi er trained with a small number of samples and need to incrementally improve the classi er. Choosing the high-risk subjects is not always a good strategy for improving the classi er, because it is likely to collect similar samples. A reasonable solution is to select subjects that are informative in order to improve the classi-er as well as the high-risk subjects. Thus, we can achieve a balance between exploration (acquiring new information) and exploitation (taking the most bene cial action based on the knowledge obtained thus far).

A simple strategy called epsilon-greedy has been proposed in the area of reinforcement learning to achieve a suitable trade-off between exploration and exploitation [16]. This strategy randomly chooses a sample (i.e., subject) with the probability of  X  and selects the sample expected to yield the highest return with the probability of 1  X  . In our problem, the sample selected with the probability of 1  X  corresponds to a subject at high risk.

We further modify the epsilon-greedy strategy by incorpo-rating the notion of active learning to make it more appro-Fi gure 5: Coverage rate of high-risk subjects ver-sus the cost of follow-up checkup. The exploration-and-exploitation strategy signi cantly improves the coverage of the original follow-up procedure. priate for classi cation problems. Active learning is a frame-work where an algorithm iteratively selects an informative sample and query whose label. Uncertainty sampling is a common algorithm. In the binary classi cation case, the al-gorithm selects the sample with the least certainty of being positive; that is, it chooses the i -th subject by evaluating
We combine uncertainty sampling and the epsilon-greedy strategy and implement our exploration-and-exploitation strategy for determining the priority of the subjects. In each step, our strategy selects the most uncertain subject by us-ing (2) with the probability of  X  , and selects the subject who is the most likely to be at high risk by using (1) with the probability of 1  X  . It is worth noticing that this strategy is applicable in other problems, such as collecting positive samples from an unlabeled multi-relational dataset [2].
We compare the proposed active learning approach with the original follow-up procedure in terms of the coverage rate under budget constraints.
We used the data of 2 ; 109 subjects who underwent both the rst-year checkup and the second-year checkup. All of the features except for measurements of the hemoglobin level and optional questionnaires were used. We catego-rized the subjects with Affected and Emergency risk lev-els into the high-risk group, and the others are in the low-risk groups; they are used for the class labels. We em-ployed an L2-regularized logistic regression implementation (sklearn.linear mo del.SGDClassi er), whose hyperparame-ters were determined by using a ve-fold cross validation on the rst N = 21 (1%) subjects who underwent the second-year checkups.

The hyperparameter  X  for the exploration and exploita-tion strategy was chosen from f 0 : 2 ; 0 : 5 ; 0 : 8 g ; we ran 10 ex-periments for each of them. We used the coverage rate of high-risk subjects under budget constraints as the perfor-mance measure, which is de ned as the ratio of the number of high-risk subjects covered by predictions to the total num-ber of high-risk subjects. We investigated the coverage rate by varying the cost rate, and the ratio of the subjects we can offer the follow-up checkups to under the budget constraint. We compared the two strategies, namely, the exploitation-only strategy and the exploration-and-exploitation strategy, with the actual follow-up order and the ideal order.
Figure 5 shows that both of the proposed active learn-ing strategies reach better high-risk subject coverage for all choices of  X  , which indicates that they are efficient sampling strategies.

For example, when the budget constraint is at 40%, the ac-tual coverage rate is 46 : 4%, while the exploitation-only strat-egy achieved 60 : 5% and the exploration-and-exploitation strategy with  X  = 0 : 8 achieved 66 : 6% coverage. Among the proposed strategies, not much difference is observed up to 0 : 15 cost rate. For higher cost rates, higher coverage rates were achieved by the exploration-and-exploitation strategy; this is probably because it selected more informative samples to improve the classi er. The exploration-and-exploitation strategy showed the best and most stable performance at  X  = 0 : 8, which puts emphasis the importance of on collect-ing informative samples.

The trained model indicated that the responses on the questionnaire were helpful for detecting subjects who were still at high risk or who became high-risk subjects after the previous checkup. For example, if subjects answered they did not periodically consult with doctors in the previous checkup , they were likely to be at high risk in the follow-up checkup. Conversely, if subjects answered that they walked faster than the other people of the same sex and similar age, they were expected to be at low risk when the follow-up was conducted.
There have been many projects aimed at improving healthcare in developing countries. Ramachandran et al. showed that lifestyle modi cation could prevent type 2 di-abetes in Asian Indian subjects [12], Rajput et al. stud-ied an Android-based mHealth system in South Africa [11], and Ramachandran et al. conducted an intervention pro-gram in India by using mobile phone messaging for getting advice and support for lifestyle modi cation [13]. While these authors and we share the ultimate goal, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the rst attempt at introduc-ing machine learning approaches for supporting preventive medicine programs in developing countries.

Clinical risk prediction has been studied for speci c dis-eases such as Alzheimer's disease [14, 17, 18], heart fail-ure [17], and leukemia [3]. These studies built predic-tion models from different types of medical data such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal uid, and ow cytometry. Ng et al. devel-oped a general framework for clinical risk prediction us-ing electronic health records (EHR) [5]. Our risk predic-tion method follows this line; however, we focus on a situa-tion where we do not have much information about subjects and we need to reduce the costs of the checkups. A few drug systems have been proposed for supporting physicians, such as a system that predicts patient abilities to protect themselves from infectious diseases and uses this informa-tion for selecting appropriate drugs [15], or a case-based sys-tem that retrieves similar patients from previous prescrip-ti on records [4]. These systems do not consider the costs of collecting information about the patients.
We have reported on our feasibility study to apply predic-tive modeling approaches to a low-cost preventive medicine program in Bangladesh. Through the evaluation using real data collected from a eld experiment in Bangladesh, we showed that our approach with multiple classi ers success-fully reduced the costs of health checkups, a multi-task learning method provided accurate recommendation for spe-ci c types of drugs, and an active learning method achieved an efficient assignment of healthcare workers to the follow-up cares of subjects.

One possible future work is to deploy the predictive ap-proaches used in this study to actual preventive medicine programs. Developing more sophisticated methods to as-sign budgets and human resources in preventive medicine programs is also a promising research direction to popular-ize preventive medicine.
