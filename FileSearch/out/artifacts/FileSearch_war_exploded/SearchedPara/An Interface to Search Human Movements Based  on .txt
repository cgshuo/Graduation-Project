 Historians and scholars can better understand histo ric events by studying the geographic and chronological activity of individuals who witnessed them. A lack of adequate tools to he lp users study these activities can hinder the process of learning and discovery. In this paper we present an interface to address th is problem that contains three components: a map, a timeline, and a text representation of a survivor X  X  movements. These co mponents simultaneously provide query input (where users can specify their needs) and dynamic results display (where users can immediately see the effect of their decisions). The results of a pilot study show that users reacted positively to the interface. H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval] Human Factors, Experimentation. The Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundatio n has assembled an extensive collection of interviews wit h survivors of the Holocaust. More than 50,000 survivors provided video testimonies in 32 languages, chronicling their expe riences before, during and after the Second World War. This large collection of first-hand experiences has been extensively indexed by subject matter experts, greatly increasing its potential va lue to historians and other scholars. Scholars often use oral histori es to complement written records, tell of undocumented ev ents and provide explanations, interpretations and perspecti ves [1]. One aspect of that broad effort is characterization of human migration, both voluntary and forced. One of the goals of the MALACH (Multilingual Access to Large Spoken Archives) proj ect is to develop interface tools that will help scholars und erstand and analyze the human movements that are described in t he Shoah Foundation X  X  collection. The geographic and temporal nature of the data clea rly calls for presenting more than a simple ranked list of retrie val results. The interface design presented here therefore uses grap hical representations of the time and location to facilit ate interaction, serendipity and learning. The results update dynam ically in response to inputs from the user without requiring an explicit  X  X earch X  action. Our interface uses a zoomable map display as in [2], but it has been designed to depict individual experiences, rather than describing historical events. To this end, the interface only shows data for one survivor at a time. A search on the system is a two-stage process. Sta ge One begins with query input (as free text) and ends with ident ification of testimonies that match the query. The manually ass igned metadata for each segment includes segment boundari es, an average of five concept keywords drawn from a custo m-built thesaurus, at least one pre-coordinated location-ti me pair, a carefully edited three-sentence summary, and names of all mentioned individuals (in normalized form). Testim ony-scale metadata (e.g., the survivor X  X  name and birthplace) is also searched. The searcher can re-sort the initial res ults by speaker name, speaker date of birth, the names of mentioned individuals, locations described in the segment, or the time fra me described by the segment (typically with one-year granularity) a nd select a speaker whose movements are of interest. The resul t of that selection (Stage Two of the process, depicted in Fi gure 1) is the focus of this paper. The interface design is based on the principle of intentional redundancy, depicting search results in three overlapping ways: a zoomable map , a timeline , and a results list . Map: The main purpose of the map is to show the movemen t of a selected survivor between geographic locations, rep resented by connected line segments. Each location is numbered indicating the order in which the locations were visited (base d on automatic decomposition of the pre-coordinated location-time pairs). Arrowheads indicating the direction of movement are included. Color ( X  X ed-shift X ) is also used to visually convey the passage of time, the initial line segment is rendered in a (sh ort wavelength) violet hue, proceeding through the spectrum to a (l ong wavelength) red hue at the end. In addition to use as a display, the map can serve as a source of spatial queries; u sers can mark a region and then locate all survivors that passed th rough a location in that region. The timeline allows further refine ment, limiting a query to those who were there during a specific per iod. Timeline: The timeline organizes events chronologically (i.e ., as-lived, rather than as-told). Places visited by the person are listed on the left side and ranges corresponding to time i ntervals are drawn to the right of the location names, verticall y aligned with the timeline below. The map and timeline are coupl ed; the numbered timeline segments correspond to the number s on the map, and the timeline colors correspond to the colo rs on the map. Using a combination of the map and timeline, users can get a feeling for the distances traveled and the time sp ent doing so. Results List: When the second stage search is initially complete d, the survivor X  X  name and movements are shown in the list in the format place, time . The results list may be searched by place (i.e., find all survivors who went to a particular place) or by time and place (i.e., find all survivors in the same place at the same time). The metadata characteristics pose some design chall enges. This is evident in Figure 1 where the survivor is listed as being at three locations on April 2, 1944. In actuality, this is the start date of a period that is correctly depicted in the timeline ( our present text display was optimized for single dates (typically f ull years), which are more common in the collection). Even the timel ine contains ambiguity however; the indexed granularity cannot d etermine the order in which those three locations were visited ( or, indeed, whether repeated visits occurred during that period ). We recruited 4 subjects for a pilot evaluation to t est the usability of the interface. All were graduate students study ing either History (2), Information Science (1) or Computer Sc ience (1). The pilot study was designed to gather qualitative data on subject perceptions of the interface and of the search proc ess. Two of the four subjects (one historian and the information sc ientist) had some knowledge of the collection X  X  metadata structu re before participating. Short task scenarios were devised t hat required subjects to use the interface to: (i) find many peo ple who were in certain locations at certain times (e.g., Find survivors who were in Bucharest on May 8 1945 ), (ii) track the location of one survivor over time (e.g., Select a survivor and describe their movements ) and (iii) comment on differences between two given survivors that relate to their movements (e.g., Select two survivors and describe the differences in their movements ). Sessions lasted about 30 minutes, and the subjects were asked to  X  X hink alou d X  as they searched. We observed them and made written notes on their interaction and comments that may influence design decisions. Overall, subjects responded positively to the inter face, although there was a noticeable divide between the historian s and others. Generally, the subjects found the different forms o f result presentation useful, especially when there was unce rtainty over the location. The map was the most commonly used f orm of query input by all subjects as they felt it encoura ged exploration, was not confusing and was a relatively robust way t o refine the result set. All subjects felt that the timeline sh ould be used only in combination with the map and/or the results list because the information it displayed was occasionally ambiguous . The two historians generally wanted to compare a nu mber of individuals over a period of time, arrange people b y status (such as in a camp, in hiding, or in transport) and wante d to be able to compare an individual to others in the same situati on. In essence, the historians wanted to construct a story. In con trast, our computer and information scientists wanted to narro w their search using query terms rather than using the other inter face components to directly manipulate the results displ ay. The computer and information scientists generally wante d to find small pieces of relevant information. The historia ns reacted more positively to the interface, probably because they were more likely to conduct exploratory searches, something they fel t was well supported in this interface. The interface described in this paper includes an u nusually close coupling between output and input, reflecting the w ay in which answers to initial questions naturally facilitate t he generation of new questions. At present, each user interaction i s treated in isolation and leads directly to output at the inter face. Subjects liked this as it allowed them to immediately see th e outcome of their actions and follow new search directions wher e appropriate. However, the computer and information scientists bo th felt that a useful addition would be the ability to perform a s eries of related interactions, then see the output. They felt this would allow them to construct complex queries and refine their searc h more rapidly. Our study also found that different interface compo nents (or combinations of components) were useful for differe nt searches. When subjects searched for survivors in a given pla ce on a given date, they used only the results list. When asked to track the location of an individual over time, the map, the t imeline and the results list were all used. Finally, when asked to compare the movements of two survivors, subjects used only the map and the timeline. Since the interface should reasonably be expected to handle all such searches we felt it would be wise t o show the map, timeline and results list as the default display. However, two subjects suggested that it may also be helpful to g ive users control over which components are displayed at the interfac e and the proportion of the interface devoted to each compone nt to reduce potential distraction and interface clutter. Work is ongoing to simultaneously display the movem ents of multiple survivors and to visually represent uncert ainty that results from metadata characteristics, including fu ture sources of metadata (e.g., extraction of location names from a utomatically produced transcripts). Our initial pilot study sug gests that our basic design is suitable for use by well trained sc holars, and with further enhancement we hope to develop these ideas into a set of effective and intuitive interfaces for exploration of a broad array of oral history collections by scholars, teachers, and others.
