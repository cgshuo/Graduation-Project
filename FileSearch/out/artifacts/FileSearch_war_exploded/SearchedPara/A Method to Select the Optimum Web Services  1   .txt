 Recently, web services have emerged as a new paradigm that supports loosely increasingly merging, to find a required web service has become easier. More attention has been paid to select the optimum one from a set of requirements-satisfying ones. 
For web services selection, most current methods are based on QoS(the service services and the evaluation information of users. However they only emphasize some applications, different users may evaluate a same web service differently. 
In this paper, we propose a workflow-organization-model based method to objective quality value in web services QoS model into consideration. The reputation sum. According to the resulted sums, us ers can select the optimum web service. 
The structure of this paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, section optimum web service selection. Then we propose a workflow-model-based method to evaluation of web services quality values and the services selection. Finally, we give the summary and future works. With web technology developing, the web services providing same functions have become more and more. Thus, how to select the optimum web services has been attracting much attention. 
In [4], the authors propose a quality model for web services composition. It manages to globally make the composition expense optimum in a linear way, but the selection of a single web service isn X  X  taken into consideration. [5] gives a workflow-expense. However it also doesn X  X  consider the single web service selection. A dynamic QoS model is put forwards in [6], through which the values of services will information, which are very important for se rvice selection. The authors of [7] present a log-based QoS model. This model computes the service quality according to the log account. In [8], the authors discuss an agen t-based selecting method, which involves evaluation and the subjective quality values of web services are also not considered in selection process. 
In this paper, our method of selection can not only take into account the reputation the details. The whole selection process can be executed in 5 steps, which is shown in Fig.1. former users fulfilling the task. values of all web services for the current user. services QoS model. multiply them by related weights then add up the products to generate the result sum. Then the user can decide the optimum web service to execute. user and other former users. those tasks having a fixed procedure in daily life. The organization model of workflow describes the level of people interacting with the workflow, who are located in different groups by their roles. Among these groups, some may be contained by others, such as group B and C belong to group A. Note that, each user may have multiple roles, so that he may exist in multiple groups. In Fig.2, the user s1 belongs to both group D and group E. 
Based on the organization model of workflow, the calculation process has 3 steps: equal to C s2s1 . For each two users s1 and s2 , s1  X  s2 groups. D s1max denotes the distance from s1 to the user who is farthest to s1 . As shown in Fig.2, D s1s2 =1, D s1s5 =3. If D s1max =8, then C s1s2 =1, C s1s5 =0.75. 
After obtaining the initial confidence according to formula 1, we can calculate the reputation value of a web service related to some task as follows: the value of which is in the range of 0 and 1. 
The result of confidence obtained by formula 1 is just an initial value. When a user has executed a web service, he needs to make evaluation of this service, which will be fed back to the initial confidence to calculate a new confidence value. This feedback evaluated the web service being selected to execute by the current user. The feedback formula is shown as follows: Where service w i respectively, | | evaluation of user a and sj to web service w i ,  X  between the evaluation of user a and all users who have evaluated w i , p={1,-1}, and if condition: The resulted reputation value is just a subjective experience one. In practical application, we should also take the subjective quality value into consideration that is evaluated based on the QoS model of web services. 5.1 Calculation of Web Services Quality Values Here we only consider two factors related to the web service quality. provider from the user who calls the service. It will be denoted with q c . service to finishing execution. It will be denoted with q t . 
For all the web services corresponding to a task, we can establish a quality matrix and the two columns correspond the execution expense and execution time of w i respectively. services in the following two steps: Where w c and w t denote the weights of execution expense and execution time respectively and their sum is a constant 1. 5.2 Selection of Web Services The selection method is to first combine the reputation value with the quality value of each web service like formula 5, then select the maximum one from the value sums. Here  X  and  X  means the weights of reputation value and quality value respectively and Otherwise if  X  =1, it means we only take the latter into account. quality value computation. We X  X l make use of the log information of web services to compute the values, so that the selection of web services will be more appropriate for practical applications.
