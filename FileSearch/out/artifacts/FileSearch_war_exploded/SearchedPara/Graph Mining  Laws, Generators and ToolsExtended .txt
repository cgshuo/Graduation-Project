 How do graphs look like? How do they evolve over time? How can we gener-ate realistic-looking graphs? We revie w some static and temporal  X  X aws X , and we describe the  X  X ronecker X  graph generator, which naturally matches all of the known properties of real graphs. Mor eover, we present tools for discovering anomalies and patterns in two types of graphs, static and time-evolving. For the former, we present the  X  X enterPiece X  subgraphs (CePS), which expects q query nodes (eg., suspicious people) and finds the node that is best connected to all q of them (eg., the master mind of a criminal group). We also show how to com-pute CenterPiece subgraphs efficiently. For the time evolving graphs, we present tensor-based methods, and apply them on real data, like the DBLP author-paper dataset, where they are able to find natural research communities, and track their evolution.

Finally, we also briefly mention some results on influence and virus propaga-tion on real graphs.
