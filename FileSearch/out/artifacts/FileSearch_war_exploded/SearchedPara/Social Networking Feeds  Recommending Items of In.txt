 The success of social media has resulted in an information overload problem, where users are faced with hundreds of new contributions, edits and communications at every visit . A prime example of this in social networks is the news or activity feeds, where the actions (friending, commenting, photo sharing, etc) of friends on the network are presented to users in order to inform them of the network activity. In this work we endeavour to reduce the burden on individu-als of identifying interesting updates in social network ne ws feeds by automatically identifying and recommending rele-vant items to individuals where item relevance is based on the observed interactions of the individual with the social network. The results of our offline study show that combin-ing short term interest models, exploiting previous viewin g behavior of users, and long-term models, exploiting previo us viewing of network actions, was the best predictor of feed item relevance.

Information overload is a well documented problem in the context of the Web. In recent years, it has been compounded by the popularity of sites and systems, which promote the creation of user generated content. These include content sharing sites, such as YouTube and Flickr, blog hosting site s, such as Blogger and BlogNow, and social networking sites, such as Facebook and MySpace.

The popularity of social networks has surpassed all expec-tations [2] with Facebook alone reporting 400 million activ e users, with average user having 130 friends and spending 55 minutes a day on the site [1]. These users contribute con-tent such as photos and videos, join groups, make friends, post comments, and explore the content contributed by oth-ers. Social networks use news or activity feeds as a way of keeping users up to date with the actions of their friends. But, with the frequency of visits, high number of actions and friends, it can be difficult for people to identify the feed items, in which they have a genuine interest.

In this work investigate how to improve social network news feeds by making recommendations for individual items through the use of personalization techniques. We propose determining the relevance of users and actions to individ-uals as a basis to recommend relevant network activities. The relevance could be exploited to generate a personal-ized recommended subset of feed items reducing the problem of information overload. We investigate which interaction types are most predictive of user interest and how short and long term user interest models can be exploited for this pur-pose. We develop several techniques, scoring the relevance of news feed items according to user actions, such as friend-ing, browsing, and interacting with other users, and evalua te these techniques using the interaction logs of IBM X  X  Social -Blue (previously known as Beehive) social network users.
Social networks strive to keep users up to date with their friends activities on the network by including news or ac-tivity feeds in their home pages. The content of the feed relates to the actions of a target user X  X  friends and gener-ally informs the user of new content contributed (photos, groups, comments), new friendships made, groups joined, status message updates and other actions. Each item in the news feed comprises four components: the subject , who car-ried out the action, the action , which caused some change in content or state of the network, the object , on which the action was carried out (could be a user for friending actions or a content for posting or browsing actions), and the time , at which the action occurred.

The area of feed generation has been gathering much at-tention with Facebook recently being granted a patent [7] in dynamic news feed generation. Initial recognition of the in -formation overload problem in network feeds has also been seen. Some social networks, e.g. Facebook and MySpace, allow users to filter users or actions from their feeds, but this requires users to spend time customising their feeds an d block users or actions from appearing in the feed unless re-activated. Facebook also offers multiple views of feeds base d on popularity and recency. The standard method of network feeds X  delivery is a reverse chronologically ordered list, which shows all the activities of a user X  X  friends. However, it is u n-realistic to assume that each and every action of each and every friend is of a genuine interest to a user. Additionally , the activities of a highly active user may flood the ordered list, causing more relevant events to be missed. Our work aims to uncover approaches for recommending feed items to users. We determine feed relevance in a personalized manner by estimating user interest in both other users and actions. We hypothesise that this will allow us to recommend users and actions of highest interest and generate more informa-tive and relevant news feeds to the user.
Traditional feeds judge relevance according to the activit y time, which obviously eliminates any degree of personaliza -tion. We determine the relevance of a network activity item in the feed to a user by examining the observed user interac-tions of the individual over a period of time. To do this, we propose scoring the feed item based on all the components: user , action , object(s) and date . In this work we focus on only the user and the action involved in a feed item and pro-pose a way of quantifying the predicted interest level and, thus, the relevance of a feed item to a user.
We propose judging the relevance of an action, a c , to a tar-get user, u T in two ways. Firstly, we measure the regularity with which u T performs a c , e.g., posts a photo or creates a group between days d m and d n . Secondly, we measure the regularity with which u T views content created as a result of another user performing a c , e.g., views photos or views group pages between days d m and d n . As actions inherently have various applicability frequencies, i.e., some are done mor e frequently than others, we measure regularity as the ratio between the number of days where an action occurred and the number of days where it could have occurred, i.e., the relevance judgements.

Interact ( u T , a c , d i ) and V iew ( u T , a c , d i ) denote the in-dicators of interaction between user u T and action a c on day d i or viewing of content created by another user by completing action a c on d i . Interact ( u T , a c , d i partially normalizes the different applicability frequenc ies. More fine grained methods, including decay models and av-erage user frequencies, will be investigated in the future. interacted with a c on d i and 0 otherwise and, similarly, V iew ( u T , a c , d i ) = 1 if u T viewed content created as a result of performing a c on d i and 0 otherwise.
We propose judging the relevance of a user, u b , to a target user, u T , in two ways. Firstly, we measure the regularity with which u T directly interacts with u b , e.g., post a message on the message board of u b or comments on the content published by u b . Secondly, we measure the regularity with which u T views content created by u b , e.g., views the profile page of u b or views photos published by u b . Once again these measures are between days d m and d n . Other metrics such as mutual friends, common groups and the content of exchanged messages have been investigated as measures of tie-strength in social networking by [4, 6] but here we stick to this simple measure.

Similarly, we resolve the frequency variability by using da y based indicators of interaction or content viewing. Equa-tions 3 and 4 present the user centric relevance judgements. User int ( u T , u b , d m , d n ) = Interact ( u T , u b , d i ) = 1 if u T interacted with u 0 otherwise and V iew ( u T , u b , d i ) = 1 if u T viewed content created by u b on d i and 0 otherwise.
Both the user and action based relevance judgements can be determined over a short or long term basis. Long term in-terest models represent the stable interests of users, gath ered over the lifetime of their membership in the social network. In contrast, short term interest models are likely to be repr e-sent their current relevance judgements centered around th e days or weeks prior to a feed generation. Hence, the time frame of Equations 1, 2, 3, and 4 may vary in order to reflect the preferred granularity of the relevance judgements.
We conducted an offline evaluation using the interaction logs of SocialBlue [3]. SocialBlue X  X  news feed, known on the site as the Buzz, is displayed immediately after a user X  X  lo-gin and accessible throughout a session. The feeds include 17 types of actions, such as the addition of friends, photos, events, profile entries, comments on content, recommenda-tions, and updates of status messages. 15 items are displaye d on a single page, with additional items available on request . Figure 1 shows a sample feed with 3 items.

The purpose of the analysis is to determine the suitability of two relevance models, a short term model that captures the interactions over a 1 month period and a long term model that covers the entire membership, in generating relevance scores. Further to this, we compare the performance of the 4 relevance judgement algorithms presented in Section 3: two action based and two user based.
We selected 1800 of the most recent instances of browsing initiated through the activity feeds. To investigate long a nd short term relevance models, we selected instances related to users who had been a member of SocialBlue for 6 months or more. For each click, we determined the actual news feed shown to the user, i.e., the 15 most recent actions carried out by the user X  X  friends. We also generated two alternative feeds sets for each algorithm denoted by Equations 1-4. The first exploits a long term relevance model, i.e., d 1 is the first day of membership. The second exploits a short term relevance and focuses on interactions in one month prior to the feed generation, i.e., d 1 = d n  X  31. In both cases, d set to the day the feed was generated.

Equations 1-4 were used to rank the items in the alter-native feeds by allowing the relevance of a feed item f i to be determined by the relevance of the user or action components as determined by the equations.. For exam-ple, the Action int algorithm was used to assign relevance scores to each feed item and the items in a list denoted as Action int were ordered by decreasing relevance scores. Sim-ilarly, Equations 2-4 were used to generate the Action views User int and User views lists, respectively. We compare the performance of the relevance judgement approaches by ex-amining the ranked position of the selected items in the list s, favoring lists that placed the selected items at the top.
When considering the performance of each relevance met-ric in this offline study, we compare the performance of the personalized algorithms against each other, rather than wi th the time based algorithm used in SocialBlue. Research into trust and display positions of ranked lists have shown that users X  selection is strongly influenced by the ranking of lis t items [5] and we hypothesise that ranking factors would have influenced the users of SocialBlue. We noted strong preferences for feed items presented at the top of the result lists shown to SocialBlue users, with 50% of selections bein g made on feeds in the top two positions in the feed lists and 75% of selections within the first 5 result positions. Thus, the performance of personalized approaches in comparison to the time based metrics are best evaluated in an online live user study and here we concentrate on comparing the personalized approaches. We note however that the average position of a clicked feed item in the feeds presented to the users in Social Blue was 3.47.

Table 1 shows the average position of the selected feed items in each personalized feed, for both time frames con-combined 6.151 sidered. Note that lower positions indicate higher ranks in the feed and better performance. When judging the rel-evance of the action components of a feed item, the long term relevance model outperforms the short term model. The long term model places the feed items at position 7 . 356 and the short term model at 8 . 376 for the Action int and, re-spectively, at positions 7 . 037 and 7 . 498 for the Action T-tests revealed significant differences in performance be-tween the models at p &lt; 0 . 05. We see also that regardless of the interest model used the Action view approach outper-forms the Action int approach, again significant at p &lt; 0 . 05.
In contrast, when judging the relevance of the user com-ponents of a feed item, the short term relevance model out-performs the long term model. For the User int approach, positions of the long term and short term models are, respec-tively, 7 . 634 and 7 . 783, but the difference between the two is not statistically significant. For the User views approach, the positions are, respectively, 7 . 294 and 6 . 552, and the dif-ference between the short term and the long term model is statistically significant at p &lt; 0 . 05. Again, regardless of the interest model, the best performing approach is the one which examines the viewing behavior of the users.

These relevance judgements consider a single component of the feed item, either the user or the action. As in both cases viewing behavior outperformed the action/interacti on behavior, we generated another list for which we consider th e relevance of both actions and users. We compute the com-bined relevance score V iew ( u T , f i , d m , d n ) for feed item f averaging the action viewing relevance Action view ( u T , a d ) and the user viewing relevance User view ( u T , u i , d scores where u i is the user component of f i where a i is the ac-tion component of f i . The results of this combination, 6 . 606 for the long term and 6 . 263 for the short term model, out-perform the best performing individual approaches in both models (statistically significant at p &lt; 0 . 05), illustrating the contribution of both components of the feed items relevance . Further to this, we note that the performance of the short term model X  X  V iew algorithm significantly outperforms that of the long term interest model at p &lt; 0 . 05.

Action view ( u T , a i , d m , d n ) + User view ( u T , u
Our comparison of the long and short term models across users and actions however suggests that for optimal perfor-mance we should combine the relevance of actions from the long term relevance model and of users from the short term model. Thus, we compute the combined relevance score CombinedModels by averaging the long term action view-ing relevance Action view ( u T , a c , d m , d n ) where d the feed is generated d m is u t  X  X  join date and the short term user viewing relevance User view ( u T , a c , d m , d n ) in which d = d n  X  31 scores as in Equation 6. Action view ( u T , a i , d m , d n ) + User view ( u T , u
The result of this combination is an average position of 6.151 which significantly outperforms that of the long term views model (p &lt; 0.05) but does not significantly outperform that of the short term V iews algorithm which suggests that the user views interest model is of core importance to the performance of the V iews approaches.

The average rank of clicked items in Table 1 shows only the overall performance of each approach. Thus, we exam-ined the performance of each algorithm by examining the spread of feed items across the feed lists. Figure 2 shows the performance of the approaches in terms of the number of clicked feed items placed at each news feed position or resent the number of clicked items, placed at position 1 or 2. The short term relevance models are represented by dashed lines and the counterpart, long term models, by a solid line. The larger the number of clicked feed items placed high in the feed, the better the performance.

Examining the performance of the best performing ac-tion relevance approach, Action views , the long term model places more feed items in positions 1-5 than the short term model. In contrast, for the best performing user relevance approach, User view , the short term model outperforms the long term model. These differences are statistically signif -icant across all 15 result positions at p &lt; 0 . 05. Note the superior performance of the V iew approach in each model and, more importantly, the out performance of all models by the combined approach, which exploits both the action and user relevance models.
This work indicates the potential for personalized recom-mendation of social network events in a news feed. It points to the value of monitoring the interactions of users and also the viewing patterns of users to determine the relevance of users and actions on the network. Our offline study using the SocialBlue logs has demonstrated that short term rele-vance models are suitable for judging the relevance of net-work users, but that long term interest models are suitable were omitted for graph clarity. for judging the relevance of carried out actions. Further-more, our work shows that harnessing the browsing patterns of users, what and whom they view, are more accurate pre-dictors of relevance than what actions they carry out or with whom they communicate.

While the performance of the developed relevance models and their combinations could be compared, their comparison to chronological feeds cannot be assessed in an offline eval-uation. Hence, our next step is to incorporate our relevance models into a live social network, where our personalizatio n could be applied not only to re-rank the feed items, but also highlight the most relevant activities that have been carri ed out since a users last login. This could result in a much more valuable service to social network users.

This work aims to determine the relevance of actions and users in a social network, but its impact could go far beyond the production of feeds. Determination of online strength o f user relationships could be used for other recommendation purposes, including friend making, content sharing, and so -cial recommendations. Similarly, determining user intere st in action types could be used to determine user-user simi-larity or group interest models.
