 Bioinformatics is the science of managing, mining, and in-terpreting information from biological sequences and struc-tures. Genome sequencing projects have contributed to an exponen tial growth in complete and partial sequence databases. The structural genomics initiativ e aims to cat-alog the structure-function information for proteins. Ad-vances in technology such as microarra ys have launc hed the sub X eld of genomics and proteomics to study the genes, pro-teins, and the regulatory gene expression circuitry inside the cell. What characterizes the state of the  X eld is the  X  X od of data that exists today or that is anticipated in the future; data that needs to be mined to help unlock the secrets of the cell.
 While tremendous progress has been made over the years, many of the fundamen tal problems in bioinformatics, such as protein structure prediction or gene  X nding, are still open. Data mining will play a fundamen tal role in understanding gene expression, drug design and other emerging problems in genomics and proteomics. Furthermore, text mining will be fundamen tal in extracting knowledge from the growing literature in bioinformatics.
 BIOKDD'03 was held in conjunction with the 9th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Disco very and Data Mining, in Washington, DC, in August 2003. The goal of this workshop was to encourage KDD researc hers to take on the numerous challenges that Bioinformatics o X ers. The workshop featured keynote talks from noted experts in the  X eld, and the latest data mining researc h in bioinformat-ics; it encouraged papers that prop osed novel data mining techniques for tasks such as: The workshop proceedings contain 9 papers (out of 24 sub-missions) that were accepted for presen tation at the work-shop. Each paper was review ed by three mem bers of the program committee. Along with 2 keynote talks by Steven Salzb erg (from TIGR) and Sorin Istrail (from Celera), we were able to assem ble a very exciting program. A brief overview of the invited talks and contributed papers appears below.
 This workshop followed the previous two highly successful workshops: BIOKDD02 [2], held in Edmon ton, Canada, and BIOKDD01 [1] held in San Francisco, CA. Online proceed-ings of the BIOKDD workshops are accessible at the follow-ing links: The opening keynote talk for the morning session, entitled genome paleontolo gy: discoveries from complete genomes , was deliv ered by Steven Salzb erg, Senior Director of Bioin-formatics at The Institute for Genomic Researc h (TIGR). Steven de X ned genome paleon tology as the task of compar-ing genomes to unco ver: i) history of species, ii) genome transformations, iii) recen t mutations such as Single Nu-cleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and iv) evolution. He de-scrib ed the work his group has done on genome scale se-quence alignmen ts, the hunt for genome scale duplications, symmetric chromosomal inversions, Human genome analy-sis, horizon tal gene transfers, and other interesting prob-lems.
 The opening keynote talk for the afterno on session, enti-tled the minimum informative subset problem , was given by Sorin Istrail, Senior Director for Informatics Researc h at Celera Genomics/Applied Biosystems. Sorin introduced a recurring problem within bioinformatics, which he termed the minim um informativ e subset problem, de X ned as follows: given a set of objects,  X nd a minim um set of attributes that are informativ e. He highligh ted several applications of this problem, for example, SNP selection and haplot ype tagging, assay design, literature survey, and so on.
 The  X rst session in the morning consisted for four papers. Zhenzhen Kou, William Cohen, and Robert F. Murph y (Carnegie Mellon Univ ersity) presen ted their work on ex-tracting information from text and images for location pro-teomics . They introduced new text mining and OCR tech-niques for caption understanding, and  X gure-text matc hing, with applications to protein sub-cellular localization, from the text and images found in online journals. In the next paper Mark A. Krogel and Tobias Sche X er (Hum boldt Uni-versity, German y) studied the e X ectiveness of information extraction, multi-r elational, and multi-view learning for pre-dicting gene deletion experiments . To build a biologically relev ant model, they utilized all available data such as un-labeled data, relational data and abstracts from researc h papers. Jinyan Li, Huiqing Liu and Limso on Wong (Insti-tute for Infocomm Researc h, Singap ore) claimed that mean-entropy discretized features are e X ective for classifying high-dimensional biome dical data . The paper studied empirical feature selection heuristics, utilizing entropy, for classi X ca-tion of biomedical datasets. They show results on reduction in features obtained in practice. In the  X nal paper of the session, Marios Skounakis and Mark Craven (Univ ersity of Wisconsin, Madison) discussed their work on evidenc e com-bination in biome dical natur al-language processing . In many cases the individual entities or relations of interest are found in multiple contexts in a corpus. They presen t a statistical approac h to combine evidence across such multiple contexts. They apply the work to protein names and protein-protein interactions from MEDLINE.
 The second session in the afterno on, had two papers. Alek-sander Icev, Carolina Ruiz, and Elizab eth F. Ryder (Worces-ter Polytec hnic Institute), prop osed distanc e-enhanc ed as-sociation rules for gene expression . They mine associa-tion rules among motifs extracted from promoter regions of genes. The rules are extended with distances between motifs, and show impro vemen ts in classi X cation versus use of traditional association rules. Kevin Y. Yip, David W. Cheung and Michael K. Ng (Univ ersity of Hong Kong) pre-sented a highly-usable projected clustering algorithm for gene expression pro X les . Most existing projected clustering algo-rithms depend on several user speci X ed parameters, which are often ill understo od. Their new algorithm overcomes such limitations, and they study applications in mining gene expressions.
 In the  X nal session, there were three papers. Li Zhang, Aidong Zhang and Murali Ramanathan (Univ ersity of Buf-falo), opened with enhanc ed visualization of time series through higher Fourier harmonics . They studied metho ds for visualizing gene expression datasets using higher Fourier harmonics projections. Hsiao-Mei Lu, Sumeet Gupta, and Yang Dai (Univ ersity of Illinois, Chicago) gave metho ds for reducing large diagonals in kernel matric es through semidef-inite programming (SDP) . Application of Supp ort Vector Machines in Bioinformatics, may result in kernel matrices with large diagonal elemen ts. The paper used SDP to re-duce large kernels. Finally , Xintao Wu, Yong Ye, Kalpathi, and R. Subramanian (Univ ersity of North Carolina, Char-lotte), presen ted their work on interactive analysis of gene interactions using graphical gaussian model . The datasets came from DNA microarra y studies; they prop ose an inter-activ e system to explore gene relations. We would like to thank all the authors, invited speakers, and attendees for contributing to the success of the workshop.
