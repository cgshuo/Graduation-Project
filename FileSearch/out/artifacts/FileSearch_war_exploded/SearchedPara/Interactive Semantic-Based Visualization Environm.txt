 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a very huge and complex system of medicine same time, thousands of scientific studies that support traditional Chinese medical treatments are published yearly. Due to the rapid development of Web and information technology, innumerable disparate isolated medical databases have been developed in Web raise new challenges for Web clients to share and manage information effectively. Semantic Web [2] provides a common framework that allows information resources to retrieve and share large-scale information in a distributed environment by standardizing the protocols for metadata exchange. To fulfill this long-term goal, we need to build an intelligent environment for end-users to make use of large-scale and heterogeneous information. In this paper, we indicate a series of design principles for such an environ-ment and propose a novel semantic-based Web information client, called Semantic Browser [3][4], oriented data-intensive fields like TCM. tion on the client-side and semantics has been used broadly in organizing and integrat-ing information. Haystack [13] is an RDF based individual information management tool, which aims to enable users to define whichever arrangements of, connections between, and views of Web information they find most effective. However, the way it explores and annotates Web pages makes Haystack not differ from traditional Web browsers very much in essence. Prot X g X  [5] is an ontology development and knowl-edge acquisition environment with a graphical user interface and various ontology-based plugins. The server mode of Prot X g X  supports multiple users working simulta-cult to integrate distributed information resources into the Prot X g X  server dynamically and the form-based interface is not intuitive for exploration of information. On-toRama [11] is a prototype ontology browser, which takes RDF/XML as input format and models ontology as a configurable graph. However, the functionalities of On-toRama are restricted to browsing and querying is not supported yet. active information client and describe a novel semantic-based information client, called Semantic Browser, to resolve the problem of sharing and managing large-scale Web information towards data-intensive fields like TCM. TCM is a large-scale information system and has its own knowledge structure with a set of special and complex disciplines and concepts, so when constructing Web client for sharing and managing TCM information resources, we should consider the charac-teristics of the domain well. However, most of the existent researches and applica-tions in this area fail to domain requirements. 2.1 TCM Information Structure As a medical science that embodies Chinese culture and philosophical principles, TCM has its own particular information structure. With the rapidly growing popular-ity of computers and the development of the Web, most TCM information has been organized into information bases. semi-structured information, which can be processed by computers to some extent. Databases, knowledge bases and Web pages all can be categorized as Information Base. 
There are so many concepts in the field of TCM and each may be related to compose a complex network and even sophisticated TCM doctors cannot understand same time. However, within different genres or regions, the same concept may be represented by totally different terms in different information bases. For example, many Chinese medical formulas are retrieved from ancient literatures or synthesized medical formulas are retrieved from ancient literatures or synthesized from single can be stored in databases of different institutions. In database A , the title of Chinese medical formula is formula name and in database B , the title may be Chinese medi-cal formula name . When end-users query information about Chinese medical formu-matically, as they are two physically independent information resources, though the information in the two databases refers to the same concept. 2.2 Web Semantics We introduce semantics to resolve the problems above. RDF(S) is the basic frame-work for the Semantic Web and we can use RDF(S) to integrate distributed and het-erogeneous information bases in the Web environment. We propose a blueprint of architecture for semantic-based Web applications in figure 1. 1) Information bases such as TCM databases compose the Information Layer . 2) The Service Layer publishes various Web / Grid services. 3) The Knowledge Layer embodies well-defined semantics like Web ontologies, 4) The Semantic View Layer is dynamically constructed by Web clients and pro-information bases and extract ontologies from vast amount of original TCM informa-tion. We classify various TCM concepts in to eight top classes and each can be subdi-vided into several sub-classes. The inherited relations between TCM concepts form a class hierarchy tree about TCM knowledge (see figure 2). 
We can use semantic links (URI [2]) to organize complex relations within semantic information as intuitive relational graphs, which are so called Semantic Graphs . We herein give the generic definition of semantic graph as follow: Definition 2.2 ( Semantic Graph ) . A generic semantic graph is defined by the follow-mantic information is a semantic graph; (2) nodes labeled with a semantic link stand for concepts or individuals and arcs stand for properties in a semantic graph. A set of joint parallel semantic graphs with no cross also constitute a semantic graph. formation as a class hierarchy tree and a set of semantic graphs. The TCM ontology is developed by Prot X g X  [5] as RDF(S) and promoted to be Unified Traditional Chinese Medical Language System (UTCML) [1]. 2.3 Information Integration We can dynamically create Semantic Mappings between semantics of ontologies and distributed information bases. The RDF model is very directly connected with the schemata of relational databases [6] (see figure 3). Definition 2.3 ( Semantic Mapping ) The following items define a generic semantic mapping with databases: (1) (2) (3)  X   X  X  X   X   X  = pim pi pi ci i M , M , M , M M 2 1 . i M is a semantic mapping. (4) A record in i Table can be mapped to a direct instance of i Class by i M. 
By creating semantic mappings through Semantic Registration, database resources can dynamically join a virtual organization [7]. Other kinds of information bases can erogeneous information bases are dynamically integrated and we can construct an effective and intuitive semantic view [8](see figure 4) based on various services with large-scale information bases for end-users. Semantics eliminates the inconsistency of information resources and distributed in-formation bases join together as a virtual organization at Semantic Layer. However we still need a semantic-based universal and visual environment for end-users to end-users with a series of intelligent and effective interactions. 3.1 Design Principles Here we just propose several basic principles for designing and implementing such a semantic-based Web information client. Extendable Principle. As a service-based information system, the client accesses various Web services or Grid services to provide high-level operations. Hence it services without the main structure being modified. Visualization Principle. Unlike HTML contents, which are readable for human be-ing, semantic information aims at machine processing. The structure of semantic information is unsuitable for users to read di rectly. To give end-users an intuitive and universal view on semantic information, the client should provide a mechanism to visualize semantic information as semantic graphs. Limitation Principle. For large-scale knowledge systems like TCM, the correspond-ing domain ontologies are huge in most cases. However, the acceptability of end-information returned from services should be restricted to some bound. unique concept or individual in semantic information) can be related to another re-properties, there is a Weak Semantic Link between these two resources. that with too many weak semantic links. When the scale of semantic information graph will get so complex that a lot of nodes and arcs will overlap with each other in the user area of the client, so the design should think much of graph layouts. Interactive Principle. Besides visualizing semantic information, end-users need more interactions such as querying to gain useful information from distributed infor-assist them managing and sharing information. 3.2 Semantic Browser According to the principles before-mentioned, we implemented a novel semantic-based information browser, Semantic Browser (see figure 5) to resolve the problem of representing and managing large-scale information towards information-intensive field like TCM. Semantic Browser manipulates distributed information bases at Se-based interactions. Semantic Browser is a lightweight client, which accesses the Grid services [9] of DartGrid [10]. which are independent and optional functional modules in Semantic Browser. A se-mantic plugin usually contains some Grid Service stubs and remotely accesses a spe-cific category of Grid Services. Semantic Browser reserves slots for extended plugins accessing possible services in the future. This extendable plugin mechanism allows Semantic Browser to extend its functionalit ies according to the change by adding and updating new plugins, without the basic structure of system being modified. information as intuitive Semantic Graphs. A semantic graph in Semantic Browser is represented and comprised by operational vectographic components in Semantic visual graph language for semantic information, Semantic Graph Language (SGL) [3] and the radial layout algorithm is implemented inside SGL. Unlike common visual graph languages or graph exchange langua ges, SGL takes semantics into account and treats them as part of graph elements (see figure 6). Semantic Browser has the built-in support for converting various formats of semantic information into SGL. is to visualize concepts with their instances that are explicitly described and the rela-tionships among them as semantic graphs and assist users to browse semantic infor-mation through semantic links. [11] to arrange the global layout of a semantic graph by each slice of semantic infor-mation, to avoid overlapping of nodes and arcs. graphs provide end-users with a series of semantic interactions including Semantic Registration and Semantic Query in a visual environment. In Semantic Browser, end-users can interact with Grid services to retrieve semantic information through the URI rather than querying in local information bases directly.

Every query in Q3 can be viewed as an OWL class definition; and query processing is reduced as computing instances satisfying the about the name , usage , dosage and composition of a Chinese medical formula , which can attend influenza . The querying statements above can be visually con-structed based on semantic graphs and there is a direct mapping from SGL to Q3 (see table 1). ( DQI , the floating panel in figure 5) of Semantic Browser, by visual mapping during the process of Semantic Browsing. The semantic graph components in Semantic Browser offer four mapping operations,  X  X el ect X ,  X  X elect and disp lay X ,  X  X nselect X  and graph component, a corresponding Q3 item will be automatically produced or updated in the DQI . By combining a group of sequential operations, a set of Semantic Query the Semantic Query Service of DartGrid and the process of query dispatching and organization as semantic information and displayed as semantic graphs. TCM researchers and doctors, who have known basic TCM knowledge, can gain valuable information by performing interactions in the visualization environment of Semantic Browser. Considering the following scenario: a TCM doctor wants to know the compositions of some new Chinese medical formulas for cough. In this paper, we draw out the paradigm of an intelligent visual environment towards manipulating large-scale Web information and indicate a set of design principles. As an implementation to those principles, Semantic Browser dynamically constructs an interactive semantic view based on various Grid services for end-users to perform high-level interactions. In collaboration with the China Academy of Traditional Chi-nese Medicine, we have built a semantic-based information-sharing platform for TCM databases based on Semantic Browser and DartGrid, which involves tens of large databases from several institutions.
