 Power users, in a Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender Sys-tem (RS) context, are those who can exert considerable influence over the recommendation outcomes presented to other users. RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities and leverage them to help fellow users make informed purchase deci-sions. Thus, RS research in this area has focused on power user se-lection and utilization to address challenges such as rating sparsity for new items or users. But, as ever, there remains the potential for corruption by power users who provide biased ratings. And because of the influence that power users wield, biased ratings they provide can have significant impacts on RS accuracy and robustness. In or-der to better understand this problem and develop solution strate-gies, our research is investigating the impact on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists when power users provide biased rat-ings. The open areas of research we have explored are analyzing and evaluating power user selection techniques, statistically char-acterizing power users in order to create attack profiles, mounting power user attacks on new items, and using accuracy and robust-ness metrics to evaluate power user attacks. In the future, we plan to extend our initial research in power user selection, characterization, and evaluation, as well as generate attack profiles based on power user characteristics, mount power user attacks on user-based, item-based, and SVD-based CF systems, evaluate power user attacks, and generalize our work across different domains.

In a Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender System (RS) context, power users are those who can exert considerable influ-ence over the recommendations presented to other users. Previous research has indicated that power users can have major impacts on RS ratings predictions and top-N recommendations lists, especially when the underlying RS algorithms are neighborhood-based [9]. However, recommender system operators encourage the existence of power user communities; e.g., Amazon Vine TM invites the most trusted reviewers on Amazon to post opinions about new and pre-release items to help their fellow users make informed purchase decisions 1 . Furthermore, new items can sometimes pose significant market acceptance challenges to producers of goods and services; in order to address this issue, marketers may rely on the influence that power users have in recommending items to other users [3, 1]. But given the influence that power users can have over others, what happens when power users provide biased ratings?
To address this issue, we define a novel  X  X ower User Attack X  as a set of power user profiles that influence the results presented to other users by providing biased ratings. This attack is distinct from previously studied types of RS attacks [11, 8, 10] (e.g.,  X  X andom X ,  X  X verage X ,  X  X andwagon X , etc.) that rely on a set of carefully config-ured false user profiles, which are injected into the dataset to mount the attack. Power User Attack analyses rely critically on power user selection, so we use degree centrality concepts from social network analysis [16] for identifying the most influential RS power users for attack purposes and develop a novel approach for evaluating power user selection that gathers metrics before and after a power user attack.

Our progress to date (see  X 3 and  X 4) has been to analyze and evaluate power user selection techniques, characterize power users in order to create attack profiles, mount power user attacks on new items, and evaluate power user attacks. To advance this work, my dissertation proposal investigates several questions related to RS power users and attacks mounted using synthetic power users: 1.

Develop a novel power user selection evaluation approach Initial results (see  X 4) indicate that degree centrality offers signif-icant improvements over existing techniques for power user selec-tion and that power user attacks have significant accuracy and ro-bustness impacts on RS predictions and recommendations, espe-cially for new items in user-based CF systems.
In the RS context, power users are of interest to system oper-ators and their client companies when launching a new item be-cause a positive endorsement (high rating) can translate into item recommendations to a large number of users. This is known as market-based use of RS and has been previously promoted as a solution to the  X  X old-start X  or  X  X ew item X  problem [1]. However, identifying power users remains an active research topic. Rashid et al [13] developed a RS algorithm-independent approach based on the number of unique prediction differences observed when an active user is removed from the prediction calculation. Viral mar-keting, to exploit the network value of customers, was studied by [3]. Maximizing the spread of influence through a social network was further studied by [7] who found the problem to be NP-hard and provided the first provable approximate guarantees for efficient algorithms. More recently, [4] has analyzed several heuristic ap-proaches to power user selection. Power user selection techniques have been evaluated using various methods such as shifts in pre-diction values [13, 4], accuracy and coverage measures [1], and expected lift in profit [3]. Although robustness measures such as Hit Ratio and Rank (see Evaluation Metrics in  X 3.2) in the context of RS attacks have not been used previously to evaluate power user selection methods, we use them here because we believe that true power users are in some sense defined by their capacity for impact on system outcomes.

Social Network Analysis affords well-known concepts that can be readily applied to RS power users and their influence in the un-derlying RS social graph. The concept of Degree Centrality [16] indicates that nodes (users) who have more edges (connections) to other nodes may have advantages; high in-degree refers to nodes that many other nodes connect to and corresponds to high promi-nence, prestige, or popularity and high out-degree refers to nodes that connect to many other nodes and corresponds to high expan-siveness. Furthermore, collaborative relationships in recommender systems can be represented as a social network [12], where, in-degree represents the number of contact lists a user appears in and out-degree indicates the number of users on a contact list that can be used to ask opinions or advice. Neighborhood characteristics and power user selection in recommender systems were analyzed in [9] as part of a study on temporal social networks.

Attempts to influence recommender system results by provid-ing false ratings are known as  X  X hilling attacks X  [8], or  X  X rofile injection attacks X  [10]. A user profile contains the set of ratings a user has made using the recommender system. Attacks are used to either promote ( X  X ush X ) a target item by setting the rating to the maximum value or demote ( X  X uke X ) a target item by setting the rating to the minimum value; furthermore, attackers will sub-mit one or more user profiles containing item ratings (called attack user profiles) that push or nuke a specific item. Research in attacks on recommender systems began in 2002 [11] and has continued to be studied, especially in the areas of attack detection and im-provements in algorithm robustness; a more recent summary on RS attacks can be found in [2]. This research has revealed that knowl-edge of the underlying RS algorithms and dataset characteristics can enhance the effectiveness of an attack even though this knowl-edge may be difficult to obtain. With today X  X  level of user sophis-tication, however, attackers can obtain this knowledge either indi-rectly (e.g., scraping/data-mining, social engineering well-known users via side channels) or even directly (e.g., leak, insider, system breach). Uncovering, in part or full, the social network of interest that underlies such RS can leave systems vulnerable to exploitation from more subtle, yet powerful, attacks by highly-influential power users. And this vector of attack remains an open question in RS robustness research that is explored in my dissertation.
We define the Power User Attack (PUA) as a novel attack model where power users bias the results of the RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists with targeted fake ratings. Like other at-tack models, PUA profiles contain target items that are set to the maximum or minimum rating depending on attack intent. How-ever, unlike classic attack models such as random, average, and bandwagon, that employ straightforward statistical templates, e.g., average rating, popularity, and likability, to generate attack profile  X  X iller X  (non-target) items [10], very little is known about the pro-file characteristics of power users. And without this knowledge, it is difficult to generate synthetic power user profiles. So, in order to evaluate this attack model, our initial foray into studying the impact of a PUA uses selected power user profiles that already exist in the dataset as simulated injected attack user profiles; we recognize this as a limitation in our initial work and will be addressed in the future with the use of synthetic power user attack profiles.
Power users in the RS context have been referred to as users with a large number of ratings [6] as well as those that are able to influ-ence the largest number of other users [3, 13, 1, 4]. To measure in-fluence, [13] used the number of prediction differences above a pre-diction threshold when a user is removed from the dataset, [4] used the number of users that had the prediction for a target item shifted sufficiently above a threshold so that the item appears in their top-N list, [1] used MAE and coverage to evaluate various seed (influ-ential user) selection algorithms, and [3] used the expected lift in profit earned by influencing other users. Although maximizing the spread of influence through a social network is an NP-hard prob-lem to solve optimally [7], several heuristics were analyzed by [4] in order to select groups of influential users including Most Central
Described in a short paper to appear in RecSys 2013; excerpts from that paper were used in this abstract. Also, new results using ML10M and SVD are provided in  X 4.1 of this abstract. (those with highest aggregate similarity to other users), Most Pos-itive (those with the highest positive average rating), Most Active (those who have rated the highest number of items), and Random (a control group comprised of randomly selected users).

We have developed an approach to power user selection for at-tack purposes called InDegree , based on social network analysis concepts of Degree Centrality [16, 9]. Specifically, we use In-Degree Centrality (users who appear in the highest number of other users X  neighborhoods) with significance weighting [5]; in an initial study, we found that both our approach and the Most Central heuristic [4] performed significantly better selecting power users when us-ing significance weighting. Our selection process is such that for each user i we compute its similarity with every other user j ap-plying significance weighting n ci / 50 , then discard all but the top-n neighbors for each user i (we used n=25 for ID2550 and n=50 for ID5050), count the number of similarity scores for each user j (# neighborhoods user j is in), and select the top k users. Other approaches were implemented for comparative purposes: Aggregated Similarity (AS25NO): This is the Most Central heuris-tic from [4] that selects the top users with the highest aggregate similarity scores; this method requires at least 5 co-rated items be-tween user i and user j and does not use significance weighting Number of Ratings (NR): This method, based on power user defi-nition in [6] and Most Active heuristic in [4], selects the top users based on the total number of ratings they have in their user profile.
Our initial analyses for power user selection, characterization, and power user attack on new items use the following setup: Datasets and Algorithms : We used MovieLens 4 ML100K 5 , ML1M and ML10M 7 datasets. Following earlier studies evaluating power user influence [3, 13, 4], we use traditional CF algorithms. For the user-based CF algorithm [14, 5], we used Pearson Correlation sim-ilarity with significance weighting, neighborhood formation, and mean-centered prediction. For the item-based CF algorithm [15], we used Adjusted Cosine similarity, neighborhood formation, and weighted prediction. We also use SVD with 50 features and 50 it-erations for the power user selection analysis (see  X 4.1). Attack-related Target Item Selection : For each dataset, fifty target items were selected randomly from a set of items with no more than one rating, because our initial intent was to attack only  X  X ew X  items. Attack Parameter Selection : The Attack Intent used is Push, i.e., target item rating is set to max (= 5). The Attack Size or number of power users in each attack varies from 2 to 50, where 50 power user profiles equate to a 5% attack for ML100K and a 1% attack for ML1M; ML10M was not used for attack analysis. The attack profiles used were actual power user profiles with the target item rating inserted 8 ; the filler size is determined by each power users X  profile size.
 Evaluation Metrics : We use Mean Absolute Error and prediction coverage [6] for accuracy and coverage using a holdout-partitioned 70/30 train/test dataset, and Hit Ratio, Prediction Shift, and Rank robustness measures [10, 2] where high Hit Ratio and low Rank indicate that the attack was successful (from attacker X  X  perspective).
Based on personal communication with the authors. http://www.grouplens.org nominal 100,000 ratings, 1,682 movies, and 943 users. nominal 1,000,209 ratings, 3,883 movies, 6,040 users. nominal 10,000,054 ratings, 10,676 movies, 69,878 users.
In a few cases, power user profiles that already had a target item rating were updated in certain attack scenarios and, although the target item rating change might alter their neighborhoods, we be-lieve the impact to this initial analysis is not an overriding issue.
Our approach to evaluating selection of power users and their in-fluence is to use accuracy metrics (before the attack) and robustness metrics (after the attack). Before the attack , the measure of influ-ence is the negative impact on RS accuracy when removing power users. Prior to attack, we incrementally removed power users from the datasets for each method of power user selection. The results for ML10M 9 (Figure 1) show that as power users are removed, MAE is negatively impacted in all CF algorithms tested; this is also the case for ML100K and ML1M (not shown) and these results are con-sistent with those observed in [9]. Compared to a baseline where no power users are removed, InDegree selection impacts MAE by an average high of 2.2% across all three CF algorithms, Number of Ratings by 1.8%, and Aggregated Similarity by 0.5%; all these impacts were significant ( p &lt; 0.02). InDegree selection, compared to the other methods, has a higher MAE impact in User-based CF. Both InDegree and Number of Ratings methods are better at select-ing power users than Aggregated Similarity, i.e., they have the most significant impacts on MAE with removal of fewer power users, es-pecially in SVD-based and User-based CF. The Number of Ratings method performs relatively well across all CF algorithms and begs the question of whether having a large number of ratings is really the only requirement to become a power user. After the attack , the most influential set of power users is the one producing the highest Hit Ratio and lowest Rank (see results in  X 4.3).

Figure 1: ML10M MAE impacts after removing Power Users
In order to understand the differences between power and non-power user groups within a given dataset, identified using InDe-gree, we have collected various statistical measures for each group across ML100K, ML1M, and ML10M. Notably for InDegree across these datasets, a statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.02) pattern is emerg-ing: power users have a lower average rating, higher average num-ber of ratings, higher average number of co-rated items, and higher rating entropy when compared to the non-power user group and the entire dataset of users. Although the absolute number for each measure varies according to the dataset, the pattern is consistent.
Accuracy and robustness metrics (Figures 2 and 3) were neg-atively impacted due to the PUA. Although accuracy results var-ied, all of the selection methods yielded MAE values significantly
We selected 3500 power users or about 5% of all ML10M users. higher ( p &lt; 0.05) for ML1M User-based CF and 30 or more power users, and the InDegree selection method yielded MAE values sig-nificantly higher ( p &lt; 0.05) for ML1M Item-based CF with 30 or 40 power users. Robustness results indicate that InDegree and Num-ber of Ratings impact User-based CF recommenders more signifi-cantly than Aggregated Similarity; however, we found the reverse to be true for Item-based CF recommenders. For User-based CF, InDegree performed better than Number of Ratings on the ML1M dataset (p &lt; 0.05) as indicated by Hit Ratio and Rank results; InDe-gree and Number of Ratings were about the same for ML100K (not shown). Impacts to robustness metrics indicate that a small number of power users 10 can have significant effects on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists for new items; User-based CF is signif-icantly more vulnerable to this power user attack than Item-based CF and is consistent with previous findings [8, 10, 2].

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first definition, analy-sis, and evaluation of the PUA and its impacts on RS. Addressing this problem will allow us to understand the vulnerability of col-laborative RSs to manipulation by power users as well as to enable development of attack detection and mitigation methods. Our initial analysis indicates that power users identified using social network degree centrality can have significant effects on accuracy and ro-bustness measures and that the PUA can mount effective attacks
