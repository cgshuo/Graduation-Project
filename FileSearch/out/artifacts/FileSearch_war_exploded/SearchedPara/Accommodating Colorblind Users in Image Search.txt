 There are about 8% of men and 0.8% of women suffering from colorblindness. Due to certain loss of color informa-tion, the existing image search techniques may not provide satisfactory results for these users. In this demonstration, we show an image search system that can accommodate col-orblind users. It can help these special users find and enjoy what they want by providing multiple services for them, in-cluding search results reranking, image recoloring and color indication.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Retrieval Models Algorithms, Experimentation Image Search, Colorblindness
The last decade has witnessed great advance of image search techniques. But the existing popular image search websites, such as Google/Yahoo/Microsoft image search, all aim to serve normal viewers and focus on returning more relevant results with the users X  queries. Special groups, such as colorblind users, have not been taken into consideration. However, good search results for a normal viewer may not be acceptable for colorblind users, since several images will not be well perceived by them due to certain loss of color information.

Several research efforts have been dedicated to helping colorblind users better perceive and enjoy images. How-ever, up to now there is no image search engine that can accommodate colorblind users against their deficiency. This demonstration introduces such a system that can accom-modate colorblind users in several aspects. Specifically, the system provides three services for colorblind users: (1) Accessibility-based reranking. It can analyze the col-orblind accessibilities of search results (i.e., the image qual-
