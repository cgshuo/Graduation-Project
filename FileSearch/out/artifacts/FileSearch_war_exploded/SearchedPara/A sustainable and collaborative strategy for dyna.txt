 1. Introduction
Recently, wireless services market has witnessed a paradigm shift with the development of multiple complementary wireless technologies to cater to the various needs of customers. As a result, service providers (SPs) have started offering numerous services on these multiple technologies in the same service area. Example of one such SP is S K Telecom  X  the largest operator in South Korea with more than 50% market share ( Hong, 2010 ); it has several technologies, such as CDMA, 3G CDMA (i.e. EV-DO), 3.5G (HSDPA),
WiBro and LTE. A similar case in point is BSNL in India ( http:// www.bsnl.co.in ), which is deploying 3G in addition to its existing 2G service (GSM and CDMA). Also, with the roll out of LTE technology, major SPs around the world, such as DOCOMO in
Japan, AT&amp;T Wireless in U.S., and China Mobile in China, will be managing at least three access networks (ANs) of different tech-nologies (namely GSM, WCDMA and LTE) in the same service area. to support these technologies in the current spectrum-scarce environment. Under current static spectrum allocation policy, the allocated frequency band is ear-marked for a particular technology (say A) and cannot be used for another (say B) even if the capacity of technology B is exhausted. For instance, in India, where 3G services are being offered recently, many of the existing 2G customers, having already purchased 3G-capable handsets, are now choosing 3G services, resulting in shift in demand from 2G to 3G. Naturally, Indian SPs, if allowed, will prefer to use the 2G spectrum intelligently to provide service to the increasing num-ber of 3G customers. Contrary to the above, if SPs experience under-utilization of 3G spectrum due to lack of demand of 3G services in some areas, they may prefer to use their allocated 3G spectrum for their existing 2G customers to provide them much better quality of experience (QoE). Though, at present, this kind of spectrum reuse is not permitted in many countries, such as India, soon this hypothesis would evolve as a reality when SPs will have more and more technologies in their portfolio. This phenomenon calls for some judicious, dynamic and adaptive spectrum alloca-tion strategies to be adopted by the SPs. 1.1. Centralized dynamic spectrum allocation spectrum allocation approaches in the literature ( Song et al., 2012 ;
Zhao and Sadler, 2007 ). In those approaches, a central body (or more precisely a central agency) maintains a spectrum pool and subse-quently, allocates spectrum to the SPs as per their demand for a short duration. An SP, on the other hand, distributes spectrum to its multiple ANs of different access technologies. In order to make the dynamic spectrum allocation approach feasible, some adaptations need to be made in both technology plane and control plane of the network. In the technology plane, radio nodes need to be reconfi-gured in different spectrum regions. The challenges of the techno-logical plane are discussed by Akyildiz et al. (2008) . In this case, radio nodes will be able to use any frequency in a wide band (300z X  3 GHz) depending upon the availability. Responsibility of distribu-tion of available spectrum lies with the control plane which actually consists of an inference engine. Our present work focuses on the control plane and aims to devise a strategy to facilitate fair distribution of spectrum among the spectrum users as per their demands.

SPs ( Fig. 1 ) and a centralized spectrum controller (CSC), main-tained by the spectrum regulatory authority of the respective country ( Buddhikot et al., 2005 ). We have used term spectrum controller instead of spectrum broker used by Buddhikot et al. (2005) as our entity possesses more control over the distribution of spectrum rather than being a facilitator of spectrum distribu-tion. CSC owns a spectrum pool and is also responsible for managing, controlling and distributing spectrum among different
SPs. Further, every SP may own a heterogeneous network con-sisting of n different ANs and n may vary from SP to SP. A local spectrum controller (LSC) is dedicated to that SP. Functionality of
LSC is similar to that of CSC, except that it is responsible for taking decision regarding distribution of spectrum among ANs of the same SP. This proposition results in a two-level hierarchy ( Fig. 1 ) consisting of a supervisory control architecture with information flowing through the interfaces between the layers. This structure can easily be mapped as game( s ) (either competitive or coopera-tive). At the higher level of abstraction, CSC is in control of the game and SPs (being the players) place their bids to CSC, generally in a non-cooperative environment. Depending on the spectrum allocation policy, SPs, in turn, receive spectrum (may or may not be adequate), which, in turn, is controlled by the LSC associated with an SP. In response to the demands placed by ANs under a single SP, LSC now plays the game with its ANs (the players down the level of abstraction). 1.2. Game theoretic approach
Let us assume that an SP receives bids from different ANs and, in turn, submits its own estimated bid (derived from aggregate bids of ANs) to the CSC. It is apparent that by the law of nature (to be the fittest one), the SPs will vie with each other for the spectrum. Consequently, at the first stage, CSC distributes the available spectrum to m SPs in a competitive environment. We have conceived this as m -player non-cooperative game. At the second stage, LSC of SP distributes the received spectrum amongst its n ANs. If ANs compete with each other to acquire the spectrum, more amount of spectrum will go to the ANs that make higher bids. Consequently, ANs such as GSM that usually garner less amount of revenue would suffer because of their lower bids compared to the new cutting edge technologies such as UMTS and LTE. Thus, quality of service (QoS) guaranteed by the old yet well-pervasive AN of GSM may get adversely affected. As a result, the acceptance of an incumbent AN to the customers may drastically fall in this competitive and hostile ambience. Hence, to accommodate new ANs as well, an environment of collaboration amongst all ANs is always desirable. This leads us to envisage an n -player cooperative game ( Saad et al., 2009 )foreachof m SPs.

Since outcomes of cooperative game at the second stage are dependent on the outcomes of non-cooperative game at the first stage, we have conceived the whole spectrum allocation problem as a macrogame, which is a combination of several microgames. Hypothetically, the microgames are, to some extent, interleaved and this fact leads us to a game-within-game kind of problem. However, in real life, only after the allocation of spectrum to the SPs by the CSC, could the LSC start the game where the ANs are the players. Also, it is apparent that the game (in the second level of abstraction) is to be played every now or then in contrast to the first-level-game (as the spectrum is chartered to the SPs for an appreciable period of time on lease basis). Based on these assumptions, in this work, we have tried to capture the more critical scenario of dynamic spectrum allocation by an SP to its ANs. This consideration results in an n -player cooperative micro-game, the study of which would result in a strategic approach for dynamic spectrum allocation policy to be adopted by an indivi-dual SP. On the basis of this premise, henceforth our discussion will be restricted to a single SP (as other SPs having similar types of ANs would follow the same strategy for effectual spectrum allocation) solution. Now, for the sake of clarity, we reiterate our considerations, which are as follows. For a single SP case, LSC is the only spectrum controller/distributor and ANs under the SP are the only players. Hence, the challenge of the LSC is to distribute the available spectrum to different ANs in a fair way so as to maximize the collective performance levels of all the ANs under its control. 1.3. Our contribution
The novelty of the present work is to shape the dynamic spectrum allocation problem in the mould of an n -player coop-erative bankruptcy game ( Curiel et al., 1987 ; Driessen, 1995 ). To establish the rationale behind the cooperation, at the very begin-ning, we have investigated whether the ANs find it beneficial to collaborate with each other or not. For this, the concept of core ( Ferguson, 2008 ) is used to prove that there exist possibilities of stable or sustainable coalition among ANs in the case of spectrum distribution. Next, the bankruptcy game has been solved to find out the most efficient spectrum allocation solution that would satisfy the objectives of an LSC or SP. In the context of the present work, the most probable objectives an LSC could have are: i. Minimizing overall dissatisfaction (MOD) of the heterogeneous network: Dissatisfaction is defined as the difference between the benefit of the bid amount of spectrum and the benefit received by the AN from the spectrum allocation. Assessment of dissatisfaction is important because it indicates the lost opportunity of the AN. In this approach, spectrum is allocated in a manner such that aggregate dissatisfaction of the heterogeneous network is minimized. ii. Maintaining equality of distribution (MED): Here, spectrum is distributed in a manner such that all ANs draw equal benefit from the spectrum allocated to each of them. This concept is also known as  X  X  Local equity  X  X  ( Boarini et al., 2009 ) in the context of resource distribution.

Next, we attempt to devise an appropriate utility function for different ANs. Here, we define utility function to be the quantified measure of benefit that an AN gains from the spectrum allocated to it. As per our consideration, one AN, under one SP can bid for any spectrum bandwidth. However, there may be a discrepancy between the bid amount and the received spectrum. It is apparent that this disparity would be reflected implicitly in the benefits gained by each and every AN. Consequently, the utility function would give us the impression about the efficacy of spectrum allocation strategy. To arrive at the specific spectrum allocation solution value, two solution concepts, viz. Shapley value ( Niyato and Hossain, 2006 ; Ferguson, 2008 ) and t -value ( Driessen and
Tijs, 1985 ), are applied to the problem. Max X  X in fairness solution ( Keshav, 1997 ) of the problem has been benchmarked to evaluate the performances of the above mentioned techniques. To exem-plify the work, we have taken into account a toy, heterogeneous network architecture, consisting of three ANs of different wireless technologies. And finally, we have proposed a dynamically adap-tive spectrum allocation strategy for making efficient spectrum allocation decision, which leads to its commercial acceptability.
To the best of our knowledge, this kind of integrated study of dynamic spectrum allocation and proposition of an adaptive dynamic resource allocation strategy in a cooperative environ-ment have not been cited in literature. In this respect, the present work is unique in its kind.

The paper is organized as follows. A brief background of cooperative game theory and literature survey are presented in Section 2 .In Section 3 , the problem formulation is presented.
Section 4 is devoted to the solution methodology. The simulation results have been provided in the Section 5 . Section 6 concludes the work. 2. Background of the work 2.1. Related works
Majority of works related to dynamic spectrum allocation approach concentrate on spectrum allocation to competing spec-trum users (i.e. SPs) in a non-cooperative scenario. A real time spectrum auction framework for the spectrum allocation problem is presented for maximizing the revenue using pair-wise inter-ference model ( Gandhi et al., 2007 ). Sengupta and Chatterjee (2009) have considered a scenario where spectrum broker dis-tributes spectrum among different competing SPs. Knapsack based auction model has been considered for dynamically allo-cating spectrum to different SPs so that revenue of spectrum broker and average spectrum usage are maximized. Kiran and
Giaffreda (2011) have proposed architecture where, the network provider, who owns the spectrum in a particular area, shares its spectrum resources with different SPs in a competitive way. They have presented a reinforced learning based dynamic pricing mechanism in an auction framework for trading of spectrum resources in order to maximize the profit of the network provider.
However, our problem of single SP having multiple ANs has not been dealt in the above papers, though authors ( Subramanian et al., 2008 ) have considered the problem of single SP in one of their works. Here, authors have considered a network architec-ture where, spectrum broker dynamically allocates frequencies from its spectrum pool to multiple base stations. A dynamic auction based approach has been used to allocate spectrum to competing base stations in order to maximize the revenue earned, considering the constraint of the wireless interference in the network. Al-Ayyoub et al. (2010) have considered the problem of dynamic spectrum configuration in a set of base stations through
Self-management (Self-X) technologies in case of LTE/WiMAX network. Objective of their work is to configure the set of base stations such that it maximizes the overall spectrum efficiency of the network considering the interference constraints. However, we argue that ANs belonging to the same SP have enough reasons to cooperate rather than to compete. Hence, we have not considered the spectrum efficiency or revenue maximizing objec-tive of SP. Similar scenario as ours can be found ( Leaves et al., 2004 ), where spectrum is dynamically allotted to two different
ANs of different technologies, namely UMTS and DVB-T to improve overall spectrum efficiency of the heterogeneous net-work of the SP. An optimization algorithm has been proposed by the authors for making the allocation decision. The problem of spectrum sharing between two ANs of different technologies belonging to same SP has been addressed by Ghamari et al. (2011) . Here, authors have taken an optimization approach by designing a novel heuristic to avoid overload of ANs as far as possible and to manage the overload in case it cannot be avoided.
Salameh et al. (2010) have proposed an algorithm that fairly allocates resources to multiple cognitive radio (CR) users in order to maximize the overall throughput of CR network. The authors have assumed a scenario where, cumulative demand of resources is less than the available resources. Therefore, their algorithm fails to capture our scenario in which, the available spectrum to LSC is less than the cumulative demand for spectrum resources. Bigdeli and Abolhassani (2012) have also suggested a heuristic that maximizes the overall throughput of a CR network. Their optimi-zation scheme is also applicable to the scenario where, available spectrum is insufficient to cater demands of all CR users. How-ever, they have not considered inherent selfish nature of CR users.
On the contrary, we have considered the selfish nature of the ANs through our game theoretic approach. Hence, it may be inap-propriate to compare the performances of our solution techniques with that of the authors as their problem domain is also different from ours. The problem of fair allocation of spectrum for efficient spectrum utilization in wireless networks is considered by Pan et al. (2009) . Here, authors have proposed Shapley value based profit allocation mechanism to distribute profits among the bidding nodes. We have considered spectrum allocation problem of an SP in a cooperative environment in our previous works ( Paul et al., 2011a , 2011b ). The spectrum distribution problem has been modeled as a bankruptcy game and has been solved with the help of nucleolus solution ( Paul et al., 2011a ). MED is considered as a possible objective of LSC. In the next work ( Paul et al., 2011b ), we have extended our previous work and applied Shapley value solution to the problem. It has been found that Shapley value solution outperforms nucleolus solution. However, sustainability aspect of Shapley value solution has not been examined in the paper. Therefore, in present work, we have combined our pre-vious works and in addition, we have also studied performance of another solution concept namely, t -value. Stability of each solu-tion has been examined. Moreover, we have defined another possible objective of LSC namely, MOD. Therefore, it can be inferred from the above literature survey that: a. The spectrum allocation problem of an SP has not been studied b. No attempt has been made to define a possible objective 2.2. Cooperative game theory introduction to cooperative game or coalition game theory that analyzes the behavioral pattern of rational players should they choose to cooperate with each other ( Saad et al., 2009 ). In our context, ANs are the players in the game. The motivation behind the formation of cooperating groups of ANs, also referred to as coalitions strengthened in the process. Let A  X  { AN 1 , AN 2 , y , AN
ANs of SP who seek to form cooperative groups in the cooperative game. ANs belonging to coalition H D A have an agreement among them to act as a single entity. Set A is called grand coalition that denotes coalition of all ANs. For example, in case of three ANs, feasible coalitions could be a single AN, any feasible combination of two ANs at a time and at most all three ANs at a time. In set theoretic notation, H could be any of the followings: { AN { AN 3 }, { AN 1 , AN 2 }, { AN 2 , AN 3 }, { AN 1 , AN 3 Another important concept of a cooperative game is the coalition value . Mathematically, this coalition value is represented as j ( H ), often referred to as the character istic function of the coalition H . Here j ( H ) is a real valued function that denotes the worth of coalition for every H inthegame( Ferguson, 2008 ). If AN 1 collectively receive a spectrum amount (also referred to as payoff) of ^ g unit by cooperating, the value of the coalition { AN 1 represented by j ({ AN 1 , AN 2 })  X  ^ g. Similarly, if AN receives payoff of ^ h unit, the value of { AN 1 }isrepresentedby j ({ AN 1 })  X  ^ h. A cooperative game is uniquely defined by the pair ( A , j )( Ferguson, 2008 ).

Imputation is defined to be the spectrum allocation vector or payoff vector z  X  ( z 1 , z 2 , y , z n )where AN i receives payoff z grand coalition ( Ferguson, 2008 ). The payoff z i must be at least equal to or greater than the payoff AN i would have received grand coalition compared to playing individually. Further, in case of imputation, the total payoff of grand coalition must be fully distributed to all ANs. Several imputations may exist in a coopera-tive game. However, in case of imputation, the possibility of formation of coalitions other than grand coalition is not considered. Consider a game of three ANs, where, j ({ AN 1 })  X   X  a and AN payoff ^ c while in the grand coalition while AN 1 receives payoff  X  e when it forms coalition with AN 2 . Now let us assume a scenario it is imperative that the corresponding imputation will not be stable as AN 1 will choose to form coalition with AN 2 instead of staying in grand coalition. In this context, core is defined as the set of stable imputations where, ANs cannot get better payoff by forming coalitions other than grand coalition Table 1 . 2.3. Bankruptcy game
The bankruptcy problem arises at the time of distribution of a limited resource among its claimants while worth of the resource is insufficient enough to meet the claims of the claimants on that resource. The spectrum distribut ion problem of SP among its ANs is similar to bankruptcy problem and the mapping is shown in Table 2 . 3. Problem formulation
Let A  X  { AN 1 , AN 2 , y , AN n } be the set of n number of ANs under the SP. Throughout the formulation we have used the index i to take the values within range [1, n ]. Nevertheless, in our work, we have presumed that SP acquires K amount of spectrum from CSC. Now, SP has the task of distributing the spectrum among its n ANs. Each AN i needs threshold amount spectrum b th i to be operational. As for example, if AN i is using LTE TDD technology, then it needs minimum 1.4 MHz bandwidth to be operational ( Osseiran et al., 2009 ). Any bandwidth less than 1.4 MHz will not serve any purpose for the LTE network. Therefore, value of b be 1.4 MHz. We envisage a scenario where, spectrum available to LSC is insufficient to cater spectrum demands of its ANs. However, adequate spectrum is available to guarantee corresponding threshold amount of spectrum to each ANs. Hence, X
In this scenario, main challenge of LSC is to fairly distribute the spectrum available after meeting the threshold spectrum amount of each AN.
 where, x 1 be the amount of spectrum allocated to AN 1 , x amount of spectrum allocated to AN n . x must satisfy the following conditions: b r x i r b i  X  2  X 
Eq. (2) represents that AN i needs minimum b th i amount of spectrum. On the other hand, AN i can get maximum b i amount of spectrum i.e. the amount of spectrum it bids from LSC. Eq. (3) indicates that the aggregate of distributed spectrum should not be greater than the spectrum available to LSC. So, the objective of the present work boils down to finding out of a spectrum allocation vector x such that i. Spectrum allocation is sustainable in case all ANs find it beneficial to cooperate. ii. Spectrum is distributed among the ANs in a fair way so as to maximize the slated objectives of the LSC. 3.1. Sustainability of spectrum allocation solution
In this section, we investigate the existence of equilibrium amongst n collaborating ANs. The equilibrium ensures the exis-tence of a sustainable spectrum allocation solution. Let H the coalition among ANs. In case of bankruptcy game, the value of coalition H , j ( H ), can be expressed as the amount (spectrum) that is not claimed by players (ANs) who are not part of coalition H (i.e. complement of H )( Driessen, 1995 ). f  X  H  X  X  max 0 , K Now, we try to find out spectrum allocation vectors where all
ANs find it beneficial to cooperate. Here, we bring in the concept of imputation z  X  ( z 1 , z 2 , y , z n ), where, AN i receives z spectrum while all ANs are cooperating i.e. are in grand coalition.
Hence, z may be said to be a special type of spectrum allocation vector x having some specific properties. An imputation z is said to be unstable through coalition H when the aggregate of the payoffs (sum of allocated spectrum to each AN) of the ANs in the coalition H is less than the value of the coalition H i.e.
X z o j  X  H  X  X  5  X 
In this case, the ANs will go for better payoffs by forming coalition H by leaving the grand coalition A . This makes the grand coalition unstable or unsustainable. Nevertheless, our objective is to find out the imputations that are stable or sustainable through grand coalition. To put it in a different way, we want to find out the imputations that are not unstable through any coalition H
In this context, concept of core is relevant. The core is the set of imputations or spectrum allocation vectors that ensure no group of ANs have any incentive to leave the grand coalition to form another coalition H C A . The core may be empty in several cases i.e. grand coalition cannot be made stable. In general, determina-tion of non-emptiness of the core of a coalition game is NP-hard ( Conitzer and Sanholm, 2002) ).
 Lemma 1. Core always exists in case of bankruptcy game.
Proof. Convexity of a game is a sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of the core ( Aram. et al., 2009 ). It can be proved that all bankruptcy games are convex games (Curiel, 1987). Thus, we can conclude that the core surely exists in case of our problem. 3.2. Objective of LSC
We have considered two probable objectives of LSC as dis-cussed below: i. Minimizing overall dissatisfaction (MOD): In this case, we propose dissatisfaction index Z as the objective function. Z ii. Maintaining equality of distribution (MED): we have employed g  X   X  allocation of utility, the value of g tends to 0, whereas, equal utility allocation makes value of the g equal to 1.
 Maximize O where , techniques with respect to the above objectives of LSC under above constraints in order to find out an efficient spectrum management strategy for the LSC or SP. 4. Solution methodology 4.1. Utility design
The total cost incurred by AN i for rolling out a wireless service has two major components namely, cost of base station equip-ments p i and cost of spectrum q i . It is obvious that q tional to the amount of spectrum x i allocated to AN i . Apparently, base station equipment cost, p i seems to be the non-recurring part of the cost in case of dynamic spectrum allocation. However in practice, AN i tries to rationalize its total cost by an optimal mix of p and q i . For example, if cost of spectrum is too high, then AN may choose to procure more number of base stations to attain a certain network capacity. On the other hand, AN i may try to acquire more amount of spectrum to save base station equipment cost if base station cost is prohibitive. These two independent inputs produce user traffic which is measured in terms of traffic (Erlang) per MHz. Henceforth, we refer this as spectrum efficiency eff , which is assumed to have a positive correlation with the revenue of the AN. Cobb X  X ouglas functional form of production function ( Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, 2011 ) may be used to describe the relation of the output (efficiency) to the inputs (base station cost and spectrum cost) as presented below: ef f
In the above equation, eff i is the efficiency of AN i when it receives x i amount of spectrum and m i be the productivity factor. and d i represents responsiveness of eff i to the change of p q , respectively. For example, a i  X  0.15 indicates 0.15% increase of eff i with 1% increase of p i , with all other parameters held constant. Since increasing the number of base station is a long term process, this is not considered here. Hence in the rest of the work, p considered to be constant. Therefore, eff i may be expressed as: ef f
A study has been conducted to calculate the value of d in case of GSM network of matured SPs operating in different cities of India ( Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, 2011 ). The study has found that the value of d i remains more than 1 in most of the cases. This indicates that marginal change in efficiency is greater than the marginal change in cost of spectrum as: D ( eff i when d i 4 1. This nature may be attributed to the factors such as decreased interference level, more trunking efficiency and lower reuse factor due to more availability of spectrum. Though the study has been carried out for GSM network only, yet it may be applied to other wireless technologies as well. This is due to the fact that the factors responsible for increase of efficiency such as decreased interference, more trunking efficiency etc. are also applicable in case of other wireless access technologies such as LTE, WiMAX. Hence, it may be assumed that the efficiency pattern will be same across technologies. eff i varies due to different q different ANs. Thus, to compare different efficiency ranges of ANs, we have designed utility function as follows: u  X 
In the above equation, eff mini indicates the efficiency of AN it receives the threshold amount of spectrum, whereas, eff efficiency achieved when AN i receives b i amount of spectrum. Also, utility values resides within interval [0 1]. Now, with the help of Eq. (13) , the above equation may be represented as: u  X   X  x i = b i  X 
We have replaced q i by x i in Eq. (13) to derive the above utility value becomes 0 when AN i receives threshold amount of spectrum, whereas, it becomes 1 when AN i receives its entire bid amount of spectrum b i . Now, we present three different solution concepts (or solution techniques) namely, Shapley value, t -value and max X  X in fairness solution employed in this work. 4.2. Shapley value
Shapley value is a popular solution concept in cooperative game theory for finding out solution to bankruptcy problem. Shapley has defined value function x ( Ferguson, 2008 ) that maps the characteristic function j of the game to a unique spectrum allocation vector x ( j )  X  ( x 1 ( j ), x 2 ( j ), y , x the allocated spectrum amount to AN i and it represents the contribution of AN i in the overall game. The spectrum allocation vector is called Shapley value, which is unique and most prefer-able vector. Shapley value possesses some desirable properties as indicated below: i. Efficiency: This implies that the entire spectrum be distrib-ii. Symmetry: If AN i and AN j are such that j  X  H [f AN i iii. Dummy: If AN i is such that j  X  H  X  X  j  X  H [f AN i g X  for every iv. Additivity: If j and o are characteristics functions, then
Shapley value can be obtained by calculating x i ( j ) with the help of the following formula ( Saad et al., 2009 ): x j  X 
Here, x i ( j ) denotes the average contribution of AN i to the grand coalition if the ANs sequentially enter the coalition in completely random manner. Flow chart for calculating Shapley value for AN 1 for 3-AN game is presented in Fig. 2 . Next, we investigate the stability of the solution offered by Shapley value. Lemma 2. Shapley value offers a stable spectrum distribution solution.
 Proof. For convex games, Shapley value lies in the core ( Ferguson, 2008 ). As bankruptcy game is a convex game (Curiel, 1987), Shapley value resides in the core. 4.3. t -Value t -value is another well known solution concept for solving a cooperative game. In this case, concepts of utopia payoff vector and minimum payoff vector have been introduced. Utopia payoff vector is a vector whose coordinates are marginal contributions of each AN to the grand coalition. Marginal contribution of AN to the difference between the value of grand coalition and the value of coalition of all ANs except AN i . Utopia payoff L regarded as the maximum payoff that AN i can expect to obtain. Minimum payoff l i ( j ) is the payoff that AN i can guarantee itself after offering respective utopia payoffs to rest of the ANs of the coalition. t -value is a unique point in the line segment between utopia payoff and minimum payoff and t -value is denoted by:  X  l  X  p  X  L i l i  X  where , p A  X  0 , 1 8 i  X  17  X 
We have described the process of calculating t -value for 3-AN game with the help of a flow chart in Fig. 3 .
 Lemma 3. t -value of our problem offers a stable solution.
Proof. It can be proved that t -value is an element of core in case of convex games of up to 4-players ( Driessen and Tijs, 1985 ). We reiterate, since bankruptcy game is also a convex game, t -value resides in the core. 4.4. Max X  X in fairness
In case of max X  X in fairness, resources are allocated to ANs in order of increasing demands. No AN receives more than its bid amount. ANs with the demands are sorted in ascending manner. Initially, the threshold amount of spectrum of each AN is met.
Correspondingly, effective bid of each AN is calculated by deduct-ing the threshold amount of spectrum from the bid amount. Next, the available spectrum is divided equally among the ANs with unmet demands. If the divided amount is more than the effective bid amount of the least effective bid, then the effective bid amount is allocated to that AN. If the divided amount is less than or equal to the least effective bid, the divided amount is allocated to each AN. Now, the available amount of spectrum is calculated.
If any amount of spectrum is available for distribution, then the above steps are repeated until the total spectrum is distributed among ANs. We have presented the algorithm for max X  X in fairness in Fig. 4 . 5. Simulation results
In order to evaluate the performances of different solution techniques, we have implemented different techniques in MATLAB and run the simulation in a PC environment. As a test case, we have considered 3 ANs of different technologies having different utility characteristics namely A, B and C. We have set values of the parameters as indicated in Table 3 . In our framework, the threshold amount of spectrum is allocated to every AN at the initial stage. Consecutively, the bid amount of each AN is reduced by their respective threshold amount. We refer this reduced bid amount as effective bid of ANs. Let available spectrum to LSC be 40 MHz. In this case, the distributable amount of spectrum (after guaranteeing the threshold amount) will be 22 MHz (in our example, (40-5-10-3)  X  22 MHz). Next, we perform our simulation based on these above data. We have employed dissatisfaction index ( Z ) and Jain X  X  fairness index ( g ) as performance measures for objectives MOD and MED respectively.

Let x A , x B and x C be the spectrum received by ANs A, B and C respectively. Next, we calculate values of all possible coalitions of the cooperative game as follows (from Eq. (4) ): j (A)  X  0 j (AB)  X  15 j (B)  X  0 j (AC)  X  7 j (ABC)  X  22 j (C)  X  0 j (BC)  X  2
From the above coalition values, it can be inferred that imputations must satisfy the following equations: 0 r x A r 20  X  18  X  0 r x B r 15  X  19  X  0 r x C r 7  X  20  X  x  X  x B  X  x C  X  22  X  21  X 
As characteristic function (or value) of each individual coali-tion of ANs (i.e. j (A)/ j (B)/ j (C)) are 0, each AN may be allocated any amount of spectrum in between 0 and its effective bid amount. Further, Eq. (21) indicates that the entire available spectrum of LSC must be distributed among all ANs. The set of the solutions can be represented graphically by barycentric coordinates as shown in Fig. 5 . Within this representation, the plane of the plot is denoted by x A  X  x B  X  x C  X  j ( ABC ) figure, triangle P ! Q ! R ! indicates all possible combination of spectrum allocation solutions where available spectrum is fully distributed. It may be noted that all points on the triangle signify payoffs of ANs in addition to their respective threshold spectrum amount. For example, point (15,0,7) denotes the final payoff (20,10,10). Vertices of the triangle represent characteristic func-tion to each AN, individually. For example, in vertex P 0 , character-istic function of C (i.e. j ({ C })  X  0) has been allocated. Throughout the edge P 0 Q 0 , C is being allocated its characteristic function and summation of spectrum amount allocated to A and B remains constant (i.e. 22). In vertex P 0 , A is allocated 22 MHz, whereas, same amount of spectrum is allocated to B in case of vertex Q 0 .In the path from P 0 to Q 0 along the edge P 0 Q 0 , the spectrum amount allocated to A is being decreased; meanwhile, amount of spec-trum allocated to B is increased such that the total allocation to A and B remains unchanged. Within D P 0 Q 0 R 0 , there are some solu-tions that allocate more amount of spectrum to ANs than their effective bid amount. Since these are not feasible solutions, we have indicated them by shaded area. For example, all the solution points within triangle S 0 W 0 R 0 allocates more than 7 MHz (its effective bid amount: (10-3)  X  7) to C. Thus we have not con-sidered these points as valid solutions. Similar logic applies to D V 0 Q 0 W 0 allocate more than 20 MHz and 15 MHz to A and B respectively. Hence we have discarded these solutions as well. Therefore, the set of imputations are indicated by pentagon stable. In other words, we investigate the existence of core. Imputations are regarded as stable if they satisfy the following constraints: x  X  x B Z 15  X  22  X  x  X  x C Z 7  X  23  X  x  X  x C Z 2  X  24  X 
Eqs. (22 X 24) indicate that AN must not get better payoff if they form any coalition other than grand coalition. We have indicated these linear constraints in Fig. 5 . It can be seen that all imputa-tions are found to be stable in this case. This is because, these above constrains are coincided with the constraint of maximum effective bid amount used earlier. Therefore, there is a feasibility of sustainable coalition among all ANs.

Table 4 shows the spectrum allocation results from different solution techniques for the instance of above considered data. From our utility design, the corresponding utilities of the ANs from their received spectrum are also calculated and are indicated as utility vectors in the table. It is evident from the table that max X  min fairness method satisfies bid of the lowest bidder first. t -value allocates more spectrum to the highest bidder than Shapley value at this instance whereas, Shapley value allocates more spectrum to the lowest bidder compared to t -value. This is because t -value is calculated from the difference between utopia payoff and mini-mum payoff of different ANs. If an AN bids for more spectrum compared to the others, then difference between its maximum and minimum payoffs is also turn out to be more than others. In case of higher difference between utopia and minimum payoffs, the corresponding AN receives higher payoff in case of t -value solu-tion. Similar logic applies in case of lower bids as well.
To compare different solution concepts, we have varied the amount of distributable spectrum. The performances of different solution concepts are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 . In the X -axis of both the figures, we have plotted K dist which is the ratio of distributable spectrum and aggregate of effective demand. K dist can be expressed as follows:
K  X 
In Fig. 6 , performances of different solution techniques are shown against the objective MOD. In the figure, we have plotted dissatisfaction index against K dist . In this case, up to a certain point ( K dist  X  0.5), t -value yields almost the same result as Shapley value. However, beyond that point, Shapley value clearly outper-forms t -value (up to 5.58%) and max X  X in fairness solution. The reason behind this may be explained as follows. Since Shapley value distributes slightly more spectrum to lesser bids, it reduces the overall dissatisfaction of the heterogeneous network consid-erably compared to other techniques. Performance of max X  X in fairness is worse than Shapley value and t -value because it only satisfies demand of the least bidder on priority basis. As a result,
ANs with more bids are being deprived resulting in greater overall dissatisfaction of the heterogeneous network.

In Fig. 7 , we have studied the performances of different solution techniques against the objective MED by plotting Jain X  X  fairness against K dist . According to Fig. 7 , Shapley value fares better Dissatisfaction Index compared to the solution provided by t -value (up to 4.2%) in most of the cases. This is because, since t -value depends on the difference between utopia payoff and minimum payoff, AN with more difference tend to receive more spectrum. Hence, there exists an inherent element of inequality in this approach. Therefore, Shapley value outperforms t -value as far as MED is concerned.
Hence to satisfy the objective (MED) of the LSC, dynamic spectrum allocation strategy should be guided by the Shapley value. Max X  min fairness solution appears as worse performer than Shapley value and t -value techniques.

LSC to devise efficient strategies for spectrum distribution depending upon its objective and available spectrum. The LSC may also use combination of both objectives to suit its overall strategy of SP. In that case, Shapley value solution will be the preferred solution as it performs reasonable well in case of both the objectives. 6. Conclusion
In a spectrum constrained situation, when an SP offers multi-ple technologies (ANs), it is expected that the SP should be able to distribute its available spectrum in a fair manner so as to meet the demands of ANs in an optimum manner. In real-life situation, available spectrum with the SP and/or demands placed by different ANs may change at any point of time. This calls for a dynamic spectrum management strategy to be devised at the SP end. This work shows that this maximum-demand and optimum-supply kind of a problem may probably be best modeled as an n -player (AN) game. More precisely, here we have formulated the dynamic spectrum allocation problem as an n -player cooperative bankruptcy game. We have also quantified the benefits received by ANs (upon receipt of a certain amount of spectrum) and indicative of which is the utility function designed by us. We have solved the game-theoretic problem for satisfying the objec-tives of the SP as well as for reaping the benefits by the ANs. We have employed the solution concepts like Shapley value, t -value and max X  X in fairness for obtaining best possible spectrum allocation solutions under varied situations. Through extensive simulation studies, we have shown that if the objective of the SP is MED, Shapley value provides us the best possible solution. On the other hand if the objective of the SP could be identified as MOD, a hybrid solution technique combining Shapley value and t -value would be the preferred choice.
