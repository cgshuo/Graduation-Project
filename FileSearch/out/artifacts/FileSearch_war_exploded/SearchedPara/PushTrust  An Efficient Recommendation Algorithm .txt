 The significance of social-enhanced recommender systems is increasing, along with its practicality, as online reviews, rat-ings, friendship links, and follower relationships are increas-ingly becoming available. In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information, such as trust and distrust relations in recommendation algorithms. The goal is to improve the quality of suggestions and miti-gate the data sparsity and the cold-start users problems in existing systems. In this paper, we introduce a general col-laborative social ranking model to rank the latent features of users extracted from rating data based on the social con-text of users. In contrast to existing social regularization methods, the proposed framework is able to simultaneously leverage trust, distrust, and neutral relations, and has a lin-ear dependency on the social network size. By integrating the ranking based social regularization idea into the matrix factorization algorithm, we propose a novel recommenda-tion algorithm, dubbed PushTrust . Our experiments on the Epinions dataset demonstrate that collaboratively ranking the latent features of users by exploiting trust and distrust relations leads to a substantial increase in performance, and to effectively deal with cold-start users problem.

Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in recent years, and are applied in a variety of applications [ 12 ]. Typ-ically, the recommendation system selects a small set from the underlying pool of items (e.g., products, news, movies, books) to recommend to an active user. The user can either like (e.g., read, click, buy, etc.) or dislike the items in the list, or take no action. Content-based filtering (CB) and collabo-rative filtering (CF) are well-known examples of recommen-dation approaches. As demonstrated in KDD Cup [5 ] and Netflix competition [ 2], the most successful recommenda-tion technique used is collaborative filtering which exploits the users X  opinions (e.g., movie ratings) and/or purchasing (e.g., watching, reading) history in order to extract a set of interesting items for each user. In fictionalization based CF methods, both users and items are mapped into a latent feature space based on observed ratings that are later used to make predictions.

Despite significant improvements on recommendation ap-proaches, and in particular collaborative filtering based methods, these systems suffer from a few inherent limita-tions that must be addressed. In particular, these techniques suffer from data sparsity in real-world scenarios and fail to address users who rated few or no items or items that have not been rated by any user X  commonly known as cold-start users and items problems, respectively. For instance, accord-ing to [ 24 ], the density of extant ratings in most commercial recommender systems is often much less than one.

In recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with rating data to improve the performance of recommender systems and resolve sparsity and cold-start problems (see e.g. [29 , 25 , 6] for more recent surveys). A well-known example is the FilmTrust system [ 7]. This is an online social network that provides movie rating and review features to its users. The social networking component of the website requires users to provide a trust rating for each person they add as a friend. The main motivation for ex-ploiting trust information in recommendation process stems from the observation that the ideas we are exposed to and the choices we make are significantly influenced by our so-cial context. For example, in [26 ] it was pointed out that people tend to rely more on recommendations from others they trust more than recommendations based on anonymous people similar to them. This observation, combined with the growing popularity of open social networks, has generated a
