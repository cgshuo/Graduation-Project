 This special issue contains six articles on open source analyt-ics. It includes an article describing the Weka data mining system, two articles on infrastructure to support analytics, an article on the PMML standard for statistical and data mining models, an article on how clouds are being used in analytics, and an article about an open source tool for clean-ing data. We introduce the articles in this special issue by discussing five trends in open source analytics.
 Trend 1. The first trend is that open source software for statistics and data mining has matured and reached a crit-ical mass. R (www.r-project.org), which was first released in 1996, is now the most widely deployed open source sys-tem for statistical computing. A recent article in the New York Times estimated that over 250,000 individuals use R regularly [4].
 Another very popular open source system for data mining is the Weka system. Weka is described in an article in this issue by Mark Hall, Eibe Frank, Geoffrey Holmes, Bernhard Pfahrin, Peter Reutemann and Ian H. Witten called the  X  X he WEKA Data Mining Software: An Update. X  Trend 2. The second trend is that standards for statistics and data mining have matured sufficiently that they can can now serve as a foundation for open, standards based architectures for analytic applications.
 The Predictive Model Markup Language or PMML [1] is an XML language for describing statistical and data mining models in an application and system independent fashion. With PMML, models can be exchanged easily between sys-tems and persisted to repositories.
 This issue contains an article about PMML by Rick Pechter called  X  X hat X  X  PMML and What X  X  New in PMML 4.0? X  Trend 3. It is difficult to analyze datasets without good tools for managing them. Databases have been used since they were introduced to help manage data for data min-ing. More recently, more specialized tools, such as Hadoop [2] have been developed. Hadoop is an open source system that has dramatically simplified the management and anal-ysis of large datasets. The term analytic infrastructure is beginning to be used to describe the services, applications, utilities and systems that are used for either preparing data for modeling, estimating models, validating models, scoring data, or related activities.
 This issue contains an article titled  X  X NIME  X  The Kon-stanz Information Miner X  by Michael R. Berthold, Nicolas Cebron, Fabian Dill, Thomas R. Gabriel, Tobias K  X otter, Thorsten Meinl, Peter Ohl, Kilian Thiel and Bernd Wiswedel that describes a system which enables the visual assembly and interactive execution of a data analysis pipeline. There is also an article that I wrote giving a brief introduc-tion to analytic infrastructure.
 Trend 4. A particularly important type of analytic infras-tructure are clouds. The fourth trend is the growing impor-tance of cloud-based services for analytics. Although there is no standard definition of clouds, clouds can be defined as on-demand services and resources available over a network, often the Internet, that are offered with the scale and reli-ablity of a data center. A recent publication by NIST [3] defines clouds and covers some of their main characteristics. This issue contains an article by Alex Guazzelli, Kostantinos Stathatos and Michael Zeller about predictive analytics and cloud computing called  X  X fficient Deployment of Predictive Analytics through Open Standards and Cloud Computing. X  X  Trend 5. The final trend is the commoditization of data. Moore X  X  law applies not only to CPUs, but also to the chips that are used in all of the digital devices that produce data. The result has been that the cost to produce data has been falling for some time. This, combined with the fact that the cost to store data has also been falling at the speed of Moore X  X  law, is resulting in the increasing availability of datasets.
 The availability of all this data, sometimes without charge, is enriching analytics. With the growing amount of data, data quality issues are critical.
 The final article in this issue is an article by Peter Chris-ten about an open source tool for cleaning data called  X  X e-velopment and User Experiences of an Open Source Data Cleaning, Deduplication and Record Linkage System. X  [1] Data Mining Group. Predictive Model Markup Language [2] Hadoop. Welcome to Hadoop! hadoop.apache.org/core/, [3] Peter Mell and Tim Grance. Draft nist working definition [4] Ashlee Vance. Data analysts captivated by R X  X  power.
