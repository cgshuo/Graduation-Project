 To the best of our knowledge, the research on automated knowledge discovery in China started in the early 1990s when Yihua Wu, a PhD student supervised by Prof. Shulin Wang, who finished his thesis on discovering scientific rules fro m a large set of experimental data. Wu X  X  research followed and extended the work of Professor Pat Langley in scientific knowledge discovery. At almost the same time, Prof. Zhongzhi Shi published his book  X  X rinciples of Machine Learning X  where knowledge dis covery is extensively discussed. The first three papers on data mining appeared in Chinese academic journals and were published in 1997. Two events played very important role in pushing KDD research forward in China. The first one wa s the 1998 IBM Summer School on Data Mining and Data Warehousing. Prof. Jiawei Han and Prof. Hongjun Lu were the two only lecturers of the summer school, which attracted almost 100 attendees from the major universities of China. The second event is PAKDD 1999 held in Beijing, which was the first international conference of KDD organized in China (the second such event PAKDD 2007 was held 8 years later in Nanjing, and the third event PAKDD 2011 was held 12 years later in Shenzhen). This event provided a valuable opportunity for Chinese researchers and students to show their early achievements on KDD.
 The most recent and significant research on data mining and knowledge discovery is knowledge mining from the Web and the Internet. The Internet is a huge, dynamic and open reservoir of data and knowledg e. An important work is Prof. Cungen Cao X  X  research on concept acquisition from Internet data. The result of his research is a knowledge base with more than 3 million concepts, more than 4 million concept relationships, and more than 8 0,000 concept attributes. We are very happy that KDD 2012 will be held in China, and we believe that this event will surely inject new impetus to KDD research in China, and will play an essential role in pushing the internationalization and applications of China X  X  KDD research. Our contributions to KDD are mainly in biological data mining area.  X  Microarray data mining A 3D cluster over gene -sample -time (simply GST) microarray data may contain in formation on useful phenotypes, their related potential genes and expression rules. Our 3D cluster -mining algorithm gTRICLUSTER is based on a more general model and can find more biologically meaningful coherent gene clusters than the existing one. It also outperforms TRICLUSTER [1] in robustness in noisy data.
 Bayesian Networks (BN) can be used to predict gene regulatory networks using microarray data, but they suffer from insufficient samples and huge search space. Our new method of learning BN introduces fuzzy clustering algorithm to reduce the search space. From the view of systems biology, modularity and hierarchy are key features of biological networks. This allows us to gain insight into global biological networks by assembling local components.  X  Pro moter prediction based on pattern mining Core promoters are a key clue in understanding gene regulations. We devised a uniform framework by using pattern -based nearest neighbor search to predict promoters based on the structural features of promoters. We first mine structural patterns from sequences, and then evaluate the similarity between sequences based on the pattern similarity. The proposed pattern -based approach can significantly improve performance of promoter prediction.  X  Protein domain, location s tructure and function In this area, our research focused on domain prediction system (KemaDom) based on ab initio method, established by assembling three kernel machines with local context information among neighboring amino acids; prediction of protein subcellular localization based on Gene Ontology Transfer; prediction of protein subnuclear organelles based on K -spectrum kernel method; taxonomic fold recognition using SVM with autocross -covariance (ACC) transformation; prediction of 3D structur es of proteins from amino acid sequences based on effective interaction potentials; prediction of protein -protein interaction sites based on effective ensemble learning method; iterative semi -supervised algorithm (SemiHS) improving the accuracy of hot spot s prediction.  X  miRNA prediction and classification An ensemble SVM classifier was established to deal with the imbalance issue of miRNA gene mining where multi -loop features are included for identifying the pre -miRNAs with multi -loops. Besides, a multiclas s SVM employing n-grams to extract features from known precursor sequences was proposed to classify new miRNAs.  X  Biomedical text mining A new strategy for clustering MEDLINE documents that incorporates MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) similarity was propose d. We also proposed a new finite mixture model FICM for clustering multiple -field documents. Experimental results show that FICM outperformed the classical multinomial model and the multivariate Bernoulli model at a statistically significant level.  X  Immun oinformatics Another focus of our research is predicting antigenic peptides binding to major histocompat ibility complex (MHC) molecules, which is the prerequisite of cellular immune responses . We developed a new Web server, MetaMHC, to integrate the outputs of leading predictors by several popular ensemble strategies. MetaMHCI achieved good prediction results in an international competition, and outperformed two well -known predictors in all six categories and was awarded the winner in one of the categories.  X  Generalized center string problem is fixed parameter This is a problem in which one is asked to find all substrings of length l coinciding with a (hidden) motif up to d mismatches in at least q of the N strings of length L. We proved that this problem is fixed parameter tractable with our Bpriori algorithm. Effectiveness and efficiency will still be the focus of KDD algorithm research. On one hand, to develop hi ghly effective KDD algorithms and tools, we need essential break -through in KDD theories and techniques, which greatly rely on the advances in statistics, machine learning and other data analysis disciplines. On the other hand, for boosting the efficiency of KDD processes, there are two possible research directions: 1) developing high -performance computing paradigms or platforms to support KDD tasks, 2) exploring novel data access methods to enable efficiently massive data mining. Generally speaking, KDD t echniques are domain -specific. We believe that the most promising KDD research areas in the future are:  X  KDD in networked data such as Web data and social  X  KDD in biological d ata/texts to perform genome -wide tasks KDD in financial data. In particular, real time (non NP -complete) stream data mining algorithms are needed to detect fraud behaviors and potential risks in financial markets. [1] Lizhuang Zhao and Mohammed J. Zaki. 2005.
