Investigating the structure and function of complex networks such as biochemical and social networks is a hot research subject [2,5,15]. From a functional view, innovation, topics and even malicious rumors can propagate through social networks among people in the form of so-called  X  X ord-of-mouth X  communications. Therefore, considerable attention has recently been devoted to social networks as an important medium for the spread of information [4,7,13,14,21].

There are several models that simulate information diffusion through a network. A widely-used problem , and is one of the important application problems in sociology and  X  X iral marketing X  [1]. estimate them.
 One of the drawbacksof the IC modelis that it cannotrepresenttime-delay for information propagation. Consider, as an example, modeling the day-by-day spread of a topic in a blog network in which blog authors are connected to each other as is done in [7]. Here, a topic is a URL or phrase that can be w u Note that the ICTD model includes the IC model as a special case. The ICTD model is equipped with probabilities t hrough links.

They presented a method for estimating the values of these parameters from observed information For example, Newman and Park [16] observed that social networks represented as undirected graphs at different time in the past. Their method [7], however, ignores this phenomenon and we speculate that their method does not perform well for dense networks, which is experimentally demonstrated in the parameter values. We have already developed a method in [11] for estimating the values of the parameters in case of the IC model. The problem was much simpler because of no time-delay. sequence observation data structural. There is no way of knowing from the data which node activated states increases exponentially, which also makes computation intractable. We introduce an objective experimentally show using both one synthetic and three real world networks that the proposed method predict the in fl uence of nodes by which to rank and extract in fl uential nodes.
Our contribution is that 1) we derived an algorithm in a principled way that guarantees convergence, performance of the eGGLT method for a dense netwo rk is attributed to the i gnorance of the multiple activation. We further point out that 3) the ranking method based on the proposed algorithm can be interpreted as a new concept of centrality based on information diffusion. 2. Information diffusion model and learning problem Gruhl et al. [7]. After that, we formulate our learning problem.

In this paper, we consider mathematical models for the spread of information through a directed and links, respectively.

In the ICTD model, for each link ( u, v )  X  E , we specify real values r u,v and  X  u,v with in advance. Gruhl et al. [7] considered modeling the spread of a topic in a blog network, where blog authors are connected by a directed network. The parameter r u,v models how early author v reads the r
The diffusion process of the model p roceeds from a given i nitial active node v each currently inactive child node v . We choose a delay-time  X  from the geometric distribution with are possible. 2.3. Learning problem
For the ICTD model on network G ,wede fi ne the time-delay parameter vector r and the diffusion parameter vector  X  by In practice, the true values of r and  X  are not available. Thus, we must estimate them from past information diffusion histories observed as sets of active nodes.
 We suppose that of active nodes for the m th information diffusion result, observed fi nal time-step. We set v diffusion result, that is, In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the values of r and  X  from D M . 3. Proposed method Here, we explain how we estimate the values of r and  X  from D M .

 h to derive L ( r ,  X  ; D M ) . Here, to calculate h m,v , we introduce an indicator vector that if there exi st multiple active parents for the node v , i.e., Thus we can regard the indicator vector a m,  X  ,v as a latent vector, the number of hidden states of computation formulas (see Eqs (5) and (16) below).
 t m,v ,thatis, within the time-period [ t m,u +1 ,t m,v ] ,thatis, By using the indicator vector a m,  X  ,v , the probability h m,v can naturally be expressed as where the summation is taken over all non-zero indicator (binary) vectors, and where the summation is taken over all indicator (binary) vectors. Thus, by Equation (4), we have occurrences of non-zero indicator vectors.
 the observed time-period [0 ,T m ] . We can easily derive the following equation: the observed fi nal time, i.e., Thus, as T m  X  X  X  in Eq. (6), we assume Therefore, by using Eqs (5) and (7), and the independence properties, we can de fi ne the likelihood function L ( r ,  X  ; D M ) with respect to r and  X  by { based on an iterative algorithm in order to stably obtain its solution. 3.2. Estimation method
We describe our method for estimating the optimal values of r and  X  . We suppose that are the current estimates of r and  X  , respectively. We derive update formulas of r and  X  such that For each v  X  C m ( T m ) and indicator vector a m,  X  ,v ,wede fi ne q m,v ( a m,  X  ,v ) by B
From Eqs (3), (7), and (8), we can transform our objective function L ( r ,  X  ; D M ) as follows: Here, Q ( r ,  X  ; r ,  X  ) is de fi ned by where Also, H ( r ,  X  ; r ,  X  ) is de fi ned by where (see Eq. (10)).
 where Note that 0 &lt;  X  m,u,v &lt; 1. Then, we can easily show that this problem of log B m,u,v , we transform log B m,u,v in the same way as Eq. (10): where and Here,  X  m,u,v is de fi ned by Q ( r ,  X  ; r ,  X  ) by where Hence, we have the following theorem.

Then, if we update the values of r and  X  by for all ( u, v )  X  E , we have converges to at least locally optimal solutions, and we can propose a method similar to EM algorithm respectively. 4.

 formulas for r and  X  are as follows: for all u, v  X  V with u = v ,where and Here, S + u,v and S  X  u,v are de fi ned by We note that they did not derive the EM-like algorithm in a principled way. No objective function is Eq. (30).

Now, we de fi ne the eGGLT method. The eGGLT method straightforwardly incorporates the link structure E into the original method by Gruhl et al. [7]. Namely, the eGGLT method only changes the D
M when the underlying network structure is known. Therefore, the eGGLT method can be also applied in fl uential nodes. 5.2. Conventional methods in social network analysis compare the proposed method with four heuristics from social network analysis, which are the degree, the betweenness, the closeness, and the PageRank methods.

We also consider measuring the in fl uence of each node by its  X  X uthoritativeness X  obtained by the of a random web surfer,  X  corresponds to the probab ility with which a surfer jumps to a page picked uniformly at random [17]. In our expe riments, we used a typical setting of  X  = 0.15. 6. Experimental evaluation
We fi rst compared the proposed method with the e GGLT method for the capab ility of estimating the values of r and  X  in the case of a complete graph. Next, using three large real social networks, we nodes. 6.1. Experimental settings
According to [7], we generated the training data D M by simulating the true ICTD model M from every single node as being an initial active node, where M = M values of r and  X  from D M , we always used the same initial guess and the same iteration number for the proposed and the eGGLT methods. Strictly speaking, we always set the initial values of r and  X  the solutions are judged to be converged.
 of applying the method of [9] with the parameter value 10,000 to the corresponding IC model, where the parameter represents the number of bond percolation processes (see [9] for more details). 6.2. Synthetic network exploited the complete directed graph of 50 nodes as the network G =( V, E ) . Note that the eGGLT dataset as the complete graph dataset.

We compared the capability of estimating the values of r and  X  for the proposed and the eGGLT methods. Table 1 shows the results for different number of simulations M method. 6.3. Real networks 6.3.1. Network dataset
As a large real social network G =( V, E ) ,we fi rst employed the blog network used in [10]. This was a bidirectional network with 12,047 nodes and 79,920 directed links. Again, we used r u,v =2 / 3 network dataset.

Second, we employed a network derived from the Enron Email Dataset [12]. We fi rst extracted the email addresses that appeared in the Enron Email Dataset as senders and recipients. We regarded each email address as a node, and constructed an undirected network obtained by linking two email strongly connected component, and constructed a directed network by regarding those undirected links
Third, we employed the co-authorship network used in [18]. This was a bidirectional network with 12,357 nodes and 38,896 directed links. For the co-authorship network, we used r u,v =2 / 3 and  X  u,v =1 / 5 for any ( u, v )  X  E as the true values of r and  X  , since the mean out-degree of the co-authorship network is much smaller than the blog and the Enron networks. In fact, when we used  X  than 15). We refer to this dataset as the co-authorship network dataset. 6.3.2. Experimental results results for different number of simulations M as in Table 1. We observe that the proposed method outperforms the eGGLT method for all of these there is a reasonable amount of training data.
 true ICTD model. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the results in the case of M and the eGGLT methods, respectively. We observe from these fi gures that unlike the eGGLT method, rank k , which is de fi ned by top k nodes. Table 5 compares the errors by the two methods for the three datasets in case of k = 20 the eGGLT method is about 500 times greater than E ( k ) of the proposed method. Therefore, we see eGGLT method.

Next, we evaluated the performance for ranking the top 200 in fl uential nodes under the true ICTD k in the case of M the eGGLT, the degree, the betweenness, the closeness, and the PageRank methods, respectively. For the blog network dataset, the proposed method performed best, and the eGGLT method followed. The other methods (the conventional methods in social network analysis) were much worse than these two methods. For the Enron network dataset, the proposed method performed best, and the eGGLT and the out-degree methods followed. The performance difference between the eGGLT and the out-degree methods was small. For example, the eGGLT method was worse than the out-degree method for the ranking similarity within rank k = 200. For the co-authorship network dataset, the proposed method performed best, and the eGGLT method followed. The other methods (the conventional methods in that the proposed method works effectively. 7. Discussion We attribute this to the inadequacy of the parameter estimation methods and the different setting of that a node v can be activated simultaneously by multiple parents { u } that has become activated at different times (although v is activated only once), whereas the eGGLT method does not assume this that the above multiple activation possibility is essentially 0. However, the network we used in our the possibility of a node being activated simultaneously from more than one parent node would most method for the Enron network were worst. This is consistent with the discussion above. Compared with the eGGLT method, our method derives the learning algorithm in a principled way. It has the objective function which has a clear meaning of the likelihood of obtaining the observed with the convergence guaranteed. Therefore, for large real social networks, the proposed method far very important. Further note that, in deriving the proposed algorithm, tactics are employed to avoid computational explosion.

We consider that our ranking method presents a novel concept of centrality based on the information ranked by our method are substantially different from those by each of the conventional methods in social network analysis. This means that our method enables a new type of social network analysis if in terms of information diffusion.

It is not clear at the moment whether the similar approach can be which case the evaluation must be based on a task-speci fi c performance measure for each task. 8. Conclusion We addressed the problem of estimating the parameters for an information diffusion model (i.e., the ICTD model) in a complex social network, given the network topology and the observed time-sequence formulated the likelihood of obtaining the observed sequence data, and proposed an EM-like iterative complete graph that the proposed method outperforms a slightly modi fi ed existing method eGGLT in estimating correct parameters. Next, we showed by using three real world networks that the proposed ICTD model than the eGGLT method. Moreover, we demonstrated that it outperforms the eGGLT method and the conventional methods in social network analysis for ranking the in fl uential nodes. will also be our future work.
