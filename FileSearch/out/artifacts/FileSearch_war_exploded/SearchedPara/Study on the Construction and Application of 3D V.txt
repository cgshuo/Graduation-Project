 Constructing unified integrated digital platform and virtual environment and develop-ing powerful system software and mathematics model are the key issues in the con-struction of the Digital Yellow River Programme. The analysis on construction and application of 3D visualization platform for the Yellow River Basin is to study how to input the Yellow River Basin into computer visually, vividly and systematically, con-visualized integrate digital platform and vi rtual environment for the other application systems in the Digital Yellow River Programme. The 3D visualization platform construction for the Yellow River Basin shall not only study how to input the whole basin into computer, but also consider how to make the application systems in the Digital Yellow River Programme. This has created a higher requirement for the platform construction. 2.1 Practice of Platform Construction for the Basin During 2003 to 2004, according to the overall arrangement of the Digital Yellow River Programme, Yellow River Engineering Consulting Co., Ltd (YREC) has devel-oped the Interactive 3D Visualization System for the Yellow River lower reach. The system inputs the Yellow River lower reach into computer visually, vividly and sys-tematically by adopting advanced computer techniques such as GIS, RS, 3D Model-ing, VR, etc. This platform can help users swiftly overview, acknowledge, and study study and analysis circumstance for the management and development of the Yellow River lower reach. User Interface of Interactive 3D Visualization System for the Yellow River Lower Reach is shown as Fig. 1. The design and development of Interactive 3D Visualization System for Yellow River form construction for basin and provided sound technical base for construction. 2.2 Basic Thought and Key Technique for 3D Visualization Platform Construction for the Yellow River Basin 3D visualization platform for the Yellow River Basin shall further take the river train-ing requirements from all sides into consideration to construct the flexible and multi-integrated analysis. The following key technical issues must be properly dealt with in constructing 3D visualization platform for the Yellow River Basin through the study and development of interactive 3D visualization platform for the Yellow River lower reach. (1) Effective Management of Mass Data The 3D visualization platform for the Yellow River Basin shall construct and present a 3D virtual environment for the whole basin, and construction of the 3D models for base of mass data. How to store and manage the mass data is a key technical issue in the 3D visualization platform construction for the Yellow River Basin. (2) Data Update Dynamics As a applicable platform to serve the Yellow River training, the scene data in the 3D quires a real-time update of DEM (digital elevation model) and DOM (digital objec-tive model) data and of property data in the 3D landform scene for the basin. (3) Quick Positioning of 3D Mass Scene Because the basin covers larger area, users hope the system can reach any place in the scene quickly, which means a quick scene positioning in mass environment. How to conduct a quick positioning of 3D mass scene according to scene project and culture feature title is the key technical issue in the 3D visualization platform construction for the Yellow River Basin. (4) GIS Analysis in 3D Mass Environment In the 3D virtual environment, we usually need to acknowledge some information, Yellow River Basin needs to conduct the research work on GIS analysis in 3D mass environment. (5) Combination with Distributed Mathematic Model As for the application of basin size, it is necessary to solve the problems in combina-tion between the 3D visualization platform and the distributed mathematic model for the basin properly because the distributed mathematic model for the basin is the base for solving the problems about the water in the basin. River Lower Reach shows that the 3D platform can offer more sufficient information and representation means that 2D platform and it will provide a background platform for visual picture system. We have carried out the following application research excellent achievements. 3.1 Study on Application Combined with GIS-Based 2D Flow/Sediment Model for the Yellow River Lower Reach The GIS-based 2D Flow-sediment Mathematical Model for Yellow River Lower Reach (referred as 2D Flow-sediment Model) is another study item in the Digital Yellow River Programme, which is to establish the advanced and practical mathe-sediment scouring and deposition changes of the channel in the lower reach to simu-utilization of the Interactive 3D Visualization System for Yellow River Lower Reach combined with the 2D Flow-sediment Model mainly will raise the calculation result level of the 2D Flow-sediment Model, it can become a virtual experiment platform to support for flood control decision-making. Fig.2 is an application interface for Inter-active 3D Visualization System for Yellow River Lower Reach combined with the 2D Flow-sediment Model. 3.2 Study on Application Combined with the Lab X  X ng Yellow River During the construction of the Three Yellow Rivers, the Digital Yellow River and the simulated by computers through utilizing the Digital Yellow River and several the Digital Yellow River will be examined by the Lab X  X ng Yellow River and workable River Lower Reach considered as the 3D digital platform of the Digital Yellow River can also be regarded as the digital representing platform of the Lab X  X ng Yellow River that can present the experiment results of the Lab X  X ng Yellow River in 3D way. Dur-ing the research on the Regulation Plan for Braided Reach and Channel of the Yellow River Lower Reach, the project staff and the engineers majoring in the Interactive 3D Visualization System for the Yellow River Lower Reach have carried out the study on and have represented the experiment results of the Lab X  X ng Yellow River towards the channel regulation plan in 3D way through overlying the vector Lab X  X ng Yellow River experiment data on the 3D digital platform. And by this means, one can represent the decision-making. 3.3 Study on Application in the Flood Control in the Yellow River Lower Reach Consulting system for project and emergency situation can be developed and articu-lated on the 3D visualization platform and a 3D visualized consulting system for pro-ject and emergency situation is established. Articulating GIS-based 2D flood evolu-platform for decision-making support in the lower reach flood control. 
The evolution of flood hydrograph in various grades with various formation causes process of flood in various grades in the channel can be represented visually. 
Based on the flood evolution result, the evacuation plan for the people in the flooded plain in the lower reach under the condition of various flood grades or other effective measure for risk avoiding can be formulated, and the duration necessary for ment, etc., shall be ascertained for the project with possible risk. 3.4 Study on Application in the Flood Control in the Yellow River Lower Reach form and a background platform for water dispatch of the whole basin can be formed through developing the corresponding dispatch model to supply the all-side technical support for water dispatch management and decision-making. 3.5 Study on Application in Planning, Construction and Management of Flood Control Project in the Yellow River Lower Reach The construction and application of the 3D visualization platform for the Yellow River lower reach shows that the construction of the 3D visualization platform is very important for the Yellow River regulation and development and it is an important be in a more extensive range and can provide all-side, systematic and visualized tech-nical support for the regulation, development, research and management of the basin. It can be seen from the analysis on construction and application of the 3D visualiza-research on regulation and development of the river basin and it provides a back-ground platform for systematic analysis and study on the issues about the Yellow the platform supplies measures which are more economical for the study on the issues about the Yellow River. Much research work which needed to be carried out through model or topographic experiments in the past can now be realized by mathematic model which reflects the rule. This provides powerful technical measures for multi-plan research and is of great importance in the research on basin rule for the purpose of maintaining the healthy life of the Yellow River.
