 1. Introduction
Visually imperceptible image hiding involves hiding one or more secret images into another non-critical image with min-imal perceptible degradation. However, the hiding capacity and the distortion of cover image are a trade-off. This is because more hidden information always results in more visually perceptible degradation on the cover image. Recently, visually imperceptible data hiding schemes have been widely studied and many research reports ( Chan &amp; Cheng, 2004; Chang &amp;
Wu, 2006; Chang, Wu, &amp; Chen, 2008; Chen, Chang, &amp; Hwang, 1998; Chung, Shen, &amp; Chang, 2001; Du &amp; Hsu, 2003; Hu, quantization (VQ) technique is usually applied in the procedure of data hiding. In addition, the least-significant-bit (LSB) substitution technique is also commonly utilized in the procedure of data embedding.

Visually imperceptible image hiding can be used for covert communication. In the prior researches, raw images without any compression are directly embedded into cover images. To solve the problem of inefficient hiding capacity, Chen et al. (1998) proposed an idea that secret images should be compressed by VQ and then encrypted before the hiding process, which is called virtual image cryptosystem ( Chen et al., 1998 ). In 2003, Hu (2003) proposed a revised algorithm of virtual image cryptosystem ( Hu, 2003 ). In Hu X  X  scheme, each pixel value of the cover image was split into two parts. The significant one is used for VQ codebook training, and the insignificant one is used for data embedding by the greedy substitution. Con-sequently, several secret images can be hidden into another cover image by Hu X  X  scheme. Hu X  X  scheme provides greater hid-ing capacity and lower computational cost than that of Chen et al. X  X  scheme ( Chen et al., 1998 ). It also provides better image quality for secret images. Nevertheless, the quality of extracted secret images at the receiver is not good enough. Further-more, the visual quality of secret images decreases badly when more secret images have to be hidden into the cover image.
This is because for Hu X  X  scheme, it is necessary to reduce the codebook size for decreasing the volume of each compressed secret image. In order to improve the efficiency of image information hiding, Lin and Shie (2004) proposed a novel idea to capacity of the cover medium and on the quality of extracted secret images at the receiver. To achieve a high-capacity and high-quality secret image transmission scheme, the VQ technique is applied in this scheme to compact the volume of secret images. Moreover, to guarantee the visual quality of extracted secret images at the receiver, the VQ codebook utilized in the encoding procedure is adopted as cover medium. Lin and Shie X  X  scheme provides a new and original approach to transmit a set of secret images via network, especially for limited-bandwidth communication channel. Although the appearance of cov-er medium in Lin and Shie X  X  scheme looks like a meaningless data stream to the possible interceptors, however, the cover medium is a VQ codebook, not a visually recognizable image. This may limit its practical application when the property of visually imperceptibility is required.

In this article, a novel visually imperceptible image hiding scheme that improves both Hu X  X  scheme and Lin and Shie X  X  scheme is presented. To design a high-capacity and high-quality image information hiding scheme, we incorporate the
VQ technique into this scheme to compact the volume of secret images. Moreover, to adaptively guarantee the visual quality of extracted secret images at the receiver, the VQ codebook utilized in the encoding procedure is slightly modified and totally embedded into the cover image. The proposed scheme provides a visually imperceptible image hiding approach to deliver a ceptible image hiding scheme are presented in Section 2 . Section 3 addresses experimental results and discussions. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 4 . 2. The proposed scheme
In the proposed visually imperceptible image hiding scheme, the input of the transmitter is a set of secret images and a non-critical cover image, and the output of the transmitter is a stego-image with high visual quality. The goal of this scheme is to deliver a set of images secretly via a meaningful cover image of the same size.

Assume that there are t secret images to be delivered and these images are 8-bit gray level images of w h pixels. To compress the secret images with VQ, a codebook should be generated before the encoding procedure. Let the size of VQ code-book be N c and the codeword be composed of m n elements. These N Linde X  X uzo X  X ray (LBG) algorithm ( Linde, Buzo, &amp; Gray, 1980 ) using the secret images as the training set. After the codebook
C is generated, each of these secret images is partitioned into blocks of m n pixels. Each image block is then encoded into a binary index of codeword. The term of binary index means the index of codeword is manipulated or processed in binary form. That is, each one of the N c codewords is represented by a bit-string of length log all secret images is obtained by merging these binary indices. Therefore, the whole volume l (in the unit of bit) of the com-pressed information for secret images can be defined by the following equation.
To embed multiple images into another cover image with minimal perceptible degradation and preserve good visual quality for secret images, the compressed information of secret images is first embedded into the VQ codebook associated with these images and the modified codebook is then embedded into the cover image. Let the number of modified least-significant-bits (LSBs) for each codeword element and each cover image pixel be d and r , respectively. For 8-bit gray level images, the fol-lowing two formulas must be satisfied to accomplish the proposed image information hiding scheme.
The flow charts of the proposed scheme are given in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 a describes the secret image hiding procedures at transmit-ter whereas the processes of secret image extraction at receiver are presented in Fig. 1 b. The relative parameters used in this embedded into the cover image. Note that the compressed information, the codeword indices, of secret images can be further compressed on the basis of some famous lossless compression techniques such as arithmetic coding ( Witten, Neal, &amp; Cleary,
DES cryptosystem ( National Technical Information Service, 1997 ) to make it an encrypted and meaningless message. Fur-thermore, the encrypted codebook can be also losslessly compressed before it was embedded into the cover image. Finally, a stego-image covering a set of secret images is generated.

The procedure of secret images extraction is quite simple at the receiver. To reconstruct the secret images, the encrypted modified codebook and the relative parameters are directly fetched from the stego-image. The encrypted codebook is first decrypted based on the DES decryption procedure. After the decryption process, the modified codebook C 0 is directly ob-tained. Therefore, the compressed information of secret images can be directly extracted from the codebook. With the parameters, including the number of secret images t , the image size w and h , the codeword size m and n , and the codebook size N c , the compressed information of secret images can be decoded by performing table look-up operation on the modified codebook C 0 . Finally, all the secret images are reconstructed. 3. Experimental results
In the computer experiments, the proposed image information hiding scheme has been performed on a set of four images ( X  X  X irplane X ,  X  X  X ena X ,  X  X  X epper X , and  X  X  X oys X ).  X  X  X irplane X  is used as cover image and the other three images are used as secret images. These test images are all with size 512 512 pixels and 256 levels (8 bits) per pixel. To reduce the overall volume of image information that needs to be embedded into the cover image, the three secret images were divided into image blocks with 8 8 pixels and the VQ codebook size is 1024. Consequently, there are 65,536 (1024 8 8) elements and 524,288 (1024 8 8 8) bits in this codebook. The length of each codeword index is 10 bits and the compressed information for each secret image is 40,960 (10 (512 512)/(8 8)) bits. In this experiment, the compressed information of the three secret images can be simultaneously embedded into the codebook, without the need of any further compression, by adap-tively modifying the first and the second LSBs of each codeword elements. Therefore, 960 codewords of the codebook are enough to embed the compressed information of the three secret images. Note that in the proposed scheme, the codebook utilized at the receiver is slightly different from the one used at the transmitter. However, using the modified codebook at the receiver usually introduces some quality degradation to the extracted secret images. In order to provide better visual quality for secret images, it is suggested that the number of modified LSBs within each codeword element should not exceed three. Under this circumstance, in terms of mean-squared-error (MSE), the degradation of image quality is bounded by (2 1) . Here, d is the number of modified LSBs within each codeword element. After embedding the compressed information of secret images, the modified codebook is further encrypted by the DES cryptosystem for more security. The encrypted code-book is given as Fig. 2 . To accomplish our proposed visually imperceptible scheme, the encrypted codebook is directly and totally embedded into the cover image  X  X  X irplane X , without the need of compression, by greedily modifying the first and the second LSBs of each pixel in  X  X  X irplane X  (512 512 2 = 524,288).

To demonstrate the performance of the proposed image information hiding scheme, Fig. 3 a shows the stego-Airplane in which the three secret images are hidden. In addition, the corresponding secret images extracted at the receiver are given in
Fig. 3b X  X  , respectively. To compare the proposed scheme with Hu X  X  scheme, the PSNR values of the stego-images and the extracted secret images at receiver are listed in Table 1 ( Hu, 2003 ). Note that the test images are gray-level images of 512 512 pixels, the number of secret images is 3, the vector dimension is 4 4, and the number of modified LSBs of each cover image pixel is 2 in Hu X  X  scheme. As shown in Table 1 , it reveals that our proposed image hiding scheme outperforms Hu X  X  scheme in terms of visual quality of images.

To verify the performance of our proposed image hiding scheme, the hiding capacity (the maximum number of secret images) with respect to the size of codebook, the modified LSBs in a codeword element d , and the modified LSBs in a cover image pixel r is listed in Table 2 . This table illustrates that more hiding capacity can be provided by reducing the codebook size, modifying more LSBs in each codeword element, or modifying more LSBs in each cover image pixel by the proposed scheme. For comparison, the hiding capacity of Hu X  X  scheme provided in ( Hu, 2003 ) is given in Table 3 . Note that in Table 2 , with the codebook size equals 1024, the data volume (in bit) of codebook exceeds the available number of LSBs that can be modified in the cover image when r equals 1. Consequently, the hiding capacity of our scheme is not available (NA). In addition, the hiding capacity is identical when r equals 2 and 3. This is because we can embed only one codebook with size 1024 into the cover image when r equals 3, although the third LSB bit-plane of cover image is remained unused.
To compare the proposed scheme with Lin and Shie X  X  scheme, the final appearance of cover medium in Lin and Shie X  X  scheme is given in Fig. 4 , together with the final stego-image of the proposed scheme. Note that the secret images are 512 512 gray-level images, the number of secret images is 5, the vector dimension is 8 8, the codebook size is 4096, the number of modified codewords is 3840, and the number of modified LSBs of each codeword element is 1 in Lin and Shie X  X  scheme. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the secret images in Lin and Shie X  X  scheme are covered by a meaningless data stream. On the contrary, the secret images in the proposed scheme are under the protection of another meaningful image with high visual quality as shown in Fig. 4 b. Moreover, the hiding capacity with respect to the codebook size and the modified LSBs of each element within the cover medium (codebook) of Lin and Shie X  X  scheme is provided in Table 4 . By contrast, the proposed scheme outperforms Lin and Shie X  X  scheme in terms of the visual quality of cover medium. 4. Conclusions
A novel visually imperceptible image hiding scheme capable of delivering multiple images secretly through another high-quality image has been introduced in this article. The proposed scheme provides impressive improvement both in the visual quality of extracted secret images and in the hiding capacity of the cover image. Moreover, the visual quality of the stego-image is quite good when it was compared with the original cover image. This scheme outperforms both Hu X  X  scheme and
Lin and Shie X  X  scheme because of the following reasons: (1) The secret images are included into the training set in the code-book generation procedure. (2) The volume of secret images to be transmitted is greatly reduced by applying the VQ tech-nique on these images. (3) The codebook associated with these secret images is embedded into the cover image as well. (4)
The cover medium is a meaningful image, not a meaningless data stream. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed scheme is feasible for secret image information hiding.
