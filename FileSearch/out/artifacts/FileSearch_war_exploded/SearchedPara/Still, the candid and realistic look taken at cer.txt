 The Craft of Research, 2nd edition (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing) (Paperback) by Wayne
C. Booth, Joseph M. Williams, Gregory G. Colomb. Paperback: 336 pages. University of Chicago Press; 2nd edition. ISBN: 0226065685
The Craft of Research is a really good reference book for both novice and experienced researchers. The book skillfully addresses several possible reader demographics. First, it is an instruction manual for getting the novice academic researcher from topic to outline to notes to thesis. Second, for mid-level researchers, the book illustrates the complex, sometimes illogically process that is research. Finally, for the experienced researcher, The Craft of Research is a refreshing revisit on how research should be done and what should be its impact. I liked the book a lot.

The book is packed with information, insight, and knowledge about research, why we do it and how it is done. The examples actually make sense and contribute greatly to understanding the theoretician aspects of the text. The book is very well written, with no grammar errors that I keyed in on. The prose is clear, and the authors insert their own personal experiences in the book, which helps make it a pleasant read. The book is composed of five sections. First, there is a two chapter section on starting a research project.
Second, a four chapter section deals with planning a research project. Third, the five chapter section on fram-ing ones argument is very well done. I found it very helpful in working on my research papers. Fourth, a sec-tion of five chapters addresses the issues of writing. Finally, a one chapter section ends the book with some potpourri on ethics, teaching research, and sources. The book is 324 pages of text, but it is a quick read.
There were certain chapters that captured my interest. Chapter 2 on connecting with the reader was done nicely, with the authors highlighting that a research paper should develop a relationship with the reader. Not rocket science, but something that we researchers often forgot or forego. Chapter 7 addressed the important issue of making good arguments, outlining reasons, evidence, and relevance. Chapter 11 on warrants was a really fascinating adventure in the underlying assumptions that ground most research. A difficult topic for researchers, because we are so ingrained in our fields that we take the assumptions for granted. However, those outside our field do not. Therefore, we must always be ready to articulate the warrants of our research.

The book does have at least two shortcomings. One, it is tailored for those researchers who publish academic articles. There are a significant number of researchers for which publishing is not their primary goal.
Certainly The Craft of Research will be of help to them, but not as much as the  X  X  X raditional X  X  academic researcher. Two, the lack of familiarity by the authors with (or at least coverage of) the technological aids available to modern researchers was almost embarrassing. For example, the discussion of note taking and bib-liography construction with no mention of applications such Endnote is a serious omission. Another example is Chapter 15, Communicating Evidence Visually , which was a fine presentation at the design level. However, the lack of discussion of modern graphing applications (many of which are quite good) called into question everything the authors were trying to communicate.

These shortcomings aside, this book is now mandatory reading for my research students. I expect to refer to it frequently myself.

Memory Practices in the Sciences, Geoffrey C. Bowker. The MIT Press (2005). xi, 261 pp., $34.95, ISBN: 0-262-02589-2
How can a stone be regarded as an archive? In her manifesto of 1951, now finally available in English, Briet (1951, 7; 2006, 10) explained that if a stone is examined as evidence, it is as much a  X  X  X ocument X  X  as a text would be. Hj X rland (1997, p. 111) added that a stone, like any other document, would mean different things to different people, according to their interests and perspectives. Now Geoffrey Bowker puts it nicely: Stones lead a double life. On the one hand they just do what rocks do, ordinarily just sitting on or in the ground, but, when examined, they reveal the history of the earth:  X  X  X s objects they function in the world, and as archives they maintain traces of their own past. Thus a rock can be read as an object that constitutes part of the lithosphere, and equally as a document that contains its own history written into it: striations on the surface indicate past glaciations, strata indicate complex stories of deposition over time ...  X  X  (p. 36).
Memory Practices in the Sciences continues and extends the author X  X  examination of the cultural and the technical in the infrastructure and practice of science. The author says (p. 6) that the book is concerned with how scientists figure their own human and disciplinary past and also the past of whatever they are investigat-ing, but the content of the book is not easily summarized. It examines endless interplays between complex issues: time, memory, documentation, infrastructure, culture, and human agendas.

Time is complex, calibrated by events, calibrating events, and can be excluded from theories and closed systems.

Memory emerges differently in each occasion of recollecting. Bowker is concerned with memory, but he deals with recording and representation more than remembering and he is interested in the many ways in which, over time, descriptive documentation fails to support accurate or useful reconstruction of the past.
The word  X  X  X rchive X  X  is very widely used to include all surviving traces of, or concerning, the past. All archives are highly selective. Leaving traces is a situated rhetorical activity, more or less unsatisfactory for audiences in other, later situations. Interpretation requires contextualizing knowledge that is often not avail-able. Yet it is the imperfect archive of traces that alone can speak to us:  X  X  X he archive X  X  jussive force, then, operates through being invisibly exclusionary X  X  (p. 14).

Memory practices use classification and standardization for efficiency and effectiveness. Consequently, infrastructures filter knowledge of the past. Selective forgetting is a practical necessity and a political force.
Archive, memory, and classification are tightly linked:  X  X  X he tools that we have to think about the past with
