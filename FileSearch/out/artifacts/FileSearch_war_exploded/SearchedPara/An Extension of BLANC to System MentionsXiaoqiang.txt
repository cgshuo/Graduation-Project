 Coreference resolution aims at identifying natu-ral language expressions (or mentions) that refer to the same entity. It entails partitioning (often imperfect) mentions into equivalence classes. A critically important problem is how to measure the quality of a coreference resolution system. Many evaluation metrics have been proposed in the past two decades, including the MUC measure (Vilain et al., 1995), B-cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), CEAF (Luo, 2005) and, more recently, BLANC-gold (Recasens and Hovy, 2011). B-cubed and CEAF treat entities as sets of mentions and mea-sure the agreement between key (or gold standard) entities and response (or system-generated) enti-ties, while MUC and BLANC-gold are link-based.
In particular, MUC measures the degree of agreement between key coreference links (i.e., links among mentions within entities) and re-sponse coreference links, while non-coreference links (i.e., links formed by mentions from different entities) are not explicitly taken into account. This leads to a phenomenon where coreference systems outputting large entities are scored more favorably than those outputting small entities (Luo, 2005). BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, 2011), on the other hand, considers both coreference links and non-coreference links. It calculates recall, precision and F-measure separately on coreference and non-coreference links in the usual way, and defines the overall recall, precision and F-measure as the mean of the respective measures for coreference and non-coreference links.

The BLANC-gold metric was developed with the assumption that response mentions and key mentions are identical. In reality, however, men-tions need to be detected from natural language text and the result is, more often than not, im-perfect: some key mentions may be missing in the response, and some response mentions may be spurious X  X o-called  X  X winless X  mentions by Stoy-anov et al. (2009). Therefore, the identical-mention-set assumption limits BLANC-gold X  X  ap-plicability when gold mentions are not available, or when one wants to have a single score mea-suring both the quality of mention detection and coreference resolution. The goal of this paper is to extend the BLANC-gold metric to imperfect re-sponse mentions.
 We first briefly review the original definition of BLANC, and rewrite its definition using set nota-tion. We then argue that the gold-mention assump-tion in Recasens and Hovy (2011) can be lifted without changing the original definition. In fact, the proposed BLANC metric subsumes the origi-nal one in that its value is identical to the original one when response mentions are identical to key mentions.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the notions used in this paper in Section 2. We then present the original BLANC-gold in Section 3 using the set notation defined in Section 2. This paves the way to generalize it to imperfect system mentions, which is presented in Section 4. The proposed BLANC is applied to the CoNLL 2011 and 2012 shared task participants, and the scores and its correlations with existing metrics are shown in Section 5. To facilitate the presentation, we define the nota-tions used in the paper.

We use key to refer to gold standard mentions or entities, and response to refer to system mentions or entities. The collection of key entities is denoted accordingly, R = { r j } | R | entities, and r j is the j th response entity. We as-sume that mentions in { k i } and { r j } are unique; in other words, there is no duplicate mention.
Let C k ( i ) and C r ( j ) be the set of coreference links formed by mentions in k i and r j : As can be seen, a link is an undirected edge be-tween two mentions, and it can be equivalently represented by a pair of mentions. Note that when an entity consists of a single mention, its corefer-ence link set is empty.

Let N k ( i, j ) ( i 6 = j ) be key non-coreference links formed between mentions in k i and those in k j , and let N r ( i, j ) ( i 6 = j ) be response non-coreference links formed between mentions in r i and those in r j , respectively: Note that the non-coreference link set is empty when all mentions are in the same entity.

We use the same letter and subscription with-out the index in parentheses to denote the union of sets, e.g., We use T k = C k  X  N k and T r = C r  X  N r to denote the total set of key links and total set of response links, respectively. Clearly, C k and N k form a partition of T k since C k  X  N k =  X  , T k = C k  X  N k . Likewise, C r and N r form a partition of T .

We say that a key link l 1  X  T k equals a response link l 2  X  T r if and only if the pair of mentions from which the links are formed are identical. We write l 1 = l 2 if two links are equal. It is easy to see that the gold mention assumption X  X ame set of response mentions as the set of key mentions X  can be equivalently stated as T k = T r (this does not necessarily mean that C k = C r or N k = N r ).
We also use | X | to denote the size of a set. BLANC-gold is adapted from Rand Index (Rand, 1971), a metric for clustering objects. Rand Index is defined as the ratio between the number of cor-rect within-cluster links plus the number of correct cross-cluster links, and the total number of links.
When T k = T r , Rand Index can be applied di-rectly since coreference resolution reduces to a clustering problem where mentions are partitioned into clusters (entities): In practice, though, the simple-minded adoption of Rand Index is not satisfactory since the number of non-coreference links often overwhelms that of coreference links (Recasens and Hovy, 2011), or, | N k | | C k | and | N r | | C r | . Rand Index, if used without modification, would not be sensitive to changes of coreference links.

BLANC-gold solves this problem by averaging the F-measure computed over coreference links and the F-measure over non-coreference links. Using the notations in Section 2, the recall, pre-cision, and F-measure on coreference links are: Similarly, the recall, precision, and F-measure on non-coreference links are computed as: Finally, the BLANC-gold metric is the arithmetic that they are meant for coreference systems with gold mentions.

Eqn. (8) indicates that BLANC-gold assigns equal weight to F ( g ) c , the F-measure from coref-erence links, and F ( g ) n , the F-measure from non-coreference links. This avoids the problem that | N k || C k | and | N r || C r | , should the original Rand Index be used.

In Eqn. (2) -(3) and Eqn. (5) -(6), denominators are written as a sum of disjoint subsets so they can be related to the contingency table in (Recasens and Hovy, 2011). Under the assumption that T k = T , it is clear that C k = ( C k  X  C r )  X  ( C k  X  N r ) , C r = ( C k  X  C r )  X  ( N k  X  C r ) , and so on. Under the assumption that the key and response mention sets are identical (which implies that T k = T r ), Equations (2) to (7) make sense. For example, R c is the ratio of the number of correct coreference links over the number of key corefer-ence links; P c is the ratio of the number of cor-rect coreference links over the number of response coreference links, and so on.

However, when response mentions are not iden-tical to key mentions, a key coreference link may not appear in either C r or N r , so Equations (2) to (7) cannot be applied directly to systems with im-perfect mentions. For instance, if the key entities are { a,b,c } { d,e } ; and the response entities are { b,c } { e,f,g } , then the key coreference link (a,b) is not seen on the response side; sim-ilarly, it is possible that a response link does not appear on the key side either: (c,f) and (f,g) are not in the key in the above example.

To account for missing or spurious links, we ob-serve that the response; ing in the response; ing in the key; missing in the key, and we propose to extend the coreference F-measure and non-coreference F-measure as fol-lows. Coreference recall, precision and F-measure are changed to:
Non-coreference recall, precision and F-measure are changed to:
The proposed BLANC continues to be the arith-metic average of F c and F n : We observe that the definition of the proposed BLANC, Equ. (9)-(14) subsume the BLANC-gold (2) to (7) due to the following proposition: Proof . We only need to show that R c = R ( g ) c , P c = P the first one (the other proofs are similar and elided due to space limitations). Since T k = T r and C k  X  T k , we have C k  X  T r ; thus C k \ T r =  X  , and | C k  X  T r | = 0 . This establishes that R c = R
Indeed, since C k is a union of three disjoint sub-sets: C k = ( C k  X  C r )  X  ( C k  X  N r )  X  ( C k \ T r ) , R c and R c can be unified as for other component recalls and precisions can be done similarly. So the final definition of BLANC can be succinctly stated as: 4.1 Boundary Cases Care has to be taken when counts of the BLANC definition are 0. This can happen when all key (or response) mentions are in one cluster or are all singletons: the former case will lead to N k =  X  (or N r =  X  ); the latter will lead to C k =  X  (or C r =  X  ). Observe that as long as | C k | + | C r | &gt; 0 , F c in (18) is well-defined; as long as | N k | + | N r | &gt; 0 , F n in (18) is well-defined. So we only need to augment the BLANC definition for the following cases: (1) If C k = C r =  X  and N k = N r =  X  , then BLANC = I ( M k = M r ) , where I (  X  ) is an in-dicator function whose value is 1 if its argument is true, and 0 otherwise. M k and M r are the key and response mention set. This can happen when a document has no more than one mention and there is no link. (2) If C k = C r =  X  and | N k | + | N r | &gt; 0 , then BLANC = F n . This is the case where the key and response side has only entities consisting of singleton mentions. Since there is no coreference link, BLANC reduces to the non-coreference F-measure F n . (3) If N k = N r =  X  and | C k | + | C r | &gt; 0 , then BLANC = F c . This is the case where all mentions in the key and response are in one entity. Since there is no non-coreference link, BLANC reduces to the coreference F-measure F c . 4.2 Toy Examples We walk through a few examples and show how BLANC is calculated in detail. In all the examples below, each lower-case letter represents a mention; mentions in an entity are closed in {} ; two letters in () represent a link.

Example 1. Key entities are { abc } and { d } ; re-sponse entities are { bc } and { de } . Obviously, Therefore, C k  X  C r = { ( bc ) } , N k  X  N r = { ( bd ) , ( cd ) } , and R c = 1
Example 2. Key entity is { a } ; response entity is { b } . This is boundary case (1): BLANC = 0 .
Example 3. Key entities are { a }{ b }{ c } ; re-sponse entities are { a }{ b }{ d } . This is boundary case (2): there are no coreference links. Since Table 1: The proposed BLANC scores of the CoNLL-2011 shared task participants.
 we have
N k  X  N r = { ( ab ) } , and R n = 1 So BLANC = F n = 1
Example 4. Key entity is { abc } ; response entity is { bc } . This is boundary case (3): there are no non-coreference links. Since we have So BLANC = F c = 2 5.1 CoNLL-2011/12 We have updated the publicly available CoNLL and used it to compute the proposed BLANC scores for all the CoNLL 2011 (Pradhan et al., 2011) and 2012 (Pradhan et al., 2012) participants in the official track, where participants had to au-tomatically predict the mentions. Tables 1 and 2 5.2 Correlation with Other Measures Figure 1 shows how the proposed BLANC mea-sure works when compared with existing met-rics such as MUC, B-cubed and CEAF, us-ing the BLANC and F1 scores. The proposed BLANC is highly positively correlated with the Table 2: The proposed BLANC scores of the CoNLL-2012 shared task participants.

Figure 1: Correlation plot between the proposed BLANC and the other measures based on the CoNLL 2011/2012 results. All values are F1 scores. other measures along R, P and F1 (Table 3), showing that BLANC is able to capture most entity-based similarities measured by B-cubed and CEAF. However, the CoNLL data sets come from OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006), where singleton entities are not annotated, and BLANC has a wider dynamic range on data sets with singletons (Re-casens and Hovy, 2011). So the correlations will likely be lower on data sets with singleton entities. The original BLANC-gold (Recasens and Hovy, 2011) requires that system mentions be identical to gold mentions, which limits the metric X  X  utility since detected system mentions often have missing key mentions or spurious mentions. The proposed BLANC is free from this assumption, and we have shown that it subsumes the original BLANC-gold. Since BLANC works on imperfect system mentions, we have used it to score the CoNLL 2011 and 2012 coreference systems. The BLANC scores show strong correlation with existing met-rics, especially B-cubed and CEAF-m.
