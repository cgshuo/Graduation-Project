 Associations between drugs and targets are essential for understanding the phar-macology of drugs and for repositioning known drug [ 1  X  4 ]. Capturing associa-tions between drugs and targets using traditional biochemical experiments is a laborious and time-consuming procedure that is also very expensive [ 5  X  7 ]. One alternative is to compute potential associations between drugs and targets via bases [ 17  X  19 ] are three common computational approaches. Docking requires information about the 3D structure of a target/protein to calculate how well each drug candidate can bind with the target, but this type of information is missing for many targets, like GPCR and ion channel [ 20 , 21 ]. Moreover, dock-ing is computationally expensive, which makes it difficult to process large-scale datasets. Text mining approaches is heavily relied on domain dictionaries to deal with semantic ambiguity like aliases and synonyms in the literature [ 16 ]. Ligand-based approaches such as QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship) compare a candidate ligand with the known ligands of a target protein to pre-dict its bindings [ 17 , 18 ], and the performance of ligand-bases approach decreases when the number of known ligands is limited [ 19 ].
 Recently, machine learning methods has been shown to be effective in finding the drug-target interactions based on chemical properties of drug compounds, genomic properties of targets, and interaction profiles [ 22  X  27 ]. Those approaches share the identical assumption that similar drugs tend to interact closely with similar target proteins [ 28 , 29 ]. Existing studies utilized drug/target similarity information and known interactions to capture potentially novel interactions between drugs and targets. For instance, Jacob and Vert proposed a SVM-based method [ 30  X  32 ] called pairwise kernel method (PKM) to generate sim-ilarity kernels over drug-target pairs [ 27 ]. Yamanishi [ 22 ] proposed the kernel regression-based method (KRM) to infer unknown drug-target interaction in a unified space called  X  X harmacological space X . Yamanishi [ 23 ] proposed the bipar-tite graph inference (BLM) method, which builds a bipartite local model to pre-dict links between drugs and targets in a bipartite graph. Gonen [ 24 ]proposed Kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization (KBMF2K) to predict interactions by projecting drug compounds and target proteins onto a unified subspace via joint Bayesian formulation. Laarhoven [ 25 ] proposed a Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) method to predict drug-target interactions by generating a Gaussian ker-nel from interaction profiles and similarity information among drugs and among targets. Xia [ 26 ] proposed a NetLapRLS method by incorporating Laplacian reg-ularized least square (LapRLS) and a new kernel established from the known interaction network in a unified framework. Moreover, Wang and Zeng [ 33 ] built a restricted boltzmann machine (RBM) method to predict drug-target pairs and to describe types of predicted pairs.
 Some methods utilize similarity information and partial drug-target interac-tion profiles to predict potential interactions between drugs and targets. How-ever, similarity information might not be available in some cases. For example, it is extremely difficult to collect complete similarity information in large scale database like STITCH [ 34 ] and the 3D shape similarity of many proteins/targets, especially GPCRs are unavailable [ 21 , 35 ]. On the other side, drug similarity can be calculated based on different types of biological knowledge such as chemi-cal structure (CS), and anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system (ATC) [ 32 ], and target similarity can also be calculated from genomic sequence of similarity is the most appropriate one, as each measure has its private biochem-ical properties. Zheng [ 39 ] showed that the effect of the same type of similarity might vary dramatically on different datasets. For example, the GS similarity over target is very critical for predicting interactions on GPCR dataset, while it is almost useless on the nuclear receptor, ion channel and enzyme datasets. Therefore, integrating different similarity metrics is still a challenging problem. information. For example, Cheng [ 40 ] proposed a network-based inference (NBI) method to predict interactions by using the interaction profiles only. Moreover, Cobanoglu and Bahar etc. [ 41 ] assumed that all the samples obey the Gaussianly distributed probability to present probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) to predict pairs by only using the interaction profiles. Experiments demonstrate that the prediction of NBI is more reliable than drug-based similarity infer-ence (DBSI) and target-based similarity inference (TBSI), because choosing an improper similarity data may introduce extra noise to the model building process due to inaccurate selection of similar pairs. Although above mentioned methods exhibit a satisfactory AUC value (area under ROC curve) performance, its pre-cision and recall are still unsatisfactory.
 which uses the matrix completion for prediction based on only interaction infor-mation. Our method assumes that similar drugs often interact with similar pro-teins and converts the interaction prediction problem into a collaborative filtering problem, which infers missing entries in the interaction matrix by using known interactions. We evaluated our method by comparing with the existing methods and ten-fold cross-validation on a  X  X old standard X  datasets including enzyme, ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), nuclear receptor and inte-grated datasets. Experimental results show that our method achieves high per-formance in both AUC and F 1 -score, and validation of predicted pairs in the latest DrugBank and KEGG databases shows that our method is intelligible. 2.1 Drug-Target Interaction Databases In the drug-target interaction prediction literature, four datasets include enzyme, ion channels, GPCRs, and nuclear receptor are usually regarded as the  X  X old standard X  dataset [ 22  X  27 , 39 , 40 ]. In this study, we also combined them together to generate an integrated dataset for further verification. Yamanishi [ 22 ]pro-posed a widely used benchmark for drug-target interactions which includes four subsets for different types of targets: enzyme, ion channels, GPCRs and nuclear receptor. These datasets were collected from curated databases including KEGG BRITE [ 42 ], BERENDA [ 43 ], SuperTarget [ 44 ] and DrugBank [ 45 ], respectively. The numbers of drugs, targets and drug-target interactions are listed in Table 1 . We also generated an integrated dataset that combines all four subsets. The integrated data of these four datasets contains 5127 interactions between 989 target proteins and 791 drugs. 2.2 Motivation by Data Visualization To predict unknown interactions from the drug-target dataset, we first ana-lyze the  X  X old standard X  datasets. Due to drug-target interaction matrix is too sparse to difficult find some observations, we sorted the drug and target protein in descending order by their number of interactions to make figure. Figure 1 is an example to show the interaction matrix of the first fifty or twenty drugs/ target proteins based on sorted interactions in four datasets. From Fig. 1 (a), we can observe that many drugs have similar interactions, such as drugs #16 to #23 [KEGG:D00538, D00224, D00377, D00391, D00401, D01069, D00136, D00569], and drugs #28 to #34 [KEGG:D03778, D03781, D00947, D00963, D01397, D02441, D03776] have very similar interactions. The same observation can also be found from the target protein side in Fig. 1 (a). For instance, if a target protein has interactions from drugs #28 to #34, it may also have inter-action with drug #2 [KEGG:D00521], because there exists a strong relationship between drug #28 to #34 and drug #2. From the above observation, it is evi-dent that correlation does exist between node instances in the enzyme dataset. For instance, if a target has interactions with drug #28 to #34, then it has a high probability to interact with #2. The same phenomenon can also be observed on the other subsets. We also analyzed the most important part of the ion channel, nuclear receptor and GPCR subset and found the same observations in Fig. 1 (b), (c), and (d), respectively. In Fig. 1 (c), we only select the first twenty drug/target proteins from the nuclear receptor subset, as the interaction matrix size is a 56  X  26 matrix. From Fig. 1 (c) and (d), the observation is less evident compar-ing with Fig. 1 (a) and (b), but the same observation can still be found from tar-get proteins #9 to #13 [KEGG:hsa3174, hsa367, hsa4306, hsa5241, hsa5465] in Fig. 1 (c) and from drugs #10 to #13 [KEGG:D00136, D00139, D00180, D00225], and from target proteins #6 to #9 [KEGG:hsa1129, hsa1131, hsa1132, hsa1133] in Fig. 1 (d).
 contribute to the prediction of interactions. In other words, from the viewpoint of drugs, all drugs interact with the target proteins in a few patterns, and thus we can leverage the known interaction information to predict unknown interac-tions by predicting missing values of the interaction matrix. It is also true from the viewpoint of target proteins. It therefore motivates us to apply the matrix completion technique to the drug-target interaction prediction problem. 2.3 The Drug-Target Interaction Prediction Method The original interaction dataset needs to be pre-processed in order to apply the matrix completion. In the benchmark dataset, the value 1 denotes a con-firmed/annotated interaction (positive sample), while all other unknown drug-target pairs in the training data are assumed to be non-interacted (negative sample), which is denoted by the value 0. However, our method regards 0 val-ued entries as the ones to be predicted. Therefore, directly performing matrix completion on original dataset may lead confusion. So we fill non-interaction entries by one value a and interaction entries by another value b , where a = b and { a, b } = 0. Our method first fills missing entries with value 0 in the origi-nal matrix to be recovered by using the matrix completion, and then iteratively updates the missing entries with the predicted value.
 N t targets. The set X d = { t the known samples, and  X  the index set of the rest known samples. We formulate the interaction prediction problem as below: where f  X  ( X ) is a nonlinear function of candidate solution matrix X . P orthogonal projector, and P  X  ( X ) is equal to X ( i, j )if( i, j ) equal to zero otherwise. In matrix completion, the predicted matrix X is usually expected to be low-rank. We therefore rewrite ( 1 ) as the following problem to minimize the rank of X because nuclear norm of X is a convex surrogate of its rank: where X  X  signifies the nuclear norm of X which is actually the sum of singular value of matrix X ,and X F is the Frobernius norm of matrix X ,and  X  a thresholding which will be used in soft-thresholding operator.
 According to [ 46 ], the problem ( 2 ) can be optimized by using the Lagrangian multipler method. Specially, we introduce a Lagrangian multiplier Y and get the Lagrangian function of ( 2 ) as below: Applying the Uzawas algorithm [ 47 ] to find a saddle point of ( 3 ) until conver-gence.
 The Uzawas algorithm first updates X with Y fixed as followed by updating Y with X fixed as where {  X  k } k  X  1 is a sequence of step size, and the soft-thresholding operator D is defined as follows: Singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix X can obtain a sequence of positive singular values  X  i .And diag ( {  X  i  X   X  } + ) is the positive part of  X   X   X   X  is equal to zero, if  X  i  X   X &lt; 0. The physical meaning of soft-thresholding operator can be understood that it filters the data and only leaves the most important part of the dataset. Therefore, noise or redundancy information can be eliminated via the soft-thresholding operator. According to [ 42 ], the iterative method can converge to an unique solution when 0 &lt; X &lt; 2.
 The matrix completion method iteratively updates ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) until the stop-ping criteria is met. In this study, we choose the well-known K.K.T. condi-tions [ 48 ] as the stopping criteria: where is the predefined tolerance, e.g., 10  X  4 . 2.4 Performance Metrics We choose two metrics including AUC (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) and F 1 -score to evaluate the performance of our method. The ROC curve plots the values of TPR (true positive rate) versus FPR (false positive rate), and it is one of the well-known metrics to evaluate the perfor-mance of existing interaction prediction method in the current study. TPR and FPR are defined as: where TP, FP, TN, and FN denote true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative, respectively. However, AUC is insufficient to evaluate the perfor-mance of methods on bio-dataset because most bio-datasets have a highly imbal-anced class distribution between positive samples and negative samples [ 49 ]. For example, the enzyme dataset contains less than 1 % interaction entries (pos-itive samples) in the whole dataset and the remaining 99 % elements are non-interaction entries (negative samples). A naive prediction method that randomly predicts all elements as non-interaction entries can achieve a small false positive rate because most elements in original dataset are non-interaction entries. On the other hand, the true positive rate can be high even though we only find one correct interaction entry, because the number of real interaction is small. That is why existing prediction methods can easily achieve a decent of AUC about 80 % X 99 %. Practically speaking, the ability of predicting as many as potentially correct interactions can maximize the probability of validating the unverified interaction pairs via biochemical experiments. Since AUC is insufficient to eval-uate performance of model, F 1 -score is used as a standard information retrieval metric, to evaluate the performance of our method and its counterparts. The F score is defined based on two critical metrics including Precision and Recall, i.e. utilization of FPR. FPR mainly focus on the non-interaction prediction perfor-mance while the F 1 -score mainly focus on the overall interaction prediction per-formance. In general, precision represents the interaction prediction success rate. This section evaluates the effectiveness of our method in terms of both AUC and F 1 -score with 10-fold cross validation CV on  X  X old standard datasets X . In this experiment, we empirically set the step size = 1.5 and the stopping toler-ance = 10  X  4 . We compared our method to five representative methods including NBI [ 40 ], GIP [ 25 ], KBMF2K [ 24 ], PMF [ 41 ] and NetLapRLS [ 26 ] according to Hao X  X  review [ 49 ]. For GIP, KBMF2K, and NetLapRLS, we used the source codes provided by the authors; for NBI and PMF, we implemented the algo-rithm described in their paper. Note that GIP, KBMF2K and NetLapRLS need to exploit both similarity information and interaction profiles as input to pre-dict interactions. As the performance of NetLapRLS was verified in a slightly different way from the remaining methods, we first compared our method to NBI, GIP, KBMF2K, and then compared it against NetLapRLS separately in the next subsection. 3.1 Performance Comparison of NBI, GIP, KBMF2K, PMF and Our Method on Gold Standard Datasets One reason to use F 1 -score as the performance metric is that existing interaction datasets tend to exhibit an imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples, as illustrated in Table 1 . A large number of non-interaction entries make AUC insufficient for measuring the performance. On the contrary, the F -score penalizes false positives much more than ROC [ 49 , 50 ], and thus it can characterize the performance better in interaction prediction. Tables 2 and 3 list the AUC and F 1 -scores of NBI, PMF, GIP, KBMF2K and our methods on both  X  X old standard X  and integrated datasets, respectively. Table 2 shows that our method achieves the highest AUC value (around 0.97) on the enzyme, ion channel and the integrated datasets; and its AUC value is also good on the GPCR dataset (above 0.9). Table 3 demonstrates that our method has the highest F 1 -scores on all test sets except for the nuclear receptor subsets. Ion channel and integrate databases while it requires much less information comparing with the similarity-bases methods. Moreover our method has the higher AUC and F 1 value on most datasets comparing with the NBI and PMF methods. 3.2 Comparison with the NetLapRLs Method In this experiment, we compared the performance of our method against that of the NetLapRLS method. The main difference between NetLapRLS method and other methods is that the NetLapRLS method only utilizes known inter-actions entries (positive instances) for prediction, while the remaining methods treat unknown interaction as non-interactions (negative instances) in the train-ing data. We investigate the effects of introducing negative instances into the training data on the performance of our method and NetLapRLS methods. To do this, we performed a series of performance test by randomly adding 0 %, 10%,..., 90% ne gative samples into the training dataset. In each test, we per-formed 10-fold cross validation.
 uses positive samples to predict all unknown interaction entries like NetLapRLs. We can see from Figs. 2 and 3 that when the percentage of negative samples increases, both AUC and F 1 -score of our method can be gradually improved (especially for F 1 -scores). More importantly, we can clearly see that even if the AUC values are stable, the F 1 -score significantly improves. This also reflects the importance of including F 1 -score for performance evaluation. 4.1 Validated New Pairs in the Latest Databases In order to illustrate the capability of our method in the real case, we devel-oped a small tool [ 51 ] by Python that can automatically validate predicted links using the knowledge from DrugBank and KEGG. We decide the value of threshold when the F 1 score is the highest. If the prediction value is larger than the threshold, we regard it as candidate interaction, otherwise, non-interaction. Table 4 summaries the validation links in four datasets. According to Table 4 , the percentages of new validated interactions are 16 . 90 %, 17 . 24 %, 40 . 78 % and 22 . 22 % for enzyme, ion channel, GPCR and nuclear subsets datasets, respec-tively. Figure 4 shows two instances of new validated drug-target interactions we truly find them in the latest database. Both drugs D00691 and D00528 interact with the same target hsa5150 and both drugs D00563 and D00283 interact with the same target hsa152. We can find that D00691 has a similar chemical struc-ture with D00528, and D00563 has a similar chemical structure with D00283. Although our method does not apply any similarity information in the model, the result also reflects that the similar drugs tend to interact closely with similar target proteins. More materials are available at [ 51 ].
 4.2 Limitation Due to our method only utilized interaction profiles to mine potential inter-action, it requires only existing correlation between samples. In this work, we analysis four datasets and find some drugs have very similar interactions between targets. Therefore, we can fill the missing interaction entries based on observed interactions. Some biological missing value cannot be predicted by this method such as IC 50 ,EC 50 ,K i and K d value [ 52 ] in structure activity relationship (SAR) dataset because it does not have clear correlations between samples. Our method is the first work to predict drug-target interactions by using the matrix completion technique [ 2 ] based on the observation that most drug-target interaction matrices are low-rank. Our method first fills missing entries with 0 in the original matrix to be recovered, and it iteratively updates the missing entries with predictive value. Moreover, in extreme case, a strong drug-drug and target-target correlation makes the interaction matrix to a low-rank one. Therefore, our method tends to adopt the lowest-rank approximate matrix as the correct solution during the iterative process.
 Five representative models: NBI, PMF, GIP, KBMF2K, NetLapRLS are used for comparative study. Among them, GIP, KBMF2K and NetLapRLS apply interaction profiles as well as similarity information of drugs/target proteins. NBI,PMF and our method predict the interaction pairs only based on interaction information. Our method outperforms other methods in terms of both AUC and F -score. As there is no standard similarity strategy of bio-data, our method only applies interaction profiles to predict drug-target interactions. For future work, we will extend our method by introducing similarity learning on bio datasets.
