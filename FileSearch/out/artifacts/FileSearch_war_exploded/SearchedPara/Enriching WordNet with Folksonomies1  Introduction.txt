 WordNet [1] is a huge hand-built thesaurus and has been widely employed in many tasks. But with the fast emergence of new words in our times, WordNet may not be able to catch the fast pace of the changes of vocabularies, and its lack of new words apparently has become a more and more serious problem. Recently, Folksonomies ar e very popular web services and they allow annotators to use freely chosen strings as tags without any apriori thesaurus. A cursory analysis of the tags reveals that the tags can perfectly reflect the emergence of new words, most probably owing to the popularity of such services. But the shortcoming of Folksonomies is their unrestricted use of words and their flat structure, which obstructs their direct application.

This paper describes a method for semi -automatic enrichment of WordNet with Folksonomies. Our method aims to derive the emergent semantics of Folk-sonomies and places the new words found in Folksonomies to appropriate posi-tions in WordNet according to the subsumption relationships [2] extracted from Folksonomies. Although it is relatively simpler than more sophisticated meth-ods, the technique of subsumption itself has long been employed in constructing concept hierarchies and has achieved so me success [2]. In our preliminary exper-iment, the method appears to be effective.
 2.1 Folksonomies Social annotations are very popular in the past few years. What X  X  special is their use of keywords called  X  X ags X . These use r-created annotations were coined the name  X  X olksonomy X , a combination of  X  X olk X  and  X  X axonomy X  [3]. In our work, the most important strength of Folksono mies is that they directly reflect users X  vocabularies. Traditionally, dictionaries or thesauri can only represent the vocab-ularies of lexicographers, and there is a great gap between these two vocabularies. [4] recommends using Folksonomies as the start of professionally designed con-trolled vocabularies and also makes a good analogy between Folksonomies and  X  X esire lines X . Some early reviews on Fo lksonomies have been published [5,3,6]. [7] introduced the social dimension into a unified model of social networks and semantics. [8] gave a detailed analysis of annotation data in Delicious. [9,10] proposed to integrate Folksonomies with the Semantic Web. 2.2 Hyponym/Hypernym Relation Extraction The current automated approaches for Hyponym/Hypernym relation extraction are classified into two classes: 1). approaches based on lexical or syntactic analysis , which rely on the lexical or syntactic patterns to discover relation-ships between words in text. [11] described a method by use of lexico-syntactic patterns manually identified. [12] applied the pattern learning method to Part-Whole relations. [13] employed Formal Concept Analysis for a specific domain. 2). approaches based on co-occurrence distributions of words ,whichjust treat text as bag-of-words without depending on any syntactic features. [2] in-troduced a document-based definition of subsumption . We adopt the work to Folksonomies. [14,15] derived subsumption relations on text associated with im-age captions and descriptions. [16,17] employed subsumption to enhance effective browsing of social annotations. Folksonomy is usually formalized into a tripartite model [7], consisting of 3 corresponding to K users, N tags, and M web resources annotated. What interests us is the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags, which is defined as a set of triples ( user, resource, tag ). However, the tags in Folksonomies are unrestricted and in a single flat namespace. In this section, we describe the techniques for solving these problems in detail. 3.1 Tag Selection The tags in Folksonomies vary greatly in their quality, due to lack of control. After analyzing a large amount of tags, we conclude some causes of low quality:  X  No support for Hierarchies, e.g.  X  X oding.languages.php X ,  X  X oftware.os.linux X .  X  No support for Spaces, e.g.  X  X rogramminglanguage X ,  X  X osomethingwiththis X .  X  Numbers, Letters and other Index-like strings, e.g.  X 2004-10 X ,  X  X  X ,  X 1.11.05 X .  X  Personal Choices, e.g.  X  to read X ,  X   X 4 wednesday X ,  X  darren  X ,  X *temp X .
In order to filter out such tags of low quality, we take into consideration the consensus of users on a specific tag. The number of users who make annotation with the tag shows the degree to which the community reaches a consensus. This is analogous to common life: the more people the word is used by, the more likely it will appear in dictionaries. We find that the consensus of tag choices by users follow a power law distribution. In our dataset, 2283 tags are only used by one user, while only 2116 tags are shared by more than 20 users. We choose the number of 20 as tag selection thres hold. After tag selection, we regard the remaining tags to be of  X  X igh X  quality. The next subsection discusses how to relate these tags in a flat namespace to each other. 3.2 Subsumption Relationships The Hyponym/Hypernym relation is the most important one for the organization of WordNet. We aim to extract such relationship from co-occurrence of tags. The triples ( user, resource, tag ) are converted to a tag-by-resource matrix C n  X  m . Each row of C is a tag. Each column of C is a resource. C ij denotes the times of tag t i used to annotate resource r j . t x is said to subsume t y ,if t y is used to annotate a small portion of the resources that are annotated by t x . where  X  (0 &lt; X  1) denotes the relaxed subsumption threshold, f ( t y ) denotes the number of resources annotated with t y ,and f ( t x ,t y ) denotes the number of resources annotated with both t x and t y . Different  X  generates different number of Hyponym/Hypernym pairs. We set  X  to 0.8 conservatively, comparable to the value determined empirically by [2]. The last problem to be tackled is the issue of placing new words into the appropriate position in WordNet. 3.3 Enriching WordNet Words in WordNet are organized into sy nsets, which are the basic elements of WordNet. One word may be included in s everal synsets. The relations be-tween synsets include among others, Synonym, Hypernym, Hyponym, Meronym, Holonym, etc. To place new words in appropriate synsets, we define the similar-ity between a tag and a synset as sim ( synset, tag )=max w  X  synset  X  T f ( w, tag ), where f ( w, tag ) is defined in (3). It calculates the co-occurrence of the tag and the words appearing both in the tag set T and the synset. It could serve a measure of how close the tag is to the synset.

When comparing the Hyponym/Hypernym t 0 / t 1 pairs discovered by sub-sumption to the noun hierarchy of WordNet, 4 kinds of outcome are possible: 1. Both t 0 and t 1 are in WordNet. If the relationship is already in WordNet, it 2. t 0 is in, but t 1 is not present. For each Hypernym synset s of each sense of 3. t 1 is in, but t 0 is not present. This case is contrary to case 2. 4. Both t 0 and t 1 are not present. Initially, there may be many pairs in this In our experiment, WordNet 2.0 and the social bookmark service Delicious are used. We collected a sample of Delicious data, which consists of 479,035 annotation triples made by 29,221 users on 16,963 web resources with 8,445 distinct tags.
After tag selection, 2116 tags of high quality, i.e. shared by more than 20 users, are involved in subsumption checking. About 50% of them (1143 of 2116) are already in WordNet, and the others (973 of 2116) can be considered as good candidates for new words. By setting  X  to 0.8 in (1), we extracted 987 pairs of Hyponym/Hypernym relations. These pairs are divided into 4 cases discussed in Sect.3.3 (Table 1). It shows, after iter atively moved to other cases, only 1 pair remains in case 4 and is discarded without processing.

Evaluation presents a challenge, becaus e no objective standard exists. In pre-vious work, evaluation is usually conducted manually by human judges. In our work, we find that the tags already in WordNet could provide a good ground truth. So we conduct both objective and subjective evaluations. 4.1 Evaluation by WordNet For 274 subsumption pairs whose Hyponym and Hypernym are both in Word-Net already, 192 pairs ( precision 0.70) are found in WordNet. As for recall, Hyponym/Hypernym relations are tested pairwise between these 1143 tags, and 3231 relations are found. The recal l 0.06 is rather low, since most relations found in WordNet are too general to be extracted by co-occurrence. For example, in relation  X  X -shirt/object X ,  X  X bject X  is too general to be used with  X  X -shirt X  in De-licious, thus the relation could not be extracted by subsumption. By removing all relations whose Hypernym is too ge neral, the recall increases to 0.65. 4.2 Evaluation by Human Manual evaluation is only conducted on the subsumption pairs in which only Hyponym is registered (128 pairs), or in which only Hypernym is registered (584 pairs). Human judges mark each pair t 0 / t 1 by the type of relation between t 0 and t 1 . 4 options are provided:  X  X yponym/Hypernym X ,  X  X eronym/Holonym X ,  X  X ame X , and  X  X nknown X , in accordance with [2]. [2] applied subsumption to free text, and it provided us with a valuable baseline.

In general, the results are encouraging (Table 2). We notice that 19% of the relations are classified as  X  X nknown X  in baseline. By contrast, only 7% in aver-age are judged as  X  X nknown X  in our method. It shows the subsumption pairs produced from Folksonomies are relativ ely high quality, comp ared to those pro-duced from free text. We expect this to occur because when subsumption was used upon free text directly, a crucial s tep would be term selection. When sub-sumption is employed upon Folksonomies , however, the problem no longer exists. Users of Folksonomies undertake the task for us, i.e. choose the tags best sum-marizing the web resources, presumabl y better than any automated process. It justifies the effectiveness of adapt ing subsumption to Folksonomies. In this paper, we presented a method for enriching formal thesauri with informal Folksonomies. Traditional human-built thesaurus could not catch the pace of fast emergence of new words. On the other ha nd, Folksonomies are very popular web services recent years and are highly sensit ive to information dr ift and the change of users X  vocabularies. Our method selects tags of high quality, extracts the subsumption relation among them, and then places them into the appropriate synsets in WordNet. Through preliminary experiment, we show that our method is effective.
