 VANETs (vehicular ad-hoc networks) are gaining significant prominence from b oth components namely RSU (Road-Side Unit), OBU (On-Board Unit), and an appropriate network (such as Dedicated Short Range Communications, denotes DSRC, TCP/IP, etc) to coordinate with the whole system. VANETs aim to enhance the safety and efficiency of road traffic through the V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) and V2V (Vehicle benefits it would offer for future users, VANETs are receiving significant prominence from academia and industry in recent years. 
VANETs enable useful Intelligent Transportation System functionalities such as environment on the road. However, it also faces serious security threats about privacy preservation, because of its high privacy sensitivity of drivers, its huge scale of vehicle communication scheme should be introduced in VANETs. Besides the basic vehicle non-repudiation, etc.), a good privacy preserving scheme for VANETs must have low computational/communication complexity, lo w communication/storage load, as well as an efficient accountable/traceable mechanism. design rationale and details of our scheme. Then, the security and efficiency analysis related work in Section 6. Finally, we will give conclusion in Section 7. 2.1 System Model We consider our VANETs system model as shown in Fig. 1. real identity of a safety message sender by checking the trace table T 1 in local. To the and the DoT cannot be compromised and is fully trusted by all parties in the system. submitted trace log from RSUs periodically. coming from the DoT/OBUs. RSUs connect to DoT /DoA by a wired network and communicate with OBUs through DSRC. As a distributed unit is deployed on the behalf of either the OBU or the DoT/DoA. RSUs have hierarchical security because of the real environment secure threats. RSUs are divided into HRSU and LRSU, and are deployed in 1-HRSU-n-LRSU mode. HRSU inserts a message-related trace entry into the trace log while LRSU attaches trace Tag on the message. HRSU has to submit the trace log to DoA by secure way periodically. with each other to share local traffic information and improve the driving experience. If necessary, OBUs can also communicate with RSU to exchange some information. A authorized parties. 2.2 Secure Objectives We define the security requirements for our VANETs security scheme, and will show the fulfillment of these requirements after presenting the design details. profiling. bogus message will be identified and be punished. fundamental requirements, namely, authentication, non-repudiation and message integrity, to protect the system against unauthorized-message injection, denial of message disseminations and message alteration, respectively. Non-repudiation also violated the law or misbehaved. 3.1 System Initialization manner, and registers vehicles and RSU s. master secret * 2) DoA-KeyGen: DoT randomly select * corresponding public key DoA P DoA + X  =  X  . DoT sends the pair ( , DoA DoA + X  ) to DoA by secure channel, and sends DoA + to all the RSUs by secure channel. 3) RSU-KeyGen: DoT randomly select * Rq RSU K Z  X   X  for every RSU, and computes the corresponding public key RSU RSU KKP + X  =  X  . DoT sends the pair 
KK + X  ) to the target RSU by secure channel. 4) OBU-KeyGen: Suppose every vehicle has a unique real identity, denote RID. Vehicle V i first randomly chooses * store the entry [, , ] iii KRIDPID + in the trace table T 1 . 3.2 Group Construction The group construction includes the following 3 procedures: 1) RSU-Hello: RSU broadcasts Hello-Message periodically to show its existence for the near vehicle. Hello-Message is [] RSU K + . 2) OBU-Join-Req: After received the Hello-Message from RSU j , Vi sends back a and RSU j . The OBU-Join-Req Algorithm is shown as following. Confirm-Message include the group key G j and other configuration back. The RSU-Confirm Algorithm is shown as following.
 3.3 Message Sending signature by the OBU . The message ID defines the message type, and the payload field may include the information on the vehicle X  X  position, direction, speed, traffic events, event time, and so on. A timestamp is used to prevent the message replay attack. The fields are signed by the vehicle V i , by which the  X  X ignature X  field can be derived. Table IV specifies the suggested length for each field. encrypts and sends it to RSU j . The OBU-Message algorithm is shown in as Table 5. 3.4 Message Transfering After receiving a valid signature from the vehicles, RSU j anonymizes the message and broadcasts the anonymous message to the group member. According to the secure two different algorithm. by DoA. The transfer algorithm of HRSU is shown as Table 6. in them are not secure enough. The transfer algorithm of LRSU is shown as Table 7. 3.5 Message Verification 3.6 Trace If a message is found to be fraudulent, a tracing operation is started to determine the following two conditions: 1) If [ || || || || ( || || || ) || ] 2) If [ || || || || ( || || || )] 4.1 Privacy while are still able to authenticate the sender. 4.2 Traceability eventual tracing misbehaving vehicles. The tracking procedure executed by corporation between DoA and DoT guarantees the traceability. 4.3 Authentication, Non-Repudiation and Integrity message integrity can be protected by utilizing HMAC both in HRSU-Transfer and LRSU-Transfer Algorithm. HAB[1,2], GSB[3] and ECPP[4]. 5.1 Storage resource-abundant in nature. We are mainly concerned with the storage cost in vehicles means the anonymous certification number from each RSU which depends on the density of RSUs .): 5.2 Communication This section compares the communication overheads of the protocols studied. We assume that all protocols generate a timestamp to prevent replay attacks so we exclude the length of the timestamp in this analysis. 
In HAB, each message generates yields 181 bytes as the additional overhead due to cryptographic operations. In GSB, each message generates 197 bytes as the additional overhead. For ECPP protocols, the additional communication overhead is 42+147=189 bytes, where the first term represents the signature X  X  length, the second term represents the length of the anonymous key and its corresponding certificate. For RGH, the additional communication overhead is 2+21+20=43 bytes. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the overall communication overhead in 1 our protocol has much lower communication overhead than the other protocols. Security and privacy in VANETs raise many challenging research issues and there are preserving. 
Raya et al . [1,2] investigated the privacy issue and proposed a landmark pseudonym-based protocol (huge anonymous public keys based, denote HAB) employing the public key infrastructure (PKI). A huge number of private keys (about 43,800) and their corresponding anonymous certificates are preload into each OBU by authorized department. To sign each launched message, a vehicle randomly selects requirement. Although HAB protocol can effectively meet the conditional privacy compromised certificate to its owner X  X  identity is huge. To address the revoking issue, the authors later proposed three credential revocation protocols tailored for VANETs, namely RTPD, RC 2 RL, and DRP [7]. All the three protocols seem to work well under conventional PKI. However, the authors also proposed to use frequently updated anonymous public keys to fulfill users X  requirement on identity and location privacy. However, if HAB is used in conjunction with RC 2 RL and DRP, the CRL will become huge in size, rendering the revocation protocols highly inefficient. signed using the group signature scheme without revealing any identity information to vehicle has to spend additional time on safety message verification. Furthermore, when requires every remaining vehicle to calculate a new private key and group public key based on the exhaustive list of revoked vehicles whenever a vehicle is revoked. Lin et explored and represents an important obstacle to the success of this scheme. (ECPP) based on generating on-the-fly short-lived anonymous keys for the communication between vehicles and RSUs. ECPP used RSUs as the source of certificates. In such an approach, RSUs (as opposed to OBUs) check the group OBUs then use a RSU provided certificate to achieve authenticity and short-term linkability. However, ECPP is vulnerable to Sybil attacks and requires an unreasonable amount of computation for RSUs (i.e., linear in the size of the revocation information for every certificate request). In this paper, a lightweight RSU-aided group-based Hierarchical privacy-protecting protocol for VANETs has been proposed. The communication group is formed based on RSU and can provide anonymous communication between the group member vehicles LRSU, and are deployed in 1-HRSU-n-LRSU mode. HRSU inserts a message-related trace entry into the trace log while LRSU attaches trace Tag on the message. HRSU has to submit the trace log to DoA by secure way periodically. Furthermore, the scheme can preserve vehicle privacy, and simultaneously provide traceability. The protocol is characterized as low-complexity, low-load, efficient and accountable. Analysis about the security and the performance shows it can match the objectives well. Acknowledgments. This work was supported in part by the NSFC under grant No. 61170263 and No. 61003230.
