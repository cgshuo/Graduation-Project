This section introduces an arti fi cial creature, AnyRobot [22,23] and the novel concepts of the arti genome and the genetic robot are proposed through AnyRobot in a mobile phone. 2.1.

Internal state module
Homeostasis includes three states: fatigue, hunger and drowsiness. Emotion includes and neutral. In general, the number of internal states depends on an arti vector. For instance, motivation vector M is de fi ned as state is updated by k th state, and  X  k is the k th state gain. Update equations are de 2.1.3. Behavior selection module 1.

Each step is described in detail as follows: follows: where z represents the number of behaviors. v tr , r =1,  X  are the behavioral weight matrices connecting motivation and homeostasis to behaviors, respectively. the matrix is de fi ned as diagonal matrix with diagonal entries q is the masking value, and 0  X  q r a (  X  )  X  1.
