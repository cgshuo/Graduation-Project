 Virtual worlds are computer-simulated spaces which allow a large number of users to interact in real-time through an array of communication modes. The social and participatory nature of virtual worlds provide new places of assembly and generate opportunities for forming groups in which users can share information and engage in joint activities, potentially leading to a range of learning outcomes. The purported benefits are especially evident in user-created virt ual worlds such as Second Life  X  (http://secondlife.com ). Given the possibilities that virtual worlds may have for information sharing and learning, there is a need to understand these relativ ely new environments and the activities within them. This study adopts an ethnography of three social groups in Second Life over a nine-month period, employing methods such as pa rticipant observation and semi-structured interviews. Specifically, it seeks to examine information sharing within the gr oups and investigate the extent to which members learn from the group X  X  activities.

Second Life (SL) is observed to be one of the most popular virtual worlds currently [1]; [2]). Unlike some virtual worlds which are game-based and contain narratives, SL has no such features. Rather, SL is inherently a social world which allows users to interact freely with each other. As an open and communal social platform, it encourages the form ation and development of groups whose members share the same interest or simply like to engage in discussion or activities with others. These may include role-playing groups, drama groups, book cl ubs and cultural groups etc. Every SL member can join up to 25 groups at any one time, though group membership is not always free. Another feature of SL is its ability to create user c ontent. This could further support the group is formally structured or not. The first group is an educators group which is affiliated to a formal Educational organization in the United States and is managed by a Higher Education Institution also in the US; the second group is a science group which is founded by a science enthusiast and is partially associated with a formal Scien ce organization, although it is not funded by the organization; and finally, the third group is a philosophy group which was started by a group of participants who first met in SL, and have fo rmed links with one another due to a common interest in philosophy . One of them has since taken up the role of the instructor, and leads the group in the discussion. This group has no affiliation to any group in the real physical world. All of these three groups hold weekly events for their members (as well as non-members) and have done so since 2008. In order to understand the characteristics of groups, their practices and how people construct knowledge from such practices, it is necessary to study them in naturalistic settings where the "phenomenon of interest unfold naturally" [12]. To do this, an ethnographic approach is appropriate as it enables group processes and the ways in which people share information to be documented and examined in deta il over a considerable amount of time, and in their naturalistic settings. This emphasis on natural settings derives in part from a belie f that particular behaviors such as information sharing can only be understood in the everyday context in which they occur [13]. Further, adopting an ethnographic approach allows me to capitalize on the participatory and immersive nature of SL. I would be able to participate in the group events and engage with members over a considerable period. In doing so, I could uncover data which would otherwise be inaccessible by alternative methodologies. I am employing several data coll ection methods in the nine-month ethnographic study. These include participant observation and semi-structured interviews. The data consisting of chat logs, field notes, interview transcripts, obser vation notes, and video data will be analyzed through an iterative and circular process of describing, connecting and classify ing data as suggested by Miles and Huberman [14]. They explain the three stages of qualitative data analysis as follows: 1) da ta reduction which will help in sharpening, sorting, discarding a nd organizing the data; 2) data display which involves worki ng on the reduced data and displaying it so that emerging themes and patterns can be found; 3) conclusion drawing and ve rification where patterns, regularities are observed, and possible explanations can be made. This study hopes to contribute to the current literature on virtual worlds, as well as to provide a means in assessing the potentials of virtual worlds as learning spaces. The outcome will hopefully allow us to understand 1) how pe ople with similar interest can form groups in a virtual environment; 2) how, in fulfilling the function of the groups, do people interact and exchange information; and 3) how can this information exchange lead to learning. Finally, I also hope to determine whether the characteristics of the groups have a bearing on members X  learning outcomes. As Bainbridge (2010) s uggests, the concept of virtual worlds is already a major soci o-technical phenomenon, but their
