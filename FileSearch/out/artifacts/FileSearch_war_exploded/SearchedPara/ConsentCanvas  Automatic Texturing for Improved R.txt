 Less than 2% of users read End-User License Agreement (EULA) documents when indicating their consent to the software installation process (Good et al., 2007). While these documents often serve as a user X  X  sole direct interaction with the legal terms of the software, they are usually not read, as they are presented in such a way as is di-vorced from the use of the software itself (Fried-man et al., 2005). To address this, Kay and Terry (2010) developed what they call Textured Consent agreements which employ a linked stylesheet to augment salient parts of a EULA document. Unlike summarization-driven approaches to usable securi-ty, this is achieved without any modification of th e underlying text, minimizing the cognitive and legal burden for both the end user and the licensor and removing the need to make available a supplemen-tary unmodified document (Kelley et al, 2009; Far-zindar, 2004). We have developed a system, ConsentCanvas, for automating the creation of a Textured Consent document from an unstructured EULA based on the example XHTML/CSS template provided by Kay and Terry (2010; Figure 1). Our system does not currently use any complex syntactic or seman-tic information from the source document. Instead, it makes use of regular expressions and correlation functions to identify variable-length relevant phrases (Kim and Chan, 2004) to alter the docu-ment X  X  structure and appearance. We report on ConsentCanvas as a work in pro-gress. The system automates the labour intensive manual process used by Kay and Terry (2010). ConsentCanvas has a working implementation, but has not yet been formally evaluated. We also pre-sent the first available implementation of Kim and Chan X  X  algorithm (2004). patterns of lexical co-occurrence and distribution in order to impose topic boundaries on a document. ConsentCanvas uses the NLTK implementation of the TextTiling algorithm. Segmentation was not applied to the entire document (doing this resulted in a messy layout incoherent with structuring ap-plied by headers and titles). Instead, we used it t o identify the lead paragraph of the document, which was rendered differently using the  X  X ead para-graph X  container in the template. Future versions will use a more modern segmenting algorithm. 2.5 Header Extractor The header extractor module uses regular expres-sions to match any section header-like text from the original document. Several different search strings were used to catch multiple potential heade r types, including but not limited to: 2.6 Rendering Each analysis submodule produces a list of charac-ter positions where found items begin and end. These are passed to our rendering system, which inserts the corresponding HTML5 tags at the posi-tions in original plaintext EULA. We append a header to the output document to include the linked stylesheet per HTML5 specifications. We conducted a brief qualitative analysis on Con-sentCanvas after implementation and debugging. However, the problem space and system are not yet ready for formal verification or experimenta-tion. More exploration and refinement are required before we will be able to empirically determine if we have improved readability and comprehension. 3.1 Corpus We conducted our analysis on a small sample of EULAs from the same collection used by Lavesson et al. (2008) in their work on the classification o f EULAs. There were 1021 EULAs in this corpus divided into 96  X  X ad X  and 925  X  X ood X  examples. We used the  X  X ood X  examples for our analysis. 3.2 Variable-Length Phrase Finding Results Variable-Length Phrases (VLPs) were reasonably effective. In several of the best examples of text ur-ized EULAs security concerns were highlighted; in the texturized version of one document, the pull quote was  X  X n media, ICONIX, Inc. warrants that such media is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase as evi-denced by a copy of the receipt. ICONIX, Inc. war-rants. X  In the same EULA, other VLPs proved helpful:  X  X  that ICONIX, Inc. is free to use any ideas, concepts, X   X (except one copy for backup purposes), X  and  X  X nc. ICONIX, Inc. does not col-lect any personally identifiable information regard -ing senders. X  Some phrases have incomplete words at the beginning and end; this is an artifact of a known but unfixed bug in the implementation, not a result of the algorithm. However, these results were mixed in other EU-LAs. Several short but frequent phrases were found to be VLPs, such as  X  X nc., X  in the same EULA. In short licenses consisting of only one to three para -graphs, sometimes no relevant VLPs were discov-ered. There are also many phrases that should be highlighted that are not. 3.3 Preliminary System Evaluation We conducted an informal evaluation in which our system applied texture to 15 documents chosen from our corpus at random. Of these, five were determined to be highly readable exemplar docu-ments. An excerpt from one of these is shown in Figure 4. Of the remaining ten documents, four had poorly selected header markup but were otherwise satisfactory, two were too short or poorly-structured to benefit from the insertion of header markup, two did not perform well on the VLPF step, and two had several errors which appeared to have been caused by the use of non-ASCII charac-ters in the original document. The pull quote text was nearly unintelligible in almost all cases, due largely to the fact that it d id not split evenly on sentence borders. We did not le t this detract from our evaluation of the documents, because performance in this area was so consist-ently, and charmingly, poor, but did not affect readability of the main document body. Our preliminary analysis has provided several in-sights into the challenges and next steps in accom-plishing this task. 4.1 Comparisons with Kay and Terry Kay and Terry (2010) make reference to  X  X ug-menting and embellishing X  the document text  X  specifically not altering the original content. How-ever, their example document is written concisely in a user-friendly voice dissimilar to most formal EULAs found in the wild. Their work provides a strong proof of concept, but a key line of investig a-tion will be whether their approach is practical, o r whether some preprocessing is necessary to simpli-fy content. 4.2 Handling Legal Language We had anticipated a considerable amount of diffi-culty in selecting meaningful phrases from diffi-cult-to-understand legal language in the source document. However, most documents were found to contain a number of high-frequency VLPs with both layperson-salient legal terminology and common clues to document structure. 4.3 Future Work ConsentCanvas is fully implemented but offers many opportunities for improvement as the task becomes better understood. The variable-length phrase finding module only incorporates a single correlation function. More will be added, drawing in particular from those documented by Kim and Chan (2004). Machine learning techniques might also be used to classify phrases as relevant or not , leading to better-emphasized content. The rhythm of emphasized phrasing is also im-portant. In the example license designed by Kay and Terry (2010), there are one or two emphasized phrases in each section. The phrases found by ConsentCanvas are often sporadic, clustering in some sections and absent from others. As a result of this, readability suffers, and so we may need to look into possible stratification of VLPs. This might also aid multi-lingual documents, of which there are a few examples (a cursory look showed the results in French were comparable to those in English in a bilingual EULA in our corpus). Contact information is currently emphasized in the same manner as salient phrases. We plan to even-tually embed hyperlinks for all URLs and email addresses found in the source document, as in Kay and Terry (2010). The segmenter module uses the basic TextTiling algorithm with default parameters. More recent approaches could be implemented and could act on more than the lead paragraph. For example, coher-ent sections of long EULAs might be identified and presented as separate containers. We plan to improve header extractor providing more sophisticated regular expressions; we found that a wide variety of header styles were used. In particular, we plan to consider layouts that use di g-its, punctuation, or inconsistent capitalization in multiple instances in the document body. There is currently no module that incorporates the  X  X arning X  box from Kay and Terry (2010). This module would be designed to select relevant multi-line blocks of text by using techniques similar to the variable-length phrase finder or the segmenter. ConsentCanvas will also be extended to support command-line parameters. This will enable cus-tomized texturing of EULAs and facilitate experi-mentation for understanding and evaluating gains in comprehension and readability. Finally, we will conduct a formal user evaluation of ConsentCan-vas. We have provided a description of the work in progress for ConsentCanvas, a system for automat-ically adding texture to EULAs to improve reada-bility and comprehension. Informal analysis revealed several key challenges in accomplishing this task and identified the next steps towards ex-ploring effective solutions to this problem.
