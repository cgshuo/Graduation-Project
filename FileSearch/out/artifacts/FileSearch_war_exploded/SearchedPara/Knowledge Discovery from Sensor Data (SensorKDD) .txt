 Wide-area sensor infrastructures, remote sensors, R FIDs, and wireless sensor networks yield massive volumes of d isparate, dynamic, and geographically distributed data. As su ch sensors are becoming ubiquitous, a set of broad requirements is beginning to emerge across high-priority applications including adaptability to climate change, electric grid monitoring, disaster preparedness and management, national or homeland security, and the management of critical infrastructures. The raw dat a from sensors need to be efficiently managed and transformed to u sable information through data fusion, which in turn must be converted to predictive insights via knowledge discovery, ult imately facilitating automated or human-induced tactical de cisions or strategic policy based on decision sciences and dec ision support systems. Keeping in view the requirements of the emerging fi eld of knowledge discovery from sensor data, we took initi ative to develop a community of researchers with common inte rests and scientific goals, which culminated into the organiz ation of SensorKDD series of workshops in conjunction with t he prestigious ACM SIGKDD International Conference of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. In this report , we summarize events at the Third ACM-SIGKDD Internatio nal Workshop on Knowledge Discovery form Sensor Data (SensorKDD 2009). As wide-area sensor infrastructures, remote sensors , RFIDs, and wireless sensor networks are becoming ubiquitous, t he challenges for the knowledge discovery community are expected to be immense. On the one hand, dynamic data streams or e vents require real-time analysis methodologies and system s, while on the other hand centralized processing through high end computing is also required for generating offline predictive insights, which in turn can facilitate real-time analysis. The online and real-time knowledge discovery imply immediate opportunities a s well as intriguing short-and long-term challenges for prac titioners and researchers in knowledge discovery. The opportuniti es would be to develop new data mining approaches and adapt tra ditional and emerging knowledge discovery methodologies to the r equirements of the emerging problems. In addition, emerging soc ietal problems require knowledge discovery solutions that are designed to investigate anomalies, hotspots, changes, extrem es and nonlinear processes, and departures from the normal . The theme for the 2009 SensorKDD workshop is around three int er-related global priorities: climate change, energy assurance, and infrastructural impacts . The workshop brings together researchers from academia, government, and the industry working in various aspects of knowledge discovery from sensor data. The expected ubiquity of sensors in the near future , combined with the critical roles they are expected to play i n high priority application solutions, point to an era of unprecede nted growth and opportunities. The requirements described earlier i mply immediate opportunities as well as intriguing short -and long-term challenges for practitioners and researchers in kno wledge discovery. In addition, the knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) community would be called upon, again and aga in, as partners with domain experts to solve critical appl ication solutions in business and government, as well as in the domai n sciences and engineering. The main motivation for this workshop stems from th e increasing need for a forum to exchange ideas and recent resea rch results, and to facilitate collaboration and dialog between academia, government, and industrial stakeholders. Based on t he positive feedback from the previous workshop attendees and o ur own experiences and interactions with the government ag encies such as the United States Department of Energy, United S tates Department of Homeland Security, United States Depa rtment of Defense, and involvement with numerous projects on knowledge discovery from sensor data, we strongly believe in the continuation of this workshop. We also believe that the ACM SIGKDD conference is the right forum to organize th is workshop as it brings the KDD community together in this imp ortant area to establish a much needed leadership position in rese arch and practice in the near term, as well as in the long t erm. The previous two workshops  X  SensorKDD X 07 and SensorKDD X 08  X  held in conjunction with the 13 th and 14 SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data M ining respectively attracted several participants as well as many high quality papers and presentations. The 2007 worksho p was attended by more than seventy registered participan ts. The workshop program includes presentations by authors of six accepted full papers and four invited speakers. Th e invited speakers were Prof. Pedro Domingos of the Universit y of Washington, Prof. Joydeep Ghosh of the University o f Texas, Austin, Prof. Hillol Kargupta of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Dr. Brian Worley of the Oak R idge National Laboratory (ORNL). There were also poster presentations by authors of six accepted short pape rs. The extended versions of papers presented at the worksh op were developed into a book titled Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data [1], the first book published in this specific disc ipline. The 2008 workshop was attended by more than 60 regi stered participants. There were presentations by authors of seven accepted full papers and six accepted short papers; the workshop program also include presentations by two invited s peakers  X  Prof. Jiawei Han of the University of Illinois at U rbana-Champaign and Dr. Kendra Moore of the Defense Advan ced Research Projects Agency . The extended versions of papers presented at the 2008 workshop are scheduled for pu blication as Springer's LNCS post-proceedings in 2009. The highlights of the SensorKDD 2009 workshop are o ral presentations of accepted papers, presentations by invited speakers, and oral presentations by the winners of the first SensorKDD Cup, similar in spirit to the KDD Cup, bu t in line with the workshop theme. Based on a minimum of two reviews per paper, we sel ected six full paper and eight short papers. In addition to the oral presentations of accepted papers, the workshop feat ured three invited speakers: Dr. Aurelie Lozano of IBM T.J. Wa tson Research Center, Mr. Alessandro Donati of the Europ ean Space Agency, Darmstadt, Germany, and Prof. Carlos Guestr in of Carnegie Mellon University. For the SensorKDD Cup, we challenged contestants with intriguing problems alo ng with geographically distributed and dynamic data fr om sensors and model simulations. The datasets were provided a nd/or compiled by leveraging the Oak Ridge National Labor atory resources. Two winners were selected to present the ir results at the workshop. All papers presented at the workshop are available in [2]. Below is a list of accepted full papers and their r espective authors: The following is a list of accepted short papers an d their respective authors: The titles and authors of the SensorKDD X 09 Cup winn ers are: Extracting knowledge and emerging patterns from sen sor data is a nontrivial task. The challenges for the knowledge d iscovery community are expected to be immense. As evidenced from the participation and quality of submissions to the pre vious three SensorKDD workshops, it is clear that the  X  X nowledg e Discovery from Sensor Data or SensorKDD X  is a growing area an d an important specialty (sub-area) within knowledge dis covery. The SensorKDD workshop is proven to be an attractive fo rum for the researchers from academia, industry and government, to exchange ideas, initiate collaborations and lay foundation t o the future of this important and growing area. The workshop witne ssed lively participation from all quarters, generated interest ing discussions immediately after each presentation and as well as at the end of the workshop. All participants agreed for continued patronage for the SensorKDD workshop. In addition to the ACM work shop proceedings, extended papers will be published as p ost workshop proceedings in Springer's well-known  X  X ecture Notes in Computer Science X  series. The SensorKDD X 09 workshop was sponsored by the Geog raphic Information Science and Technology (GIST) Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Computational Sciences and Engineering (CSE) Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , and Cooperating Objects Network of Excellence (CONET).
