In this paper, a new clustering algorithm based on Mechanics (CABM) is than those of CURE and K-means. evaluate the experimental results upon CURE, K-Means and CABM in section 4. And finally, the paper is concluded in section 5. Clustering is the problem of grouping data objects based on similarity. the ith cluster of P . proposed a method to evaluate the quality of clustering algorithms as follows. 
C . The inner-cluster similarity is measured by || || | | quality of a clustering division is computed as: The smaller Q is, the higher clustering quality is achieved. data space. The gravitation between each pair of particles is defined as follows: denoted by 0 G , then the gravitation between i o and j o is 2 surface of a pole by A. denoted by E  X  X  = . 
 X  . Then the pole X  X  stress is = FA  X  and the strain is set is achieved. 3.1 Pre-processing CABM adopts the same processing method as CURE (see [1]): than n [16] , thus in this paper  X  tn = .  X  , 
Secondly, select towards the barycenter with a given contracted factor jv  X   X  L is the jth delegation node of i R whose coordinate is radius of k R . Definition 5. Let cr the candidate cluster i R is an isolated region , and if ji pR study objects of CABM algorithm. 3.2 Building the Trussing Structure nodes . cluster. trussing structure is built and the forces are computed. 3.3 The Analysis and Computation of the Trussing Structure follows: structure shown in Fig. 1 is:  X =

Now we give some related geometric definitions. polyhedron is called boundary vector . boundary polyhedron. The projection of ' vv noted as 12 , ee wise direction. n relocated into other clusters, we show how to do this in the next sub-section. 3.4 Delegation Node Relocation considered. potential energy under the deformation is the minimum [17,18] . energy minimum. clusters so that the potential energy of the structure is the minimum. should be relocated into the one which makes the potential energy minimum. candidate clusters, and the clustering result is stable. 3.5 Original Data Object Labeling See algorithm 1 for the whole process of CABM. 3.6 Performance Analysis iteration is Ok nk t  X  , in which t is the iterative time. We compare the performances of CABM, K-Means and CURE through two series of experiments in this session. The experiments were conducted on Windows 2000. We points and the potential energy of the trusses. 4.1 Clustering Results on the Same Data Sets [0,10] X [0,10] as Fig. 3(a) shows. Fig. 3(b). Through the process of CABM, the number of candidate clusters decreases K-Means and CURE have weak abilities than CABM to explore concave regions. 
Fig. 4 represents the relationship between the number of nodes moving among the faster than CURE and K-Means. It follows that CABM is more efficient than CURE and K-Means. 4.2 Clustering Results on Different Data Sets = L . We use Q introduced in section 2 to evaluate the quality of QQQ &lt; . This indicates that the qualities of the clustering results of CABM are better than those of CURE and K-Means. algorithm and trying other mechanical models.
