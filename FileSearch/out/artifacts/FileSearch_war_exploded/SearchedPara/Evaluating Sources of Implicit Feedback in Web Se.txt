 The study investigates the relationship between the types of behavior that can be captured from Web searches and searchers X  interests. Web search cases wh ich involve underspecification of information needs at the beginning and modification of search strategies during the search process will be collected and examined by human analysts. The study focuses on identifying the rules used by analysts to infer searcher interests. These rules can be put into algorithms as the basis for systems that provide query modification suggestions or implicitly reformulate the query as the searcher continues to work. H.1.2 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Models and Principles  X  User/Machine Systems  X  Human factors Reliability, Performance, Human Factors Implicit feedback, query recommendation, user study The search engine is becoming incr easingly important as a tool to acquire information and enable self directed learning. Most of the search engines nowadays rely on searchers to represent their information needs in the form of  X  X ueries X , which usually consist of a few words, sometimes connected by Boolean operators. The transformation of the information need into a query is known as query formulation. It has been well documented that searchers often have a difficult time articulating their information needs and formulating effective search queries ([1], [4]). As computers have become consumer products and th e Internet has become a mass medium, searching the Web has become a daily activity for everyone from children to scientists. When people demand more of Web services, such short queries typed into search boxes are not robust enough to meet all of their demands ([13]). Different approaches have been di scussed in the literature to help searchers express their information needs, including interfaces that support the formulation of initial queries (e.g., Google Suggest, [19]) and techniques to a ssist query reformulation, such as query recommendation based on relevance feedback. Despite the demonstrated success of thes e techniques, there is an under-explored approach to further improving search engine performance and user experience, which is to capture and exploit searchers X  interactions with search engines. Current search engines prepare results only based on submitted queries. Even when relevance feedback techniques are used, modification of results does not happen until searchers provide explicit judgment on feedback terms. Although people examine results, and sometimes even navigate across pa ges of results, the information that they can see has been determined at the time of initial querying; their interactions with the search system in the result examination process are completely ignored. This is apparently a wasted opportunity for search engi nes to be more responsive and helpful. With information retrieval systems becoming more interactive, the system should also actively learn from such interactions and use it to improve retrieval. If search engines can consider the initial query as th e explicit representation of the information needs, and in the meantime, consider any additional behavior that searchers exhibit as implicit indications of their interests, they should then try to capture searchers X  interactions with search engines and leverage these interactions to provide query modification suggesti ons, such as query term recommendations, and specific search tips. This implicit approach to identifying searchers X  interests removes the cost and the cognitive interruption to the user of providing feedback ([9], [14]). The key challenge for this approach is to find a set of evidences that (1) can possibly be captured in a natural search setting, and (2) can reliably indicate users X  interests and reflect their information needs. There has been some work in each aspect, but the results are not conclusive yet (c.f., [3]). The emphasis of this dissertation is to formally study the range of evidences that searcher behavior offers and understand how each kind of evidence can be useful and in what way. It differs from previous work in several ways. Firstly, previous work in this vein has been largely focused on click streams as evidence to tune search results (e.g., [6], [17]) with only a few ex ceptions (such as [2]). In this dissertation, a wider variety of evidences and a wider range of granularity to support feedback and modification will be examined. In specific, the following types of behavioral evidences will be examined: view (time, number of revisits, pattern of eye movement and mouse movement, exit type) , scroll (time, speed, amount, distance) , mouse-over a link , click (i.e., select a link) , search within page , and query modification . For view and scroll , items in parenthesis are attributes of the behaviors that may be used as measures of the searcher X  X  interests. Secondly, all but one studies found so far study observable searcher behaviors as implicit interest indicators by somehow comparing them against explicit ra tings. This approach is based on the assumption that explicit ratings give more accurate information on what a searcher fi nds interesting and useful. If a behavioral measure is found to correlate well with the explicit ratings, it can potentially be used in lieu of or in conjunction with the explicit feedback. The only exception is [15]. When studying users X  behaviors on a job search website, they assumed that the action of a user applying for a particular job online is a reliable indicator of her interest in that job. Therefore, they evaluated the two implicit behavioral measur es (time spent reading a job description and the number of times a user revisits the description) based on how well they correlated with job application. Although job applicati on in this case seems to be a good indicator of the user X  X  interest, it is rare that such behavioral indicators are available in the general Web search context. Unlike previous studies, this disserta tion does not focus on whether a particular behavioral measure or combination of them correlates well with explicit measures of s earchers X  interests; instead, it seeks to gain better understanding of the process of inferring searcher interests from behaviors. Assuming a range of behaviors is observed by a human interm ediary (such as a reference librarian or a search expert), wh ich behavior(s) will she consider as evidences of interests? Does she use a single behavior or a set of behaviors to make the inference? When does she make the inference? Why does she believe that a certain behavior is useful? Are there any rules that are comm only used? It is hoped that the answers to these question do not only provide more evidences for the usefulness of behaviors as im plicit feedback measures in the context of Web search, but also will advance the understanding of why and how each type of evidence is useful. Such an understanding forms a foundation for improving algorithms that exploit implicit feedback on Web search engines to deliver better search results and create better user experience. Thirdly, a gap in the literature is that research on implicit feedback has paid little or no attention to task ([8]). Most previous studies examine behavior in an online reading environment (e.g., reading Usenet news or academic articles), but few have focused on examining the behavior during a Web search environment. This dissertation tries to fill in this gap. Web search has its distinctive features. For example, previous studies (e.g., [5]) have found that when examining search results list page searchers do not read the list linearly from top to bottom, as in other reading scenarios. In terms of observi ng the searcher X  X  behavior as evidence of interests, we should at least pay attention to whether a piece of evidence is collected from behaviors on the result list page, or those on external content pages. The results list page is more uniformly structured, so findings from this page are more easily generalized across search e ngines. If behaviors on external content pages are found to be more useful, then future studies will be needed to further study the features of those pages and see if the set of useful behaviors has any correlation with the feature set. Most previous studies focus on the search results list (e.g., [6], [17]), while [7] argues that it is important to collect data beyond the search results list and consider all pages visited in the entire search session. Another implication of focusing on the Web search context is that all the evidence that will be c onsidered in the study can be automatically captured in real time in a natural setting without assuming the availability of other evidence (such as search history or user profile, as in [18]) so that the techniques arising from the study are self-contained and readily deployable in any search engines. From this perspective, th is study is practice oriented and promises highly pr actical impact. The study consists of two phases of data collection. The goal of the first phase is to build a co rpus of Web searches involving underspecification and query modifi cation. Recordings of these searches capture different aspects of searchers X  behavior and serve as the input for the second phase of data collection. In the second phase, search experts and informa tion professionals (referred to as search analysts in the study) will be recruited to examine selected recordings from the corpus and attempt to infer the interests of the searchers based on different subsets of the evidence. The following research questi ons will be examined: z Which type(s) of searcher behavi or is useful evidence of the z How does the quality of inference on the searcher X  X  interest z Does a single behavior indicate interest, or is it necessary to z Does the genre of the page affect the behaviors that can be z Finally, why is a certain behavior useful? What are the The goal of the first phase of the st udy is to collect recordings of searchers X  behaviors during Web search activities and create a corpus of search cases in which the searcher experiences difficulties due to underspecification problems. In order to increase the chance of obtaining such search cases, efforts will be made to recruit searchers who are more likely to experience difficulties in formulating queries, including. The literature ([11], [12]) and my personal experiences of running and observing user studies suggest that underspecified queries are more often associated with inexperienced search engine users, who are also the group who need more help with query reformulation, because they are less likely to come up with a well formulated query in the first place, so they need to conduc t further searches to get better results, but they are normally less skilled in modifying queries based on examination of initial resu lts and in general have lower awareness of the availability of he lp features in search engines. Therefore, making the system helpful to inexperienced users is an important goal of search systems that aim to serve large, general populations. The literature ([1], [16]) also suggests that people are more likely to underspecify when they search in a new field and when they have complicated information needs involving multiple aspects. Therefore, multi-faceted tasks with low searcher familiarity will be used. About 20-30 subjects will be recruited from UNC staff. Recruitment advertisement will be sent out on a mailing list and people interested in participating in the study will be asked to fill out a screening questionnaire, which includes demographic questions, questions on com puter use and Web search experiences, as well as a few query formulation exercises. Respondents who report less search experiences and formulate underspecified queries will be select ed to participate in the study. Selected participants will be notified via email and scheduled for individual study sessions, which last for about 1 hour. Each participant will search on about 6 tasks, all of which will involve multiple facets. To make them comparable, preferences are given to more close ended (fact finding or known item) search problems which involve about 3 facets. While the participant searches, backend logging will be pe rformed to record the URL of each page visited, time of visit and screen shots. All screen activities will also be recorded into a video file to capture mouse movements, and scrolling. Finally, eye tracking will be performed to record searchers X  eye positions on the screen. At the end of each task, a brief semi-structured interview will be conducted to ask the participant to reflect on the search process, focusing on two questions. First, does she think her initial query clearly stated what she wanted? Second, did she learn something in the search process which made her change he r search strategy? If so, what are some of the critical instances which triggered the change? These reflections on critical instances during the search process will be compared to the analys ts X  findings in the second phase. The goal of the second phase of data collection is to capture the process in which analysts review recordings of previous searches and make inferences on the sear cher X  X  interests based on the observed behaviors. Twelve search es cases will first be selected from those collected in the first phase. Preference will be given to cases in which the initial query underspecified the information need (missing some of the facets), but then the searcher went through multiple rounds of query modification (by adding or changing query terms) and/or br owsed through many result pages before she finally successfully found the information. Searchers X  reflections on the search processes will also aid the selection by confirming that they indeed felt that initial queries were underspecified. Four versions of each search selected case will be then prepared as stimuli for the second phase of the study, showing different aspects of the search behavior: z Version A contains a series of screen shots of the search z Version B contains the screenshots of all the pages that the z Version C is a video recording of the entire search process. z Version D is also a video recording. It is identical to Participants in this phase of the study are 12 search analysts who examine the recordings and infer searchers X  interests based on their behaviors (analysts do not know the original search problems). The expertise that is crucial to complete the task consists of experiences with observing people X  X  Web search behaviors and knowledge on helpi ng people improve their search strategies. People with high levels of expertise in those areas, such as reference librarians, user instruction librarians, and search intermediaries, will be recruited. All sessions are conducted individually and are recorded, in which analysts will be asked to think aloud. Each participant will work on two cases of each version (8 in total) in a counterbalanced design and will control the speed of the replay. They will be instructed to pause the replay whenever they notice a new piece of evidence which contributes to their inference. At that point, the researcher w ill ask the following questions: z Did you learn anything about the searcher X  X  interest? If so, z How did you learn it? What evidence(s) was it based on? z What would you say about the searcher X  X  interest now? z If you were to help the searcher find the information, are The researcher will force the replay to be paused if the analyst remains silent for a long time or when a major event happens in the recording. A major event is defined as submitting a query or visiting the search result list page. When the analyst finishes reading/watching a representation, she will be asked to summarize her inference and form a statement of the searcher X  X  information need based on her best guess. She will also be given the chance to discuss any evidence that she has found and compare the usefulness of different types of behavior. Content analysis ([10]) will be performed on the transcribed recordings of the search analysts X  think aloud protocols and responses to the interview questions asked at critical events and at the end of each task. Classificatory content analysis will be based on existing classifications of the behavioral sources of implicit feedback, as discussed in [9]. The unit of observation is an attempt of inference. Each attempt of inference will be coded by the behavior or behaviors that ar e used, when it is used, where it is used (on  X  X earch results list pa ge X  or on  X  X xternal result content page X ), and how it is used (e.g ., the absence/presence of the behavior, the frequency of the behavior, the velocity of the behavior, or the duration of the behavior). Each inference will also be compared to the original search problem and scored based on how well it reflects the searcher X  X  real interests. Analyses will be conducted at three different levels to inform the research questions. Firstly, an alysis will be conducted on the search case level and can shed light on the following research questions: How much evidence is necessary before an inference on the searcher X  X  interest can be made? Does more evidence lead to more reliable inferences? For both of these questions, it will be most interesting to identify the critical points when the inference is significantly improved. Secondly, the unit of analysis can be the type of behavior. This kind of analysis can be used to inform the following research questions. Which type(s) of search er behavior is useful evidence of the searcher X  X  interests? Are the behaviors on the search results list page more useful than those on the result content pages? How is each behavior used? What are the rules to make the inference? Different types of behaviors can also be compared on how well they lead to good inferences. Thirdly, comparisons can also be made at the representation type level. Inferences based on 4 versi ons of search representations can be compared in terms of their effectiveness. The potential difference between Version A and B reflects the value of monitoring the additional browsing paths beyond the search results list page as well as keeping track of the time spent on each page. The difference between Version B and C attests to the usefulness of capturing searchers X  be havior within a page (such as scrolling and mouse movement), in addition to recording page level information, such as URLs. The difference between Version C and D will show the added value of eye tracking. The short-term, more theoretical motivation of this dissertation is to advance the understanding of the relationship between the types of behavior that can be cap tured and searchers X  interests. The long-term, more practical goal will be to develop techniques that can capture searchers X  actions in real time and provide query recommendation immediately. The techniques are self-contained and readily deployable in any search engine. Based on the analysis, the dissertation is expected to conclude with some common rules that are used by the analysts and put forward design recommendations or algorithms that can be applied in automatic systems.
