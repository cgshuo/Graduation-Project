 Emmanuel Morin  X  Be  X  atrice Daille Abstract The automatic compilation of bilingual lists of terms from specialized comparable corpora using lexical alignment has been successful for single-word terms (SWTs), but remains disappointing for multi-word terms (MWTs). The low frequency and the variability of the syntactic structures of MWTs in the source and the target languages are the main reported problems. This paper defines a general framework dedicated to the lexical alignment of MWTs from comparable corpora that includes a compositional translation process and the standard lexical context analysis. The compositional method which is based on the translation of lexical items being restrictive, we introduce an extended compositional method that bridges the gap between MWTs of different syntactic structures through morphological links. We experimented with the two compositional methods for the French X  X apanese alignment task. The results show a significant improvement for the translation of MWTs and advocate further morphological analysis in lexical alignment. Keywords Terminology mining  X  Comparable corpora  X  Lexical alignment  X  Compositional translation 1 Introduction The automatic compilation of bilingual dictionaries from comparable corpora has received considerable attention in recent years. This attention was motivated by the scarcity of parallel corpora, especially for countries with only one official language and for language pairs not involving English. Moreover, since comparable corpora gather texts sharing common features (such as domain, topic, genre, discourse...) without having a source text-target text relationship, they are considered by human translators more trustworthy than parallel corpora (Bowker and Pearson 2002 ).
The lexical units that are collected from comparable corpora depend on the nature of the corpora: single-word units (SWUs) and multi-word units (MWUs) if the corpora gather documents belonging to general language, single-word terms (SWTs) and multi-word terms (MWTs) if the corpora gather documents belonging to a specialized language. A term is a lexical unit which represents a concept with in a domain.

The main work in compilation of specialized dictionaries is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts (Rapp 1995 ; Fung and McKeown 1997 ). Using this approach, good results are obtained for lexical alignment of SWUs with an accuracy of about 80% for the top 20 proposed candidates using large comparable corpora (176 million bytes of English-Chinese data in Fung and McKeown 1997 and 298 million-word English X  X erman corpus in Rapp 1999 ). Results drop to 60% for SWTs using small size specialized language corpora (0.1 million-word English X  X erman corpus in De  X  jean and Gaussier ( 2002 ) and 1.5 million-word French X  X apanese corpus in Morin et al. 2007 ). For MWTs, the results only reach 30 and 42% precision for the top 10 and top 20 candidates in a 0.84 million-word French X  X apanese specialized language corpus (Morin et al. 2007 ). These low results could be explained by the specific problems that are inherent to MWTs such as their low frequency, and the variability of their morphosyntactic structure in the source and the target languages.

For SWTs, the process is twofold: looking in a dictionary, and if no direct translation is available, starting the contextual analysis. Looking in the dictionary gives low results for MWTs: about 1% for French to Japanese or Japanese to French compared to 30% for French to Japanese and 20% for Japanese to French SWTs (Morin and Daille 2006 ). To extend the coverage of the bilingual dictionary, an intermediate step is added between looking in the dictionary and the contextual analysis that will propose several translation candidates to compare with the target MWTs. These candidate translations are obtained thanks to a compositional translation method based on the compositionality property of MWTs (Melamed 1997 ; Grefenstette 1999 ). This method reveals some limits when some lexical items of the MWTs are not part of the dictionary or when the translated combinations are not identified by the term extraction program in the target language.

Within this context, we propose an extended compositional method that makes use of morphological knowledge to link an unknown lexical item, part of the MWT, to a word in the dictionary or a part of the MWT in the target language. We experimented with this method for French-Japanese lexical alignment within a multilingual terminology mining chain made up of two terminology extraction systems; one in each language, and an alignment program. The term extraction systems are publicly available and both extract MWTs. The alignment program makes use of the direct context-vector approach (Fung 1998 ; Rapp 1999 ) slightly modified to handle SWTs and MWTs (Daille and Morin 2005 ). The results show an improvement of 33% in the translation of MWTs that demonstrate the efficiency of the morphologically based-method for lexical alignment.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the multilingual terminology mining chain that uses the direct context-vector approach that is slightly modified to handle single-and multi-word terms. Section 3 presents the lexically-and morphologically-based compositional methods used for MWTs alignment. Section 4 describes the different linguistic resources used in our experiments and evaluates the performance of the lexically-based and morpholog-ically-based compositional methods on a French X  X apanese diabetes corpora. Finally, Sect. 5 presents our conclusion. 2 Bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora In this section, we first describe the direct context-vector approach initially dedicated to SWT alignment from comparable corpora. We then present our adaptation of this approach from SWTs to MWTs. It aligns source MWTs with target single words, SWTs or MWTs. 2.1 Lexical alignment The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts. The basis of this observation consists in identifying  X  X irst-order affinities X  (Grefenstette 1994a , p. 279) for each source and target language:  X  First-order affinities describe what other words are likely to be found in the immediate vicinity of a given word  X . These affinities can be represented by vectors, and each vector element represents a word which occurs within the window of the word to be translated (for instance a seven-word window approximates syntactic dependencies). Translation is obtained by comparing the source context vector to each translation candidate vector after having translated each element of the source vector with a general dictionary.

The above approach can be described through the following four steps (Rapp 1995 ; Fung and McKeown 1997 ): 1. We collect all the lexical units in the context of each lexical unit i and count 2. Using a bilingual dictionary, we translate the lexical units of the source context 3. For a lexical unit to be translated, we compute the similarity between the 4. The candidate translations of a lexical unit are the target lexical units closest to
Using this approach, (Fung 1998 ) extracts English X  X hinese one-item candidate translations from two years of English and Chinese newspaper articles by matching the context vector and indicates that 76% of English words obtained a correct Chinese translation in the first 20 ranked list of candidate translations. From English X  X erman newspaper corpora of 85 million words, (Rapp 1999 ) improves the precision to 89% on the first one-item 10 candidates using the same techniques. Concerning specialized domains (De  X  jean et al. 2002 ) obtain 43 and 51% for the first 10 and 20 candidates respectively in a 0.1 million-word medical corpus, and 79 and 84% in an 8 million-word social science corpus. For single-item French X  X nglish terms applied on a medical corpus of 1.2 million words (Chiao and Zweigenbaum 2002b ) obtained a precision of 61 and 94% for the top 10 and top 20 candidates. 2.2 Multi-word terms adaptation If the results obtained in the field of bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora are promising, they only cover bilingual one lexical item from general or specialized corpora. Our goal is to find translations for MWTs from specialized comparable corpora. If MWTs are more representative of domain specialities than SWTs, pinpointing their translations poses specific problems:  X  SWTs and MWTs are not always translated by a term of the same length. For  X  When an MWT is translated into an MWT of the same length, the target  X  An MWT could appear in texts under different forms reflecting either syntactic,
In order to take into account these three problems, fertility, non-compositionality, and variations, we have defined a multilingual terminology mining chain that uses the direct context-vector approach which is slightly modified to handle both single-and multi-word terms (see Fig. 1 ).

The first modification (before step 1 of the previous approach) of the direct context-vector approach consists in identifying both source and target languages of MWTs and their variations. For this task, the terminology extraction pro-gram will be scaled to deal with large corpora and its design was basically multilingual.

In this chain, the translation of the lexical units of the context vectors (step 2 of the previous approach), which depends on the coverage of the bilingual dictionary vis-a ` -vis the corpus, is the most important step: when the number of elements translated in the context vector is greater, the context vector is more discriminating in selecting translations in the target language. Since the lexical units refer to SWTs and MWTs, the dictionary must contain many entries which occur in the corpus. For SWTs, combining a general bilingual dictionary with a specialized bilingual dictionary or a multilingual thesaurus to translate context vectors ensures that many of their elements will be translated (Chiao and Zweigenbaum 2002a ;De  X  jean et al. 2002 ). Moreover, we use a compositional translation method to compensate bilingual dictionary when the multi-word units of the context vector are not directly translated.

Within this context, for an MWT to be translated, we first use the compositionality property of the MWTs in order to find candidate translations. If the compositional translation process fails, the lexical alignment process is carried out. 3 Compositional translation method In order to increase the coverage of the dictionary for MWTs that could not be directly translated, we propose to make use of the compositional property that characterizes, at least, half of MWTs X 48.7% were reported by (Baldwin and Tanaka 2004 ) for English/Japanese NN compounds. Compositionality is defined as the property that the  X  X he meaning of the whole is a function of the meaning of the parts  X  (Keenan and Faltz 1985 , pp. 24 X 25): a frying pan is indeed a pan used for frying . Montague grammar is one of the theoretical bases of this principle that has been applied to machine translation (Tsutsumi 1990 ), and to statistical translation alignment (Simard and Langlais 2003 ). The assumption of compositionality in the translation process is that it is possible to translate a whole sequence by translating each part individually, and then by appropriately piecing together the translated parts. 3.1 Lexically-based compositional method The implementation of the principle of translation compositionality for MWTs relies on the following steps (Grefenstette 1999 ; Tanaka 2002 ; Robitaille et al. 2006 ): 1. For an MWT of the source language to be translated, we translate each 2. We generate all possible combinations of the translated elements regardless of 3. From the set of translation candidates, we select the most likely translations
The number of generated translations can be reduced using MWT POS patterns in the source and the target languages. For instance, (Tanaka and Baldwin 2003 ) defined the following templates to filter translation candidates: N 1 N 2 Japanese structure is translated by N 1 N 2 (33.2% of the cases), Adj 1 N 2 (28.4%), N 2 of  X  the  X  N 1 (4.4%) English structure. But using or not MWT POS patterns, the MWT will be not be taken into account in the translation step if it is not possible to translate all the parts of an MWT, or when the translated combinations are not identified by the term extraction program in the target language. 3.2 Morphologically-based compositional method The lexically-based composition method is restrictive. (Robitaille et al. 2006 ) proposed therefore a backing-off method: if there is insufficient data in the dictionary to translate an MWT of length n , a scaled MWT of length less than or equal to n is used instead. Working on French-Japanese translations, they first decompose the French MWT into combinations of shorter multi-word unit elements. This approach makes the direct translation of a subpart of the MWT possible if it is present in the bilingual dictionary. For example, the French term syndrome de fatigue chronique ( chronic fatigue disorder ) yields the following four combinations: (i) [ syndrome de fatigue chronique ], (ii) [ syndrome de fatigue ][ chronique ], (iii) [ syndrome ][ fatigue chronique ] and (iv) [ syndrome ][ fatigue ][ chronique ].
The morphologically-based compositional method is a generalisation of the backing-off method proposed by (Robitaille et al. 2006 ) to the word stem level. Instead of skipping a word when it does not appear the dictionary, we try to link it to a word in the dictionary using morphological knowledge. As derivation is quite a productive process, at least for Romance languages, many kinds of information can be marked by morphemes which form new words. In specialized languages, derived nominals are completely productive. Our assumption is that derivational morphol-ogy is a compositional process that should be part of the translation process. Two cases should be considered:
When the derivation process retains its compositional meaning, the two forms are semantically linked in a language. An example would be the -er affix in English whose the result would be  X  X ne who does x  X  such as  X  baker/to bake . When the derived word has taken on an idiosyncratic meaning from the input word, we assume that it also retains its compositional meaning through the translation process. An example would be the norme  X  X tandard X /normal  X  X sual X  pair: normal  X  X sual X  has lost its composi-tional interpretation in French, but could be translated by the standard stem meaning in another language.

When a word, part of an MWT, is a derived nominal or adjectival, we transform the derived word to a neutral form using stripping-recoding rules. Stripping-recoding rules label an MWT pattern and give as output candidate MWTs of another pattern. A stripping-recoding rule M takes as input a word which removes the affix, normalises the stem to undo phonological change, and generates a neutral form. The generated form is a lemma that possibly characterizes either a verb ( retrieval/ retrieve ), a noun ( spotless/spot ), or an adjective ( gravity/grave ) depending on the MWT patterns. The following stripping-recoding rules M is applied to the denominal adjective, part of the binary term of pattern N 1 Adj for French language. Several stripping-recoding rules are available for that pattern. The result will be a binary term of N 1 Prep Art ? N 2 .

When one or several neutral forms that were generated by the stripping-recoding rules belong to the bilingual dictionary, we apply steps 2. and 3. of the lexically-based composition method. This process is summarized in the following example:  X  (source) N 1 Adj ! N 1 Prep Art ? N 2 , (target) N 2 N 1  X  (French) essence = N 1 forestire / Adj ! essence = N 1 de = Prep la = Art foret = N 2
In the above example, although nothing prohibits it, the underlined MWT does not exist as surface realization.

The same method could be used in the target language after the translation process to link the translated MWU to an MWT identified by the term extraction program. In the following example, the underlined English MWT of Adj N pattern does not exist as surface realization contrary to the MWT of N 2 N 1 pattern.  X  (source) N 1 Adj 2 , (target) Adj 2 N 1 ! N 2 N 1
The stripping-recoding rules could be manually encoded, mined from a monolingual corpus using a learning method such as (Mikheev 1997 ), or supplied by a source terminology extraction system that handles morphological variations.
Working on French specialized language as the source language, we concentrate on MWTs of length 2. Several MWT patterns could be linked through derivation introducing or not a semantic change. 1. N 1 Adj ! N 1 Prep Art ? N 2 with M X  Adj ; N 2  X  index glyce  X  mique (glycemic 2. N 1 Prep Art ? N 2 ! N 2 Adj with M X  N 1 ; Adj  X  gravite  X  du risque (severity of 3. N 1 Adj ! N 2 Adj with M X  N 1 ; N 2  X  entrepo  X  t frigorifique (cold store) / entrepo-4. N Adj 1 ! N Adj 2 with M X  Adj 1 ; Adj 2  X  phe  X  nol polyme  X  rise  X  (polymerized phe-
But only the first pattern is highly productive in French and particularly frequent in scientific fields (Daille 2001 ). The Adjective/Noun switch commonly involves a relational adjective ( ADJR ). According to grammatical tradition, there are two main categories among adjectives: epithetic adjectives such as important ( significant ) and relational adjectives such as sanguin ( blood ). The former cannot have an agentive interpretation in contrast to the latter: the adjective sanguin ( blood ) within the MWT acidite  X  sanguine ( blood acidity ) is an argument to the predicative noun acidite  X  importante ( significant acidity ). Relational adjectives are mainly denominal adjectives. There are appropriate adjective-forming suffixes for French that lead the adjective-forming suffix that will be employed as well as the alternation of the noun stem that could occur. Relational adjectives that form part of an MWT are often translated by a noun whatever the target language is. 4 Experiments In this section, we investigate the two compositional translation methods on the French NAdj structure to obtain its correct translation in Japanese. The stripping-recoding rules are supplied by the French terminology extraction system that handles morphological variations (see Sect. 4.2 ). We will outline the bilingual comparable corpora and dictionaries used for our experiments, and present the term extraction programs. We then evaluate the performance of the lexically-based and morphologically-based compositional methods, and finally compare these methods with the lexical alignment method proposed by Rapp ( 1995 ); Fung and McKeown ( 1997 ).
 4.1 Bilingual comparable corpus and dictionary In order to obtain a comparable corpus, we selected the French and Japanese documents from the Web. They were taken from the medical domain, within the sub-domain of  X  X iabetes X  and  X  X utrition X . Document harvesting was carried out by a domain-based search, then by manual selection. A search for documents sharing the same domain can be achieved by using keywords reflecting the specialized domain: Japanese,  X   X   X  and  X   X  ( diabetes , and overweight ). Then the documents were manually selected by native speakers of each language who are not domain specialists. These documents (248 for French and 538 for Japanese) were converted into plain text from HTML or PDF, yielding a 1.5 million-word corpus (a 0.7 million-word corpus for French and a 0.8 million-word corpus for Japanese).
The French X  X apanese bilingual dictionary used in the translation phase was composed of four dictionaries freely available on the Web ([dico 1], 1 [dico 2], 2 [dico 3], 3 and [dico 4]), 4 and the French X  X apanese Scientific Dictionary (Hakusui-sha 1989 ) (called [dico 5]). Besides [dico 4], which deals with the medical domain, the other resources are general (as [dico 1, 2, and 3]) or technical (as [dico 5]) dictionaries. Table 2 shows the main features of the dictionaries. Merging the dictionaries yields a single resource with 173,156 entries (114,461 single-word units and 58,695 multi-word units) and an average of 2.1 translations per entry. 4.2 Term extraction programs In this study, we chose to use ACABIT (Daille 2003b ), which is scaled to deal with large corpora and whose design is basically multilingual, with full implementations for French, 5 English, and Japanese 6 (Takeuchi et al. 2004 ).

The terminological units that are extracted are MWTs whose syntactic patterns correspond either to a canonical or a variation structure. The patterns are expressed using part-of-speech tags: 7 for French, Brill X  X  POS tagger 8 (Brill 1994 ) and the FLEM lemmatiser 9 (Namer 2000 ) are used, and for Japanese, ChaSen 10 (Matsumoto et al. 1999 ). For French, the main patterns are NN , NPrepN and NAdj , and for Japanese, NN , NSuff , AdjN and PrefN . The variants handled are morphological for both languages, syntactical only for French, and compounding only for Japanese. We consider as a morphological variant a morphological modification of one of the components of the base form, as a syntactical variant the insertion of another word into the components of the base form, and as a compounding variant the agglutination of another word to one of the components of the base form. For example, in French, the  X  base form of NPrepN pattern: se  X  cre  X  tion d X  X nsuline ( insulin secretion );  X  inflexional variant : se  X  cre  X  tions d X  X nsuline ( insulin secretions );  X  syntactic variant (insertion inside the base form of a modifier): se  X  cre  X  tion  X  syntactic variant (expansion coordination of base form): secre  X  tion de peptide et
The MWT candidates secre  X  tion insulinique ( insulin secretion ) and hyperse  X  cre  X  tion insulinique ( insulin hypersecretion ) have also been identified and semantically linked MWTs. In this study, we have at our disposal a list of 125 French stripping-recoding rules to transform a relational adjective into a noun.
In Japanese, the MWT  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  ( insulin secretion ) appears in the following forms:  X  base form of NN pattern:  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  / N 1  X   X  / N 2 ( insulin secretion );  X  compounding variant (agglutination of a word at the end of the base form):
Up to now, the Japanese term extraction program does not cluster terms. 4.3 French N Adj reference lists We needed to distinguish between relational and epithetic adjectives appearing among the French NAdj candidates supplied by the French term extraction program to demonstrate the relevance of the morphological links. To build two French NAdj reference lists, we proceeded as follows: 1. From the list of MWT candidates, we selected those sharing an NAdj structure. 2. We kept only the candidate terms which occur more than twice in the French 3. We manually selected linguistically well-formed candidate terms. Here, 360 4. We took out the terms that are directly translated by the bilingual dictionary and
Finally, we manually created two French reference lists from the 1,578 candidate terms obtained:  X  X  NADJE ] composed of 749 terms where ADJE is an epithetic adjective;  X  X  NADJR ] composed of 829 terms where ADJR is a relational adjective. 4.4 Lexically-based compositional method For the two French reference lists, we first evaluated the quality of the lexically-based compositional method. Table 3 shows the results obtained for French to Japanese direction. The first column reminds the number of French terms to be translated (# FR terms). Since the compositional method can yield several Japanese translations for one French term, the next two columns indicate the number of French terms for which one or more translations are obtained in Japanese (# FR trans., and # JP trans.). Finally, the last column indicates the number of correct Japanese translations (# correct JP trans.).

The results of this experiment show that only a small quantity of terms were translated by the lexically-based compositional method. Here, the terms belonging to [ NADJE ] were more easily translated (76/749 with a precision 11 of 69%) than the terms belonging to [ NADJR ] (8/829 with a precision of 63%). The best translations of candidates belonging to the [ NADJE ] list are those where the adjective refers to a quantity such as faible ( low ), moyen ( medium ), or haut ( high ). Since our French-Japanese dictionary contained a small quantity of medical terms, the identified translations of the candidates belonging to the [ NADJR ] list refers to generic relational adjectives such as poids normal ( standard weight - X   X   X   X  ), e  X  tude nationale ( national study - X   X   X   X  ), or activite  X  physique ( physical activity - X   X   X   X  ). We noticed that some generated MWUs do not exist in French such as poids (de) norme ( standard weight ), only the NADJR form exists.

We were unable to generate any translations for 56 (12%) and 227 (27%) French terms respectively from the [ NADJE ] and [ NADJR ] lists. This could be explained because one or several content words of the MWT candidates were not present in the bilingual dictionary. With regard to the other French terms not translated, 617 (82%) and 594 (72%) respectively from the [ NADJE ] and [ NADJR ] lists, the Japanese translation candidate is often an unsuitable Japanese term or sometimes a correct Japanese term not identified by the Japanese extraction system. 4.5 Morphologically-based compositional method We will now turn to the evaluation of the morphologically-based compositional method that specialized in the translation of the [ NADJR ] list (see Table 4 ). By comparison with the previous method, the results of this experiment for French to Japanese direction show that a significant quantity of terms belonging to the [ NADJR ] list has now been translated. Since the compositional method can yield several Japanese translations for one French term, we associated 170 Japanese terms to 128 French terms with a high level of precision: 88%. Here, we were unable to generate any translations for 136 (16%) terms in comparison with the 227 terms (27%) for the lexically-based compositional method. This gain resulted from the easy way to translate a noun rather than the corresponding relational adjective from the dictionary.

In Table 5 , each French suffix is associated with the number of identified translations. The most productive suffixes are -ique such as glyce  X  mie / glyce  X  mique corporel ( body / bodily ), and -aire such as aliment / alimentaire ( food / dietary ).
Finally from 859 terms relative to NADJR structure, we translated 30 terms (5.1%) with the dictionary, eight terms (0.6%) with a precision of 62% by the lexically-based compositional method, and 128 terms (14.9%) with a precision of 88% by the morphologically-based compositional method. It was difficult to find more translations for several reasons: 1. Some French specialized adjectives or nouns were not included in our 2. Some terms were not taken into account by the Japanese extraction system. For 3. Some French term translations were not included in the Japanese corpus. For 4.6 Comparison with lexical alignment method In order to compare the morphologically-based compositional method with the lexical alignment method, we conducted a new experiment. For this experiment, we built a French X  X apanese terminology reference list ( i.e . [reference_list]) from the previous 128 French terms for which the Japanese translation was manually identified.

Table 6 presents the results obtained with the lexical alignment method proposed by (Rapp 1995 ; Fung and McKeown 1997 ) for French to Japanese direction. In this experiment, we use a window of 7 words, the association score is Log-likelihood, and the vector distance measure is Cosine. The first two columns indicate the number of terms to be translated (# terms) and the number of translations found in the ranked list of candidate translations (# trans.). The last two columns indicate the percentage of French terms for which the correct translation was obtained among the top 10 and top 20 candidates (TOP 10 and TOP 20 ).

The results obtained with the lexical alignment method are very low. In this instance, we obtained a precision of 15% and 21% for the top 10 and top 20 candidates. In comparison, we obtained a precision of 88% for the top 1 by using the morphologically-based compositional method.

In this experiment, the frequency of the terms to be translated is an important factor in the vectorial approach. In fact, when the frequency of the term to be translated increases, the associated context vector is more discriminating in selecting translations. For instance, 103 of the 128 French terms belonging to [reference_list] have a frequency lower than 20 occurrences. By comparison, (Chiao and Zweigenbaum 2002b ) using a 1.2 million-word French X  X nglish medical corpus, obtained a precision of 61 and 94% for the top 10 and top 20 candidates, with a reference list 95 single words. The 95 French terms have an occurrence frequency higher than 100. 5 Conclusion This study investigated the compilation of bilingual terminologies from a specialized comparable corpus and showed how to push back the limits of the methods used in alignment programs to translate both SWTs and MWTs. We proposed an extended compositional method that bridges the gap between MWTs of different syntactic structures through morphological links. We experimented with this method on MWTs of NAdj structure involving a relational adjective. Using a list of stripping-recoding rules conjugated with a terminology extraction system, the method was more efficient than the lexically-based compositional method. The evaluation proposed at the end of the paper shows that 170 French X  X apanese MWTs were extracted with a high level of precision (88%). This increases the coverage of the French X  X apanese terminology of MWTs that can be obtained by using the bilingual dictionary or the lexically-based compositional method. We are aware that the efficiency of this method relies on the completeness of the morphological resources, dictionaries and stripping-recoding rules. Such resources need to be up to date for new domains and corpus.

In this study, we have observed that MWTs are of a different nature in each language: French patterns cover nominal phrases while Japanese patterns focus on morphologically-built compounds. A Japanese nominal phrase is not considered as a term: thus, the Japanese extraction system does not identify  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  ( caloric intake ) as a candidate MWT but  X  X  X  X   X   X  , unlike the French extraction system which does the contrary ( apport calorique  X  caloric intake ). Since our morphologically-based compositional method associated  X  X  X  X   X   X  to apport calorique , we could yield the nominal phrase  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  and improve lexical alignment.
