 We report preliminary results of the impact of time pres-sure and system delays on search behavior from a laboratory study with forty-three participants. To induce time pres-sure, we randomly assigned half of our study participants to a treatment condition where they were only allowed five minutes to search for each of four ad-hoc search topics. The other half of the participants were given no task time limits. For half of participants X  search tasks (n=2), five second de-lays were introduced after queries were submitted and SERP results were clicked. Results showed that participants in the time pressure condition queried at a significantly higher rate, viewed significantly fewer documents per query, had significantly shallower hover and view depths, and spent sig-nificantly less time examining documents and SERPs. We found few significant differences in search behavior for sys-tem delay or interaction effects between time pressure and system delay. These initial results show time pressure has a significant impact on search behavior and suggest the de-sign of search interfaces and features that support people who are searching under time pressure.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  Search Process Search Behavior; Time Pressure; System Delays
Recently, increased attention has been paid to how sys-tem delays impact search behavior and the user experience in the context of interactive information retrieval (IIR) [1, 8, 15, 16]. Users of search systems with slower query re-sponse times have been found to have lower perceptions of system usability and helpfulness [1]. Studies examining sys-tem delays have found users are tolerant of search delays up to a X  X ipping point X  X eyond which behaviors and perceptions change [15]. User sensitivity to delay varies across individ-uals, the average speed of the system used [1], and how the information is presented [15]. It has also been found that searchers who experience both query and document response delays view fewer documents, but mark a higher percentage as relevant, although the delay had no impact on the number of queries issued, the number of documents marked relevant, the depth of results inspected or search accuracy [8].
Although there has been a resurgence of interest in the im-pact of search system delay on user experience, a long line of research precedes this interest. In 1968, Miller [9] described system response times exceeding two seconds as changing the character of X  X an-computer conversational transactions X  and provided a taxonomy of acceptable response times de-pending on the type and complexity of system interactions and the extent to which the response delay would disrupt the user X  X  task. Since this early work, researchers have found that perceived wait time and the impact of delays can be re-duced by informing users of the system response status [11], incrementally loading pages [2], or displaying filler text or images [6] while the system is processing its response.
While system delays have been investigated in IIR, one variable that has not been investigated much is time pres-sure. Research on time pressured decision-making has found that people adapt under time pressure: they may spend less time in each decision stage, spend less time processing indi-vidual pieces of information, accelerate the pace of the task or information processing, or even satisfice in their decisions [12]. Time has been shown to be an important contextual factor in search [13]; however, the impact of time pressure on search behaviors and perceptions is less well understood. Recent studies have have shown when searchers have less time to complete tasks, they have lower perceptions of their search performance [7] and task completion [17], less sat-isfaction with results [7, 17] and less knowledge gained [7]. Searchers also report lower pre-task search confidence [7] and more negative affect [7] and stress [17]. Time pressure has also been found to impact search satisfaction even when the same amount of time was given to complete tasks [4]. Fi-nally, Mishra et al. [10] found dissatisfaction among people who searched for time-critical information.

In this paper, we report preliminary results of a study investigating the impact of time pressure, system delays and interaction effects on search behaviors and user expe-rience. We present the results of our analyses of interaction measures as well as time pressure and delay manipulation checks.
We conducted a laboratory experiment where we manip-ulated task time limit and system response time. To manip-ulate task time limit, half of the participants were given an unexpected task time limit just before they started the ex-perimental search tasks. This time limit was presented via pop-up message after they completed the practice task and informed them they had only 5 minutes to complete each ex-perimental search task (Figure 1). These instructions were intended to simulate a situation in which an urgent notifi-cation changes one X  X  expectations about the time available to complete a task. The 5 minute time limit represented approximately half of the mean task completion times from a prior study [5] where different participants used the same system to complete three of the same tasks without time lim-its. The system tracked the time, and after participants had been searching for 5 minutes, popped-up another message indicating time was up.

Pa rticipants who were not given a task time limit were not provided with any instructions regarding the amount of time to spend on each task, although all participants were aware that the experimental session would last 1hr and 15min. If these participants were still searching after 1hr and 5min (i.e., with approximately 10 minutes remaining in the exper-imental session), we stopped them so they could complete the exit questionnaire and interview. Based on our previous experiences, we did not expect we would need to do this; however, this occurred in seven cases. To minimize time pressure caused by researcher presence [14], the researcher was stationed in an adjacent room while participants com-pleted the study.

System response time was a within-subjects variable with two levels: delay and no delay. Participants completed two tasks in which we introduced 5 second delays after they sub-mitted queries and clicked on SERP results and two tasks in which the system was not delayed. We selected a 5 second delay based on prior research which indicated that a delay of 4 seconds changed behaviors but not attitudes and is usually considered acceptable to users (delays of 7-10 seconds have been found to be unacceptable by users [15]). We presented delays in 2 orders: half of the participants experienced de-lays during their first and third tasks while the other half experienced delays during their second and fourth tasks.
The basic procedure was as follows. Participants were first shown the experiment instructions on screen including the simulated work task scenario and then completed a practice task to become familiar with the system; we did not im-pose a time limit or system delay during the practice task. Once participants completed the practice task, those with a task time limit were shown the instructions in Figure 1 before being presented with their first search task. For each search task, participants were shown the topic, completed a pre-search questionnaire, conducted their search and then completed a post-search questionnaire. After conducting all four searches, participants completed an exit questionnaire. Following this, the researcher returned to the room for a final interview and debriefing.
Following Borlund X  X  [3] guidelines, search tasks were sit-uated in the context of a project in which a research team needs to compare news coverage about four topics during the (consecutive) U.S. presidential terms of Clinton, Bush and Obama. Participants were told their job was to examine news during Clinton X  X  second term, 1996-2000, which cor-responded to the date range of the test collection [18]. We wanted the scenario to provide participants with a rationale for searching articles from this time period and to make this characteristic of the collection salient to help ground par-ticipants X  relevance judgments. The scenario indicated that participants should find 8-12 articles per topic.
We selected topics from the collection with contemporary relevance where prior studies have reported that participants found the tasks at least moderately interesting and difficult [5]. We aimed to minimize potential variability in interest and difficulty in order to examine the impact of our inde-pendent variables. Four topics were used: wildlife extinction (347), journalist risks (354), piracy (367) and population growth (435). Participants were presented with the topic descriptions before each search.

To minimize order effects, we created a set of 24 topic rotations. We assigned the topic rotations to time limit and delay order combinations such that each topic rotation was used twice: once in each time limit condition and once in each delay order. We randomly assigned participants to time limit, delay order and topic rotation.
Our search questionnaires measured several constructs in-cluding system usability, task difficulty, metacognitive ac-tions and satisfaction. Several items functioned as manip-ulation checks to see if participants felt time pressure and noticed system delays (see Table 1). Participants responded to these items with a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). In this paper, we only present items related to the manipulation checks and will analyze the ad-ditional measures in future work.
All participants used the same search system which re-sembled a standard search engine. The Whoosh IR Toolkit was used as the core of the retrieval system, with BM25 as the retrieval algorithm, using standard parameters, but with an implicit ANDing of query terms to restrict the re-trieval set. Only a portion of the collection was indexed to ensure that the natural response time of the system was quick and constant. This was to control the effects of both the natural and experimental delays as much as possible. The documents included in the index consisted of all the TREC pooled documents for the given topics, along with the top 100 documents retrieved from the full index given a set of user generated queries from a past study (approx-imately 100-200 queries per topic). In total, over 200,000 documents were indexed. In all conditions, the search sys-tem displayed a spinning wheel when it was busy.
Fo rty-five people from a major research university partic-ipated including undergraduate students (n=13), graduate students (n=8) and staff (n=22) representing many differ-ent majors and occupations. Participants ranged in age from 18-59 years (M=32.1, SD=12.8) and 31 were female. Par-ticipants were compensated $20 USD.
We analyzed 163 tasks completed by 43 participants using a mixed ANOVA. We excluded data from 2 participants with no task time limit who spent most of the time completing a single search task, 7 tasks where participants with no task time limit were stopped in their third task or final task, and 2 tasks where participants accidentally ended the tasks by pressing the wrong button.
We conducted a series of manipulation checks to make sure our experimental manipulations were successful. We found those with the task time limit reported feeling signif-icantly more time pressure, a greater need to work fast and more rushed (Table 1). We found significant differences in perceived quickness of SERP and document display between the delay conditions. We found no interaction effects, but note a significant effect of delay on perceived time pressure.
We examined task completion times and found significant effects of task time limit and system delay on the total task time as shown in Table 1. The introduction of time lim-its and system delays complicates comparison of interaction measures as the total delay experienced by any one person is a function of the number of queries issued and documents viewed by this person. For this reason, we also examined ad-justed task times where we subtracted the cumulative delay experienced by each participant for each task from the total task time; we found significant main effects of time limit and no main effect of delay. Interaction effects were significant (F(2,118)=7.03, p &lt; .01).

To check the delay manipulation, we examined query and document processing times (in seconds). As expected, we found no significant differences in organic system response times and significant differences in the mean total processing time (organic + delay) according to delay condition. It took longer for the system to return requests for tasks with delay condition (query: M=5.92, SD=0.96; document: M=5.20, SD=1.16) than for tasks without delay (query: M=0.94, SD=0.84; document: M=0.29, SD=0.34). We found no main effect for time limit or interaction effects.
Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of par-ticipants X  search behaviors by time limit and response time condition. With one exception, there were no significant interaction effects, so we only report main effects. We nor-malized time-based measures to facilitate comparison. The adjusted rate-based measures reflect the number of queries, document views and documents marked relevant per minute using adjusted times; that is, total time minus time spent in delay as in Taylor, Dennis &amp; Cummings [15]. While partic-ipants who experienced a task time limit had higher rates of querying, document viewing and marking documents as relevant, only the difference for query rate was significant. There were no significant differences according to whether or not participants experienced delays; in fact, these measures were very similar in these two conditions.

When we examine actions per query, we see those who ex-perienced the task time limit examined search results more shallowly. They viewed fewer SERPs and documents and also did not navigate as deeply in the search results list. All of these differences were statistically significant. Partici-pants with a task time limit also spent significantly less time viewing documents and SERPs. Although the trend was for participants to view fewer SERPs and documents per query when they experienced delays and not go as deeply in the search results list, these differences were not significant. Par-ticipants spent significantly more time viewing documents for delayed tasks, but they spent roughly equal amounts of time viewing SERPs for their delayed and non-delayed tasks.
With respect to performance, there were no differences in participants X  save rates (% viewed marked relevant) ac-cording to time limit or response time conditions. Although we have not examined the content of the documents par-ticipants saved, we examined whether participants met the scenario goal of finding 8-12 relevant articles. This goal was achieved more often for tasks where no task time limit was present (96% vs. 84% of tasks) and for tasks where no de-lays were present (92% vs. 86% of tasks). Only 76% of tasks with both a delay and a task time limit had at least 8 pages marked relevant compared to 100% of tasks with no task time limit and delay.
We investigated the impact of time pressure and system delays on search behaviors. Results showed participants who were given task time limits queried at a significantly higher rate, viewed significantly fewer documents per query, had significantly shallower hover and view depths, and spent sig-nificantly less time SERPs. They also spent significantly less time examining documents, and presumably, making judg-ments about which documents to save.

We did not find significant differences in search behavior with respect to system delays beyond the time spent com-pleting the task (total and adjusted) and the time spent per document. While the delay was noticed by most partici-pants, it did not significantly impact their search behaviors. These findings are consistent with other studies [1, 8]. Of course, it is likely that larger delay times would produce different results: Taylor et al. [15] found a tipping point between 7 and 11 seconds for behavioral impacts but some changes to satisfaction were observed at lower thresholds. Whether the delay is consistent or intermittent also seems to play a role [1]. Further analysis of the questionnaires and debriefings will likely provide additional insight about how time pressure and system delays impacted the user experi-ence.

Interestingly, we found considerable variability in the task completion times for those without task time limits and two participants, whose data were excluded, used nearly the entire experimental session to search for a single task. For those tasks included in analyses, task completion times ranged from 1.76min to 36.27min. For 10 tasks, the total task completion time exceeded 15min. These variations sur-prised us because they differ considerably from what we have observed in previous laboratory studies, where the general challenge is often to create tasks that will require sustained interaction.

While preliminary, our initial results open a new line of inquiry into how time pressure impacts search behaviors and how search tools might be designed to support people who are searching under time pressure. For example, interface features that make it easier for people to query, assess rel-evance and monitor progress might be especially beneficial. Displaying fewer results per SERP might also help keep peo-ple who are searching under time pressure stay focused. [1] I. Arapakis, X. Bai, and B. B. Cambazoglu. Impact of [2] N. Bhatti, A.
