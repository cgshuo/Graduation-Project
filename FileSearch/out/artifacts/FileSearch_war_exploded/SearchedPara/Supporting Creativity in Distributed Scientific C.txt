 We are interested in supporting creativity in distributed scientific communities through socio-technical interventions. Based on a synthetic literature analysis of creativity and collaborative groups, we present and justify three requirements for supporting creativity: support for divergent and convergent thinking, development of shared objectives, and reflexivity. We discuss our collaboratory prototype and its existing functionality to support creativity. We propose three design implications to support creativity in CSCW: integrate support for individual, dyadic, and group brainstorming, leverage cognitive conflict by preserving and reflecting on minority dissent, and support flexibility in granularity of planning. H.5.3 [ Group and Organization Interfaces ]: Collaborative computing and Computer-supported cooperative work.
 General Terms: Design. Keywords: Creativity, scientific collaboration, collaboratory, design rationale. Science is a social enterprise. The collaborative nature of science is emphasized by historians and philosophers of science, and sociologists interested in knowledge creation and diffusion (e.g., [18, 97]). History is replete with such examples (e.g., [100, 81]). A central aspect of and reason for scientific collaboration is creativity. Scientific creativity can be characterized as a process toward achieving an outcome recognized as innovative by the relevant community. Creativity does not happen inside one person X  X  head, but in the interaction between a person's thoughts and a socio-cultural context [19]. Creativity has been a traditional focus of study in psychology. More recently, it has been studied in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and specifically Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) under the rubric of distributed collaboration between scientific communities with collaborative infrastructures known as collaboratories. However, requirements for supporting creativity in distributed scientific communities have not been investigated directly, though there is preliminary evidence that collaboratory interactions facilitate scientific creativity (e.g., [88]). We are interested in evoking, enhancing, and sustaining creativity in distributed collaborations. Our context of study is distributed scientific communities, although our results can be applied to other types of knowledge work. We focus on creativity that involves everyday problem solving and routinized scientific work. In this paper, our goal is to investigate creativity requirements and their feasibility, effectiveness, and consequences of supporting everyday scientific collaboration with technology. To this end, we will propose and justify requirements to support creativity, drawing on diverse socio-psychological literature on creativity and groups. We will assess the feasibility of supporting these requirements by describing our collaboratory prototype and analyzing its current and future design support for creativity. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 motivates our investigation of creativity in context of HCI and CSCW. Section 3 reviews related work on scientific collaboratories and creativity support tools. Section 4 presents requirements and associated design rationale for supporting creativity. Section 5 describes our collaboratory prototype and its existing design features for creativity. Section 6 proposes design implications to better support creativity. Section 7 provides some concluding remarks. Creativity is critical to invention, innovation, and social progress at both the individual and societal levels [9, 93]. Individuals are able to refine and improve their own performance, and groups, organizations, and societal institutions are able to sustain their existence and grow if and only if they can adapt and solve problems creatively in ever-changing circumstances [29]. The modern era of creativity research can be traced to Guilford X  X  1950 presidential address to the American Psychological Association (APA). Creativity in psychological and social sciences continues to be studied and written about in professional books (e.g., [92, 5]) and journals (e.g., The Journal of Creative Behavior, since 1967; Creativity Research Journal, since 1988). Since the early 1990s, computer and information science and engineering (CISE) researchers have studied creativity in context of technology. The first symposium on Creativity and Cognition (C&amp;C) was held in 1993. Since then, C&amp;C has been held every three years, with ACM SIGCHI sponsoring the conferences in 1999, 2002, and 2005. A special issue of Communications of the ACM was published in October 2002 on Creativity and Interface . Creativity is an important focus of study in HCI and CSCW for several reasons [8, 25]. First, there are assertions that today X  X  knowledge workers can benefit from the use of software tools to enhance their creative strategies [9]. Second, existing tools for individual and collaborative work often contain interface elements that stymie creative efforts [7] and thus can be enhanced. Third, HCI and CSCW as inter-disciplinary fields [11] are conducive to more integrated investigations in traditionally diverse areas such as computing, psychology, art, music, and design among others. As a result of HCI and CSCW X  X  increasing interest in the study of creativity, the focus has shifted largely from automating creativity to augmenting creativity. In this paper, we are driven by our impetus to support distributed scientists in working more creatively and thus effectively with their peers around the world. We focus on scientific collaboration that involves everyday creativity or  X  X ittle C X  creativity [37], the sort that all of us evince in our daily lives. Although analyzing outstanding creative people (e.g., collaboration between Watson and his colleagues to discover the structure of DNA [100]) contributes toward establishing a framework for creativity [37], understanding creativity in the context of everyday activities is equally important for letting people become more productive and create better work products [31]. Collaboratories were a major National Science Foundation/National Research Council (USA) research infrastructure thrust during the 1990s. The vision of collaboratories is that access to special equipment (e.g., a supercomputer or a one-of-a-kind telescope) or special research sites (such as polar regions and the upper atmosphere) could be shared through the Internet, creating centers for geographically distributed scientists [105]. Over the past decade, the concept of collaboratory has developed to include sharing a wide variety of resources (all sort of datasets) and to in fact emphasize providing effective access to remote collaborators beyond email, for example, via chat and video conferencing [56, 30]. For example, Chin and Lansing [15] describe the Biological Sciences Collaboratory (BSC) that enables sharing of biological data and analyses through diverse capabilities such as metadata capture, electronic library notebooks, data organization views, analysis notes, and scientific workflow management. The BioCore collaboratory (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/biocore/) provides rich communication channels, both asynchronous and synchronous, such as notification systems and chatting with audio and visual cues. Other collections of collaboratories can be found at http://www.scienceofcollaboratories.org. The challenges and opportunities in creating collaboratory systems and their interfaces for enabling communications X  X oth the sharing of data, results, and the person-to-person interactions X  X elate directly to many aspects of HCI and CSCW research and development [4]. As a result of collaboratory development and HCI/CSCW research converging, a special issue of ACM Interactions was released in 1998, publishing four key articles that offered an in-depth look at collaboratories from an HCI perspective: telescope observations from a distance [54], the running of magnetic fusion experiments [14], remote participation in upper atmospheric research [77], and distributed tools for environmental molecular sciences [86]. The original justification for collaboratories was a matter of resource access and logistics than of enhancing creativity. However, it is surely plausible that having better access to instruments, research sites, datasets, and perhaps most importantly, to a better critical mass of one's professional colleagues ipso facto facilitates opportunities for greater scientific creativity. It would be useful to directly elicit requirements to support creativity in collaboratories and systematically develop creativity tools based on those requirements. Many collaborative tools for supporting the social creative process have been developed. For example, EVIDII allows designers to associate effective words and images, and then shows several visual representations of the relationships among designers, images, and words [70]. Showing different representations evokes individual designer X  X  creativity by using design knowledge or representations created by other designers in the community, thereby supporting collective creativity. Fischer [32] argued that distances (across physical, temporal, and technological dimensions) and diversity (across different cultures) are important sources for social creativity. He discussed several examples of collaborative environments to support creative processes. For example, in the Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory [2], participants collaboratively solve design problems of mutual interest such as urban transportation planning. The assumption is that complex design is a social creative process, and the integration of individual and social creativity takes place through face-to-face discussions in a shared construction space such as an electronic whiteboard. The Caretta system [96] supports f ace-to-face collaboration by integrating personal (for individual reflections) and shared spaces (for group discussions) to support intuitivism. Interactive art [38] is based on the premise that computational media enable people to operate at the source of the creative process by creating a pool of pixema, meaning individual pieces pr oduced by different artists, which can be exchanged to synthesize new paintings. CodeBroker [106] monitors software developers X  programming activities, infers their immediate task by analyzing semantic and syntactic information contained in their working products, and actively delivers task-relevant and personalized usable parts [33] from a repository created by decomposing existing software systems. This ensures awareness of each other X  X  work so that efforts are not duplicated and therefore, developers can be more creative. The afore-mentioned tools broadly support activities that are characteristic of creative HCI endeavor [87]: (1) Searching and browsing digital libraries; (2) Consulting with peers; (3) Visualizing data and processes; (4) Thinking by free associations; (5) Exploring solutions X  X hat-if tools; (6) Composing artifacts and performances; (7) Reviewing and replaying session histories; and (8) Disseminating results. Supporting such activities through creativity tools could reshape many forms of evolutionary creative work such as in scientific communities. However, design requirements for creativity support tools have been cursory in nature, not deeply rooted in the vast creativity literature that exists. For example, the eight design requirements elicited above from the Genex framework [87], although useful as a precursory research agenda for user interface design for creativity, are rooted largely in one theory (Theory of Flow [19]). The framework certainly provided a foundation for investigating creativity support tools in HCI, but the time is right to revisit and enhance it in context of CSCW and broader literature on collaborative creativity. Other HCI/CSCW research on creativity has attempted to carry the baton forward by extending the Genex design requirements. For example, Greene [42] asserts the need to support smooth exploration and experimentation in creativity tools. This implies that there should be an easy way to undo and redo all or part of one X  X  work, there should be no big penalties for mistakes, and there should be meaningful rewards for su ccess. Another study discusses the need for devising a shared language and developing a common understanding in inter-disciplinary collaboration [59]. Because creativity research is a fledging enterprise in CSCW, we wish to develop systematic methods for exploring the design space of s upporting creativity with collaborative technology. We actualize this by developing first-order approximations, in the form of requirements to support creativity, emerging from theoretical extensions [1]. Developing such first-order approximations will attempt to bridge the gap between what is required socially and what we can do technically to support creativity. If CSCW merely contributes  X  X ool toys X  without fully understanding and leveraging the theoretical underpinnings of how people really work in groups to be creative, it will have failed its intellectual mission, resulting in unusable systems [1]. In this section, we present three requirements for creativity with associated design rationale [67]. The design rationale derives from diverse theoretical and empirical investigations in socio-psychological literature on creativity and groups. Creativity in science, as in most other domains, involves both divergent and convergent thinking [58, 44]. Thus, we propose that creativity tools in computer-supported collaboration should support both these forms of thinking. Divergent thinking is the ability to generate a set of possible responses, ideas, options, or alternatives in response to an open-ended question, task, or challenge. Convergent thinking involves narrowing this set to one alternative, and then implementing this alternative by empirically testing and communicating it to the scientific community. Because the process of creativity involves a continuous interplay of and achieving a dynamic balance between divergent and convergent thinking [49], we do not treat them separately. Instead, from literature, we illustrate different ways that both divergent and convergent thinking can be facilitated, and eventually supported through technology. In his study of collaborative circles X  X  group of peers who share similar occupational goals and who, through long periods of dialogue and collaboration, negotiate a common vision that guides their work X  X arrell [28] argues that the bulk of a circle X  X  creative work (during divergent and convergent thinking) occurs within dyads that have developed close relationships. This result is different from traditional theories of creativity, which assert that creative work is most likely to be done by highly autonomous individuals working alone [55]. It is also important to note that Farrell X  X  result applies to everyday creativity, and not just to extraordinary dyads such as creative couples in science that are often cited as prime examples of creativity (e.g., Pierre and Marie Curie, Carl and Gerty Cori, etc [81]). Farrell says that dyad members engage in instrumental intimacy, characterized by trust, uninhibited exchange of ideas, and mutual support. New ideas, even though they may be experienced as coming from a third source, are more likely to emerge in creative dyads for several reasons [28, p. 158]. First, creativity is a form of deviance X  X oing something that authorities do not approve. A  X  X artner in crime X  enables a dyad member to neutralize the guilt and anxiety inherent in the creative process. Second, as a consequence of the mirroring and the identification with one another, each dyad member feels more cohesive, invests more in the self, and takes his/her own ideas more seriously. Third, the open exchange in free, often playful interactions between dyad members allows the linking of conscious and unconscious thoughts from both minds. Each member consequently uses the mind of the other as if it were an extension of his/her own. Finally, as each plays the role of critic for the other, the ideas are reworked into useful components for the emerging shared vision. Given that larger groups are less likely to elicit the levels of trust and support found in collaborative pairs [58], how can divergent and convergent thinking be facilitated in such groups? One well-established technique to support divergent thinking is group brainstorming. Brainstorming can compensate for motivation losses [91], which tend to increase in larger groups because there are fewer opportunities to participate productively, there is a sense that one X  X  contributions are not critical or identifiable, and there is greater depersonalization [3]. An interesting observation is that the process of brainstorming involving a group of scientists (who often use brainstorming effectively) differs significantly from a group of students (who typically do not) [24]. For example, contrary to traditional brainstorming discourse in which group members are discouraged from criticizing others X  ideas, evidence suggests that cognitive conflict within a scientific group can facilitate divergent thinking during brainstorming [58]. Group members often furnish new ideas that challenge group orthodoxy. Such challenges can facilitate learning, problem solving at the individual level, and decision making at the group level [52]. Evidence suggests that scientists are particularly likely to undergo conceptual change during laboratory meetings when they obtain surprising findings. This is not attributed to error discoveries, but rather to colleagues disagreeing with their interpretation [23] and a result of evolutionary  X  X inkering X  [24], a series of small changes that produce major changes in a concept. Therefore, it follows that cognitive conflict, or  X  X ppositional complementarity X  [53], has the potential to stimulate thoughtful consideration of new and creative ideas during brainstorming in scientific collaboration. As noted previously, for group creativity to occur, groups much reach consensus on which idea is best, that is, convergent thinking. When it comes to creativity, available literature repeatedly demonstrates that groups rarely achieve the level of the sum of the individuals [62]. Part of the reason for the suboptimal performance of groups is that members strongly desire consensus, even straining for consensus, as argued by Janis [51], under the rubric of groupthink. The general phenomenon is as follows. During consensus building, there is considerable evidence that discussion in a group of mostly like-minded members can extremize their views and enhance their confidence in those views, a phenomenon known as polarization [34, 68]. This results in premature movement to consensus [46], thereby reducing the likelihood of creativity. There is evidence that majorities stimulate less novel or original thinking [73]. Given the problems associated with homogeneity, consensus, and majority views for both the quality of group decision making and creative idea generation, one antidote appears to be dissent [73] rooted in minority influence theory. Based on such literature, it has been shown that dissent is a stimulus to divergent, convergent, and thus, creative thinking . Minority dissent stimulates divergent thought, manifested in the search for information, the use of strategies, thoughts about the issue, detection of novel solutions, and creativity of solutions [72]. Studies have invariably validated this basic theoretical premise (e.g., [20, 99]). Some studies have even shown that minority dissent, even when wrong, stimulates a search for information on all sides of the issue [74], and thus, thought is directed at more alternatives [60, 75]. We also argue that dissent can facilitate convergent thinking. Studies have demonstrated that minority dissent stimulates a reappraisal of a situation [73, p. 73]. In general, people do not assume that the minority view is correct. However, during convergent thinking, when a group is narrowing a set of alternatives to a single idea, the minority X  X  consistency of maintaining his or her dissenting view raises doubt about the majority position [73, p. 78]. Such an interaction evinces more complexity of thought, reevaluation of the majority position, and subsequently leads the group to make better decisions [98]. In general, studies (e.g., [98, 99]) have consistently shown that minority dissent can stimulate creative solutions to problems. For example, Nemeth et al. [75] ran a simulated study of a work setting with two groups, one that was exposed to a dissenting opinion and the other not. When asked to generate solutions, the group exposed to minority dissent came up with more creative solutions than the other control group (no dissent). Another study by De Dreu and West [21] on existing organizations shows that dissent increases innovation in work teams but primarily when individuals participate in decision making. One condition for creativity flow is having clarity of goals [19, p. 114]. We propose that creativity tools in computer-supported collaboration should support development of shared objectives that engenders clarity of goals. Shared objectives imply a group vision of the goals of its work that members wish to achieve. In context of group innovation, clarity of group objectives is likely to facilitate innovation by enabling focused development of new ideas, which can be filtered with greater precision than if group objectives are unclear [104, p. 261]. When group objectives are shared or distributed, it is critical that all members hold the same understanding of the goals, and that they are also aware of how others on the group perceive the situation [48]. Developing shared objectives involves group members to leverage their domain-specific knowledge, which does not always lead to creativity but does appear to be a relatively necessary condition for it (see discussion in [76, pp. 409-410]). This process also involves pooling information effectively [90] with high levels of interaction among group members. This can lead to cross-fertilization of perspectives that can spawn creativity and innovation [69, 78]. In general, high participation in decision making (such as when group objectives are being formulated) means less resistance to change and therefore greater likelihood of innovations being implemented [16, 57]. Theoretically, development of shared and clear objectives will facilitate innovation only if members are committed to the goals of the group [104, p. 261]. This is b ecause strong goal commitment is necessary to maintain group member persistence for implementation in the face of resistance among other organizational members. For example, in a study of 418 project teams [80], it was found that a clearly stated mission was the only factor that predicted success at all stages of the innovation process. Not having a shared commitment to common group objectives can result in breakdowns within local, global, and contextual group dynamics [3]. For example, lack of coordination between members (breakdown within local dynamics), greater disparity between a member X  X  commitment to a group and the group X  X  commitment to that particular member (breakdown within global dynamics), and/or lack of safety in the work environment (breakdown within contextual dynamics) can lead to dissolution of a group. Thus, due to a lack of shared vision of the group goals, such forces of group disintegration are likely to emerge (or become more apparent) and subsequently inhibit creativity [104, p. 261]. An interesting finding from creativity literature is that even the intention to develop shared objectives is critical for creative endeavor . Henle [47], for example, argues that we cannot find creative ideas by intentionally looking for them. She also argues, however, that if we are not receptive to them, they will not come X  X hat their occurrence requires an appropriate attitude on our part. This attitude is typically manifested in the intention to be creative, which is important for creative activity. Nickerson [76, p. 408] also argues that purpose is essential to creative expression, and that a pre-requisite for purpose is intention. He broadly defines purpose as a deep and abiding intention to develop one X  X  creative potential X  X  long-term interest, on cognitive and emotional levels, in some form of creative expression. Studies have corroborated the importance of purpose in this long-term sense (e.g., [22, 79]). Knowing how well one is doing is essential to being creative [19, p. 115]. In context of groups, this means the extent to which members collectively reflect on the group X  X  objectives, strategies, and processes as well as their wider organizations and environments, and adapt them accordingly. This is known as reflexivity [103, p. 559], a process that creativity tools should support in computer-supported collaboration. Group reflexivity consists of three elements: reflection, planning, and action (adaptation) [104]. Reflection, in general, consists of attention, awareness, monitoring, and evaluation of the object of reflection [103], with evaluation particularly being stressed as an important constituent in creative thinking [84]. Specifically, reflection is a process to ruminate over the object of reflection deeply in more detail. It is about critical thinking, which is thinking that is focused, disciplined, logical, and constrained [76, p. 397]. In some sense, reflection is a form of convergent thinking X  X t evaluates what divergent thinking offers, subjects the possibilities to criteria of acceptability, and selects some among them for further consideration [76, p. 399]. Planning is one of the potential consequences of the indeterminacy of reflection, because during this indeterminacy, courses of action can be contemplated, intentions formed, and plans developed, and the potential for carrying them out is built up [104]. Collaborative planning, as conceptualized by Rogoff [83], involves foresight and improvisation, and is inherently a creative process. Planning typically involves top-down goal decomposition with development and ordering of plan fragments [85], interleaving with the other two elements of reflexivity (reflection and action) [64], and opportunistic plan revision [94]. High reflexivity exists when planning is characterized by greater detail, inclusiveness of potential problems, hierarchical ordering, and long-as well as short-range planning [104]. More detailed intentions or plans are more likely to lead to innovative implementations [35]. For example, Gollwitzer X  X  work [39] suggests that goal-directed behavior or innovation will be initiated when the group has articulated implementation intentions. This is because planning creates conceptual readiness for, and guides group members X  attention toward, relevant opportunities for action and means to accomplish the gr oup X  X  goal. Action, the third element of reflexivity, refers to goal-directed behaviors relevant to achieving the desired changes in group objectives, strategies, processes, organizations, or environments identified by the group during the stage of reflection [104]. Overall, as a result of reflexivity, a group X  X  reality is continually renegotiated during interactions between group members [104, p. 264]. Understandings negotiated in one exchange among group members may be drawn on a variety of ways to inform subsequent discussions and offer the possibility of helpful and creative transformations and meanings [6]. For example, research with BBC television program production groups, whose work fundamentally requires creativity and innovation, provides support for these propositions [13]. Integrating seamless access to tools, collaborators, and their activities, are desirable requirements to facilitate creativity in collaborative environments to effectively support human-to-human communication [8, 87]. Here, we describe our prototype of a collaboratory infrastructure and system, and talk about existing tools that support the process of creativity in an integrated way. Our collaboratory prototype is known as BRIDGE (Basic Resources for Integrated Distributed Group Environments; http://bridgetools.sourceforge.net) [36]. The BRIDGE infrastructure is seamlessly integrated with browser-based wiki-style asynchronous editing and also supports synchronous shared editing of complex documents through replicated objects [50]. Replicated objects are objects that are retrieved by multiple collaborating sessions and whose state is kept synchronized when any replica is changed. The underlying code base is implemented in Java using software design patterns and components. For accessibility and familiarity, BRIDGE client systems look and behave like a normal web site, with all content rendered as HTML and images. Simple forms of authoring are supported. Each page has an  X  X dit X  link which supports editing and new page creation using a simple shorthand notation that requires no external authoring tools or knowledge of HTML. This is designed to present the kind of easy transition from browsing to authoring, and from authoring to collaborative authoring, which is supported in similar wiki-based systems. Each BRIDGE web page also has a  X  X ull Editor X  link that launches an interactive Java-based client. The Java client supports interactive authoring functionality that is not possible or practical using HTML-based forms. Further, this client supports synchronous, distributed collaboration between users on shared artifacts, such as drawings, documents, data tables and charts, and interactive maps. Text chat is a fundamental communication tool that, in the context of long-term collaboration, has both synchronous and asynchronous interaction modes. The chat is persistent, and so collaborators who join a shared session late or have missed the session completely can benefit from reviewing the content. For those who participated in the chat synchronously, a persistent copy will be valuable as a transcript, perhaps serving as a record of task decomposition or other negotiation between group members. Finally, groups may decide to use the chat tool as a message board for fully asynchronous conversations. There is multitude support for graphical content generation. This includes drawing tools like a collaborative concept map, paintbrush-like editor for shared construction of drawings, and functionality for creating interactive maps (panning and zooming features) that can be jointly annotated. BRIDGE also provides table and charting tools, supporting basic data management and information visualization capabilities. Account management tools allow users to manage custom sets of restricted accounts with desired scope and privileges. One notable characteristic of BRIDGE is its support for awareness. Social awareness [26] is provided through a user list that indicates their activity (active vs. inactive). Workspace awareness [45] is supported by viewing synchronous changes to shared artifacts. For example, two group members could collaboratively co-construct a shared document and see each other X  X  changes synchronously. Changes to shared artifacts can also be seen asynchronously through version histories. To be creative in a social setting, a collaborator needs to be aware of others and their work (e.g., [70]) to establish and maintain a shared background of understanding. BRIDGE supports coordination and planning with activity awareness [12]: awareness of project work that supports group performance in complex tasks over long-term endeavors directed at major goals. A timeline interface provides a document history for a project along with a means for overlaying projects events like deadlines. As a user starts work on a shared document, a copy of the previous version is automatically stored for future reference. Figure 1 is a screenshot that illustrates many of these features. Among many tools available in BRIDGE, the ones illustrated above generally support creativity in context of collaboratively accessing peers and their activities, planning, reflection on work, and idea generation. The three requirements to support creativity with their design rationale (section 4) suggest broader strategies to better support creative endeavors in distributed, computer-supported collaborations. At the most general level, the approach we are pursuing has three design heuristics. First, we are trying to integrate support for individual, dyadic, and group brainstorming . This approach contrasts with the strategy of just supporting group brainstorming. Second, we are trying to leverage c ognitive conflict for generating creative ideas by preserving and subsequently reflecting on minority dissent . This is different from existing approaches of typically supporting majority-driven consensus. Third, we are trying to support flexibility in the granularity of planning , instead of constraining planning to some specific level of detail. During the creative work stage, group members alternate between times when they work alone, in pairs, and times when they meet as a group [28, p. 24]. Therefore, supporting these different brainstorming modalities and the alterations between them seems feasible. In BRIDGE, a user can provide privileges to others for sharing (viewing and/or editing) an artifact such as a concept map. These privileges can be issued to individuals or groups (e.g., members of a research lab). In this way, the concept map for instance can be made accessible to individuals, dyads, or a gr oup comprising any number of individuals. A brainstorming tool should also allow switching modalities while maintaining the content of the previous and forthcoming brainstorming sessions. For instance, switching from a group brainstorming session to an individual session should preserve the collaborative group work, and then create a newer version for individual brainstorming session. Maintaining history of brainstorming sessions, which would be bookmarked at the times of modality switching, would allow users to refer back to previous versions, assess changes temporally, and keep track of who did what. Such session histories would facilitate the metacognitive process of reflection and self-awareness [87], and establishment of a reward structure for making work visible [95]. Brainstorming techniques X  X uch as drawing concept maps, affinity diagrams, or storyboarding X  X re often codified as graphical visualizations of knowledge. One way to integrate support for individual, dyadic, and group brainstorming is to use role-specific multiple view visualizations [17]. Given that breaking problems down into components and looking at problems from different angles facilitates effective brainstorming and thus creativity [58], multiple view visualizations could then possibly represent different perspectives on how a problem should be broken down, not just from the role of a group but also the perspectives of individual and dyadic roles. For example, using the notion of public and private spaces [41], an individual could add ideas to the group brainstorming view privately, and later propagate these ideas to the group through the shared view. Distributed scientific collaboration will typically involve long-term creative endeavors, manifesting more asynchronous collaborations than synchronous. In f ace-to-face brainstorming, empirical evidence suggests that the specific mental activity in which a brainstormer is engaged during breaks is important [65]. Contents of short-term memory during a brainstorming break affect an individual X  X  post-break brainstorming performance. If the activity performed during the break does not allow the task-relevant ideas and concepts to remain active in short-term memory, then the relevant categories will have to be reactivated following the break. For long-term and distributed scientific collaboration, which involves all three modalities of brainstorming (individual, dyadic, and group), supporting the process of ideation continuously is especially critical. One way to address this is to use notification systems to inform individuals, dyads, and groups of relevant changes to a shared artifact during the breaks between asynchronous interactions. These notifications A would alert users via email or other action-evoking stimuli such as an awareness feature (e.g., popup alerts in a MOO [27]). As a result, users would possibly react to the changes or at least think about the history of previous interactions, which would provide some level of cognitively preserving and tinkering prior brainstorming sessions. Moderate task-related conflict and minority dissent in a participative climate will lead to innovation by encouraging debate and to consideration of alternative interpretations of information available, leading to integrated and creative solutions. It seems that the social processes in groups n ecessary for minority dissent to influence the innovation process are characterized by high levels of team member interaction, influence over decision making, and information sharing [104, p. 263]. Preserving cognitive conflict and reflecting on minority dissent consists of two broad support mechanisms: documenting dissenting views and then finding these views during later consideration. A design feature that allows coding or flagging with an evocative, visual representation (e.g., user X  X  avatar, color code) could be used to tag a dissenting opinion in a shared workspace. The shared workspace could represent a structured asynchronous discourse (in [10]) where group members can annotate discussion items. This scheme is somewhat similar to ones implemented in Issue-Based Information Systems (IBIS) developed by Horst Rittel [82], where opinions could be tagged. Part of the difficulty with IBIS was the severe cognitive overhead dictated by the high degree of structure. User-directed annotations with open coding or flagging can alleviate such problems. Annotations on a shared information repository, in addition to just tagging dissenting opinions, reinforce the idea of personal perspectives in the group context [89]. Stahl and Herrmann [89] assert that during negotiation in computer-supported collaborations, it should always be possible for users to r eact to each other, at least by commenting. This maintains at least a partial overlap of their contents (both minority and majority views) that is key to reaching successful mutual understanding and coordination. As mentioned before, part of the advantage of preserving dissenting opinions is to reappraise a specific situation at some later point in the long-term, asynchronous activity of distributed scientific collaboration. Viewing these cognitive conflicts temporally, say using a timeline view as in BRIDGE, can help to reevaluate orthodoxy especially at later stages of the group project when members tend to lose objectivity. Even the consideration of minority dissent, without implementation, can help strengthen the autotelic experience of group members during the creative work process (see [19, pp. 121-123] for discussion of autotelic experience in creativity). Although more detailed plans can lead to creativity, imposing such constraints in collaborative systems can be problematic. For example, one of the classical findings in CSCW is that workflow systems for planning tasks are successful in supporting structured activity [43], and otherwise may be too rigid, can potentially stymie creativity, and users often find ways to work around them. We argue that a flexible, more opportunistic and less imposing, planning tool with different levels of detail would facilitate creativity. Planning can be conceptualized as strategic and operational [63]. Strategic planning refers to a macro or purpose level of planning. It is knowledge-and intention-based: that is, it is driven by members X  intentions, preferences, and information. Operational planning involves hierarchical, temporal, referential, and technical structuring.  X  X hat will be done X  (hierarchical) specifies the consequence of having intentions in strategic planning to develop shared objectives for collection action.  X  X hen X  (temporal) refers to the sequence of tasks.  X  X y whom X  (referential) is about leveraging social resources in the coordination network, within and outside of the group. Finally,  X  X ow X  (technical) refers to the division of labor and allocation of roles in the network to fulfill group objectives. Separating and supporting different levels of planning can allow flexibility in planning tools. Instead of a Gantt chart supporting all planning activities, different representations for different levels of planning seems more plausible. For example, in our BRIDGE collaboratory, the timeline provides a temporal representation of plans, whereas the concept map supports a hierarchical way of structuring plans. The technical structuring of plans is supported through a shared workspace that corresponds to the planning milestones. Each milestone in the timeline can be specified in detail within the workspace, which s upports collaborative discussion and writing among group members. Not all planning is explicit [63, p. 127] because structuring of actions (i.e., planning) often has a basis in traditions and history, either of that group or of groups to which its members have previously belonged. One design feature to support the referential level of operational planning is to incorporate a social network as part of the planning workflow system. Our argumentation for incorporating a social network is based on two phenomena. First, scientists use digital library sources (e.g., ACM digital library, CiteSeer) to access and use scientific artifacts in their own endeavors. Second, these scientific artifacts are not just tangible and passive resources. They embody social and active intellectual entities with respect to the scientists who created these artifacts. Thus, social relationships and interactions among scientists in a community of interest or practice [102], at the very least, influence the development and operationalization of plans. This is because plans conti nuously change along with the situation [94], and in scientific collaboration, an essential part of the situation are scientific peers and the knowledge they generate. It is then reasonable to expect that during scientific collaboration and specifically planning, collaborators not only want to leverage strong ties in their group (members of the group) but also weak ties outside of the group (larger scientific community) [40]. Referential planning should not be narrowly construed as  X  X ho does what in the group X  but more broadly as  X  X ho can be leveraged as a social resource within and outside of the group X . Thus, social networks can enhance the depth of planning and articulation of work by facilitating horizontal informational flow across formal, recognized boundaries [101]. Our goal is to design socio-technical interventions to support creativity in context of distributed, computer-supported scientific collaborations. Based on a synthetic analysis of diverse literature on creativity, groups, and their associated domains of study (organizational theory, collaborative problem solving, etc), we presented three requirements to support creativity. These requirements appropriately update and enhance existing work in HCI/CSCW to support creativity (e.g., Shneiderman X  X  Genex framework [87]) because of their interdisciplinary theory-based and empirical-rooted design rationale. These requirements are by no means exhaustive, but do represent a systematic effort toward developing first-order approximations to meet the intellectual challenge of CSCW [1]. Further, we chose these specific requirements among others because of their potential to be mediated and supported through collaborative technology. For example, other conditions for creativity are diverse group compositions and supportive work environments, but they do not fall under the rubric of socio-technical phenomena. We also presented our collaboratory infrastructure and system, and existing functionality to support creativity. We then proposed design implications as discussion items and future agenda in this line of research based on our earlier requirements for creativity. We plan to explore these design proposals in our collaboratory. More broadly, they present technical challenges for the CSCW community in assessing the design space for supporting creativity. More research is obviously needed in this emerging domain. In addition to theory development and design of creativity support tools, there is a dire need to formulate and codify measures for evaluating creativity in computer-supported collaborations. We need to go beyond existing traditional methods to evaluate creativity support tools in collaboratories (e.g., object-action analysis [66] to evaluate UARC [61]; artifact analysis to evaluate the BSC [15]). To this end, a promising direction is to develop multi-method measurement approaches, grounded in theories of collaborative activity and creativity (for analogous argumentation with respect to usability evaluation issues in CSCW, see [71]).
