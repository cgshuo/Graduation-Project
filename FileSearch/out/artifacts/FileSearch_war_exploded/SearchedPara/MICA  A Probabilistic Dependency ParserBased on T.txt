 This application note presents a freely avail-able parser, MICA (Marseille-INRIA-Columbia-AT&amp;T). 1 MICA has several key characteristics that make it appealing to researchers in NLP who need an off-the-shelf parser.  X  MICA returns a deep dependency parse, in which dependency is defined in terms of lex-ical predicate-argument structure, not in terms of surface-syntactic features such as subject-verb agreement. Function words such as auxiliaries and determiners depend on their lexical head, and strongly governed prepositions (such as to for give ) are treated as co-heads rather than as syntactic heads in their own right. For example, John is giving books to Mary gets the following analysis (the arc label is on the terminal).
The arc labels for the three arguments John , books , and Mary do not change when the sentence is passivized or Mary undergoes dative shift.  X  MICA is based on an explicit phrase-structure tree grammar extracted from the Penn Treebank. Therefore, MICA can associate dependency parses with rich linguistic information such as voice, the presence of empty subjects (PRO), wh -movement, and whether a verb heads a relative clause.  X  MICA is fast (450 words per second plus 6 sec-onds initialization on a standard high-end machine on sentences with fewer than 200 words) and has state-of-the-art performance (87.6% unlabeled de-pendency accuracy, see Section 5).  X  MICA consists of two processes: the supertag-ger, which associates tags representing rich syntac-tic information with the input word sequence, and the actual parser, which derives the syntactic struc-ture from the n -best chosen supertags. Only the su-pertagger uses lexical information, the parser only sees the supertag hypotheses.  X  MICA returns n-best parses for arbitrary n ; parse trees are associated with probabilities. A packed forest can also be returned.  X  MICA is freely available 2 , easy to install under Linux, and easy to use. (Input is one sentence per line with no special tokenization required.)
There is an enormous amount of related work, and we can mention only the most salient, given space constraints. Our parser is very similar to the work of (Shen and Joshi, 2005). They do not em-ploy a supertagging step, and we do not restrict our trees to spinal projections. Other parsers using su-pertagging include the LDA of Bangalore and Joshi (1999), the CCG-based parser of Clark and Curran (2004), and the constraint-based approach of Wang and Harper (2004). Widely used dependency parsers which generate deep dependency representations in-clude Minipar (Lin, 1994), which uses a declarative grammar, and the Stanford parser (Levy and Man-ning, 2004), which performs a conversion from a standard phrase-structure parse. All of these systems generate dependency structures which are slightly different from MICA X  X , so that direct comparison is difficult. For comparison purposes, we therefore use the MALT parser generator (Nivre et al., 2004), which allows us to train a dependency parser on our own dependency structures. MALT has been among the top performers in the CoNLL dependency pars-ing competitions. Supertags are elementary trees of a lexicalized tree grammar such as a Tree-Adjoining Gram-mar (TAG) (Joshi, 1987). Unlike context-free gram-mar rules which are single level trees, supertags are multi-level trees which encapsulate both predicate-argument structure of the anchor lexeme (by includ-ing nodes at which its arguments must substitute) and morpho-syntactic constraints such as subject-verb agreement within the supertag associated with the anchor. There are a number of supertags for each lexeme to account for the different syntactic trans-formations (relative clause, wh -question, passiviza-tion etc.). For example, the verb give will be associ-ated with at least these two trees, which we will call tdi and tdi-dat. (There are also many other trees.)  X 
Supertagging is the task of disambiguating among the set of supertags associated with each word in a sentence, given the context of the sentence. In order to arrive at a complete parse, the only step remaining after supertagging is establishing the at-tachments among the supertags. Hence the result of supertagging is termed as an  X  X lmost parse X  (Banga-lore and Joshi, 1999).
 The set of supertags is derived from the Penn Treebank using the approach of Chen (2001). This extraction procedure results in a supertag set of 4,727 supertags and about one million words of su-pertag annotated corpus. We use 950,028 annotated words for training (Sections 02-21) and 46,451 (Sec-tion 00) annotated words for testing in our exper-iments. We estimate the probability of a tag se-quence directly as in discriminative classification approaches. In such approaches, the context of the word being supertagged is encoded as features for the classifier. Given the large scale multiclass la-beling nature of the supertagging task, we train su-pertagging models as one-vs-rest binary classifica-tion problems. Detailed supertagging experiment re-sults are reported in (Bangalore et al., 2005) which we summarize here. We use the lexical, part-of-speech attributes from the left and right context in a 6 -word window and the lexical, orthographic (e.g. capitalization, prefix, suffix, digit) and part-of-speech attributes of the word being supertagged. Crucially, this set does not use the supertags for the words in the history. Thus during decoding the su-pertag assignment is done locally and does not need a dynamic programming search. We trained a Max-ent model with such features using the labeled data set mentioned above and achieve an error rate of 11.48% on the test set. MICA grammars are extracted in a three steps pro-cess. In a first step, a Tree Insertion Grammar (TIG) (Schabes and Waters, 1995) is extracted from the treebank, along with a table of counts. This is the grammar that is used for supertagging, as described in Section 2. In a second step, the TIG and the count table are used to build a PCFG. During the last step, the PCFG is  X  X pecialized X  in order to model more finely some lexico-syntactic phenomena. The sec-ond and third steps are discussed in this section.
The extracted TIG is transformed into a PCFG which generates strings of supertags as follows. Ini-tial elementary trees (which are substituted) yield rules whose left hand side is the root category of the elementary tree. Left (respectively right) aux-iliary trees (the trees for which the foot node is the left (resp. right) daughter of the root) give birth to rules whose left-hand side is of the form X l (resp. X ), where X is the root category of the elementary tree. The right hand side of each rule is built during a top down traversal of the corresponding elemen-tary tree. For every node of the tree visited, a new symbol is added to the right hand side of rule, from left to right, as follows:  X  The anchor of the elementary tree adds the su-pertag (i.e., the name of the tree), which is a terminal symbol, to the context-free rule.  X  A substitution node in the elementary tree adds its nonterminal symbol to the context-free rule.  X  A interior node in the elementary tree at which adjunction may occur adds to the context-free rule node X  X  nonterminal symbol, and l (resp. r) indicates whether it is a left (resp. right) adjunction. Each interior node is visited twice, the first time from the left, and then from the right. A set of non-lexicalized rules (i.e., rules that do not generate a terminal sym-bol) allow us to generate zero or more trees anchored by X l from the symbol X  X  adjunction, and the second adjunction are modeled explicitly in the grammar and the associated prob-abilistic model, while the third and all subsequent adjunctions are modeled together.

This conversion method is basically the same as that presented in (Schabes and Waters, 1995), ex-cept that our PCFG models multiple adjunctions at the same node by positions (a concern Schabes and Waters (1995) do not share, of course). Our PCFG construction differs from that of Hwa (2001) in that she does not allow multiple adjunction at one node (Schabes and Shieber, 1994) (which we do since we are interested in the derivation structure as a repre-sentation of linguistic dependency). For more in-formation about the positional model of adjunction and a discussion of an alternate model, the  X  X igram model X , see (Nasr and Rambow, 2006).

Tree tdi from Section 2 gives rise to the following rule (where tdi and tCO are terminal symbols and the rest are nonterminals): S  X  S  X 
The probabilities of the PCFG rules are estimated using maximum likelihood. The probabilistic model refers only to supertag names, not to words. In the basic model, the probability of the adjunction or sub-stitution of an elementary tree (the daughter) in an-other elementary tree (the mother) only depends on the nonterminal, and does not depend on the mother nor on the node on which the attachment is per-formed in the mother elementary tree. It is well known that such a dependency is important for an adequate probabilistic modelling of syntax. In order to introduce such a dependency, we condition an at-tachment on the mother and on the node on which the attachment is performed, an operation that we call mother specialization. Mother specialization is performed by adding to all nonterminals the name of the mother and the address of a node. The special-ization of a grammar increase vastly the number of symbols and rules and provoke severe data sparse-ness problems, this is why only a subset of the sym-bols are specialized. S
YNTAX (Boullier and Deschamp, 1988) is a sys-tem used to generate lexical and syntactic analyzers (parsers) (both deterministic and non-deterministic) for all kind of context-free grammars (CFGs) as well as some classes of contextual grammars. It has been under development at INRIA for several decades. S YNTAX handles most classes of determin-istic (unambiguous) grammars (LR, LALR, RLR) as well as general context-free grammars. The non-deterministic features include, among others, an Earley-like parser generator used for natural lan-guage processing (Boullier, 2003).

Like most S YNTAX Earley-like parsers, the archi-tecture of MICA X  X  PCFG-based parser is the follow-ing:  X  The Earley-like parser proper computes a shared parse forest that represents in a factorized (polyno-mial) way all possible parse trees according to the underlying (non-probabilistic) CFG that represents the TIG;  X  Filtering and/or decoration modules are applied on the shared parse forest; in MICA X  X  case, an n -best module is applied, followed by a dependency extractor that relies on the TIG structure of the CFG.
The Earley-like parser relies on Earley X  X  algo-rithm (Earley, 1970). However, several optimiza-tions have been applied, including guiding tech-niques (Boullier, 2003), extensive static (offline) computations over the grammar, and efficient data structures. Moreover, Earley X  X  algorithm has been extended so as to handle input DAGs (and not only sequences of forms). A particular effort has been made to handle huge grammars (over 1 million symbol occurrences in the grammar), thanks to ad-vanced dynamic lexicalization techniques (Boullier and Sagot, 2007). The resulting efficiency is satisfy-ing: with standard ambiguous NLP grammars, huge shared parse forest (over 10 10 trees) are often gener-ated in a few dozens of milliseconds.

Within MICA, the first module that is applied on top of the shared parse forest is S YNTAX  X  X  n -best module. This module adapts and implements the al-gorithm of (Huang and Chiang, 2005) for efficient n -best trees extraction from a shared parse forest. In practice, and within the current version of MICA, this module is usually used with n = 1 , which iden-tifies the optimal tree w.r.t. the probabilistic model embedded in the original PCFG; other values can also be used. Once the n -best trees have been ex-tracted, the dependency extractor module transforms each of these trees into a dependency tree, by ex-ploiting the fact that the CFG used for parsing has been built from a TIG. We compare MICA to the MALT parser. Both parsers are trained on sections 02-21 of our de-pendency version of the WSJ PennTreebank, and tested on Section 00, not counting true punctuation.  X  X redicted X  refers to tags (PTB-tagset POS and su-pertags) predicted by our taggers;  X  X old X  refers to the gold POS and supertags. We tested MALT using only POS tags (MALT-POS), and POS tags as well as 1-best supertags (MALT-all). We provide unla-beled ( X  X n X ) and labeled ( X  X b X ) dependency accu-racy (%). As we can see, the predicted supertags do not help MALT. MALT is significantly slower than MICA, running at about 30 words a second (MICA: 450 words a second).
