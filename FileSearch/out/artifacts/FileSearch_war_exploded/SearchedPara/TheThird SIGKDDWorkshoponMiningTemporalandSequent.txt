 In this short report, we provide a summary of the results, issues, and researc h directions on mining temp oral and se-quen tial data, discussed in TDM-2004, held in conjunction with the 10-th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Disco very and Data Mining (KDD-2004) on Au-gust 22, 2004 in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. This workshop is the third on the topic of Temporal Data Mining following the two successful workshops held at KDD-2001 and KDD-2002. This year's title \Workshop on Min-ing Temporal and Sequen tial Data" re X  X cts our initiativ e to broaden the scope.
 Though much of the data in large databases either have explicit or implicit timing/ordering information, many of the successful KDD applications still involve  X nding static relationships from these databases. Examples of temp o-ral/sequen tial data include  X nancial data, data from manu-facturing plants, data obtained from scien ti X c and engineer-ing processes, sensor data, stream data, weather and geo-physical data, tra X c- X  X  w data from physical and electronic networks, multi-media and speech data, genomic and other bio-informatics data, brain imaging data, etc. Many of the systems we treat as static, whether the world-wide-w eb or the human brain, are truly dynamic. Mining of data from these systems would be much easier if the temp oral/dynamic nature of these systems is directly addressed.
 The goal of this workshop is to bring together researc hers and practitioners from multi-disciplinary  X elds, including temp oral data mining, time-series analysis, statistics, se-quen tial pattern analysis, Web analysis, biomedical researc h, and industrial applications, critically evaluate the need for mining temp oral and sequen tial data, and identify promising technologies and metho dologies for making real-time mining of these data possible.
 Based on the above motiv ation, submissions of the papers on the following topics are invited.  X 
We would like to thank General Motors Corp oration for help with printing of the workshop notes. y
Work supp orted in part by the U.S. National Science Foun-dation NSF IIS-02-09199 and NSF IIS-03-08001. The workshop receiv ed a good number of submissions. Based on the critical evaluation by the program committee, we have  X nally compiled an interesting  X nal workshop program, which consists of 8 selected researc h papers for workshop presen tation, 7 selected papers for poster presen tation, one invited talk on \ Data Mining for Financial Time Series: Learning to Trade via Dir ect Reinfor cement " by John Moody (International Computer Science Institute, Berk eley), and one  X nal panel discussion on \ Wher e should TDM go? " co-ordinated by Unnikrishnan, with the following Panelists: Heikki Mannila, Doug Martin, Vipin Kumar, Eamonn Keogh, Jiawei Han, and Ramasam y Uthurusam y.
 The rich program of the workshop attracted good atten-dance, with lively presen tations, posters, and heated dis-cussions. Based on the workshop discussion, we have the following conclusion related to this researc h theme: Good progress has been made in recen t years on time-series sim-ilarit y searc h, mining sequen tial, temp oral, spatiotemp oral, time-series, and stream data, and their applications. How-ever, this is still an importan t, dynamic and fast grow-ing sub X eld in data mining since new types of time-and sequence-related data sets related to sensor and stream data, biomedical data, and spatiotemp oral data, as well as new application demands have been the driving force for the fast progress in this  X eld. We predict the dynamic growth and  X  X urishing researc h on this theme in the years to come. We would like to thank the workshop program committee mem bers for their service, listed as follows: Rakesh Agra wal, Vasant Dhar, Christos Faloutsos, Usama Fayyad, Johannes Gehrk e, Joydeep Ghosh, C. Lee Giles, Eamonn Keogh, Vipin Kumar, Heikki Mannila, R. Douglas Martin, Raymond T. Ng, Arlindo Oliveira, Jian Pei, Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, John Roddick, P. S. Sastry , Padhraic Smyth, Ramakrishnan Srikant, and Benjamin Wah.
