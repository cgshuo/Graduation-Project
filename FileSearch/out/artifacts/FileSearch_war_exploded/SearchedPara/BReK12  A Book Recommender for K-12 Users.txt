 Ideally, students in K-12 grade levels can turn to book rec-ommenders to locate books that match their interests. Ex-isting book recommenders, however, fail to take into account the readability levels of their users, and hence their recom-mendations may be unsuitable for the users. To address this issue, we introduce BReK 12, a recommender that tar-gets K-12 users and prioritizes the reading level of its users in suggesting books of interest. Empirical studies conducted using the Bookcrossing dataset show that BReK 12 outper-forms a number of existing recommenders (developed for general users) in identifying books appealing to K-12 users.

Reading, an essential skill required for acquiring knowl-edge, is an integral part of the educational system. It is imperative to encourage the reading habit of K-12 students early on, since research studies have confirmed the enormous influence of reading on students X  development as learners and members of the society [7]. Finding books that chil-dren/youth are interested in, however, is not a trivial task due to the diversity of topics covered in books, needless to say the huge volume of books available these days.
A recommendation system on books that assists children/ youths in finding books of interest to them is a valuable asset to the age group. Existing book recommenders, however, are developed with a general audience in mind and ignore the literacy skill of each individual user. As a result, even if (the topic of) a book B recommended to a user U matches U  X  X  interests, B might include complex (basic, respectively) content, which is beyond (below, respectively) the literary level of U and thus is unappealing, i.e., irrelevant, to U
To address the design fault on excluding the literary is-sue in existing book recommendation systems, we introduce BReK 12, a unique recommender tailored to K-12 users. Be-sides considering diverse content descriptors and item-item similarity to identify books appealing to U , BReK 12 de-termines the readability level of books to be recommended based on well-known readability formulas.

We have conducted an empirical study to verify that by considering the readability level of books and its users, in addition to the content and item-item similarity measures, BReK 12 recommends books that are more suitable for K-12 users than the ones suggested by existing recommenders. BReK 12 recommends books for a K-12 user U based on U  X  X  interest on a given book B and the following measures:
Content Similarity: BReK 12 computes the content similarity between B and each candidate book CB to be considered for recommendation, denoted C Sim ( CB , B ), as defined in Equation 1. B ( CB , respectively) is represented as a set of keywords 1 S B ( S CB , respectively) that appear in either the title , description ,or tag cloud of B ( CB spectively). Each keyword in the set is associated with its corresponding frequency of occurrence in the title, descrip-tion, and tag cloud of the book. The title of B ( CB ,re-spectively) characterizes its subject matter, whereas its tag cloud captures user-defined keywords posted under social bookmarking sites that describe the content of B ( CB ,re-spectively) and its description provides an overview of its content, which is often created by its author(s). C where n ( m , respectively) is the number of distinct keywords in
S CB ( S B ,respectively), CB i ( B j , respectively) is a key-word in S CB ( S B ,respectively), wcf ( CB i , B j )istheword correlation factor of CB i and B j [4], and # CB i (# B j spectively) denotes the frequency of occurrence of CB i in S
CB ( B j in S B , respectively). # CB i (# B j , respectively) is considered in computing C (
CB , B ), since the larger # CB more significant CB i ( B j , respectively) is in characterizing the content of CB ( B ,respectively). BReK 12 employs wcfs to analyze the content similarity between CB and B ,since they reflect keywords in S CB that are analogous to, but do not exactly match, the keywords in S B .

Item-item Similarity: BReK 12 considers the item-item similarity between B and CB , denoted II Sim ( CB , B in making recommendations. In computing II Sim ( CB , B ),
From now on, unless stated otherwise, (key)words/tags re-fer to non-stop , stemmed (key)words/tags. B ( CB , respectively) is represented as an u -dimensional vec-tor, where u is the number of users who have bookmarked either B or CB at a social bookmarking site such that users who bookmarked B ( CB , respectively) are assigned a  X 1 X  in the corresponding components of the vector. The cosine metric is applied on the vectors of B and CB so that the larger the number of users who have bookmarked both B and CB is, the more likely CB is a relevant recommenda-tion for U [1], as indicated by the metric.

Readability Similarity: BReK 12 recommends books that correlate with the reading level of U (inferred by the readability level of B ). The readability level of a book can be determined using various readability formulas, e.g., SMOG or Fog [3, 5]. Each formula measures a different aspect of a text T , such as the length of each word in T or the popularity of words in T , and yields a different readability score for BReK 12 considers multiple readability formulas in tandem to avoid any bias on using one or the other formula. A combined score, which reflects the similarity in readability levels between B and CB , can be computed by applying the Stanford Certainty Factor on a number of readability scores. gree of similarity between the readability levels of B and CB computed using the i th readability formula f i , f i ( ( f ( CB ), respectively) is the readability score of B ( CB , respectively), and Max , which is a normalization factor, is the largest difference between the readability scores of B each candidate book to be considered for recommendation.
Ranking: BReK 12 computes a ranking score for each candidate book CB with respect to B and recommends to U the top-10 candidate books with the highest Rank scores. Rank ( CB,B )= 1  X  Min { C Sim ( CB,B ) ,II Sim ( CB,B ) ,R Sim ( CB,B ) }
Dataset and evaluation strategy: To evaluate the per-formance of BReK 12, we use a portion of the Bookcrossing dataset (informatik.uni-freiburg.de/  X cziegler/BX). The re-sultant dataset includes 1,173 distinct K-12 users and 8,737 distinct books bookmarked by the users. The description and tag cloud of each book (not provided by the dataset) were extracted from Alibris.com and Librarything.com, re-spectively. The readability levels computed by using the Flesch-Kincaid and Fog readability formulas for each book in the dataset are available on Amazon.com.

Since BReK 12 suggests books for a user based on his/her interest on a particular book, we evaluate the recommen-dations generated by BReK 12 for each of the 14,014 user-book pairs in the resultant dataset. We treat a recommen-dation as relevant for a user-book pair, if the book has been bookmarked by the user on Bookcrossing and non-relevant otherwise, which is a common protocol in evaluating a rec-ommender.
 Empirical Study: To validate the effectiveness of BRe -K 12, we compare its performance with two newly-introduced recommenders, TVS [2] and Cos [6], which were originally developed as document recommenders and were adapted to Table 1: Performance metrics computed for Cos , TVS ,and BReK 12 on 14,014 user-book pairs recommend books for comparison purposes. While TVS represents the content of each book as a TF-IDF tag profile vector, Cos considers the weighted frequency of each key-word in the description or title of the book. TVS and Cos compute the similarity of books using the cosine metric.
As shown in Table 1, BReK 12 outperforms other exist-ing recommenders considered in the empirical study. Based on the computed Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), on the av-erage, BReK 12 users are required to browse through close to one (  X  = 1 0 . 81 = 1.23) recommended book before locating a relevant one, whereas users employing TVS and Cos are required to scan through close to three (  X  = 1 0 . 32 = 3.12) and four (  X  = 1 0 . 26 = 3.84) recommended books, respectively. In addition, the P recision @1 ( P @1) achieved by BReK 12 is significantly higher than the P @1 value achieved by TVS or Cos . The same applies to the P recision @10 ( P @10) values. The high Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain ( nDCG )scoreof BReK 12 indicates that BReK 12 is more effective than Cos and TVS in retrieving relevant books to be recommended and positioning them higher in the list of suggested books.
We have introduced BReK 12, a book recommender tai-lored to K-12 users. Unlike existing recommenders, BReK 12 explicitly considers the reading level of a user U and locates books matching not only a book U is interested in, but most importantly, the reading ability of U . We have empirically verified that BReK 12 outperforms various recommenders in suggesting books suitable for users in K-12 grade levels. [1] T. Bogers and A. van den Bosch. Fusing [2] Z. Guan, C.
