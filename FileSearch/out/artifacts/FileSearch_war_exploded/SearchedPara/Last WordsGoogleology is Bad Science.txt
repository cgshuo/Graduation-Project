 Lexical Computing Ltd. and University of Sussex The World Wide Web is enormous, free, immediately available, and largely linguistic.
As we discover, on ever more fronts, that language analysis and generation benefit from big data, so it becomes appealing to use the Web as a data source. The question, then, is how.
 goal is to find frequencies or probabilities for some phenomenon of interest, we can use the hit count given in the search engine X  X  hits page to make an estimate. People have been doing this for some time now. Early work using hit counts include Grefenstette (1999), who identified likely translations for compositional phrases, and Turney (2001), who found synonyms; perhaps the most cited study is Keller and Lapata (2003), who established the validity of frequencies gathered in this way using experiments with human subjects. Leading recent work includes Nakov and Hearst (2005), who build models of noun compound bracketing.
 proceed beyond the anecdotal, a range of issues must be addressed.
 a simple case: To estimate frequencies for the verb-object pair fulfil obligation , Keller and
Lapata make 36 queries (to cover the whole inflectional paradigm of both verb and noun and to allow for definite and indefinite articles to come between them) to each of
Google and Altavista. It would be desirable to be able to search for fulfil obligation with a single search. If the research question concerns a language with more inflection, or a construction allowing more variability, the issues compound.

(From my reading of the list, these changes seem mainly in the direction of offering less metalanguage.)
Google only allows automated querying via its API, limited to 1,000 queries per user per day. If there are 36 Google queries per single  X  X inguistic X  query, we can make just 27 linguistic queries per day. Other search engines are currently less restrictive but that may arbitrarily change (particularly as corporate mergers are played out), and also

 become experts in the syntax and constraints of Google, Yahoo, Altavista, and so on.
We become  X  X oogleologists X . The argument that the commercial search engines provide low-cost access to the Web fades as we realize how much of our time is devoted to working with and against the constraints that the search engines impose.

 depend on many specifics of the search engine X  X  practice, including how it handles spam and duplicates. (See the entries  X  X ahoo X  X  missing pages X  [2005] and  X  X razy duplicates X  [2006] in Jean V  X  eronis X  X  blog. 1 ) The engines will give you substantially different counts, even for repeats of the same query. In a small experiment, queries repeated the following day gave counts over 10% different 9 times in 30, and by a factor of two different 6 times in 30. The reasons are that queries are sent to different computers, at different points in the update cycle, and with different data in their caches.
 in their hits pages face another issue: The hits are sorted according to a complex and unknown algorithm (with full listings of all results usually not permitted) so we do not know what biases are being introduced. If we wish to investigate the biases, the area we become expert in is googleology, not linguistics.
 An Academic-Community Alternative
An alternative is to work like the search engines, downloading and indexing substantial proportions of the World Wide Web, but to do so transparently, giving reliable figures, and supporting language researchers X  queries. In Baroni and Kilgarriff (2006) we report on a feasibility study: We prepared Web corpora for German ( X  X eWaC X ) and Italian ( X  X tWaC X ) with around 1.5 billion words each, now loaded into a sophisticated corpus query tool and available for research use. 2 (Of course there are various other large Web datasets that research groups have downloaded and are using for NLP.) By sharing good practice and resources and developing expertise, the prospects of the academic research community having resources to compare with Google, Microsoft, and so forth, improves.
 Data Cleaning
The process involves crawling, downloading,  X  X leaning X , and de-duplicating the data, then linguistically annotating it and loading it into a corpus query tool. Expertise and tools are available for most of these steps, with the Internet community providing crawlers and a de-duplication algorithm (Broder et al. 1997) and the NLP community providing corpus query tools, lemmatizers, and POS-taggers for many languages. But in the middle there is a logjam. The questions 148 done, the better the outcomes. All further layers of linguistic processing depend on the cleanliness of the data.
 enough to publish on). Resources have not been pooled, and it has been done cursorily, pages devotes just one paragraph to the corpus development process, and mentions de-duplication and language-filtering but no other cleaning (Ravichandran, Pantel, and
Hovy 2005, Section 4). A paper using that same corpus notes, in a footnote,  X  X s a preprocessing step we hand-edit the clusters to remove those containing non-English words, terms related to adult content, and other Webpage-specific clusters X  (Snow,
Jurafsky, and Ng 2006). The development of open-source tools that identify and filter out each of the many sorts of  X  X irt X  found in Web pages to give clean output will have many beneficiaries, and the CLEANEVAL project 3 has been set up to this end. There will, of course, be differences of opinion about what should be filtered out, and a full toolset will provide a range of options as well as provoke discussion on what we should include and exclude to develop a low-noise, general-language corpus that is suitable for linguistic and language technology research by a wide range of researchers. (In the following, I call the data that meet these criteria  X  X unning text. X ) How Much Non-Duplicate Running Text do the Commercial Search Engines Index, and Can the Academic Community Compare?
Although the anti-googleology arguments may be acknowledged, researchers often shake their heads and say  X  X h, but the commercial search engines index so much data. X  If the goal is to find frequencies of arbitrary  X  noun, preposition, noun  X  triples for PP-attachment disambiguation, then a very, very large dataset is needed to get many non-zero counts. Researchers will continue to use Google, Yahoo, and Altavista unless the NLP community X  X  resources are  X  X oogle-scale X .
The question this forces is,  X  X ow much non-duplicate running text do Google and competitors index? X  for a sample of words in DeWaC and ItWaC with Google frequencies. Thirty words were randomly selected for each language. They were mid-frequency words that were not common words in English, French, German (for Italian), Italian (for German), Portugese, or Spanish, with at least five characters (because longer words are less likely to clash with acronyms or words from other languages). For each of these words, Google was searched with a number of parameters:
Results were not always consistent, with additional filters sometimes producing an increased hit count, so for each word we took the midpoint of the maximum and minimum of the results and compared this number to the DeWaC/ItWaC document frequencies. Here there were two numbers to consider: the count before filtering and cleaning, and the count after. A sample of the results is shown in Table 1.
 than browser queries: A substantial number were one-eighteenth as large. Altavista, which has a reputation for NLP-friendliness, was also explored, but because Altavista X  X  index is known to be smaller than Google X  X , and the goal was to compare it with the biggest index available, Altavista results were not going to answer the critical question. indexed running text for German and Italian. The Google counts are best compared with
DeWaC/ItWaC  X  X aw X  counts, and a first scaling factor will give an indication of the size of the Google-indexed German/Italian World Wide Web inclusive of non-running-text and duplicates. Taking the midpoint between maximum and minimum and averaging across words, the ratio for German is 83.5:1 and for Italian, 33:1. A further scaling factor should then be applied, based on the raw:clean ratio, to assess how much of the material is duplicated or not running text. However, we do not know to what extent Google applies de-duplication and other rubbish-filtering strategies before calculating counts, and DeWaC/ItWaC filtering and cleaning errs towards rejecting doubtful material. The mean ratio raw:clean is 5.3 for German, 4.5 for Italian: For a best estimate, we halve the figures. Best estimates for the Google-indexed, non-duplicative running text are then 45 billion words for German and 25 billion words for Italian, as summarized in Table 2.

The point here is that a pilot project (of half a person-year X  X  effort) was able to pro-vide a corpus that was several percent of Google-scale, for two languages. It provides grounds for optimism that the Web can be used, without reliance on commercial search engines and, at least for languages other than English, without sacrificing too much in terms of scale.
 In Sum
The most talked-about presentation of ACL 2005 was Franz-Josef Och X  X , in which he presented statistical MT results based on a 250 billion-word English corpus. His results 150 led the field. He was in a privileged position to have access to a corpus of that size. He works at Google.
 the academic NLP community. The first is to accept defeat:  X  X e will never have re-sources on the scale of Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo, so we should accept that our systems will not really compete, that they will be proofs-of-concept or deal with niche problems, but will be out of the mainstream of high-performance language technology system development. X  The second is to say: We too need to make resources on this scale available, and they should be available to researchers in universities as well as behind corporate firewalls, and we can do it, because resources of the right scale are available, for free, on the World Wide Web, and between us we have the skills and the talent.
