 Over the past decade, crowd-sourcing platforms have entered mainstream usage and rapidly become valuable organizational resources, offering rich heteroge-neous and relational data. However, to properly exploit the user-generated data and to produce comprehensive analysis, associated digital business must face sev-eral issues of quality and consistency. Even by clamping down signups, meta-data associated to users generated contents can be doubtfull or incomplete, justifying the needs of quality and consistency assessment tools.
 ital libraries is addressed. An heterogeneous graph is used to represent the plat-form and the relations between the different entities and a classification problem is formulated to predict the authors of unlabelled nodes. The homophily patterns lying between the interests of the users and their friends are first empirically demonstrated. Based on this observation suggesting that close friends tend to have similar favorite readings, an affinity-based regularization term in integrated in a dedicated objective function in order to smooth latent representations of the users. The paper is organized as follow. Section 2 introduces previous research closely related to our problem. Section 3 motivates the general ideal of our work. Section 4 describes the proposal. Finally Sects. 5 and 6 provide experimental setup, evaluations and conclusions. many types of correlations between the structural properties of a graph and the associated users properties. Cook et al. [ 5 ] show that people X  X  affinity net-works are highly correlated with several behavioral and sociodemographic char-acteristics, exploring geography, family ties, education, social class and others. In [ 8 ], the social structure of the Facebook affinity network of several American institutions in studied. The authors has examined the homophily patterns using assortativity coefficients based on observed ties between nodes, considering both microscopic and macroscopic properties. They show different realizations of net-works and, for example, observe that women are more likely to have friends within their common residence while this characteristic for male-only networks exhibit a larger variation. Backstrom et al. [ 1 ] have studied the ways in which communities grow over time, and more importantly, how different groups come together or attract new members. By taking the case of the LiveJournal plat-form, they have shown how the affinity graph structure of a member impacts his propensity to join new communities. Similar results have been suggested over the collaboration networks of scientists. For example, in [ 3 ], authors suggest that two researchers are more likely to collaborate if both have already collaborated with a third common scientist. As in [ 4 , 10 ], we suppose that two nodes connected in a network will tend to have similar latent representations. Thus, we propose to capture homophily patterns using an affinity-based regularization term. In this section, we make use of the affinity graph of the members of the Babelio platform to demonstrate that linked users tend to have similar favorite books. Let consider the affinity relation V such that ( i, j )  X  j are friends on the platform. Let f k i be a characteristics vector such that f is the number of books written by author j for which user i has given k stars (from 1 to 5). From the averaged distance function S k formalized in Eq. ( 1 ), we define the inter-relation and extra-relation distances metric as follow: For a neighborhood N i = { j :( i, j )  X  V } , i.e., the friends of the user associated to node i ,the inter-relation metric captures the averaged distance between all nodes and their neighboors. For N i = { j :( i, j ) /  X  V friends with node i , we define the extra-relation metric. In practice, the latter is defined over a random subset of N i such that the neighbooroods X  size of both metrics are equal. Figure 1 (a) reports the normalized evolution of both distances metrics in function of k over the four graphs used for the experimentations and described in Sect. 5 .
 than the extra-relation one. In other words, connected nodes are more likely to read books of similar authors than non connected ones. This first observation constitutes the core of our proposal and justifies the regularization term proposed in Sect. 2 that constraints users to have similar latent representations. Secondly, from Fig. 1 (b), which shows the main component of the affinity graph G the experiments, we observe two distinct patterns. A color is associated to each author, and nodes are colored according to their favorite ones. Areas of uniform colors clearly reflect homophily patterns showing that users tend to naturally create communities sharing similar reading. Notations. Let U = { u i } 1  X  i  X  n be the set of users, of books and A = { a l } 1  X  l  X  p the set of authors, with { ( u i ,b j ,v ij ) } i  X  n,j  X  m , be a bi-partite graph associating the interest v user u i  X  X  to book b j  X  X  . In addition, let G friends =( U with U friends = U be an affinity graph: users u i and u j V friends .Let  X  i  X  R k ,  X  j  X  R k and  X  l  X  R k be the latent representations of the users, books and authors respectively, with k being the dimension of the com-mon latent space. Finally, let y j  X  R p be the labels vector associated to book b . In particular, y j,l =1if a l is the author of book b j to reconstruct the labels vectors y j for each unlabelled book.
 Formulation. Predicting books X  author is viewed as a classification task where the variable y j,l  X  X  X  1 , +1 } has to be explained. In this work, we assume a set of linear classifiers per books, where the prediction  X  y is given by the linear model f l ( b j )=  X  l ;  X  j . Given a particular loss function  X  :
R 2  X  R , we propose to optimize the following objective: The first term computes the classification error related to the authors X  predic-tions associated to each book. A Hinge loss function  X  ( y y f ( b j )), which is suitable for classification problems, was used in our exper-iments. The last two terms are aimed to smooth and propagate the decision variables through the different relations and capture the proposed intuition. The regularization d is done using the L 2 norm. Therefore, close friends and related favorite books tend to have similar representations in R k the affinity regularization term . Finding the representations of the users, books and authors such that L is minimized is equivalent to solve: Since the Hinge loss is a convex function, standard approaches based on gradient descent can be used. In particular, we have: In practice, we solved Eq. ( 3 )using L-BFGS [ 7 ], a quasi-Newton method for non-linear optimizations. The parameters  X  ,  X  ,  X  exhibit kn , km and kp decision variables respectively. Thus, our model parameters  X  =(  X  Dataset. For the experiments, several subsets of the Babelio used. Founded in 2007, Babelio is an emerging French crowd-sourcing portal for book lovers, where internauts can share their favorite readings. Members can critic books by leaving textual comments and assigning from 1 to 5 stars. These engagement signals are made public by the platform, allowing members to network each others using a friendship functionality. Table 1 summarized the four graphs used for the experiments.
 Evaluation Metric. For every b o ok j ,let  X  j be the permutation over the authors induced by the predicted scores  X  y j . The ranking induced by  X  ated using the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain [ 9 ], computed as follow: where  X  j,  X  is the optimal ranking for book j , consisting in placing the real authors of a book in first positions. Thus, we capture how far the prediction is from the optimal rank. The average of the NDCG values over all the books is reported. Protocol. For each graph, two optimizations, with identical initial values, are performed:  X  Prefs. + Aff. The proposed objective as formalized in Equation ( 2 ).  X  Prefs. only. The proposed objective without considering the affinity regular-ization term .
 Since the initialization may affect the solution, only the best runs according to the introduced evaluation metric are reported. For each run, the dataset is randomly splitted into a train and a test datasets as follow: for each author, x % of his books are used for training, and the rest for testing. Results over the test dataset are reported.
 Results. Several values of k have been tested and only the best runs are reported. Results are summarized in Table 2 . Proposed solution globally improves the baseline in generalization by roughly 3 %, confirming our intuition and the interest of smoothing the users representations. We address the problem of assessing the authors of unlabelled books in digital libraries. To this end, the homophily patterns lying between the interests of the users and their friends are empirically demonstrated and incorporated as a regu-larization term in a dedicated objective function. By postulating that friends are more likely to share favorite readings, we force connected node to have similar representations. Experiments demonstrate significant quality improvement com-pared to the baseline that does not consider inter-users relationship. As future work, we will pursue our study by integrating the numerical votes in the system and new members caracteristics.
