 The detection and resolution of discourse refer-ences such as coreference and bridging anaphora play an important role in text understanding appli-cations, like question answering and information extraction. There, reference resolution is used for the purpose of combining knowledge from multi-ple sentences. Such knowledge is also important for Textual Entailment (TE), a generic framework for modeling semantic inference. TE reduces the inference requirements of many text understand-ing applications to the problem of determining whether the meaning of a given textual assertion, termed hypothesis ( H ), can be inferred from the meaning of certain text ( T ) (Dagan et al., 2006).
Consider the following example: (1) T:  X  Not only had he developed an aversion The understanding that the second sentence of the text entails the hypothesis draws on two corefer-ence relationships, namely that he is Oswald , and that the Kennedy in question is President Kennedy . However, the utilization of discourse information for such inferences has been so far limited mainly to the substitution of nominal coreferents, while many aspects of the interface between discourse and semantic inference needs remain unexplored. The recently held Fifth Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE-5) challenge (Bentivogli et al., 2009a) has introduced a Search task, where the text sentences are interpreted in the context of their full discourse, as in Example 1 above. Accord-ingly, TE constitutes an interesting framework  X  and the Search task an adequate dataset  X  to study the interrelation between discourse and inference.
The goal of this study is to analyze the roles of discourse references for textual entailment in-ference, to provide relevant findings and insights to developers of both reference resolvers and en-tailment systems and to highlight promising direc-tions for the better incorporation of discourse phe-nomena into inference. Our focus is on a manual, in-depth assessment that results in a classification and quantification of discourse reference phenom-ena and their utilization for inference. On this ba-sis, we develop an account of formal devices for incorporating discourse references into the infer-ence computation. An additional point of inter-est is the interrelation between entailment knowl-edge and coreference. E.g., in Example 1 above, knowing that Kennedy was a president can alle-viate the need for coreference resolution. Con-versely, coreference resolution can often be used to overcome gaps in entailment knowledge.
 Structure of the paper. In Section 2, we pro-vide background on the use of discourse refer-ences in natural language processing (NLP) in general and specifically in TE. Section 3 describes the goals of this study, followed by our analy-sis scheme (Section 4) and the required inference mechanisms (Section 5). Section 6 presents quan-titative findings and further observations. Conclu-sions are discussed in Section 7. 2.1 Discourse in NLP Discourse information plays a role in a range of NLP tasks. It is obviously central to dis-course processing tasks such as text segmenta-tion (Hearst, 1997). Reference information pro-vided by discourse is also useful for text under-standing tasks such as question answering (QA), information extraction (IE) and information re-trieval (IR) (Vicedo and Ferrndez, 2006; Zelenko et al., 2004; Na and Ng, 2009), as well as for the acquisition of lexical-semantic  X  X arrative schema X  knowledge (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009). Dis-course references have been the subject of atten-tion in both the Message Understanding Confer-ence (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996) and the Au-tomatic Content Extraction program (Strassel et al., 2008).

The simplest form of information that discourse provides is coreference , i.e., information that two linguistic expressions refer to the same entity or event. Coreference is particularly important for processing pronouns and other anaphoric expres-sions, such as he in Example 1. Ability to re-solve this reference translates directly into, e.g., a QA system X  X  ability to answer questions like Who killed Kennedy? .

A second, more complex type of information stems from bridging references , such as in the fol-lowing discourse (Asher and Lascarides, 1998): (2)  X  I X  X e just arrived . The camel is outside.  X  While coreference indicates equivalence, bridging points to the existence of a salient semantic rela-tion between two distinct entities or events. Here, it is (informally)  X  X eans of transport X  , which would make the discourse (2) relevant for a ques-tion like How did I arrive here? . Other types of bridging relations include set-membership, roles in events and consequence (Clark, 1975).

Note, however, that text understanding systems are generally limited to the resolution of entity (or even just pronoun) coreference, e.g. (Li et al., 2009; Dali et al., 2009). An important reason is the unavailability of tools to resolve the more complex (and difficult) forms of discourse reference such as event coreference and bridging. 1 Another reason is uncertainty about their practical importance. 2.2 Discourse in Textual Entailment Textual Entailment has been introduced in Sec-tion 1 as a common-sense notion of inference. It has spawned interest in the computational lin-guistics community as a common denominator of many NLP tasks including IE, summarization and tutoring (Romano et al., 2006; Harabagiu et al., 2007; Nielsen et al., 2009).
 Architectures for Textual Entailment. Over the course of recent RTE challenges (Giampic-colo et al., 2007; Giampiccolo et al., 2008), the main benchmark for TE technology, two archi-tectures for modeling TE have emerged as dom-inant: transformations and alignment . The goal of transformation -based TE models is to deter-mine the entailment relation T  X  H by find-ing a  X  X roof X , i.e., a sequence of consequents, ( T, T 1 , . . . , T n ) , such that T n = H (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Harmeling, 2009), and that in each trans-formation, T i  X  T i +1 , the consequent T i +1 is en-tailed by T i . These transformations commonly in-clude lexical modifications and the generation of syntactic alternatives. The second major approach constructs an alignment between the linguistic en-tities of the trees (or graphs) of T and H , which can represent syntactic structure, semantic struc-ture, or non-hierarchical phrases (Zanzotto et al., 2009; Burchardt et al., 2009; MacCartney et al., 2008). H is assumed to be entailed by T if its en-tities are aligned  X  X ell X  to corresponding entities in T . Alignment quality is generally determined based on features that assess the validity of the lo-cal replacement of the T entity by the H entity.
While transformation-and alignment-based en-tailment models look different at first glance, they ultimately have the same goal, namely obtaining a maximal coverage of H by T , i.e. to identify matches of as many elements of H within T as possible. 2 To do so, both architectures typically make use of inference rules such as  X  Y was pur-chased by X  X  X paid for Y  X , either by directly ap-plying them as transformations, or by using them to score alignments. Rules are generally drawn from external knowledge resources, such as Word-Net (Fellbaum, 1998) or DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001), although knowledge gaps remain a key ob-stacle (Bos, 2005; Balahur et al., 2008; Bar-Haim et al., 2008).
 Discourse in previous RTE challenges. The first two rounds of the RTE challenge used  X  X elf-contained X  texts and hypotheses, where discourse considerations played virtually no role. A first step towards a more comprehensive notion of entail-ment was taken with RTE-3 (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), when paragraph-length texts were first in-cluded and constituted 17% of the texts in the test set. Chambers et al. (2007) report that in a sample of T  X  H pairs drawn from the development set, 25% involved discourse references.

Using the concepts introduced above, the im-pact of discourse references can be generally de-scribed as a coverage problem , independent of the system X  X  architecture. In Example 1, the hypoth-esis word Oswald cannot be safely linked to the text pronoun he without further knowledge about he ; the same is true for  X  Kennedy  X  President Kennedy  X  which involves a specialization that is only warranted in the specific discourse.

A number of systems have tried to address the question of coreference in RTE as a preprocessing step prior to inference proper, with most systems using off-the-shelf coreference resolvers such as JavaRap (Qiu et al., 2004) or OpenNLP 3 . Gen-erally, anaphoric expressions were textually re-placed by their antecedents. Results were in-conclusive, however, with several reports about errors introduced by automatic coreference res-olution (Agichtein et al., 2008; Adams et al., 2007). Specific evaluations of the contribution of coreference resolution yielded both small nega-tive (Bar-Haim et al., 2008) and insignificant pos-itive (Chambers et al., 2007) results. The results of recent studies, as reported in Sec-tion 2.2, seem to show that current resolution of discourse references in RTE systems hardly af-fects performance. However, our intuition is that these results can be attributed to four major lim-itations shared by these studies: (1) the datasets, where discourse phenomena were not well repre-sented; (2) the off-the-shelf coreference resolution systems which may have been not robust enough; (3) the limitation to nominal coreference; and (4) overly simple integration of reference information into the inference engines.

The goal of this paper is to assess the impact of discourse references on entailment with an anno-tation study which removes these limitations. To counteract (1), we use the recent RTE-5 Search dataset (details below). To avoid (2), we perform a manual analysis, assuming discourse references as predicted by an oracle. With regards to (3), our annotation scheme covers coreference and bridg-ing relations of all syntactic categories and classi-fies them. As for (4), we suggest several opera-tions necessary to integrate the discourse informa-tion into an entailment engine.

In contrast to the numerous existing datasets annotated for discourse references (Hovy et al., 2006; Strassel et al., 2008), we do not annotate ex-haustively. Rather, we are interested specifically in those references instances that impact inference. Furthermore, we analyze each instance from an entailment perspective, characterizing the relevant factors that have an impact on inference. To our knowledge, this is the first such in-depth study. 4 The results of our study are of twofold interest. First, they provide guidance for the developers of reference resolvers who might prioritize the scope of their systems to make them more valuable for inference. Second, they point out potential direc-tions for the developers of inference systems by specifying what additional inference mechanisms are needed to utilize discourse information. The RTE-5 Search dataset. We base our anno-tation on the Search task dataset, a new addition to the recent Fifth RTE challenge (Bentivogli et al., 2009a) that is motivated by the needs of NLP applications and drawn from the TAC summariza-tion track. In the Search task, TE systems are re-quired to find all individual sentences in a given corpus which entail the hypothesis  X  a setting that is sensible not only for summarization, but also for information access tasks like QA. Sentences are judged individually, but  X  X re to be interpreted in the context of the corpus as they rely on explicit and implicit references to entities, events, dates, places, etc., mentioned elsewhere in the corpus X  (Bentivogli et al., 2009b). depends on reference information from the discourse sentences T terms (in H ) are shown in boldface. For annotating the RTE-5 data, we operationalize reference relations that are relevant for entailment as those that improve coverage . Recall from Sec-tion 2.2 that the concept of coverage is applicable to both transformation and alignment models, all of which aim at maximizing coverage of H by T .
We represent T and H as syntactic trees, as common in the RTE literature (Zanzotto et al., 2009; Agichtein et al., 2008). Specifically, we assume MINIPAR-style (Lin, 1993) dependency trees where nodes represent text expressions and edges represent the syntactic relations between them. We use  X  X erm X  to refer to text expressions, and  X  X omponents X  to refer to nodes, edges, and subtrees. Dependency trees are a popular choice in RTE since they offer a fairly semantics-oriented account of the sentence structure that can still be constructed robustly. In an ideal case of entail-ment, all nodes and dependency edges of H are covered by T .

For each T  X  H pair, we annotate all relevant discourse references in terms of three items: the target component in H , the focus term in T , and the reference term which stands in a reference re-lation to the focus term. By resolving this ref-erence, the target component can usually be in-ferred; sometimes, however, more than one ref-erence term needs to be found. We now define and illustrate these concepts on examples from Table 1. 5 The target component is a tree component in H that cannot be covered by the  X  X ocal X  material from T . An example for a tree component is Ex-ample (v), where the target component AS-28 mini submarine in H cannot be inferred from the pro-noun it in T . Example (vi) demonstrates an edge as target component. In this case, the edge in H connecting melt with the modifier in the Arctic is not found in T . Although each of the hypothesis X  nodes can be covered separately via knowledge-based rules (e.g.  X  Siberia  X  Arctic  X ,  X  permafrost  X  ice  X ,  X  thaw  X  melt  X ), the resulting fragments in T are unconnected without the (intra-sentential) coreference between them and lakes in Siberia .
For each target component, we identify its focus term as the expression in T that does not cover the target component itself but participates in a refer-ence relation that can help covering it.

We follow the focus term X  X  reference chain to a reference term which can, either separately or in combination with the focus term, help covering the target component. In Example (ii), where the target component in H is 2003 UB313 , Xena is the focus term in T and the reference term is a men-tion of 2003 UB313 in a previous sentence, T 0 . In this case, the reference term covers the entire tar-get component on its own.

An additional attribute that we record for each instance is whether resolving the discourse refer-ence is mandatory for determining entailment, or optional . In Example (v), it is mandatory: the in-ference cannot be completed without the knowl-edge provided by the discourse. In contrast, in Example (ii), inferring 2003 UB313 from Xena is optional. It can be done either by identify-ing their coreference relation, or by using back-ground knowledge in the form of an entailment rule,  X  Xena  X  2003 UB313  X , that is applicable in the context of astronomy. Optional discourse references represent instances where discourse in-formation and TE knowledge are interchange-able. As mentioned, knowledge gaps constitute a major obstacle for TE systems, and we can-not rely on the availability of any ceratin piece of knowledge to the inference process. Thus, in our scheme, mandatory references provide a  X  X ower bound X  with regards to the necessity to resolve discourse references, even in the presence of com-plete knowledge ; optional references, on the other hand, set an  X  X pper bound X  for the contribution of discourse resolution to inference, when no knowl-edge is available. At the same time, this scheme allows investigating how much TE knowledge can be replaced by (perfect) discourse processing.
When choosing a reference term, we search the reference chain of the focus term for the nearest expression that is identical to the target component or a subcomponent of it. If we find such an expres-sion, covering the identical part of the target com-ponent requires no entailment knowledge. If no identical reference term exists, we choose the se-mantically  X  X losest X  term from the reference chain, i.e. the term which requires the least knowledge to infer the target component. For instance, we may pick permafrost as the semantically closet term to the target ice if the latter is not found in the focus term X  X  reference chain.

Finally, for each reference relation that we an-notate, we record four additional attributes which we assumed to be informative in an evaluation. First, the reference type : Is the relation a coref-erence or a bridging reference? Second, the syn-tactic type of the focus and reference terms. Third, the focus/reference terms entailment status  X  does some kind of entailment relation hold between the two terms? Fourth, the operation that should be performed on the focus and reference terms to ob-tain coverage of the target component (as specified in Section 5). In initial analysis we found that the standard sub-stitution operation applied by virtually all previous studies for integrating coreference into entailment is insufficient. We identified three distinct cases for the integration of discourse reference knowl-edge in entailment, which correspond to different relations between the target component, the fo-cus term and the reference term. This section de-scribes the three cases and characterizes them in terms of tree transformations. An initial version of these transformations is described in (Abad et al., 2010). We assume a transformation-based entail-ment architecture (cf. Section 2.2), although we believe that the key points of our account are also applicable to alignment-based architecture. Trans-formations create revised trees that cover previ-ously uncovered target components in H . The output of each transformation, T 1 , is comprised of copies of the components used to construct it, and is appended to the discourse forest, which in-cludes the dependency trees of all sentences and their generated consequents.

We assume that we have access to a dependency tree for H , a dependency forest for T and its dis-course context, as well as the output of a perfect discourse processor, i.e., a complete set of both coreference and bridging relations, including the type of bridging relation (e.g. part-of , cause ).
We use the following notation. We use x, y for tree nodes, and S x to denote a (sub-)tree with root x . lab ( x ) is the label of the incoming edge of x (i.e., its grammatical function). We write C ( x, y ) for a coreference relation between S x and S , the corresponding trees of the focus and refer-ence terms, respectively. We write B r ( x, y ) for a bridging relation, where r is its type. (1) Substitution: This is the most intuitive and widely-used transformation, corresponding to the treatment of discourse information in existing sys-tems. It applies to coreference relations, when an expression found elsewhere in the text (the refer-ence term) can cover all missing information (the Figure 1: The Substitution transformation, demon-strated on the relevant subtrees of Example (i). The dashed line denotes a discourse reference. target component) on its own. In such cases, the reference term can replace the entire focus term. Apparently (cf. Section 6), substitution applies also to some types of bridging relations, such as set-membership , when the member is sufficient for representing the entire set for the necessary infer-ence. For example, in  X  I met two people yesterday. The woman told me a story.  X  (Clark, 1975), sub-stituting two people with woman results in a text which is entailed from the discourse, and which allows inferring  X  I met a woman yesterday.  X 
In a parse tree representation, given a corefer-ence relation C ( x, y ) (or B r ( x, y ) ), the newly gen-erated tree, T 1 , consists of a copy of T , where the entire tree S x is replaced by a copy of S y . In Fig-ure 1, which shows Example (i) from Table 1, such unions is substituted by homosexual marriages .
Head-substitution. Occasionally, substituting only the head of the focus term is sufficient. In such cases, only the root nodes x and y are sub-stituted. This is the case, for example, with syn-onymous verbs with identical subcategorization frames (like melt and thaw ). As verbs typically constitute tree roots in dependency parses, sub-stituting or merging (see below) their entire trees might be inappropriate or wasteful. In such cases, the simpler head-substitution may be applied. (2) Merge: In contrast to substitution, where a match for the entire target component is found elsewhere in the text, this transformation is re-quired when parts of the missing information are scattered among multiple locations in the text. We distinguish between two types of merge trans-formations: (a) dependent-merge , and (b) head-merge , depending on the syntactic roles of the merged components. (a) Dependent-Merge. This operation is ap-plicable when the head of either the focus or ref-erence terms (of both) matches the head node of Figure 2: The dependent-merge ( T 0 a ) and head-merge ( T 0 b ) transformations (Example (iii)). the target component, but modifiers from both of them are required to cover the target component X  X  dependents. The modifiers are therefore merged as dependents of a single head node, to create a tree that covers the entire target component. Dependent-merge is illustrated in Figure 2, using Example (iii). The component we wish to cover in H is the noun phrase AS-28 mini submarine . Un-fortunately, the focus term in T ,  X  mini submarine trapped on the seabed  X , covers only the modifier mini , but not AS-28 . This modifier can however be provided by the coreferent term in T 0 a (left upper corner). Once merged, the inference engine can, e.g., employ the rule  X  on seabed  X  underwater  X  to cover H completely.

Formally, assume without loss of generality that y , the reference term X  X  head, matches the root node of the target component. Given C ( x, y ) , we define T 1 as a copy of T , where (i) the subtree S x is re-placed by S y , and (ii) for all children c of x , a copy of S c is placed under the copy of y in T 1 with its original edge label, lab ( c ) . (b) Head-merge. An alternative way to recover the missing information in Example (iii) is to find a reference term whose head word itself (rather than one of its modifiers) matches the target com-ponent X  X  missing dependent, as with AS-28 in Fig-ure 2 in the bottom left corner ( T 0 b ). In terms of parse trees, we need to add one tree as a depen-dent of the other. Formally, given C ( x, y ) , simi-larly to dependent-merge, T 1 is created as a copy of T where the subtree S x is replaced by either S x or S y , depending on whichever of x and y matches the target component X  X  head. Assume it is x , for example. Then, a copy of S y is added as a new child to x . In our sample, head-merge operations correspond to internal coreferences within nomi-nal target components (such as between AS-28 and mini submarine in this case). The appropriate la-bel, lab ( y ) , in these cases is nn (nominal modi-Figure 3: The insertion transformation. Dotted edges mark the newly inserted path (Ex. (iv)). fier). Further analysis is required to specify what other dependencies can hold between such core-ferring heads. (3) Insertion: The last transformation, insertion, is used when a relation that is realized in H is missing from T and is only implied via a bridg-ing relation. In Example (iv), the location that is explicitly mentioned in H can only be covered by T by resolving a bridging reference with China in T 0 . To connect the bridging referents, a new tree component representing the bridging relation is inserted into the consequent tree T 1 . In this ex-ample, the component connects China and recent accident via the in preposition. Formally, given a bridging relation B r ( x, y ) , we introduce a new subtree S r z into T 1 , where z is a child of x and lab ( z ) = lab r . S r z must contain a variable node that is instantiated with a copy of S ( y ) .
This transformation stands out from the others in that it introduces new material. For each bridg-ing relation, it adds a specific subtrees S r via an edge labeled with lab r . These two items form the dependency representation of the bridging relation B r and must be provided by the interface between the discourse and the inference systems. Clearly, their exact form depends on the set of bridging re-lations provided by the discourse resolver as well as the details of the dependency parses.

As shown in Figure 3, the bridging relation located-in ( r ) is represented by inserting a subtree S z headed by in ( z ) into T 1 and connecting it to accident ( x ) as a mod ifier ( lab r ). The subtree S r consists of a variable node which is connected to in with a pcomp-n dependency (a nominal head of a prepositional phrase), and which is instantiated with the node China ( y ) when the transformation is applied. Note that the structure of S r z and the way it is inserted into T 1 are predefined by the abovementioned interface; only the node to which it is attached and the contents of the variable node are determined at transformation-time.

As another example, consider the following short text from (Clark, 1975): John was murdered yesterday. The knife lay nearby . Here, the bridg-ing relation between the murder event and the in-strument, the knife ( x ), can be addressed by in-serting under x a subtree for the clause with which as S r z , with a variable which is instantiated by the parse-tree (headed by murdered , y ) of the entire first sentence John was murdered yesterday . Transformation chaining. Since our transfor-mations are defined to be minimal, some cases re-quire the application of multiple transformations to achieve coverage. Consider Example (v), Ta-ble 1. We wish to cover AS-28 mini submarine in H from the coreferring it in T , mini submarine in T 0 and AS-28 vehicle in T 00 . A substitution of it by either coreference does not suffice, since none of the antecedents contains all necessary modifiers. It is therefore necessary to substitute it first by one of the coreferences and then merge it with the other. We analyzed 120 sentence-hypothesis pairs of the RTE-5 development set (21 different hypotheses, 111 distinct sentences, 53 different documents). Below, we summarize our findings, focusing on the relation between our findings and the assump-tions of previous studies as discussed in Section 3. General statistics. We found that 44% of the pairs contained reference relations whose resolu-tion was mandatory for inference. In another 28%, references could optionally support the inference of the hypothesis. In the remaining 28%, refer-ences did not contribute towards inference. The total number of relevant references was 137, and 37 pairs (27%) contained multiple relevant refer-ences. These numbers support our assumption that discourse references play an important role in in-ference.
 Reference types. 73% of the identified refer-ences are coreferences and 27% are bridging re-lations. The most common bridging relation was the location of events (e.g. Arctic in ice melting events), generally assumed to be known through-out the document. Other bridging relations we en-countered include cause (e.g. between injured and attack ), event participants and set membership.
Table 2: Syntactic types of discourse references Table 3: Distribution of transformation types Syntactic types. Table 2 shows that 77% of all focus terms and 86% of the reference terms were nominal phrases, which justifies their prominent position in work on anaphora and coreference res-olution. However, almost a quarter of the focus terms were verbal phrases. We found these focus terms to be frequently crucial for entailment since they included the main predicate of the hypothe-sis. 6 This calls for an increased focus on the reso-lution of event references.
 Transformations. Table 3 shows the relative frequencies of all transformations. Again, we found that the  X  X efault X  transformation, substitu-tion, is the most frequent one, and is helpful for both coreference and bridging relations. Substitu-tion is particularly useful for handling pronouns (14% of all substitution instances), the replace-ment of named entities by synonymous names (32%), the replacement of other NPs (38%), and the substitution of verbal head nodes in event coreference (16%). Yet, in nearly half the cases, a different transformation had to be applied. In-sertion accounts for the majority of bridging cases. Head-merge is necessary to integrate proper nouns as modifiers of other head nouns. Dependent-merge, responsible for 85% of the merge transfor-mations, can be used to complete nominal focus terms with missing modifiers (e.g., adjectives), as well as for merging other dependencies between coreferring predicates. This result indicates the importance of incorporating other transformations into inference systems.
 Distance of reference terms. The distance be-tween the focus and the reference terms varied considerably, ranging from intra-sentential refer-ence relations and up to several dozen sentences. For more than a quarter of the focus terms, we had to go to other documents to find reference terms that, possibly in conjunction with the focus term, could cover the target components. Interest-ingly, all such cases involved coreference (about equally divided between the merge transforma-tions and substitutions), while bridging was al-ways  X  X ocument-local X . This result reaffirms the usefulness of cross-document coreference resolu-tion for inference (Huang et al., 2009).
 Discourse resolution as preprocessing? In ex-isting RTE systems, discourse references are typ-ically resolved as a preprocessing step. While our annotation was manual and cannot yield di-rect results about processing considerations, we observed that discourse relations often hold be-tween complex, and deeply embedded, expres-sions, which makes their automatic resolution dif-ficult. Of course, many RTE systems attempt to normalize and simplify H and T , e.g., by split-ting conjunctions or removing irrelevant clauses, but these operations are usually considered a part of the inference rather the preprocessing phase (cf. e.g., Bar-Haim et al. (2007)). Since the resolu-tion of discourse references is likely to profit from these steps, it seems desirable to  X  X ostpone X  it un-til after simplification. In transformation-based systems, it might be natural to add discourse-based transformations to the set of inference operations, while in alignment-based systems, discourse ref-erences can be integrated into the computation of alignment scores.
 Discourse references vs. entailment knowledge. We have stated before that even if a discourse ref-erence is not strictly necessary for entailment, it may be interesting because it represents an alter-native to the use of knowledge rules to cover the hypothesis. Sometimes, these rules are generally applicable (e.g.,  X  Alaska  X  Arctic  X ). However, of-ten they are context-specific. Consider the follow-ing sentence as T for the hypothesis H :  X  The ice is melting in the Arctic  X : (3) T :  X  The scene at the receding edge of the Exit While it is possible to cover melting using a rule  X  melting  X  receding  X , this rule is only valid under quite specific conditions (e.g., for the subject ice ). Instead of determining the applicability of the rule, a discourse-aware system can take the next sen-tence into account, which contains a coreferring event to receding that can cover melting in H : (4) T 0 :  X  . . . people moved closer to the rope line Discourse relations can in fact encode arbitrar-ily complex world knowledge, as in the following pair: (5) H:  X  The serial killer BTK was accused of at Here, the H modifier serial , which does not occur in T , can be covered either by world knowledge (a person who killed 10 people is a serial killer), or by resolving the coreference of BTK to the term the serial killer BTK which occurs in the discourse around T . Our conclusion is that not only can discourse references often replace world knowl-edge in principle, in practice it often seems easier to resolve discourse references than to determine whether a rule is applicable in a given context or to formalize complex world knowledge as infer-ence rules. Our annotation provides further em-pirical support to this claim: An entailment rela-tion exists between the focus and reference terms in 60% of the focus-reference term pairs, and in many of the remainder, entailment holds between the terms X  heads. Thus, discourse provides rela-tions which are many times equivalent to entail-ment knowledge rules and can therefore be uti-lized in their stead. This work has presented an analysis of the relation between discourse references and textual entail-ment. We have identified a set of limitations com-mon to the handling of discourse relations in vir-tually all entailment systems. They include the use of off-the-shelf resolvers that concentrate on nom-inal coreference, the integration of reference in-formation through substitution, and the RTE eval-uation schemes, which played down the role of discourse. Since in practical settings, discourse plays an important role, our goal was to develop an agenda for improving the handling of discourse references in entailment-based inference.

Our manual analysis of the RTE-5 dataset shows that while the majority of discourse refer-ences that affect inference are nominal coreference relations, another substantial part is made up by verbal terms and bridging relations. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that substitution alone is in-sufficient to extract all relevant information from the wide range of discourse references that are frequently relevant for inference. We identified three general cases, and suggested matching op-erations to obtain the relevant inferences, formu-lated as tree transformations. Furthermore, our ev-idence suggests that for practical reasons, the res-olution of discourse references should be tightly integrated into entailment systems instead of treat-ing it as a preprocessing step.

A particularly interesting result concerns the interplay between discourse references and en-tailment knowledge. While semantic knowledge (e.g., from WordNet or Wikipedia) has been used beneficially for coreference resolution (Soon et al., 2001; Ponzetto and Strube, 2006), reference res-olution has, to our knowledge, not yet been em-ployed to validate entailment rules X  applicability. Our analyses suggest that in the context of de-ciding textual entailment, reference resolution and entailment knowledge can be seen as complemen-tary ways of achieving the same goal, namely en-riching T with additional knowledge to allow the inference of H . Given that both of the technolo-gies are still imperfect, we envisage the way for-ward as a joint strategy, where reference resolution and entailment rules mutually fill each other X  X  gaps (cf. Example 3).

In sum, our study shows that textual entailment can profit substantially from better discourse han-dling. The next challenge is to translate the the-oretical gain into practical benefit. Our analy-sis demonstrates that improvements are necessary both on the side of discourse reference resolution systems, which need to cover more types of refer-ences, as well as a better integration of discourse information in entailment systems, even for those relations which are within the scope of available resolvers.
