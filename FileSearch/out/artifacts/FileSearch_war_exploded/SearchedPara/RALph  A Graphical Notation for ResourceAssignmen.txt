 The Business Process (BP) resource perspective deals with the management of management of resources in this context involves the definition of assignments missing.
 approaches can be roughly categorised as follows. On the one hand, languages like Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) [ 3 ] emphasise modelling of but non-visual attributes. On the other hand, implementations like the YAWL the visual notation. A few works have contributed towards a better integration recently [ 5 , 6 ]. Still, they expose gaps towards a full visual support. In this paper, we want to bridge this gap by introducing RALph, a graph-from the healthcare domain. (ii) Resource assignments specified with RALph questions such as  X  X s the BP consistent regarding the use of resources? X  or achieved by defining the semantics of RALph through its semantic mapping to Resource Assignment Language (RAL) [ 5 ], a textual language for resource assignment whose formal semantics was defined in description logics. (iii) It is independent of any BP modelling language. For that, it can be seamlessly integrated with existing notations (e.g., BPMN), as demonstrated with a proof-of-concept prototype we developed.

Section 4 describes this work and gives an outlook of future work. a graphical notation for resource assignment. 2.1 Running Example Throughout this paper, we will use the process of patient examination as run-ning example. Figure 1 shows this process modelled in BPMN according to the description provided by the Women X  X  Hospital of Ulm. Furthermore, we refer In it, the rectangles with rounded corners represent organisational units that organisational positions within the units; and ellipses represent people occupy the positions defined.

In the former case, the physician fills out the examination form and the patient can by the physician who additionally fills out a request form. Beyond informa-requested and refers to a suitable lab. Furthermore, the outpatient physician sent and agrees to continue with the procedure, a delegate of the physician arranges an appointment of the patient with one of the wards. The latter is appointment, the required examination and sampling is prepared by a nurse of the ward based on the information provided by the outpatient section. Then, a cated in the request form and conducts the follow-up treatment of the patient. whether the sample can be used for analysis or whether it is contaminated and from the outpatient department makes the diagnosis and prescribes the therapy for the patient.

 The main drawback of the graphical notations proposed so far is that they lack formal semantics, which makes them inappropriate for automated resource analysis in BP models. This is the case of the swimlanes offered by the de-facto standard BPMN [ 3 ]. Event-driven Process Chains(EPCs) [ 14 ] also allow semantics are not defined.
 Some approaches have been developed to overcome this drawback. How-of Unified Modeling Language (UML) activity diagrams to define separation of duties and binding of duties between the activities of a process. Some ad-hoc analysis mechanisms have been developed for them as well. However, their scope ties, people X  X  skills or runtime information. Several approaches extended the BPMN metamodel to graphically define specific types of conditions along with duced access-control constraints in BPMN models through an extension based the resource selection conditions is mainly done textually, though graphically associated to BPMN elements, e.g. by making use of BPMN text annotations or group artifacts. 2.3 Requirements for a Graphical Resource Assignment Notation We have studied the related work according to well-defined criteria in order to discover the gaps that should be bridged.

 as evaluation framework to assess the expressiveness of a number of proposals patterns, as they are related to resource selection. These patterns include: resource that will execute a task. only be executed by resources that correspond to a given role. to resources based their organisational position and their relationship with other resources. to different resources in a given BP instance. process instance to the same resource. instance to the same resource that performed a preceding activity instance, when several resources are available to perform it. This pattern is also known as binding of duties. activity to resources based on their specific capabilities. resource that will execute a task until run time. to resources based on their execution history.
 For the sake of brevity, in Table 1 the first three patterns have been grouped grouped as access-control assignments.
 Note that creation patterns Authorisation and Automatic Execution are not assignment language and is inherently supported by all Business Process Man-agement System (BPMS).
 tions for resource assignment are independent of any BP modelling language. Independent notations are likely to be applicable in different domains along with different existing notations. This section presents the RAL graph (RALph) visual notation for specifying resource assignments in BP models. RALph represents resources as different constraints (i.e., separation and binding of duties).
 of RALph have been identified based on the experience we gained in the context representation (cf. Fig. 3) in eleven steps and during discussions with domain experts. 3.1 Graphical Notation The RALph graphical notation provides various visual elements (i.e., entities and connectors) that enable the visual modelling of resource selection condi-as hierarchy connectors or with other activities using history connectors . of another activity, which is connected by a connector that ends up with an a specified period of time (dashed line and calendar symbol).
 diamonds may be used to express that only one of the conditions defined needs negations, connectors can be crossed-out (cf. negated assignment/connector in Fig. 3 ).
 Fig. 4 applies the RALph language to the patient examination process of our the sample. In particular, a nurse and a ward physician of the respective ward are assigned to the tasks prepare examination and take sample and subsequent steps. 3.2 Formal Specification In order to provide a clear syntax as well as to enable the specification of a formal semantics for RALph, this section introduces a set-based definition of RALph. Since RALph extends process models, first of all, Definition 1 provides a fundamental definition of the latter. Note that Definition 1 abstracts from of RALph. For example, types of activities are not specified. Furthermore, all gateways and events, respectively, are combined in one set.
 Definition 1 (Process Model). A process model PM is a tuple (
A, G, E, D, , ) where  X  A is a set of activities,  X  G is a set of gateways,  X  E is a set of events,  X  D is a set of data objects,  X   X  ( A  X  G  X  E )  X  ( A  X  G  X  E ) is a sequence flow relation, and  X   X  ( A  X  D )  X  ( D  X  A ) is an information flow relation.
 and, finally, four functions labeling and annotating entities and connectors. Definition 2 (RAL Graph (RALph)). Let PM =( A, G, E, D, , process model (cf. Definition 1). Further, let L be a set of labels and be the empty string. Then: A RAL graph (RALph) for PM is a tuple  X =( per, ,  X  ,  X  , , ,lbl,hr,hs, X  ) with PM is a tuple  X =( P, S, U, R, C, ,  X  , , ,lbl,hr,hs, X  ) where  X  P is a set of person entities,  X  S is a set of position entities,  X  U is a set of organizational unit entities,  X  R is a set of role entities,  X  C is a set of capability entities,  X  is a set of alternative connectors,  X   X   X  ( A  X  )  X  ( P  X  S  X  U  X  R  X  )  X  ( S  X  U ) are resource assignment connectors,  X   X   X  (( A  X  )  X  S )  X  ( S  X  ( A  X  )) are hierarchy connectors, where function ( d ) or transitive ( t ), and whether it expresses the duty to report work ( or the power to delegate work ( del ) to people according to their positions,  X   X  ( A  X  )  X  A are history connectors, where function hs :  X  X  X  { s, p, sp } X  X  specifies whether a history connector refers to a temporal constraint t  X  X  ,  X   X  D  X  ( P  X  S  X  U  X  R ) are data-driven connectors,  X  lbl : P  X  S  X  U  X  R  X  C  X   X  X  X  L  X  { } labels person, role, position and nectors either with the empty string or the name of the resource, capability or with the data field read by the data-driven connector,  X   X  :  X   X   X   X   X  X  X  { 1 ,  X } specifies whether the connectors are unmodified ( 1 ) or negated (  X  ) -i.e., crossed out in the graphical notation. Note that Definition 2 specifies how the elements of a RALph specification more data-driven connectors may be connected to the same resource entity or sets of nodes and edges as well as a special subgraph of a RALph model. Definition 3 (Nodes, Edges and Subgraphs of a RAL Graph). Let ( A, G, E, D, , ) be a process model (cf. Definition 1) and let  X =( P, S, U, R, C, ,  X  ,  X  , , ,lbl,hr,hs, X  ) be a RAL graph for  X  N
RAL graph  X  , including the activities and data objects of the related process model,  X   X  + :=  X   X   X   X  are the extended resource assignment connectors of RAL graph  X  that also include hierarchy and history connectors,  X  connected to resources of entity type T  X  X  P, S, U, R, C } of  X  P are connected to person entities),  X   X  := ( which is derived from  X  after removing all resource entities and connected edges. Note that G i  X  only includes resource and history connectors. Based on Definition 3, we can specify correctness criteria for RALph. In particular, we specify whether or not a RAL graph is well-formed as follows. Definition 4 (Well-formed RAL Graph). Let PM =( A, G, E, D, , a process model (cf. Definition 1) and let  X =( P, S, U, R, C, , hr, hs,  X  ) be a RAL graph for PM (cf. Definition 2). Then,  X  is well-formed , iff each of the following constraints holds: C2: Data-driven connectors must be always labeled; i.e.,  X  d  X  C4: There exists no cycle of history connectors; i.e., G i formed. However, the interplay of sequence flow, information flow and resource assignments might cause other errors. Further, note that the italic labels in square brackets on the organizational units ward and laboratory in Fig. 4 con-stitute comments that are only used to ease understanding. Therefore, they are not part of the RAL graph; i.e., for both, labeling function string (cf. C1 in Definition 4). We provide RALph with a well-defined semantics to enable its automated analy-and (iii) Its semantics are well-defined, which enables automated analyses of RAL expressions [ 5 ]. In addition, RAL X  X  syntax is close to natural language assignments for some activities 2 of the running example (cf. Fig. 4) together with the expressions that define them in RAL.
 Release patient. The patient is released by the physician who examined her. Make appointment. An appointment is made by checking availability with a Prepare examination. The required examination is prepared by a nurse of In the following, we define the mapping of RALph to RAL as a mapping function  X  : A  X  X  X  RALExpr that maps the resource assignment specified by RALph to any activity a  X  A to a RAL expression. However, we first must introduce three auxiliary mappings, namely:  X  ,  X  and  X  n The label mapping function  X  : P  X  S  X  U  X  R  X  X  X  L  X  L D maps each resource entity to either its label or the data field that specify its name. obtained as the result of prefixing IN DATA FIELD to all l  X  X  all x  X  P  X  S  X  U  X  R :  X  lbl ( x ) =  X   X  ( x )= lbl ( x )  X   X  ( o, x )  X   X   X  ( x )= IS PERSON IN DATA FIELD lbl ( o, x ) The resource selection condition mapping function  X  :  X  + maps resource selection conditions specified by RALph connectors to RAL ex-pressions. Specifically:  X   X  ( o, p )  X   X  P  X   X  ( o, p )= IS  X  ( p )  X   X  ( o, s )  X   X  S  X   X  ( o, s )= HAS POSITION  X  ( s )  X   X  ( o, r )  X   X  R :  X  X  X  ( r, u )  X   X  ,u  X  U  X   X  ( o, r )= HAS ROLE  X  ( r ) IN UNIT  X  Otherwise,  X  ( o, r )= HAS ROLE  X  ( r )  X   X  ( o, u )  X   X  U ,o  X  R  X   X  ( o, u )= HAS UNIT  X  ( u )  X   X  ( o, c )  X   X  C  X   X  ( o, c )= HAS CAPABILITY lbl ( s )  X   X  ( o, s )  X   X  , then:  X  hr ( o, s )=( d, rep )  X   X  ( o, s )= DIRECTLY REPORTS TO POSITION s  X  hr ( o, s )=( t, rep )  X   X  ( o, s )= REPORTS TO POSITION s  X  hr ( o, s )=( t, del )  X   X  ( o, s )= CAN DELEGATE WORK TO POSITION s  X   X  ( o, a )  X  , then:  X  hr ( o, a )= s  X   X  ( o, a )= IS ANY PERSON responsible for ACTIVITY a  X  hr ( o, a )= p  X   X  ( o, a )= IS ANY PERSON responsible for ACTIVITY a IN  X  hr ( o, a )= sp  X   X  ( o, a )= IS ANY PERSON responsible for ACTIVITY a  X  hr ( o, a )= { t  X   X  ( o, )  X   X   X   X  ( o, )= (  X  n ( ,x 1 ) ) OR ... OR (  X  n (  X  + with 1  X  i  X  n .
 The negation mapping function  X  n :  X  +  X  X  X  RALExpr extends mapping function  X  by taking negations into account. Specifically,  X   X  ( o, x )=  X  X   X  n ( o, x )= NOT (  X  ( o, x ) )  X   X  ( o, x )=1  X   X  n ( o, x )=  X  ( o, x ) Finally, since RALph applies an AND-semantics for all resource selection conditions defined for an activity, the mapping of RALph to RAL RALExpr can be defined as follows:  X  ( a )= (  X  n ( a, x 1 for all ( a, x i )  X   X  + with 1  X  i  X  n .
 The evaluation of RALph described below is two-fold. On the one hand, we assess its expressive power using the workflow resource patterns as evaluation framework. On the other hand, its usage with existing BP modelling notations has been tested by integrating it into a platform that uses BPMN for process assignments defined in the real scenario from Section 2.1. 5.1 Support for the Workflow Resource Patterns were used for the evaluation of existing approaches in Section 2.3:  X  Direct Allocation . Connection of resource entity Person to an activity.  X  Role-Based Allocation . Connection of resource entity Role to an activity.  X  Case Handling . To implement this pattern with RALph, we should specify  X  Retain Familiar . Connection of two activities with a history connector that indicates that the activity instances belong to the same BP instance: e.g., activities Release patient and Inform about risks (cf. Fig. 4) have a binding of duties with activity Examine patient .  X  History-Based Allocation . Connection of two activities with a history con-nector that indicates that the referenced activity belongs to (i) the same or any previous BP instance, (ii) a previous BP instance, or (iii) any BP instance executed within a specific period of time. ity, e.g. in activities Examine patient and Make diagnosis of Fig. 4. 5.2 Implementation This editor is based on Oryx [ 22 ], which is an open X  X ource platform to build web X  X ased diagram editors. Oryx provides native support for several graphical notations such as BPMN, and allows for the definition of new graphical nota-tions by means of the so X  X alled stencil sets . Consequently, RALph has been implemented as an Oryx stencil set that extends the Oryx X  X ative BPMN stencil set with the symbols described in this paper. Figure 5 depicts a screenshot of RALph web X  X ased editor. resource assignments in BP models. RALph is more expressive than existing a means to automate the analysis of the BP resource perspective. Hence, RALph existing gap in BP modelling notations for the resource perspective and eases the way resources are handled by non-technical users. In addition, RALph is independent of any BP modelling notation.
 There are several directions for future work. First, we want to assess RALph X  X  expressive power with more use cases. Second, we want to evaluate its under-standability and learnability by conducting experiments with end users. The performed, or there may be resources that must be informed when the activity has been completed (cf. the Generic Human Roles defined in BPEL4People [ 19 ] specify resource selection conditions.
