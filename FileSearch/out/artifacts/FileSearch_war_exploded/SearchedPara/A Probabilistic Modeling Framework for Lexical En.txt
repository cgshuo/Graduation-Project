 Textual Entailment was proposed as a generic paradigm for applied semantic inference (Dagan et al., 2006). This task requires deciding whether a tex-tual statement (termed the hypothesis -H ) can be in-ferred (entailed) from another text (termed the text -T ). Since it was first introduced, the six rounds of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) chal-lenges 1 , currently organized under NIST, have be-come a standard benchmark for entailment systems.
These systems tackle their complex task at vari-ous levels of inference, including logical represen-tation (Tatu and Moldovan, 2007; MacCartney and Manning, 2007), semantic analysis (Burchardt et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Inference at these levels usually requires substantial processing and resources (e.g. parsing) aiming at high performance.

Nevertheless, simple entailment methods, per-forming at the lexical level, provide strong baselines which most systems did not outperform (Mirkin et al., 2009; Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010). Within complex systems, lexical entailment model-ing is an important component. Finally, there are cases in which a full system cannot be used (e.g. lacking a parser for a targeted language) and one must resort to the simpler lexical approach.
While lexical entailment methods are widely used, most of them apply ad hoc heuristics which do not rely on a principled underlying framework. Typ-ically, such methods quantify the degree of lexical coverage of the hypothesis terms by the text X  X  terms. Coverage is determined either by a direct match of identical terms in T and H or by utilizing lexi-cal semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), that capture lexical entailment relations (de-noted here as entailment rule s). Common heuristics for quantifying the degree of coverage are setting a threshold on the percentage coverage of H  X  X  terms (Majumdar and Bhattacharyya, 2010), counting ab-solute number of uncovered terms (Clark and Har-rison, 2010), or applying an Information Retrieval-style vector space similarity score (MacKinlay and Baldwin, 2009). Other works (Corley and Mihal-cea, 2005; Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) have ap-plied a heuristic formula to estimate the similarity between text fragments based on a similarity func-tion between their terms.

These heuristics do not capture several important aspects of entailment, such as varying reliability of entailment resources and the impact of rule chaining and multiple evidence on entailment likelihood. An additional observation from these and other systems is that their performance improves only moderately when utilizing lexical resources 2 .

We believe that the textual entailment field would benefit from more principled models for various en-tailment phenomena. Inspired by the earlier steps in the evolution of Statistical Machine Translation methods (such as the initial IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), we formulate a concrete generative prob-abilistic modeling framework that captures the basic aspects of lexical entailment. Parameter estimation is addressed by an EM-based approach, which en-ables estimating the hidden lexical-level entailment parameters from entailment annotations which are available only at the sentence-level.

While heuristic methods are limited in their abil-ity to wisely integrate indications for entailment, probabilistic methods have the advantage of be-ing extendable and enabling the utilization of well-founded probabilistic methods such as the EM algo-rithm.

We compared the performance of several model variations to previously published results on RTE data sets, as well as to our own implementation of typical lexical baselines. Results show that both the probabilistic model and our percentage-coverage baseline perform favorably relative to prior art. These results support the viability of the proba-bilistic framework while pointing at certain model-ing aspects that need to be improved. Under the lexical entailment scope, our modeling goal is obtaining a probabilistic score for the like-lihood that all H X  X  terms are entailed by T. To that end, we model prominent aspects of lexical entail-ment, which were mostly neglected by previous lex-ical methods: (1) distinguishing different reliabil-ity levels of lexical resources; (2) allowing transi-tive chains of rule applications and considering their length when estimating their validity; and (3) con-sidering multiple entailments when entailing a term.

Hypothesis: 2.1 Model Description For T to entail H it is usually a necessary, but not sufficient, that every term h  X  H would be en-tailed by at least one term t  X  T (Glickman et al., 2006). Figure 1 describes the process of entailing hypothesis terms. The trivial case is when identical terms, possibly at the stem or lemma level, appear in T and H (a direct match as t n and h m in Fig-ure 1). Alternatively, we can establish entailment based on knowledge of entailing lexical-semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and mor-phological derivations, available in lexical resources (e.g the rule inference  X  reasoning from WordNet). We denote by R ( r ) the resource which provided the rule r .

Since entailment is a transitive relation, rules may compose transitive chain s that connect a term t  X  T to a term h  X  H through intermediate terms. For instance, from the rules infer  X  inference and infer-ence  X  reasoning we can deduce the rule infer  X  reasoning (were inference is the intermediate term as t 0 in Figure 1).

Multiple chains may connect t to h (as for t j and h i in Figure 1) or connect several terms in T to h (as t 1 and t j are indicating the entailment of h i in Figure 1), thus providing multiple evidence for h  X  X  entailment. It is reasonable to expect that if a term t indeed entails a term h , it is likely to find evidences for this relation in several resources.

Taking a probabilistic perspective, we assume a parameter  X  R for each resource R , denoting its re-liability, i.e. the prior probability that applying a rule from R corresponds to a valid entailment in-stance. Direct matches are considered as a special  X  X esource X , called MATCH , for which  X  MATCH is ex-pected to be close to 1.

We now present our probabilistic model. For a text term t  X  T to entail a hypothesis term h by a chain c , denoted by t c  X  X  X  h , the application of every r  X  c must be valid. Note that a rule r in a chain c connects two terms (its left-hand-side and its right-hand-side, denoted lhs  X  rhs ). The lhs of the first rule in c is t  X  T and the rhs of the last rule in it is h  X  H . We denote the event of a valid rule applica-tion by lhs r  X  X  X  rhs . Since a-priori a rule r is valid with probability  X  R ( r ) , and assuming independence of all r  X  c , we obtain Eq. 1 to specify the prob-ability of the event t c  X  X  X  h . Next, let C ( h ) denote the set of chains which suggest the entailment of h . The probability that T does not entail h at all (by any chain), specified in Eq. 2, is the probability that all these chains are not valid. Finally, the probabil-ity that T entails all of H , assuming independence of H  X  X  terms, is the probability that every h  X  H is entailed, as given in Eq. 3. Notice that there could be a term h which is not covered by any available rule chain. Under this formulation, we assume that each such h is covered by a single rule coming from a special  X  X esource X  called UNCOVERED (expecting  X  p ( T 9 h ) = Y p ( T  X  H ) = Y
As can be seen, our model indeed distinguishes varying resource reliability, decreases entailment probability as rule chains grow and increases it when entailment of a term is supported by multiple chains.
The above treatment of uncovered terms in H , as captured in Eq. 3, assumes that their entailment probability is independent of the rest of the hypoth-esis. However, when the number of covered hypoth-esis terms increases the probability that the remain-ing terms are actually entailed by T increases too (even though we do not have supporting knowledge for their entailment). Thus, an alternative model is to group all uncovered terms together and estimate the overall probability of their joint entailment as a function of the lexical coverage of the hypothesis. We denote H c as the subset of H  X  X  terms which are covered by some rule chain and H uc as the remain-ing uncovered part. Eq. 3a then provides a refined entailment model for H , in which the second term specifies the probability that H uc is entailed given that H c is validly entailed and the corresponding lengths: p ( T  X  H ) = [ Y 2.2 Parameter Estimation The difficulty in estimating the  X  R values is that these are term-level parameters while the RTE-training entailment annotation is given for the sentence-level. Therefore, we use EM-based esti-mation for the hidden parameters (Dempster et al., 1977). In the E step we use the current  X  R values to compute all w hcr ( T,H ) values for each training pair. w hcr ( T,H ) stands for the posterior probability that application of the rule r in the chain c for h  X  H is valid, given that either T entails H or not accord-ing to the training annotation (see Eq. 4). Remember that a rule r provides an entailment relation between its left-hand-side ( lhs ) and its right-hand-side ( rhs ). Therefore Eq. 4 uses the notation lhs r  X  X  X  rhs to des-ignate the application of the rule r (similar to Eq. 1).
E : w hcr ( T,H ) = After applying Bayes X  rule we get a fraction with Eq. 3 in its denominator and  X  R ( r ) as the second term of the numerator. The first numerator term is defined as in Eq. 3 except that for the corresponding rule ap-plication we substitute  X  R ( r ) by 1 (per the condition-ing event). The probabilistic model defined by Eq. 1-3 is a loop-free directed acyclic graphical model (aka a Bayesian network). Hence the E-step proba-bilities can be efficiently calculated using the belief propagation algorithm (Pearl, 1988).
 The M step uses Eq. 5 to update the parameter set. For each resource R we average the w hcr ( T,H ) val-ues for all its rule applications in the training, whose total number is denoted n R .

M :  X  R =
For Eq. 3a we need to estimate also p ( T  X  H uc | | H c | , | H | ) . This is done directly via maximum likeli-hood estimation over the training set, by calculating the proportion of entailing examples within the set of all examples of a given hypothesis length ( | H | ) and a given number of covered terms ( | H c | ). As | H c | we take the number of identical terms in T and H (exact match) since in almost all cases terms in H which have an exact match in T are indeed en-tailed. We also tried initializing the EM algorithm with these direct estimations but did not obtain per-formance improvements. The 5 th Recognizing Textual Entailment challenge (RTE-5) introduced a new search task (Bentivogli et al., 2009) which became the main task in RTE-6 (Bentivogli et al., 2010). In this task participants should find all sentences that entail a given hypothe-sis in a given document cluster. This task X  X  data sets reflect a natural distribution of entailments in a cor-pus and demonstrate a more realistic scenario than the previous RTE challenges.

In our system, sentences are tokenized and stripped of stop words and terms are lemmatized and tagged for part-of-speech. As lexical resources we use WordNet ( WN ) (Fellbaum, 1998), taking as en-tailment rules synonyms, derivations, hyponyms and meronyms of the first senses of T and H terms, and the CatVar (Categorial Variation) database (Habash and Dorr, 2003). We allow rule chains of length up to 4 in WordNet ( WN 4 ).

We compare our model to two types of baselines: (1) RTE published results: the average of the best runs of all systems, the best and second best per-forming lexical systems and the best full system of each challenge; (2) our implementation of lexical coverage model, tuning the percentage-of-coverage threshold for entailment on the training set. This model uses the same configuration as our probabilis-tic model. We also implemented an Information Re-trieval style baseline 3 (both with and without lex-ical expansions), but given its poorer performance we omit its results here.

Table 1 presents the results. We can see that both our implemented models (probabilistic and coverage) outperform all RTE lexical baselines on both data sets, apart from (Majumdar and Bhat-tacharyya, 2010) which incorporates additional lex-ical resources, a named entity recognizer and a co-reference system. On RTE-5, the probabilis-tic model is comparable in performance to the best full system, while the coverage model achieves con-siderably better results. We notice that our imple-mented models successfully utilize resources to in-crease performance, as opposed to typical smaller or less consistent improvements in prior works (see Section 1).

While the probabilistic and coverage models are comparable on RTE-6 (with non-significant advan-tage for the former), on RTE-5 the latter performs better, suggesting that the probabilistic model needs to be further improved. In particular, WN 4 performs better than the single-step WN only on RTE-5, sug-gesting the need to improve the modeling of chain-ing. The fluctuations over the data sets and impacts of resources suggest the need for further investiga-tion over additional data sets and resources. As for the coverage model, under our configuration it poses a bigger challenge for RTE systems than perviously reported baselines. It is thus proposed as an easy to implement baseline for future entailment research. This paper presented, for the first time, a principled and relatively rich probabilistic model for lexical en-tailment, amenable for estimation of hidden lexical-level parameters from standard sentence-level an-notations. The positive results of the probabilistic model compared to prior art and its ability to exploit lexical resources indicate its future potential. Yet, further investigation is needed. For example, analyz-ing current model X  X  limitations, we observed that the multiplicative nature of eqs. 1 and 3 (reflecting inde-pendence assumptions) is too restrictive, resembling a logical AND. Accordingly we plan to explore re-laxing this strict conjunctive behavior through mod-els such as noisy-AND (Pearl, 1988). We also in-tend to explore the contribution of our model, and particularly its estimated parameter values, within a complex system that integrates multiple levels of in-ference.
