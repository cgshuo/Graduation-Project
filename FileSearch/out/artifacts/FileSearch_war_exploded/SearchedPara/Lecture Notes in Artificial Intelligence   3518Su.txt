He played a key leadership role in nurturing and establ ishing the PAKDD conferences to become inaugural PAKDD (1997). He was honored with the inaugural PAKDD Distinguished and services to the advancement of the PAKDD community and series of conferences. community. He was elected as a Trustee of the VLDB Endowment in 2000. He was a member of the Advisory Board of ACM SIGMOD (1998 X 2002). He was an Editor for databases. Professor Lu passed away on March 3 from complications arising from his treatment important issues related to query processing and optimization, data warehousing and scientific endeavors for many years to come. as a caring, considerate and compassionate friend to very many.
