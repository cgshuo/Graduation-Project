 Tencent Inc. is the biggest social network company in China. Its WeChat and QQ boast of 700 million and 800 million monthly active users (MAU), respectively. Sogou Inc., on the other hand, is a search leader in China, being the No. 2 and No. 3 on mobile/PC search market, respectiv ely. This talk introduces how Tencent and Sogou join force on th e battele of mobile search. Specifically, we discuss two products, namely WeChat Search and WeChat Headline, and illustrate how they leverage the strength of both companies to take the market. We further dive under the hood, and examine technical problems and solutions. In particular, we focus on unique aspects due to the particularities of WeChat, e.g., millions of articles generated from about 1 million official accounts, which are forwarded and broadcasted by hundreds of millions of users across the world. Some problems, e.g., de-duplication and ranking, might be similar to traditional IR, but some other aspects are not. In the end, we put forward some challenges for open discu ssion, and solicit comments from academia and fellow practitioners.
