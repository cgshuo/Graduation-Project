 Why do people start a search? Why do they stop? Why do they do what they do in-between? Our goal in this paper is to provide a simple yet general explanation for these acts that has its basis in neuropsychology and observed user behavior. We coin the term  X  X ngram X , as an information c ounterpart to Richard Semon's  X  X ngram X  or "memory trace". People search to create ingrams. People stop searching because they have created sufficient ingrams, or given up. We descri be these acts through a pair of user models and use it to explain various user behaviors in search activity. Understanding people X  X  search acts in terms of ingrams may help us predict or model the interaction of people X  X  information needs, the queries they issue, and the information they consume. If we could obser ve certain decision-making acts within these activities, we might also gain new insight into the relationships between textua l information and knowledge representation. To build better interactive information seeking systems, we need to understand more clearly why people search, how they formulate search queries, and what activities lead them to be satisfied (or not) with the information they c hoose to consume. It is very challenging to build a comprehensive model of what a person knows, or of what they do not know. However, by observing users directly or indirectly through their long-term and short-term interactions with information se eking systems, we can propose a model for changes in knowledge that occur. The model should be consistent with the observed search behavior. By focusing solely on knowledge state changes, our m odel, while less comprehensive or accurate than more contextually situated models, may prove more amenable to extraction of significant events that can be used as data for machine learni ng algorithms building text-to-knowledge relationships. For example, a query such as [olives] provides us relatively little information about the motivati on and information need of a searcher. If instead we observe a sequence of queries: [olives]; [when to harvest olives]; [olive picking technique], interspersed by various examined document summaries on the corresponding search results pages and also spec ific clicked documents, we have a much richer set of data from which to infer the changes in the searcher X  X  knowledge. In Secti on 3, we name and describe concepts for specific neuropsychological knowledge states that arise throughout the search process. but does not proceed to describe subsequent knowledge changes. Like Taylor, Nordlie conducted a comparative study within a library information seeking environment, which suggests dialogue-based interaction might help improve search processes [15]. Nordlie X  X  observations also suggest that the human intermediary must construct (through their dialog with the searcher) their own mental model of the desired goal so they can assist the searcher, a process he describes as  X  X evealment X . Belkin et al developed an influential theory of anomalous states of knowledge ASK (that a user comp rehends an anomaly in their current state of understanding), akin to the visceral need level of Taylor, and applied it to the task of improving information retrieval systems [2]. Our explanation aligns with this visceral need or anomalous state as a starting neurophysiological frame. Kuhlthau X  X  Information Search Process framework is also influential, describing a 6-stage se ries of tasks, with associated thoughts, feelings, actions and stra tegies [9]; we seek a simpler explanation. Pirolli et al developed an Information Foraging model, inspired from anthropologi cal theories of food seeking behavior to describe information s eeking [16]; again, this has been influential in our explanation of partially attained states in completion of an information seeking task. Recently Azzopardi proposed an economic theory of us er behavior to describe the choices made during searching, hy pothesizing that users seek to minimize cognitive load [1]. We see this as primarily an operational explanation of search activity, rather than our focus which is more on changes in information and knowledge acquisition. We coin the term  X  X ngram X , as an information counterpart to Richard Semon's hypothetical  X  X ngram X  [17]. In neuropsychology, the engram is a memory trace that has been physically encoded in the brain. Though science lacks a comprehensive understanding of this, it is still useful to hypothesize that there must be some biophysical or biochemical change in the brain to support the encoding and retrieval of a memory. Just as an engram is an encoding of memory there must be some changes in the brain that occur during information seeking. We propose the ingram as the change in the brain, comprising one or more engrams, that occur duri ng a given information seeking process. The main outcome and motivation for search is a change in knowledge [9][16], and that change as encoded in the brain is an ingram. In programmatic terms we might denote this as: SearchProcess(Person)  X  Person X , s.t. Person X  = Person+Ingram That is, on successfully completing a search process, a person has now incorporated an ingram within their knowledge memory. For example, suppose we have an olive tree in our garden, and wish to know when and how best to harvest the olive fruits, yet have never done so previously. Without a lot of trial and error, the olives may go unharvested, or be harvested at the wrong time, or be harvested but damaged. Inst ead, given access to appropriate search engine technology and assu ming that our search process is successful, we subsequently know what months to pick olives and how to avoid bruising them, without ever having picked an olive still. These engrams, as encodings in the brain, constitute the ingram of the olive harvesting search process. While simple search intents (for example, navigational search [3] or refinding activities [19]) may be satisfied by a single query-document pair, many are not. As described by Cole et al [5] while investigating the practical applic ation of Belkin X  X  ASK model for information retrieval [2], there may be an  X  X ssue of unknown item information need and the non-specifiab ility of this sort of need X . In fact, it is perhaps even more complex  X  there are the  X  X nown unknowns X  that we seek and can partially name when our search process commences, and there are the  X  X nknown unknowns X  that we only discover during the process of seeking itself. We believe that a common example of th ese  X  X nknown unknowns X  occurs when searchers acquire vocabulary while reading documents, such that they subsequently employ some of these words as query terms that lead to satisfied search activity. Overall, what we see is that many search sessions require multiple queries and entail extended information discovery and progressive learning [7]. To characterize the partial information accumulation aspect of search processes, we need one additional concept  X  the  X  X ingram X  (like a micro or minimal or most of an ingram). A mingram arises in the searche r X  X  knowledge memory when some useful piece of content is compre hended as part of the information seeking process in order to form the final ingram. Once a sufficient set of mingrams have been assembled, the searcher may determine that the ingram is complete, and cease their search task. Conversely a searcher may be able to assemble a number of mingrams, but still be unable to complete their ingram. At this point, they may either abandon their search altogether, or continue their search process with new queries, browsing, or re-queries. Mingrams have an analog in the relevance measurement domain, being the  X  X nformation nugget X  con cept described by Voorhees in the TREC Question Answering track [21], and Clarke et al X  X  work on novelty and diversity [4]. Returning to the olive example, one mingram may represent a document passage stating that that olives are best harvested in the fall or autumn season. Another mingram may be an illustrated document showing that the olives change color progressively, and these colors correspond to levels of acid in the fruit. A final mingram may be a video showing that harvesting needs to be careful, as the fruit will easily br uise, and suggest containers and receptacles that can limit bruising of the fruit. Collectively, these three mingrams then lead to the ingram that was sufficient for the user to conclude the information seeking session. The three primary search process patterns (success, partial success, and no success) can thus be represented by state diagrams which show the sequencing of prei ngram to ingram via mingrams, with interactions to a search engine and documents. A successful search process is shown in Figure 1, a partially successful search process is shown in Figure 2, and an unsuccessful search process is shown in Figure 3. Note that these are all relatively simple models, and make no account of interrupted search processes (where they extend beyond a single session) or parallel search processes (where multiple goals are pursued within a single session). Arguably, both of these more complex behaviors can be captured by reducing the activities involved to aggregates of these simple forms. We now turn our attention to how our neuropsychological explanation of why people search corresponds to a couple of search user behavior models. These models have been developed to explain observed user behavi or from log-based analysis and In Figure 4, we illustrate the equivalence stages between the simplest cascade model and the i ngram explanations. The query is assumed in the cascade model, and the equivalence is a preingram. As the searcher examines each summary, a mingram may (or may not) be created, depending on the content of the summary. Then, after clicking the document, the searcher reads it (and does not return), which corresponds to the creation of the ingram. Ignoring  X  X ood abandonmen t X  scenarios [10], we can make a simplifying assumption that the summaries of skipped documents (ones which are not clic ked) do not create mingrams at all. The decision to click becomes the critical factor in this model. Deciding not to click means we can ignore these documents. Deciding to click means we need to examine the summary as a candidate for mingram creation, and the full document for both mingram and ingram creation. There have been several enhancements to the cascade model. In one of the most comprehensive, recent efforts by Moffat, Thomas and Scholer have focused on usi ng gaze tracking from user studies to understand actual summary ex amination behavior, document reading behavior, and query refo rmulations. Thes e observations were used to describe new user models and metrics that may be more aligned to real behavior than some existing relevance metrics [14][20]. In particular, their user model specifically encompasses query reformulatio ns, and also query abandonment independent of having found relevant material. In Figure 5, we illustrate the equivalence stages between their combined user behavior model (Fig.s 6 and 7 from [14]) and the ingram explanations. We note that this user model is still not quite in alignment with the observed us er behavior reported in [20], where the authors found examination of multiple summaries in a  X  X indow X  of attention prior to clic king. In contrast to Figure 4, we place a question-mark after Ingram, as the user model acknowledges that users may abandon at any time, without being successful, and we align it with the  X  X nd session X  termination point in the process, rather than the  X  X ead document X  activity. We model. Again, for simplicity we assume that a summary that is skipped does not contribute to creation of a mingram. Summaries that are clicked may create a mingram, as may the clicked document itself. Query re formulation is now s een as a significant act, as it indicates that an ingram has not yet been created. It is only when the search session ends that an ingram may (or may not) have been created; this is a less deterministic outcome than with the cascade model. In both the cascade model and the user behavior-based model, the mapping of preingram, mingrams and ingram to the user actions and decisions being made (exa mining summaries, clicking links and reading documents, reformulati ng queries) are consistent with the three search processes we described in Section 3. The observable acts of users, and the decisions we can infer are being made by them, in conjunction with our hypothesized neuropsychological changes, provide us with an opportunity to focus future experiments on these critical points within a searcher X  X  information seeking process. Future advances in detecting and understanding brain activities (e.g. [12]) may also enable us to observe these transitions, from preingram to mingram, and from mingrams to ingram. Similarly, characterizing the neuro-physiological changes occurring in searchers X  brains throughout a search process may help us more effectively focus
