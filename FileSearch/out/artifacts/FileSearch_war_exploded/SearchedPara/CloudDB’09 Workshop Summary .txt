 This is the first workshop in CIKM conference that addresses the challenge of large data management based on cloud computing infrastructure. This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in cloud computing and data-intensive system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific applications, and information-based applications to maximize performance, mi nimize cost and improve the scale of their endeavors. Totally this workshop attracted 11 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 8 papers, among which there are 5 full papers and 3 short papers. Topics of accepted papers includes query processing &amp; index, service in the Cloud, platform availability, Cloud system implementation, data replication and so on. These proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for cloud data management researchers and developers. Paper  X  X ersonalization as a Service: Arch itecture and Case Study X  focuses on how to provide personalized services for individual user s in the cloud environment. Guo et al. first analyze the main issues and challenges of using the traditional serv er-side user roles for personalized services in the cloud. Then they present the architecture of Personalizati on as a Service (PaaS) in which the client-side user m odeling method is employed to support personalized cloud services. In paper  X  X uery Processing of Massive Trajectory Data based on MapReduce X , a ne w framework for query processing over trajectory data based on MapReduce is presented by Ma et al. Traditional trajectory data partitioning, indexing, and query processing technologies are extended so that they may fully utilize the highly parallel processing power of large-scale clusters. In paper  X  X n Efficient Multi-Dimensional Index for Cloud Data Management X , Zhang et al. proposed an efficient approach to build multi-dimensional index for Cloud computing system. They use the combination of R-tree and KD-tree to organize data records and offer fast query processing and efficient index maintenance. In Paper  X  X ow Replicated Data Management in the Cloud can benefit from a Data Grid Protocol  X  the Re:GRIDiT Approach X , Cristiana et al. developed, implemented and evaluated the Re:GRIDiT protocol for managing data in the Grid. In paper  X  X everaging a Scal able Row Store to Build a Distributed Text Index X , Li et al. developed a distributed text index called HIndex, by judiciously exploiting the control layer of HBase, which is an open source implementation of Google X  X  Bigtable. In  X  X he Design of Distributed Real-time Video Analytic infrastructure VAP (Video Analytic Platform) for supporting real-time vi deo stream analysis. In paper  X  X acking the Most Onto Your Cloud X , Aboulnaga et al. presented a scheduler that takes job characteristics into account and finds a schedu le that minimizes the total completion time of the set of jobs. In  X  X adoop High Availability through Metadata Replication X , Wang et al. proposed a metadata replication based solution to enable Hadoop high availability by removing single point of failure in Hadoop. These papers cover a variety of topics. We believe that these papers will provide researchers and developers with a brief glimpse into this exciting new technology, specifically from the perspective of data management and data intensive applications. We hope you enjoy reading the papers and attending our workshop.
