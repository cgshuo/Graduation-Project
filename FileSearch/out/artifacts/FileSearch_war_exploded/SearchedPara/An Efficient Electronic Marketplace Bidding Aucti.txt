 problem to improve MAGNET in 2004 [2]. The proposed major modification is the use and anonymous communication to hide the iden tities of the bidders. According to this, the MAGNET is improved in security. But the improved protocol still has some anonymity disclosure weakness, collusion between a customer and a certain supplier. constructs a simple interpolating polynomial for sharing the determination process data in supplier group who have taken part in this auction. Sharing the determination process data can totally avoid collusion between a customer and a certain supplier. 
In 2003, Chang et al. proposed an anonymous auction protocol, they applied a sim-weaknesses in initial phase of Chang et al. X  X  protocol, so they improved it and proved improvement, Chang et al. proposed the enhancement with the alias in their protocol auction properties was proposed by Liaw et al. in 2006. By comparison with Hwang et [7]. By comparative analysis with those protocols, the proposed protocol shows good security and less computation cost. 2.1 Jaiswal X  X  Protocol close and winner determination phase. 2.1.1 Planning The customer sends a signed RFQ message () S is secret key of the customer. 2.1.2 Bidding The supplier receives the RFQ through the publish/subscribe system. If interested, the M = [( #, ), { ( )}, { ( )}] by a supplier to the market. The supplier can also check the publish/subscribe system and verify that whether its bid was actually received and displayed by the market. The supplier agent would construct a puzzle that would take the customer longer than the auction deadline to solve. 2.1.3 Auction Close form, along with the customer X  X  copy: ((,)), ((,)) would then pass on the customer X  X  portion of the encrypted key: ((,)) 2.1.4 Winner Determination The customer agent uses various algorithms to determine the winner from the bids it has received. Once the winner has been determined, it would use the market X  X  white-board to notify suppliers (#,) the publish/subscribe system any supplier can check to see if it is the winner. 2.2 Vulnerabilities 2.2.1 Replay Attack The Jaiswal et al. X  X  protocol is vulnerable to the replay data attack. We suppose that an attacker has eavesdropped and intercepted messages sent by suppliers for a period of E RFQ number and other data blocks are old data blocks. The market just publish ( RFQ#, freshness of this message. When auction is closed, the attacker sends message E X  former replay messages, market cannot verify whether this message is a replay data or not, and the case of the customer is similar with market. Only after the customer de-crypts data and checks the bid data carefully, he might identify whether this message is replay data or not. 2.2.2 Customer Collusion customer take sides with a certain supplier. After customer knew all suppliers X  identi-which is unfair to the others in process. So we should have a mechanism to inform the other suppliers of the bid determination process data to avoid collusions. conveys RFQs from customer to supplier agents, communicates the bids from supplier agent back to customer agent, keep records of all the transactions of RFQs and bids, assumptions for three-party as: customer agent will not collude with any of the supplier customer wants to collude with a supplier. Also we allow the customer agent commu-nicating with the supplier agents to exchange information. We will introduce how we can relax these trust assumptions for three-party in later section. 4.1 Key Techniques 4.1.1 Ticket Token For our auction scheme, we need a secure authentication system for group communi-participant in supplier group. So we import the concept of Conference key distribution into our auction scheme. The concept of conference key distribution was first proposed scheme and improved it by adding verification phase [10]. Because of adopting pub-thermore, the participant suppliers should be anonymous to market and customer. Also ticket token can help avoid DOS attack to some extent. 4.1.2 LPN-Based Authentication At first, we introduce the Learning parity with noise (LPN) problem. The LPN problem NP-complete [11]. Several authentication protocols based on LPN problem were proposed, and most representative of them were HB protocol and HB + protocol [12]. Also Gilbert proposed that HB + is not secure against a man-in-the-middle attack [13]. 
When we import the LPN-based authentication into our auction scheme, we are one round of our LPN-based authentication. 
The condition when HB + protocol attack happen is that the attacker can manipulate show the message which suppliers have sent, so suppliers can check and verify whether their own data message was actually received and displayed by market. We assume that there is an attacker in the middle, and he can manipulate the message sent by a supplier tacker doesn X  X  have any opportunity to disturb the authentication process. 4.2 Proposed Scheme The proposed protocol has the following phases: planning, bidding, auction close and following: 
For convenience, we assume there are n 1 customers and n 2 suppliers and one market in our auction scheme. In order to guarantee the reliability and safety among market, pre-distribution long-term key process. Diffie-Hellman scheme, CA assigns a secret key x i the secret key x i x  X  Z * q 2 and computes public key i 2 where 1  X  i 2  X  n 2 +1. Then, CA gives the secret key x i secure way. CA assigns two symmetric key x i plier and market, where 1  X  i 3  X  n 2 +1. Then, CA gives the symmetric secret key x i y to each supplier and market in a secure way. 4.2.1 Planning A customer sends a RFQ message which is signed by his secret key S k c to market for publishing. After receiving the RFQ message, market verify and publish it. After that, 
Market performs the following steps to construct ticket token polynomial: t from the system and compute 2 Compute the secret key shared by each supplier as: 3 Market constructs ticket token polynomial f(x) for publishing. 4 Market publishes A, B, t, c n-1 ,c n-2 ,......c 1 ,c 0 . 4.2.2 Bidding If a supplier S is interested in this auction session, S will 1 Get A, B, t, c n-1 ,c n-2 ,......c 1 ,c 0 from market X  X  publish board. 2 Check the timestamp t is a valid data or not. 3 Compute the secret key shared with market as: 4 Get ticket token by computing f(k i 5 Verify ticket token T by computing H( t||A ) and check the equation getting dsn and r from market, the supplier generates a bid-message comprising of RFQ block signed by supplier X  X  secret key S k s . After receiving messages came from suppli-ers, Market publishes all ( RFQ#, (dsn, M, hash(M)) ) on publish board. Suppliers can check and verify whether their own bid-message was actually received and displayed by market. 4.2.3 Auction Close thentication method. After that, market publishes notice which announced whether the S displayed by market. Market publish RFQ#, E p (dsn n ,r n ,k a message market published, customer download corresponding M from the pub-lish/subscribe system and decrypt data block and get all valid bid information. Having authenticated supplier group twice, market can make sure that he would publish valid supplier X  X  information. 4.2.4 Winner Determination checks whether the winner contained in legal supplier list (dsn 1 ,r 1 ,k a ......(dsn n ,r n ,k a c Market encrypts bid determination process data and publish RFQ# , E k (bid determina-tion process data) . 5.1 Replaying Attack r into message ( M ) which the suppliers sends to market in bidding phase. Furthermore, a replay data to cheat market. In bidding phase, the market utilizes publish/subscribe LPN-based method first. During the LPN-based authentication, the market will choose message are published on board each time. So even if there is an attacker use replay data to send market, he will not pass the authentication. According to what is mentioned above, we do not worry about the replay data. 5.2 Man-in-the-Middle Attacks impersonates a legitimate supplier by intercepting exchanged message.In bidding the hash( M ) on the publish board.When auction is closed, S X  tries to disturb LPN-base authentication process. But he also canno t succeed because he cannot solve the LPN problem, also S X  cannot modify the message which a supplier sent to market, because market will publish the data on board, every legitimate supplier can check the infor-mation. After authenticating, the legitimate supplier will send S Sks (dsn, r, x i opportunity for attacker to cheating. 
So It is impossible to S X  to disturb auction process by intercepting or modifying data block. According to this, the mechanism between the communication parties can avoid Man-in-the-middle attack. 5.3 DOS (Denial-Of-Service) Attack communication protocols. The study showed broadcast networks can be safe using some method under some situation, the ticket token mechanism is a good solution for our auction protocol [14, 15]. Each legitimate supplier can get ticket token from ticket token polynomial, interested suppliers utilize ticket tokens to download the RFQ . This method can efficiently avoid some attackers taking part in bid-process. And the data dsn and r will be embedded in the message ( M ) for checking. When a supplier sends M E {S S ks (bid)}) separately. This improvement will make market identify junk data effi-ciently and relieve DOS attack on market to some extent. 5.4 Public Verifiability and Avoid Collusion After market published the winner information on board, if there is a controversy about winner, market constructs key interpolating polynomial for sharing the bid determina-
Winner publication every supplier or not. In this section, we discuss the proposed protocol with other protocols. The first com-parison is summarized in table 1 [5, 7]. 
There isn X  X  a deliberate mechanism which can avoid opening bid before bidding phase one besides bidder himself can access bids before bidding phase is closed. to collude with a certain bidder, they can break the anonymity of bidders. But in the proposed protocol, no one but the bidder himself can open encryption before bidding phase is closed. This is a way that can guarantee identity non-disclosure independently. manner. But Liaw et al. X  X  protocol uses random number for non-repudiation, we must we cannot know it exactly. length is 128 bits (for AES), hash function digest is 160 bits (for SHA-1), public key computation operation can be summarized as a modular exponentiation operation, and the computation operation of a modular exponentiation is about O(|n|) times that of a modular multiplication computation in Zn*, the computation time consumed by hashing operations, symmetric encryptions or decryptions can be neglected [16]. And symmetric cryptosystem is faster 1000 times than asymmetric cryptosystem and hash function is faster 10 times than symmetric cryptosystem [17]. 
Even if liaw X  X  protocol excludes all the computation operations of bank party, it is still more inefficient than Chang X  X  protocol. Obviously, the proposed protocol is more efficient than Chang X  X  protocol and Liaw X  X  protocol in total. PKE: Public Key Encryption; PKD: Public Key Decryption; SKE: Symmetric Key Encryption; SKD: Symmetric key decryption; 
HF: Hash Function; ME: Modular Exponentiation; R: generate a random number marketplace bidding auction prot ocol relieves DOS attack on market to some extent, protects supplier anonymity, provides sealed bid with independent private values and avoids collusion among parties. Also it satisfies the security requirements of an elec-tronic auction, such as anonymity, non-repudiation, verifiability etc. And the proposed scheme relaxes some trust assumptions for three-party in Jaiswal X  X  scheme. According to the discussion and analysis with Chang et al. X  X  protocol and Liaw et al. X  X  protocol, Therefore, the advantages of our proposed bidding auction protocol are that collusion will be difficult and computation cost is low.
