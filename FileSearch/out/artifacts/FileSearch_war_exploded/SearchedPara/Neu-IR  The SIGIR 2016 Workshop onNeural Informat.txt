In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded sig-nificant performance improvements on speech recognition and computer vision tasks [4, 7], as well as led to exciting breakthroughs in novel application areas such as automatic voice translation [8 ], image captioning [ 2, 12 ], and conversa-tional agents [ 11 ]. Despite demonstrating good performance on natural language processing (NLP) tasks (e.g., language modelling [ 6] and machine translation [1]), the performance of deep neural networks on information retrieval (IR) tasks has had relatively less scrutiny. Recent work in this area has mainly focused on word embeddings [3, 9, 14 ] and neu-ral models for short text similarity [5 , 10 ].

The lack of many positive results in this area of informa-tion retrieval is partially due to the fact that IR tasks such as ranking are fundamentally different from NLP tasks, but also because the IR and neural network communities are only beginning to focus on the application of these tech-niques to core information retrieval problems. Given that deep learning has made such a big impact, first on speech processing and computer vision and now, increasingly, also on computational linguistics, it seems clear that deep learn-ing will have a major impact on information retrieval and that this is an ideal time for a workshop in this area.
Neu-IR (pronounced  X  new IR  X ) will be a forum for new research relating to deep learning and other neural network based approaches to IR. The purpose is to provide an oppor-tunity for people to present new work and early results, com-pare notes on neural network toolkits, share best practices, and discuss the main challenges facing this line of research.
Neu-IR will be a highly interactive full day workshop, fea-turing a mix of presentation and interaction formats, appro-priate for the main themes identified in  X  2. The workshop will feature presentations of the following types: Nick Craswell is a Principal Lead Researcher in Microsoft Bing, working on core relevance. And leads a small team of Applied Researchers who are embedded in Microsoft Re-search Cambridge in the UK. He has published a number of papers relating to clicks and their use, and he ran the first successful WSDM workshop on Web Search Click data in 2009, and co-organized WSCD workshops in 2012 and 2013. Bruce Croft is a Distinguished Professor in the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He leads the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval, which has produced results in many areas of IR for the past 25 years.
 Jiafeng Guo is an Associate Professor at Institute of Com-puting Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He has worked on a number of topics related to Web search and data mining, including query representation and understanding, learning to rank, and topic modelling. His current research is focused on representation learning and deep models for information retrieval and information filtering.
 Bhaskar Mitra is a Senior Applied Scientist at Bing in Microsoft Research Cambridge. He started at Bing in 2007 (then called Live Search) at the Search Technology Center in India. He is currently pursuing a (part-time) doctorate at University College London. His research interests include representation learning and neural networks, and in partic-ular their application to modern day information retrieval. Maarten de Rijke is a Professor of Computer Science at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam. Together with a team of PhD students and postdocs he works on problems on semantic search and on-and offline learning to rank for information retrieval. Some of their re-cent work uses deep neural networks for text similarity, en-tity search, product search, session analysis, and click mod-elling.
