GA is known as  X  X n understanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for your own activity X  [8]. Research has shown that some degree of GA is necessary for all collaborative work, and supporting GA is an essential requirement of groupware sys-though the current awareness mechanisms have enriched GA significantly, many aspects of GA have not been supported or have been supported but at an insufficient level . 
One of the reasons for that lack of success is the gap between current frameworks and of designing mechanisms. We argue that the weak cohesion between current GA frame-works and the design of awareness mechanisms is due to the limitation of current infor-descriptions of the requirements of awareness mechanisms.

The latter describes some fundamental time-related properties of report F@ by describing the abstract and concrete levels. Next, we discuss the use of F@ in designing awareness mechanisms . We observe two major research activities on GA from the literature. The first activity strongly support one another. However, at the moment the cohesion between them is and transform to design solutions to a certain degree. change of a shared workspace [14]. Due to the flexibility of group collaboration, pre-frameworks of GA. Here, we examine two significant frameworks of group awareness developed by Rodden [21], and Gutwin and Greenberg [14].

However, the downside of informal methods translating informal descriptions of GA into designing awareness mechanisms is dif-ficult. We argue that using appropriate formal methods in presenting GA can be use-ful in designing awareness mechanisms.

TL is pow-Drawing on the usefulness of TL, we believe that TL can be useful in describing GA.

Whilst the abstract presence awareness of people in a group . 3.1 Abstract Level of F@ Based on the model of virtual teams [18] and coordination theory [17], we identify three components of group col-laboration: People , Purpose , and Shared Workspace . Peo-ple represent members of a group. For the purpose of modelling GA, we divide People into multiple Person components. This separation is important as it allows us to Shared Workspace is a shared virtual environment in which a group collaborates [14]. 
Given the three group components, we identify four awareness schools of conver-information about the presence of people in the workspace, properties of artefacts in the workspace, people X  X  activity, etc.).

We define that a person is part of a group, i.e., part-of(p, Group) which means that joins or leaves a group. M ( s i ,  X  ) | = join ( p , Group )  X  M ( s i ,  X  ) | = leave ( p , Group )  X 
A person can join and leave a group many times during the collaboration, but can-not leave a group if the person has never joined the group. r  X  R , we say task t is a function: t : g  X  r . Person p has a goal at node s M ( s i ,  X  ) | = has ( p , goal )  X 
We now model the four awareness schools using TL. Due to space limits, we can-not describe all properties of the awareness schools, instead we focus on some impor-tant aspects of each awareness school. Conversational Awareness Conversational awareness corresponds to co mmunication process which involves four tion can be modelled as: M ( s,  X  ) | = inform ( Sender, Receiver, Message ). 
When a sender sends a message to a recei ver, the following awareness conditions need to hold: 
A sender needs to be aware that the sender informs a receiver of a message. 
A sender needs to be aware that the receiver actually receives a message. means that the receiver knows who the sender is and what the message is. Workspace Awareness Workspace awareness corresponds to the pro cess of maintaining users X  perception of other people and objects in a shared workspace. To show how TL is useful in model-ling workspace awareness, we focus on three important aspects of workspace aware-ness: presence awareness of people, awareness of objects, and awareness of people X  X  activities . a) Presence Awareness of People and future members (i.e., who are going to join a group).

A goal refers to a state that users aim to achieve that can be a common goal or individual goal. The literature shows that goals held by a group can be considered by all members of a group. Common goals are decomposed into many sub-goals. The bottom of the hierarchy consists of operational goals that can be achieved by individ-ual actions. 
In our research, we assume that when users want to achieve a goal, they are aware Self-awareness aspect of awareness, i.e., those awareness schools examine what information needs to ness aspect of awareness, which we refer to as self-awareness. three awareness schools. Based on the information provided by conversational aware-aware of fact  X  at state s : M ( s,  X  ) | = aware ( user,  X  ) aware of that he/she is aware of  X  . Thus, we have: aware ( user,  X  ) aware ( user, aware(user,  X  )) awareness. We assume that a user is aware of the user X  X  own goal, and also aware of common goal with the other user. 4.1 Applying F@ in Instant Messaging Here, we illustrate how F@ was used in designing mechanisms to support conversa-tional awareness, workspace awareness, and contextual awareness in Instant Messag-ing (IM). Conversational Awa reness Mechanisms often hold: aware ( Sender, receive ( Receiver, Message )) (ca.2) aware ( Receiver, inform ( Sender, Receiver, Message )) (ca.3) 
Through verbal and non-verbal cues, people are aware of to whom they are talking, and whether the listeners can hear them. However, these conditions often do not hold in computer mediated communication tools such as IM systems. 
In general, IM meets (ca.1) and (ca.3) by providing visual cues such as  X  X ho is typing X  in the case of text-based conversation, and a coloured bar that raises in the case of audio conversation to inform a sender and a receiver that the sender is sending a message. But, that is often only supported for the case of one-to-one con-versations. When a conversation involves a group of more than two people, these two conditions often do not hold. For example, when two people are typing at the same time, IM does not indicate who they are; or when two people are talking at the same time, there is no visual indicator showing who is talking. Based on the formula addressed in F@, we have developed an IM client that features visual cues indicating many people are concurrently typing in a conversation. Fig. 2 shows the scenario of three users, i.e. Pete, Jane and Kate, composing messages simultaneously. 
Current IM systems fail to meet (ca.2). That is, a sender does not know whether a receiver actually re-ceives the message. Hence, in many cases, a sender needs to ask the receiver for confirmation (i.e., if the receiver actually receives the message). We suggest that IM systems can be improved by distinguishing the cases when a message is delivered to a receiver successfully and when a message does not reach an intended receiver. IM systems can provide aware-messages. suggest that IM systems can include awareness mechanisms such as Track View [26] auditory track and who else is currently viewing the user X  X  webcam (Fig. 3). We are addressed in (ca.2), but rather show an example of how F@ can be used in the design of awareness mechanisms. Workspace Awareness Mechanisms Supporting presence awareness of other people is one important aspect of workspace conversation: 
To date, IM systems show only a list of active users who are currently in a group (i.e., pa.2) and do not show information about users who either were in a group (i.e., pa.1) or who are going to join the group (i.e., pa.3). 
Drawing on these conditions, Buddy View is an awareness mechanism in our IM sants of an IM conversation are shown. Fig. 2 illustrates an example of three current users X  X ete, Jane and Kate X  X ho are currently participating in a discussion, and one the current users have been in a discussion and how long ago past users had left the discussion. 
Supporting presence awareness of coming users who are going to join a discussion has not yet been implemented in Buddy View, but that is very straightforward and can designing awareness mechanisms. Contextual Awareness Mechanisms Conventional IM systems display all messages in a linear order which has been found highly limited in building context of a group conversation [22]. Contextual awareness sages (i.e., messages are sequentially displayed one after another). As a result, it makes it diffi-cult to connect coherently between questions and answers, and between two consecutive messages of the same person. Often, the users copy-and-paste the contents of the previous message into their currently composed mes-sages in order to link two messages together. This issue becomes problematic when the tween actions and a directed goal: where t p is task, g p is goal, and r p is result. 
Interpreting this formula, we have adopted a tree layout in our IM system to enrich contextual awareness of a conversation. As shown in Fig. 4, by using the tree layout, users can post a question directly to a particular question. 4.2 Applying F@ in Collaborative Writing Now, we show how F@ was used in the design of awareness mechanisms to support workspace awareness and self-awareness for a collaborative writing system, CoWord [23] . Workspace Awareness Mechanisms positions of all artefacts in the workspace [15]. But F@ addresses the issue of provid-ing current and previous positions of artefacts: aware ( user, position-of-object )  X  (  X  x ) position ( obj, x )  X  know ( user, x ) 
To facilitate users X  awareness of artefacts, after showing artefacts X  current locations in a shared workspace, it is also important for groupware to visually display the pre-vious positions of artefacts. An ex-ample of such a visualisation technique is a local replay technique proposed in MLB [28]. 
Popular awareness mechanisms like radar views and multi-user scrollbars often show where users are currently viewing, and fail to distinguish between users X  viewing and working areas. F@ indicates that groupware at which activities occur: mented Extended Radar View [27], which supports awareness in collaborative writing by providing authors with simultaneous views of other people X  X  working and viewing areas in a shared document (Fig. 5). Self-awareness Mechanisms awareness schools. For example, if a user knows that his/her goal is the same as an-other person X  X  goal, then the user knows that two people share the common goal, and need to work together closely: 
This TL formula is applicable in de-signing awareness mechanisms for collaborative writing systems. For ex-ample, collaborative editors can include a list of authors X  tasks such as Dynamic Task List (DTL) [25]. DTL shows tasks for which each author is responsible, and is dynamically updated whenever new tasks are assigned to authors. In the scenario illustrated in Fig. 6, DTL shows a scenario in which Peter, Tom and Jim share a common goal of writ-ing  X  X hapter 3 X . synchronous distributed groupware X  X hich aims to provide a better understanding of GA, and to assist groupware designers in developing mechanisms for GA.
