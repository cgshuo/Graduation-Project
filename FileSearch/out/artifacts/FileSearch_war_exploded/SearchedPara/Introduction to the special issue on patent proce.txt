 1. Introduction
The processing of intellectual property documents, such as patents, has been important to the industry, business, and law communities. Recently, the importance of patent processing has also been recognized in aca-demic research communities, particularly by information retrieval and natural language processing research-ers. Workshops on patent processing were held at ACM SIGIR 2000 and ACL 2003. The NTCIR Workshop, which is a Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)-style evaluation forum, has been organizing the Patent Retrie-val Task since 2001.

For the NTCIR Workshop, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of patent retrieval and classification, test collections including Japanese patent applications over 10 years (approximately 3,500,000 documents) were produced. They are publicly available for research purposes. ers to systematically evaluate their methodologies from a scientific point of view.
In the light of these activities, this special issue collects advanced research papers on patent processing in
In the call for papers for this special issue, authors who intended to submit a paper already presented at an international conference or workshop were encouraged to enhance its content; e.g., by combining more than cussing related work.

The editors of the special issue, who are also the authors of this paper, are the three Japanese researchers co-organizing the Patent Retrieval Task in the NTCIR Workshop. To form an international editorial group, the program committee, which comprises three researchers in different parts of the world (Donna Harman,
Mun-Kew Leong, and Elizabeth D. Liddy), collaborated with the special issue editors in the paper-selection process. During this process, anonymous reviewers also assessed the submitted papers.
 Section 2 of this paper surveys the literature related to patent processing, on a topic-by-topic basis, and
Section 3 outlines the papers selected for the special issue. 2. A brief survey of patent processing 2.1. Information retrieval
Processes of patent retrieval differ significantly, depending on the purpose of retrieval. One process is the searched. This process is similar to ad hoc retrieval tasks targeting nonpatent documents.
Away from academic research, invalidity searches are performed by examiners in government patent offices and searchers in the intellectual property divisions of private companies.

The use of patents in information retrieval research dates back at least to the 1970s ( Attar &amp; Fraenkel, 1977 ), when 76 US patents were used to evaluate the effectiveness of local feedback techniques. The experi-ment in this research simulated the technology survey task, in which seven queries, such as  X  X  X lectrode struc-ture X  X , were used. For each query, an electronics engineer selected relevant patents from the 76 US patents.
Osborn and Strzalkowski (1997) performed experiments on the invalidity search task. They used approxi-mately 6000 US patents as a target document collection. Each search topic was also a patent, and the patents cited in the topic patent were used as relevant documents, because cited patents are usually prior arts for a citing patent. Therefore, no relevance judgment by human experts was needed.

For the Third NTCIR Workshop (NTCIR-3), a test collection for the technology survey task was produced a newspaper clipping related to a specific technology, and the document collection comprised Japanese patent articles and patent applications. At NTCIR-3, Itoh, Mano, and Ogawa (2003) improved the effectiveness of the
For NTCIR-4 and NTCIR-5, two test collections for the invalidity search task were produced. Each search topic was a claim in a patent application rejected by the Japanese Patent Office (JPO). The document collec-tions at NTCIR-4 and NTCIR-5 comprised Japanese patent applications over five and 10 years, respectively.
At NTCIR-4, for each topic, the citations provided by JPO examiners and patents searched by human experts were used as relevant documents ( Fujii, Iwayama, &amp; Kando, 2004 ). At NTCIR-5, only the citations provided by JPO examiners were used as relevant documents ( Fujii, Iwayama, &amp; Kando, 2006 ).
 evant patent. Therefore, for NTCIR-5, a test collection for evaluating passage retrieval was also produced. In
This concept provides a salient contrast to the conventional evaluation method, in which all relevant items (documents or passages) are independently important, and combinations of relevant items are not considered.
At NTCIR-4 and NTCIR-5, Mase, Matsubayashi, and Ogawa (2005) proposed a two-stage retrieval method and achieved a relatively high performance. Takaki, Fujii, and Ishikawa (2004) analyzed claim struc-tures to improve the effectiveness of the invalidity search task. 2.2. Classification their interests. While classification by human experts is expensive and subjective, automatic methods are expected to alleviate this problem.

Once a patent application is submitted to a government patent office, the application is usually assigned to one or more classification codes by human experts according to an existing patent classification system, such rect answers in evaluating the effectiveness of automatic classification methods.
 Larkey (1999) proposed a system for retrieving and classifying patents, using the US Patent and Trademark different classification methods using the WIPO-alpha collection, which comprises patent applications submit-ted to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Koster and ents submitted to the European Patent Office.

For NTCIR-5, a test collection for the patent classification was produced. In this collection, target docu-ments are patent applications submitted to the JPO over two years, and the correct classification codes are determined according to a multidimensional classification system called  X  X  X -term X  X  ( Schellner, 2002 ). F-term includes approximately 2500 themes, covering all the technological fields for patents. The patents classified into each theme are further classified into viewpoints, such as  X  X  X urpose X  X ,  X  X  X unction X  X , and  X  X  X ffect X  X . 2.3. Interpatent analysis
Because patents are often related to each other, knowledge that cannot be found by looking at a single pat-ent alone can potentially be discovered by analyzing interpatent relations.

One type of relation among patents is determined by citations, for which traditional research in citation This idea is similar to identifying authoritative pages by analyzing hyperlink structures on the World Wide
Web. In another example, because two patents related to the same invention tend to cite the same patent and are cited by the same patent, interpatent similarity can be determined by cocitation analysis.
Using patent citation analysis, Narin, Carpenter, and Woolf (1984) evaluated corporate technological per-formance, and Chakrabarti, Dror, and Eakabuse (1993) analyzed the diffusion of technological information among different organizations. Lai and Wu (2005) used citation-based interpatent similarity to perform a pat-ent classification.

Another type of relation among patents is determined by word co-occurrences in patents, because word dis-tributions tend to be similar among patents for a similar invention. Engelsman and van Raan (1994) performed a coword analysis to compute the relational strength between technical fields, and produced patent maps.
At NTCIR-4, a patent-map generation task, in which human experts subjectively assessed the patent maps generated by automatic methods, was performed. However, a reusable test collection and a systematic eval-uation method have not been established. Compared with information retrieval and classification, the system-atic evaluation of interpatent analysis is inherently difficult. This issue should be further explored. 2.4. Natural language processing
Among the several structure fields in a patent, the patent claim is the subject of legal protection. Thus, the processing of patent claims is important from a legal point of view. Because patent claims are described in a patent-specific sublanguage, a number of methods for analyzing and generating patent claims have been pro-posed in the natural language processing community.

Shinmori, Okumura, Marukawa, and Iwayama (2003) aimed to improve the readability of patent claims, particularly for nonexperts, and proposed a method for analyzing the rhetorical structure of patent claims.
Sheremetyeva, Nirenburg, and Nirenburg (1996) proposed a natural language generation method to help users produce patent claims.

Given the growing number of patents filed in multiple countries, it is likely that users will be interested in collecting patents across languages. To overcome language barriers, machine translation of patents ( Cavalier, 2001 ) and cross-language patent retrieval ( Higuchi, Fukui, Fujii, &amp; Ishikawa, 2001 ) are crucial.
Patent documents are usually lengthy, so patent summarization is an effective method for obtaining the contents of patents at minimal cost. Because patents usually include abstracts of their contents that can be used as exemplar summaries, existing supervised methods for summarization ( Mani, 2001 ) can potentially be applied to patents. 3.
