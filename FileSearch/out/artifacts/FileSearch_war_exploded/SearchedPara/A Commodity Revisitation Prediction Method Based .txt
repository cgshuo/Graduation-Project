 In the 21st century, with the advent of the Internet age, it has subtly changed our way of production and consumption. Online shopping as a new consumer behavior has a great impact on people X  X  way of life, behavior and consumption patterns. At the same time, with the development of material and culture society, online shopping consumption has gradually become an important part of the consumption of our residents. So we research the consumer X  X  short-term revisitation behavior is very important for attracting and maintaining customers [1, 5].
 ever, some of one X  X  behaviors for each individual have shown some certain regularities and repeatability at a certain time and under the background of the social environment [17, 18, 12]. Such as people X  X  work and rest time, if a person having a regular routine for a long time, so virtually will form a biological clock. Biological clock is repeated the schedule of human behavior, according to the biological clock can predict what people do in the same environment and specific time. Consumer X  X  online shopping behaviors also have a certain regularity and can predict the short-term revisitation behaviors. The data source includes a detailed record on the Tmall to visit commodities within six months. Each consumer X  X  visitation history records at every time that contains some basic features, such as the user ID, commodity category ID, brand ID and the visitation time. The information of these properties include the side of consumer, commodity, as well as the side of consumers and commodity interact with each other.
 in the following three aspects: (1) It can help the platform of shopping to identify po-tential customers, for customers to do personal recommendation, attract consumers. So as to it can improve the profitability of enterprises, reduce the cost of capital takes up, and at the same time improve their own brand. (2) By analyzing the behavior of con-sumers of goods, can promote the improvement of service quality and improve service levels. It is beneficial to improve enterprise X  X  brand image and reputation and to further promote the healthy development of the enterprise. (3) Enterprise through consumer-s X  visit records of consumption that can perfect oneself, improve service level, improve the quality of goods, safeguard the rights and interests of consumers better. Furthermore it can encouraged consumer enthusiasm and desire for purchase, and also play a very impartment role in stimulating domestic demand.
 marketing gradually embarked on the stage of history, rapid development of online shopping market and trading volume has been increasing rapidly. The regularity and reliability of online trading platform are particularly important. Therefore, the study of short-term revisitation prediction are facing the following challenges: (1) the short-term revisitation behavior is dynamic, it is difficult to describe its dynamics through simulation model. (2) The short-term revisitation behavior is random and it is easily affected by the outside factors. (3) It is difficult to extract the features of the general to represent the user X  X  revisitation behavior. (4) Because of the lack of source control, it lead to all sorts of dirty data, such as fake shopping, this kind of dirty data accumulated to a certain degree will influence the accuracy of the prediction.
 havior, including commodity popularity, commodity revisitation ratio, user revisitation ratio and brand popularity. Based on the five characteristics, the improved fuzzy com-prehensive evaluation method FCEM-II [20, 19] can predict the customers X  short-term revisitation behaviors. The prediction results as an important basis for the identification of potential and loyal customers to help with shopping trading platform.
  X  We use the history of consumers to shop on the site to analyze and extract factors  X  The problem of short-term revisitation prediction, i.e. whether or not a consumer  X  The experimental results showed that the proposed methods demonstrated promis-research work in prediction on revisitation behaviors of commodity. In Section 3, we propose binary short-term revisitation behavior prediction. Section 4 introduces the ex-perimental results and analysis. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 5. In life, the internet has gradually become an integral part of people X  X  lives, and the on-line shopping this new way of shopping has become the social mainstream consumption patterns. At present, the online shopping platform is mainly concerned with the analysis of consumers X  psychology and predicting consumer behavior. However, the prediction of consumer behavior is not mature in a certain time and context, and there is no conve-nient and reliable theoretical system. Based on the existing literature, we learn from the experience and study consumer short-term revisitation behavior. We introduced several studies on people X  X  revisitation behaviors in this section.  X  Research of consumers repeated visitation behavior.

However, in this paper, we predict whether a user will revisitated commodity at a specific time ,according to the above browse and buy records. We can recommend to the user with the more appropriate commodity and make the shopping website management more intelligent, provides the necessary reference for the decision maker X  X  decision. It can reduce the operating costs of the web site greatly, improve the management efficiency significantly, and promote the increase in the volume of transactions.
 ty popularity, commodity revisitation ratio, user revisitation ratio, window repeat ratio and brand popularity. We applicated the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. On the basis of relevant theories and the existing research results, with visitation records of consumer goods in the ecommerce platform of digital records as the background, inte-grated prediction method, we can predict whether consumers will have the revisitation behaviors in the short term. On the whole, there are several basic concepts in our work: The u on behalf of the visitation history of user that is made up of a sequence of the visitation transactions, T u = { t u 1 , t u 2 , . . . , t u | T tains the k most recent visitation of a user till now. Once the user issues a new trans-action or visited a new goods t on an arbitrary commodity, t is pushed into the tail of W k . For the meantime, if the number of transactions in surpass the limit k, the head transaction of W k is taked out.
 on the use of sliding window, we can formally define the short-term revisitation behav-iors.
 itation commodity t , we call it a short-term revisitation behavior, if t  X  W k . Otherwise, t is considered as a novel visitation.
 revisitation behavior is influenced by the setting of k. To inquire people X  X  short-term revisitation behaviors, k is often not too large so that only the repetitions on the recent visitations are considered. Therefore, we enact the problem of the binary prediction of short-term revisitation behaviors as below: forming visitation commodity t , the problem of the binary prediction of short-term revisitation behaviors is to predict whether or not t  X  W u,t k where t is unknownfor. the elapsed time because the continuity makes the time bound hard to determine in real-world scenarios, and the k-last-visited commodity are representative enough for people X  X  (re)visitation contexts. In this section, we introduced the five common features in detail firstly which influence the consumers X  revisitation behaviors in the short term, and on the basis of it, using the improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to predict consumers X  revisitation behavior. 3.1 Feature Extraction In order to simulate and predict the willing of the consumers X  revisitation behavior, we propose the following features: (1) commodity popularity (2) commodity revisitation ratio (3) user revisitation ratio (4) window repeat ratio (5) brand popularity. These fea-tures correspond to the three major aspects regarding short-term revisitation behaviors, i.e. commodity aspect (1-2), user aspect (3) and interactional aspect (4).
 Commodity Popularity The consumers X  revisitation behavior is impact by the com-modity popularity, and as well as has a very important influence. As is known to all that the high commodity popularity are usually much more likely to be revisitation. Com-modity frequency (abbr. IP) is an ideal measurement of the popularit of each commod-ity. In the given data set, we defined the to be the commodity frequency x. The fraction of the maximum commodity frequency in the data set is the commodity popularity x which we measured.
 The fraction of the maximum commodity frequency in the data set is the commodity popularity x which we measured. Where X is the commodities set. The log operator is used to adjust the skewed distri-bution of commodity popularity. We used the average popularity to represent the given sliding window : By analyzing the relationship between and people X  X  revisitation aspiration, we find that along with the increases of the probability of revisitation, the average commodity pop-ularity of sliding window also increases. Commodity Revisitation Ratio The intrinsic factors is another way to influence con-sumers X  revisitation behavior in the short term, it is a straight forward intuition that the different commodity revisitation ratios also lead to different probabilities to perform revisitation. The absolute commodity revisitation ratio is defined as its probability to be observed as a revisitation along the user visitation sequences, Where U is the user set, T u is the visitation sequence of user for six month, 1 cond is the indicator function which returns 1 when cond is satisfied, and or else returns 0. The value of the absolute commodity revisitation ratio is similar to the definition of the commodity popularity, and it is also adjusted by a log operator.
 the maximum absolute commodity revisitation ratio, We use the average commodity revisitation ratio (abbr. IRR) of a sliding window as another metric, User Revisitation Ratio The user preference plays a very important role in people X  X  behaviors, and it is usually that different people have different preferences and habits. The user factor is absolutely an important signal in analyzing people X  X  short-term visi-tation behaviors. For example, many people have brand loyalty and repurchase on a few brands frequently.
 aspects. We use the user X  X  simple and direct features as the influencing factors of user behavior. i.e., user revisitation ratio, to analyze how short-term revalidation behaviors can be affected by different user personalities and preferences. The ratio is defined as the probability that a user performs a revisitation along her visitation transaction sequence, Window Repeat Ratio On the basis of considering project and user factors, we also discussed the other factors that which may be affect the consumers X  revisitation behav-ior in the short time. Given a k-length sliding window W k , we would like to know in the next step whether the total number of revisitation times in W k will influences people X  X  revisitation behavior. This function is based on the assumption that consumers may be satisfied with the commodity in several times, though they can revisitation it in many times, or on the contrary. The compact revisitation made the probability increased to perform another revisitation again like the Mathew Effect in people X  X  short-term revisi-tation behaviors.
 We use the proportion of the revisitation in the current sliding window to measure the window repeat ratio (abbr. WRR), It is obvious that 0 &lt; h W RR ( W k ) &lt; 1 .
 Brand Popularity The consumers X  behavior of revisitation is impact by the quality of brand, and as well as has a very important influence. As is known to all that the high quality brands are usually much more likely to be revisitation. Brand popularity (abbr. IP) is an ideal measurement of the quality of each brand.
 fraction of the maximum commodity frequency in the data set is the popularity of brand x which we measured. Where X is the brand set. The log operator is used to adjust the skewed distribution of brand popularity. We used the average popularity to represent the given sliding window W 3.2 Fast Prediction Methods In this paper, we try to combine all the five common features to predict people X  X  revisita-tion behavior. Given the k-length sliding window W u,t k of user u right before performing visitation commodity t, we construct a vector: x u,t combining all the factors mentioned above together. Next, we propose an improved fuzzy compre-hensive evaluation method to predict the short-term revisitation behavior. fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method has been proved to an efficient approach to solving classification problem. Based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method we propose a modified algorithm FCEM-II to solve the prediction on short-term commod-ity revisitation behaviors problem.
 determine short-term commodity revisitation behaviors, such as commodity, users and the mutual influence between them. All of these features constitute a set of evaluation index systems, namely the factor set, remember to result set contains two elements: it is a revisitation behavior, not a revisitation behavior. The two elements constitute the result set, remember to (3)Determining the weight of each factor. Under normal circumstances, the concen-tration of various factors in comprehensive evaluation is different, the comprehensive evaluation result is not only related to the evaluation of various factors, and also to a large extent depends on the role of various factors on the comprehensive evaluation, which requires determining the weight distribution between the various factors, it is the fuzzy vector, remember to Among them: a i for the weight of the i-th factor, and meet the P 5 i =1 a i = 1 . There are many ways to determine the weights, such as: the Delphi method, the crowd assessment method, the weighted average method.
 workflow of Delphi method is shown in Fig.1.
 remember The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix of each index is It is a fuzzy comprehensive judgment matrix from U to R.
 the use of can get a fuzzy transformation.
 By this transformation, the comprehensive evaluation results can be obtained. (6)Single feature impact. We believe that if the value of a particular feature is partic-ularly large, then the probability of short-term visitation is very large. Therefore, we analyze the features of each feature separately, in the form of influencing factors added to the comprehensive evaluation results of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, 4.1 Data Sets We use Tmall X  X  data for 6 months to carry out the experiment, the large-scale reliable data source provides a beneficial basis in predicting the customers X  short-term revisi-tation behaviors. Tmall is a comprehensive shopping site that integrates thousands of brands and manufacturers, to provide first-class solutions for businesses and consumers. Tmall has a large visitation of a large number of customers and the goods. Consumers often visit the goods on the Tmall, and repeatedly visit the same goods. The statistics of this data set is shown in Table 1. 4.2 Experimental Settings we use the linear method and our improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method FCEM-II for comparison.
 feature space. Linear method is the state-of-the-art classifiers and it is quite suitable to compare with our method. 4.3 Short-Term Revisitation Behavior Prediction According to the Definition 4, whether a new visiter belongs to the short-term behavior is related to the length of the window. Windows of different lengths lead to different definitions of short-term revisitation behavior as well as different ground truth in our evaluations on the same data sets. Thus, we firstly compared these prediction methods under the same setting of window length.
 behavior results when the window length k=10. TP, TN, FN and FP represent True-Positive, True-Negative, False-Negative and False-Positive, respectively. Thus, the val-tify the revisitation behaviors and the novel visitation behaviors, respectively. Further-set and their performance is stable and promising. FCEM-II has the highest prediction accuracy 0.625 in Tmall set. By contrast, our methods could balance the prediction results better.
 4.4 Impacts of Window Length Whether the new visitation behavior belongs to the visitation behavior is influenced by the length of the window, according to the definition (4). Fig.2 shows the overal-l revisitation rate for different window lengths for Tmall. The changes of short-term revisitation behavior ratio of Tmall is not smooth as the window length increases. In contrast, the short-term revisitation rate of Tmall increases quickly from 0.37 (k=5) to 0.44 (k=25). It means that most people often revisit goods that are far from now. settings of window length of Tmall is illustrated in Fig.3. Can see that FCEM-II has a similar trend with the linear method. But our method has higher accuracy in predicting short-term revisitation behavior. With the increase of the window length, the accuracy of the improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is not very large. In the online consumption environment, loyal customer choice issue has been taken as a pressing task in the literature.
 modity in a short-term. According to the revisitation history of consumers in online shopping platform, five common features were extracted, value of which were analyzed by improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Based on the analytic results, we predicted the consumers X  revisitation behavior in the short term. Comparing the pre-dicted results with the actual behavior of the consumers, the accuracy of our prediction method was obtained, which showed that our method was efficient and stable. In the future, our research focus will go deep into studying correlation degree between the commodities that consumers visit, the personalized recommendation service and infor-mation re-finding.
