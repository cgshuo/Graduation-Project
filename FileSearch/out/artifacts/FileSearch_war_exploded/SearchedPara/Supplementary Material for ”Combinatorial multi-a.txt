 We use the following two well known bounds in our proofs.

 We write as least where  X  i, 1 is for the initialization.
 More specifically, we have the following claim.
 Claim 1. For any time horizon n &gt; m , Proof. By the definition of N l,suf i,n , it is sufficient to show that for any n  X  t &gt; m ,  X  time t , we have the following properties: So we have ` index l satisfies S t = S l i, B .

Then the regret bound is of a second order ln ln n term as in (Garivier &amp; Capp  X e, 2011), with regret at most smoothness function f ( x ) =  X   X  x  X  for some  X  &gt; 0 and  X   X  (0 , 1] , the regret of CUCB is at most: distribution-independent regret bound. The rough idea is, if  X  i min  X  1 / time horizon n .
 arguments will be still applicable under any condition.
 For an arm in { i |  X  i min &gt; 0 } , we have E [ X Following the same counting steps as in Eq.(28), we have counter cannot go beyond n i , we have E [ X Therefore, Eq.(29) holds in both cases. We then have n , we can drop the conditional expectation above. The result then follows from Claim 1 and Eq.(18). show how to take advantage of such arm clusters to further improve the regret analysis. in S will be revealed.

If round t is bad, let C = argmin C  X  g ( S By definition N C,t  X  T C,t . The total number of bad rounds in the first n rounds is P C N C,n . into more counters as follows: N call the bad arm S l C,B is sufficiently sampled. Otherwise, it is under-sampled. We write as at least it should not be played in the first place. More specifically, we have the following claim. Claim 2. For any time horizon n &gt; m , Proof. By the definition of N l,suf C,n , it is sufficient to show that for any t &gt; m ,  X  So we have In other words,

 Recall that the definition of  X  min is We have: By Bernstein inequality in Lemma 2, when n &gt;  X  3 , we have times. So, Pr[ P t = 0]  X  mt  X  c . Set ` t = ( c +1) ln t T i,t  X  N i,t  X   X  ln t + 1 &gt; ` t .

We claim that properties: These above inequalities imply that when E t holds, we have With 2 f ( X ) =  X  min , Eq. (38) is in conflict with the definition of  X  min in Eq. (35). In other words, Thus, That means, the regret is at most:
