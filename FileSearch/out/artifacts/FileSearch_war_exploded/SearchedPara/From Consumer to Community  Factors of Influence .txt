 The impacts of online collaboration and networking among consumers on social media (SM) websites which are featuring user generated content in a form of product reviews, ratings and recommendations (PRRR) as an emerging information source is the focus of this research. The proliferation of websites where consumers are able to post the PRRR and share them with other consumers has altered the marketing environment in which companies, marketers and advertisers operate. This cross-sectional study explored consumers X  attitudes and behaviour toward various information sources (IS) , used in the information search phase of the purchasing decision-making process. The study wa s conducted among 300 international consumers. The results were showing that personal and public IS were far more reliable than commercial. The findings indicate that traditional marketing tools are no longer viable in the SM milieu.

Consumers are extensively using various information sources (IS) to become informed about products or services when contemplating a purchase. IS are categoris ed as personal, commercial and public (Hollensen, 2003), they have different importan ce and power to influence consumers X  opinions throughout the purchasing decision making process. Due to SM expansion and proliferation of websites supporting social networking activities, the number of IS (Kuruzovich et al., 2008) has considerably increased. While many companies have already included, or are considering inclusion of SM into their marketing mix, marketers are struggling to evaluate the impact of SM and online networking that are enabling consumers to post product reviews online, where they can be read by other potential customers. Consumers X  practices to look beyond commercial IS have significantly extended in to the online environment, where they are able to search for information, ask questions and have products evaluated and rated through social networking practices on websites that feature product reviews (Gligorijevic and Bruns, 2009). The manufacturing companies, retailers, service providers and marketing professionals are using various communication channels when competing for the attention of their potential customers. It is important to understand how social customers use IS, and what perceived reliability and influence they have on the purchasing decision making process (PDMP). This consumer behaviour study examines how reliable consumers perceive various IS, utilize them and collaborate in SM and networking websites. Marketing as a discipline has been under a lot of pressure to deliver new profitable models of advertising in the environment of computer mediated communication. Lately it has been verified by marketing analysts (Ramsey, 2008; Edelman, 2010; Bughin et al., 2008) that advertising is experiencing a very strong migration from mass media to Internet and SM due to lower cost, better profiling and targeting of consumers, accessibility to market niches, and higher return on investment (ROI). Many corporations are becoming aware of advantages of SM while cutting their marketing budgets and investing further into the new web strategies or business models. According to McKenna (2002) today X  X  marketing is a derivate of  X  X wentieth -century mass-production mentality, and it has become something of a pseudopsychological propaganda machine X  (p.5) being very static and completely relying on the broadcasting model. Technological innovations are the  X  X gent of economic and social change X  (p.7) powerful tools in the hands of consumers allowing them to manage broadcasted commercial messages. The  X  X wakening X  process among marketing professionals is changing the paradigm of ad vertising assuming that broadcasted messages are  X  X bsorbed X  and responded to accordingly. The market place is becoming crowded by advertising messages, while for consumers the increase of access capability is only inducing the level of  X  X oise X . The amplified presence of promotional messages in the market place is inevitably leading to higher level of advertising blindness among consumers. However, consumers highly value the recommendation through the WOM, and it is becoming an  X  X ncredibly powerful medium X  ( Bu lter, 2008). Recommendations about products and services from first hand users are often regarded as important IS, and even more appreciated when coming from a friend (Marsden, 2006). PRRR websites are becoming increasingly popular as a new tool in WOM (WOM) marketing campaigns. This cross-sectional study was conducted online, surveying consumers about their use of PRRR in their information search phase of the purchasing decision-making process. The following research questions were developed for this study: -How reliable consumers perceive various IS when considering a purchase? -What is the consumers X  attitude toward the WOM information both offline and online versus the commercial information? The quantitative study among 300 consumers was carried out from September 2011 until March 2012. The study was conducted online, utilising the structured questionnaire, with respondents from Australia (40 percent) and 30 other countries (60 percent), 52.1 percent males and 47.8 percent females respondents, and age groups up to 25 years 18.6 percent, 26 to 35 years 38.5 percent, 36 to 45 years 27.7 percent, 46 to 55 years 8.6 percent and 56 years and above 6.5 percent. The sample was recruited among international consumers invited to participate through e-mailing lists, forums and online a ds on Facebook. The respondents were asked to evaluate the reliability of IS in offline and online environment in twelve categories. The listed IS were: retailers or shop assistants, manufacturers, advertising or infomercials, magazines or news stories, online retailers, automated recommendations, detailed user generated product reviews, friends and family (WOM from someone they kno w) , short users X  product recommendations, professional or experts product reviews, product ratings by users, discussion forums. Consumers reported that during or while considering a purchase they regarded their friends and family (F&amp;F) or a WOM from someone they know to be the most reliable source of information 79.2 percent. Followed by professional blogs and expert product reviews (PR) 74 percent, detailed user generated product reviews (UGPR) 73.6 percent, short product recommendations from users 63.1 percent, product information from manufacturers 63.3 percent, discussion forums 55.8 percent, product ratings by users (stars; +, -) 50.4 percent, retailers or shop assistants X  advice 44.3, information from online retailers 41.5 percent, magazine or news stories 41.2 percent, automated recommendations based on purchasing patterns 23.3 percent, and advertising or infomercials 18.9 percent. Least reliable IS were considered to be advertising or infomercials 42.6 percent, automated recommendations based on purchasing patterns 37.9 percent, retailers or shop assistants X  advice 25.5 percent, product ratings by users (stars; +, -) 20.2 percent, information from online retailers 21.4 percent, discussion forums 18.7 percent, magazine and news stories 16.6 percent, product information from manufacturers 12 percent, professional blogs and expert PR 11 percent, short product recommendations from users 10.4 percent, detailed UG PR 9.3 percent, and F&amp;F 6.4 percent. Respondents considered F&amp;F and experts or professionals that deliver PR and other fellow consumers posting PR to be trustworthy IS. Manufacturers product related information were rated considerably high as reliable, contrary to advertising or infomercials considered as very unreliable indicating that advertising messages are seen to be created by advertisers and not as an integral part of the marketing communication for companies and brands. Further user created content, in a form of PRRR, discussions in forums are noticeably highly evaluated as reliable  X  considerably more than automated product recommendations based on purchasing patterns of other consumers or retailers or shop assistants X  advice. This signifies the trust levels toward reliability of information to be notably higher among fellow consumers than toward the recommendations coming from commercial IS. Additionally, these results signify that consumers perceive private, commercial and public IS as very different. While private IS in the form of WOM from someone they know had the strongest influence on their purchasing decisions as the most reliable, the least reliable advertisements and infomercials that communicate commercial information. Research outcomes stipulate that custome rs don X  X  conform to retailers X  suggestions as strongly as to recommendations from other customers in a form of electronic WOM through UG PRRR or discussions in online forums demonstrating that these SM spaces are becoming crucially important for companies and brands when designing a marketing strategy. Hence WOM information is very influential in the PDMP among current or potential customers and as such should be carefully managed by marketers in the SM space . The results of the study show that WOM is the dominant form of information in both offline and online environments and is the most influential through personal IS (F&amp;F) and public sources (PRRR posted online by other consumers). While commercial IS (advertising and infomercials) are the least influential on consumers in their PDMP. The perception of reliability of IS among survey respondents when searching for information about products is showing consumers X  strong preference toward their personal contacts -F&amp;F or WOM from someone they know. Whereas the online public IS (UG PRRR, and additionall y professional blogs or expe rt PR ) were reported to be highly regarded by consumers as reliable and therefore influential, retailers and shop assistants were considerably less reliable and therefore their influence was not dominant in the PDMP. Hence the marketing strategies that strongly rely on advertising online or offline, or advertising at the  X  X oint of sales X  will have less impact than brand presence in WOM communication. Further we concluded that consumers X  attitudes toward the WOM information are very positive contrary to product information coming from commercial sources. This sentiment was explicitly depicted in survey results, labelling advertising and infomercials and automated recommendations based on purchasing patterns as the least reliable categories followed by information from retailers (offline and online). The consumers have changed their shopping practices from searching online commercial or retailing websites to looking for information from friends, family and peers or by posting PRRR and collaborating in SM spaces. This behavioural change is a strong sign for marketers, suggesting that altering online marketing strategies -from advertising to conversational or WOM marketing may lead to better marketing outcomes.
