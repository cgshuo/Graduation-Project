 1. Introduction
The modern world often associates innovation with technology. Although the creation of innovation might not always involve technology, its adoption likely does. A sculptor could create a new style of art with no involvement of technology and still be regarded as having innovated in the art sphere. Today, however, it is inconceivable that the new style of art would be broadly adopted without the support of technology, especially when it comes to communication, data sharing, opinions, discussions, presentations, and collaboration. Is communication sufficient to ensure successful adoption of an inno-vation through diffusion of opinions and social influence? In comparison to a new style of art, the adoption of technological innovations needs more than just opinions and influence (although these factors still play an important role); an innovation that brings minor improvements to an existing product, a disruptive technological innovation, and a complex theoretical innovation all require various degrees of learning by the adopter.

In this paper, the term innovation refers to disruptive creations that require radical changes in the way things are done. A disruptive innovation always has a small initial footprint and addresses the problems of non-consumers, people who find that mainstream products are not satisfying their needs ( Christensen, Horn, &amp; Johnson, 2008 ). Disruptive innovations con-trast breakthrough improvements, which are sometimes referred to as sustaining innovations. As an example, the iPad ini-tially catered to users who wanted a simple way to enjoy the consumption of content using a light device that could be easily carried. PC manufactures have continuously improved their products but have never addressed this demand in the same way. Apple sold 40 million units in 2011 and was estimated to sell 60 million units next year alone ( Gallagher, 2012 ) posing  X  a serious threat to PC manufacturers. This technology is following the path of disruptive innovation adoption; whereas the initial use of the iPad was informal and casual, the new product is being rapidly adopted in numerous sectors ranging from education to healthcare, the auto industry, and finance and is disrupting the traditional market. In this context, the latest improved version of the laptop, the ultrabook, is the product of a sustaining innovation.

The adoption of innovation causes an initial knowledge gap between the current knowledge and the knowledge needed for using the innovation effectively. Addressing the knowledge gap is an important challenge in the adoption of innovation and it is the key research question of this study. One way to address this issue is to use information systems to find the needed information. Considerable effort has been placed on the development of information systems as an efficient manner to store and manage information and on the design of intelligent interfaces that help users identify and access the necessary resources. The Cognitive Information Retrieval (CIR) theory captures the challenges posed by the need to access the right information for successful problem solving and recognises the importance of understanding the socio-economic context of the user ( Ingwersen &amp; Jarvelin, 2005 ).

Although the CIR theory has contributed significantly to advancements in the field of information retrieval, the theory is limited to analysing ways in which access to information can be improved through better design of information systems.
Despite attempts to connect the realms of systems and users through multidisciplinary concepts such as the polyrepresen-tation continuum, multitasking framework ( Larsen &amp; Ingwersen, 2005 ), and models for information searching and seeking ( Spink &amp; Cole, 2005b ), the theory remains faithful to the original intent, which is to focus on improving the experience of searching for information in library systems. This study discusses the opportunity to build on current CIR work by consid-ering the broader social context in which knowledge is being generated and used.

During the investigation, it became apparent that it was necessary to examine the role of information processing skills in the adoption of innovation. The study extends Brooke X  X  (1980) equation for information science by proposing two symbolic equations that encapsulate the contribution of the social and information systems to addressing the knowledge gap. The equations highlight the fact that innovators and adopters of innovation need to evaluate not only their information/com-puter and professional skills, but also their information/social skills to improve their ability to create knowledge.
The study proposes a model in which the social structures play the role of information sources side-by-side with infor-mation systems. The social structures in the form of social networks are seen as a hybrid formed by fusing together human and technological communication networks into one entity with a significant role in knowledge behaviour and adoption of innovation. 2. Methodology
Building on the previous research on innovation in education ( Badilescu-Buga, 2011 ), the project expands the research literature review to examine the process of addressing the knowledge need as a key component of the adoption of innovation.

The initial research goal of the previous project was to examine the adoption of online learning design tools and to iden-tify ways in which adoption could be accelerated. The study used Rogers X  (2003) theory of diffusion of innovations, Moore X  X  (2002) entrepreneurial perspective on adoption of innovation, and Christensen X  X  ( Christensen et al., 2008 ) work on disrup-tive innovation in education as a theoretical foundation and set of guiding tools to identify adoption patterns shared among teachers from a variety of institutions, education systems and countries.

Although the existing innovation models were useful in helping to understand the statistical trends of adoption, they could not sufficiently explain why adoption would not proceed beyond initial stages for products that received positive feed-back and gained interest from large geographical areas across the globe.

Adding CIR to the theoretical toolset provided a more granular insight into the adoption process and helped narrow the focus of the research question from one that is concerned with the broad challenge of adoption of innovation to one that is concerned with the challenge of addressing the knowledge gap triggered by the innovation.

This study uses a multi-disciplinary approach to integrate theories and concepts relevant to individual aspects of the adoption process to create a unified framework of knowledge behaviour and social adoption of innovation. The outcome of this research involved the evaluation and synthesis of published work in information science and computer science, with special focus on CIR theory.

The research uses an approach which is closer to information and social sciences using inference rules suitable for qual-itative research ( King, Keohane, &amp; Verba, 1994 ): (a) make descriptive or causal inference, (b) explain the observations and inferences rather than relying on implicit assumptions, (c) offer a view on the uncertainty related to the conclusions of this study, and (d) account for the rules and methods used in this research whenever possible.

Section 3 , has two parts: the first is dedicated to examining the information behaviour in the context of adoption of inno-vation, and the second is dedicated to describing the proposed model of social adoption of innovation. To minimise potential ambiguity of the terminology, this chapter begins with a section containing key definitions for the terms used throughout the paper. It is recommended this section is read first before continuing with the rest of the analysis and the discussion that follows in Section 4 .
 3. Analysis and findings 3.1. Information behaviour in the context of adoption of innovation 3.1.1. Key definitions
To create a set of common references necessary to understand the following analysis and discussion, it is appropriate to establish a few working definitions related to factual data, information and knowledge.

The difference between factual data and information is highlighted first. Factual data are the what-is generated by occur-rences that take place in the  X  X  X eal X  X  world: social, economic, cultural, environmental, and physical, etc. Factual data are the equivalent of the Physical World in Popper X  X  ontological scheme of the entire world of knowledge ( Popper, 1972 ). Authors, humans and machines interpret factual data to produce semantic objects in accordance with their goals and store the data into information systems. When semantic objects and factual data are subjected to manipulation and interpretation by users, the understanding of their meaning represents information to the user. Therefore, information is the subjective meaning that is produced through a process of interpretation of the  X  X  X otential information X  X  by a knowledge structure ( Brookes, 1980 ).
Information behaviour is the sum of all activities that are part of the process of acquisition and use of information. These activities may lead to the transformation of information into knowledge. The primary components of information behaviour are information seeking and information encountering ( Ford, 2005 ).

Knowledge is a system that enables a human or machine to act in the world. This is a complex term with fervently debated definitions, but in the context of this study, knowledge is the synergistic sum of information, cognitive and emotional skills, or the know-how that enables action ( Ford, 2005 ).

Knowledge behaviour is the sum of activities that are part of the processes of evaluating knowledge needs and information behaviour. This definition has a similar meaning to Ford X  X  (2005) definition, but its simplified form is preferred because of its implicit taxonomy and causal relationship between information behaviour and knowledge. 3.1.2. The cognitive context of adoption of innovation
Addressing the knowledge gap associated with the adoption of innovation requires the evaluation of knowledge need and an assessment of information behaviour ( Ford, 2005 ), which includes information-seeking activities. The relationship be-tween the user and the information, or more broadly the knowledge, is one that traditionally has been considered an issue of information system design. The user perspective has gained traction among researchers and influenced information sys-tem design in recent years.

Efforts have been made to bring together computer science, information science, and social science to create a better information seeking model, albeit with not much success ( Vakkari &amp; Jarvelin, 2005 ). One of the reasons for this reluctant relationship is the gap between approaches to information seeking specific to each field (information science and computer science). One approach preferred by computer science researchers focuses on the system design, which is realistic but inflex-
Ford (2005) also found that user studies do not greatly influence major aspects of general system design because the human aspects are so complex; Ford referred to these aspects collectively as  X  X  X ark matter X  X  ( Ford, 2000 ).

CIR expanded the context in which information seeking activities occur beyond the information space and into a context that better captures the motivation and the concerns of the user, which Ingwersen (1996) calls the cognitive space. The user behaviour associated with information seeking does not occur strictly as an isolated process of interaction with a system interface for query purposes, but as a more complex process in which the information seeker learns and adapts as result of the evaluation of the information needs and the influence of social, institutional and broader economic factors ( Spink &amp; Cole, 2005b ).

From a CIR perspective, the evaluation of knowledge need, which in the case of disruptive innovation represents the knowledge gap created by the necessity of utilising a radically different approach, necessitates interaction with information systems that can assist in finding and retrieving the appropriate information. In the cognitive context, the knowledge gap problem needs to be framed in terms of a work-task/interest situation, which is primarily the goal of the information seeking ( Larsen &amp; Ingwersen, 2005 ). Bystr X m and J X rvelin (1995) studied the information seeking processes from the perspective of task complexity, and Ingwersen (1996) discussed the role of work-tasks from a cognitive perspective. Kuhlthau (1991) ana-lysed information seeking from the perspective of a user, and in doing so, she highlighted the importance of the usefulness of the information in resolving the problem being addressed. Belkin (1984) also analysed the problem context in which infor-mation seeking occurs. The context is pragmatic, in which the user wants to solve concrete problems and  X  X  X ealize that their knowledge is insufficient for effective management of the problem X  X . 3.1.3. Limitations of a system-centric view of information behaviour
Recent trends in CIR research indicate a focus on conceptualising information seeking at a human X  X omputer interaction level and at an organisational/societal level ( Spink &amp; Cole, 2005b ). Despite the consideration of other human factors such as emotional states, information behaviour, and knowledge behaviour through extension, remains largely an information systems design affair focused on the quality of the human X  X omputer interface and the effectiveness of the information man-agement systems. Saracevic (1997) developed a model in which he proposes a map of two strata linking the user cognitive, affective and situational process levels to corresponding system levels. However, the model aims to find ways of improving the design of a system rather than help with strategies for improving overall knowledge behaviour.

Belkin (1984) noted that it is much more difficult to build a model of cognitive and affective aspects of user X  X  situation than it is to build a model of knowledge resources. The user cognitive space is vastly more complex than system design mod-els can take into account, at least at the current stage of technological capabilities. Recent models of human information behaviour highlight the fuzzy nature of the notions of relevance and retrieval effectiveness and how difficult it is to map user characteristics onto the parameters of information retrieval systems ( Ford, 2005 ). Given these difficulties, an exclusive focus on system design as a way to respond to information needs limits the range of opportunities that support effective knowl-edge behaviour. 3.2. Knowledge behaviour and the social adoption of innovation model 3.2.1. Need for a broader context of adoption of innovation
Information seeking is a coordination process aimed at managing the cognitive and affective states of the user through the interaction with multiple sources of information ( Spink &amp; Cole, 2005a ). The aim of the process is to take the current state of the user to a selection state in which the knowledge need is understood and the action path is clear. The user undergoes an iterative process of information need evaluation until the selection state is reached ( Larsen &amp; Ingwersen, 2005 ). In the past, information seeking would be primarily limited to one information system servicing the entire organisation. As computing and communication costs drop with technological advances and improved public availability, users increasingly attempt to find information by using a mixture of other systems and human information sources. Research conducted by Sun (2012) shows that users select search tools from a range of information systems, starting from those available internally within the boundaries of their organisations and subsequently moving onto public and free systems accessible over the Internet.
As the array of information toolsets broadens, the users adopt non-linear information behaviour strategies. Foster (2004) discusses information seeking behaviour using a nonlinear model. According to this model, the progression from the current cognitive state to one where the user has a clear understanding of the knowledge need is rather unpredictable, with the user adopting different methods on an ad hoc basis.

It is important to make the distinction between information behaviour and knowledge behaviour (see the previous def-initions). The evaluation of the knowledge need is more than just appraisal of the result returned by information seeking activities. This process is also about evaluating the skills of the users that would enable the creation of new knowledge by acting on the information discovered ( Ford, 2005 ). If the same information is presented to two users with different skills or level of skill, the capacity to act on that information will be different. Larsen and Ingwersen discuss cognitive X  X motional variables that impact what is known about the unknown and the definition of the problem statement. ( Larsen &amp; Ingwersen, 2005 ). Users learn during the information seeking process, but the learning is not limited to understanding the information needs. Users may also identify the need for a different set of cognitive and emotional skills (such as the ability to handle uncertainty and dissatisfaction, the ability to cope with pressure and other external negative influences, and the ability to remain positive, motivated, and perseverant) required to address the knowledge gap ( Ford, 2005 ). This aspect is implicitly recognised by CIR; however, no explicit analysis exists on how the level of cognitive and emotional skills of the user influ-ences knowledge behaviour. The information system-centric view considers that the responsibility of determining the requirements for further training, self-teaching, or professional development sits entirely with the individual user. This pa-per proposes that these aspects should be considered by both innovators and adopters of innovation because these aspects have significant influence on knowledge behaviour and ultimately on the successful adoption of innovation.

Foster (2004) found that one of the most significant aspects of information seeking is the use of social networks:  X  X  X nfor-mation-seeking was dependent upon goodwill networks between individuals from a variety of backgrounds, status and dis-ciplinary origins collaborating to share information X  X . Foster also identifies serendipity as an important part of the information seeking process, which significantly underscores the valuable role of the social networks in effective information behaviour. Ford (2005) highlights the importance of information encountering as complementing the information seeking activities in the process of information need evaluation. This form of information seeking occurs often in a social networking environment and is useful not only for information need re-evaluation but also for learning about other knowledge, skills and problem solving opportunities.

Overall, the above research findings reveal that social interactions act as a sophisticated interface that provides the user with access to knowledge from individual social members and, through extension, to a variety of information systems that may be referred to during the social engagement process. In contrast with the standard human X  X omputer system interac-tion, socially facilitated information behaviour supports the creation of a bidirectional information exchange, which is more reflective of the multi-faceted flow of information that characterises the innovation process.

Because information seeking involves multitasking, the use of multiple sources of information, social interactions and feedback for the purpose of identifying successful knowledge behaviour, we need a broader model that captures the relation-ship between sources of information, the cognitive space of the user, and the socio-economic environmental context. This study proposes a model of the social adoption of innovation ( Fig. 1 ) with multiple sources of information and in which the process of knowledge generation is considered in a holistic manner.

The model extends previous models proposed largely within CIR, and although the models are similar, especially in the area of information retrieval, they are significantly different. The contribution of this model lies in taking the social component from a position of context into a system as an information source similar to a computer based information sys-tem. Although CIR pioneered the idea of the cognitive space in the information retrieval process, the social context was con-fined as an influencer of the cognitive actor. More recently, Ingwersen and Jarvelin (2005, pp. Fig 6.8, page 274) have proposed a model that integrates the information retrieval and the information seeking processes where the social compo-nent was an influencing factor as context and as a provider of relevant feedback. In contrast, the social model of innovation places information behaviour in the context of innovation. The underlying goal is to create knowledge in response to the necessity to fill the knowledge gap produced by innovation. 3.2.2. The Innovation Space
Information is being produced on the basis of factual data, the what-is, occurrences that take place in the  X  X  X eal X  X  world: social, economic, cultural, environmental, and physical, etc. Authors, both humans and machines, interpret factual data to produce semantic objects and store the data in information systems. From a CIR perspective, the information system is the most reliable source of information for the user, who uses the system to run queries. Ideally, users would not only have access to semantic objects, which are created by interpreting factual data and other semantic objects, but also to other rel-evant factual data that has not yet been captured or represented in the information systems in a ready-to-use form. The other factual data needs to be discovered through other means such as direct investigation or interaction with other people (colleagues, friends, other professionals, and experts).

In this model, both the innovator and innovation adopter act as information users. The adopter of innovation seeks infor-mation to address the issue of the knowledge gap (see the information behaviour in the context of innovation section) and applies cognitive, emotional skills and current knowledge to process the needed information to produce knowledge with the purpose of solving a problem. During this process, the actions of the user will create new facts, which will contribute to the growth of the factual data. A portion of these data will be the basis of the information need for the innovator who will take it into consideration to further improve the innovation product or create new innovations. In this case, the innovator plays a similar user role but with a different knowledge need. For example, the innovator is a user who needs to process feedback from the adopters of innovation, factual data related to the use of innovation or other factors that have an impact on theo-retical and practical assumptions that were made during the innovation process.

Social structures provide a gateway to the factual data that are scattered across information systems, natural environ-ments and the memory of people. These structures may provide information that leads to writing better queries, but they also facilitate access to information that is not yet fully captured in a semantic form in any of the information systems as known by the user. In the context of innovation and contemporary environment, these social structures rely on information systems to communicate and function. From small communities of practice to large quasi-communities and social networks, from the local to the global planetary scale, these structures operate on information systems that transmit messages and store information across a vast array of databases ( Dron &amp; Anderson, 2007 ). Therefore, social structures play a dual role, as pure social systems acting as a network providing the emotional support necessary for a healthy working environment and as structures inseparably enmeshed in information systems, acting as information providers with an important role in the information seeking and knowledge creation processes.

The Innovation Space ( Fig. 1 ) is the overarching context in which the cycle of knowledge generation occurs. This space is where the innovators and the adopters of innovation contribute to the creation of knowledge as both users of information and creators of knowledge.

The Innovation Space is a concept containing both material and virtual elements with no precise boundaries. This space is a collection of everything that produces factual data, including sources that are independent of human activity. This space is not limited to one or more information systems because it captures all sources of factual data to represent the true picture of knowledge creation that takes place during the innovation and adoption of innovation processes. The factual data are filtered and processed within information systems and social structures, resulting in semantic objects, which will be subsequently used as information to create knowledge. As an example, if a group of students study astrophysics using an innovative 3-D exploration tool, the students will use information about vast cosmic space. How was that information produced? Factual data generated by distant stars and captured by sophisticated sensors, processed by computers and analysed by authors or machines will become the text, the videos, and the images used in the astrophysics classes. However, the study is not lim-ited to the use of semantic objects obtained through accessing information systems. Students may use direct observations by studying the sky or may interact with colleagues or students from other countries concerning other observable aspects that have not yet been represented in electronic form. 3.2.3. Knowledge, information and skills
In a research literature review ( Cole, Beheshti, Leide, &amp; Large, 2005 ), it was found that there are two cognitive approaches to research in CIR. One approach considers the perspective of the tasks undertaken by the user, and the other approach uses concepts and models borrowed from psychology to determine how the user acquires information. The second approach re-veals the importance of complex thinking activities that determine the actions of the user in information seeking and how information is utilised. Ignoring the way the thinking process operate from a psychological perspective leads to a system designed with the assumption that the user knows what the information needs are, which is not always the case. Belkin and Cool (1995) formulated the opinion that asking users to specify their information need is unrealistic. Not only is the user is not fully aware of the actual information need, but the information seeking activity has a dynamic impact on the knowl-edge structure causing their attitudes and understanding of the information need to change during the information discov-ery. Brookes (1980) symbolically captured the impact of information on the knowledge structure into the fundamental equation for information science: where K [ S ] represents the knowledge structures, D I is the new information, and K [ S + D S ] is the final knowledge structure as a result of processing the new information.

Brookes asserts that the impact of the information depends on the existing knowledge structure and how the information is subjectively interpreted. Todd (1999) applies this equation to the selection process to highlight the learning effect that takes place during the transition process that takes the user from the initial cognitive state to the selection state. As men-tioned earlier, the process is nonlinear and social, especially when the information need is complex ( Foster, 2004 ), and the process is potentially multitasking ( Spink &amp; Cole, 2005a ). Saracevic (1997) developed a model for information retrieval in which cognitive and affective factors influence the information seeking process. Ford (2005) emphasizes the cognitive as-pects of the information behaviour.

From an adoption of innovation perspective, if the utilisation of the same information can cause different knowledge structures, it is important to understand the relationship between the factors that influence the conversion process. The fun-damental equation expressed by Brookes describes the relationship between information and the change in knowledge structure, but the equation does not offer more details about the factors involved. Research in the field of information retrie-val, information seeking and knowledge behaviour has studied various aspects in isolation primarily focused on information seeking, having investigated to a lesser degree the generation of knowledge in its larger social context.

The Innovation Space diagram in Fig. 1 suggests that users will retrieve information from social and information spaces. If two users work on the same task, it is likely that they will have different information behaviours because of their individual experience and preferences for interacting within the two spaces. The querying, the analysis, the information need evalua-tion and the decisions that follow are influenced by the skills and by the actual information retrieved from both sources.
Brookes X  equation implies that users are static and identical and if given the same information they will process it to produce the same knowledge. If we account for the fact that users are dynamic in their pursuit of goals, we could imagine a different model in which the internal skills and motivational compass of the user are utilised to find information, understand it, trans-form it, and possibly learn new skills, to generate knowledge with personal characteristics. The new dynamic model has di-rect implications on how the knowledge gap is being addressed in the adoption of innovation. Bringing together ideas from previous research, this study proposes a symbolic equation for general knowledge behaviour that captures the primary factors engaged in the process: where D K is the knowledge structural change, Sc is current skill, D S is the newly learned skill, D Ii is the information retrieved from the information space, D Is is information retrieved from the Social Space, and Kc is the current knowledge. The symbol ? is used to denote transformational application; the skills and knowledge on the left are applied to the information on the right to transform it into knowledge. Similar to Brookes X  fundamental equation of information science, this is a symbolic equation aimed at expressing the relationship between knowledge structural components in a concise form and should not be considered in absolute quantitative terms.
 The equation for general knowledge simply states that the structural change of knowledge is the result of the sum of skills
P mation spaces.

Like knowledge, the term skill is complex and has multiple meanings for a variety of disciplines. The equation incorpo-rates skills as essential tools for information processing, but it also includes skills that are specific to the knowledge domain in which the information seeking activity is conducted. It is difficult, if not impossible, to make a clear distinction between the types of skills not only because they influence each other, but also because their classification sometimes depends on domain knowledge.

Practice enhances skills to develop the ability to solve problems in more effective ways. Dreyfus (2004) refers to intuitive expertise as a skill level that is acquired in the fifth stage of skill acquisition as the ability to make spontaneous decisions without explicit conscious thinking. In its generic sense, intuitive expertise is a cognitive skill, but when it is developed in the context of a professional practice, it becomes a specialist skill strongly linked to the specific knowledge domain.
The same person will be at different level of skill in a different area of practice based on experience and knowledge ( Benner, 2004 ). A skill has a procedural aspect and a judgmental, character-based, practical aspect founded on practice within a com-munity of practitioners ( Benner, 2004 ). Calderhead (1991) noted that  X  X  X nowledge that guides the action has been viewed as oriented towards problem solving and qualitatively different from the knowledge of facts and subject matter that informs the content of teaching X  X .

The inclusion of skill in the equation has an important significance; users with the same knowledge will process infor-mation in different ways and with different levels of proficiency and speed depending on the skill level. From the point of view of information behaviour, the importance of this assertion is that users will have different experiences and achieve dif-ferent outcomes. A significant cognitive gap caused by the lack of adequate level of skill will greatly disrupt the information seeking process because of the inability to process the information effectively. As Vakkari and Jarvelin (2005) noted, the costs of IR systems  X  X  X hould be justified by the quality of the deliverables for some necessary and important work tasks X  X . A cog-nitive gap that is not recognised and addressed will lead to low-quality deliverables, with a negative impact on the adoption of innovation.

Because information seeking activities are nonlinear, multitasking, and social, extending beyond the boundaries of one information system, the skills required for effective querying of various sources of information ( Fig. 1 ) are becoming impor-tant to the success of information seeking strategies ( Sun, 2012 ). Thus, the skills required to address the knowledge gap con-cern not only the knowledge domain in which the innovation is applied, but also the effective operation in the Information Space and in the Social Space. The relationship is expressed in the equation for general information seeking skills below: In this equation the components are as follow: D Si is the skill improvement needed to operate in the Information Space,
D Ss is the skill improvement needed to operate in the Social Space and D Sp is the need for professional skill improvement relevant to the work-task or domain interest.

The equation for general information seeking skills shows that for a user adopting an innovation, skill development may be required for effective information seeking. This has profound implications for the diffusion of innovation strategies. Inno-vators must fully understand who the users of their innovations are and estimate their cognitive gap in regards to the pro-posed innovation. Armed with that understanding, the innovators need to provide adequate cognitive support to their adopters to help them overcome challenges of knowledge behaviour.

If the complexity of the knowledge gap is low, which indicates that the information need is simple, a good system design may be sufficient to address the cognitive gap with the inclusion of smart cognitive structures and algorithms. Ford (2005) refers to the prominent role of the system design as  X  X  X upplanting cognitive activity X  X . However, in the context of complex information needs, users must make decisions by themselves and select suitable information retrieval (IR) components. Ford continues to say  X  X  X sers would need to possess appropriate knowledge of the alternative IR components available to them (for example, retrieval algorithms, output options, query expansion facilities, inference rules, learning mechanisms, etc.), and of the implications of choices, sequences and combinations of them in terms of system behaviour and performance in relation to their needs X  X  ( Ford, 2005 ). Consequently, as indicated by the general information seeking skills equation, the acquisition of appropriate skills comes through learning how to use the information systems, learning how to operate in the Social Space, and if necessary, by acquiring professional skills through training programs.

The symbolic equation shows that seeking information cannot always be resolved entirely through better information system design. The equation indicates that a better approach is to also use social links to find relevant information and maximise the chance of coming across new information that could not have been found by only running queries through standard computer user interfaces. Large social networks provide opportunities for serendipity and for combining expertise from adjacent disciplines that lead to new and unexpected solutions. 3.2.4. The Social Space
The smallest social structure that has a dominant role in the adoption of innovation ( Badilescu-Buga, 2011 ), the commu-nity of practice, is characterised by the close-knit relationship between its members ( Wenger, McDermott, &amp; Snyder, 2002 ).
This community is typical for the initial stage, where the adopting innovators apply innovation to create new ways of prac-tice. This social structure is critical to the spread of the innovation because its members are the first to demonstrate the applicability of the innovation and discover how to overcome initial difficulties. The members of this community are usually highly skilled professionals that have known each other for some time and frequently meet face-to-face ( Wenger &amp; Snyder, 2000 ). Despite their close-knit structure, the communities of practice today rely on ubiquitous information technology for communication and sharing of information. Larger social structures also depend on the use of Internet-based networks for communication, creating relationships between individual members that do not know each other in person and linking smaller communities of practice ( Hung &amp; Nichani, 2002 , Dron &amp; Anderson, 2007 ).

The fact that these social structures operate on the back of large and sophisticated computer networks makes them simul-taneously social communication gateways and generators of factual data that feed into the Information Space. This gives the social structures in the Social Space a critical role in the adoption of innovation life cycle.

In the past decade, the Internet, mobile networks, and large number of software applications have dropped the cost of communication to virtually zero. These applications have changed the way people connect to each other around the globe, adding to broadcasting and one-on-one modes of transmission online conversation as many-to-many interactions between people. This shift has created vast opportunities for sharing, collaboration and collective action at a scale not previously pos-sible ( Shirky, 2009 ). The individual community members on average contribute little to the creation of content, which be-comes significant when aggregated. This amplified contribution makes the large social structures (quasi-communities and social networks) valuable not only for those who enjoy the benefit of accessing abundant content but also for those who con-tribute in a variety of social and professional roles by having opportunities to address a large audience. In a large online com-munity with a high level of trust, members feel enticed to participate in the creation of a valuable support structure ( Dron &amp; Anderson, 2007 ), using their cognitive surplus for the benefit of others ( Shirky, 2010 ).

From the perspective of information behaviour, large social structures offer support for both forms of information retrie-val: serendipity and search ( Ford, 2005 ). Foster (2004) found that serendipity is widely experienced and valued as a form of information behaviour. Finding information occurs in the Social Space in a direct way by engaging with social members with specific knowledge on the subject. Alternatively, indirect methods involve social members providing guidance on where to find sources of information, either within the Social Space, by referring to other people, or within the Information Space, by referring to other specific information systems. A research study on personal information management practices of teachers ( Diekema &amp; Olsen, 2011 ) supports the idea that finding information through social networks plays a vital role in solving work-task problems. The study found that teachers draw information from a variety of sources and surprisingly rarely use their school library media centres. Their online information seeking behaviour reflects a wide range of patterns influ-enced by a large number of variables, one of which is prominent: teachers  X  X  X ike the social aspects of the Internet and the ability to share resources and advice on how to use them in the classroom X  X  ( Diekema &amp; Olsen, 2011 ). The study shows that teachers highly value their social networks as a way of finding information.

One distinction between Information Space and Social Space consists of the time necessary for authoring agents operating in each space to create semantic representations. In the Information Space, professional or specialised authors need time to identify, consider and process selected factual data to create semantic objects. More time is then necessary, varying from immediate to days, weeks, months or even years for other authoring agents to create cognitive representations needed for filing and for making the original semantic object searchable and discoverable. For instance, when a community of prac-tice solves a problem after several experiments and discussions among the group members, the approach could be shared with members outside the community through social links. Alternatively, someone would document the experience by interviewing the original community members and publish the results. Later, the published material will be made available in the Information Space in form of an article, or a book with links, abstracts, purchase information, etc. Numerous semantic objects are created by machine-authors, which are software programs that generate semantic objects automatically. For in-stance, a software program that continuously monitors the interaction between students and educational gaming software could generate a sophisticated report describing behavioural patterns of students during the game play.

In the Social Space, members of the social structures generate semantic objects (written, verbal or visual) in an extremely short period of time by using a combination of factual data, semantic objects and personal knowledge. As an example, some-one discussing a work-task in a Google+ hangout session may receive information created in real time by the other partic-ipants. Users find information within the Social Space not only through serendipity and creative processes, but also through direct queries. For instance, one user could ask a question on Quora web site and quickly receive answers from the network members who already possess the required knowledge to generate meaningful semantic objects (answers in text form) or produce references to other sources of information.

The contribution of social group members, sometimes referred to as cognitive surplus, to supporting information seeking activities could be significant ( Shirky, 2010 ). Finding information through social structures is critical to bringing adopters to a cognitive selection state in which a clear strategy of addressing the information need is formed ( Foster, 2004 ). Taylor found that the cognitive state of the subject changes during the information seeking process, which indicates that the information retrieval system needs to be dynamic, adaptive, and provide search criteria beyond topicality ( Taylor, 2012 ). The social struc-tures provide a level of adaptability beyond the level offered through system design, complementing the sources of informa-tion found in information systems. 4. Discussion
The analysis and the findings indicate that with the ubiquity of computing devices and the non-existent cost of commu-nication thanks to the spread of the Internet, adopters of innovation increasingly rely on social networks to find information that helps them address their knowledge needs.

Although social networks existed before the Internet arrived, these networks are now enmeshed with rapid communica-tion infrastructures that enables users to access information and be influenced by that information in ways that traditional information systems could not. Whereas CIR expanded the user space to include other social economic and institutional as-pects, this study is proposing that we need to expand the information space to include social networks. Because of the tech-nological base of social networks, future search engines could combine the two spaces and offer its users the ability to search using a more traditional human X  X achine interface and an electronic human to human interface that helps interact with members of the social network for information searching and encountering through serendipity.

The theoretical contribution of this paper is the establishment of a model for social adoption of innovation in which both the social and computer information systems play simultaneously the role of sourcing information to the user who is both an innovator and adopter of innovation. The goals that initiate the processing of information generate knowledge as needed for their successful accomplishment. In examining the process of knowledge generation, the paper proposes two equations for general knowledge behaviour and general information seeking skills.

The symbolic equations are an attempt to break down knowledge behaviour into components that makes it easier to establish strategies for both innovation design and the adoption of innovation with application at an organisational level.
From the point of view of the innovator, it is important to anticipate the level of skills of the targeted adopters in three areas: (1) Are these adopters sufficiently skilled to use the systems that are involved in adoption? (2) Are the adopters skilled at interacting with members of social networks and taking advantage of the knowledge that the networks might be able to share? and (3) Do the adopters possess adequate professional skills in the field where the innovation is applied?
Similarly, from the point of view of the adopters, an understanding of the effort that is required to adopt the innovation is needed to evaluate the following aspects: (1) How much do I know about the systems involved?, (2) What is my social net-work supporting me in undertaking this adoption?, and (3) Do I need additional professional training to understand the application of this particular innovation?
In practice, the questions the innovator is asking need to be reflected the design of the innovative product to match the level of skills of the adopters in each area, whereas the adopters will need to evaluate the effort required for a successful adoption. Further research is needed to validate the theoretical model. 5. Conclusion
Addressing the knowledge gap caused by the adoption of disruptive innovation is a challenge that is resolved through evaluating the information need, seeking information, and generating knowledge as required in the context of applying the innovation in practice. This paper extends the information seeking activities beyond the use of individual information systems and included social structures in the form of social networks. The result of research literature review in the field of information retrieval and adoption of online learning design in education is the proposal of a model of social adoption of innovation where adopters and innovators interact with sources of information that combine traditional information sys-tems and social structures. The study also extends the Brookes X  (1980) equation for information science to two new symbolic equations that reflect the contribution of social structures to knowledge behaviour and the necessity of evaluation of three types of skills involved in knowledge behaviour.

This research opens new perspective in the formulation of strategies for innovation design, the spread of innovation and the adoption of innovation. The suggested approach is for information system design to consider the broader context of information seeking activities, which includes technology-supported social structures. The research also suggests a more comprehensive approach from the perspective of the adopting individual and organisation, which includes not only aspects related to access to information through information systems, but also realises that successful adoption needs to consider the skills involved and exposure to the knowledge of other people shared through social networks, which change in a fluid fashion as adoption goes from the innovators and early adopters stage to early and late majority stages ( Rogers, 2003 ).

The next step is to use the social adoption of innovation model to design a collaborative research project that will monitor the adoption of online learning design systems in schools. The research project will collect data regarding information seek-ing, the use of information systems, social interactions, skill level, perceptions and adoption outcomes that will verify the validity of the model. The findings will be published in a future article. Acknowledgement I would like to thank Professor James Dalziel from Macquarie University for his great support and guidance.
