 Wikipedia 1 is a free, Wiki-based encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and it con-tains a huge number of articles (4,465,757 articles in the English version and 898,433 articles in the Japanese version; 2014/3/6 ). Wikipedia ontologies (e.g., YAGO2 [2] and the Japanese Wikipedia ontology [5]) have been constructed to utilize the semantic information in Wikipedia. In each of these ontologies, a con-cept hierarchy has been constructed bas ed on information from the Wikipedia category structure. In addition, several approaches have been used to calculate the semantic similarity based on the category structure [3,4], [6].
However, the Wikipedia category structure was originally designed for nav-igation, to help users find appropriate articles, and it is not equivalent to the concept hierarchy in Wikipedia ontologi es. In this study, we briefly review the definition of a Wikipedia category and its structure based on the information provided in Wikipedia. Using this definition, we exhaustively investigate the category structure of the Japanese Wikipedia (not by random sampling) and discuss the types of parent X  X hild category pairs in this category structure based on syntactic patterns. We also discuss how category structure information can be utilized to construct an ontology and to calculate a semantic similarity measure. Each Wikipedia article (or  X  X age X ) is about some named entity or concept. These articles are organized into categories that aim to group together pages on similar subjects 2 . The categories are in turn organized as overlapping  X  X rees X  using parent X  X hild category pairs.

In this section, we briefly review the definition of a Wikipedia article and category, and discuss how Wikipedia onto logies can be constructed based on the information provided in Wikipedia. We use boxes to reference sentences found in Wikipedia. 2.1 Articles The definition of a Wikipedia article is as follows.  X  X  Wikipedia article, or entry, is a page that has encyclopedic information on it X  a .
Most articles contain information about a particular named entity or concept and they include the following types of information.  X  Title: a string that represents the particular named entity or concept (target)  X  Description: a summary that represents the target.  X  Infobox: structured information about the target in a tabular format.  X  Text: a detailed description of the target, which is organized into sections.  X  Category: an index used to characterize the target.
 Fig. 1 shows an example of an article.

DBpedia [1] extracts structured information, mainly from infoboxes, and or-ganizes this information into a database. A DBpedia ontology has also been constructed manually, and it contains 590 concepts for classes (DBpedia Ontol-ogy 3.9) that maintain the class X  X nstance relationships between concepts and articles. YAGO2 [2] is a huge semantic knowledge base derived from Wikipedia, WordNet, and GeoNames. In addition to the structural information extracted from DBpedia, an information concept hierarchy has also been constructed, con-taining more than 350,000 classes from WordNet and the category structure of Wikipedia. In these classes, most of the Wikipedia category names are used as class labels, and the class X  X nstance relationships are maintained using category and article relationships.

The Japanese Wikipedia ontology [5] also uses infoboxes to extract struc-tural information, in which the category names are used as class labels, and the relationships between articles and cate gories are employed as class X  X nstance re-lationships. However, Wikipedia categories were originally designed to facilitate navigation by Wikipedia users, and several categories are not appropriate for representation using a concept hierarchy in a Wikipedia ontology. 2.2 Wikipedia Categories In Wikipedia, a category and a category tree structure are defined as follows.  X  X ategories are used in Wikipedia to link articles under a common topic X  a .  X  X ategories are organized as overlapping  X  X rees X , formed by creating links between inter-related categories (in mathematics or computer science this structure is called a lattice or a partially ordered set). Any category may contain (or  X  X ranch into X ) subcategories, and it is possible for a category to be a child category of more than one  X  X arent X  category. (A is said to be a parent category of B when B is a child category of A). There are following two main kinds of category.
Sometimes, for convenience the two types can be combined, to create a set-and-topic category (such as Category:Voivodeships of Poland, which con-tains articles about particular Voivodeships as well as articles relating to
Voivodeships in general) X  b .
Based on this definition, it is appropriate to use set categories as class defini-tions in the concept structure. However , it is necessary to consider the appropri-ateness of using topic categories and set-and-topic categories as class definitions. 3.1 Syntactic Patterns for Category Analysis The discussion in the previous section shows that it is essential to clarify the types of categories used to construct the concept structure based on the Wikipedia cat-egory tree structure.

In order to understand the types of categories employed in Wikipedia, we analyzed the categories and category tree structures in the Japanese Wikipedia.
We obtained all the Japanese Wikipedia category information from a data dump on 2013/8/18, which comprised 121,346 categories. From these categories, we excluded the categories related to Wiki pedia maintenance (e.g., H elp, stub, and template) and those with year information (e.g.,  X 1975(movies from 1975) X ), which yielded 99,902 categories for the analysis. These categories included 208,999 parent X  X hild category pairs.

In the analysis, we classified the categor ies using syntactic patterns. Based on a preliminary analysis of the categories, we found that most of the categories could be represented by the following elements (Fig. 2).  X  Noun: represents a topic term (e.g.,  X (Japan) X ,  X  (Company) X ).  X  Verb phrase: represents a relationship between nouns (e.g.,  X  (featured) X ,  X  Japanese particles: represent a relationship between nouns and verb phrases  X  Conjunction: represents a relationship between nouns and verb phrases (e.g.,  X  Additional information: represents information that facilitates disambigua- X  Modifier: represents additional information about a term (e.g.,  X (defunct) X ).
Additional information and modifiers were not important for the detailed analysis, so we excluded this information from the labels in the subsequent anal-ysis.
Table 1 shows the numbers of syntactic expression patterns for different cate-gory labels. In this analysis, we used MeCab for morphological analysis, except for specific types of proper nouns. For example, the Japanese animation movie  X  (Castle in the Sky) X  belongs to the pattern Noun ( X  (sky) X ) +  X (no) X  + Noun ( X (rapyuta: castle) X ) according to the MeCab resul ts. We checked the proper nouns manually and categorized them as Noun only .
 3.2 Analysis of Category Labels The analysis in Section 3.1 showed that the Noun only and Noun +  X (no) X  + Noun patterns were the two most common patterns (96.6% in total), and thus we focused on a detailed analysis of these two patterns.

The Noun only patterns included proper nouns and common nouns. However, most of the Noun +  X (no) X  + Noun patterns constructed from nouns were Noun only .

It is not easy to discuss the characteristics of labels for Noun only patterns, so we used Noun +  X (no) X  + Noun patterns to analyze different types of nouns. In this analysis, the labels of the first and last nouns were N a and N b , respectively ( N a + X (no) X + N b ).

For N a , there were 18,449 unique nouns, and Table 2 shows the most frequent ones. For N b , there were 5,525 unique nouns, and Table 3 shows the most frequent ones.
 When we checked the frequently used nouns, we found many proper nouns for N , but few proper nouns for N a . Therefore, in many cases, N a + X (no) X + N b patterns were construct ed using topic terms for N a and set terms for N b .This information was useful for identifying the type of noun in Noun only patterns. 3.3 Analysis of Parent X  X hild Category Pairs Among the 208,999 parent X  X hild category pairs, we used 192,601 (92.2%) Noun only and Noun +  X (no) X  + Noun pairs in this analysis. These pairs were cate-gorized into four types (Table 4).

First, we analyzed the Noun +  X (no) X  + Noun and Noun +  X (no) X  + Noun pairs. Most of these pairs shared commo n nouns in the parent and child cate-gories. These relationships comprised four types. Table 5 shows examples of the category pairs and their frequencies.

The first type shared both nouns ( N a + X (no) X + N b  X  N a + X (no) X + N b ), and these pairs included additional information used mostly for disambiguation.
The second type shared the first noun ( N a + X (no) X + N b  X  N a + X (no) X  + N b ). Table 6 shows common examples of these pairs, which included concept hierarchy pairs (e.g.,  X (sportsperson) X ) and related terms (e.g.,  X  (geography) X ). The third type shared the last noun ( N a + X (no) X + N b  X  N a + X (no) X + N b ). Table 7 shows common examples of these pairs, which included class X  X nstance pairs (e.g.,  X (by nation) X ) and  X  X eographically-part-of X  relationship terms (e.g.,  X (Japan) X ).

Table 8 shows pairs for ( X (by nation) X ). It was easy to extract class X  X nstance pairs by identifying common pairs, but the low-frequency terms contained several errors in some cases.
 The last type did not share nouns ( N a + X (no) X + N b  X  N a + X (no) X + N ). Typical pairs of this type related to universities and professors are shown in Table 5. In this case, it would be better to have an intermediate category  X  (Sapporo City University) X  to maintain the consistency among parent X  X hild category pairs. This is true for several universities with multiple categories (e.g.,  X  (University of Tokyo) X ), but Wikipedia guidelines may not allow the production of intermediate categories with only one child category.

Table 9 shows three Noun and Noun +  X  (no) X  + Noun patterns. For the first two patterns, most of the set-and-topic categories had set and topic categories as parent categories. It is appropriate to use N b  X  N a + X (no) X + N b patterns (set  X  set-and-topic) in the concept hierarchy, but N (topic  X  set-and-topic) may not be suitable for concept hierarchy construction. Thus, related terms (e.g.,  X (age) X  and  X (long life) X ) could be extracted to analyze the latter patterns.
 Table 10 shows the patterns for the Noun +  X (no) X  + Noun and Noun pairs. Sixteen exceptions shared nouns, but all o f these cases were related to additional information provided for disambiguation. The remaining pairs had three types of relationships: class X  X nst ance relationships between N b and N c (examples are shown in Table 10); class X  X ubc lass relationships between N b and N c ,suchas  X (Japanese) (no) (song) X   X   X (Enka: Japanese music genre) X ; and geographically-part-of relationships between N a and N c , such as  X (Hyogo) (no) (municipalities) X   X   X  (Kobe City). X 
To evaluate the distributions of the relationship types for the parent X  X hild category pairs, we manually constructed a database to classify the parent X  X hild category pairs using category information.

As shown in Tables 6 X 8, it was not difficult to classify the highly frequent pairs with Noun +  X  (no) X  + Noun and Noun +  X (no) X  + Noun patterns. However, because the irregular pairs included some low-frequency pairs with different characteristics, we investigated these pairs and excluded irregular pairs from the final dataset.
We also used pairs with Noun ( N a )+ X (no) X +Noun( N b ) and Noun ( N c ) patterns to extract class X  X nstance and geographically-part-of relationships. Table 11 shows the number of manually classified relationship pairs in the database for each relationship type. The manual construction process required approximately 30 hours using a single assessor.

Table 12 shows the distribution of the relationship types for nouns among the Noun ( N a )+ X (no) X +Noun( N b )  X  Noun ( N a )+ X (no) X +Noun( N b ) pairs in the database. The results show that many instances belonged to the type N a , but very few instances belonged to N b . In addition, many cases had  X  X nstance X  X nstance X  relationships linking N a  X  N a .  X (Japanese) (no) (train) X   X   X  (JR East) (no) (train) X  is a typical example of this type of relationship, which shows that  X (JR East) X  is a company in  X (Japan). X  Most of these relationships represented attribute value relationships, which was also the case for  X  X nstance X  other X  relationships. However,  X  X ther X  X nstance X  relationships included various types of relationships, and it was necessary to investigate them in more detail.
The number of nouns categorized as  X  X ther X  for N b  X  N b was higher than that for N a  X  N a because many cases used abstract keywords that represented specific domains (e.g.,  X (culture), X   X (history), X  and  X (geography) X ) for N b .For example,  X (Asian) (no) (culture) X   X   X (Asian) (no) (language) X  might not be class X  X ubclass or class X  instance relationships.

Table 13 shows the distribution of the relationship types for nouns in Noun ( N a )+ X (no) X +Noun( N b )  X  Noun ( N c ) pairs in the database. These results show that the relationships N a  X  N c and N b  X  N c had similar characteristics to N a  X  N a and N b  X  N b in Table 12, respectively. Table 14 shows the distri-bution of the relationship types for nouns in Noun ( N a )  X  Noun ( N b ) pairs in the database. These results show that the more than half of relationship are categorized by the manually cons tructed data 12, respectively.
 3.4 Discussion In this study, we conducted an exhaustive analysis of parent X  X hild category pairs in the Japanese Wikipedia. Using a manually constructed dataset, we charac-terized parent X  X hild category pairs with specific syntactic patterns. The results of this analysis are summarized as follows.

 Ontology Construction. It is necessary to exclude information related to instances to utilize a general concept hierarchy based on Wikipedia category information. In order to identify the names of instances, we can use highly fre-quent nouns and their child category names to support a manual instance name-construction process. This operation facilitates the more precise utilization of the concept hierarchy.
 Semantic Similarity Measure Calculation. It is preferable to use a general concept hierarchy to perform semantic similarity measure calculations. Attribute information may also be helpful for this purpose. For example, two songs that belong to  X (Japanese) (no) (composition and recording) X  may be more similar than one from  X (Japanese) (no) (composition and recording) X  and one from  X (French) (no) (composition and recording). X  However, the depth of this type of attribute-based category depends on the number of articles in Wikipedia, and there is a lack of consistency among similar categories. The following are examples of the shortest paths for parent X  X hild category pairs.  X   X (Tokyo) (no) (university) X   X   X  (University of Tokyo) X   X   X (University of  X   X  (Hokkaido) (no) (university) X   X   X  (Hokkaido University) X   X   X (Hokkaido  X   X  (Hokkaido) (no) (university) X   X   X  (Sapporo City University) (no) (profes-Two methods can be used to normalize these differences: normalizing categories by extracting set categories only from set-and-topic categories, or generating sim-ilar category structures for the same set category. For example, all set-and-topic categories should have set and topic categories for their parent categories, and all university categories should have  X (people) X  and  X (professors) X  hierarchical categories. The use of the latter approach can also support the construction of set-and-topic categories with SPARQL queries based on the infobox information extracted by DBpedia. In this study, we performed an exhaustive analysis of the category structure in the Japanese Wikipedia to facilitate the use of this structure as a concept hierarchy in Wikipedia ontologies. We confirmed that various types of parent X  child category relationships were present in the structure. We also found that it was not easy to construct syntactic patterns to allow the automatic classifica-tion of parent X  X hild category relationships. However, frequency-based analysis may be helpful for constructing a noun-to-noun relationships database, includ-ing class X  X nstance, class X  X ubclass, and ge ographically-part-of patterns. Finally, we suggested guidelines about how to use the category structure for ontology construction and for calculating semantic similarity measures.

In future research, we plan to construct a large noun-to-noun relationships database based on the category structure, and we will also consider the irregular types of parent X  X hild category pairs. This database may provide a basis for constructing a Japanese Wikipedia ontology.
