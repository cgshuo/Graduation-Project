 In this paper, we describe some preliminary work on us-ing monolingual projections of document collections for per-forming cross-language informat ion retrieval tasks. The pro-posed methodology uses multidimensional scaling for pro-jecting the vector-space representations of a given multilin-gual document collection into spaces of lower dimensional-ity. An independent projection is computed for each differ-ent language, and the structural similarities of the resulting projections are exploited for information retrieval tasks.

Recently, cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) has been gaining importance as more multilingual information has become available in the World Wide Web. According to [3], four different strategies are typically used for CLIR. One of them is based on cognates, for which untranslatable and/or similar terms (in case of close languages) are used for matching the query. The other three strategies are based on using available techniques for: translating the query, trans-lating the documents, or computing an intermediate repre-sentation (interlingua) for both, query and documents.
The most prominent method in the interlingua category uses latent semantic indexing (LSI) to create a multilingual vector-space representation for parallel collections [2]. In the method proposed here, instead of using a multilingual vector-space representation, monolingual vector representa-tions are used for documents in a given multilingual collec-tion. Then, each representation is projected into a lower di-mensional space using a non-linear projection method, more specifically MDS (multidimensional scaling) [1]. Then the
Suppose we are interested in using the projections of fig-ure 1 for performing CLIR of new documents, any of the three monolingual maps can be actually used for the retrieval task. We will refer to the documents defining the maps as anchor documents. First of all, a procedure for placing any new document into its corresponding monolingual map is re-quired (since MDS projections are data dependent, including the new document with the original anchor documents and performing a new projection with MDS is not an option). Two methods are proposed for document placement: a lin-ear approximation, and optimization. Only the first method is evaluated here.

The linear projection approximation uses a transforma-tion matrix T to project the distances between a given doc-ument vector d and all anchor documents measured in the original vector space into coordinates in the projected low-dimensional vector space. Such a transformation matrix is estimated from anchor documents as follows: T = MD  X  1 , where M is a k  X  n matrix containing the k coordinates of the n anchor documents in the projected vector space, and D is an n  X  n matrix containing the distances between every pair of anchor documents in the original vector space.
Optionally, an optimization procedure could be used to place a new document in the map preserving the ratios of its distances to all anchor documents as much as possible with respect to the distances in the original vector space.
Finally, CLIR can be achieved by using the described doc-ument placement methods to place documents of different languages in the same map. Any document in language A canbeplacedinamapinlanguage B by computing dis-tances with respect to language-A anchor documents in the original vector space and using the transformation matrix (or performing the optimization procedure) computed with language-B anchor documents.
In this section we present some preliminary results com-paring the proposed methodology with the LSI approach [2].
Each result presented in figure 2 (continuous lines) rep-resents the mean value of 30 retrieval experiments  X  the corresponding standard deviation (dotted lines). For each experiment, 30 documents were randomly selected as train-ing (anchor), and other 30 documents as test data collection.
The retrieval task consisted of recovering a document us-ing the same document in a different language as a query. The y  X  axis represents the proportion of successful retrievals considering the top-1 retrieved document and the x  X  axis the space dimensionality used for the projections. Reduction of dimensionality to k in LSI is achieved by using only the largest k singular values. In our method k is a parameter of the MDS-projection and results were computed by placing all test documents into the English maps. Even for Spanish-Chinese CLIR, we used the English projection to place doc-uments of both languages in the reduced space where the actual CLIR-task is performed.
A novel method for CLIR which exploits the structural similarity among MDS-based monolingual projections of a multilingual collection was proposed.

Preliminary results have shown that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to the LSI approach,
