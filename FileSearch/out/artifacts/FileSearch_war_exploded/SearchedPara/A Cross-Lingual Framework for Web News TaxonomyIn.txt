 There are currently many Web news sites providing online news articles. Therefore, many Web news portals, such as AltaVista News [1] and Google News [2], arise to provide clustered news categories for users to browse more related news articles with a consistent interface. With the news clustering services provided by the Web news por-tals, users can rapidly click the related news links for more comprehensive information. However, to the best of our knowledge, most Web news portals only provide monolin-gual news clustering services. Users cannot eas ily find the related news articles of the same news event in different languages.

Consider the following example. Fig. 1 shows two news articles of the same story [3] in English and Chinese separately. The title of the English news focuses on  X  X irst impressions X . However, the meaning of the Chinese title is somehow changed to  X  X all in love at first sight X . Although these two titles have similar information semantically and a reader, say Alice, can speak English and Chinese fluently, she may hardly find the corresponding Chinese news article from the title of the English news. Furthermore, Fig. 1 shows another problem existing in most translated news articles. The amount of information of a news article is likely not equal to that of the correspondingly translated news article. In Fig. 1, the length of the English article is much longer than that of the Chinese article. This example reveals that finding other corresponding news articles in different languages may help readers get more information.

The above example shows that the integration of two Web news taxonomies in differ-ent languages can provide Web surfers more abundant information. Such an automatic integration framework has two advantages as follows. First, it can save much news searching time resulted from the cumbersome searching procedure in which readers need to query different monolingual news sources in a trial-and-error manner. Second, the relevance accuracy can be still maintained no matter from what kind of language barriers the readers may suffer.

Recently, the Web taxonomy integration problem [4] has been obtained much atten-tion to integrate the documents in a source taxonomy into a destination taxonomy by utilizing the implicit source information. In the past few years, many studies have pro-posed excellent approaches with which the integration accuracy can be highly improved [4,5,6,7,8,9]. Several classificatio n techniques have been comprehensively studied in the recent research work, such as enhanced Naive Bayes (e.g. [4]), SVM-based ap-proaches (e.g. [5,6,9]), and the maximum entropy model (e.g. [8]). Their experimental results show that improvements can be effectively achieved.

For some researchers as stated in [10], this may be a general cross-lingual infor-mation retrieval (CLIR) problem for news documents and can be easily solved with the assistance of some high-quality training resources and high-performance machine translation tools. However, there are still two major challenges in constructing a frame-work to perform cross-lingual Web news taxonomy integration. First, since the content size of the source taxonomy may be very different with that of the destination taxonomy as shown in Fig. 1, traditional integration techniques may have poor performance. Sec-ond, the integration problem is more complicated because the viewpoints of the source news taxonomy may be very different from the viewpoints of the destination taxonomy. The perceptional differences cannot be dealt with at the translation level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find the taxonomy mapping relationships from bilingual ne ws categories with the aids of the semantically over-lapped information. The proposed framework employs two major past research ob-servations. First, the performance of clustering prior to translation is better than the performance of clustering following translation [11]. This means that documents in the same language are preferably clustered into mono lingual categories first. Then all the categories are clustered again with trans lation. Second, the semantically overlapped in-formation between two categories can be effectively discovered and learnt through a cross-training approach to find the probabilistic mappings [5]. Therefore, the integra-tion performance can be improved when the probabilistic mappings are explored.
To the news taxonomy integration problem, our framework considers the mapping relationships between a source category and a destination category (the category-to-category mappings) rather than the relationships between a source news article and a destination category (the article-to-category mappings), usually studied in most of the traditional Web taxonomy integration research [4,5,6,7,8,9]. This is because we have observed that even if a less related news article is integrated on the category-to-category basis, most readers will not notice this less accurate integration. Besides, if the integra-tion is performed on an article-to-category basis, some highly important news article may be miss-classified into other categories due to the performance limitation of cur-rent article-to-category integration approaches [4,5,6,7,8,9]. In this case, the readers will be confused when they read some totally unrelated but miss-integrated news ar-ticles. Although the integration on the cat egory-to-category may also incorrectly find associations, this can be easily controlled with thresholds. Therefore, the cross-lingual Web news integration problem considered in this paper is to find the mapping relation-ship of two corresponding categories in different languages.

We have constructed the framework with SVM-based classifiers called SVM-BCT (Bilingual Cross-Training). We have also conducted several experiments to compare the accuracy performance of SVM-BCT with that of SVM by 92 manually identified mappings in a 14-day period. The experimental results show that SVM-BCT can be tuned to outperform SVM in all cases. If SVM-BCT is not properly tuned, it still has the same performance as SVM in the worst case.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the problem definitions, and briefly review previous related research on Web taxonomy integration. Section 3 elaborates the proposed cross-training framework. Section 4 describes our experiments in which English news and Chinese news articles from Google News were used as the data sets. Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses future directions. Like the definitions in [4], we assume that the integration process deals with two Web news taxonomies which are in different languages. One taxonomy is the source S in which the news articles have been classified into m event groups (i.e. clusters) S 1 , S 2 , ..., S m . Another is the destination taxonomy D in which the news articles have been also classified into n clusters D 1 , D 2 , ..., D n . The integration is to discover the category-to-category mapping relationships between S and D ,i.e. S i  X  D j . Optimistically, if S and D j are of the same news event, their f eature sets should be completely semanti-cally overlapped. However, their mapping relationship may not be accurately identified because of the following two factors: the unbalanced amount of information between S and D , and the translation mismatches resulted from the perceptional differences. There are many approaches proposed for the general taxonomy integration problem. For example, an enhanced Naive Bayes (ENB) approach is first presented in [4] and then becomes the baseline for the following research. In [6], a Cluster Shrinkage (CS) approach is applied to SVM to improve the performance by shrinking the documents with semantic overlapping. In [7], a co-bootstrapping approach shows its enhancement by utilizing many weak hypotheses in a co-training procedure. In [9], an iterative SVM-based (SVM-IA) approach is proposed to improve the classification accuracy by iter-ative pseudo-relevance feedbacks and exploring auxiliary source information. In [8], a maximum entropy model is employed to enhance the performance. However, since these approaches perform the integration process on an article-to-category basis, they are not suitable for the news taxonomy integration problem.

Our framework uses a bilingual cross-training (BCT) approach adapted from the cross-training (CT) approach proposed in [5] to solve the taxonomy integration prob-lem. The CT approach is a semi-supervised learning strategy. The idea behind CT is that a better classifier can be built with the assistance of another catalog that has seman-tic overlap relationships. The overlapped document set is fully-labelled and partitioned into a tune-set and a test set where the tune-set is used to tune the system performance and the test set is used to evaluate the system. Through the cross-training process, the implicit information in the source taxonomy is learnt, and more source documents can be accurately integrated into the destination taxonomy. To improve the bilingual Web news taxonomy integration performance, we propose a bilingual cross-training (BCT) framework with the aids of the source taxonomy infor-mation. The BCT framework performs the integration process on a category-to-category basis and is implemented with SVM classifiers. 3.1 The Processing Flow Fig. 2 depicts the processing flow in the BCT framework. Without the loss of the gen-erosity, here we use English and Chinese as two language representatives for our bilin-gual processing discussion in this paper.

In the framework, the classification system first retrieves English and Chinese news articles from news portals, say Google News or Yahoo! News [12]. Since these news articles usually have been well-clustered by the news portals, SVM-BCT does not re-cluster these articles. Because the performance of clustering prior to translation is better than the performance of clustering following translation [11], SVM-BCT can be bene-fitted form this observation to process these monolingual clusters.

The preprocessor then parses the Web news, and eliminates unnecessary words, such as stop-words. After the preprocessing, the source categories are translated into the target language. To study the effectiveness of SVM-BCT, we further interchange the source/destination roles. Suppose the Chines e news categories are originally the source categories. In the role-interchanged experiments, the English news articles will be the source news articles and translated into Ch inese. After the translation process, all the source and target news articles are transformed into SVM vectors for further cross-training classification. 3.2 Parsing and Preprocessing Since each Web news article is composed of plain text and HTML tags, it needs to be parsed first to extract useful information. Although several past studies [13,14] show that considering these HTML tags helps the classification accuracy, the parsing proce-dure is currently designed in a conservative manner by considering only the plain text and ignoring the HTML tags. This issue is left for future study.

Both Chinese and English news articles are preprocessed before they are classified with SVM-BCT. There are four steps for English news articles: (1) tokenization, (2) stop-word removing, (3) stemming, and (4) generation of term-frequency vectors. Be-cause there is no word boundary in Chinese sentences, the Chinese articles need to be segmented first [15,16,17]. We use a hybrid approach proposed in [18] which can achieve a high precision rate and a considerably good recall rate by considering un-known words. The hybrid approach combines a longest match dictionary-based seg-mentation method and a fast keyword/key-phrase extraction algorithm. With this hybrid approach, each sentence is scanned sequentially and the longest matched words based on the dictionary entries are extracted. This process is repeated until all characters are scanned.

When the fast keyword extraction algorithm is executed, the preprocessor collects the occurrence frequencies of the terms to determine whether they are keywords. It first converts the text strings to an ordered list in which each element is either an unseg-mented Chinese character or a segmented word. If there is an English word in the article, it is treated as a segmented word and preprocessed as if it is in an English article. Then the preprocessor will combine two adjacent elements into one longer element if their occurrence frequencies exceed a predefined threshold. If the frequencies of these two terms are not higher enough simultaneously, the term which cannot cross the threshold will be dropped. Therefore, a term is identified as a keyword due to its high-frequency and the low-frequency neighbors. This process is repeated to find all keywords. 3.3 Translation and Transformation After the preprocessing, the Chinese and English news articles in each category are tokenized. Then the Chinese news documents are translated. The translation can be based on a bilingual dictionary or a well-trained machine translation system. In the translation, each Chinese word is translated to a set of English terms which are listed in the bilingual dictionary or derived from the machine translation system. The same procedure is also applied to the English news articles.

Because our framework is constructed based on discriminative SVM classifiers, each news article is converted to a feature vector. For each index term in the feature vector, a weight is associated with the term to e xpress the importance, which could be the term frequency or its influential factor. 3.4 The Cross-Training Process From previous studies on the general Web taxonomy integration problem, we find that if a source article can be integrated into a destination category, there must be a suffi-ciently large semantic overlap between them. This observation is also common for the Web news taxonomy integration problem. If an English/Chinese news category can be associated with a Chinese/English news category, they must be related to the same news event and there is a sufficiently large semantic overlap. Fig. 3 elaborates this relation. The semantic overlap can then be iteratively explored and used in SVM-BCT to en-hance the SVM classifiers. This is the basic concept behind the proposed cross-training approach as shown in Fig. 4. The target news categories (destination taxonomy) are used as the training data sets, and the source news categories (source taxonomy) are used as the testing data sets. The SVM cla ssifiers then calculate the positively mapped ratios as the mapping score ( MS i ) to predict the semantical overlapping. The mapping score MS i of S i  X  D j is defined as follows. For each destination category, the source category with the highest mapping score is predicted as the associative source news category, and vice versa in the cross-training process.
 To get more accurate mapping scores, the classifiers are fine-tuned with cross-training. In the proposed cross-training process, the source news articles are translated into the target language first. All the news articles in the destination taxonomy are then used as the training set to build the first-stage SVM-BCT classifiers. Fig. 5 depicts the detailed process of the cross-training approach. For each destination news category, a source news category is the associative category only i f it has the highest mapping score. This means that they should be related to the same news event and have semantic-overlapped label features which appear in the titles.
 In SVM-BCT, the semantic-overlapped information is explored by first feeding the SVM-BCT classifiers with source news articles as test documents to find the prelim-inary possible mappings. Then we integrate the label information of the associative target category into the feature vectors of each source document to train SVM clas-sifiers for next stage. Each vector comprises three parts: S F , the test output, and S L , where S F is the term features of the source news article, S L is the label features of the source news event, and the test output cont ains the label features of the associative target category. With the predicted mapping information, the discriminative power of the classifiers of the next stage can be enhanced for the source taxonomy.
At the second stage, the augmented feature vectors are used to train source SVM classifiers to fine-tune the exploration of the semantically overlapped information. For controlling the discriminative power of the added semantically overlapped label infor-mation as in [5], the score of the each feature term in the augmented feature vectors can be scaled by a factor of f , and the score of each label feature by a factor of 1  X  f . The parameter f is used to decides the relative wei ghts of the label and term features, and can be tuned for different application environments. In our current prototype, the influence of the parameter f is left for future discussion. The augmented feature vectors are currently calculated for SVM on a TF-IDF basis.

At the third stage, the target term features T F , the target label features T L ,andthe semantically overlapped source label features are used to train the third-stage SVM classifiers. We can then get the fine-tuned classifiers for target categories to obtain the predicted mapping scores. Generally, this cross-training process can be interchangeably continued for several rounds to further fine-tune the SVM classifiers. We have conducted several experiments to compare the performance of SVM-BCT with that of traditional SVM for bilingual Web news taxonomy integration. In the experi-ments, English news taxonomy and Chinese news taxonomy were used as the represen-tatives to demonstrate the classification performance of the proposed SVM-BCT frame-work. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of SVM-BCT is higher than that of trad itional SVM comprehensively. We believe that the proposed framework can be applied to different bilingual environments. 4.1 The Experimental Environment The SVM-BCT framework is currently implemented in Java 5.0 with Eclipse. The seg-mentation corpus is based on the Standard Segmentation Corpus published by the As-sociation for Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing (ACLCLP) [19]. We use SV M light [20] as the SVM tool with a linear kernel.

The bilingual word lists published by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) [21] are the bilingual dictionaries. The Chinese-to-English dictionary ver. 2 (ldc2ce) has about 120 , 000 records, and the English-to-Chinese dictionary (ldc2ec) has about 110 , 000 records. In ldc2ce and ldc2ce, each entry is composed of one single word and several translated words separated by slashes without any indication of the importance. There-fore, the translated words are treated equally in our experiments. 4.2 The Data Sets In our experiments, two news portals were chosen as the bilingual news sources: Google News U.S. version for English news and Google News Taiwan version for Chinese news. Both the Chinese and English news articles were retrieved from the world news category from May 10 to May 23, 2005. The experiments were performed on the data set of each day. Twenty news categories were collected per day. All the English news articles were translated into Chinese with b ilingual dictionaries. The size of the English-to-Chinese data set is 80 . 2 Mbytes. All the Chinese news articles were also translated, and the size of the Chinese-to-English data set is 46 . 9 Mbytes. Both data sets contain 29 , 182 news articles in total.

In the experiments, the mapping relations between the Chinese and English news reports were first identified manually by three graduate students independently. An English news category can be associated with a Chinese news category if at least two students have the same mapping identification. These manually-identified mapping re-lations were used to evaluate the performance of the bilingual integration systems. The experiments were conducted in two ways: Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese. In the Chinese-to-English experiments, the English news taxonomy was first treated as the training set. To find a correspondent Chinese category ( S i )ofanEnglish destination category ( D j ), the news articles in D j were all used as the positive training examples, and the news articles in the other English news categories were used as the negative training examples. Then all mapping scores between English categories and Chinese categories were measured. For each destination English category, the Chinese category with the highest mapping score was considered the associative category. We measured the accuracy performance for each day using the correct mappings as the evaluation data sets, and calculated it by the following equation: which is similar to [4]. Accuracy rather than precision or recall is used because the integration is performed on a category-to-category basis. Apparently, the error rate is the complement of the accuracy. In the English-to-Chinese experiments, the roles of two taxonomies were switched. 4.3 The Results Table 1 lists the experimental results of Chinese-to-English integration and Table 2 lists the experimental results of English-to-Chinese integration. In Table 1, the average ac-curacies are from 46 . 74% to 60 . 87% . SVM-BCT achieves the best accuracy of 66 . 67% , and SVM achieves the best accuracy of 50 . 00% . From Table 1, we can find that SVM-BCT outperforms SVM in 13 days. In Table 2, the average accuracies are from 52 . 17% to 67 . 39% . SVM-BCT achieves the best accuracy of 80 . 00% , and SVM achieves the best accuracy of 62 . 50% . From Table 1 and Table 2, we can find that SVM-BCT out-performs SVM very comprehensively.

In SVM-BCT, label features of the category with the highest mapping score are used to improve the accuracy performance. However, the predicted mapping score may not be correct due to classification errors. Therefore, we use a threshold  X  to control the accuracy. Only if the mapping score is greater than  X  , the category mapping is regarded as a correct mapping. In the experiments, we examined  X  of different values from 0 to 1.0. If  X  =0 , the framework behaves like the original SVM-BCT. If  X  =1 ,the framework behaves like the original SVM. In other cases, the framework filters out the noise information.

Table 3 depicts the results of the Chinese-to-English threshold control and only shows 5 cases. From the results, we can find that the classifiers achieve the best per-formance when  X  =0 . 5 . The experiments of the English-to-Chinese threshold control have the similar results in which the classifiers also achieve the best performance when  X  =0 . 5 . 4.4 Discussion According to the experimental results with SVM-BCT and SVM, the accuracy can be further improved by threshold tuning. We further explored the reasons that hinder the accuracy improvement. From the experiments, we found that the following two issues are very important to the accuracy performance and need to be future studied. First, name entity recognition (NER) is a serious issue because the bilingual dictionaries lack some name entities, such as  X  X asukuni Shrine X , which are common in news articles. Data set Average 60.87% 60.87 66.30% 58.70% 46.74% Because these name entities are excluded from the dictionary, their translations are completely ignored, and the accuracy is thus lowered. Second, in English and Chinese language processing, one word may have different transliterations, especially for the names of people and places. These issues are also left for future study. As the amount of news information explosively grows over the Internet, on-line news services have played an important role to deliver news information to people. Although these Web news portals have provided us ers with integrated monolingual news services, cross-lingual search still has no effective solutions. If a user wants to find some related English news articles from a Chinese news article, she needs to surf English news por-tals and input keywords to query the related news article.

In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual framework with a cross-training approach called SVM-BCT to get high accuracy performance in finding the mapping relation-ships between two news categories in different languages. From the experimental re-sults, we can find that the proposed cross-training approach outperforms the traditional SVM very comprehensively. We believe that the proposed framework can be applied to other bilingual environments.

There are still many research issues left for our future work. For example, feature weighting plays an important role to the system performance. Meaningful features should be explored and employed for integration. In addition, we only consider the ac-curacy rate of correct mappings in current experiments. The correct rejection rate needs to be further studied for non-overlapped source/destination categories. One of the most challenging issues is how to translate new words which are created daily due to the fast changing Web. A better automatic bilingual t ranslation system is needed to fulfill the requirements of effective term translation for the NER problem and the transliteration problem.
