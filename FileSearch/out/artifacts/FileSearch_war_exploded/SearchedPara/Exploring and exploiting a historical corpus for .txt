 Bassam Hammo 1  X  Sane Yagi 2  X  Omaima Ismail 1  X  Mohammad AbuShariah 1 Abstract This paper presents a historical Arabic corpus named HAC. At this early embryonic stage of the project, we report about the design, the architecture and some of the experiments which we have conducted on HAC. The corpus, and accordingly the search results, will be represented using a primary XML exchange format. This will serve as an intermediate exchange tool within the project and will allow the user to process the results offline using some external tools. HAC is made up of Classical Arabic texts that cover 1600 years of language use; the Quranic text, Modern Standard Arabic texts, as well as a variety of monolingual Arabic dic-tionaries. The development of this historical corpus assists linguists and Arabic language learners to effectively explore, understand, and discover interesting knowledge hidden in millions of instances of language use. We used techniques from the field of natural language processing to process the data and a graph-based representation for the corpus. We provided researchers with an export facility to render further linguistic analysis possible. Keywords Historical Arabic corpus  X  Corpus tools  X  Natural language processing  X  Arabic word usage over time  X  Semantic change Many scholars recognize two forms of the Arabic language: Classical Arabic (CA), also known as Quranic Arabic, which is the form of written language used from the sixth century onwards. The other form is Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the contemporary counterpart of CA. Schacht and Bosworth ( 1974 ) consider the date of Napoleon Bonaparte X  X  campaign against Egypt (i.e., circ. 1800 C.E.) to be the start of the modern historical period.

Like other languages, Arabic is influenced by social, cultural, historical, and political factors. It is constantly evolving to accommodate the needs of its speakers as they change over time. Semantic change (also referred to as  X  X emantic shift X ) denotes any change in the sense(s) of a word over the course of time. The historical study of the origin of words and how they developed overtime can be seen as part of etymology and historical linguistics.

The main goal of this study is to demonstrate how semantic change can be studied using information technology tools. Therefore, we propose an XML schema of a historical Arabic corpus, a concordancer to build the corpus automatically, a set of natural language processing (NLP) tools to query the corpus, and a charting tool to facilitate exploration of semantic change overtime. In the second phase of this ongoing project and as the data grows in size, more sophisticated data processing facilities using a database storage enhanced with available information retrieval techniques will be used to offer the users new services which make the search through HAC more pleasant and productive.

We make the corpus and the tools available for researchers and teachers to experiment with. Users can access the historical Arabic corpus through the website of the University of Jordan at ( http://nlp.ju.edu.jo/ ).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides some background about semantic change and previous work in Arabic corpora. In Sect. 3 we give a detailed description of the research methodology we followed in this study. Sections 4 and 5 explain the experimental setting and the conducted experiments respectively. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes our work and draws a roadmap for future research avenues. 2.1 Language change Language never ceases to change. So long as it is spoken by a community, it changes phonetically, morphologically, syntactically, and semantically. In an extreme case of language change, one language may, in fact, evolve out of another over an extended period of time. Historical linguistics uses a set of procedures to verify whether certain languages are related and to determine how they evolved out of their common ancestor. It has revealed, for instance, that Arabic, Akkadian, Hebrew, Syriac, and Ge X  X z evolved out of one language called Semitic. 2.2 Arabic corpora The first task in studying Arabic lexicography is to compile a corpus (Alansary et al. 2007 , 2008 ). Research in Arabic corpora appeared in the late 1980s. Most corpora at that time were commercial and expensive. Advancement in computer hardware and software, Arabic-enabled text editors, and sophistication in NLP gave research on the Arabic language a big boost. This, however, did not resolve problems such as the scarcity of digitized content. Furthermore, when digitized content was made available it was heavily biased towards specific genres, e.g., religious discourse. This can cause problems in corpus representativeness and balance. There is concerted effort to digitize major classical works in a wide range of fields. The following are examples of Arabic corpora that were compiled for experimentation purposes.

Al-Sulaiti and Atwell ( 2006 ) described a corpus of contemporary Arabic. Their corpus included MSA texts and samples of colloquial varieties. The purpose of this corpus was to enrich resources for teaching and researching Arabic. The corpus contained one million words marked up with XML; texts were collected from multiple resources, mainly magazines, newspapers, websites, and radio stations. The XML schema they used contained metadata tags, general tags of information about the compiled texts; there were no morphological information or part of speech tags.
Hajjar et al. ( 2010 ) proposed an improved and progressive structured electronic dictionary for the Arabic language (iSPEDAL). Unlike other flat text dictionaries, iSPEDAL can be presented in either a relational database or an XML document which can be easily exploited with the help of a suitable query language. The proposed structure contains distinct data: roots, affixes, patterns, and derived words, with all words linked to their roots.
 Attia et al. ( 2011 ) also used MSA corpora to build a lexicon encoded in Lexical Markup Framework (LMF). Their model was developed for automatically gaining lexical information from corpora text to construct a large lexical resource. They provided a complete description of inflectional and syntactic behavior of Arabic lexical entries and built a lexicon for MSA using contemporary Arabic with sufficient syntactic information. Also, they developed a web system called AraConLex to experiment with the corpus.

The Quranic Arabic Corpus (Dukes and Habash 2010 ) has an annotated corpus of the Quranic script including morphological segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis that utilizes dependency grammar. The corpus was automatically annotated using Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (Buck-walter 2004 ) succeeded by manual verification. The corpus is available for download in both XML and plain text format.

Boella et al. ( 2011 ) proposed SALAH, which is a model for segmenting and linguistically analyzing the Arabic script of Prophet Muhammad X  X  traditions (hadieth). The system splits each script into: transmitters X  chain ( sanad ) and text content ( matn ). The system outputs an XML structure that contains relations among transmitters and a lemmatized text corpus that is used in the automatic generation of concordance texts. They suggested that the system be used for information retrieval from hadieth scripts and for verifying relations among transmitters.
 Another research on the Quranic Corpus, QurAna, presented by Sharaf and Atwell ( 2012 ), tagged the scripts with personal pronouns and antecedents. QurAna provides an online visualization tool with which users can query a certain verse to get all the pronouns associated with it together with their antecedents and concepts. Users can also explore a concept from retrieved data to get all Quranic verses that have the same meaning.
 Hammo et al. ( 2013 ) described a corpus and a set of tools for experimenting with Contemporary Arabic. The corpus was compiled from editorials of newspapers collected from different countries, constitutions of Arab countries, sports news, technology news, political news, dictionaries, and the Holy Quran. 2.3 Historical corpora HAC was inspired by research on historical corpora for English and other languages. Table 1 shows a sample of historical corpora for the English language. There are a few of such corpora that contain samples of texts from earlier periods of English in use (Rayson et al. 2007 ). These corpora are used to study, inter alia, language variation in earlier periods of English, in addition to language change and development.

The new Helsinki Corpus of English Texts ( 2011 ) was annotated in XML. It is a structured multi-genre diachronic corpus, which includes periodically organized text samples from three major time periods: Old, Middle and Early Modern English. Old and Early Middle English texts are grouped into century-long subsections; later Middle English and Early Modern English are divided into sub-periods of 70 or 80 years (cf. Table 2 ). The periods and sub-periods are not of equal size because the number and quality of available texts varies considerably between periods. Accordingly, the amount of text representing a certain genre may be too small to support conclusions and is considered disadvantageous. To overcome the lack of symmetry, the types of Helsinki texts have been grouped into larger categories called diachronic text prototypes as depicted in Table 3 .

Another example of historical English corpora is ARCHER ( 2014 ). It is a multi-genre corpus of British and American English compiled in XML by a consortium led by Manchester University; it has about 3.3 million words and covers the period of 1600 X 1999. Historical corpora were also attempted for other languages (Piotrowski 2012 ), these include: German (Pilz et al. 2008 ), Icelandic (Ro  X  gn-valdsson and Helgado  X  ttir 2008 ) and Spanish (Sa  X  nchez-Marco et al. 2010 ) to mention but a few.

For the Arabic language, there are no published historical corpora that we are aware of. The closest to a historical corpus are two: King Saud University Corpus of Classical Arabic (KSUCCA) and King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) Arabic corpus. According to Alrabiah et al. ( 2013 ), KSUCCA is a general purpose corpus that restricts itself to only pure CA texts that date back to the period from pre-Islamic times until 1100 C.E.; i.e., it does not encompass the life span of Arabic. It makes claims to representativeness and balance but there is little evidence to that. KACST Arabic corpus, on the other hand, is a general purpose, monolingual resource that includes Classical as well as MSA texts from pre-Islamic times until the present. Al-Thubaity ( 2014 ) asserts that it has been  X  X esigned and created to overcome the limitations of existing Arabic corpora... It is carefully sampled, and its contents are classified based on time, region, medium, domain, and topic X  (p. 1). To rectify its current state of representativeness and balance, Al-Thubaity says,  X  X t is planned to increase the corpus size [currently 750 million words] to 1 billion words, and all necessary efforts will be taken to bridge the gap between the design and actual collection of texts across time periods, mediums, domains, and topics X  (p. 30).

A historical Arabic corpus that represents the full range of this language X  X  history will allow linguists to investigate systematically the evolution of grammatical, phonological, lexical change and usage over time. In the next section, we describe the framework for a structured XML schema that was used to represent our ideas for building a historical Arabic corpus. 3.1 A processing outline for the XML corpus In this section, we describe the detailed structure of the Arabic XML schema and the processing outline of the historical Arabic corpus. XML is an open standard for annotating text elements by including meaningful symbols (tags) that communicate to the reader what each recorded data element is used for Ide et al. ( 2000 ).
XML structure is readable by both computers and humans. It is well recognized that searching an XML corpus gets slower as it grows in size, but its portability and accessibility by text editors are attractions that cannot be missed. The final structure of the XML schema is described in Sect. 3.2 . 3.1.1 Document pre-processing This is the first step in converting an input document D into the XML structure. It has the following automated steps: 1. Convert D to UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a universal encoding that can represent 2. For each D i , when available, we retrieve the following information: document
The category element could have one of two possible values: (a) Primary source: It refers to a document written or created during the period (b) Secondary source: It is a document whose language does not faithfully 3.1.2 Word pre-processing For a given word w in D i (excluding stop-words), we apply a set of processes to extract these pieces of information: the word itself, its location within the text of the document, root, pattern, part of speech, and its stem. The following sub-sections explain how the information about a word is extracted and outputted to the XML file. 3.1.2.1 Tokenization The tokenization process takes the input document D i and splits it into separate words. We designed and implemented a tokenizer to extract words at multiple delimiters including (white spaces, tabs and punctuation marks). The output of the tokenizer is of two types: tokens that correspond to units whose characters are recognizable (such as punctuation marks, numeric data, dates, etc.) and tokens that need further morphological analysis. Tokens of one-character length were ignored and excluded from the XML file. 3.1.2.2 Stop-word removal Stop-words are also called function or grammatical words. These can be lexical words that got grammaticalized; i.e., they lost some of their semantic content to serve a grammatical function. Historical linguists would value stop-words more than computational linguists would; Ko  X  nig and Siemund ( 1999 ) claims that,  X  X he semantic development of such function words does not only reveal some general tendencies of semantic change within a particular language, but also allows cross-linguistic generalizations to be made about typical source and target domains and possible directions of change X , p. 238. Developers of NLP applications remove stop-words from search engine indices as this removal reduces the size of indices dramatically (Salton and Buckley 1988 ; Yang 1995 ); hence, this will improve recall and precision. Nelson and Kuc  X  era ( 1982 ) found that the 10 most frequently occurring words in English typically account for 20 X 30 % of the tokens in a document. In the context of Arabic historical corpora, however, most function words have hardly changed in the past sixteen documented centuries of Arabic. We compiled, therefore, a list of common stop-words that we did not annotate in the XML schema for the sake of speeding up search processes when the XML file grows in size. The list includes function words and low-content words that are of high frequency. 3.1.2.3 Stemming Stemming is the task of mapping several words onto one base form. Stemming increases similarities between word forms that are derivatives of the same root. Stemming uses morphological heuristics to remove affixes (prefixes and suffixes) from words before indexing them. Take the example word,  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  wakaatabouhum  X  X nd they corresponded with them X . A stemmer would return kaataba as a stem, the three consonants, KTB , as a root, and the Pattern III which is schematically represented by the variable set of consonants: Cv:CC or Fa:MaLa (F for first consonant, M for medial, and L for Last).

Arabic stemming is more complicated by comparison with English. Major words of the Arabic language are primarily constructed from three-consonant roots by following a set of morphological patterns. Patterns attach prefixes, infixes, and/or suffixes to root radicals and often carry number, gender, and tense grammatical marking. An Arabic stemmer, for example, should identify the string,  X   X   X   X  kaatib subscription X , as belonging to one root,  X   X   X  KTB  X  X o write X .
 We adapted an Arabic stemmer that was originally implemented by Khoja and Garside ( 1999 ). It extracted roots but did not return stems and patters, so we modified it such that it would extract for a word w its root, morphological pattern, and stem. Studies in information retrieval found that stemming outperforms root extraction in retrieving documents (Hammo et al. 2004 ; Hammo 2009 ). In general, to extract an Arabic root from a word w , the root-based stemmer benefits from a set of data files, such as determiners, common prefixes, common suffixes, a lexicon of proper nouns, morphological patterns, valid roots, etc., then it processes each word w on the basis of the algorithm shown in Table 4 . 3.1.2.4 Part of speech tagging (POST) A part-of-speech tagger (POST) is a software application that reads text in a particular language and assigns to each word its part of speech; i.e., it marks it as noun, verb, adjective, etc. Part of speech tagging is an essential process in understanding how sentences are formed from small constituents. It is mainly used in syntactic and semantic analysis of sentences. To assign part of speech tags (POSTs) to words, we modified the input encoding to UTF-8 Arabic script then we used the Stanford 1 tagger (Toutanova et al. 2003 ). The tagger is an open source package written in the Java programming language and in addition to the two trained tagger models for English, the full package has tagger models for Arabic, Chinese French and German. 3.2 Final XML schema The final XML schema constitutes the core of the Arabic historical corpus system; it offers annotations for each processed document as well as morphological annotation for each word in that document. The corpus is accessed through the concordance. Figure 1 , shows the final structure of the XML schema, where the metadata (title, author, year, era, category, genre, etc.) appear at the top of the XML schema followed by the document content. This would have annotation for each word in the document (see the insert at the bottom of Fig. 1 for details). 4.1 Concordancer A concordancer is an automated tool to build a linguistic concordance for purposes of experimentation with a natural language. Some examples of Arabic concor-dancers include aConCorde (Roberts et al. 2006 ) and AraConc (Abbe ` s and Dichy 2008 ). In this research, we developed a concordancer (c.f. Fig. 2 ) which consists of a set of modules for processing the compiled documents and building the Arabic historical corpus. It is not the primary objective of this research to design and implement a concordancer, but rather to provide a set of tools that are capable of building the Arabic historical corpus and encoding it in XML. All of this is for the end goal of helping researchers, linguists, and students of Arabic to experiment with the corpus and to better understand the semantic change that Arabic words and structures underwent over time. In the following section, we shed light on the development of the historical Arabic corpus and then we demonstrate the utility of the resources we developed by citing some experimental queries we carried out. 4.2 Dataset Over the years, it has been proven that extracting linguistic information from sizable and reliable corpora is crucial to effective processing of natural languages. The development of concordances, information retrieval applications, and natural language tools for Arabic requires the availability of very large and reliable Arabic corpora. Unfortunately, historical Arabic corpora for research purposes are not free of charge and are virtually impossible to find. Most of the experimentation with the Arabic language has been conducted on small, manually collected texts (Abu-Salem et al. 1999 ; Hammo et al. 2002 ). One major difficulty in obtaining reliable research results in Arabic language processing is due to the lack of availability of reliable data for experimentation purposes; therefore, it is unclear to the research community how experimental findings can be scaled up.

To make understanding of semantic shift overtime easier, we compiled our own historical corpus and named it HAC, the historical Arabic corpus using the tools that we developed here. It is planned for this corpus to include all primary CA text material that is available on the internet. We know this is overly ambitious, but we believe it can be done with systematic effort and genuine commitment. So far, we have been able to compile 45,000,000 tokens from all historical eras.

Arabic literary historians have divided the periods of Arabic literature into eras based on changes in religious, political, and social history of the Arab region from pre-Islamic times to the modern period (Hourani 2013 ). At this stage of development, we have collected data that spans different sixteen centuries. Although we are still at the beginning of a long term project, we intend to enrich the content of this embryonic corpus using the automated tools that we developed and adapted. Table 5 , shows traditionally recognized eras that HAC covers.
The first column represents the names of the historical eras as identified by Arab literary historians. The second column represents the time span in the Muslim lunar calendar (Hijra) and the corresponding Common Era calendar. The third is the era tags in our corpus HAC; we decided to abandon the Hijra calendar and used instead the Common Era reference because most contemporary Arabic-speakers relate better to the latter. Furthermore, we thought it would be more appropriate to adopt a century time span because all historical eras would be equal; therefore, historical progression would become more comprehensible. Figure 3 shows the composition of HAC in terms of historical eras. 4.3 Genres We adopted the following set of genres for the classification of texts in the corpus: literary prose, poetry, history, philosophy, religion, science, thought, and dictionaries. The motivation for this classification is that the Arabic content from Pre-Islamic times until the nineteenth century falls into these broad categories. Any finer classification would make the corpus heavily imbalanced. It is intended to balance the corpus across these genres by adding more content as it gets digitized. Figure 4 shows the present composition of HAC in terms of genres.

As it stands, HAC is currently unbalanced and unrepresentative of the genres and eras it is meant to depict. By representativeness of the corpus it is meant that it includes a wide range of text that is produced in the language. Representativeness depends on two factors: (1) a balanced range of genres, which is necessary for studying language change and (2) a sampling technique for the inclusion of texts within a genre. It is because of the lack of sufficient quantities of digitized historical Arabic text (manuscripts and early prints) that the HAC is currently unrepresen-tative and unbalanced. It is our ambition to create sub-corpora that are both representative and balanced. Table 6 shows HAC composition in words. 4.4 Benefits of HAC and its tools 4.4.1 Bene fi ts for language learning Despite the transitional nature of the current state of HAC, Arabic language education can benefit from it and from the tools associated with it in two major ways: material development and classroom instruction. Prior to any language textbook development, a number of decisions have to be taken as to the topics to be covered and the level of depth and sophistication. HAC is useful in providing the material developer with some guidance as to the frequency of words, roots, and morphological patterns. Textbooks that are not guided by a corpus perspective would not be able to discriminate between high and low frequency vocabulary, roots, morphological patterns, and grammatical structures. Furthermore, they could be pitched at a level higher than targeted learners because of the language used to discuss concepts.

The concordancer associated with HAC is capable of creating a word frequency list for each era and for each genre. Perhaps a list would not depict a fully faithful view of language use at a particular era or in a certain genre due to HAC X  X  problems of balance, yet it is capable of capturing general trends of language use. This is certainly superior to the current state of material development where authors grope in the dark as far as the range of vocabulary to use in their textbooks is concerned.
Furthermore, deciding the morphology content of textbooks is currently guided by tradition rather than by language use. HAC X  X  concordancer can reveal the degree of prevalence of the various morphological patterns and, therefore, point to the less frequent ones so that they could be given less importance or avoided altogether in some school grades. The use of this concordancer can easily indicate, inter alia, that  X  X ecame cross-eyed X ) are not productive morphological patterns; therefore, they should not be taught at school level. The concordance will also reveal that roots with two semivowels, whether separated or unseparated by a consonant are not frequent in the language; therefore, the complex derivational and conjugational rules taught to school children about these two types of roots are not warranted by authentic language use.

Classroom instruction can benefit from HAC as it promotes learning by discovery. Data-driven approaches to language learning would use HAC X  X  concordancer to lead the Arabic learner to observe authentic patterns of use that could normally go unnoticed. With Key Word in Context lists that the concordancer produces, it becomes easy for the learner to notice that  X   X   X  kaana  X  X as/were X , for instance, is almost always followed by a noun and that this noun is almost always marked by the case markers  X   X  u,  X   X   X  uwna, or  X   X   X  aani . Discovery learning is superior to spoon-feeding that is used in traditional teaching approaches. 4.4.2 Bene fi ts for linguistic analysis HAC might offer a new perspective on the Arabic language or could complement traditional linguistic analysis and thus add a new dimension to the study of language. The authentic examples that HAC offers to the linguist facilitate description of Arabic as used by real life speakers rather than grammarians and morphologists. HAC is capable of showing frequencies, phrase structures, and collocations in the form of concordances; hence, it makes it easy for the linguist to quickly inspect the context and to even examine the larger discourse context of a particular lexeme, morphological pattern, or grammatical structure. This relieves the linguist from having to spend time and energy searching and motivates them to observe and to analyze patterns and trends of language use.

HAC can be used for corpus-based as well as corpus-driven investigations. It has been purpose built for the study of lexical, morphological, syntactic, and semantic change across time, yet it is useful for lexicography as it supplies authentic rather than artificial instances of language use. It reveals word usage that might escape the notice of the lexicographer. HAC lends itself to not only diachronic but also synchronic language variation studies; as it facilitates context-sensitive description of language use. It also makes it possible for the linguist to study across time and genre patterns of use that are motivated by ideology. Even though HAC has not been designed purposefully for synchronic analysis, it still can be used for forensic investigations of document authorship as well as lexical, grammatical, and discoursal pattern discovery; study of the relationship between social and linguistic variables (age, gender, or social class); and comparison of language varieties in terms of professions.
 5.1 Experiment I: semantic change in the Arabic language The following line of poetry by Jamil Buthaina from the seventh century reflects the semantic change that the word  X   X   X   X  raa2i3 underwent:
The word  X   X   X   X  raa2i3 in this line of poetry means  X  X wful X  and  X  X errible X . In modern Arabic contexts, this word developed the opposite meaning,  X  X onderful X  and  X  X eautiful X . Similarly, the word  X   X   X   X  sha6ir in the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries used to mean  X  X on-artist X ,  X  X ly X ,  X  X eceitful X , or  X  X reacherous X . Now, in Contemporary Arabic, this word means  X  X anny X  and  X  X lever X , which again shows that it has drifted from its original meaning. Table 7 is based on automatically extracted phrases from HAC. It shows some examples of semantic shift that inspection has revealed.

Table 8 shows an n -gram sample of contexts of the word  X   X   X   X  jihaaz across time that reflects its historical semantic development. To demonstrate the potential of the charting tool, Fig. 5 shows a view of the relative frequency of the same word, jihaaz, in relation to the sub-corpus of the various eras. Had the present development stage of HAC been strictly balanced, this relative frequency would have signaled that the word underwent linguistic change and required, therefore, closer inspection.
Figure 6 depicts the historical development of four Arabic words across. The word  X   X   X   X   X   X  irhaab underwent semantic pejoration (degradation) gaining a new negative meaning. The old meaning was  X  X ntimidate and deter aggressors X , while the new meaning in modern contexts is  X  X tartling X  or  X  X ssaulting the innocent X . The word  X   X   X   X   X  siyasa  X  X ustodianship X  also gained in modern contexts the new meaning of  X  X olitics X . The word  X   X   X   X  shatir underwent semantic amelioration (elevation) 9u3look underwent degradation overtime,  X  X andit X  changed to  X  X auper X .

A question that may arise is why words gain higher frequency in some eras than in others. Let X  X  use the four example words in Fig. 6 to answer this question. Irhab started to be used more frequently in the eighteenth century than before when it acquired the pejorative sense of  X  X errorism X . The eighteenth century witnessed the beginning of Western interest in the colonization of Arabic-speaking countries; hence, siyasa became strikingly more frequent in the twentieth century when  X  X olitics X  became an inhibition of Arabic speakers as they resisted European colonization and began to use politics for negotiating their independence. Shatir and 9u3look , on the other hand, fluctuated in frequency but remained across the historical eras without any notable contrast in use. The pre-Islamic era, however, witnessed relatively higher frequency of use of 9u3look but lower frequency of shatir . This could be a reflection of social culture; the state of being 9u3look  X  X agnanimous bandit who stole from the rich and gave to the poor X  was celebrated at pre-Islamic times, so much so that some poets would take pride in it, whilst the state of being shatir  X  X on-artist X  was not celebrated at all. At the same time, the skill that con-artists exhibit was admired in the middle ages, a fact that caused the semantic amelioration of  X  X anny and clever X  that shatir connotes in some contemporary colloquial Arabic dialects. It could, thus, be claimed that pejoration and amelioration result in part from native speakers X  change in social attitude towards what words mean. 5.2 Experiment II: a diachronic investigation of the root  X   X   X  ThQF In this experiment, we show a diachronic investigation of one root,  X   X   X  ThQF that is aimed at demonstrating the type of research that can be carried out in historical semantics.
 To begin with, Table 9 lists the entries of this root X  X  verb derivatives and Table 10 lists the noun derivatives in five dictionaries that are hundreds of years apart. The top box in this table contains the verb derivatives, whilst the bottom box has the noun and adjective derivatives. Each entry appears in one row and each dictionary in one column; the purpose is to show when each entry appeared in language use and when it disappeared on the authority of the dictionaries concerned. In Tables 9 and 10 , the entry  X  X  X  denotes absence of the entry in the relevant dictionary. Notice that the eighth century witnessed only one verb form thaqifa ,but the eleventh century witnessed three verb forms: thaqifa , thaqufa , and thaqqafa . Clearly, the latter two verb forms were introduced between 786 and 1004 C.E. Notice also that thaqifa continued to be the verb of choice for sixteen centuries. Linguists can draw many morphology-related conclusions from Tables 9 and 10 but we will move on to demonstrate how to study the semantic change that this root underwent.

We searched for the root ThQF in HAC and extracted more than 10,000 instances of use. Focusing on one historical era at a time, we took stock of the morphological patterns that were actually used in the corpus and verified to what extent dictionaries reflected authentic language use. Then we studied the collocates of each instance of the root X  X  derivatives to establish its senses within the era under investigation. After that, we checked whether or not the relevant dictionary listed these senses. We moved across the sixteen centuries of documented Arabic use in the same manner and studied the relationship between the senses of this root X  X  derivatives and compared them to senses of the root in such Semitic languages as Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, Nabataean, South Arabic, Assyrian, and Akkadian. Some of the conclusions of this investigation were as follows.

All senses of the root X  X  derivatives related to the basic notion of  X  X trength X  that is shared with the seven Semitic languages. Before 600 C.E., the verb used was thaqifa  X  X ound, got, seized X , but in the 800 X  X  the verb form thaqqafa was introduced to carry the sense of  X  X efine, rectify, set right X . In the 900 X  X , this new verb form acquired the meaning of  X  X trengthen X , then in the 1400 X  X  it started to mean  X  X amper X . The verb form tathaqqafa was introduced in the 900 X  X  with the sense of  X  X earned X , but then it developed in the eleventh century to mean  X  X mproved, perfected X . Nouns and adjectives had a similar history. We will cite only one example: muthaqqaf .This noun/adjective morphological form was introduced before 600 C.E. with the sense of  X  X rrow X  and  X  X traightened X  but it developed in the 1200 X  X  to acquire the sense of  X  X ortified X , in the 1300 X  X  the sense of  X  X anacled X , in the 1400 X  X   X  X rnate X  and  X  X lender X , and in the twenty-first century the sense of  X  X ultured X . Although these senses may appear to some to be unrelated, they are at a higher conceptual level connected. Power and strength have to be exercised for something to be found and seized. Strength is also required for refining, rectifying, and setting things right; and when things are refined, rectified, and set right, they become strong. Improving and perfecting result in strengthening and vice versa. An arrow is strong and strength is required to produce ornate and slender things. For something to be manacled, power has to be exercised, etc. These are but few conclusions that can be drawn from a research that used HAC. For details, see Yagi and Ghodhaya ( 2014 ). We have attempted to demonstrate how the tools we developed can be used to trace the changes that Arabic words went through over time. We developed an XML schema for a historical Arabic corpus. We developed tools to compile the historical corpus automatically and a concordancer to experiment with it. The main objective of the research has been the development of HAC and the design and adaptation of the tools that would facilitate querying it. The ultimate goal was to better understand the semantic change that the Arabic language went through. We have conducted some experiments that explored the data in our corpus. The results reveal important knowledge about semantic shifts that can be extracted.

This work is still at an embryonic stage and has a long way to go. The corpus, concordance, and tools have been made available to graduate students and researchers at the Linguistics Department, The University of Jordan for the purpose of continuing to compile data in this corpus ( http://nlp.ju.edu.jo/ ).
We suggest that the corpus-building and corpus-querying tools be refined and optimized. We plan to use a sophisticated database enhanced with information retrieval techniques to offer the users new services which make the search more productive. Also we recommend that linguists and teachers of Arabic utilize HAC and benefit from what it has got to offer.
