 Cryptography, Information Theory, and Error-Correction a Handbook for the 21st Century, Aiden A. Bruen, Mario A. Forcinito. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (2005). $95, ISBN: 0-471-65317-9
Cryptography is an exciting field of knowledge that deals with secure transmission of data on public chan-nels. It has found many applications in the digital era and has attracted some of the greatest minds of the world. Many good books on cryptography and cryptographic protocol are available and more are being writ-ten. The field of information theory is also very important and highly applicable area. As pointed out by
Thomas M. Cover and Joy A. Thomas in their famous book, Elements of Information Theory , that informa-tion theory is all about computing ultimate compression and computing maximum possible data rates on a communication channel. The theory of error-correcting codes deals with the error free transmission of messages on noisy channels. Therefore, all the three fields, obviously, deal with transmission of messages and are interrelated.

Cryptography, Information Theory and Error-Correction is an excellent introduction to the three interrelated fields. As pointed out in its preface, the book is intended to provide a complete but highly accessible account of the three subjects and their interconnection . The presentation of the material by Bruen and Forcinito is very attractive and easy to follow. It is infact highly accessible even for an undergraduate student. The book contains 24 chapters and is naturally divided into three parts, one each for the three main topics.
The first eight chapters discuss the basics of cryptography and constitute the first part of the book. The next nine chapters are devoted to the discussion of information theory and its applications and the last 7 chapters contain the theory of error correcting codes and the algorithm proposed by the authors.

Part I of the book starts with a brief introduction of cryptography and the biography of Claude E. Shan-non, and it then goes on describing the classical enciphering techniques (like Caesar and Vigenere ciphers), symmetric key and public key cryptosystems (like RSA, DES and AES), different security protocols (like
SSL, PGP and GPG), the ideas of digital signatures, hash functions, key exchange and key management sys-tems like Kerberos. Elliptic curve cryptography and different cryptanalysis techniques are also included in this part. This section ends with a brief discussion of some practical issues, including technical, commercial and legal aspects in the development of practical systems.

First 5 chapters in this part are very well written. The authors have demonstrated good presentation and teaching skills in these chapters. The description of RSA in chapter 3, DES rounds in chapter 4 and AES transformations in chapter 4 are interesting and easy to follow. Although a complete chapter is devoted for
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) but the treatment of various uses of ECC is not as detailed. Given that most of the resent research in mathematics went into the study of elliptic curves (as described by the authors in the book) the material given in this chapter is very brief. Most of the chapter is devoted to describing the group structure provided by the elliptic curves and in introducing the details of arithmetic operations defined on an elliptic curve.

Like ECC, a full chapter is devoted to the description of cryptanalysis techniques. Given that cryptanalysis is one of the most interesting parts of cryptography, the level of detail given in this chapter does not seem to be sufficient. The presentation of these techniques could be strengthened by giving more practical and detailed explanation of these techniques.

In general, part one of the book is a good introduction to the field of cryptography and provides a superb start to the readers. This part of the book can be regarded as a very good introduction to the field of cryptography but cannot be called a complete account of the field as was intended. Many aspects of crypto-systems including the complexity considerations, randomized algorithms and attacks etc. need to be discussed in much more detail before we can call it a complete account of the subject.

The second part of the book, consisting of the next eight chapters, introduces Information Theory. First two chapters in this section establish the idea of entropy as a measure of information, randomness, and uncer-tainty. The introduction is both comprehensive and is supported by suitable and interesting examples, such as the number of yes/no questions to determine the defective weight out of 12 weights. The ideas of a typical sequence, joint and conditional entropy and mutual information are very well explained. The interpretation of theorems is really interesting [e.g. the interpretation of H ( X / Y ) 6 H ( X )], and the comment that processing of side information cannot increase mutual information are both intuitive and interesting. Such explanation of mathematical results is attractive and gives a good insight into the subject. The proofs of different results, in-cluded in this section, are easy to follow. The only odd section in these two chapters is the section Number
Bases, Erdos and the Hand of God which, though interesting, seems to be a misplaced topic. The results of this topic need to be explicitly linked with the remaining sequence of results.

In the next three chapters the authors mainly explain the core information theory including the ideas of source coding, data compression, channels and their characteristic and capacity, signal sampling and SNR, coding gain, Ergodic sources and Markov sources. The material presented in these chapters is an excellent introduction to the area and is supported with many attractive examples like the example on redundancy of language stating that human being only read the first and the last character of a word and all characters in between may appear in any order. The ideas in this section are presented well for example the formulation of the idea of block codes is excellent. The explanation of Lempel-Ziv coding using the example and the opti-mality of Huffman coding are other nice examples of the easy to follow style of presentation of the authors.
Overall this part of the book is excellently written by the authors and is comparable to any standard work available.

As the main reason for combining the three topics in one book is the interconnection between the areas the next two chapters provide some results highlighting the interconnection between cryptography, information theory and error-correction. The chapter Perfect Security: the New Paradigm is a very short but important chapter of the section as it formally presents the link between cryptography and information theory. It in-cludes a description of perfect security and uses information theory to justify some results relating the size of message space, cipher space and key space. The reasoning given to prove that for perfect security the size of key space must be larger than the size of message space and the result that for perfect security all keys must have the same probability of being chosen are very interesting and intuitive.

The important ideas of Latin squares and abstract explanation of perfect security are well written and are easy to follow. Overall this chapter provides a glimpse at the link between the two fields. Some results using concepts from both cryptography and information theory have been presented in this chapter.
The chapter Shift Registers ( LSFR ) and Stream Ciphers talks about the basic working of shift registers, an-other topic that emphasis the interconnection of the areas. In this chapter, the authors also mention the use of shift registers in the fields of cryptography for generating pseudorandom sequences and their use in coding.

It is important to note here that not much information theory (only the ideas of entropy and mutual infor-mation) has been used to justify the results given in these chapters. In addition, the three areas using shift reg-isters is not a very strong reason for combining the three areas in one book. After all, the reason for combining the three subjects in one book must be much stronger than the fact that results of one subject are used to jus-tify the results in the other or that some common methods are used in each of the three areas. In such a case, only the relevant part of the subject could be included. For example, if only the first two chapters of part 2 are needed to explain the results of part one then why do the authors include chapters 11 X 14 in this book? As the link between the three fields is much stronger, so the authors must include much more material for explicitly explaining the interconnection of the areas. The last chapter of this section, The Genetic Code , is a nice application of information theory and coding.
The introduction given in this chapter is very brief. It is right that this chapter provides a pointer to an attrac-tive application; however, the introduction is too brief and commences an altogether new application area. It seems that detailed example (and not just an introduction) from coding/communication theory could have been a better example at this point. Like part one of the book, this section is a very good introduction to the field of information theory with theory being supported with many solved examples and well designed exercises. Again, though, we cannot regard it to be a complete account of the field.

The third part of the book is on error-correcting codes. A general comment about this section is that like the other two sections it is well written and is a very good introduction to the area of error-correction. Unlike the other sections, it is very dense and presents many results in very little space. It provides an excellent intro-duction to linear codes, specially Reed-Solomon codes, and generalization of linear codes to MDS codes. The link between error-correction and cryptography is mentioned several times but mostly pointers to examples and results are provided. The material presented in the last three chapters is very dense but very interesting.
The authors own work presented in the last chapter is interesting but relatively difficult to follow. One final comment about the last section is that at times it introduces (without giving much detail) a very interesting example and then gives a reference to the related work which, sometimes, is annoying as the example really demands more details.
 In general, this book, easily, is one of the best introductions to the three fascinating areas of Cryptography,
Information Theory, and Error-Correction with some emphasis on the interconnection between the three areas. The book achieves most of the goals set by the authors. In most parts of the book, the reader is provided with very interesting examples and well designed problems. Most parts of the book are easy to follow and can be read independently. The book may be a very useful reference for the courses mentioned in the preface of the book. We can hope that the authors will provide more results emphasizing the interconnection of the three areas in future additions of the book and include more aspects of cryptography to make it a complete account of at least one main field of study.
