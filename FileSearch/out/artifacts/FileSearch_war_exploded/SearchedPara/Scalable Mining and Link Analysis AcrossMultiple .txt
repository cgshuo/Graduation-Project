 Although very useful, multi-relational data mining faces two major challenges. First, it is more difficult to model multi-relational data. Unlike tuples in a single table which can be modelled by vectors, multi-relational data contains hetero-geneous objects and relationships among them, and there has not been widely accepted model for mining such data. Second, many data mining approaches aim at finding a model (or hypothesis) that fits the data. In a relational database, the number of possible models is much larger than that in a single table. For example, in rule-based multi-relational classification, each rule is associated with a join path. If each relation is joinable with two other relations on average, there are 2 k +1  X  1 join paths of length no greater than k . Thus it is more complicated or at least more time consuming to search for good models in relational databases. The main purpose of my thesis is to study the application of data mining technology in multi-relational environments. Because most real-world relational databases have compli-cated schemas and contain huge amounts of data, efficiency and scalability become our major concerns as well as the accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithms. In my the-sis step-by-step developments are made for multi-relational data mining. Figure 1 shows a road map of our work. There are mainly two types of multi-relational information that are widely used for data mining: Neighbor objects (objects linked to each object through certain join paths) and link-ages between objects. These two types of information are complementary for each other, as neighbor objects represent the contexts of objects, and linkages indicate relationships between objects. We propose new methods for efficiently ac-quiring both types of information, which are Tuple ID Prop-agation [1] for finding neighbor objects in each relation, and Path decomposition [4] for finding all linkages between two objects efficiently.
 Based on Tuple ID Propagation, we propose CrossMine [1], a highly efficient and scalable approach for multi-relational classification. Then we move to multi-relational clustering, which is a more sophisticated problem as no pre-defined classes are given. We propose CrossClus [2], which can uti-lize user guidance and perform efficient clustering. Based on linkage information, we propose Relom , a new approach for duplicate detection using linkages between objects. We invent LinkClus [3], a new approach for linkage-based simi-larity analysis and clustering. Because neighbor objects and linkages are two complementary types of information, it is very helpful to combine both of them in data mining tasks. Finally, we extended our multi-relational data mining frame-work to truth validation (also known as veracity analysis ) on the web. Since multiple information providers on the web may provide conflicting information about the same entity, it is necessary to provide trustable analysis of the truthful-ness of information from multiple information providers and automatically identify the correct information. We designed a general framework, called TruthFinder [5] for resolving con-flictive information provided by multiple sources, based on the heuristic that an information provider is trustworthy if it provides many pieces of true information, and a piece of information is likely to be true if it is provided by many trust-worthy web sites . The method links information providers, stated facts on different entities, and the corresponding enti-ties, into a heterogeneous information network, and consol-idates the trustworthiness by an iterative enhancement pro-cess with weight-propagation and consolidation across this network. In one of our experiments TruthFinder successfully finds the true set of authors and the trustable information providers based on the conflicting book author information provided by multiple sources.
