 With the increasing accessibility of transactional data in venture finance, venture capital firms (VCs) face great chal-lenges in developing quantitative tools to identify new in-vestment opportunities. Recommendation techniques have the possibility of helping VCs making data-driven invest-ment decisions by providing an automatic screening process of a large number of startups across different domains on the basis of their past investment data. A previous study has shown the potential advantage of using collaborative fil-tering to catch and predict the VCs X  investment behaviours [17]. However, two fundamental challenges in venture fi-nance make conventional recommendation techniques diffi-cult to apply. First, risk factors should be cautiously con-sidered when making investments: for a potential startup, a VC needs to specifically estimate how well this new invest-ment can fit into its holding investment portfolio in such a way that investment risk can be hedged . Second, The invest-ment behaviours are much sparser than conventional recom-mendation applications and a VC X  X  investments are usually limited to a few industry categories, making it impossible to use a topic-diversification method to hedge the risk. In this paper, we solve the startup recommendation problem from a risk management perspective. We propose 5 risk-aware startup selection and ranking algorithms to catch the VCs X  investment behaviours and predict their new invest-ments. Apart from the contribution on the new risk-aware recommendation model, our experiments on the collected CrunchBase dataset show significant performance improve-ments over strong baselines.

Early-stage investment is a key driving force of techno-logical innovation and is vitally important to the wider eco-nomy, especially in high-growth and hi-tech industries, such as life sciences, clean-tech and information technology. Tra-ditionally, investment opportunities are either referred or  X  Joint first authorship.
 c  X  identified through manual technology scans [18]. The main stages of an investor X  X  decision making process involve deal origination, screening, evaluation, structuring and post in-vestment activities. These stages align with those iden-tified by other research into venture capital (VC) invest-ment [7]. In recent years, the traditional venture financing landscape has also shown signs of evolving. Some commen-tators [2] depict an industry  X  X rifurcating X  with (i) top-tier firms, e.g., Sequoia Capital, (ii) incubators and accelera-tors, e.g., Y Combinator, and, finally, (iii) firms that are taking a more quantitative approach to funding, e.g., Corre-lation Ventures. There is potentially a fourth factor in the emergence of entirely new funding sources such as  X  X rowd-funding X  which generally operate through online platforms, e.g., AngelList. Shifts towards more quantitative and data driven approaches along with new opportunities for online private investment provide additional impetus and scope for applying data mining and intelligent recommendations to this domain [17].

Whilst recommendation is useful in helping make invest-ment decisions, this new domain, however, is quite distinct from existing applications of recommender systems (e.g., for movies and music) and represents unique cha-llenges. First, an essential question about venture finance is to es-timate and control the risk, which is not well modelled for traditional recommender systems. Specifically, in a recent work where the collaborative filtering method is applied to the startup recommendations [17], the authors purely ex-plored the similarity between new investment opportunities and VCs X  holding investments. Promoting similar oppor-tunities may be attractive to the VCs at the first sight, but such similarity-based methods fail to catch VCs X  un-derlying main investment intention, which is to examine how well the new investment will fit into the current in-vestment portfolio to hedge the risk and increase the re-turn [9]. Figure 1 further illustrates our motivation by em-ploying a latent-factor model on our collected dataset from CrunchBase ( https://www.crunchbase.com/ ). This figure compares the mean and variance between the probabilistic matrix factorisation (PMF) [14] recommendations and VCs X  groundtruths (detailed in Section 3). The PMF recommen-dations are made to contain the same number of items as the groundtruths for each VC in order to make comparison. We can see that for 76 . 3% VCs, PMF recommendations have higher mean values, but in 83 . 5% cases, the VCs X  true investments have lower variances and thus lower risk.
Furthermore, investments usually involve a long term pro-cess, which is different from content consumption behaviours such as movie watching. It is because a VC X  X  decision on more investments does not necessarily indicate terminations of previous holding investments, but adding them into the existing portfolio. This emphasises the need that instead of
