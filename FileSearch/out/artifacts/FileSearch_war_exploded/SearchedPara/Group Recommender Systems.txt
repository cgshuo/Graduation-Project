 Group recommender systems provide suggestions in contexts in which people operate in groups. The goal of this tutorial is to provide the RecSys audience with an overview on group recommendation. We will first formally introduce the prob-lem of producing recommendations to groups, then present a survey based on the tasks performed by these systems. We will also analyze challenging topics like their evaluation, and present emerging aspects and techniques in this area. The tutorial will end with a summary that highlights open issues and research challenges.

While recommender systems suggest items that the in-dividual users might like, group recommender systems are designed to operate in contexts in which more than one per-son is involved in the recommendation process [7]. The goal overview on group recommendation, by analyzing the as-pects that characterize these systems, the evaluation meth-ods (evaluating the accuracy for a group is not trivial [10]), the emerging aspects, and the current challenges.
In detail, the outline of the tutorial is the following.  X

Ludovico Boratto is a research assistant at the University of Cagliari (Italy). His main research area are Recommender Systems, with special focus on those that work with groups of users and in social environments. In 2010 and 2014, he spent 10 months at the Yahoo! Lab in Barcelona as a visiting researcher. [1] S. Amer-Yahia, B. Omidvar-Tehrani, S. Basu Roy, and [2] L. Boratto and S. Carta.
