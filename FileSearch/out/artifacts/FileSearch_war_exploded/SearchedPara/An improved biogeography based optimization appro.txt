 1. Introduction
It is a well known fact that image segmentation is considered an important preprocessing step in development of sophisticated and complex image processing algorithms. Among image seg-mentation techniques, thresholding based techniques and espe-cially multilevel thresholding based techniques enjoy a lot of popularity among researchers all over the world. However, obtaining efficient performance utilizing multilevel thresholding always poses a great challenge as the cost of misclassification of pixels can be of paramount importance, depending on the image(s) under consideration. Depending on the application at hand, the minute level of detailed segmentation, and hence extraction, to be achieved, keeps on changing ( Jain, 1989 ; Gonzalez and Woods, 2000 ; Pal and Pal, 1993 ). Hence, segmenta-tion problems may require that the image intensity histogram be classified using a single threshold (as in bi-level thresholding), using two thresholds (as in three-level thresholding) or using more than three thresholds. However, the robust, automatic determination of these thresholds, to produce high performance segmented images, still remains a challenging problem in the domain of image segmentation.

There have been several methods, proposed so far, for multi-level thresholding based image segmentations ( Kapur et al., 1985 ; Otsu, 1979 ; Pun, 1980 ; Yin, 1999 ; Brink, 1994 ; Li et al., 1995 ;
Cheng and Lui, 1997 ; Tobias and Seara, 2002 ; Huang and Wang, 1995 ; Cheng et al., 1998 ; Saha and Udupa, 2001 ; Hu et al., 2006 ;
Tao et al., 2007 , 2003 ; Zhao et al., 2001 ; Sahoo et al., 1988 ). Many of these methods are based on maximization of entropy, used as a measure to determine high quality of segmentation performed.
Most of these schemes attempt to optimize an objective function to achieve optimal thresholding such that the thresholded classes achieve some desired characteristic. Some of these methods attempt to maximize posterior entropy to measure homogeneity of segmented classes ( Kapur et al., 1985 ; Brink, 1994 ; Cheng et al., 1998 ; Saha and Udupa, 2001 ). In ( Otsu, 1979 ), Otsu proposed a very popular method of image segmentation by maximizing the separability between different segments using Euclidean distance based between-class variance. Another popular method attempted to maximize the upper bound of the posterior entropy, derived from the histogram, developed by Pun ( Pun, 1980 ). In
Saha and Udupa (2001) , thresholds were determined by jointly maximizing the class uncertainty and the region homogeneity.
Several thresholding techniques have also been proposed based on index of fuzziness, fuzzy similarity measure and fuzzy entropy ( Li et al., 1995 ; Cheng and Lui, 1997 ; Tobias and Seara, 2002 ; Huang and Wang, 1995 ; Cheng et al., 1998 ; Tao et al., 2007 , 2003 ; Zhao et al., 2001 ). In this decade, the principle employing fuzzy entropy has emerged as a popular measure for thresholding based image segmentation. A fuzzy entropy is a function on fuzzy sets whose measure varies with the sharpness of its argument fuzzy set ( Tao et al., 2003 ). Researchers have used the concept of fuzzy entropy in different ways, for the purpose of image segmentation. In Cheng et al. (1998) , the concept of fuzzy logic was implemented to calculate fuzzy homogeneity vectors that involve the spatial uncertainties among image pixels. In Cheng et al. (2000) , a new approach to fuzzy entropy was proposed which was utilized for automatic determination of fuzzy regions of membership functions. In this paper, we utilize an approach developed latter for implementing fuzzy entropy principle, pro-posed in ( Tao et al., 2007 , 2003 ), which was inspired by the algorithm proposed in Zhao et al. (2001) . This fuzzy entropy measure is developed utilizing fuzzy c -partition (FP) and the probability partition (PP) and deals with measuring the compat-ibility between these two indices.
 criterion is to find the optimum of each such measure, as a function of the optimum threshold intensity gray levels. The stochastic optimization techniques, employing population-based methodologies, have been proven as successful algorithms for optimizing entropy based measures, in recent times, to solve such optimization problems. Several such candidate algorithms have been reported utilizing genetic algorithm (GA) ( Yin, 1999 ; Tao et al., 2003 ; Cheng et al., 2000 ), ant colony optimization (ACO) ( Tao et al., 2007 ), particle swarm optimization (PSO) ( Maitra and
Chatterjee, 2008 ), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) ( Maitra and Chatterjee, 2008 ) etc. The present paper proposes the devel-opment of a three-level thresholding algorithm maximizing fuzzy entropy, utilizing a very recently proposed population-based algorithm, called biogeography based algorithm (BBO) ( Simon, 2008 ). The BBO algorithm mimics the natural phenomenon of migration of species from one geographical area (called  X  X  X sland X  X  or  X  X  X abitat X  X ) to another geographical area, how new species are created and how species become extinct. The suitability of each habitat is evaluated on the basis of a habitat suitability index ( HSI ). Like in other population based algorithms, HSI plays the role similar to objective function and each habitat plays the role of a candidate solution. The HSI of each habitat depends on its constituent features (like each individual variable/dimension in a population based stochastic optimization algorithm) and each such feature is called a suitability index variable ( SIV ). The objective is to determine the best habitat (which is actually a combination of several SIV s), for which the HSI is maximum. To achieve this goal, each habitat of the population is subjected to  X  X  X igration X  X  and  X  X  X utation X  X  procedures, generation after genera-tion, until the termination criterion is satisfied. In our work we have proposed some modifications of the basic BBO algorithm to achieve improved performance. We propose to implement non-linear variations of immigration rate and emigration rate (dis-cussed later) with species count in a habitat, as opposed to the common idea of linearly varying these two factors with species count in basic BBO algorithm.
 three-level thresholding algorithm, utilizing basic BBO algorithm and its proposed improved variants for real CT scan images obtained from the human head. The methods utilize maximiza-tion of a fuzzy entropy criterion to determine these optimal thresholds. The computed tomography (CT) scanning is a well known diagnostic tool for scanning interior portions of our body. It helps the physicians with the views of internal body structures.
A CT scan procedure facilitates creation of multiple cross-sec-tional image slices on a cathode-ray tube (CRT), obtained by passing X-rays through our body. Head CT scans are used for several purposes like examining the brain, detecting the sinuses, detecting bleeding, brain injury and skull fractures, detecting a blood clot, detecting a stroke etc. We have tested our algorithms for a series of image slices captured from a volunteer head.
A comparison of segmentation performances of improved BBO variants show they could largely outperform the performances of basic BBO algorithm, and of two other popular population-based algorithms, namely, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm algorithm (PSO).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a short pre-amble on CT scan and gives a description of our system for capturing real images from CT scans of human head.
Section 3 describes the very recent biogeography-based optimi-zation strategy. Section 4 presents our proposed modifications to the basic BBO. Section 5 presents the fuzzy entropy criterion based measure employed for optimal three-level thresholding. Performance evaluation is presented in detail in Section 6 .
Conclusions are presented in Section 7 . 2. The CT scan
A CT scan is a short form for computerized tomography. The method employs digital geometry processing technique to pro-duce a 3D image of the interior structure of a body, utilizing a large series of 2D X-ray images, taken around a single axis of rotation. It is basically an X-ray technique but differs from the conventional X-ray examinations. In CT scan, we obtain images of our body that visualize internal structures in cross section, which is in contrast to the conventional X-ray examinations which produce overlapping images. In conventional X-ray technique, a stationary X-ray machine is used to focus beams of radiation on a particular area of our body to produce two-dimensional images on film or a digital detector. But a CT scan system is equipped with an X-ray unit that rotates around our body and is connected to a computer-based acquisition system. Hence a CT scan pro-duces a set of cross-sectional image slices of the interior of our body. A CT scan is usually prescribed to have clear view of the bones and organs and the inner structures of our abdomen, liver, stomach, intestines, kidney, pancreas, adrenal glands, etc.
A CT scan of the head is usually conducted to detect (i) bleeding, brain injury and skull fractures, (ii) a blood clot, (iii) a stroke, (iv) brain tumors, (v) diseases/malformations of the skull, (vi) to evaluate the extent of bone and soft tissue damage in patients, (vii) to plan radiation therapy for cancer of the brain or other tissues, (viii) to guide the passage of a needle used to obtain a tissue sample (biopsy) from the brain etc. ( Online ). Since its introduction in the 1970s, CT has become an important tool in medical imaging to supplement X-rays and medical ultrasono-graphy. Although it is still quite expensive, it is the gold standard in the diagnosis of a large number of different disease entities.
There are several advantages that CT has over traditional two-dimensional medical radiography, which make them such a popular choice ( Online ). One of the premier advantages is that
CT can completely eliminate the superimposition of images of structures outside the area of interest. The second prominent feature is that because of the inherent high-contrast resolution of
CT, differences between tissues that differ in physical density by less than 1% can be distinguished. The third advantage presents us with the flexibility that a single CT imaging procedure consisting of either multiple contiguous or one helical scan can be viewed as images in the axial, coronal, or sagittal planes, depending on the diagnostic task. Although CT scanning has so many advantages to boast off, it remains a moderate to high radiation diagnostic technique.

For our work, the images were acquired from the CT scan of the head of a volunteer in Henri Mondor Hospital, in Cre  X  teil, Paris, France. The image acquisition system employed was a famous multi-slice CT scanner, bought from PHILIPS. The resolution of the CT scan system was 0.4883 mm per pixel, each slice was 0.9 mm thick, and the spacing between the consecutive slices was 0.45 mm. 3. The biogeography-based optimization algorithm
Biogeography is known as a popular method of studying geographical distribution of biological organisms, whose earliest works can be traced back to the days of Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin ( Simon, 2008 ). The mathematical models of biogeography are available which describe the governing laws about migration of species from one island to another island, the arrival of new species and the extinction of some existing species. However, only very recently a population based optimization technique has been proposed employing the basic nature of biogeography and it has been named biogeography-based opti-mization (BBO) ( Simon, 2008 ; Online ). In biogeography models, the fitness of a geographical area (called  X  X  X sland X  X  or  X  X  X abitat X  X ) is judged on the basis of habitat suitability index (called HSI ). A habitat with a high HSI indicates that it is more suited for species to reside here. Similarly a habitat with a low HSI indicates that it is less suited for species to reside there. It is natural that higher the HSI of a habitat, it is likely that more number of species will be present there. The variables that characterize habitability, e.g. rainfall, vegetation, temperature etc., are called suitability index variables ( SIV s). The dynamics of the movement of the species among different habitats is mainly governed by two parameters, called immigration rate ( l ) and emigration rate ( m ) and these two parameters are functions of the species count in a habitat. Fig. 1 shows the species model of a single habitat ( Simon, 2008 ; MacArthur and Wilson, 1967 ). The curve shows a special case when maximum immigration rate ( I ) and maximum emigra-tion rate ( E ) are equal. However, strictly speaking, there is no such constraint and the condition of equality can be easily relaxed. In this curve the maximum number of species that a habitat can host is considered to be S max . When the number of species ( S ) is small, there is more possibility of immigration of species from neighbor-ing habitats and less possibility of emigration of species from this habitat to neighboring habitats. With the increase in the popula-tion of species, the possibility of immigration to the habitat decreases and the possibility of emigration from the habitat increases. This is characterized by the two curves for immigration rate and emigration rate in Fig. 1 . When S  X  S 0 , the equilibrium condition is reached i.e. in a given time span, the same number of species immigrate to and emigrate from the habitat.

Let the probability that the habitat contains S species at time t be given by P s . Then the expression for P s can be given in accordance with the differential equation ( Simon, 2008 ) _
P  X  8 &gt; &lt; &gt; : here l s  X  the immigration rate when there are S species in the habitat and m s  X  the emigration rate when there are S species in the habitat. Let us define n  X  S max . As there is a possible maximum of S max number of species in the habitat, we can obtain a matrix relation governing the dynamic equations of the probabilities of species count in the habitat
These basic ideas of biogeography have been utilized to design a population based optimization procedure that can be poten-tially used to solve many engineering and other optimization problems. As there are a lot of similarities between the mathe-matical model of biogeography and the population-based optimi-zation algorithms, it was quite natural that researchers/ theoreticians would someday find interest to develop an optimi-zation analog of the phenomenon of biogeography in nature. The BBO algorithm proposed in ( Simon, 2008 ) designates each habitat
H as a potential m 1 vector solution, where H A SIV m i.e. each habitat or solution comprises m SIV s. For each habitat H , we find out its HSI which corresponds to the fitness function in popula-tion-based algorithms. A habitat with a higher HSI indicates that it is a better candidate for the optimum solution. It is considered that the ecosystem comprises n habitats i.e. the ecosystem is H
In the context of population-based optimization algorithms, it means there are a total of n possible candidate solutions (i.e. the population size). In the basic BBO algorithm, the immigration and emigration rates vary linearly with species count, as shown in
Fig. 1 ( Simon, 2008 ) and they can be described by the following equations: l  X  I 1 and  X  E S
S max  X  4  X  when E  X  I , it means that l s  X  m s  X  E , i.e. the maximum emigration rate.

Algorithm 1 describes the basic BBO algorithm. In step 1, we need to initialize the BBO parameters. Here we need to input some free parameters like maximum number of generations ( gen ),
S , E , I , maximum migration rate ( m max ), elitism parameter ( n ). This step also requires developing a mapping of the problem solutions to SIV s and habitats, in accordance with which correspond to the candidate solutions for the optimization problem. It is most likely that these randomly initialized solutions will require fine tuning to produce the final optimum solution.  X  X  X igration X  X  and the  X  X  X utation X  X  procedures to evolve new habitats.
This procedure of subjecting the habitats to the  X  X  X igration X  X  procedure, followed by the  X  X  X utation X  X  procedure, is continued generation after generation, until we reach the termination condi-tion. This condition can be the expiration of the maximum number of generations or obtaining the desired solution i.e. the HSI of the best habitat achieving desired minimum of the fitness function. species count S and its corresponding m S and l S . To subject the habitats to a  X  X  X igration X  X  procedure, the basic concept is to utilize the immigration and the emigration rates, m S and l S , of each solution to probabilistically share information between habitats.
Here each non-elite habitat can be potentially modified on the basis of a habitat modification probability ( P habit ). For each selected habitat, we then probabilistically decide which are the SIV s of this habitat that are needed to be modified. Once each such
SIV of the chosen habitat is selected, we randomly select an SIV of a randomly selected neighboring habitat to migrate and replace the chosen SIV in the chosen habitat. As mentioned, this migra-tion procedure is only applied for candidate non-elite habitats i.e. a procedure of elitism is employed to preserve some of the best habitats in the previous generation. This helps us to prevent best solutions from being corrupted due to the process of immigra-tion. At the end of  X  X  X igration X  X  procedure, we re-compute the HSI of the habitats. This gives us an idea whether the procedure of migration actually helped us to produce fitter candidate solutions/ habitats.

Once the  X  X  X igration X  X  phase is over, each non-elite habitat can be potentially subjected to a  X  X  X utation X  X  procedure. To apply this procedure, at first we re-compute the probabilities of species count using Eqs. (1) and (2) i.e. utilizing the knowledge of m l . The procedure of mutation tends to increase diversity among the population and hence, it is hoped, that newer and fitter solutions will evolve at the end of this procedure. A deeper analysis of Fig. 1 reveals that it is of low probability to either have large number of species or small number of species. It is more probable to have medium number of species. Hence we can infer that medium HSI solutions are always highly probable.
Hence, it is very unlikely that a low probability solution will survive and in all likelihood it will mutate to a new solution. On the other hand, there is less possibility of a high probability solution to mutate. This is implemented as a mutation rate mut ( S ), given as ( Simon, 2008 ) mut  X  S  X  X  m max 1 P S P
Here, for each non-elite habitat, we select an SIV of the habitat at random, based on a probability that is proportional to the probability of its species count and if an SIV of the habitat is selected, it is replaced by a randomly generated SIV . This process is repeated for each non-elite habitat. So, as in  X  X  X igration X  X  procedure, in  X  X  X utation X  X  procedure also we employ a mechanism of elitism.

The basic BBO algorithm employs linear variations of immi-gration rate and emigration rate with the number of species in a habitat, following Eqs. (3) and (4). In this work, we propose to implement nonlinear variations of immigration rate and emigra-tion rate with the number of species in a habitat. The basic spirit of these variations will not violate the original considerations i.e. the immigration rate should decrease and emigration rate should increase with number of species. Our proposed variations for these two rates can be described as l and Theoretically both p 1 and p 2 can be chosen in the range (0, The basic BBO algorithm is a special case of these improved variants proposed in Eqs. (6) and (7), where p 1  X  p 2  X  1.0. Our proposed modifications provide us more flexibility, and, depend-ing on the image(s) under consideration, we can choose an appropriate set f p 1 , p 2 g accordingly. Fig. 2 shows typical varia-tions of these proposed immigration and emigration rates, for the case when their maximum permissible values are same, i.e. E  X  I . However, this condition is not really a constraint and it can be relaxed, if so desired. 5. Three-level thresholding employing probability partition based maximum fuzzy entropy measure
The maximum fuzzy entropy measure was proposed in the works of Tao et al. ( Tao et al., 2007 , 2003 ), which were inspired by an earlier work of Zhao et al. (2001) , where an entropy function was utilized to measure the compatibility between the fuzzy c -partition (FP) and the probability partition (PP). In Tao X  X  work of dark pixels, medium pixels and bright pixels and each partition is characterized by a fuzzy membership function (MF). The dark pixels are characterized by a Z-shaped MF, the medium pixels are characterized by a &amp; -shaped MF and the bright pixels are characterized by an S-shaped MF. Let us consider that the gray image is of size M N and let there be L gray levels in the image, in the range [0, ( L 1)]. Then the image can be described as D  X f X  i , j  X  : i  X  0 , 1 , ::: , M 1 ; j  X  0 , 1 , ::: , N 1 g , G  X f 0 , 1 , ::: , L 1 g X  8  X 
If I  X  x , y  X  is the intensity value of the image at pixel location  X  x , y  X  , then one can write I  X  x , y  X  A G 8 X  x , y  X  A D
D  X f X  x , y  X  : I  X  x , y  X  X  k ,  X  x , y  X  A D g , k  X  0 , 1 , L 1  X  9  X 
Let the histogram of the image be given as H  X f h 0 , h 1 where h k denotes the number of pixels with gray-level k . Then we can also write h  X  h n k  X  1 , k  X  0 , 1 , , L 1  X  10  X 
In three-level thresholding the image domain D is composed of three partitions: E d , E m , and E b , corresponding to the dark, medium and bright regions of pixels. The objective is to obtain an unknown probabilistic partition P 3  X  E d , E m , E b whose prob-ability distribution is p  X  P  X  E d  X  , p m  X  P  X  E m  X  , p b  X  P  X  E b  X  X  11  X 
Fig. 3 shows the three membership functions used to approx-imate these probabilistic partitions to achieve three-level thresh-olding. Let these three fuzzy sets, corresponding to these three probabilistic partitions, as stated before, be given as Z -function (for dark pixels), &amp; -function (for medium pixels), and S -function (for bright pixels). The Z -function is characterized by the mem-bership function m d , the &amp; -function is characterized by the membership function m m , and the S -function is characterized by the membership function m b . From Fig. 3 it is evident that the performance of these partitions will depend on the supports of each MF i.e. it is dependent on the choice of the parameters in the medium and bright regions can be given as ( Tao et al., 2003 )  X  k  X  X   X  k  X  X   X  k  X  X  0 o a 1 r b 1 r c 1 r a 2 r b 2 r c 2 r 255  X  15  X  threshold points. Let these two threshold points be T 1 and T .

Then the thresholding procedure will yield three partitions, given as D kd  X f X  x , y  X  : I  X  x , y  X  r T 1 ,  X  x , y  X  A D k g
D km  X f X  x , y  X  : T 1 o I  X  x , y  X  r T 2 ,  X  x , y  X  A D probability and with the assumption that the membership value of a pixel with an arbitrary intensity level k in a given class can be made equal to its corresponding conditional probability, we can write p d  X  p m  X  p b  X  ( Tao et al., 2007 , 2003 ) H d  X  H m  X  H b  X  fuzzy entropy in each class and this entropy is a function of the six support parameters present in the membership functions, as shown in Fig. 3 . Hence we try to obtain the optimal set of f a 1 , b 1 , c 1 , a 2 , b 2 , c 2 g such that the total fuzzy entropy
H  X  a 1 , b 1 , c 1 , a 2 , b 2 , c 2  X  X  H d  X  H m  X  H b  X  20  X  is maximized. Then the thresholds are obtained as the intersec-tion of the MF curves i.e.  X  T 1  X  X  m m  X  T 1  X  X  0 : 5  X  21  X  and  X  T 2  X  X  m b  X  T 2  X  X  0 : 5  X  22  X 
Utilizing the formulae given in (12) X (14), it can be written ( Tao et al., 2007 , 2003 )

In this work, we utilize BBO and its improved variants to obtain the optimum six element vector f a 1 , b 1 , c 1 , a which the total fuzzy entropy H , given in Eq. (20), will attain its maximum value. As BBO algorithm is essentially designed to solve minimization problems, we solve this maximization problem, given in Eq. (20), by constructing our fitness function as the negative of H i.e. we try to minimize H .
 6. Performance evaluation
The BBO based algorithm and its improved variants, proposed in this work, are all employed to solve a six-dimension optimiza-tion problem of minimizing H along with determination of the fittest candidate solution i.e. f a 1 , b 1 , c 1 , a 2 , b have been implemented for fifteen CT-scan image slices from the head of a volunteer, as described in Section 2 . The performances of the proposed algorithms are compared with two popular population-based algorithms, called genetic algorithm (GA) ( Tao et al., 2003 ) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with linearly decreasing inertia weights ( Clerc and Kennedy, 2002 ; Shi and Eberhart, 1999 ). Like the BBO algorithms, both
GA and PSO based algorithms are also employed to maximize the identical fuzzy entropy function given in Eq. (20). Like BBO, GA and PSO are also essentially minimization algorithms and there also we try to minimize H . At first, we try to compare the segmentation results of the basic BBO algorithm (denoted here as
BBO-Fuzzy algorithm) with the GA (denoted here as GA-Fuzzy algorithm) and the PSO algorithm (denoted here as PSO-Fuzzy algorithm), for the 15 image slices taken from the CT scans of the volunteer head. For the sake of proper comparison, each algo-rithm is run ten times and the results reported are the average results of these ten runs. Table 1 shows the values of the objective function i.e. total fuzzy entropy function which we wish to maximize along with representative optimal thresholds obtained with each algorithm for each slice. Table 2 presents representa-tive optimal parameter sets f a 1 , b 1 , c 1 , a 2 , b 2 the GA-Fuzzy and the PSO-Fuzzy algorithms. Figs. 4 X 6 show some sample images under consideration, and the resultant segmented images obtained after employing the BBO-Fuzzy, the GA-Fuzzy and the PSO-Fuzzy algorithms. Here it should be mentioned that in each image under consideration, the main region of interest (ROI) is present against a big black background and the outermost contour of the actual image ROI possesses a dark shade of gray. To preserve this outermost contour against the black background, for the purpose of meaningful image segmentation, we decided that after determination of the thresholds for an image, we preserve all original black pixels unchanged in the segmented image and accordingly replace all other pixels having intensities less than or equal to intensity value T 1 by a corresponding representative intensity level. This helps us to maintain the outermost region of the ROI in the segmented image as a dark shade which is different from black background and thus the distinct contour can be readily visible.
 segmented images, it is very difficu lt to draw a clear cut conclusion as which algorithm performs better. Hence it is quite common nowadays to compute a quantitative measure of the segmentation
Higher the value of this factor, the segmentation performance is considered to be better. This uniformity factor can be calculated as u  X  1 2 c where, c is the number of thresholds, R j the j th segmented region, N the total number of pixels in the given image, f i the gray level of pixel i , m j the mean gray level of pixels in j th region, f maximum gray level of pixels in the given image and f min minimum gray level of pixels in the given image.

Typically u A [0,1] and the higher the value of u , the better is the quality of the thresholded image. Table 3 shows a compara-tive study of the uniformity factors obtained using BBO-Fuzzy,
GA-Fuzzy and PSO-Fuzzy algorithms. To make a reasonable comparison we have chosen the same values for similar para-meters utilized in BBO, GA and PSO algorithms, e.g. the same population size/number of particles and the algorithms are run for same number of generations/iterations. Table 4 shows the free parameters chosen for these algorithms. From Table 1 it can be seen that out of these fifteen image slices, BBO-Fuzzy produced higher fuzzy entropy values for three cases, GA-Fuzzy for seven cases and PSO-Fuzzy for five cases. Table 3 shows that the general range of the uniformity factor obtained is [0.94, 0.96] which is considered satisfactory. But here we found that the BBO-Fuzzy algorithm could produce better performance measures in seven cases, GA-Fuzzy in two cases and PSO-Fuzzy could produce better performance measures in six cases. Hence, in terms of fuzzy entropy values, GA-Fuzzy emerged as the best approach, while, in terms of uniformity measure, BBO emerged as the best approach. Although one can argue that, as a final performance index of segmentation, uniformity measure should be given higher prior-ity that fuzzy entropy values (which means BBO emerges as the better candidate in this respect), it is still safe to conclude that it is very difficult to choose a clear winner among these three candidate algorithms. Hence we utilized our variants of BBO-Fuzzy algorithms, as described in Section 4 .

Table 5 shows a comparative study of the maximum values of the objective functions obtained, employing BBO-Fuzzy, Improved BBO-Fuzzy variants, GA-Fuzzy and PSO-Fuzzy algorithms, for the same set of image slices considered in Tables 1 X 3 . Table 6 shows the corresponding uniformity factors obtained. We have consid-ered four improved BBO-Fuzzy variants: (i) with p 1  X  0.5 and p 2  X  2.0 (called IBBO-F1 algorithm), (ii) with p 1  X  0.2 and p 2  X  5.0 (called IBBO-F2 algorithm), (iii) p 1  X  2.0 and p 2  X  0.5 (called IBBO-F3 algorithm), and (iv) p 1  X  5.0 and p 2  X  0.2 (called IBBO-F4 algorithm), for our simulations. Following these conventions, a choice of p 1  X  p 2  X  1.0 gives the basic BBO algorithm. A closer look at Table 5 reveals that out of the fifteen image slices under consideration, in eight cases some form of the IBBO-F variants produced highest values of the fuzzy entropy based objective function under consideration. Only in two cases PSO-Fuzzy algorithm, in four cases GA-Fuzzy algorithm, and in one case BBO-Fuzzy algorithm proved to be the winners. As far as the uniformity factor is considered, in nine out of fifteen cases, some form of the IBBO-F variants produced highest values, while only in five cases the PSO-Fuzzy algorithm and in one case the GA-Fuzzy algorithm proved to be the winner. These results clearly demonstrate that the proposed variants of the BBO algorithm indeed help to improve segmentation performance for three-level based histogram thresholding. Among the winning variants of the
IBBO-F variants, we found that the IBBO-F1 variant, with p 1  X  0.5 and p 2  X  2.0, could achieve the highest value of fuzzy entropy in five cases and the highest value of the uniformity factor in five cases. The IBBO-F2 variant, with p 1  X  0.2 and p 2  X  5.0, could achieve the highest value of fuzzy entropy in three cases but could achieve the highest value of the uniformity factor in only one case. On the other hand, the IBBO-F4 variant, with p 1  X  5.0 and p 2  X  0.2, could achieve the highest value of the uniformity factor in two cases, although it could never achieve the highest value for fuzzy entropy. Hence we would like to recommend, that at the moment, one should employ a trial and error approach to determine a suitable combination of p 1 and p 2 values. Our results have shown that there may be greater possibility of achieving better results with a representative choice of p 1 o 1.0 and p 2 4 1.0. At the same time we would also like to suggest that if there is a conflicting choice between a higher fuzzy entropy value and a higher uniformity factor value, one should settle for a solution with a higher uniformity factor value, because this reflects the final result of the segmentation procedure.
It is popular to develop BBO algorithms employing E  X  I ,although theoretically speaking, as mentioned earlier, it is not a constraint.
For the basic BBO algorithm, when E  X  I , it means that l the maximum emigration rate and always, at equilibrium condition, l  X  m s  X  E = 2. Also, since l S  X  I  X  1  X  S = S max  X  X  and then, the equilibrium number of species is always S 0  X  S proposed improved BBO versions are implemented for the popular scenario of E  X  I , at equilibrium condition, l s  X  m s will be achieved but each of them individually need not be at 50% of E . This value will vary in the range (0, E ) depending on the individual choices of p 1 and p 2. Similarly, in our variants, the equilibrium number of species S will vary in the range (0, S max ) depending on the individual choices of p 1and p 2. When p 1 o 1.0 and p 2 4 1.0, then S In this case, keeping p 1 fixed at a value less than unity, if we keep increasing p 2, then S 0 will gradually move closer to S max keeping p 2 fixed at a value greater than unity, if we keep reducing p 1, then also S 0 will gradually move closer to S max . So, in those situations, when p 1 o 1.0 and p 2 4 1.0, one general conclusion that can be drawn is that, keeping p 1or p 2 fixed, if we vary the other parameter, higher the difference between these two parameters, S will be closer to S max .

Let us now consider the opposite condition where p 1 4 1.0 and p 2 o 1.0. In these situations, always we shall find that S In this case, keeping p 1 fixed at a value higher than unity, if we keep decreasing p 2, then S 0 will gradually move away from 50% of S max closer to zero. Similarly, keeping p 2 fixed at a value lower than unity, if we keep increasing p 1, then also S 0 will gradually move away from 50% of S max closer to zero. So, in those situations, when p 1 4 1.0 and p 2 o 1.0, one general conclusion that can be drawn is that, keeping p 1or p 2 fixed, if we vary the other parameter, higher the difference between these two parameters, S will become smaller and move closer to zero. In our experi-mentations, we have considered two representative situations each for two opposite combinations of p 1 and p 2 on both sides of unity (two combinations with p 1 4 1.0 and p 2 o 1.0 and two combinations with p 1 o 1.0 and p 2 4 1.0). For this very problem, it has been shown that overall superior solutions are obtained with representative choices of p 1 o 1.0 and p 2 4 1.0. However, as remarked earlier, the best possible combination of { p 1, p 2} is expected to vary with the choice of the set of images to be segmented. However, this initial guideline is expected to help an end user to arrive at a suitable solution with minimum hardship. 7. Conclusion
In this paper, we have demonstrated how biogeography based optimization (BBO) technique, a very recently proposed popula-tion-based optimization technique, can be utilized to develop a three-level histogram thresholding based image segmentation technique. The method has been successfully implemented for segmenting real images obtained from CT scanning of a human head. The method essentially employs the principle of maximiza-tion of a fuzzy entropy function to determine the optimal thresh-olds. The present work also proposes how new improved BBO techniques can be implemented with nonlinear variation of immigration rate and emigration rate vs. number of species in a habitat. The proposed improved BBO based algorithms and the basic BBO algorithm are implemented for segmentation of fifteen real CT image slices and the results are compared vis-a-vis particle swarm optimization (PSO) based segmentation of the same images using the principle of maximization of fuzzy entropy. It has been demonstrated that some form of the improved BBO based variant could largely outperform both basic BBO-Fuzzy and PSO-Fuzzy algorithms. It is recommended that the choice of a specific improved BBO based variant should be carried out on a trial and error basis. However, our results have provided a thumb rule which can be adopted in providing a possible search direction for choosing the specific improved BBO based variant, where it is expected to obtain satisfactory segmentation performance.
Our experimentations showed that when the basic BBO-Fuzzy algorithm was compared vis-a-vis GA-Fuzzy and PSO-Fuzzy algorithms, the BBO-Fuzzy algorithm could not emerge as a clear winner. In terms of fuzzy entropy, its results were overpowered by GA-Fuzzy algorithm, and, in terms of uniformity factor, its performances were comparable to those of PSO-Fuzzy algorithm.
However, when our proposed variants of BBO-Fuzzy were employed, they produced clear winners in terms of both fuzzy entropy and uniformity factor. This is because the proposed variants of BBO arm this algorithm with greater flexibility. The performance of each optimization procedure for a certain pro-blem will vary with the nature of variation of the objective function with time, whether the objective function is unimodal or multimodal, how many local minima are present along with the global minimum, the steepness of the variation of the objective function over iterations, etc. Hence it is obvious that a more flexible optimization procedure is more likely to produce relatively satisfactory results over a variety of problems than a rigid optimization procedure. In case of this problem at hand, each image presents a different objective function and the nature of this function can vary widely with the wide relative spatial variations in intensities in each image. The basic BBO offers a relatively rigid procedure because every time the equilibrium condition is reached, it means that always l s  X  m s  X  E = 2 and the equilibrium number of species is S 0  X  S max = 2. However, our proposed variants indicate that, for any equilibrium condition reached, l s  X  m s will be achieved but this value will vary in the range (0, E ), and also the equilibrium number of species S vary in the range (0, S max ). The individual values attained by l and S 0 at the equilibrium condition will depend on the individual choices of p 1 and p 2. Hence, depending on the problem at hand, the user has the flexibility to choose individual combinations of p 1 and p 2 to test which combination will produce the best performance in a given scenario. This is the reason why the improved variants of BBO produced, overall, much superior results compared to the basic BBO algorithm.
