 Doc u ment cl u sterin g plays an essential role in Information Retrieval (IR) as it is capable to increase the pr ecision and recall [1] val u es. This is d u e to havin g a better techniq u es that a u tomatically partition a collection of doc u ments into meanin g f u l g ro u ps, formally known as cl u sters [2]. Based on literat u re, doc u ment cl u sterin g techniq u es can be cate g orized into two approaches; P artitional and Hierarchical doc u ments into a n u mber of cl u sters and represent them into a flat level [5]. K-means is an example of this approach [6] where the cl u sters are constr u cted by minimizin g the distance between center and objects. Beca u se of its simplicity and efficiency for lar g e dataset, it has been u sed in many applications and proved to be s u ccessf u l. However, the main drawback of the al g orithm is that it is hi g hly dependent on the initialization of k n u mber of cl u sters [6]. 
On the other hand, Hierarchical cl u sterin g b u ilds m u lti levels of cl u sters by u tilizin g one of the two widely u sed approaches; divisive approach(top down) or a gg lomerative approach (bottom u p) [7]. The divisive approach divides a dataset into smaller g ro u ps and or g anizes cl u sters in a hierarchy form [8]. An example of this approach is the Bisect K-means [9, 20], where, at each level, the al g orithm chooses cl u ster to classify into two cl u sters by selectin g two centers and assi g nin g the objects hand, the a gg lomerative approach mer g es two cl u sters into one cl u ster based on some criterion s u ch as sin g le link, complete link or avera g e link [20]. One pop u lar al g orithm of s u ch approach is the U P GMA [10]. 
The g oal of doc u ment cl u sterin g al g orithms is to obtain nat u ral cl u sters witho u t the treated as an optimization problem. Based on literat u re, there are two approaches to capability of swarm insects s u ch as ants, flocks, bees, etc. [11]. Swarm based the n u mber of cl u sters. An example is the Dynamic FCl u st that is based on bird flocks the ran g e of k val u es; minim u m and maxim u m val u e of k . Then, exec u te the cl u sterin g method with different k cl u sters and meas u re the performance. The maxim u m/minim u m val u e of performance metrics can be chosen to represent the best obtained cl u sters [1]. 
In this paper, the Firefly Al g orithm (FA), which was introd u ced by Yan g (2010) Gravitation Firefly Al g orithm GFA [19], by introd u cin g a re-locate mechanism that aims to improve the cl u sterin g res u lt by enhancin g the p u rity of prod u ced cl u sters. A benchmark dataset obtained from the 20Ne w s g ro u ps is u sed to realize the proposed mechanism. The paper is or g anized as follows; Section 2 provides the related work [19]. Section 4containselaboration on the proposed GFA _R and the res u lts are presented in section 5. Finally, concl u sion of the work is made in section 6. This section provides a review on several al g orithms commonly u sed in text cl u sterin g , and this incl u des K-means and Bisect K-means. F u rthermore, it also contains disc u ssions on swarm al g orithms s u ch as P SO and Firefly Al g orithm. 2.1 K-means K-means is an example of partitional cl u sterin g al g orithm that has been widely u sed in many domains. It is easily implemented, efficient in exec u tion and simple [6]. K-means initially selects k n u mber of cl u sters. This is followed by assi g nin g objects in a dataset to the nearest center (The similarity is determined by E u clidean distance). The center of each cl u ster is calc u lated by identifyin g the mean. The process of assi g nin g objects and recalc u lates contin u e u ntil the stoppin g condition is reached. Fi g . 1 ill u strates the process of K-means. 
K-means has been widely u tilized in text cl u sterin g [21], [27]. The work prior knowled g e of doc u ments in the collection and employs E u clidean distance of K-means. The res u lts o u tperformed the standard K-means. On the other hand, in [21], researchers proposed a variant of K-means, known as Bisect K-means. It g enerates better doc u ment cl u sters compared to K-means accordin g to entropy performance metric and overall similarity metric. 2.2 Bisect K-means Bisect K-means is an example of al g orithm for divisive hierarchical approach and was proposed by Steinbach et al. in 2000 [21]. The al g orithm classifies collection of randomly chooses two centers and assi g ns objects to a similar center. The operation cl u ster or maxim u m avera g e distance [9], [20]. The process of Bisect K-means is ill u strated in Fi g . 2. 
There has been work[9] that proposed a cooperative approach between Bisect K-means and K-means, where, the cooperative approach combines the o u tp u t res u lts of Bisect K-means and K-means u tilizin g cooperative and mer g in g matrices. Similarly, in [20], a hybrid between Bisect K-means and U P GMA is proposed where Bisect K-means g enerates hi g her than K n u mber of cl u ster and u se U P GMA to combine step is important to chan g e the misplaced doc u ment. 2.3 Particle Swarm Optimization PSO As disc u ssed in section one, vario u s work can be seen in u tilizin g swarm based approaches in addressin g problem faced by the K-means al g orithm. One example of Meta-he u ristic optimization al g orithm incl u des the P article Swarm Optimization ( P SO) which was invented by Kennedy and Eberhart(1995). The basic idea of P SO comes from the flock and fora g in g behavior where each sol u tion has n dimensions search space. The birds did not have search space, so it is called  X  P articles X . Each particle has a fitness f u nction val u e that can be comp u ted u sin g a velocity of particles fli g ht direction and distance. The process of basic P SO cl u sterin g [15] is ill u strated in Fi g . 3. 
In [15], empirical work on the inte g ration of P SO and K-means has been presented to solve the problem of local optima in K-means. S u ch an approach has later motivated the u tilization of extended Jaccard coefficient as objective f u nction in P SO [28]. The res u lts demonstrated that a better performance was obtained compared to the K-means [6], Bisect K-means [9], a gg lomerative [20] and g raph based. 2.4 Standard Firefly Algorithm Another swarm based al g orithm is the Firefly al g orithm (FA). It has ability to identify g lobal optimal sol u tion efficiency [29]. The idea of Firefly al g orithm is based on two important factors; the li g ht intensity and the attractiveness between fireflies. The li g ht can be a maximization or minimization problem. The attractiveness,  X  , between fireflies is related with li g ht intensity and chan g es based on the distance between two fireflies. The process of Firefly al g orithm is shown in Fi g . 4 [16], [18]. cl u sterin g , the Gravitation Firefly Al g orithm (GFA) [19]. O u r earlier work GFA is extended to incl u de a relocatin g mechanism that can be u tilized u pon the completion of cl u sters creation. In the followin g section, we present the GFA while a newly proposed variant of FA is incl u ded in section 4. Gravitation Firefly al g orithm [19] was introd u ced as a variant of FA in text cl u sterin g . It contains two parts; obtain centers and constr u ct cl u sters. In [19], to obtain the centers, each firefly is represented by a sin g le doc u ment and the initial bri g htness, I, of the firefly is presented by the force between each doc u ment and an identified center of cl u ster. The doc u ment that has hi g h force is selected to represent the centroid. The GFA [19] str u ct u re is as shown in Fi g . 5. are constr u cted; the first incl u des doc u ments that have hi g h similarity with the identified center (centroid), and the second cl u ster contains doc u ments with lower approach may prod u ce a lar g e n u mber of cl u sters and hence may jeopardize the performance of a retrieval system. F u rthermore, the assi g nment of a doc u ment to a proposed that the GFA allows the re-location of an assi g ned doc u ment. In this paper, we introd u ced another variant of FA that is termed as Gravitation Firefly Al g orithm with Relocate (GFA _R ). The GFA _R operates when a new cl u ster, in GFA [19], is constr u cted. This al g orithm calc u lates the similarity between the newly identified centroid (center of new cl u ster) and doc u ments that have been assi g ned to other (previo u s) cl u sters. If the similarity val u e is hi g her, then the doc u ment is moved (re-locate) from the ori g inal cl u ster to the newly created cl u ster. Fi g . 6 ill u strates the pse u do code of the proposed GFA _R . experiment was cond u cted on the 20News g ro u ps [22]. Table 1 ill u strates a brief description of the u tilized dataset. This eval u ation is performed by comparin g the proposed GFA _R with the standard GFA [19] and also Bisect K-means [20]. Two types of performance indices are u sed; Relative indices s u ch as Davis Bo u ldin Index (DBI) and D u nn  X  s Index (DI), and External indices s u ch as Pu rity, F-meas u re and Entropy. F u rther, a statistical analysis of paired samples t-test is performed on the differences between the pairs of GFA and GFA _R , and GFA _R and Bisect K-means. All experiments were carried o u t in Matlabon windows 8 with a 2000 MHz processor and 4 GB memory. We exec u te GFA [19], GFA _R , and Bisect K-means [20] for ten (10)times with different n u mber of iterations and comp u te the avera g e val u e for each validity indices. 5.1 Comparison of GFA _R with GFA and Bisect K-means DI for three al g orithms, the proposed GFA _R , GFA and Bisect K-means. As can be seen from Table 2, the DBI val u e for GFA [19] is less than the GFA _R and Bisect K-means in all iteration, while, the DI val u e of GFA _R is hi g her than GFA in iteration 1, 2 and 10 compare a g ainst GFA and hi g her than Bisect K-means in all iteration. Based on literat u re, the hi g h val u e of DI and smallest val u e of DBI is best q u ality al g orithm [26]. 
F u rther, it is noted from Table II that the p u rity of GFA _R o u tperformed the GFA and Bisect K-means in all iterations where the best p u rity val u e (0.8807) g enerates by GFA _R in iteration 2 while the best for Bisect K-means is (0.4950) g enerated in iteration 20 and the best p u rity val u e for GFA is (0.7557) g enerated in iteration 1. In addition, the GFA _R has best Entropy a g ainst GFA and Bisect K-means also in all iteration, where the best val u e of GFA _R is (0.4798) prod u ced in iteration 2, while Bisect K-means g enerates best val u e (1.4071) in iteration 20 and GFA g enerates best val u e (0.7816) in iteration 1. Despite of GFA _R has the hi g hest F-meas u re a g ainst Bisect K-means in most iterations (refer to iterations 1, 2, 5 and 10), where the best p u rity and F-meas u re (approachin g to 1) and lower Entropy (approachin g to 0) leads to g ood q u ality cl u sters [8, 20]. Fi g . 7 shows the g raphical res u lts of the relative indices amon g GFA, GFA _R and Bisect K-means. In Fi g . 7(a), it can be observed that the c u rve of DBI in GFA is smallest than GFA _R and Bisect K-means. Accordin g to [26] the better cl u sterin g sol u tion has smallest val u e of DBI. This means the relocatin g al g orithm not enhance the DBI metric in GFA. In Fi gu re 7(b), we can see the c u rve of DI in GFA _R is hi g hest val u e than Bisect K-means in all iteration and is hi g hest than GFA in iteration 1, 2, 10 and 20 excl u din g iteration 5 which GFA has hi g hest val u e than GFA _R . Accordin g to [26] al g orithm effect on DI metric in GFA. Fi g . 8 displays the g raphical res u lts of the external indices amon g GFA, Relocatin g GFA _R al g orithms and Bisect K-means. 
Fi g . 8(a) ill u strates the Pu rity c u rve of GFA, GFA _R and Bisect K-means. We can see that the c u rve of GFA _R hi g her than the c u rve GFA and Bisect K-means in all iteration. We can concl u de that the GFA r u nnin g with a relocate mechanism has a Bisect K-means. We see that the c u rve of GFA increase in iteration 1, 2 and 5 than the c u rve of GFA _R which g enerates the best val u e 0.4889 in iteration 10. This means that the relocatin g al g orithm affect few on F-meas u re q u ality performance. Fi g . 8(c) presents the Entropy c u rve of GFA, GFA _R and Bisect K-means. We can observe that the c u rve of GFA _R is smaller than GFA and Bisect K-means in all iterations, where the best val u e is (0.4798) prod u ced by GFA _R in iteration 2, while Bisect K-means g enerates best val u e (1.4071) in iteration 20 and GFA g enerates best val u e ( 0.7816 ) in iteration 1. Lesson learned from this res u lt is that the GFA _R prod u ces better Entropy val u es. 5.2 Statistical Result The statistical analysis of paired samples t-test is performed on the differences between the pairs GFA and GFA _R , and also Bisect K-means and GFA _R . We s u ppose the n u ll hypotheses and the alternative hypotheses as shown below: H 0 : T h ere is n o differe n ce bet w ee n t h e m e an of t w o a l g orit hm s. H 1 : T h ere is a differe n ce bet w ee n t h e m e an of t w o a l g orit hm s. Bisect K-means. As can be seen in the table, i.e Table 3, the p-val u e between GFA _R and GFA and GFA _R and Bisect K-means is less than (0.05). This means the re-locate mechanism affects the p u rity of GFA. Therefore, we reject the n u ll hypotheses and concl u de that there is s u fficient evidence to accept the alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we present a GFA that incl u des a relocate mechanism and this new The GFA _R offers the ability to chan g e the location of any assi g ned doc u ment(s) from a cl u ster to a newly created cl u ster. S u ch an approach is taken to improve the The proposed GFA _R is realized in a benchmark dataset obtained from 20Ne w s g ro u ps . The obtained res u lts indicate that the proposed GFA _R o u tperformed GFA in Pu rity, Entropy and DI. Additionally, it is also a better approach as compared to the Bisect K-means. Hence, indicatin g that it can become a competitive method in the area of swarm based cl u sterin g . Acknowledgement.
