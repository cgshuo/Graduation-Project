 Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) between lan-guages of the same origin is an interesting topic of research. The similarity of the writing systems used for these lan-guages can be used effectively to not only improve CLIR, but to overcome the problems of textual variations, textual errors, and even the lack of linguistic resources like stem-mers to an extent. We have conducted CLIR experiments between three languages which use writing systems (scripts) of Brahmi-origin, namely Hindi, Bengali and Marathi. We found significant improvements for all the six language pairs using a method for fuzzy text search based on Surface Sim-ilarity. In this paper we report these results and compare them with a baseline CLIR system and a CLIR system that uses Scaled Edit Distance (SED) for fuzzy string matching.

CLIR systems need to be robust enough to tackle textual variations or errors both at the query end and at the docu-ment end. There are various reasons for textual variations like spelling variations, dialectal variations, morphological variations etc. Some of the common causes of errors are ty-pographical errors and errors in font conversion across mul-tiple proprietary encoding formats. IR systems have to take care of such variations [6, 2] to be able to perform reasonably well.

One of the techniques to achieve this is to use approximate or fuzzy string matching [5]. If such a technique benefits from the knowledge about the characteristics of the writings systems and their similarities, then it can further help in cross-lingual IR. In this paper, we report the results of using For evaluation, we used the CLIR data released at the FIRE 1 workshop, 2008. The corpora consisted of compara-ble news articles in Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi collected during 2004 to 2007. We used the 50 test queries provided at the FIRE workshop in each of these languages for our evaluation.

We conducted experiments on six different pairs of these three languages. The Corpora were indexed using the open-source search engine, Lucene 2 . Lucene X  X  OKAPI BM25 was used as the similarity metric for scoring and ranking the documents. The Run IDs and their descriptions are shown in Table 1. The fuzzy text search implementation in our system takes the input query word from the source language and returns the closest fuzzy string match from the target language. For reasons of convenience, we used Devanagari as the common script (to which all data was converted) for the experiments.

A simple, dictionary-based approach was used as the lower baseline for comparison. We also compared the performance of the fuzzy text search with Scaled Edit Distance or SED [1] based search for each of these runs. The reason for preferring SED over the normal edit distance is that it reduces the disparities between long and short words. The comparison of results is shown in Table 2. To estimate the importance of Surface Similarity, we explicitly avoided using any stemmers or morphological analyzers.

To evaluate the significance of our retrieval results, we conducted a paired T-test experiment between SED-based search and fuzzy text search using our method on all the six language pairs. We split the 50 test queries randomly into two equal, disjoint sets of 25 queries and repeated the ex-periment for 50 iterations to ensure smoothing in queries se-lection [3]. The results of the T-test experiments are shown in Table 3.
Similarities across languages of common origin and with similar writing systems have not been explored much from the IR perspective. In particular, there has been no such lin-guistically motivated work for languages which use writing systems of Brahmi origin. In this paper, we described a Sur-face Similarity based method for fuzzy string matching for performing CLIR and were able to show good improvement in performance. Our paired T-test results indicate that our retrieval scores are statistically significant. It may be noted that this method does not need any resources and, therefore, can be very useful for languages with scarce resources.
