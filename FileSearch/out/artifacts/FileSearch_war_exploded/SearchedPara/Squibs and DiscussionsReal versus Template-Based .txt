This article challenges the received wisdom that template-based approaches to the generation of well-foundedness, and quality of output. Some recent NLG systems that call themselves  X  X  X emplate-based X  X  will illustrate our claims. 1. Introduction
Natural language generation (NLG) systems are sometimes partitioned into application-dependent systems which lack a proper theoretical foundation, on the one hand, and theoretically well-founded systems which embody generic linguistic insights, on the other. Template-based systems are often regarded as automatically falling into the first category. We argue against this view. First, we describe the received view of both template-based and  X  X  X tandard X  X  NLG systems (section 2). Then we describe a class of recent template-based systems (section 3) that will serve as a basis for a comparison between template-based and other NLG systems with respect to their potential for performing NLG tasks (section 4). We ask what the real difference between template-based and other systems is and argue that the distinction between the two is becoming increasingly blurred (section 5). Finally, we discuss the implications of engineering shortcuts (Mellish 2000) and corpus-based methods (section 6). 2. Templates versus Real NLG: The Received View
Before we can argue against the distinction between template-based and  X  X  X eal X  X  NLG systems, we should first sketch how these two classes are commonly understood. It is surprisingly difficult to give a precise characterization of the difference between them (and we will later argue against the usefulness of such a characterization), but the idea is the following. Template-based systems are natural-language-generating systems that map their nonlinguistic input directly (i.e., without intermediate representations) to the linguistic surface structure (cf. Reiter and Dale 1997, pages 83 X 84). Crucially, this linguistic structure may contain gaps; well-formed output results when the gaps are filled or, more precisely, when all the gaps have been replaced by linguistic structures gaps.) Adapting an example from Reiter and Dale (1997), a simple template-based system might start out from a semantic representation saying that the 306 train leaves Aberdeen at 10:00 AM : and associate it directly with a template such as where the gaps represented by [train] and [town] are filled by looking up the relevant information in a table. Note that this template will be used only when the time referred to is close to the intended time of speaking; other templates must be used for generating departure announcements relating to the past or future.  X  X  X eal X  X  or, as we shall say, standard NLG systems, by contrast, use a less direct mapping between input and surface form (Reiter 1995; Reiter and Dale 1997). Such systems could start from the same input semantic representation, subjecting it to a number of consecutive transformations until a surface structure results. Various NLG submodules would operate on it (determining, for instance, that 10:00 AM is essentially the intended time of speaking), jointly transforming the representation into an intermediate representa-tion like where lexical items and style of reference have been determined while linguistic morphology is still absent. This intermediate representation may in turn be transformed into a proper sentence, for example: This train is leaving Aberdeen now . Details vary; in particular, many systems will contain more intermediate representations.
 (Reiter and Dale 1997); that is, each of them can generate all recursively enumerable languages. However, template-based systems have been claimed to be inferior with respect to maintainability, output quality and variation, and well-foundedness. Reiter and Dale (1997) state that template-based systems are more difficult to maintain and update (page 61) and that they produce poorer and less varied output (pages 60, 84) than standard NLG systems. Busemann and Horacek (1998) go even further by suggesting that template-based systems do not embody generic linguistic insights (page 238). Consistent with this view, template-based systems are sometimes over-looked. In fact, the only current textbook on NLG (Reiter and Dale 2000) does not pay any attention to template-based generation, except for a passing mention of the
ECRAN system (Geldof and van de Velde 1997). Another example is a recent overview of NLG systems in the RAGS project (Cahill et al. 1999). The selection criteria employed by the authors were that the systems had to be fully implemented, complete (i.e., generating text from nontextual input), and accepting non-hand-crafted input; al-though these criteria appear to favor template based systems, none of the 19 systems investigated were template-based. In what follows, we claim that the two types of systems have more in common than is generally thought and that it is counter-productive to treat them as distant cousins instead of close siblings. In fact, we argue that there is no crisp distinction between the two. 16 3. Template-Based NLG Systems in Practice
In recent years, a number of new template-based systems have seen the light, including TG /2 (Busemann and Horacek 1998), D 2 S (van Deemter and Odijk 1997; Theune et al. 2001), E XEMPLARS (White and Caldwell 1998), and Ali 2003), and X TRA G EN (Stenzhorn 2002). Each of these systems represents a substantial research effort, achieving generative capabilities beyond what is usually expected from template-based systems, yet they call themselves template-based, and they clearly fall within the characterization of template-based systems offered above.
 called D 2 S . D 2 S has been used as the foundation of a number of language-generating systems, including G OAL G ETTER , a system that generates soccer reports in Dutch. consists of two modules: (1) a language generation module (LGM) and (2) a speech generation module (SGM) which turns the generated text into a speech signal. Here we focus on the LGM and in particular on its use of syntactically structured templates to convert a typed data structure into a natural language text (annotated with prosodic information). Data structures in G OAL G ETTER are simple representations describing lists of facts, such as
Besides goal events, there are several other types of events, such as players receiving yellow or red cards. Figure 1 shows a simple template, which the LGM might use to express the above fact as, for instance, Kluivert scored a penalty in the 38th minute . (typically NPs and PPs) which may be substituted in the gaps of template in more detail, starting with the syntax tree, labeled by nonterminal symbols, while the nodes on the frontier are labeled by terminal or nonterminal symbols: the nonterminal nodes ( X  X  X aps X  X ) are open for substitution and they are marked by a , . The second element of a syntactic template is : the slot fillers. Each open slot in the tree S is associated with a call of some Express function ( ExpressTime , ExpressObject , etc.), which generates a set of expressions that can be used to fill the slot. The right-hand side of Figure 2 shows an example Express function, namely, ExpressObject , which generates a set of NP trees and is used to generate fillers for the player and goal slots in the template of Figure 1. The first, for example, leads to the generation of NPs such as Kluivert (proper name), the forward in which the NP is generated.
 the choice among all possible combinations of slot fillers. ApplyTemplate first calls
FillSlots to obtain the set of all possible trees ( all_trees ) that can be generated from the template, using all possible combinations of slot fillers generated by the Express functions associated with the slots. For each tree in this set, it is checked (1) whether it does not violate a version of the Chomskyan binding theory and (2) whether it is compatible with the context model, which is a record containing all the objects introduced so far and the anaphoric relations among them. From the resulting set of allowed_trees , one is selected randomly (using the function PickAny ) and returned to the main generation algorithm. The random-choice option was chosen to maximize the variety of sentences produced by the system.
 realization. Text planning is performed by components condition . A template s is applicable only if its associated condition is true. An example is the condition from Figure 1 saying that the template can be used only if the current goal is the first one which has not been conveyed (i.e., is not known). To cater to aspects of text planning that allow a less knowledge-intensive approach, G OAL G ETTER associates every template with a set of topics rithm uses to group sentences together into coherent chunks of text. For example, any 18 template associated with the topic of goal scoring can  X  X  X ire X  X  throughout the opening paragraph of the report. 4. Template-Based NLG: Deep or Shallow?
How do template-based systems measure up against the criteria mentioned in section 2? When dealing with this question, we are interested as much in what could be done in principle as in what has been achieved in practice. After some preliminary remarks, we focus on the criterion of linguistic well-foundedness.
 maintainability . Several template-based systems such as X
TRA G EN have been reused for generation in different languages or in different domains (cf. Kittredge et al. 1994). In the case of D 2 S and such functions as ApplyTemplate and ExpressObject have been used for different application domains (music, soccer games, route descriptions, and public transport) and different languages (English, Dutch, and German); generation of both monologues and dialogue contributions (van Deemter and Odijk 1997; Theune et al. 2001). When a template-based system is applied to a new domain or language, many of the templates will have to be written anew (much as new grammar fragments need to be developed for standard NLG systems), but the underlying generation mechanisms generally require little or no modification.
 have the same generative power as standard NLG systems (Reiter and Dale 1997), there cannot be a difference between the types of output that they are able to generate in principle. The fact that templates can be specified by hand gives template-based systems an advantage in cases in which good linguistic rules are not (yet) available or for constructions which have unpredictable meanings or highly specific conditions of use. Some template-based systems have variability as one of their central design specifications: Current D 2 S -based systems rely mainly on random choice to achieve variation, but more context-sensitive variations (e.g., varying the output depending on user characteristics) can also be achieved through the use of parametrized templates (X
TRA G EN ) or template specialization hierarchies (E XEMPLARS can be linguistically well-founded (or  X  X  X eep X  X  in terms of Busemann and Horacek [1998]), in the sense that the choices inherent in its mapping from input to output are based on sound linguistic principles. To judge the well-foundedness of template-based systems, let us look at the different types of decisions that an NLG system needs to make, as distinguished by Cahill et al. (1999) and Reiter and Dale (2000). 4.1 Content Determination
During content determination, it is decided what information is to be conveyed. Since content determination precedes language generation proper, it is clear that in principle , template-based systems can treat it in the exact same ways as standard NLG systems.
In practice , template-based systems tend to take their departure from  X  X  X lat data X  X  (e.g., database records), whereas standard systems often use richer input, in which some decisions concerning the linguistic structure of the output (e.g., decisions about quantificational or rhetorical structure) have already been made. To the extent that this is the case, the  X  X  X eneration gap X  X  to be bridged by template-based systems is actually wider than the one to be bridged by standard NLG systems. 4.2 Referring Expressions As for the generation of referring expressions, template-based systems vary widely:
The simplest of them (e.g., MSWord-based systems for mail merge) can fill their gaps with only a limited number of phrases, but more sophisticated systems (called NLG to fill their gaps. Recent systems have moved further in this direction. example, uses well-established rules for constraining the use of anaphors (see, e.g., the
Chomskyan ViolateBindingTheory and Wellformed in ApplyTemplate ) and a new variant of Dale and Reiter X  X  (1995) algorithm for the generation of referring expressions that takes contextual salience into account ( MakeReferringExp in ExpressObject ) (Krahmer and Theune 2002). A similar range of approaches can be found among NLG systems that are not template-based; in fact, several systems from the do not really address referring expression generation at all (Cahill et al. 1999). 4.3 Aggregation
Aggregation is an NLG task in which differences between the two types of systems may be expected. After all, every template contains a  X  X  X ixed X  X  part, and surely this part cannot be recombined with other parts? The reality is slightly more complex. The G
OAL G ETTER system, for instance, uses the following approach: In order to generate a subject-aggregated sentence of the form A and B got a red card , a separate template is called of the form X got a red card [syntactic structure omitted], subject to conditions requiring that the gap X be filled with an appropriate conjoined noun phrase, referring generate A got a red card and B got a red card , then aggregate these two structures (whose syntactic and semantic structure is known) into the desired conjunctive structure (van
Deemter and Odijk 1997). Whether a system is able to perform operations of this kind does not depend on whether the system is template based, but on whether it possesses the required syntactic and semantic information. 4.4 Lexicalization The same point is relevant for lexicalization. Let us suppose (perhaps rather charitably;
Cahill et al. 1999) that a variety of near-synonymous verbs are present in the lexicon of the NLG system (e.g., give , offer , donate , entrust , present to ). How would a standard NLG system choose among them? Typically, the system does not have a clue, because our understanding of the differences among these verbs is too imperfect. (The input to the system might prejudge such decisions by pairing each of these verbs with different input relations, but that would be cheating.) As with the previous tasks, it is not clear that standard NLG systems are in a better position to perform them than template-based ones: The latter could use templates that vary in the choice of words and specialization hierarchies in E XEMPLARS ). The condition for example (as opposed to X scored or X nudged the ball in ) might require that the ball did not touch the ground after departing the previous player. 4.5 Linguistic Realization
It is in linguistic realization that the most obvious differences between standard and template-based approaches appear to exist. Many template-based approaches lack a general mechanism for gender, number, and person agreement, for example. Systems in the D 2 S tradition avoid errors by letting functions like ExpressObject use handmade rules, but this approach becomes cumbersome when coverage increases; general-20 templates are used for John walks and John and Mary walk . One should not, however, let one X  X  judgment depend on accidental properties of one or two systems: Nothing keeps the designer of a template-based system from adding morphological rules; witness systems like YAG (McRoy, Channarukul, and Ali 2003) and X
The YAG system, for example, allows the subject and verb of a template to be underspecified for number and person, while using attribute grammar rules to complete the specification: Returning to the example above, the number attribute of
John and Mary is inferred to be plural (unlike, e.g., John and I ); a subject-verb agreement rule makes the further inference that the verb must be realized as walk , rather than walks . 5. Templates: An Updated View
A new generation of systems that call themselves template-based have blurred the line between template-based and standard NLG. This is not only because some systems combine standard NLG with templates and canned text (Piwek 2003), but also because modern template-based systems tend to use syntactically structured templates and allow the gaps in them to be filled recursively (i.e., by filling a gap, a new gap may result). Some  X  X  X emplate-based X  X  systems, finally, use grammars to aid linguistic realization. These developments call into question the very definition of  X  X  X emplate based X  X  (section 2), since the systems that call themselves template-based have come to express their nonlinguistic input with varying degrees of directness. syntactic knowledge used, and the number of steps involved in filling the templates, among other things. Here, we highlight one particular dimension, namely, the size of (the fixed part of) the templates. A comparison with tree-adjoining grammar ( based-approaches to NLG may be useful ( Joshi 1987; see also Becker 2002). Joshi (1987, page 234) points out that  X  X  X he initial ... trees are not constrained in any other manner than. . . . The idea, however, is that [they] will be minimal in some sense. X  X  Minimality is usually interpreted as saying that a tree should not contain more than the lexical head plus its arguments. Initial trees may be likened to templates. Nonminimal templates/ elementary trees are essential for the treatment of idioms and special collocations.
Generally speaking, however, the larger the templates/elementary trees, the less sys-tematic the treatment, the less insight it gives into the compositional structure of lan-guage, and the larger the number of templates/elementary trees needed. Again, the history of D 2 S is instructive: The earliest D 2 S -based NLG system ( Odijk 1997) used long templates, but the majority of the templates in G minimal in the sense explicated above (Theune et al. 2001). 6. Discussion: Shortcuts and Statistics in NLG
Let us compare our views with those of Mellish (2000). Mellish points out that NLG systems often use shortcuts, whereby one or more modules are trivialized, either by bypassing them (and the representations that they create) or by letting their operations be dictated by what the other modules expect (e.g., lexical choice may be trivialized by using a one-to-one mapping between semantic relations/predicates and lexical items). Mellish argues that shortcuts have a legitimate role in practical NLG when linguistic rules are missing, provided the existence of the shortcuts is acknowledged:
Even though they lead to diminished generality and maintainability, the unavailability added value in using abstract representations from which either a passive or an active choice, in which case one can be forgiven for explicitly specifying which sentences should be active and which ones passive, avoiding a pretense of linguistic sophis-tication. It is shortcuts of this kind that a template-based system is well placed to make, of course. But crucially, template-based systems do not have to use shortcuts any more than standard NLG systems: Where linguistic rules are available, both types of sys-tems can use them, as we have seen.
 information derived from corpora, as is increasingly more common in realization, but also for instance in aggregation (e.g., Walker, Rambow, and Rogati 2002). The point we want to make here, however, is that  X  X  X emplate-based X  X  systems may profit from such corpus-based approaches just as much as  X  X  X tandard X  X  NLG systems. The approach of
Langkilde and Knight (1998), for example, in which corpus-derived n -grams are used for selecting the best ones from among a set of candidates produced by overgenera-tion, can also be applied to template-based systems (witness the mixed template/ stochastic system of Galley, Fosler-Lussier, and Potamianos [2001]).
 perform all NLG tasks in a linguistically well-founded way and that more and more actually implemented systems of this kind deviate dramatically from the stereotypical systems that are often associated with the term template . Conversely, most standard
NLG systems perform many NLG tasks in a less than well-founded fashion (e.g., relying heavily on shortcuts, and nontransparent ones at that). We doubt that there is still any important difference between the two classes of systems, since the variation within each of them is as great as that between them. 22 Acknowledgments References
