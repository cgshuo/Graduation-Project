System architecture system's semantic modules , their role in the system, and their interactions; the term process information defined through an ontology with RDF or OWL annotations. ASSIST consists of three main communicating outline of ASSIST's architectural components is provided in Fig. 1 .

Before proceeding with the detailed description of system modules, we present in the following section the be addressed and how all these are mapped to the modules of the final system.
 2.1. CxCa research context and system speci fi cations including CxCa-related data that are geographically distributed and moreover contain syntactically and semantically heterogeneous information. An example of syntactic data heterogeneity between two research center databases regarding the notions of HPV infection and Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) gene polymorphism data in any structured format (e.g., XML or RDBs) but rather store it in plain text documents. integrating its data.

Passing over the issue of plain text storage, ASSIST provides the aforementioned integrated dataset by unifying isolated a  X  module.

The former is stored in the Medical Knowledge Base ( MKB ) module while the latter are provided by the Inference Engine module.

ASSIST exploits the achieved repository unification to provide medical researchers with an integrated environment for while the required statistical analysis is performed by the Association Study Analysis module.

Editor module . 2.2. Medical Knowledge Base (MKB)
The MKB contains all the medical knowledge in the domain of CxCa that is required to support the intended case of the ASSIST Ontology and the Medical Implication Rules. 2.2.1. ASSIST Ontology
The ASSIST Ontology 1 lies at the core of all the semantic technologies that have been employed by ASSIST. It models the domain of cervical cancer  X  to the best of our knowledge, the first ontology to attempt this language used to describe this knowledge is OWL-DL [10].
 as  X  continuants  X  ) and those that happen, unfold or develop in time (known as has certain structural overlap with the ACGT Master Ontology (ACGT-MO) [13] (e.g., Toxicity Level ), the Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS) [14] (e.g.,
Ontology for Biomedical Investigation (OBI) [15] (e.g., Biological Process providing specific entities for performing association studies in this domain.

Further design principles that have dictated the ontology organization include: (1) a clear distinction between use and hierarchy, (4) avoidance of multiple inheritance, and (5) avoidance of unnecessary these principles can be found in [13].
 The conceptual schema of the ontology is based on the notion of patient concerning a certain period of time, during which a diagnosis of a disease is medically meaningful
Visit s during which Medical Intervention s( Diagnostic Intervention etc.) may take place. The main Diagnostic Interventions of interest are the the Histology examination and the tHPV Test. Each Diagnostic Intervention is associated with a unified cancer, namely the CxCa Severity . However, for the purpose of performing an association study only one Case has to be
CxCa Severity. The classes and properties mentioned above constitute the
As it can be observed by investigation of the ASSIST Ontology, the classes contained therein can be classified into two categories: stored in typical medical repositories. Examples of this category include the following classes: Case, Visit, Medical Intervention, Diagnostic Intervention, Therapeutic Intervention, Result, etc.
 2.2.2. Medical Implication Rules
The Medical Implication Rules of MKB have been defined with guidance from CxCa experts in order to be used for inferring case  X  control association studies.

The Medical Implication Rules of the first type ( type-I rules from now on) are actually OWL-DL (Equivalent) Class Axioms different research centers and, second, to infer for each Case its associated CxCa Severity index. Regarding semantic schemes and also defines its own four-stage classification scheme properties) by the following formula:

In a similar manner, medical implication rules that assess the CxCa Severity index of each Case according to the ASSIST classification scheme have been defined with the help of DL. These rules consider the aggregate results of three distinct examination types (Cytology, Colposcopy, and Histology) conducted within the context of the Case. this type are expressed as construct queries in the SeRQL conducted within the Case is extracted ( Collective Cytology Result Diagnostic Intervention (Colposcopy, Histology, and HPV Test).

CxCa Severity index is ASSIST2, under the assumption that the patients with ASSIST3 index of worst Case have been already inferred, is expressed by the SeRQL query that is given in Listing 1 .

The Inference Engine is the module that provides all the required mechanisms for inferring medical information. It is twofold: (Section 1 ), and 2. to infer all the CxCa-related diagnostic information th at is required for the conduction of the intended case

 inferred information. This inference mechanism is mainly used to infer (1) for each Case the collective results of every examination type, and (2) the worst Case of a patient with respect to CxCa Severity index (see Section 2 ).
The two inference mechanisms described above need to be combined in order for the inference procedure of the system to be two inference mechanisms.

Repository Schema Mapping advanced authentication and authorization procedures are applied regarding both its end-users (LDAP-based passwords) and also the information exchange between legacy repositories and the system core (VPN protocol).
However, the most important aspect of the aforementioned recommendations has to do with the anonymity of the sensitive replacement of dates by timestamps) and pseudonymization (replacement of nominative information by pseudonyms and anonymization layer is applied at the Repository Schema Mapping module as an additional security measure.
Getting back to the description of the Repository Schema Mapping, the main purpose of the present module is to map the schema elements of the legacy repositories to entities of the ASSIST Ontology. The definition of these mappings requires MTHFR-related schema elements of the two clinics in Table 1 are both mapped onto the
The aforementioned mappings are defined manually through the mapping language of the D2RQ platform [26] and are stored and transform the retrieved information into RDF triples that instantiate entities of the ASSIST Ontology. 2.5. Uni fi ed Medical Repository (UMR)
The purpose of this module is to unify the medical information contained in the diverse legacy repositories into a single employs the ASSIST Ontology to express the heterogeneous CxCa-related information of the participating research centers. The construction of the UMR is achieved with the help of the Inference Engine and the Repository Schema Mapping modules.
First, the latter module undertakes the task of populating the UMR. I.e., the Repository Schema Mapping module produces procedure contains syntactically unified data.

Next, the Inference Engine takes over. The semantic data heterogeneity that stems from the use of diverse classification

This selection has been based mainly on Sesame's ability to handle large populated ontologies and on the (e.g., SPARQL) could be used as well for the implementation of the present module. 2.6.

The section concludes with a discussion regarding the system evaluation. 3.1. A prototype installation data from three pilot research centers, namely:  X

The UMR incorporates genetic information concerning 5 CxCa-suspicious polymorphisms: CYP1A1 (2018 persons), CYP2E1 (1974 persons), GSTM1 (1995 persons), GSTT1 (1995 persons), MTHFR (1981 persons), and p53
Codon72 (1973 persons). 3.2. Usage scenarios
The usage scenarios to be discussed constitute two sample case the system, since the presented studies are examples of actual contribution to CxCa research. 3.2.1. Scenario 1
Imagine the following case: Dr. X, who is a medical researcher in the CxCa domain, would like to use ASSIST in order to test whether there is an association between the presence of the MTHFR polymorphism and the onset of CxCa. The cases for this study will be patients with CxCa (ASSIST3), while the controls will be healthy individuals (ASSIST0).
Dr. X intends to perform the study on subjects from a single clinic (Papageorgiou Hospital). The scenario evolves as follows: determines the inclusion criteria for the case and control groups by selecting nodes from the displayed tree of medical
Then, the UI module uses the XML Query Schema to generate two ontology-compliant XML queries based on the user selections. latter module transforms the received XML queries into the corresponding SeRQL strings and consequently queries the UMR.
XML document is then passed to the UI. selected study factor(s). Then, she realizes that the case group includes only 4 patients and therefore no reliable or the case group, Dr. X decides to re-formulate the inclusion criteria in the two groups by considering patients from all three participating clinics. Steps 1 and 2 are revisited to revise the hypothesis and retrieve the new case and control groups. The Semantic Index &amp; Query module sends the study factor(s) and the XML-formatted case and control group data to the
The statistical results are forwarded to the UI, which displays them, thus completing the conduction of the association study.
 The performed analysis indicates that there is no statistically significant association between MTHFR and the onset of
CxCa (ASSIST3). However, the present usage scenario demonstrates how the testing of a meaningful association hypothesis ASSIST.

 3.2.2. Scenario 2 Imagine now that Dr. X would like to investigate whether the presence of the MTHFR polymorphism has an effect on High subjects from one clinic only (Charite Hospital) for her study. The scenario evolves as follows: selection procedure is completed, the UI module generates the XML queries for the case and control groups.

Steps 1, 2, and 3 of the present scenario are revisited in order to put through the new study. and ASSIST2, which has been ignored by the  X  scientifically sound 3.3. System evaluation
The utter goal of ASSIST is to allow medical researchers to conduct case ASSIST.

Owing to the wizard-style design of UI, the conduction of a complete association study requires only a few clicks and from 62.5 to 87.5 with a mean score of 74.7  X  which is considered above average [30] system response to user requests is essentially instant. 4.

 is updated manually by adding the schema mappings of the new repository. Then, the Repository Schema Mapping module employs the updated file to generate an extended UMR that incorporates the contents of the new repository. 4.2. Incorporation of new CxCa knowledge consequence, the mappings of the participating repositories to the modified ASSIST Ontology will also need to be revised. In order to extend ASSIST by adding new CxCa knowledge, we will start by modifying MKB with the help of the MKB Editor. Then, the Repository Schema Mappings file will be updated manually in accordance with the ontology modifications and the appropriately modified versions of the UI Tree and UI Path files. 4.3. Incorporation of new medical domains upgraded with new domain-specific analysis operations (e.g., database connectivity to retrieve information about domain-specific study factors  X  see Section 2.9).

According to the previous analysis, when a new medical domain has to be incorporated into ASSIST, the MKB is the first module to be modified; this could theoretically be performed by the MKB editor. However, given the extent of the ontology additions that would be probably needed in such a case, it might be wise to seek for alternative ontology development considered (e.g., concurrent [31] or modular ontology development [32]). After the MKB has been modified, the Repository module is modified so as to incorporate analysis operations required by the new domain.
The system module and configuration file modifications that are associated with the three extension directions are summarized in Table 4 . 5. Related work short description of ASSIST in mind, we must seek for related work in large-scale collaborative efforts to be used for performing specific medical research or healthcare tasks.
