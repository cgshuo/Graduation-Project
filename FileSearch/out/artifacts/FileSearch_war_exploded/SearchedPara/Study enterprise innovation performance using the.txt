 Technological innovat ion is the driving force of economic growth and success. A good innovation stems from good ideas, but the transcendence between creativity and reality is long and challenging. Patent can best describe the characteristics of the technology. We can even find enterprises dynamics though the further analysis of patent. Using social network to analyze patent can help us focus on the relationship from the perspec-tive of overall network structural instead of individual level. 
In the analysis of patent technology network, degree centrality, betweenness central-ity and cloneseness centrality are used as a basic tool is widely used. However, using these indicators alone as a basis has its shortcomings [1] . The connection strength has been operationalized as weights, bu t these indicators have only focused on connection weights, not on the number of ties, which is the central component of the original net-works. Therefore, in this study we select the theory of structural holes as the main mean of the analysis of patent net work.

The theory of structural holes based on concepts such as weak connectivity, network -centric, and unique exchange partner rights. In a social network, some individuals have a direct link, with the corresponding, some individuals are not directly linke d. At this time, a bridge which can connect two individuals that are unrelated is vital. Moreover, network. This phenomenon is known as the structure holes. The occupants of the struc-ture hole can get cumulative and non -repetitive information interests and control inter-ests. [2] 2.1 Literature review In figure 1, there are four structural holes marked by four red circles. For each structural hole, if t here is no ego node, nodes within the structure can not be linked to each other. We can also understand that it is because of the existence of ego node, nodes at both ends of the node ego can get accumulated rather than overlapping gains. Then we look at t he node itself, obviously it has more income than both ends of the nodes. If the nodes at both ends are connected at some point to each other, then for the ego node, its income will decline. So it is clear that the ego node on the entire network of informa tion dis-semination plays an important role.

This study hopes that through the above research we can help enterprises to precisely find their own position and find the difference with the world -class innovation enter-prises. At the same time, enterprises can find the best technology development model in order to better survive and develop in the competitive environment of the interna-tional market.

Based on literature of previous stu dies, patent networks can be usually divided into two types: patent citation network and patent co -occurrence network.

Generally in the study, scholars use patent citation network to identify core patents, or to find the most conducive of mutual partners, or identify the development trend of technology. However, by reading literature, we find some shortcomings of using patent citation networks[3]. First of all, the time difference between the patents can be reached for ten years, which will bring great diff iculties to the study. In addition, it is difficult for us to identify the relationship and characteristics of patents from the technical point of view, since the patent citation data has already considered the citation relationship of patents.

Patent co -o ccurrence analysis, which is the type of network used in this study. The purpose of scholars to study this network is often to extract information from the tech-nical analysis of the cluster, or to find a potential partner of similar technology. Patent co -o ccurrence network is the analysis of the relationship between the technologies rep-resented by the patent. The classification of patents is based on its own technical char-acteristics. In contrast to the citation analysis, the patent is based on a hierarchic al clas-sification system. This ensures that technical relationships are analyzed at different lev-els of technology, rather than a simple analysis between individual patents. In addition, patent co -occurrence analysis can avoid the error caused by the time -lag. This is be-cause when a patent is completed in the stage of application, we can just get the tech-nical classification information contained in the patent information.

Figure 2 descr ibes the basic form of patent co -occurrence network. Considering a complex patent network, there are many interconnected nodes. The connection strength between these nodes and the relationship between each other can be drawn into a net-work map. In this pic ture, each node represents an IPC. The connections between nodes in the graph represent the co -occurrence relationship between the two IPC. The thick-ness of the connection represents the strength of the co -occurrence relationship between the two patents wh ich is the number of co -occurrence. The thicker the connection is, the stronger the relevance between the two technologies are.

We summarize two common patterns of using the theory of structural holes to ana-lyze the patent co -occurrence network in the prev ious research.
 cooperative network between the inventors and analyze the technology transfer be-tween different inventors. They regard different inventors as different nod es in the net-work and the patents co -invented by the inventors is the connection between nodes. The thicker the connection between two nodes, the greater number of patents co -invented by two inventors. Scholars use this patent network to analyze the effici ency of cooper-ation between inventors. [4 -6]
In the second type, the main direction of the scholars' research is to apply the theory of structural holes to the technical cooperation network between enterprises. The con-tent of their research is the cooperat ive technology network between enterprises. In the cooperative network among enterprises, since the degree of communication between enterprises are different, the structural holes have formed. They consider different com-enterprise. This stream of research is based on the concept that enterprises in the coop-erative network occupying a favorable position can help to obtain external resources and external information. [7 -10] The second type which is mainly based on the coop-eration between enterprises to obtain the competitive advantage has been widely rec-ognized as a prerequisite. Scholars believe that the technical exchanges and product research and development cooperation a mong enterprises will help their own technol-ogy development.[11] This kind of cooperation among enterprises can help enterprises have more efficient access to knowledge and technology, thus broadening their own development prospects. These scholars seek th e position which the enterprise can get the maximum benefit.

In the past literature, we find that scholars have diverged for this second type of discussion. One party believes that in the enterprise cooperation network, enterprises occupying the position o f structural holes conducive to learn extra information.[13] They believe that in the center of the structure holes, the enterprise is more likely to get the maximum benefit. The enterprise as a middleman of two other enterprises which do not often connect can get more information sources. [12]Also known as it is in a strong information dominance. For this reason, an enterprise as a middleman role has a greater possibility of developing extremely innovative products. Another party believes that the enterpri ses in the position of structural holes, will bring unnecessary consumption which would lead to reducing the innovation.[14] However, these two research types have ignored the flow of technology within the enterprises. It is noteworthy that we must recogni ze that the enterprise's own technical creativity should be the most im-portant source of development and progress.[15]
From the perspective of knowledge to see the company, knowledge is an enterprise's most important strategic resources. What need to be re minded is that the premise of these theories is a reasonable and efficient internal knowledge flow and knowledge ex-change. Although the flow of knowledge is a regular activity within the enterprise, the rational and efficient level of knowledge flow is not free to achieve. Scholars believe that the structure holes in the enterprise's patent technology network have played roles as bridges. Structure holes can make several technologies with no direct contact obtain indirect technology exchange. At the same ti me, rich in structural holes in the patent network shows that there is blank field within the enterprise technology, which can However, the lack of structural holes in t he patent network shows that the internal tech-nical connection is extremely close, which may represent the enterprise in certain pro-fessional and technical field has already fully developed. [16]In sum, whether a patent network is rich in structural holes conducive to technological development, or lack of structural holes conducive to technological development is remained to consider. Therefore, this question will be explored in this study. This study focuses on the enter-prise's own patent level, in order t o find the most suitable structure for the enterprise's patent network, furthermore, enable enterprises to achieve the best innovative perfor-mance. So that the enterprise in this network structure, internal knowledge flows and technology integration can ac hieve the best condition. 2.2 Hypothesis p ro pose An enterprise's technological innovation is bound to remain in patent forming. Through patent applications, enterprises obtain the exclusive rights of the technology. Therefore, by analyzing the number of patent s that enterprises applied can effectively make us evaluate the level of technological innovation[17]. An obvious trend is that the bigger the number of patents is, the more work have been done of the firm for technological innovation, so there can be a st atistical relationship between the number of patents and the firm's innovation. Thus, we make the first hypothesis.
 H1: Patents are positively related to the enterprise performance.

The existence of structural holes can bring the knowledge of individual he terogene-ity, and the essence of knowledge innovation is the reorganization of knowledge. So we believe that innovation encourages individuals to occupy the position of structure holes. More importantly, because the position of structure holes controls the individual advantage, the nodes at both ends of the structural hole can not be separated from each other by connecting the structural holes.[18] This also means to a considerable extent that the structure holes of the network are not easy to disappear. Or we can say that the technology which now occupying the position of structure holes is likely to continue occupying the position of structure holes in the future.

H2: The Possibility of the technology which occupied structural holes X  position in the past st ill occupies the position is high.

According to the basic theory of structural holes, we can easily find that the technol-ogy that occupies the position of the structure holes is the important "middleman" of the technology around it. The existence of struct ural holes can help enterprises to gain better technology evolution, so we can assume that structural holes can help companies get better technology development. However, when there are too many structural holes in the enterprise's technology network, ther e is a lack of commonality between technol-ogies, which makes technology develop slowly. [19]As a result, we make the hypothe-sis 3.

H3: The relation between the structural holes and the enterprise innovation perfor-mance is inverse U -shape
Building upon social network view, we examine how a firm X  X  patent network affects technology creation when a firm has multiple structural holes in an inter -firm network. We tested our model with panel data onto 46 electronics technology firms between 2000 and 2015. In conclusion, this study argues that the efficiency of internal technol-ogy integration is closely related to the structure holes of the enterprise patent network. 3.1 Data The firm selected by this study are based on the Fortune 500 list of 2016. We choose the enterprises from the Fortune 500 which are in the electronics industry to be analyzed and studied. This study chooses the electronics industry as the research subject because innovation will show different looks in different industries. Therefore, in order to make the results of the study more significant, we identified the main body of the study as the most innovative industries  X  the electronics industry. We observe the patent activities of these firms from the year 2000, because data o nto these firms X  technologies licensing activities became active only after 2000.[20]
Enterprise performance data will be obtained from the annual report of the enterprise and the COMPUSTAT database. Enterprise patent data is from Derwent Innovations Index . This is a comprehensive international patent information database, which incor-porates Derwent World Patents Index X  and Derwent Patents Citation Index X . Derwent Innovations Index contains more than 14 million basic inventions and more than 2000 million pa tents. In some technical fields, the literature covered dates back to 1966. Der-went World Patents Index X  (Derwent WPI) is the most comprehensive database of value -added patent literature published in the world. Except for the DWPI data, Thom-son Innovation also includes 80 million patent information from more than 90 countries and regions, including data and raw data on patent information such as title information, PDF full text, legal status information and so on. Thomson Innovation provides com-prehensive p atent information for this study.

In the search of enterprise X  X  patents, we will encounter the situation that the target enterprise has a number of subsidiaries or has a used name. In order to make the patent search more accurately, this study uses Derwent 's patentee code as the basis of retrieval. In order to standardize the company name, the Derwent Innovations Index database specifies a 4 -character code for approximately 21,000 companies worldwide. The code is unique and can be used to retrieve all of th e company's subsidiaries and associated holding companies. In other words, through the enterprise code, we can find all the patent data belonging to this enterprise completely and accurately. Based on this, the study will first find the corresponding paten tee code in the Derwent Innovations Index database based on the selected firm. Then we use this patentee code to search all the patents applied by the enterprise. We use this method to avoid a business has a number of branches or has changed the name of th e enterprise which may bring the problem that the patent data is not accurate.

After tidying up and cleaning the patent data, we finally obtain a total of 46 firms X  data including patents and stock prices in the electronics industry during 2001 to 2015.Aft er we have accurate and complete enterprise patent data, we need to do the initial treatment. According to patent technology co -occurrence situation listed in the patent information, we make co -occurrence matrix for the next step in a detailed anal-ysis as shown in table 1.
 Each element is a frequency of the IPC code exists in each patent at the same time. For example, as in the Table 1, freq12 is the frequency of IPC1 and IPC2 appear in the same patent. 3.2 Measures Enterprise Innovation Performance . In this study, we use the DEA method to meas-ure firm innovation performance. The value of innovation performance is the efficiency in DEA defined to a ratio by dividing the innovation output of the enterprise by the year R &amp; D investment. Whether an enterprise's innovation is efficient is measured by whether the DEA value is greater than 1.
 The innovation output of the enterprise will be measured by a comprehensive index. We call it patented product industrialization variables. Patent results industrialization variables will include the following two aspects, namely, the number of patent appl ica-tions and the economic benefits of enterprises. The value of the patented product indus-trialization variable is equal to the number of DWPI patents divided by the year's share price. For the patent application section, we use more practical value of the DPWI data. This data is provided by the TI database. Therefore, this study suggests that DWPI data can bring more reliable conclusions which make this research more practical signifi-cance. For the part of the economic performance of enterprises, we use th e stock price of these listed enterprises. The meaning of stock price is the value of corporate assets. The share price also represents the expectations of outside investors for the company's future growth prospects. Therefore, the use of stock prices to m easure the most eco-nomic indicators of the enterprise not only can well reflect the profitability of the cur-rent business, it is a good reflection of the future development trend of enterprises. equivalent refers to the R&amp;D full -time staff workload and part -time staff according to the actual working hours converted the sum of the workload. R&amp;D funds internal ex-penditure refers to the actual expenses incurred by an enterprise in carrying out R&amp;D activities. The above two data can make a more comprehensive reflection of a business for technology research and development efforts. This study will o btain the above two data onto the listed companies X  annual reports and the COMPUSTAT database.
 Structural holes index. The measurement of structural holes uses the concept of con-straint put forward by Burt[2]  X 
Where Ci is network constraint on IPCi, and Cij is a measure of i X  X  dependence on contact j:
Where P ij is the proportion of IPCi X  X  network time and energy spent on contact j:
V ariable Z ij measures the strength of connection between contacts i and j, so the contact -specific constraint Cij varies from 0 to 1 with the extent to which i X  X  network time and energe is directly or indirectly spent on IPCj. Connection Z ij measures the lack of a structural hole. The higher the value of this indicator, the richer the structure holes in the enterprise patent network.
 Control variable. In order to improve the ac curacy of this study effectively, we will add some control variables to verify the hypothesis. By adding these control variables, we hope to make the comparison between different enterprises more scientific. Above all, the first control factor is the age o f the business. Enterprise age is from the estab-lishment of enterprises to 2015. The second controlling factor is the size of the firm. Here we use the logarithm of assets at the end of the year to measure the size of enter-prises. 3.3 Methodology The panel dat a for this study included patent data and performance data for 46 compa-nies from 2001 to 2015. In order to analyze these panel data, this study uses the panel data model to validate the above hypothesis. Poisson regression will be used in this study, which is consistent with the literature on management and innovation. In the previous literature, scholars often use the negative binomial model to do the patent re-search. Therefore, in this study, we will also use negative binomial regression model. Whether we choose the random effect model or the fixed effect model, the Hausman specification test will be used to determine the choice. After we complete the data processing and further obtain the co -occurrence matrix, we can carry out further anal ysis. Through the above method, this study is expected to have the following three major results as shown in figure 3. 4.1 Cluster analysis and patent map analysis of 46 companies year by year. We rank all patents on a yearly basis and cluster each year by category. According to the results of patent clustering year by year, we draw the electronics industry patent m ap, which we can get the annual development of hot technology changes. We hope that through the highly visible patent map to show the development of the electronics industry from 2001 to 2015. According to the patent data of successful companies in the ele ctronics industry, we can observe the overall development of the electronics industry. Furthermore, we can provide a more macro perspective to look at the problem. 4.2 Hypothesis verification The second part is hypothetical analysis. This study presents three main hypothesis, which are: H1: Patents are positively related to the enterprise performance
H2: The possibility of the technology which occupied structural holes X  position in the past still occupies the position is high.

H3: The relation between the struc tural holes and the enterprise innovation perfor-mance is inverse U -shape
In this part, we are going to find out whether these three hypothesis are true. 4.3 Index value interval A ccording to the above conclusion, we derive the third part of this study. In this final part, this study will seek the optimal structure of the patent network according to the size of the enterprise's own patent, so that the enterprise can obtain the great est innova-tion performance. From the perspective of complex networks, network nodes with more structural holes are more conducive to the dissemination of information. However, if correlation between technologies. If a company's technology is composed of com-pletely non -related technology, it is difficult to bring the scale of technology. Further-more, it is difficult to form a breakthrough in technological innovation. [21]Thu s, the size of a structural hole in an enterprise technology network should have the most ap-propriate range, rather than the simpler number. When an enterprise with a small num-ber of patents has too many structural holes in its patent network, the internal technol-ogy will be lack of common and fragmented, which the enterprise can not organize an efficient technical network. In this case, the enterprise can not organize a highly effi-cient technology network. On the contrary, when an enterprise with a large n umber of patents has too small structural holes in its patent network, which shows that the exist-ing technology companies are highly correlated. This situation shows that the enterprise technology has no room for outward expansion. It is an indirect descri ption of the low performance of enterprise innovation.

Therefore, according to enterprises X  own patent size, this study hopes to help to find a best structure holes X  value range, which can make the enterprises play its own tech-nological advantages. This is extremely practical significance. At this stage, this study focuses on the analysis of successful companies in the electron-ics industry, and the number of firms is only 46. This may result in one -sidedness of the results and not the most appro priate reflection of the industry's technology. There-fore, in the future work, we will join the enterprise which is not so successful or even failed in the electronics industry to analysis. We hope that with complete data support, the results of this study will be more scientific and accurate.
