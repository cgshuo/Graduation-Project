 This study creates a hybrid recommendation system for online offer personalization of an e-commerce company. The system goes beyond existing literature by combining four different data sources, i.e. customer data, product data, implicit and explicit behavioral data, in a single algorithm. Factorization machines are employed as model-based algorithm and have as advantage that the four data sources are incorporated in a single model by feature combination . Results show that hybridization of the four distinct data sources improves accuracy compared to (i) factorization machines based on a single data source and (ii) a real-life company benchmark model using collaborative filtering.
 Information Systems -Information retrieval -Retrieval tasks and goals -Recommender systems Algorithms, Performance, Experimentation Recommendation System, Factorization Machine, Hybrid Algorithm, Feature Combination Recommendation systems are nowadays commonly used to personalize a company X  X  online offer and communication. They take many forms and numerous typologies exist. A typical classification based on input data is proposed by [5 ] and [4 ]. These two studies identify four main system types. First, recommendation systems can be based on customer data (CD). These systems are called demographic recommendation systems . Second, content-based systems use product data (PD) and make recommendations based on similarity between product characteristics of items bought and other products not yet purchased by the customer. Third, knowledge-based systems use (real-time) information to recommend products. Fourth, collaborative filtering algorithms (CF) use prior explicit or implicit customer behavioral data (BD). CF identifies customers who exhibit the same behavior (nearest CF. Added value of combining different data sources is analyzed in terms of recall and computation time. The remainder of the study is divided as follows. In the related research section a brief overview of hybrid algorithms and an introduction to FMs is given. A third section discusses the components of the conducted analysis focusing on the data used and the algorithms calculated. Section 4 shows the results of the analysis. Finally section 5 concludes and identifies paths for future research. In recent years, a lot of studies successfully focus on creating hybrid models combining different data sources. Overviews are given by [ 5], [1], and [ 4]. Most contributions to literature combine BD and PD, or CF and content-based systems [ 3; 6; 15 ; 19], but hybridization of BD and CD is investigated as well [ 15; 19]. Combination of CD and PD [7 ], without BD is less investigated in literature. Combinations of two out of four different identified data sources are already investigated in literature, nevertheless the hybridization of all four data sources remains uninvestigated. Therefore this study incorporates the four distinct data sources and shows the added value of this unique combination. Next to data sources used, hybrid algorithms are characterized by the hybridization method. Burke [5 ] distinguishes between seven combination methods; weighting, switching, mixing, cascading, feature augmentation, meta-level, and feature combination. Whereas the first six techniques calculate distinct models for each data source and combine results afterwards, feature combination includes different data sources in a single algorithm. Many different algorithms using feature combination are developed to integrate two out of the four identified data sources [3 ; 16; 18]. In this study we integrate all four data sources using feature combination. More specific a factorization machine, as discussed in the next section, is proposed to incorporate the four distinct data sources. In recent years many new state-of -the-art model-based algorithms are created [ 2; 8]. One of these techniques,  X  X actorization machines X  (FM), first introduced by [ 17], is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and factorization models and combines the advantages of both . Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. Main reason of this interesting property is the fact that variable interaction is calculated based on factorized parameters. Thi s allows to calculate the model in linear time.
 Compared to factorization models, like SVD++ [ 13 ], FM works with any real valued feature vector. This advantage gives the opportunity to include different types of BD, PD, and CD as predictors. The general model equation of a FM of degree 2 is formulated as follows: In equation 1  X   X  represent the predictors being BD, PD, and/or CD.  X  is the global bias and  X   X  are the parameters related to first degree effect of the n predictors.  X   X   X  , X   X   X  represents the dot product of  X   X  only a history of two months is considered for purchases and one month for internal search, view, and add to cart. Customer and product data are up-to -date and collected at time t. Based on internal analysis of customer purchase cycles, the target, customer viewing a product at time t and buying a product afterwards, is set to two weeks. To calculate the model a train and test period are constructed independently from each other. This gives the opportunity to create an out of period test of the calculated algorithms. In total four model variations based on the FM technique are calculated. Three models, FM PD , FM CD , and FM BD , are only based on a single data source being PD, CD, and BD respectively. These models are compared to a hybrid FM, FM PD/CD/BD , that combines all different data sources in a single algorithm. The four factorization machines are benchmarked against an algorithm currently deployed by the company to make recommendations. This benchmark model (CF) is an item-based CF algorithm based on cosine similarity and kNN. The user-item input matrix (M) is based on a weighted combination of implicit behavioral data and for each element m ui of the matrix the value is defined as follows: In equation 2 U and I represent the number users and items respectively.  X   X  X  X 1 ,  X   X  X  X 1 , and  X   X  X  X 1 denote purchase, addition to cart and view the day before the recommendation. P , A , and V symbolize purchase in the last two months without t-1, addition to cart, and view in the last month without t-1. The results of the different algorithms on the two distinct product categories are evaluated in terms of recall [ 10]. Recall@5 till recall@100 are evaluated in steps of 5. The average model rankings are shown in Table 2.
 Ranking 1 2.38 2.77 3.95 4.90 A Friedman test, including recall as dependent variable, algorithm as independent variable, and selection size -product category combinations as cases, shows that algorithm variation has an impact on accuracy (  X  4 2 = 56.97, p &lt; 0.001). A post-hoc pairwise comparison is executed using Holm X  X  and Nemenyi X  X  procedures [9 ]. Results show that the hybrid algorithm (FM PD/CD/BD ) outperforms all other FMs and the CF benchmark. FM BD and CF are not significantly differing from each other but obtain better results compared to FM CF and FM PD . The latter model (FM PD ) performs significantly worse compared to all other algorithms. The In this study a model-based technique, FM, proposed by [17 ] is extended by including implicit BD, CD, and PD. Results show that prediction hybridization of BD, CD, and PD outperforms all single data source FMs as well as the benchmark CF algorithm. The hybrid model is therefore an interesting model for personalization of online product offerings. FM PD and FM CD are the least computationally intensive algorithms followed by CF and FM BD and FM PD/CD/BD . FM models are more scalable during the computation stage which is beneficial in settings with huge data. Although results are satisfying, the FM technique is not compared to other hybrid algorithms incorporating all four data sources. Therefore including a benchmark making use of these sources would be interesting. Concretely, parallel to the model proposed in this study, a hierarchical CF algorithm is being developed. This CF algorithm incorporates data reduction as preprocessing, item-based CF, and cosine similarity for kNN. The proposed model is deployed on each distinct input data source (CB, PB, implicit-, and explicit BD) separately and a posteriori individual recommendations are combined using a parametrized combination technique. The optimal combination technique will be based on different experiments still to be executed. Performance of the algorithms is only evaluated in terms of recall. Other performance measures exist [ 10 ] and could be incorporated . Beyond theoretical metrics, an evaluation could be based on click rates, conversion rates, sales, turnover, and satisfaction. To extend evaluation, the three models  X  hybrid FM, hierarchical CF, company benchmark CF  X  will be evaluated and compared based on theoretical measures for accuracy, diversity, and computation time, but will also be tested in a real-life setting. In a first stage, a personalized email communication A/B test including the three proposed algorithms will be performed. Evaluation of this test will go beyond theoretical performance measures and incorporates click rates, conversions, sales, revenue, and even satisfaction. Based on the results of the email tests, algorithms could be deployed to make real-time recommendations for the webshop. [1] Adomavicius, G. and Tuzhilin, A., 2005.
