 This tutorial aims to provide a unifying account of current research on diversity and novelty in different IR domains, namely, in the context of search engines, recommender sys-tems, and data streams.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  search process Relevance, Diversity, Novelty, Ambiguity, Redundancy
Information retrieval has been traditionally approached as a pursuit of relevant information, under the assumption that the users X  information needs are unambiguously conveyed by their information requests. While such an assumption may have arguably held in the library setting where the early studies of relevance-oriented ranking were conducted, it does not hold in general, and it is unlikely to hold in particular for the multitude of users X  needs in modern information retrieval systems, such as search engines and recommender systems. In order to identify relevant information under the uncer-tainty posed by the users X  requests, an effective approach is to diversify the retrieved results. By doing so, an IR sys-tem can minimise the chance of wrongly guessing the users X  needs, which may cause the users to abandon their retrieval task.

Through a stream of active research and experiences, di-versity and novelty can be said to have by now consolidated into a significant body of techniques, methodologies, the-ories, and knowledge in the field of information retrieval. This tutorial aims to provide a unifying account of current research on diversity and novelty in different IR domains. In
