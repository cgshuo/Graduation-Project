 CIS, University of Munich number of orthographic and grammatical errors occur in Web documents. In this article we in-methods are developed for efficiently detecting erroneous pages and for marking orthographic knowledge bases automatically retrieved from the Web. 1. Introduction The automated analysis of large corpora has many useful applications (Church and
Mercer 1993). Suitable language repositories can be used for deriving models of a given natural language, as needed for speech recognition (Ostendorf, Digalakis, and Kimball 1996; Jelinek 1997; Chelba and Jelinek 2002), language generation (Oh and Rudickny 2000), and text correction (Kukich 1992; Amengual and Vidal 1998;
Strohmaier et al. 2003b). Other corpus-based methods determine associations between words (Grefenstette 1992; Dunning 1993; Lin et al. 1998), which yields a basis for com-puting thesauri, or dictionaries of terminological expressions and multiword lexemes (Gaizauskas, Demetriou, and Humphreys 2000; Grefenstette 2001).
 1991; Kupiec 1993; Kumano and Hirakawa 1994; Boutsis, Piperidis, and Demiros 1999;
Grefenstette 1999). The analysis of technical texts is used to automatically build dictio-naries of acronyms for a given field (Taghva and Gilbreth 1999; Yeates, Bainbridge, and
Witten 2000), and related methods help to compute dictionaries that cover the special vocabulary of a given thematic area (Strohmaier et al. 2003a). In computer-assisted lan-guage learning (CALL), mining techniques for corpora are used to create individualized and user-centric exercises for grammar and text understanding (Schwartz, Aikawa, and Pahud 2004; Brown and Eskenazi 2004; Fletcher 2004a).
 a very low frequency. Furthermore, the number of text genres and special thematic areas that come with their own picture of language is large. This explains that most of the aforementioned applications can only work when built on top of huge heteroge-neous corpora. Since the Web represents by far the largest public repository for natural pages where language material of a given orthographic, grammatical, or thematic kind is found, many recent experiments and technologies use the Web as a corpus (Kehoe and
Renouf 2002; Morley, Renouf, and Kehoe 2003; Kilgarriff and Grefenstette 2003; Resnik and Smith 2003; Way and Gough 2003; Fletcher 2004b).
 words and phrases occurring in Web pages are sometimes erroneous. Typing errors represent one widespread phenomenon. Many Web pages, say, in English, are written by non-native speakers, or by persons with very modest language competence. As a consequence, spelling errors and grammatical bugs result. The character sets that are language, which represents another systematic source for inaccuracies. Furthermore, a small number of texts found in the Web is obtained via optical character recognition (OCR), which may again lead to garbled words. As a consequence of these and other error sources, the Web contains a considerable number of  X  X ad X  pages with language material that is inappropriate for corpus construction.
 inadequacies. While the problem is probably not too serious for approaches that merely naries and related linguistic knowledge bases X  X hich are, after all, meant to be used in different scenarios of automated language processing X  X ecomes problematic if too many erroneous entries are retrieved from Web pages. Obviously, in computer-assisted language learning it is a principal concern that words and phrases from the Web that are presented to the user are error free.
 in Web pages for distinct applications are broadly acknowledged (see also Section 4.4 of
Kilgarriff and Grefenstette [2003]). Still, to the best of our knowledge, a serious analysis of the frequency and distribution of orthographic errors in the Web is missing, and no general methods have been developed that help to detect and exclude pages with too many erroneous words. In this article we first report on a series of experiments that try to answer the following questions: 1. What are important types of orthographic errors found in Web pages? 2. How frequent are errors of a given kind? For a given error level 3. How do these figures depend on the language, on the thematic area,
We then look at the problem indicated above. 4. Which methods help to automatically detect Web pages with many 296 and German corpora from the Web, using suitable queries to Web search engines. In our error statistics we wanted to distinguish between (1)  X  X eneral X  Web pages collected without any specific thematic focus on the one hand and Web pages from specific thematic areas on the other hand, and (2) between Web pages written in HTML and pora was collected that are composed of PDF documents. Details are provided in Section 2.

Special Vocabulary. Web pages often contain tokens that do not belong to the standard vocabulary of the respective language. Typical categories are, for example, special names, slang, archaic language, expressions from foreign languages, and special ex-pressions from computer science/programming. Classification and detection of special vocabulary is outside the scope of the present article. Since sometimes a clear separation between special vocabulary and errors is difficult, we briefly come back to this problem in Section 5.4.

Proper Errors. Focusing on garbled standard vocabulary, tokens may be seriously dam-aged in an  X  X nexplainable X  way. Most of the remaining errors can be assigned to one of the four classes mentioned above: error dictionaries were built. These dictionaries, which only list garbled words of a given language that do not accidentally represent correct words, try to cover a high number of the conventional errors of each type that are typically found in Web Section 4.
 remain undetected because they do not occur in the error dictionaries. We also estimate the percentage of correct tokens of the corpora that are erroneously treated as errors since they appear in the error dictionaries. Our results show that the number of tokens of a text that appear in the error dictionaries can be considered as a lower approximation of the number of real orthographic errors.
 error dictionaries. Section 7 summarizes the most important differences that arise when results that illuminate the relationship between the error rate of a document and its genre.
 from perfect documents to a small number of clearly unacceptable pages. This moti-vates the design of filters that efficiently recognize and reject pages with an error rate beyond a user-specified threshold. The construction of appropriate filters is described the figures obtained in Section 6 with the corresponding figures for filtered corpora. Web pages.
 veloped in the article may in fact help to improve corpus-based methods. The general question of how deeply distinct methods from computational linguistics based on Web corpora are affected by orthographic errors in Web pages and to what extent the meth-ods developed in the article help to remedy these deficiencies are too complex to be discussed here.
 where we also comment on future work and on some practical difficulties one has to face when collecting and analyzing large corpora from the Web. 2. Corpora
The basis for the evaluations described below is a collection of corpora, each composed of Web pages retrieved with Web search engines (Google/AllTheWeb). In order to graphic errors, all corpora were built up in two variants. The English and German variant, respectively, contain Web pages that were classified as English and German Web pages by the search engine. As described above, for both languages we collected general corpora with Web pages without any thematic focus and, in addition, corpora that cover five specific thematic areas to be described below. Statements on the  X  X epresentative-corpora retrieved with Web search engines depends on the kind of queries that are used, on the ranking mechanisms of the engine, and on the details of the collection strategy. We mainly concentrated on simple queries and straightforward collection strategies.
Still, the large number of subcorpora and pages that were evaluated should guarantee that accidental results are avoided. 2.1 General Web Corpora
In a first attempt, we tried to obtain a general German HTML corpus using the mean-
Google X  X  ranking mechanism, which prefers  X  X uthorities X  (Brin and Page 1998), mainly portals of big organizations, companies, and others were retrieved. These pages are often dominated by graphical elements. Portions of text are usually small and carefully edited, which means that orthographic errors are less frequent than in other  X  X ess official X  pages.
 lecting five terms of the 10,000 top frequent German words. We used Google to retrieve 298 10 pages per query (quintuple) until we obtained 1,000 pages. A considerable number of the URLs were found to be inactive. After conversion to ASCII and a preliminary analysis of error rates with methods described below, some of the remaining pages were found to contain very large lists of general keywords, including many orthographic errors. Apparently these lists and errors were only added to improve the ranking of the page in search engines, even for ill-formed queries. We excluded these pages. The remaining documents represent the  X  X rimary X  general German HTML corpus. Since we wanted to know how results depend on the peculiarities of the selected set of pages, a second series of queries of the same type was sent to Google to retrieve a  X  X econdary X  general German HTML corpus with a completely disjoint set of pages.

HTML corpus, a general German PDF corpus, and a general English PDF corpus. The translation from PDF to ASCII was found to be error prone, in particular for German documents (cf. Gartner 2003). Due to this process, some converted PDF documents were seriously damaged. Since we focus on errors in original Web pages (as opposed to converted versions of such pages), these files were excluded as well. We found these pages when computing error rates based on error dictionaries as described in Sections 6 and 7.
 of standard letters only) in the resulting six corpora are shown in Table 1. Numbers (1) and (2) stand for the primary and secondary corpora, respectively. 2.2 Web Corpora for Specific Thematic Areas
We looked at the thematic areas  X  X iddle Ages, X   X  X olocaust, X   X  X ish, X   X  X ushrooms, X  and  X  X eurology. X  The given selection of topics tries to cover scientific areas as well as history and hobbies.

Simple Crawl. A first series of corpora was collected by sending a query with 25  X  X erminological X  keywords mechanically found in a small corpus of the given area to the AllTheWeb search engine and collecting the answer set. For example, the queries were respectively used for collecting the corpora Mushrooms E and Neurology E. The ranking mechanism of AllTheWeb prefers pages containing hits for several keywords of a disjunctive query. Since this form of corpus construction is straightforward, not all pages in the resulting corpora belong to the given thematic area.

Refined Crawl. We wanted to see how results are affected when using less naive crawl-ing methods. For the three areas  X  X ish, X   X  X ushrooms, X  and  X  X eurology, X  the sec-ondary corpora were retrieved using the following refined procedure: Starting from a small tagged seed corpus for the given domain, we mechanically extracted termino-logical open compounds for English (Sornlertlamvanich and Tanaka 1996; Smadja and
McKeown 1990) and compound nouns for German. Examples are amino group, action (English, mushrooms), Koffeinstoffwechsel, and Eisenkonzentration (German, neurology). collected a maximum of 30 top-ranked hits (many answer sets were smaller). For each document in the resulting corpus, the similarity with the seed corpus was controlled, using a cosine measure (in practice, almost all documents passed the similarity filter).
Our method can be considered as a variant of Baroni and Bernardini X  X  (2004) and leads to corpora with a strong thematic focus.

The numbers indicate one interesting effect: Documents in the thematic corpora obtained with the refined crawling strategy turned out to be typically rather short. Since we only used the 30 top-ranked documents for each single query, this probably points to a special feature of Google X  X  ranking mechanism. A manual inspection of hundreds insights. 3. Error Detection
For detecting orthographic errors of a particular type in texts, two naive base methods may be distinguished. 1. A representative list of errors of the respective type is created and 2. A spell checker or a large-scale dictionary is used to detect  X  X uspicious X 
For large corpora, both methods have serious deficiencies. With Method 1, only a small number of errors. When using Method 2, the number of tokens that have to be manually 300 checked becomes too large. In practice, a large number of error candidates represent vocabulary found in Web pages, as mentioned in the introduction.
 compromise between the above two approaches. As a starting point, we took stan-dard dictionaries of English, D ( English ); German, D ( German ); French, D ( French ); nary of proper names, D ( Names ); and a dictionary of abbreviations and acronyms,

 used in the experiments described later. First, for each of the four error types mentioned above we manually collected a number of general patterns that  X  X xplain X  possible mutations from correct words to erroneous entries. In a second step, these patterns were used to garble the words of the given background dictionaries. Third, garbled words that were found to correspond to correct words (entries of the above dictionaries) were excluded ( filtering step ). Collecting the remaining erroneous strings, we obtained large error dictionaries for each type of orthographic error.
 part of all orthographic errors occurring in the English and German Web pages. At the same time, the number of tokens that are erroneously treated as errors due to the unavoidable incompleteness of the filtering step remains acceptable. On this basis, an estimate of the number of conventional orthographic errors occurring in Web pages is possible, counting the number of occurrences of entries of the error dictionaries. we comment on these points, we describe the construction of the error dictionaries in more detail. In the remainder of the article, by D conventional dictionaries listed above. 4. Construction of Error Dictionaries
For the construction of error dictionaries, the most important error patterns for each type of error were determined. For typing errors and errors caused by character en-coding problems, error patterns were obtained analytically. For spelling errors and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) errors, important mutation patterns were col-lected empirically. As a general rule, all error dictionaries were restricted to entries of names, and abbreviations, and it is difficult to mechanically distinguish between this special kind of vocabulary and errors. 4.1 Error Dictionaries for Typing Errors
Typing errors can be partitioned into transpositions, deletions, substitutions, and inser-tions. Transpositions of two letters occur if two keys are hit in the wrong order. Deletions result if a key is not properly pushed down. Substitutions occur if a neighbor key is pressed down instead of the intended one. Horizontal and vertical shifts of fingers may be distinguished. If a finger hits the middle between two keys, a neighbor key may be pressed in addition to the intended one. The wrong letter may occur before or after the correct letter.

 exclusively composed of standard letters (as opposed to digits and other special sym-bols) were taken into account. Furthermore, since typing errors in general do not affect the first letter of a word, 3 we left this letter unmodified. We analyzed the number of mutated variants of a given word. Both for the American and for the German keyboard we have approximately 16 l variants for a word of length l . This shows that the above patterns for typing errors are very productive. It is not possible to garble all the words of our background dictionary for constructing the error dictionaries. For the generation entries of the English background dictionary with the highest frequency. Applying the above mutation patterns we generated 10,785,675 strings. After removal of duplicates dictionary D err ( English,typing ).

D err ( German,typing ). Since the average length of German words is large, we obtained 13, 656, 866 entries. 4.2 Error Dictionaries for Spelling Errors
English. In order to find the most characteristic patterns for English spelling errors, a bootstrapping procedure was used to compute an initial list of errors. We started with the misspelled English words verry, noticable, arguement ,and inteligence . For each term we retrieved 20 Web documents. After conversion to ASCII we computed the list of all normal tokens occurring in these documents. The resulting list was sorted by frequency, and words in D conv were filtered out. After a manual selection of new errors with high
Google counts, the procedure was iterated until we did not find new erroneous words with high frequency. During the bootstrapping procedure, we also found Web pages that listed some  X  X ommon misspelled words X  of English. The most frequent errors mentioned in these lists were also added. Table 4 presents some strings that were found with a large number of Google hits. 4 introducing one error at the first possible position, for each entry of the appropriate form. As a result we obtained a list with 1,223,128 garbled strings. After applying the standard filtering procedure, we obtained the dictionary D spelling errors with 1,202,997 entries.

German. Similarly as for English, we built an initial error list. Bootstrapping was started shows some of the resulting German words, the misspelled variant, and the number of Google hits of the garbled version. From the initial error list, we obtained a set of 65 rules partially described in Table 7. We applied these rules to D ( German ), introducing one error for each entry of the appropriate form. Each rule was applied to each entry using the first possible position for mutation. For example, for the lexical entry Adresse of the German standard dictionary we obtained the following error terms: adrese, ahdresse, adrehsse, addresse, adrresse . As a result we obtained a list with 19, 265, 271 strings. The not restricted by word context. The filtering procedure led to an error dictionary with 18, 970, 716 entries.
  X  304 4.3 Error Dictionaries for OCR Errors
As a starting point we used a list of typical OCR errors that we found in a corpus with 200 pages of OCR output (Ringlstetter 2003). Error types are shown in Table 8.  X   X  p  X  t  X  y  X  v  X  c  X  c  X  1
English. The error dictionary D err ( English,ocr ) was generated by applying to the en-
D ( English ) with its 315, 300 entries led to a list of 1,697,189 entries. The filtering pro-cedure where we erase words from D conv led to the error dictionary D with 1, 532, 741 entries. Table 9 shows some of the most frequent English words, the transformation result, and the number of Google hits of the garbled variant.
German. When scanning German texts, vowels  X  a,  X  o ,and  X  u are often replaced by occurs as the result of a character encoding problem (see below). Since we wanted to avoid having our statistics for OCR errors being heavily overloaded with errors typical OCR errors for German texts. This means that we applied to D ( German )the transformation rules mentioned in Table 8. The transformation of D ( German )withits
German words, the transformation result, and the number of Google hits of the garbled variant.

In character sets used for the encoding of Web pages, often the German letters following the substitution scheme ( e-transformation ):
In other Web pages, the aforementioned vocals are replaced using the following scheme:

The numbers show that misspellings caused by e-transformation are a widespread phenomenon. Note that the quality of PDF corpora is much better in this respect.
 ( s-transformation ). For two reasons, the distinction between  X  and ss is a delicate matter.
Since the Swiss spelling is ss , a string representing an erroneous German word may be a correct Swiss word. To make things even more complicated, the correct spelling of many
German words has been changed during the so-called  X  X echtschreibereform X  some years ago, which affected the selection between  X  and ss (e.g., Mi X verst  X  andnis became follows, a token written with ss that is officially written with  X  is treated as an error. variants) in the German dictionary were replaced by their images under the respective transformation. Letter  X  occurring in the entries was categorically replaced by ss . For the e-transformation we obtained a list of 436, 198 strings. The filtering procedure led to an error dictionary D err ( German, enc-e ) with 432, 987 entries.
 dictionary D err ( German,enc-) with 407, 013 entries. A considerable number of well-formed words was generated and filtered out. The rules of German morphology yield a partial explanation: For so-called strong verbs some paradigmatic forms only differ by a mutation of vowels ( m  X  ochte-mochte ).
 German dictionary entries without occurrences of vocals  X  has 42, 340 entries. 4.5 Summary and Maximal Error Dictionaries
Using the union of all error dictionaries for both languages, we constructed the maximal of all error dictionaries. 5. Error Overproduction and Underproduction error dictionaries, we comment on the limitations of this kind of analysis. Obviously, dictionary might in fact be correct words (overproduction) due to the incompleteness of 308 the final filtering step in the construction of the error dictionaries. From the construction of the error dictionaries we may expect that incompleteness/underproduction is mainly caused by
For both English and German, to estimate under/overproduction of the error dictio-naries, the primary general HTML corpus was split into four subclasses. The class
Best contains all documents where the number of hits (tokens representing entries of the maximal error dictionary) per 1,000 tokens is  X  1. For class Good (Bad, Worst, respectively), the number of hits per 1,000 tokens is 1 X 5 (5 X 10, &gt; 10, respectively). The number of documents in each class is found in Tables 13 and 14. 5.1 Estimating Underproduction To estimate underproduction of the English error dictionaries, the English general
HTML corpus was split into subfiles, each containing 300 tokens. We then randomly we wanted to avoid an unbalanced selection where most errors are from the doc-ument class Worst, a maximum of three errors from each subfile was used for the analysis. Error candidates were found with the help of a spell checker and using our standard dictionaries as a second control. Slang and special vocabulary were not used for the statistics. We also excluded errors where two words were merged. We found that most of the latter errors were caused by the conversion process from
HTML to ASCII. Each candidate was manually controlled; in difficult cases we con-sulted Merriam-Webster Online. We continued the search until 1,000 proper errors were isolated. From these, 624 (62 . 4%) turned out to be entries of the maximal English error dictionary.
 of errors found in the error dictionary for the four quality classes of documents. As a tendency, recall of the error dictionary is better in  X  X ad X  documents.
 errors in the German general HTML corpus, 638 (63 . 80%) were found in the maximal presented in Table 14. 5.2 Estimating Overproduction
In our first experiment with English texts we found that a considerable number of hits corresponded to special names introduced in the documents. Many of these names are artificial (e.g., Hitty ). In order to avoid all difficulties with special names we decided to restrict the error analysis in English texts to words starting with a lowercase letter. manually checked which of these tokens represent correct words, reading contexts and consulting Merriam-Webster Online in difficult cases.
 proper errors is larger in documents with a large number of hits. In the class Worst, 95% of all hits are proper errors; in the class Best, only 60% of the hits represent orthographic errors. Most of the remaining hits could be assigned to one of the following categories: correct standard expressions (missing entries of the standard dictionaries), names and geographic expressions, foreign language expressions, archaic and literary word forms, and abbreviations. The number of hits in each category is found in Table 15. The large number of standard words among the hits in the class Best is caused by an incomplete-ness of our English dictionary, which does not always contain both the British and the American spelling variants.
 to tokens starting with a lowercase letter, a more shallow picture is obtained (Table 16). proper errors), results are similar to the English case and confirm the above-mentioned general tendency. Due to the large number of names, foreign language expressions, and archaic/literary word forms that are found in class Bad, we here have only 56% proper errors. The results show that overproduction could be considerably reduced when filter-ing error dictionaries with better standard dictionaries for geographic entities, personal names, foreign language expressions, and archaic and literary word forms.
 310 5.3 Summary So Far
From the above percentages we obtain a naive estimate for the ratio between the real number of errors and the number of hits of the error dictionaries, which is presented in
Table 17. The results show that the number of hits can be seen as a lower approximation of the real number of errors. The ratio between both numbers is larger for English. It does not differ dramatically between the distinct quality classes. However, since both over-and underproduction are larger for  X  X ood X  documents, error estimates for these classes come with a larger degree of uncertainty. 5.4 Difficulties
The above analysis turned out to be much more time-consuming and difficult than it might appear. One problem is caused by the fact that nonstandard vocabulary and errors do not represent disjoint categories. Orthographic errors are sometimes  X  X bused X  as slang expressions. A separation between archaic/foreign language expressions and orthographic errors is often only possible when taking the sentence context into account. These and other examples explain that demarcation issues are sometimes expressions, special names, and archaic word forms represents an important step the error dictionaries, overproduction may probably be reduced in a significant way.
Furthermore, these dictionaries should help to detect Web pages with nonstandard vocabulary of a particular type.
 6. Distribution of Orthographic Errors in the General HTML Corpora
We d e fi n e t h e error rate of a text with respect to an error dictionary D number of entries of D err that are found among 1,000 tokens of the text. In this section we describe the distribution of error rates for all types of errors in the general HTML corpora. Experiments for other corpora are summarized in the following section. The results of the previous section indicate that the error rate represents a reasonable lower approximation for the real number of errors per 1,000 tokens in the document. Incom-pleteness of the rule sets for generating spelling errors and OCR errors should be kept in mind. Recall that in English documents, only words starting with a lowercase letter are taken into account. 6.1 Distribution of Error Rates for Orthographic Errors
In the first test, we consider orthographic errors, that is, errors of arbitrary type. Ac-cordingly, error rates for documents are computed with respect to the maximal error dictionaries. For a coarse survey, as in the previous section, we distinguish four quality intervals [0, 1), [1, 5), [5, 10), and [10,  X  ).

English. The histograms in Figure 1 show the percentage of documents in each class in the primary (left-hand side) and secondary (right-hand side) English corpora. Remark-ably, the differences between the two corpora are almost negligible. In both cases, most documents belong to class Best; only a small percentage of documents belongs to classes Bad and Worst.
 relation between document length and error rates, with the following eye-catching exception: small (larger) documents of an excellent quality tend to have an error rate 0 (close to 0, but &gt; 0). 5 In order to avoid a dominating influence of long documents, we simply computed the arithmetic mean of all error rates obtained for the single documents. The class Best 80% collects 80% of all documents with lowest error rate, and similarly for the class Best 90%.
 (2.47, 2.24, respectively) and the means for the Best 80% classes (0.67, 0.68, respectively).
These numbers point to an effect that will be found again in other figures and exper-iments: The large majority of all documents in the corpora have a very good quality.
Yet, at the  X  X ad end X  of the spectrum we find a considerable number of unacceptable documents with a very large number of errors. The phenomenon becomes even more apparent in Figure 2 (left diagram) where we depict the error rates of all documents. In what follows we often describe mean error rates for all documents and for the class
Best 80%. When comparing distinct corpora, the two values help to see if deviations concern the class of all documents or if they are rather caused by a small number of  X  X ad X  documents.
 secondary corpora are almost identical. This gives at least some evidence to the conjec-312 ture that for corpora crawled with similar queries and collection strategies, error rates will not differ too much. As we see next, the situation for the German corpora is more complex.

German. The histogram in Figure 3 shows the percentage of documents in each class of the primary (left-hand side) and secondary (right-hand side) German corpora. A large number of documents belongs to class Good. We now find a larger difference between the primary and secondary corpora. Several phenomena might be responsible.
As mentioned above, for the German corpora we did not restrict the analysis to tokens starting with a lowercase letter. Hence, documents with many names can cause special effects and lead to differences between corpora. Second, errors caused by encoding of special characters represent an important extra source for errors in German docu-ments where numbers may vary from one corpus to another. This is seen in Table 20 where we analyze all error types occurring in the primary and secondary German corpus. The means for e-transformation are 0.62 for the primary corpus and 1.40 for the secondary corpus.
 corpus, which are presented in Table 19, show that in Figure 2 (right diagram). The two curves of the figure show that despite the afore-mentioned differences between English and German, basic features of the error rate distribution are very similar. 6.2 Error Rates for Particular Error Classes
Typographic Errors. The most widespread subclass of errors found in the corpora (93 . 5%) can be classified as typing errors. 6 The percentage is lower in the German corpus (2 . 15 / 3 . 86, 55 . 7%) where e-transformation, -transformation, and s -transformation rep-resent additional important sources for errors (see below). In absolute numbers, error rates for typographic errors observed in the two corpora are similar.
 typographic errors in the four intervals [0, 1), [1, 5), [5, 10), and [10, and secondary English corpora (upper diagrams of Figure 4) and the corresponding
German corpora (lower diagrams of Figure 4). Note again the close similarity between curves obtained for orthographic errors in Figure 2, are omitted.

Spelling Errors. The two diagrams in Figure 5 show that the error rates found in the primary English corpus (mean 0 . 39) are similar to the ones found in the primary
German corpus (mean 0 . 45). The results presented in Section 5.1 indicate that our error dictionaries for spelling errors are incomplete. Hence the real number of spelling errors is probably larger. We also computed error rates for spelling errors in the secondary 314 graphic errors was confirmed: the difference between the two English corpora (mean 0 . 39 versus mean 0 . 38) is negligible; for the two German corpora, the difference is larger (mean 0 . 45 versus mean 0 . 58).
 OCR Errors. The diagrams in Figure 6 show that most documents do not contain any
OCR errors. Of course this result is not surprising. Probably not all errors that contribute to the two diagrams are really caused by wrong character recognition. Although some of the documents with the highest errors were explicitly marked to contain scanned text, it is natural to assume that the total number of such documents in the corpus is very small. Ambiguous error types might explain some of the errors found in Figure 6; see the discussion below. As a matter of fact, the number of OCR errors will grow when analyzing corpora with many OCRed pages.
 316 e-transformation and -transformation. Figures 7 and 8 show some interesting differ-ences between the use of both transformations in German Web pages. In the primary
German corpus, e-transformation errors are concentrated in a small class of documents (documents with rank &gt; 480) where we have a nontrivial number of occurrences, lead-smaller (0 . 19). Still, there are more documents containing an -transformation error.
This indicates that e-transformation is applied more systematically. The small plateau in Figure 7 is generated by some portion of text that was found in several documents.
The error rates that arise when applying e-transformation in a completely systematic way are typically larger. In the corpus we found some documents of this kind; since the rates are too high, these documents are not depicted in the figure.
 glish general HTML corpus. These errors, which mutate German words, only occur in a small number of English documents. Whereas German writers strongly prefer the e-transformation in situations where the correct characters are not available, we find a clear preference for the -transformation in the English documents. s-Transformation. Figure 9 shows the distribution of error rates for s-transformation in the primary German general HTML corpus. Since the corpus contains some Swiss documents, where  X  X  X  is categorically written  X  X s X  (cf. Section 4.4), the high mean (0 . 76) has to be relativized.

Overview. Table 20 summarizes the error rates of all types of errors in the general HTML type.
 318 6.3 Summary So Far
For both languages, the large majority of all documents has a small number of ortho-number of unacceptable documents with high error rates is found. Mean values for error rates are strongly influenced by the latter documents; the average error rate for the Best 80% class is usually much lower. The latter rate should also be considered when comparing results obtained for two corpora.

German: Results obtained for the primary and the secondary English general HTML corpus are almost identical. Differences between the two German corpora may partially be explained by names occurring in texts and by special character encoding problems.
Table 20 illustrates this effect, showing the mean error rates for all error types in the primary and secondary HTML corpora.
 e-transformation and s-transformation represent another typical error source. Whereas the number of spelling errors is significant, OCR errors do not play an essential role. all corresponding curves for other error types and other corpora (see also Figures 14 and 15); although the absolute numbers for error rates and details are of course distinct.
The close similarity of all distribution curves is striking and gives some evidence to the assumption that relevant features of the error rate distribution are stable, regardless of the corpora that are investigated. 7. Differences for Special Corpora
We summarize the error rates that we found in PDF corpora and in corpora for special thematic fields. In Figures 14 and 15, we present a small selection of distribution curves for error rates. Similarities of the distribution curves mentioned in the previous section should also be noted. 7.1 Distribution of Orthographic Errors in the General PDF Corpora
PDF and (primary) HTML corpus for English. The results show that PDF documents in general have a better quality than HTML documents. Whereas we have a mean error rate of 2 . 47 for orthographic errors in the HTML documents, the corresponding mean is only 1 . 38 for PDF. For the Best 80% documents the means are 0.67 (HTML) and 0.38 (PDF).
 German corpora. However, special effects polluted the picture. As we mentioned in
Section 2.1, the conversion of the German PDF documents to ASCII is very error prone. Although we excluded all converted documents that were obviously garbled by the conversion, we also found in the remaining documents examples of errors that
PDF documents are probably smaller. Mean error rates are 2.15 (HTML) versus 2.04 for OCR errors, 0.62 versus 0.07 for e-transformation errors, and 0.19 versus 0.16 for -transformation errors. Since the conversion tool categorically replaces letter  X  X  X  by  X  X s X , a very high number of s-transformation errors led to the effect that the overall mean error rate for the German PDF (3.95) is even larger than the rate for the German
HTML (3.86). 7.2 Distribution of Orthographic Errors in Distinct Thematic Corpora
Figure 11 describes the average error rates for orthographic errors and spelling errors in the English corpora. In almost all thematic areas, mean error rates are larger than the corresponding means in the general corpora; the differences are significant and the English Neurology corpus is very clean and represents an exception. For the Fish corpus, even the mean error rate for the Best 80% subclass is 2.72. We conjecture that corpora that are collected without a special thematic focus often contain a large number of  X  X rofessional X  and carefully edited Web pages. Web pages for special thematic areas 320 are perhaps less  X  X ublicity oriented. X  Furthermore, as a rule of thumb, documents in documents in scientific fields (Holocaust, Neurology). Corpora with a focus on history seem to occupy a middle position.
 presented in Table 21; numbers in brackets refer to the Best 80% subclass. The second column shows that, by and large, the ranking order for thematic areas induced by mean
German corpus Neurology, with its high error rate, does not follow this line. The high means for the Best 80% subclasses in the German corpora are remarkable and show that the low quality is not caused by a small number of bad documents. 7.3 Differences between the Two Crawling Strategies

 large number of documents with error rate 0. This special effect is caused by the large number of short documents that are obtained. For example, the mean length of all the documents with error rate 0 in the corpus Fish E (2) is 322 (number of lowercase normal tokens), whereas the average length of the documents in the corpus Fish E (1) is 14,196 (cf. Table 2).

Neurology, again comparing the simple and the refined strategies. 7.4 Summary So Far
PDF corpora were found to have lower error rates. Corpora covering pages from non-scientific thematic areas often have higher error rates than corpora crawled without a fixed thematic focus. Error rates in the corpora are influenced by the crawling strategy.
For English texts, refined crawling strategies that collect pages with a strong thematic focus seem to produce better corpora. 8. Error Rates and Document Genre Classifying Web documents by genre (Kessler, Nunberg, and Sch  X  utze 1997; Finn and
Kushmerick 2003; Dimitrova et al. 2003) represents one possible way to improve Web search techniques. Web-based corpus linguistics may benefit from these techniques the error rates observed in a document and its genre. After manual inspection of 322 hundreds of Web pages, we decided to use the following set of document genres for our investigations:
Even with this small number of classes, separation issues were sometimes difficult to address. We did not introduce finer subclasses since we expected that the number of ambiguous and problematic cases would be multiplied.
 at the primary general English HTML corpus and on the English corpora for the domains Fish, Mushrooms, and Neurology. For each of the latter three domains, both the corpus obtained with the simple crawling strategy and the corpus retrieved with the refined crawl were taken into account. Hence, a total of 7 corpora were investigated. 8.1 Genre Distribution of the Four Quality Classes
For each corpus, all documents in the classes Worst and Bad were manually classi-

English general HTML corpus. Not surprisingly, classes Chat and Junk dominate at the bad end of the quality spectrum, whereas class Prof dominates for good doc-uments. The same tendency was found for all corpora, although the percentage of
Prof documents in distinct quality classes was often larger. To add one further typical example, Table 25 presents the result for the corpus Fish E (1) retrieved with the simple type Prof. 324 326 8.2 Genre Distribution: Simple Crawl versus Refined Crawl tween the thematic corpora retrieved with the simple and the refined crawling strategy: differences are significant. At the same time, corpora retrieved with the refined strategy contain more documents of type Prof. We conjecture that the open compounds that were used in the queries for the refined crawl (cf. Section 2.2) represent a kind of  X  X igh-level language expressions X  that are typically used in a professional or scientific context.
With the above background, it is not surprising that the refined crawling strategy leads to better error rates. 8.3 Error Rates for Genres
Table 27 presents estimates for the mean error rates obtained for the distinct document genres in the seven corpora. These numbers represent estimates since not all documents of the classes Good and Best were classified. In all corpora, the mean error rate for class Prof is better than the rate for class Priv, which is better than the rate for class Chat.
The results indicate that the error rate of a document might be an interesting feature for genre classification: High error rates typically point to documents of the genres Junk and Chat; excellent error rates typically point to documents of type Prof. Results for the Neurology corpora indicate that  X  X cientific Chat/Junk X  may come with low error rates. 8.4 Summary So Far
An obvious correlation exists between the genre of a document and its error rate. Error rates might be used as one feature for genre classification. The analysis of genres helps one to understand the differences between corpora retrieved with distinct crawling strategies and the error rates observed in the corpora. 9. Filtering Methods typically contain a non-negligible number of documents with an unacceptable number of orthographic errors. We now turn to the question of how to use error dictionaries for recognizing and filtering Web pages with a high percentage of errors, thus excluding them from the corpus construction process. The question of what should be considered as a  X  X igh percentage X  has to be answered for each application. Generally speaking we would like to exclude at least those documents that are found at the right end of the diagrams presented in the previous sections.
 Definition some applications, small error dictionaries, which occupy less space and are easier to handle, may be advantageous. The results presented below show that when one
With an obvious interpolation, this observation supports the assumption that the 328 incompleteness of our maximal error dictionaries does not seriously reduce their fil-tering capacities. 9.1 Distribution of Error Frequencies
Zipf-like 7 distribution. Since a relatively small number of erroneous tokens already covers a substantial number of all error occurrences, it should not be surprising that even small error dictionaries help to identify pages with many errors. In Figure 12, we show the logarithmic frequencies of errors in a 1.4-terabyte subcorpus retrieved from the
Web in 1999 ( X  X eb-in-a-box X ). The upper diagram shows the distribution of all errors from the maximal English error dictionary, D err ( English,all ), in English Web pages. Only errors with at least two occurrences are covered. Similarly the lower diagram shows the distribution of errors from D err ( German,all ) in German Web pages. 9.2 Basic Filter Scenario
Suppose we are given a collection of Web pages, C . We may fix a user-defined threshold  X  in terms of the average number of errors per 1,000 tokens that we are willing to accept in a document to be added to our corpus. A document where the average number of errors per 1,000 tokens does not exceed  X  is called acceptable , other documents are called unacceptable . In practice, since we cannot count real errors, a token is considered erroneous if and only if it occurs in one of our error dictionaries. In Section 5, we have seen that the number of entries of the error dictionary found in a text yields a lower approximation for the real number of errors.
 vant documents that we would like to retrieve for  X  X uery X  we define the answer set of a filter F w. r. t . C as the set of all documents in passed by F . With these notions we may now define the parameters X  precision and recall.
 Definition
German general HTML corpora, which are denoted C E and C G three user-defined thresholds:  X  = 10,  X  = 5, and  X  = 1. The first bound is meant to exclude a small number of documents with an extraordinary number of orthographic errors. The second bound is more ambitious. The third bound might be used in situations where high accuracy is needed and we want to retrieve only documents with a negligible number of orthographic errors. 9.3 Automated Filter Construction We define a hierarchy of filters
Filters F k with higher index k generally lead to better results. On the negative side, they are more complex in terms of the number of entries of D k we generally assume that a user-defined threshold  X  has been fixed. For simplicity, we refer to the construction of filters for the English corpus, used, mutatis mutandis, for C G . All filters are computed automatically on the basis of training data. For training, two inputs were used. 1. Ranked error list. We computed a list of all entries of the maximal English 2. 2. Training corpus. The corpus C E was randomly split into a training Definition of Filters. The error dictionary D k for filter initial segment S of the ranked error list such that each unacceptable document in the training corpus contains at least k distinct entries of the segment S .Thethreshold  X  was defined as the minimal average number of occurrences of entries of D tokens in an unacceptable document of the training corpus. These entries need not be distinct.
 corpus. The philosophy behind this selection of a threshold is simple: We do not want to add any unacceptable document to the corpus to be built. Precision is much more important than recall, as long as a substantial number of documents is retrieved. As a matter of fact, we cannot expect a 100% precision on the test corpus. However, our results show that the loss of precision is not significant. 9.4 Filtering Results for English General HTML Corpus
In what follows we consider the three user-defined thresholds
For each of the filters F 1 = ( D 1 ,  X  1 ), ... , F 5 = ( D 330 = 10 (top),  X  = 5 (middle), and  X  = 1 (bottom). = 10 = 5 = 1 the size of the filter dictionary D k (second column), the filter threshold  X  corpora (columns 4, 5, 6, 7).

Baselines. When treating the complete test corpus as a  X  X aive X  answer set (recall 100%), we obtain 1. for  X  = 10, a precision of 94 . 76%, corresponding to 380 acceptable and 21 2. for  X  = 5, a precision of 87 . 28%, corresponding to 350 acceptable and 51 3. for  X  = 1, a precision of 57 . 10%, corresponding to 229 acceptable and 172
F 3 represents a good compromise between size and quality. Precision is almost optimal.
The answer set for the filter contains only one unacceptable document with an error rate of 13.24, which is very close to the threshold.
 inspection of the nine unacceptable documents in the answer set of the filter shows that they come very close to the bound  X  = 5. Note that error dictionaries D are larger than the corresponding dictionaries for the threshold k = 10 due to the larger number of unacceptable documents in the training corpus.
 are six unacceptable documents in the answer set, all with an error rate below 2. The numbers in Table 28 show how a more rigid (smaller) filter threshold compensates for the reduced size of error dictionaries essentially without sacrificing precision and with a modest loss of recall. To illustrate the effect of filtering, yet from another perspective, Figure 13 presents the distribution of error rates (number of entries from the maximal
English error dictionary D err ( English,all ) per 1,000 tokens) in the answer set and in the set of documents rejected by the filter F 3 constructed for the user-defined threshold 5. The filter was evaluated on the test subcorpus. The figure shows that almost all docu-ments passed (rejected) by the filter have an error frequency below (beyond) 5 errors per 1,000 tokens. 9.5 Filtering Results for the German General HTML Corpus For computing the ranked error list, a list with the frequencies of 18, 624, 436 tokens in German Web pages was used. Via intersection with the list of all entries of the maximal
German error dictionary, D err ( German,all ), we obtained a ranked error list with 454, 709 entries. The training and test corpora contain 314 and 308 documents, respectively, from we only point to some differences. Frequencies decrease more rapidly in the German ranked error list, as may be seen in Figure 12. In the German list, the top-ranked part is dominated by e/ -transformation errors and errors where the letter  X  is replaced by ss .
The 10 top-ranked entries and their frequencies are shown in Table 29. This special class of frequent errors leads to small filter dictionaries. For example, the filter dictionary for  X  = 10, k = 5 has 16,277 entries, and the dictionary for  X  = 5, k = 5 has 127,023 entries.
On the other hand, the recall values achieved with the dictionaries in general are lower than in the English case. 10. Example Applications
Obviously, the methods described above are very useful for all corpus tools that visually present linguistic data from Web pages (words, n-grams, concordances, phrases, sen-tences, aligned bilingual material, etc.) to the user. Filters help to exclude inappropriate pages. In the remaining data, tokens that represent entries of the error dictionaries can be marked. Depending on the application, the system may then decide to suppress this material or to add a warning when presenting it. In the remainder of this section, two case studies are presented that demonstrate the usefulness of filtering techniques and error dictionaries in distinct applications. 10.1 Text Correction with Crawled Dictionaries
It has often been observed that fixed handcrafted dictionaries only have a modest coverage when applied to new texts and corpora. 9 Still, for various text processing tasks, dictionaries with high coverage are needed. The generation of crawled dictionaries that collect the vocabulary of appropriate Web pages is one way to obtain a better coverage.
As a matter of fact, the quality of these dictionaries suffers from orthographic errors in the analyzed pages. Using the above filters helps to reduce the number of errors that are 332 imported. In order to further improve a crawled dictionary, we may either eliminate all words that represent entries of the error dictionaries, or we may mark these words for a manual inspection. In what follows we report on an experiment in the area of lexical text correction where these techniques improved: 1. the quality of crawled dictionaries by avoiding erroneous entries, 2. the accuracy of lexical text correction achieved with these dictionaries,
Correction Strategy. Ignoring details, we used the following correction strategy each token 11 of the input text, the most similar words are retrieved from the dictionary as a set of correction candidates. In many cases the token will be found in the dictionary and represents a correction candidate with optimal similarity. Based on (1) the similarity candidate in a corpus, each candidate receives a score. If the score of the best candidate exceeds a given threshold  X  , the token is replaced by this candidate. In the other case, the token is left unmodified. A good balance between similarity and frequency information in the score is obtained via training. The threshold, which is also optimized via training, guarantees that the input token is only replaced if additional confidence is available that the best correction candidate in fact represents the corrected version of the token. In the experiment described below, the system was trained on a corpus for the domain
Mushrooms. The evaluation corpus is from the domain Fish. Hence, the two corpora are disjoint and cover distinct thematic areas. More details on the correction system can be found in Strohmaier et al. (2003b).

Garbled Input Text for Correction. We collected 10 texts from the domain Fish, all containing a nontrivial number of errors. Texts were retrieved from the Web, using queries to Google with spelling errors, such as fish anglers infomation realy . We checked that the texts do not contain paragraphs that are also found in the documents of the corpora Fish E introduced in Section 2.2. The concatenation of the 10 texts was used as input to the text correction system. For the evaluation, a corrected version of the full text was manually created. The full text contains 17,697 tokens of which 418 (2 . 36%) were found to be erroneous.
 Background Dictionaries for Correction. As a baseline, a first crawled dictionary

 coverage and accuracy results would probably be possible.

Evaluation Results. We then compared the lexical coverage (percentage of tokens of the correct version of the input text found in the dictionary) and correction accuracy (percentage of correct tokens after automated correction) for each of the three dictio-naries. The results are presented in Table 30. The accuracy of the input text is 97 . 64%. The fifth column gives the improvement in accuracy, taking the input text as a baseline.
The last column mentions the number of erroneous tokens in the text that are found in the respective error dictionary.
 dictionaries in the correction dictionary leads to an additional gain.

Overproduction and Underproduction of the Error Dictionary. As mentioned above, 418 tokens of the input text represented proper errors. From these, 254 (60.77%) turned out to be entries of the maximal English error dictionary D this value for underproduction is very compatible with our estimates in Section 5. dictionary.

Analyzing the Effect of Using Filters and Error Dictionaries. The most important error source in the correction process are erroneous tokens of the text that X  X y accident X  represent entries of the crawled dictionaries. Using the above strategy, these false friends are only replaced by another word w of the correction dictionary if overwhelm-ing frequency information is available that leads to a preference of w after computing the balanced score for similarity and frequency. The dictionary D 418 erroneous tokens of the text. The dictionary D + F crawl of filtered pages, contains only 92 erroneous tokens. After eliminating all entries of the maximal error dictionary, the new dictionary D + F + ED very interesting additional number is the following: when eliminating in D 334 erroneous tokens of the text. This shows that the filtering step eliminates 56 (= 105 erroneous tokens of the text that are not found in the error dictionary and proves that a two-step procedure X  X irst using filters for crawling pages, then eliminating entries of error dictionaries afterwards X  X eads to optimal results. 10.2 Generating Translation Data from Parallel Corpora dictionaries. Since only a small number of large parallel corpora are available, which are moreover specialized both with respect to form and contents, the Web represents an important archive for mining parallel texts (Resnik and Smith 2003). When building up bilingual dictionaries for machine translation, or when presenting parallel phrases dictionaries help to reduce errors in parallel corpora. Our methods can be applied to any kind of parallel corpus. For our experiments we used the freely available Europarl corpus. 13 The corpus covers the proceedings of the European Parliament 1996 X 2001 in 11 official languages of the European Union. We only analyzed the English and German versions of the parallel texts. The 488 documents in the corpus are of an excellent quality.
Our goal was to find English and German texts with a nontrivial number of errors (if any) and to detect these errors. Since the overproduction of error dictionaries in very accurate texts is high, the problem is challenging. The maximal error dictionaries for the two languages were used to determine the error rate of each document. Table 31 shows the twenty documents with the highest error rates for both the English and the
German subcollection of the corpora. Columns 4 and 5 describe the number of tokens that represent entries of the respective error dictionary and the number of real errors among these hits. The results show that when analyzing very accurate texts, the error rate is not always a safe indicator for a corresponding number of real errors. Still, the experiment isolates 246 real errors, only looking at 40 documents. When collecting translation correspondences, we may simply discard all phrases/sentences with a hit in an error dictionary, together with their aligned counterparts. Many translation pairs with errors will be avoided. Given the length of the documents, the number of hits of the error dictionaries is small, hence the loss of recall is not essential. In this way our methods may help to improve the generation of translation data even from collections of very accurate parallel texts. 11. Conclusion
In this article we investigated the distribution of orthographic errors of distinct types in the English and German Web. Experiments based on a variety of very large error dic-tionaries showed that Web corpora typically contain a non-negligible number of pages 336 with an unacceptable number of orthographic errors. Typing errors represent the most important subclass. In German Web pages, errors resulting from character encoding problems represent another important category. In our experiments, PDF documents were found to contain less orthographic errors than HTML documents, and corpora covering specific thematic areas were found to contain more errors than collections of  X  X eneral X  pages without such a focus. Some differences were remarkable; in particular, our corpora for special thematic areas related to hobbies contain many pages with a high number of orthographic errors. We also found that mean error rates are influenced by the collection strategy. Specific crawling strategies help to avoid chat and junk while attracting professional documents. Since document genre and error rates are correlated, refined crawling strategies may help to reduce mean error rates.
 help to detect and eliminate pages with many orthographic errors. Filters with user-defined thresholds work well for both languages. Obviously, the possibility of deleting pages with many orthographic errors and of marking all entries of error dictionaries in the remaining documents opens a wide range of interesting applications in distinct areas of corpus linguistics. To exemplify possible applications we showed how to im-prove the quality of Web-crawled dictionaries for text correction. With these filtered dic-tionaries, higher values for correction accuracy were obtained than with those directly obtained from Web crawls. In a second experiment, we showed how error dictionar-ies may be used to improve the automated collection of translation correspondences, avoiding translation pairs with orthographic errors.

Web search engines where the error rate of a given document is used as one parameter in the ranking of answers. In many search scenarios, answer documents with a large number of orthographic errors appear to be less reliable, and the user might wish to concentrate on  X  X rofessional X  or carefully edited Web pages.
 corpora is difficult for many reasons. For example, it is not clear how to treat pages with artificial vocabulary that is only introduced to obtain a better ranking. We learned that often these junk lists are intensionally enriched with many orthographic errors to obtain a better ranking, in particular for erroneous queries. In our experiments, some when inspecting documents for genre classification, other less eye-catching examples were found. Some portions of text occurred in several documents. The conversion of conversion of German PDF documents to ASCII turned out to be very error prone.
Nonstandard vocabulary (special names, foreign language expressions, archaic lan-guage, programming code, slang, etc.) is another source that makes various pages inappropriate for corpus construction.
 foreign language expressions, archaic language, programming code, and slang. Special dictionaries for these expressions would not only help to detect and exclude pages with a high amount of nonstandard vocabulary, but they could also be used as additional filters in the construction of error dictionaries. The results in Section 5.2 indicate that the overproduction of our error dictionaries could be reduced in a significant way by eliminating entries that represent expressions of the earlier-mentioned type. As a matter of fact, new types of spelling errors were found during the experiments described earlier. It might be interesting to enlarge the error dictionaries for spelling errors, taking the new patterns into account. contrast to our first intuitions, the number of ambiguities arising from this correction
More details on text correction with error dictionaries will be given in a forthcoming paper.
