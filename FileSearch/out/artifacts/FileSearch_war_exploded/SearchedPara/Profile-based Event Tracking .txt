 In this res earch, we focus on tracking topics that originate and evolve from a specific event. Intuitively , a few key elem ents of a target event, such as date, loca tion, and persons involved, would be enough for making a decision on whether a test story is on-topic. Consequently , a profile-b ased event tracking method is proposed. We attempt to build an event profile from the given on-topic stories by robust inform ation retrieval technologies. A feature selection m etric and a recognized event clause are utilized to determ ine m ost (if not all) key sem antic elem ents of the target event. P relim inary experim ents on the TDT2 mandarin corpus show that this profile -based event tracking method is promising. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Information Filtering. Algorithms. Topic Detection and Tracking, Topic Tracking, Event Tracking. As one of the five research task s established by Topic Detection and Tracking evaluations [1] , topic tracking aims at detecting stories on a target topic in tempor ally ordered news streams. In TDT, topics are at different levels of granularity [2] . Some topics concentrate on a s pecific event, while others cons ist of a s eries of related events as an activity . Obviously , topics with different kernels, i.e. events or activities, should be tackled by different strategies. In this work, we focus on tracking topics with a specific event as the kernel. W e anticipate building a sy stem with full capacity bas ed on a s ucces sful event tracking s trategy , as event is the base component of a topic whether its kernel is an event or an activity . The tracking sy stem is usually provided with a small number of on-topic stories (ty pically from one to four), and is then expected to detect all other stories on that topic in the streaming of news. In our study , we use one on-topic stor y for training, as required in recent TDT evaluations [3] . Intuitively , an event, like  X  X arthquake in Afghanistan on May 30, 1998 X , could be captured by a few semantic elements, such as date, location, persons or organizations involved. And the following stories on the sam e topic m ay refer to it just with a few elements, like  X  X fghanistan X  and  X  X arthquake X . If a sy stem holds the event elem ents at hand, the tracking tas k would becom e eas y and effective. S ystem  X  X  decis ion would be simply based on how many event elem ents appear in the tes t s tory . F rom this observation, we propose a profile-based event tracking method and explore how to automatically construct an event profile from a given on-topic story . Because inform ation extraction technology is not m ature enough to support open domain applications, we attempt to apply robust information retrieval technologies to construct event profiles that are approxim ate to the im agined ideal fram e-like ones . In our method, the imagined frame -like profile is serialized into a s et of Boolean expres sions , each of which cons ists of two or more event elem ents and takes effect independently . The serialization not only facilitates com putation, but also avoids tackling the difficult problem of as sociating a word/phras e with an appropriate sem antic role/slo t. The procedure of constructing an event profile from a given on-topic story is as follows: Step 1. Obtaining key event elem ents : 1.1 Using a feature selection m etric to get the top N f 1.2 Determ ining the m ost im portant event clause C 1.3 Us ing the im portant event claus e C e to filter the top N 1.4 Clustering the features left into different groups; Step 2. Constructing profile ba sed on the key event elem ents ; Step 3. Verify ing the generated profiles on the historical data; Generally speaking, the s emantic elem ents of an event tend to appear within a short distance ra ther than spread around in the whole s tory . Therefore, in tracking, we regard two adjacent claus es as a unit to m atch each expres sion in the event profile. If an expression is m atched, the te st story will be labeled as on-topic. And a decision value based on the value of the matched Boolean expression is assigned. If there is no expression matched, the decision value will be com puted based on how many event elem ents appear in the local text. above in the profile construction algorithm. With the intuition that event el ements should have enough power to distinguish on-topic stories from others and cohesively describe the event itself, we attem pt to locate the event features from two directions. Firstly , a feature selection m etric like inform ation gain is utilized to determine features with str ong distinguishing power. Candidate features include: nam ed entities such as location, date, person or organization X  X  name; noun words; verb words except modal ones, copula, and some others; Chinese character within noun and verb words. To deal with the problem of extremely unbalanced data in calculating the selection metric s, we randomly choose off-topic stories about M times the on-topic ones. And we take average of N pass randomizations as the final value for each feature to avoid unstable performance. In the meantime, we split a story into a set of clauses, each of which is regarded as an independent sample. By this kind of expansion, we simply use Boolean indicators for each feature in calculating the selection metrics. important event clause C e , which is determined by a robust sentence extraction method. An im portance score is assigned to each clause in the given on-topic story, and the clause with the highest score is selected. We set up criteria of measuring clause significance for describing a target event as follows: (1) Sim -cosine similarity between the clause and the whole (2) Wd -indicates whether the clause contains a concrete date (3) Wl -indicates whether the clause contains a location that is (4) Wpo -indicates whether the clause contains a person or Then each clause score is computed as the product of the above four factors as CS = Sim*Wd*Wl*Wpo . Why we choose the most important event clause for filtering? In the task definition of TDT, a story is defined as  X  X  topically cohesive segment of news that includes two or more declarative independent clauses about a single event X  [1]. So, an event should be stated in at least one declarative independent clause. It is expected that most, if not all, event specific keywords would appear in some one clause. Finally, the features recognized by the two-pass filtering are simply clustered into different groups. Named entities are grouped according to their categories (Location, Date, Person or Organization). Other features (noun, verb) will be combined to form a new element if they have a common Chinese character. When the key elements of a target event are determined, a human-readable profile will be constructed according to the following heuristic rules: 1. named entities (LOCATION, DATE, PERSON or 2. words in a group are concatenated as an item by OR operator, 3. a Boolean expression consists of the entity item if any, all 4. if there are more than one noun items, the first Boolean 5. each Boolean expression is also assigned a confidence value To refine the generated event profiles, verification need to be done on the historical data. We c ount the number of true and false positive samples for each profile expression. The ratio  X  of the number of false positive samples to that of true positive samples is used as evaluation metric at present. Profile expression with  X  larger than a threshold TH will be disabled. We test the profile-based tracking method (PBT) on the TDT2 Mandarin Corpus. Seven (with topic ID 07, 20, 48, 70, 85, 89, 91) out of the twenty topics annotated in the corpus, are chosen. They all take a specific event as the kernel. Minimal topic-weighted normalized detection cost is used for measuring performance. We use a one-sided information gain measure as the feature selection metric. Other parameters are set as follows: M =10, N =10, P =10, TH =3.0. Table 1 shows the results. Figures are the average of three different runs. We take a simple yet effective centroid based tracking method CBT (TFIDF weighting + Cosine similarity) as a baseline. It achieves the lowest tracking cost 0.0656 with a threshold 0.1192 on the chosen topics, where our PBT method reaches its best performance 0.0390 when N f =25. Without filtering features by the event clause, PBT-NF behaves awfully poor and erratic. In this paper, we propose a profile-based method for tracking topics with a specific event as the kernel. Technologies from IE, machine learning, and IR, are combined to build an approximate event profile. Preliminary experiments on the TDT2 mandarin corpus show that this profile-b ased tracking method is promising for topics centered on a specific event, as the optimal normalized detection cost drops from 0.0656 to 0.0390. With the proposed method, human intervention becomes possible and the tracking system could absorb new and pr ecise knowledge in due course. We expect that the profile-based event tracking method will benefit from more natural la nguage processing technologies.
