 Spatial trajectory data is widely available today. Over a sustained period of time, trajectory data has been collected from numerous GPS devices, smartphones, sensors and social media applications. Daily increases of real-time trajectory data have also been phenom-enal in recent years. More and more new applications have emerged to derive business values from both trajectory data warehouses and real-time trajectory data. Due to their very large volumes, their na-ture of streaming, their highly variable levels of data quality, as well as many possible links with other types of data, making sense of spatial trajectory data becomes one of the crucial areas for big data analytics. In this paper we will present a review of the extensive work in spatiotemporal data management and trajectory mining, and discuss new challenges and new opportunities in the context of new applications, focusing on recent advances in trajectory data management and trajectory mining from their foundations to high performance processing with modern computing infrastructure.

A spatial trajectory is the trace of an object moving in a geo-graphical space, typically represented by a sequence of locations with timestamps[20]. One common type of trajectory data is record-ings from GPS-equipped vehicles. There are many other types of trajectory data, collected from smart phones, user check-ins and geo-tagged messages and photos in social networking applications. Trajectory data can also be collected without user X  X  active participa-tion, through, for example, mobile phone cell tower IDs, WiFi con-nections, the use of public transport cards and many location-based services. Trajectory data can also be derived from RFID readers, video cameras and remote sensing data.
 adapting similarity measures from computational geometry, time series and string processing with or without added temporal con-siderations. In recent years, trajectory data mining and predication have received extensive attention from both academia and industry. Some representative work include co X  X raveller pattern mining[9, 12], trajectory clustering[11], and discovery of frequent travel pat-terns, popular routes and significant locations and events[8, 4, 19, 14].

The focus of trajectory data management and mining has now been changed to addressing the problem of deriving values from trajectory data in a holistic approach. We need to deal with not only very large volume of historical trajectory data but also for stream-ing location data in the context of rich links with other types of information such as business data, social media data and environ-ment data. It is the time to revisit every step in trajectory data management and mining, from data capturing, cleaning, calibra-tion, compression, storage, management to query processing and knowledge discovery. The hierarchical nature of trajectory data has to be considered systematically[10], so different levels of rep-resentation from raw trajectories, calibrated data to semantic anno-tations that serve different purposes can be managed and queried in one database. Extensive and sometimes on-demand links from trajectory data to other type of information based on the ubiqui-tous attributes of location and time of trajectory data hold the key to making values of trajectory data. They should also be supported for extracting, maintaining and using such links. Modern appli-cation can also have an extremely high level of concurrency, for example, with tens of thousands of concurrent shortest path queries using real-time traffic information for smart phone users. That de-mands a rethinking of the ways to index and process trajectory data to support data and query caching and parallel processing. To make commercial use of trajectory data, benchmarking, data archiving, privacy and crowd sousing also need to be addressed. How to make effective use of modern computing infrastructure, such as column stores, NoSQL databases and distributed file systems, in-memory databases and large computer clusters, also needs urgent attention[18].

Trajectory data becomes a fundamental type of data with unlim-ited potentials. We need to develop a general-purpose and scalable trajectory data management system to manage. It is necessary to combine effort from different and previously often disconnected communities, including geographical information systems, intelli-gent transport systems, database management and data mining, to work with the industry to address real problems and to derive val-ues.
