 All domains of human activity a nd society require creativity. This dissertation applies mach ine learning and data mining techniques to create a framework for applying emerging Human Centric Computing (HCC) systems for study and creation of creativity support tools. The proposed system collects and analyzes high-resolution on-line and physically captured contextual and social data to s ubstantially contribute to new and better understandings of workplace be havior, social and affective experience, and creative activities. Using this high granularity data, dynamic instruments that use real-time sensing and inference algorithms to provide guidance and support on events and processes related to affect and creativity will be developed and evaluated. In the long term, it is expected that this approach will lead to adaptive reflectiv e technologies that stimulate collaborative activity, reduce time pressure and interruption, mitigate detrimental effects of negative affect, and increase individual and team creative activity and outcomes.

The proposed dissertation aspires to significan tly contribute to two of the Computing Research Association X  X  five Grand Research Challenges in Information Syst ems and Computer Science and Engineering. First, it will contribute to helping people  X  X uild a Team of Their Own through cognitive partnerships of human beings with software agents and robots to enhance individual productivity, effectiveness, [and creativity]. X  Second, it will contribute to  X  X roviding a Teacher for Every Learner through interfaces that present individually tailored, learner-centered guidance and feedback that enable people to more fully realize their creative potential. X  One methodology to provide impetus to creativity lies in leveraging the relation between affect and creativity. While the relation between creativity and affect is well established, the lack of suitable methodologies to measur e affect has limited the use of models of affect-creativity re lation towards development of creativity support tools. This re search applies machine learning and data mining techniques to create a framework for using emerging Human Centric Computi ng (HCC) systems. Research indicates that emotional events in the daily lives of organizational workers and their corresponding creative output are closely interlinked. For example, Amabile [2] showed that positive emotional experiences may precede, proceed, or be concomitant with the creative event. The key question is whether this interrelationship can be used to design creativity support tools in IT environments. This project focuses on basic and applied research, on creative teamwork in organizations and individually tailored interfaces to support creativity. Amabile X  X  research has found that organizational creativity is significantly mediated by positive and negative affect [2]. The importance of affective interaction in individual and group interaction has also been highlighted by Sutton X  X  research on team dynamics [7]. Norman has stated that understanding human emotion is one of the greatest challenges of our time [4] and Picard has outlined the benefits of advancing affective computing [6]. Sensing of behavior and human dynamics in everyday and organizational contexts [5] and online activity [6] provides essential insi ghts into creative processes and elucidates opportunities for intervention. This research has two primary objectives. It will (1) advance hybrid methodologies that pr ovide new findings at finer granularity focused on individual and team creative processes; (2) develop and evaluate new types of interventions and interfaces that incorporate affect, context, and social interaction to leverage opportunities to promote creativity. This research will develop hybr id methodologies that combine strengths from the social sciences and their emerging methods for studying creativity and organizational behavior [1, 2] with advanced computational approaches to sensing human behavior in physical and digital environments [3, 5]. This research will investigate the extent to which the existing methodologies from the social sciences and the computational technologies can enhance each other X  X  findings and can be advanced toward a new hybrid methodology that preserves existing strengths and leverages the combination to make new and deeper findings. This approach will use as a foundation the most widely accepted methods of consensually assessi ng creative product and processes (e.g., the Consensual Assessment Method) [1] and the methods used in the most advanced study of creativity in high-tech research organizations (e.g., the TEAM assessment protocols) [2]. The strengths of these methods will be combined with context-aware systems that make use of physiological sensing, wearable computing, and ambient interfaces. Rich data generated from these advanced sensor systems will be incorporated into the development of the hybrid met hodologies. These applications will be capable of using multi-modal sensing to attend and respond to human emotion and social interaction in real time. These types of systems are already creating applications that apply psychological findings on cognition, emotion, and physiological and behavioral sensing to improve people X  X  problem-solving ability and understand and alter their motivation and experience [5, 6]. This re search will apply these hybrid methodologies to create more natural ways of seamlessly integrating these methods and sy stems to enhance both individual and organizational creative practice. Interventions will be advanced in the context of Creative Ubiquitous Environments (CUE s). CUEs have three primary functions. First, CUEs use sensors (video and audio, physiological, contextual, behavioral, wearable, etc.) that create real-time multi-modal sensing platforms [3] and socioscopes [5] that can accurately and continuously track all team members and interactions simultaneously at very fine behavioral scales. These technologies provide researchers, creative practitioners, and the systems  X  X hemselves X  the opportunity to observe, archive, and use machine learning to infer diverse elements of creative activity and process. Second, CUEs can provi de new tools to people, making a variety of creative tools and practices more accessible in both everyday physical environments and in a distributed and ubiquitous manner. Third, CUE systems have the ability to employ embedded theories of creativity and collaboration to provide interactive interventions that are individually tailored and coordinated with team activity. These interventions are aimed at enhancing and teaching creative processes and skills, and fostering innovation The long-range goal of this research is to develop and evaluate Creative Ubiquitous Environment (CUEs) tools through the integration of Pentland X  X  soci oscopes, Burleson X  X  real-time multimodal affective sensing tools, and Microsoft Research X  X  HCC technologies (MyLifeBits , EEG, etc.). The proposed research uses readily deployable Smart Badges and online survey tools to conduct studies invol ving small teams of 5 to 7 researchers who are engaged in a common activity that requires creativity. The teams wear Pentland X  X  Sociometers (Smart Badges) that track location and analyze elements of participants X  social interaction through bi-directional IR, accelerometers, and low-resolution microphone analys is. Simultaneously, Amabile X  X  TEAM Survey for the study of teams, leadership, affect, and creativity is deployed and the re sponses subsequently coded to obtain end-of-day self-report, peer-report, and consensual assessment of patterns of individual affect, leadership, productivity, and creativity. At a later stage, a small set of CUEs Interventions will be developed a nd deployed within these studies and will likewise be assessed through the same tools. This research aims to contribute to human computer interaction by creating and disseminating hybrid methodologies that present a finer granularity of multiple behavioral and affective elements for creativity research in IT research organizations. It is hoped that this finer data will make the concept of creativity and its pertaining phenomenon such as affect and intelligence more accessible to technology and practice and help in design of creativity support tools that will serve to catalyze innovative advances in the advancement of creativeIT and will have a broader impact on research in human creativity as well.
