 In recent years, we have seen the trends in the growing popularity of mobile device (e.g. mobile phone, PDAs, vehicle phone, and e-books). According to the report of International Telecommunication Union (ITU), mobile cellular sub-scriptions have reached an estimated 5.3 billion (over 70 percent of the world population) at the end of 2010. Intuitionally, mobile device is now playing an increasingly important role in human life. Moreover, it is becoming a special market potential. According to IAB 1 (Interactive Advertising Bureau), mobile advertising is accepted by a lot of consume rs, comparing to online advertising on World Wide Web due to its highly interactive with users, which is hard to achieve for other media. Mobile advertising is an alternative way of web monetization strategies, especially for t elecommunication corporatio ns to expand revenue. Fur-thermore, it is predicted that the average annual growth will rose by 72% in the next five year.

There are many ways of mobile communication, such as WAP, GPRS, 3G modem, and PHS. However, due to high charge of internet access, not all users have mobile internet access. Mobile broadband subscriptions are 1 billion (about 20 percent of the mobile subscriptions) 2 . In Taiwan, for example, the ratio of the mobile web users to the mobile users is less than 50%. Meanwhile, VAS (Value-Added Services) is deeply influenced by prices. There are about 75% customers, who will consid er prices rather than interest when choose VAS [9]. Therefore, the lower VAS prices and int ernet accessing charges the customers get, the more customers we find. Thus, a way to reduce the internet accessing fee mobile devices is important.

In this paper, we propose a framework for mobile advertising, which involves the telecommunication, the advertiser, and the subscriber. It is dubbed  X  X riple-win X  that all of them get benefits from each other. The telecommunication pro-vides the Ads Agent Platform to attract campaign for advertisers. The adver-tiser registers commercial ads with th e telecommunication , and pays a reason-able price. The users subscribe for promotional ads, which are sent to their mobile devices by the Ads Agent Platfor m in order to get discounted internet accessing from the telecommunication. W ithin this framework, the advertiser gets repay when the ads bring potential customers; the telecommunication gets benefit by increasing the number of internet subscribers; and the subscriber also gets coupons and discounted internet accessing. As a result, this framework is triple-win for the telecommunication, the advertiser and the subscriber.
However, delivering appropriate ads of the ideal time at the ideal place to the ideal subscriber are key issues. We con sider HWW (How, When and What), the three key issues that we really care about: (1) How do we show the ads in sub-scribers X  mobile phone? (2) When should we show the ads to ensure subscribers will read ads without redundancy? (3) What potential ads will be clicked by the subscribers?
In this paper, we describe our design for mobile advertising platform based on three aspects: context, content and user preference. The system makes utilization of velocity-detection and content-matc h to allocate personalized ads. In order to decrease redundant ads and to increase business value, mobile ad matching system should consider subscriber X  X  current status and activities before delivering personalized mobile ads. 2.1 Consumer Behavior and Personalized Advertising Marketing researchers have studied consumer behaviors for decades from ana-lyzing the factors of consumer behaviors and to model building. Turban et al. [7] analyzed the main factors on consumer X  X  decision, including consumer X  X  indi-vidual characteristics, the environment and the merchant X  X  marketing strategy (such as price and promotion). Varshney and Vetter [10] also proposed the use of demographics, location information, user preference, and store sales and spe-cials for mobile advertising and shopping application. Rao and Minakakis [5] also suggest that customer profiles, history, and needs are important for marketing. Xu et al. [9] proposed a user model based o n experimental cir cumstances studies of the restaurants, and used Baysian Network to analyze which variables would affect the attitude of consumers toward mobile advertising.

In summary, the most effective factors ca n be divided into three parts: Con-tent, Context and User Preference. Content factor includes brand, price, mar-keting strategy, etc. Context factor includes user location, weather, time, etc. At last, User Preference includes brand, interest, user activity, etc.. Online (Web) advertising is shown to be more effective than traditional media since it predicts user X  X  intent by the pages that the user visits. However, for mobile advertising, more contextual information and user pr eference can be obtained based on the location, speed of users X  mobile device. 2.2 Web Contextual Advertising In contextual advertising, an ad generally features a title, a text-based abstract, and a hyperlink. The title is usually depicted in bold or a colorful font. The latter of the abstract is generally clear and concise due to space limitations. The hyperlink links to an ad web page, known as the landing page.

Several studies pertaining to advertising research have stressed the impor-tance of relevant associations for consumers and how irrelevant ads can turn off users and relevant ads are more likely to be clicked [1], [2], [3]. Ribeiro-Neto et al [6]. proposed a number of strategies for matching pages to ads based on extracted keywords. To identify the important parts of the ad, the authors ex-plored the use of different ad sections (e.g., bid phrase, title and body) as a basis for the ad vector. The winning strategy required the bid phrase to appear on the page, and then ranked all such ads using the cosine of the union of all the ad sections and the page vectors. While both pages and ads are mapped to the same space, there exists a discrepancy (called  X  X mpedance mismatch X ) between the vocabulary used in the ads and on the pages. Hence, the authors improved matching precision by expanding the page vocabulary with terms from similar pages.

Besides, in contextual advertising, Fan et al. proposed the utilization of sen-timent detection for blogger-centric contextual advertising. The results clearly indicated that their proposed method can effectively identify those ads that are positively correlated with the given blogp ages [2], [3]. 2.3 Mobile Advertising Mobile advertising is predicted to w ill become an important telecommunica-tion X  X  revenue and monetization strategies. Advertisers can associate each user with fully personalized ads to increase large value of mobile ads. The existing mobile advertising methods can be divided into 3 categories including SMS, Ap-plets, and Browser. SMS typically cont ain one or more commercial offers or ads that invite users to subscribe or purchase products and services. Mobile ads em-bedded in applets are contextual ads that are set pop-up when users are using the applets. The browser is a particular a pplet for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resource on the World Wide Web. Mobile ads showed in browser are more similar contextual advertising on the web. Note, both applets and browsers require data transmission through the internet. This leads to ad-ditional payment of internet charges to users, while receiving SMS is free for users.

SMS is the most common mobile advertising for enterprises. However, due to infrastructure limitations, it does not support customized mobile ads per individual. Thus, many users treat these SMS as spam. As indicated by Giuffrida et al. in [4], even though the mobile advertising makes a substantial improvement in overall business performance by target ing users with most relevant offers based on user purchase histories, the hard lim it imposed by the carrier forces them to target clusters of consumers and send to all users in a cluster.

As mentioned earlier, mobile broadband adoption using 3G are about 20 per-cents of all mobile subscriptions worldwide due to high price. Thus, it seems promising to explore the mobile advertising market for telecom industry. In fact, the telecom industry has used SMS for mobile advertising since a long time ago. However, such advertising mechanism does not work well since users do not gain any benefit. On the other hand, web-based advertising provided by Google and Apple is more acceptable by users for t he reason of free applications. By providing discounted broadband subscriptions, users are more willing to read ad-vertisements. After all, the idea of pay ing broadband subscr iption fee to receive ads will not make users feel good, even for free applications. For example, VIBO Telecom Inc. in Taiwan, provides MobiBo n service for users to obtain bonus by reading online ads. However, the data transmission of MobiBon is paid by users. We believe that the proposed framework in this paper could solve the dilemma and increase the revenue for telecom industry. 3.1 Addresses the 3 Key Issues for Mobile Advertising SMS or Broadband Ads? There are 2 mechanisms for existing mobile ad-vertising: SMS and broadband advertisement. SMS is a common way of mobile advertising. It often contains textual ads to promote products and services. How-ever, the infrastructure limitation of SMS makes full customization infeasible [4]. On the other hand, broadband ads are not restricted by this limitation and can be supported by cloud computing technique.

For broadband advertising, the access p rices/fees of mobile broadband services will also affect the advertising mech anism. If the access fees are charged by packages, the style of the ads and the number of ads to be delivered can be limited. If, however, the subscribers have unlimited internet access, various style of ads can also be considered. Here, we consider a design o f ad allocator which can be applied for both situations via mobile broadband service. While delivering ads to subscribers, the potential ad alloca tor also records the time that user spent on ads, the number of mobile ads that are clicked/closed by the user in exchange for discounted mobile broadband access. This kind of design can work for either kinds of charging methods.

In addition, due to the limited size of smartphone screen and data transmission charge, we use the textual ads as the mobile ads to save the screen space. We show the mobile ads on the top of screen to get subscribers attention. If the subscribers are interested in the ads, h e/she can read the detail by clicking on the ads. The subscribers can also submit query to the mobile ad allocator for promotions and select products by themselves. In the meantime, the mobile ad allocator provides maps and the location information of the products. He/she can visit the nearby stores. We consider su ch activities to be more effective, since the subscriber is more likely to buy their favorite products.
 When to Show the Ads? Two timing often used in mobile advertising are trigger-based and fixed-schedule. The trigger-based timing refers to activities which happen after certain user events. For example, the mobile ads are sent to the user when the user sends or recei ves SMS in [4]. In our framework, the mobile ad allocator is designed with both fixed schedule as well as trigger-based advertising. To avoid redundant ads and to reduce the system loads, the mobile ad allocator does not match or show ads when the phone is on standby mode. When a smart phone is running on standard power mode, mobile ads are shown in an interval of 30 minutes. However, ads will also be triggered when the smart phones wake up from standby mode for five minutes or by submitted queries. Ads Allocation Factors. As mentioned earlier, mobile advertising has a wide variety of factors to be considered, including: context, content and user pref-erence. In our framework, we consider o ne context factor (locality) and three dimensions of content factor including product category and promotion activity as well as short-term interest represented by user query. These four factors and the mapping between the user and the content are used for personalized ads allocation.  X  Locality We consider the reachibility of ads based on user location and ve- X  Product Category The system categorizes ads can be classified into 5 cate- X  Promotion Price and discount are the most significant factor for customers X   X  User Query It reflects the factor for short-t erm requirement that is trigger-3.2 System Architecture As shown in figure 2, the Ad Agent Platform consists of three components: the mobile ad database, the user profile and the personalized ad matching. When the advertiser registers commercial mobile ads, we obtain the data for the mobile ad database. Similarly, we can attain subscriber X  X  information as user profile when they subscribe for the mobile advertising service and download the mobile ad allocator which is developed by carrier to get discounted broadband access. The ad allocator matches mobile ads with user profiles based on subscriber X  X  location information and current velocity. 3.3 Personalized Ad Matching Personalized ad matching can be regarded as an information retrieval problem. In other words, we can calculate similarity between the user information and the ad information with combination of various IR models. Our ad matching algorithm is given in Algorithm 1, which contains 3 steps: ad filtering, content similarity computation and adjustment. In our opinion, we try to find the ad which is satisfying the user needs from context information. That is, we suppose probably the user needs, and then we select the most related ad though the scoring function of the candidate ads.

First, we calculate the radius, the available distance, Radius ,whichauser u can arrive in m minutes. Assuming the velocity of the user u is v ,thenweget Radius = v  X  m . The mobile ads in this range is denoted by R ( u )= { a | d ( a, u ) &lt; Radius } where d ( a, u ) represents the distance between the user u and the store of the ad a .

Next, for each candidate ad, we calculate the content similarity score between ad a and user u . The long-term factors include the promotion activity and five product category, which are binary attributes, so we calculate them by Jaccard similarity Jaccard ( u, a ). Furthermore, the short-term factor, represented by user query, q ( u ) is compared with ad titles t ( a ) and landing pages p ( a )togetthe cosine similarity, denoted by Cos ( v 1 ,v 2 )= v 1  X  v 2 . Note that Jaccard similarity scores can sometimes dominate the con tent similarity score. So, the Jaccard similarity score is multiplied by a weighted value  X  ,  X   X  [0 . 1 , 0 . 2].
Finally, after the calculation of conten t similarity, if the highest score of the filtered ads in R(u) is less than  X  , then the top k ads with discounted content similarity score are added based on distance average. For ads with distance less than average distance, the disco unted score is calculated by Sim discounted ( u, a )= 0 . 5  X  Sim score ( u, a ); while, for ads with distance larger than average distance, the discounted score is calculated by Sim discounted ( u, a )=0 . 3  X  Sim score ( u, a ). On completion of ordering the scores, we can get the ads that are most appropriate for the user u .
 Algorithm 1. The personalized ad matching algorithm contain ad filtering, content similarity computation and adjustment. In general, the information of mobile ads is acquired from the advertiser when the advertiser registers the ad vertisement with the telecommunication. However, we didn X  X  have a massive amount of mobile ads in live data because this framework does not run in a real business environment. Thus, we build a mobile ad collector, collecting ads from online advertisements. 4.1 Ad-crawler Platform We proposed a mobile ad collector, which collect online advertisements automat-ically from Google AdSense 3 as shown in [4], [5]. First, we choose some general topic words as the query term to request web pages from search engines such as Google and Yahoo! About 200,000 web pages are retrieved as our web page set. Next, we place these web pages on the ad-clawer platform to obtain the corresponding online ads assigned by Google AdSense. The information of these online advertisements consisted of hyperlink, title and abstract. We collect 54,709 online ads. In order to calculate the similarity between the user and the ad, we extract features including postal address, promotion activity, product category and user query (or the brand name) as the mobile ads factors in our system. We extracted these features for each online ad from its landing page as follows. 4.2 Ad Feature Extraction Postal Address Extraction. The landing page of each online advertisement may contain the location information for consumers. A landing page could even contain more than one postal address. For example, the location search page for KFC 4 lists ten postal addresses in one web page. Thus, an ad could be associated with more than one postal address. Unfortunately, only 4,003 online advertisements contain postal addresses (a total of 9,327 postal addresses are extracted). Hence, we randomly assign a geographic coordinates around a user to each online advertisement. Using Google Map API, we convert each geographic coordinates into a postal address.
 Text Preprocessing. Before introducing the promotion activity identification and the product category classification, the landing page of each online adver-tisement is processed for term representation. The preprocessing steps include HTML tag removal, tokenization, stemming, etc. Finally, we count term fre-quency in each landing page. To be brief, the text preprocessing is a process to translate the raw landing pages into term features and term frequency. Promotion Activity Identification. The promotion activity identification is regarded as a classification task. The promotion classifier is implemented with the tool WEKA 5 using bag of words representation. We train a model to classify whether an ad contains promotional information with supervised learning. We manually label 550 online ads with postal addresses in Illinois for 10-fold cross validation. The (weighted) average precision, recall and F-Measure are about 88.9%.
 Category Classification. Five classes including delicacies, clothing, residence, transportation and life service are used for product categories. To prepare train-ing data, we define some query keywords f or each category (except for the last category: life service), and use an IR sys tem to retrieval top relevant ads for manual labeling. Relevant ads are used ad positive examples, while negative ex-amples are chosen randomly. For each categorization task, around 300 training examples including equal number of positive and negative examples are collected for training data. Then, a binary classifier is trained by state-of-the-art learning algorithm using 10-fold cross-validations. Note that if an ad is not classified to any category, we attribute it with the life service category. In brief, we make use of an IR system to prepare the training data for each product. Table 1 shows the performance (weighted average) of t he categorization t asks are acceptable (above 90%) except for the category  X  X esidence X  (81.4%). We built a simulated platform to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The location of the experiment is set at Illinois, USA. Two situations are copied in the simulated platform: surrounding situation is when the user goes around without particular destination, while route situation is when the user travels from a start location to some end location. The simulated platform is a web site written in HTML, Java Script and PHP.

Table 2 shows preliminary result of the proposed approaches with 30 subjects, each with 20-25 runs of tests. At each run, the user is presented with four ads se-lected by four approaches shown randomly. The evaluation is measured by preci-sion, recall and F-measure per user base a nd then averaged over all subjects. The first row shows the performance of the proposed approach, which includes all four factors, while the second row shows the per formance of user information involving long-term interests (promotion activity and product category) and short-term in-terests (user query) but excluding localit y factor. We also show the performance of the locality factor and random selection as a comparison. The proposed approach has the best precision (49.4%), recall (36.9%) and F-measure (40.1%). Mobile devices are more and more popular and vital for people X  X  life. So, mobile advertising will be an important market for web monetization. Google and Ap-ple have launched their mobile advertising strategies through AdMob and iAd, which will bring revenue for the OS providers by sharing profits with program-mers. While telecommunication still have a hard time increasing the number of broadband subscriptions since many student users still consider the cost to be the main issue. In this paper, we propose the framework that is a triple-win for the telecommunication, the mobile advert isers and the subscribers. We address the three key issues: (1) how to show the mobile ads, (2) when to show the mobile ads and (3) what potential mobile ads will be click by the subscribers. Our system recommends mobile ads to the users based on the factors of velocity-detection and content-match. In order to conduct experiments, we also design a mobile ad collector, which crawls online advertisements automatically. The pre-liminary result shows that ad allocation based on all factors (locality, product category, promotion and user query) can achieve the best performance.
