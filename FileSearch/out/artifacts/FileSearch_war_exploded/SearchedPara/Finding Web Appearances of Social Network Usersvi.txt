 With the rapid growing of Web 2.0, people spend more time on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. In order to know the people they are interacting with, finding the web appearances of them will help the social network users to a great extent. We propose a novel and effective latent factor model to find web appearances of target social net-work users. Our method solves the name ambiguity problem by simultaneously exploring the link structure of social net-works and the web. Experiments on real-world data show the superiority of our method over several baselines.

Searching web pages related to a person in search engines is a common experience of web users [2]. This is because the web is a rich knowledge base of people and web users would like to search the web appearances of their friends or acquaintances to know more about them. With the rapid growing of social networks, web users spend more time on social networks to join in activities via interacting with oth-er people. Finding web appearances of other users on social networks will meet the user demands to a great extent, be-cause this will help them know more about each other and have better communications and interactions. In this pa-per, we propose a novel and effective model to find the web appearances of targeting social network users.  X

Name ambiguity is a major obstacle of finding web ap-pearances for specific persons, especially the unknown aver-age Joes. Fortunately, social networks like Facebook provide rich user information such as user profiles, friends relations, which are very useful for disambiguating web appearances. Here we propose a novel and effective latent factor model to find the low dimensional representations of users and web pages then measure the relevance between them as a key element for judgement. Our method not only utilizes the information provided by social networks, but also considers the link structure of web pages. Our experiments show all these considered elements combined help improve targeting the web pages of a specified social network user.
Past related research about finding web appearances has focused much on name disambiguation by grouping web pages into clusters, each corresponding to a real person [4, 6, 5]. Han [3] enhanced name disambiguation by exploiting the semantic knowledge existed in multiple knowledge sources. Bekkerman [1] disambiguated a group of people in a mail list based on clustering models.
In latent factor model, we try to determine the low di-mensional representations for social network users and web pages. In the first step, we format queries by combining each user X  X  information such as names, colleges, occupations then use them to retrieve in a search engine. All the retrieved we-b pages are web appearances candidates of targeting users because they contain their names. W is defined as the ini-tial relevance score between social network users and web pages. This matrix can be regarded as a noisy observation of the grant truth and it actually provides a lower bound of the name disambiguation performance. Many strategies can be used to define W , such as the text similarity between a user profile and a web page, or the retrieval score returned by the search engine, etc. In our experiment, W i,j is simply defined as a binary indicator of whether the name of user i appears in web page j . To consider the observed entries in W , the latent factors are designed to meet the following requirement: where U =[ u 1 ,u 2 ,  X  X  X  ,u N ] ,V =[ v 1 ,v 2 ,  X  X  X  ,v M and v i  X  R d are latent factors of user i and page j respec-tively. N is the number of users and M is the number of web pages. d is the dimension of latent factors.
To consider the social relations in disambiguation, we try to smooth a user X  X  latent factors by considering his neighbor-hoods. The smoothing strategy can be expressed as below: Here  X  e is a constant for scaling, E is the adjacent matrix of the social network. This is based on an intuitive assumption that if two users have neighbor relationships like friends, they are tend to be more similar than others. Similarly, we also smooth the web pages X  latent factors by meeting the following requirement: Here P is the adjacent matrix of web pages. However, the relations between web pages are not explicitly defined as so-cial relations. Here we assume that if two web pages contain a hyperlink to the same page or one of them link to the oth-er, there is a link between them. This is also based on an intuitive assumption that if two web pages are close on the web, the content of them will be more relevant than others. Considering all the elements mentioned above, we use Frobenius norm and a linear combination strategy to express the requirements as the following optimization problem: min
Mathematically, solving this optimization problem can be equivalently written as optimization over C as where C = U V UV , C 0 =  X  e EW W  X  optimal solution to C can be obtained by performing sin-gular value decomposition on C 0 .  X  e and  X  p specify the influence strength of social relations and the web link struc-ture on latent factor model respectively. After getting the latent factors, we obtain the relevance score between a user and a web page by calculating the inner product of their factors. These relevance scores indicates the probability of a web page is the web appearance of a specified user and we use them to rank the web pages for each user as the final displayed results.
Two social network data sets are derived from a popu-lar social network site in our experiments. We begin with a single user and expanded the user-base by following their friends X  links. To ensure there are enough neighbors for each person, we remove the nodes whose degree is less than five in the base. With two different seeds, we get two user sets, an academia set containing 271 researchers from the areas of information retrieval, bioinformatics, and an industry set containing 254 employees in a software company. For each data set, 20 users with serious name ambiguities are used to format queries and retrieve the top 100 web pages from a search engine, and finally there are 4000 web pages for evaluation. Pages with no links and pdf files are disregard-ed while evaluation. Each web page is manually labeled as relevant or non-relevant to the given user and the perfor-mance are measured by using mean average precision and Searche Engine 0.3613 0.2900 0.3419 0.2850 Table 1: Evaluation Results on Both Data Sets P@10. For comparison, the first baseline is that pages are ranked the same as in the order returned by search engine. The second baseline, co-occurrence method ranks the pages by counting the names of a user X  X  friends appeared in each page. In another baseline we identify the largest connect-ed subgraph in all retrieved pages as the central cluster G , then rank web pages according to the Euclidean distances to the center of G . Here the links of web pages is the same as the ones in latent factor model. This is based on an intuitive assumption that the web pages in central cluster are more likely to be web appearances of the social network users, as mentioned in [1]. Table 1 shows the performances of the baselines and the latent factor model. The low per-formance of search engine results indicate the seriousness of name ambiguity. The co-occurrence method greatly im-proves upon the search engine results on both data set. This shows that the social relations provide valuable context in-formation for name disambiguation, even with a relatively naive model. Using the link structure of the web as context knowledge, the result of the clustering model is substantially better than co-occurrence method. Compared to the clus-tering baseline, latent factor model achieves 7 . 0% and 13 . 8% improvement on two data sets in terms of MAP and perform-s the best. Our experiments show that the performance is relatively insensitive to  X  e and  X  p . According to the overall best performance these parameters are set as  X  e =1and  X  p = 1. Similarly the dimension of latent factors d is set as 20. In summary, evaluation results indicate that both the social network structure and the link structure of the web can help reduce name ambiguity, and our proposed latent factor model makes effective use of these information and performs superior to all the competing models.
