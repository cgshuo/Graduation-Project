 With the advance of web technology, many micro-blogging websites are emerging rapidly. This kind of websites allows users not only to publish their views but also to share interests online. Twitter is one of the most famous micro-blogging services [14, 15], while in China Tencent Weibo is one of the largest micro-blogging websites, and it provides the similar social-networking functionality with Twitter. 
A user registered in Tencent provides his profile information such as gender and date of birth, and publishes messages from time to time. Different people have differ-ent publishing frequency. Some are very active and some are very inactive. Besides, called  X  X ollower X , while the one who is followed is called  X  X riend X . After a  X  X ollow X  thermore, follower can retweet a message or leave a comment to it if he or she is in-terested in the content. Unlike users registered in Twitter, users in Tencent can append some words when he retweets the message from others. Besides, a user is allowed to all of the above-mentioned information. For convenience, we call user X  X  profile in-formation and messages posted text information and social connection relationships regarding follow , retweet , comment and mention link information. 
As we know, the number of micro-blogging users increased rapidly. A statistic from a newspaper shows that, the number of Tencent Weibo users has reached 310 million and the number of active users has reached 50 million up to November 2011. existing billions of actively engaged users. Although the large number of Tencent Weibo users benefit each other by information sharing, too much information results in information overload problem, which n eeds systems such as searching and recom-mender system to solve. Thus, it X  X  really important to capture user interests and then provide personalized results and meet user  X  X  needs individually according to one X  X  interests. 
There are many good ways [1, 2, 3] to infer user X  X  interests, however, most of them are not proposed for the social network. In these approaches user interest models are built according to the behavior history during web search, such as click-through web pages. For users in social network, the mainly behaviors are communication with the social network. These algorithms mine user X  X  interests through user contents such as micro-blog messages and user-generated tags. However, in social network there are representative of all of his interests, and only a small part of users provide tags. Espe-generated tags and micro-blog messages are difficult to get. Another kind of existing user, its interests will not affect the target user X  X  neighbors, which is unreasonable. In this paper, we emphasize mutual reinforcement between users through a process simi-lar to random walk [16, 18]. 
Our proposed method is based on the homophily in social network. The phenome-non of homophily means that individuals with similar characteristics tend to associate with each other. Although homophily has been validated in different social networks such as twitter and student homepages [13, 17, 19], it isn X  X  studied deeply in Tencent Weibo. As Tencent Weibo is mainly for Chinese users, and the culture and some in-social connections reflect homophily and which one contributes more to interest shar-user interests (Detail is explained in Section 3.1). Existing work has studied semantics relationships such as comment, besides follow, retweet and mention. 
According to this study, a conclusion that users with communication behaviors ment the approach. In this algorithm, first a directed graph to indicate potential inter-est propagation among users is constructed. And then text information is used to gen-other in interests. Then, a mutual reinforcement process based on a random walk model is conducted to infer interests for new users and inactive users. Our work offers two contributions. 
First, we studied the relationship between social connections such as follow, ret-weet, comment and mention and common interests between users. Statistical study shows that different social behaviors have different influence on the interest similarity between users. We find that follow and retweet mean more strong connections for users in common interests than mention and comment. 
Second, we propose a novel approach combining users X  text information and link information (information about social connec tion) to infer interests for inactive users. In this approach, the mutual reinforcement between users is emphasized by a random walk model. Experiments show that this approach can improve the accuracy by up to too little information. is given. The proposed algorithm is introduced in section 3. Experiment setup and results are described in section 4. In section 5, related work is discussed. Finally, con-clusions are drawn in section 6. Let U be the set of users registered in a social media website such as Tencent WeiBo. Each user has a unique ID assigned by the system. In this paper, interest is defined as a pair of keyword and its weight about this keyword. For active users, keywords can be extracted from the text information of the user. Weight shows the favorite degree of the user to this keyword. The larger the weight is, the more the user likes the inter-est. One user can have one or more interests. Thus, a vector of pairs of keyword and weight is used to express the interests of users as shown in the definition below: weight. Example of interest information is shown in Table 1, where each integer represents a keyword, followed by weight. Further, the interests of a user a can be expressed by a user X  X  interest keywords. The other kind of information is the link information between every pair of users. For users registered in Tencent Weibo, th e basic behavior information between two users is the  X  X ollow X  relationship. Besides, there are several other behaviors between two users, including  X  X etweet (publishing other user X  X  message) X ,  X  X ention (mention-ing other users when publish a message) X ,  X  X omment (having a comment on other user X  X  message) X  and so on. These behaviors create links between users, which will be showed in Table 2. And the other behavior information, such as  X  X etweet X ,  X  X ention X  and  X  X omment X  is given in Table 3, which shows the numbers of times of these dif-ferent behaviors happened from user a to user b . 
According to link information, a directed behavior graph G ( V , E ) can be con-user a has any action of follow, retweet, mention and comment to user b , an edge ( a , b ) is formed from user a to user b . gation graph is constructed to model how user interest propagates, in which a node is there is an edge from the node b to node a . The direction of the edge is exactly oppo-about his interests. Thus, the interests should propagate from user b to user a . Besides, there is a weight assigned to this edge to indicate the influence on interests user b has information of users. However, first, not every user has this value, because some new registered users have little information published. And second, it X  X  not easy to collect little information. Thus, our mining task is to infer interests for these users in the net-work. 3.1 Hypothesis Tests wered to prove whether this approach is valid.  X  X ention X  relationships in micro-blogging system in China have more similar inter-ests than those without? 
Besides these four questions directly related to the four kinds of link information information is also discussed with the link information. Thus, another similar question is raised. Question 5: Do users who have more common friends in Chinese micro-blogging system have more similar interests than those without? 
To answer these questions, we give the definition of interest similarity of two users as follows: Definition 2. Interest similarity of two users a and b can be measured by Equation 1. v information. 
Question 1 can be formalized as a two-sample t -test. Let u follow be the mean interest u show that the answers of Question 2, 3, and 4 are positive, and the null hypothesis is Equation 2 is used to measure the ratio of the common friends between two users. F and F b are the friend sets of user a and b separately. When selecting users who are used in hypothesis test, the users whose  X  X ommon friends X  measurement are larger level  X  = 0.05 with a p -value of 2 X 10 -3 . 
From these tests, we know that all the answers to these questions are positive, which shows that users who have these behaviors (follow, retweet, comment, mention and common friends) are more similar than users who don X  X . Based on this outcome, a novel approach to infer user interests is proposed in the next part. 3.2 Random Walk Based Inference Model struct the propagation graph. We will explain how to construct the graph later. show its follow relationship. f , and also is followed by user b and c . In Fig. 2, the direction of interest propagation propagates interests to user b and c . vector can extracted from the messages he published, retweeted or commented. On the other hand, based on the finding in the previous section, some information sharing behaviors indicate the common interests between users. Thus, interest information can also be inferred from those users who have link relationship with them. The interests are propagated to the user in a certain probability, which is expressed by weight of the corresponding in-degree edge. We denote this probability by w ij on edge ( u j , u i ). For example, the probability of the interests propagating from user d to user a is denoted as w ad , as shown in Fig. 3. Combining the two resources of information, for user a , his interests according to this method is inferred by Equation 3. dering both text and link information, and  X  is the decaying factor of influence from user X  X  in-degree neighbors. The lower  X  is, the less influence a user will be got from his friends, and vice versa. 
According to this formula, the interests can be computed recursively, because users influence each other during the information sharing behaviors. Thus, a random walk process is utilized to implement the mutual reinforcement between users. 
Suppose the whole propagation matrix is denoted as P . P is a | U|  X | U| matrix, where each entry is equal to w ij , as we described above. All users X  interest vectors are col-the matrix v is the interest vector extracted from text information of user i . Then the interests of all users in network can be computed. 
The interest matrix of the users, denoted as I , where row j represents user j  X  X  inter-and represents the interests after t times of iterations, t &gt; 0. Initially, I 0 = v . According to the property of Markov chain, convergence is guaranteed if P is stochas-tic. In the next sections, we introduce how to compute the weight of the propagation graph and make sure that P satisfies this requirement. 3.3 Generating Interest Vector from Text Information people add few tags in the system, thus other information, such as messages one posted, himself and also those retweeted from others. And for all users in the website, a set of Allocation ( LDA ) [5, 12] model is applied to these documents, which is an unsupervised machine learning technique to identify latent topic from large document collection. 3.4 Assigning Weights to Edges In the social media websites like Tencent Weibo micro-blogging system, users can communicate with each other by retweet, co mment and mention behaviors. According weight of edge ( b, a ) in propagation graph. Based on Retweet We measure the influence of user b to user a based on the amount of user b  X  X  tweets retweeted by user a . The more tweets retweeted by user a , the more influence user b has to user a , and the more common interests occurs between user a and user b . Let RT ab be the number of tweet retweeted by user a from user b . The weight is measured by Equation 5. Based on Comment shows interests on the tweets of user b . Let CM ab be the number of comments user a gives to user b . Then the weight of the edge from user b to user a is calculated like by Equation 6. Based on Mention Mention action is another communications between two users. To some extent, the number of  X  X ention X  actions user a gives to user b , then we measure the weight ac-cording to Equation 7. Based on Follow Relationship user b himself. Thus, this kind of relationship can reflect the relationship between two to this, the weight of the edge from user b to user a is measured by Equation 8, where f =1 if user a follows user b , otherwise, f ab =0. Based on Intersection of Friends For user a and user b , the larger the set of intersection of their friends, the more inter-friends of user b . Then the influence user b has on user a can be calculated according to this Equation 2. And then the weight on the edge ( b , a ) in the propagation graph is measured by Equation 9. Considering this will generate a matrix with so many non-zero numbers, we neglect those values which are smaller than 0.1. Through this process, the non-zero values are reduced to 422380, which makes the matrix sparse and improves the efficiency of iteration. 
If the denominators in Equations 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 are zeros, 1/| U | is used to replace the formula. Combining these five factors, a comprehensive computation formula is pro-posed in Equation 10. After these factors are defined, the propagation matrix on interests can be identified. From these computation formulas, each row in the propagation matrix is sum up to 1, which makes the propagation matrix stochastic. This makes sure the iteration process will converge. 4.1 Dataset A large dataset collected from Tencent weibo is provided by the Tencent Company. rithm. After this extraction process, the total number of users in U is 5238. For every pair of users in U , the corresponding information is also extracted, including the fol-low relationship, the number of  X  X etweet X ,  X  X omment X , and  X  X ention X  actions. Table 4 shows some information of this dataset U . The distribution of the followers for each user is shown in Fig. 4. 
Basically, this distribution of followers per user follows a power-law distribution approximately. That is, most people have small number of followers, while only a data extracted is reasonable and representative. # of users 5 , 238 # of users in trainin g 4 , 190 # of users in test set 1 , 048 # of follow relation-133 , 825
For each user in the network, keywords information is extracted from messages posted. The number of distinct keywords for all 5238 users is 22376, and the average number of keywords which one user has is 29. A five-fold cross validation is con-whose interest vectors are regarded as truth. In the experiment, the text information of users in training set and the link information of users both in training set and test set are utilized to infer interests for users in test set. 4.2 Performance Comparison We conduct experiments based on five different behavior factors,  X  X etweet X ,  X  X ention X ,  X  X omment X ,  X  X ollow X  and  X  X ommon friends X . Correspondingly, we denote these me-separate experiment is conducted to compare which factor performs better. To combine all of these factors, five weights need to be determined. We extract a part of data from Based on the NDCG values, we set the five weights. The larger the NDCG value is, the w sum of absolute errors of each entry of the result matrix is used. In our experiment, this value is set to 0.1. When the sum of the absolute errors is smaller than 0.1, the iterations will stop and the method get final results for each user in the test set. 
Comparison against related algorithm is also conducted. The work in [4] is one of the classic related works in inferring interests. In this paper, user interests are inferred from his social connections, that is, his friends, friends X  friends and 3-degree friends. Table 5. Common Friends ( CF ) 0.3360 
From Table 5 we observe that the factor of common friends has more significant impact than the other four factors. The method based on follow relationship also works better, with NDCG only less than the one based on common friends. However, the methods based on  X  X omment X  and  X  X ention X  don X  X  work very well. The reason why the performance of these two methods is not very well will be studied later. Be-sides, the method based on five comprehensive factors outperforms all the other me-method, 3 D -Friends , by 21.4%. The number of edges of the propagation graph based on each factor is shown in Table 6. For a graph that has 5238 nodes, the total number of edges of complete graph is 5238 X 5238=27436644. When the factor of  X  Common Friends  X  is considered, the graph is complete with a large number of edges. We reduce the number of edge con-structed based on  X  Common Friends  X  to improve the efficiency. If the weights com-puted based on  X  Common Friends  X  factor is smaller than 0.1, the corresponding edge reduced to 422380, which make the matrix sparse and improve the efficiency of com-putation. Accordingly, the number of edges of the  X  Combination  X  method is not very which makes the propagation matrix sparse, too. For the other four factors, the num-propagation matrix based on  X  X etweet X  or  X  X ollow X  has more non-zero values than those based on  X  X omment X  and  X  X ention X . This tells us that users prefer to follow the others and retweet the tweets more than co mment or mention others. Basically, based on the comparison we can conclude that different user behaviors have different im-pact on user interests, which is same with the conclusion with Adamic and Adar [19], that is, some factors are better indicator s of social connections than others. 
We also compare the efficiency of our method with 3 D -Friends , which is illu-strated in Fig. 5. From this Figure, we know that the time spent is proportional to the number of the non-zero values in the propagation matrix. The efficiency of our me-thod based on mention, comment, retweet or follow is better than the method 3 D -Friends . Time spent on common friend graph and the combination graph is more than uses. 4.3 Effect of Decay Factor In this experiments described in the last section, we set the decaying factor  X  to 0.5. However, this decaying factor determines the important degree of the influence from a user X  X  friends. The result of the algor ithm will differ according to different decaying factor. Fig. 6 shows the changes of the results NDCG of all our six algorithms based on different decaying factor values. 
From Fig. 6 we can observe that in most scenarios NDCG gets the best when  X  is between 0.4 to 0.6. However, the changes caused by different decaying factors are not the results of the five methods remains similar. 
The value of decaying factor has influence on not only the accuracy of the results, but also the efficiency of the algorithms. The number of iterations for different decay-ing factors is shown in Fig. 7. The larger the number of iterations is, the more time the corresponding method spends. From Fig. 7 we can see that the growth trends follow an exponential distribution. In our experiment, the decaying factor  X  is set to 0.5, and the number of iterations is about 21. When  X  is larger than 0.6, the run time increases a lot, and neighbor X  X  influence becomes too heavy in the meantime. user interest study into three groups: 1) based on user contents 2) based on user beha-vior 3) based on social cues. Based on User Contents. Simply, explicit interests can be specified directly from users X  profiles. In addition, other sources can also indicate users X  interests. Some users prefer to use descriptive tags to express wh at they are interested in. Therefore, some like to add these tags to themselves. Although the tags extracted from user micro-blogs can replace the user-generated tags, it still cannot work well for new users and inactive users who have few micro-blogs. Based on User Behaviors. Several algorithms have been proposed based on user behaviors during web search and browsing. Interests are captured from click through intention of a query based on past click history. Kim and Chan [8] proposed a divisive pages. These methods based on user behaviors, especially based on click-through history and web pages are mainly used to personalize user interests in the web search community. However, for users in social network, the click history is too sparse to be from their friends. Based on Social Cues. All of these above-mentioned methods use user individual behaviors, these approaches cannot work well. Therefore, some researchers propose borative filtering systems, Glodberg et. al [3] proposed a method to mine the interests [11] proposed a method to find a user X  X  interests from other users that visit the same page as the user. In addition, another new approach is proposed by Wen and Lin [4]. It focuses on social cues from user X  X  neighbors. In this work, for one target user, the neighbors in his three-degree ego network are considered. That is, for each user, a 3-built based on electronic communication data such email and instant messaging and Web2.0 social content such as social bookmarks and file sharing. The interests of active users in the network are extracted by LDA model from text information. Then inactive users X  interests are computed based on their neighbors in a deterministic way, without considering user X  X  mutual influence. Besides, Welch et al [20] demonstrate that in Twitter platform retweeting is a better indicator of topical interest than follow-ing behavior through the PageRank algorithm.

In our study, we focus on leveraging the social network to infer user interests. The contents from active users are considered as initial interests. These interests are prop-between users. This approach has important differences from the above-mentioned existing work in two aspects. First, unlike the existing methods based on user content and behavior, our proposed approach works well especially for users who have no text information. Second, different from the methods based on social cues, we consid-er the social connections and emphasize the mutual reinforcement among users, in-stead of directly inferring from a couple of friends or similar users. random walk on a propagation graph model is used to emphasize the mutual rein-forcement between users. When constructing the propagation graph, both text infor-and mention are related to the common interests between users. And the experimental connections have different influence to common interests. Experimental results dem-onstrate that our methods get a better performance not only in the quality but also in efficiency. In the future, we will utilize the approach to provide better results for re-commender system in social network. Acknowledgement.
