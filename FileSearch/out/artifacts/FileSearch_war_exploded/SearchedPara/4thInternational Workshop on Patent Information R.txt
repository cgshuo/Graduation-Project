 The 4th International Workshop on Patent Information Re-trieval builds on the experiences of the rst three workshops, to provide its participants an exciting, scienti cally chal-lenging and interactive event, where speci c issues of patent retrieval may be put into the general context of Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management, in order to explore innovative solutions to new and old problems, but also to evaluate and adapt traditional or classic approaches to new problems. This year, we observe an increase in the use of standardized test collections in the contributions received, and, at the same time, new discussion points on how to make such standardized evaluation exercises more accessi-ble to the larger IP community.
 H.0 [ Information Systems Applications ]: General Documentation Patent Retrieval
Now in its fourth edition, PaIR continues to be the venue for researchers to present their results in addressing issues speci c to the patent domain.

Patent information management and retrieval is an active and challenging eld both for researchers and for profes-sional information specialists. Patents play a key role not only in protecting intellectual property but also as a strate-gic business factor in all modern economies. Patent search is a particular challenge to information retrieval and access systems. Amongst the challenges successful patent search systems of the future will have to face we can count: Am ong others, the paper also shows how a general purpose linguistic resource, WordNet, cannot provide improvements for the patent domain. While not surprising in itself, the scienti c proof is welcomed and a basis for development of speci c resources.

One such speci c resource in the patent domain, used for decades in the professional environment, are WIPO's In-ternational Patent Classi cation categories and classes. In their Patent search using IPC Class vectors , Verma and Varma propose a method to generate representative vectors based on the patent's classi cation and that of the docu-ments cited in the patent. Their method of enhancing the document vectors is demonstrated to provide a signi cant improvement over a tf-idf baseline.

Another speci c resource needed for patent retrieval, per-haps more than for other kinds of retrieval, are multilingual thesauri. Nanba and colleagues, in Automatic Construction of a Bilingual Thesaurus using Citation Analysis adapt a method from citation analysis to the alignment of English and Japanese thesauri using the hypernym-hyponym rela-tions (broader-narrower term relations).

Finally, two papers present overviews of speci c areas of the patent retrieval environment. Hanbury and colleagues, in Patent Image Retrieval: a Survey , describe the status of the image retrieval methods as applied to the patent do-main. This is a very important, and, at the same time, very dicult problem, which deserves more attention in the aca-demic community. Then, Lupu, in The Status of Retrieval Evaluation in the Patent Domain , tries to bring new discus-sion points in the issue of evaluation of all these methods. He suggest a Pret-Eval map to help visualize the focus of an evaluation exercise.
Last year, the invited speakers were representatives of na-tional patent oces (Canadian and US). This year, we in-vited again speakers from the industry|practitioners who will give their perspectives on the work done by the re-searchers and the existing landscape in the commercially available tools. Jane List, from the Lighthouse IP Group, a multi-disciplinary service provider in the eld of intellectual property, scienti c and legal information and information processing, will start the workshop by providing an overview of the industry. Stephen Adams, from Magister Ltd., an in-dependent consultancy which provides a range of services to the Scienti c and Technical Information community, will conclude the presentation sessions with his professional per-spective over the work presented this year by the researchers.
