 Much of the work in the field of Natural Lan-guage Processing is founded on an assumption of semantic compositionality: that there are iden-tifiable, separable components of an unspecified inference process that will develop as research in NLP progresses. Tasks such as Named En-tity and coreference resolution, syntactic and shal-low semantic parsing, and information and rela-tion extraction have been identified as worthwhile tasks and pursued by numerous researchers. While many have (nearly) immediate application to real world tasks like search, many are also motivated by their potential contribution to more ambitious Natural Language tasks. It is clear that the compo-nents/tasks identified so far do not suffice in them-selves to solve tasks requiring more complex rea-soning and synthesis of information; many other tasks must be solved to achieve human-like perfor-mance on tasks such as Question Answering. But there is no clear process for identifying potential tasks (other than consensus by a sufficient num-ber of researchers), nor for quantifying their po-tential contribution to existing NLP tasks, let alone to Natural Language Understanding.
 Recent  X  X rand challenges X  such as Learning by Reading , Learning To Read , and Machine Reading are prompting more careful thought about the way these tasks relate, and what tasks must be solved in order to understand text sufficiently well to re-liably reason with it. This is an appropriate time to consider a systematic process for identifying semantic analysis tasks relevant to natural lan-guage understanding, and for assessing their potential impact on NLU system performance .
Research on Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), largely motivated by a  X  X rand challenge X  now in its sixth year, has already begun to address some of the problems identified above. Tech-niques developed for RTE have now been suc-cessfully applied in the domains of Question An-swering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006) and Ma-chine Translation (Pado et al., 2009), (Mirkin et al., 2009). The RTE challenge examples are drawn from multiple domains, providing a rel-atively task-neutral setting in which to evaluate contributions of different component solutions, and RTE researchers have already made incremen-tal progress by identifying sub-problems of entail-ment, and developing ad-hoc solutions for them.
In this paper we challenge the NLP community to contribute to a joint, long-term effort to iden-tify, formalize, and solve textual inference prob-lems motivated by the Recognizing Textual Entail-ment setting, in the following ways: (a) Making the Recognizing Textual Entailment setting a central component of evaluation for relevant NLP tasks such as NER, Coreference, parsing, data acquisition and application, and oth-ers. While many  X  X omponent X  tasks are consid-ered (almost) solved in terms of expected improve-ments in performance on task-specific corpora, it is not clear that this translates to strong perfor-mance in the RTE domain, due either to prob-lems arising from unrelated, unsolved entailment phenomena that co-occur in the same examples, or to domain change effects. The RTE task of-fers an application-driven setting for evaluating a broad range of NLP solutions, and will reinforce good practices by NLP researchers. The RTE task has been designed specifically to exercise tex-tual inference capabilities, in a format that would make RTE systems potentially useful components in other  X  X eep X  NLP tasks such as Question An-swering and Machine Translation. 1 (b) Identifying relevant linguistic phenomena, interactions between phenomena, and their likely impact on RTE/textual inference. Deter-mining the correct label for a single textual en-tailment example requires human analysts to make many smaller, localized decisions which may de-pend on each other. A broad, carefully conducted effort to identify and annotate such local phenom-ena in RTE corpora would allow their distributions in RTE examples to be quantified, and allow eval-uation of NLP solutions in the context of RTE. It would also allow assessment of the potential im-pact of a solution to a specific sub-problem on the RTE task, and of interactions between phenomena. Such phenomena will almost certainly correspond to elements of linguistic theory; but this approach brings a data-driven approach to focus attention on those phenomena that are well-represented in the RTE corpora, and which can be identified with suf-ficiently close agreement. (c) Developing resources and approaches that allow more detailed assessment of RTE sys-tems. At present, it is hard to know what spe-cific capabilities different RTE systems have, and hence, which aspects of successful systems are worth emulating or reusing. An evaluation frame-work that could offer insights into the kinds of sub-problems a given system can reliably solve would make it easier to identify significant ad-vances, and thereby promote more rapid advances through reuse of successful solutions and focus on unresolved problems.

In this paper we demonstrate that Textual En-tailment systems are already  X  X nteresting X , in that they have made significant progress beyond a  X  X mart X  lexical baseline that is surprisingly hard to beat (section 2). We argue that Textual Entail-ment, as an application that clearly requires so-phisticated textual inference to perform well, re-quires the solution of a range of sub-problems, some familiar and some not yet known. We there-fore propose RTE as a promising and worthwhile task for large-scale community involvement, as it motivates the study of many other NLP problems in the context of general textual inference.
We outline the limitations of the present model of evaluation of RTE performance, and identify kinds of evaluation that would promote under-standing of the way individual components can impact Textual Entailment system performance, and allow better objective evaluation of RTE sys-tem behavior without imposing additional burdens on RTE participants. We use this to motivate a large-scale annotation effort to provide data with the mark-up sufficient to support these goals.
To stimulate discussion of suitable annotation and evaluation models, we propose a candidate model, and provide results from a pilot annota-tion effort (section 3). This pilot study establishes the feasibility of an inference-motivated annota-tion effort, and its results offer a quantitative in-sight into the difficulty of the TE task, and the dis-tribution of a number of entailment-relevant lin-guistic phenomena over a representative sample from the NIST TAC RTE 5 challenge corpus. We argue that such an evaluation and annotation ef-fort can identify relevant subproblems whose so-lution will benefit not only Textual Entailment but a range of other long-standing NLP tasks, and can stimulate development of new ones. We also show how this data can be used to investigate the behav-ior of some of the highest-scoring RTE systems from the most recent challenge (section 4). The task of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), as formulated by (Dagan et al., 2006), re-quires automated systems to identify when a hu-man reader would judge that given one span of text (the Text) and some unspecified (but restricted) world knowledge, a second span of text (the Hy-
Figure 1: Some representative RTE examples. pothesis) is true. The task was extended in (Gi-ampiccolo et al., 2007) to include the additional requirement that systems identify when the Hy-pothesis contradicts the Text. In the example shown in figure 1, this means recognizing that the Text entails Hypothesis 1 , while Hypothesis 2 con-tradicts the Text. This operational definition of Textual Entailment avoids commitment to any spe-cific knowledge representation, inference method, or learning approach, thus encouraging applica-tion of a wide range of techniques to the problem. 2.1 An Illustrative Example The simple RTE examples in figure 1 (most RTE examples have much longer Texts) illustrate some typical inference capabilities demonstrated by hu-man readers in determining whether one span of text contains the meaning of another.

To recognize that Hypothesis 1 is entailed by the text, a human reader must recognize that  X  X nother company X  in the Hypothesis can match  X  X ex-Corp X . She must also identify the nominalized relation  X  X urchase X , and determine that  X  X  pur-chased by B X  implies  X  X  acquires A X .
 To recognize that Hypothesis 2 contradicts the Text, similar steps are required, together with the inference that because the stated purchase price is different in the Text and Hypothesis, but with high probability refers to the same transaction, Hypoth-esis 2 contradicts the Text.

It could be argued that this particular example might be resolved by simple lexical matching; but it should be evident that the Text can be made lexically very dissimilar to Hypothesis 1 while maintaining the Entailment relation, and that con-versely, the lexical overlap between the Text and Hypothesis 2 can be made very high, while main-taining the Contradiction relation. This intuition is borne out by the results of the RTE challenges, which show that lexical similarity-based systems are outperformed by systems that use other, more structured analysis, as shown in the next section. Table 1: Top performing systems in the RTE 5 2 -way task.
 Table 2: In each cell, top row shows observed agreement and bottom row shows the number of correct (positive, negative) examples on which the pair of systems agree. 2.2 The State of the Art in RTE 5 The outputs for all systems that participated in the RTE 5 challenge were made available to partici-pants. We compared these to each other and to a smart lexical baseline (Do et al., 2010) (lexical match augmented with a WordNet similarity mea-sure, stemming, and a large set of low-semantic-content stopwords) to assess the diversity of the approaches of different research groups. To get the fullest range of participants, we used results from the two-way RTE task. We have anonymized the system names.

Table 1 shows that many participating systems significantly outperform our smart lexical base-line. Table 2 reports the observed agreement be-tween systems and the lexical baseline in terms of the percentage of examples on which a pair of sys-tems gave the same label. The agreement between most systems and the baseline is about 67% , which suggests that systems are not simply augmented versions of the lexical baseline, and are also dis-tinct from each other in their behaviors. 2
Common characteristics of RTE systems re-ported by their designers were the use of struc-tured representations of shallow semantic content (such as augmented dependency parse trees and semantic role labels); the application of NLP re-sources such as Named Entity recognizers, syn-tactic and dependency parsers, and coreference resolvers; and the use of special-purpose ad-hoc modules designed to address specific entailment phenomena the researchers had identified, such as the need for numeric reasoning. However, it is not possible to objectively assess the role these ca-pabilities play in each system X  X  performance from the system outputs alone. 2.3 The Need for Detailed Evaluation An ablation study that formed part of the of-ficial RTE 5 evaluation attempted to evaluate the contribution of publicly available knowledge resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), and DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) used by many of the systems. The observed contribution was in most cases limited or non-existent. It is premature, however, to conclude that these resources have lit-tle potential impact on RTE system performance: most RTE researchers agree that the real contribu-tion of individual resources is difficult to assess. As the example in figure 1 illustrates, most RTE examples require a number of phenomena to be correctly resolved in order to reliably determine the correct label (the Interaction problem); a per-fect coreference resolver might as a result yield lit-tle improvement on the standard RTE evaluation, even though coreference resolution is clearly re-quired by human readers in a significant percent-age of RTE examples.

Various efforts have been made by individ-ual research teams to address specific capabili-ties that are intuitively required for good RTE performance, such as (de Marneffe et al., 2008), and the formal treatment of entailment phenomena in (MacCartney and Manning, 2009) depends on and formalizes a divide-and-conquer approach to entailment resolution. But the phenomena-specific capabilities described in these approaches are far from complete, and many are not yet invented. To devote real effort to identify and develop such ca-pabilities, researchers must be confident that the resources (and the will!) exist to create and eval-uate their solutions, and that the resource can be shown to be relevant to a sufficiently large subset of the NLP community. While there is widespread belief that there are many relevant entailment phe-nomena, though each individually may be rele-vant to relatively few RTE examples (the Sparse-ness problem), we know of no systematic analysis to determine what those phenomena are, and how sparsely represented they are in existing RTE data.
If it were even known what phenomena were relevant to specific entailment examples, it might be possible to more accurately distinguish system capabilities, and promote adoption of successful solutions to sub-problems. An annotation-side solution also maintains the desirable agnosticism of the RTE problem formulation, by not imposing the requirement on system developers of generat-ing an explanation for each answer. Of course, if examples were also annotated with explanations in a consistent format, this could form the basis of a new evaluation of the kind essayed in the pilot study in (Giampiccolo et al., 2007). As part of our challenge to the NLP commu-nity, we propose a distributed OntoNotes-style ap-proach (Hovy et al., 2006) to this annotation ef-fort: distributed, because it should be undertaken by a diverse range of researchers with interests in different semantic phenomena; and similar to the OntoNotes annotation effort because it should not presuppose a fixed, closed ontology of entail-ment phenomena, but rather, iteratively hypoth-esize and refine such an ontology using inter-annotator agreement as a guiding principle. Such an effort would require a steady output of RTE ex-amples to form the underpinning of these annota-tions; and in order to get sufficient data to repre-sent less common, but nonetheless important, phe-nomena, a large body of data is ultimately needed.
A research team interested in annotating a new phenomenon should use examples drawn from the common corpus. Aside from any task-specific gold standard annotation they add to the entail-ment pairs, they should augment existing explana-tions by indicating in which examples their phe-nomenon occurs, and at which point in the exist-ing explanation for each example. In fact, this latter effort  X  identifying phenomena relevant to textual inference, marking relevant RTE examples, and generating explanations  X  itself enables other researchers to select from known problems, assess their likely impact, and automatically generate rel-evant corpora.

To assess the feasibility of annotating RTE-oriented local entailment phenomena, we devel-oped an inference model that could be followed by annotators, and conducted a pilot annotation study. We based our initial effort on observations about RTE data we made while participating in RTE challenges, together with intuitive conceptions of the kinds of knowledge that might be available in semi-structured or structured form. In this sec-tion, we present our annotation inference model, and the results of our pilot annotation effort. 3.1 Inference Process To identify and annotate RTE sub-phenomena in RTE examples, we need a defensible model for the entailment process that will lead to consistent an-notation by different researchers, and to an exten-sible framework that can accommodate new phe-nomena as they are identified.

We modeled the entailment process as one of manipulating the text and hypothesis to be as sim-ilar as possible, by first identifying parts of the text that matched parts of the hypothesis, and then identifying connecting structure. Our inherent as-sumption was that the meanings of the Text and Hypothesis could be represented as sets of n-ary relations, where relations could be connected to other relations (i.e., could take other relations as arguments). As we followed this procedure for a given example, we marked which entailment phe-nomena were required for the inference. We illus-trate the process using the example in figure 1.
First, we would identify the arguments  X  X MI X  and  X  X nother company X  in the Hypothesis as matching  X  X MI X  and  X  X exCorp X  respectively, re-quiring 1 ) Parent-Sibling to recognize that  X  X ex-Corp X  can match  X  X ompany X . We would tag the example as requiring 2 ) Nominalization Resolu-tion to make  X  X urchase X  the active relation and 3 ) Passivization to move  X  X MI X  to the subject po-sition. We would then tag it with 4 ) Simple Verb Rule to map  X  X  purchase B X  to  X  X  acquire B X . These operations make the relevant portion of the Text identical to the Hypothesis, so we are done.
For the same Text, but with Hypothesis 2 (a neg-ative example), we follow the same steps 1 -3 . We would then use 4 ) Lexical Relation to map  X  X ur-chase X  to  X  X uy X . We would then observe that the only possible match for the hypothesis argument  X  X or $3 . 4 Bn X  is the text argument  X  X or $ 2 Bn X . We would label this as a 5) Numerical Quantity Mis-match and 6) Excluding Argument (it can X  X  be the case that in the same transaction, the same com-pany was sold for two different prices).

Note that neither explanation mentions the anaphora resolution connecting  X  X hey X  to  X  X raders X , because it is not strictly required to determine the entailment label.

As our example illustrates, this process makes sense for both positive and negative examples. It also reflects common approaches in RTE systems, many of which have explicit alignment compo-nents that map parts of the Hypothesis to parts of the Text prior to a final decision stage. 3.2 Annotation Labels We sought to identify roles for background knowl-edge in terms of domains and general inference steps, and the types of linguistic phenomena that are involved in representing the same information in different ways, or in detecting key differences in two similar spans of text that indicate a differ-ence in meaning. We annotated examples with do-mains (such as  X  X ork X ) for two reasons: to estab-lish whether some phenomena are correlated with particular domains; and to identify domains that are sufficiently well-represented that a knowledge engineering study might be possible.

While we did not generate an explicit repre-sentation of our entailment process, i.e. explana-tions, we tracked which phenomena were strictly required for inference. The annotated corpora and simple CGI scripts for annotation are available at
The phenomena that we considered during an-notation are presented in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6. We tried to define each phenomenon so that it would apply to both positive and negative examples, but ran into a problem: often, negative examples can be identified principally by structural differences: the components of the Hypothesis all match com-ponents in the Text, but they are not connected by the appropriate structure in the Text. In the case of contradictions, it is often the case that a key relation in the Hypothesis must be matched to an incompatible relation in the Text. We selected names for these structural behaviors, and tagged them when we observed them, but the counterpart for positive examples must always hold: it must necessarily be the case that the structure in the Text linking the arguments that match those in the Hypothesis must be comparable to the Hypothesis structure. We therefore did not tag this for positive examples.
 We selected a subset of 210 examples from the NIST TAC RTE 5 (Bentivogli et al., 2009) Test set drawn equally from the three sub-tasks (IE, IR and QA). Each example was tagged by both an-notators. Two passes were made over the data: the first covered 50 examples from each RTE sub-task, while the second covered an additional 20 exam-ples from each sub-task. Between the two passes, concepts the annotators identified as difficult to annotate were discussed and more carefully spec-ified, and several new concepts were introduced based on annotator observations.

Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 present information about the distribution of the phenomena we tagged, and the inter-annotator agreement (Co-hen X  X  Kappa (Cohen, 1960)) for each.  X  X ccur-rence X  lists the average percentage of examples la-beled with a phenomenon by the two annotators. Table 3: Occurrence statistics for domains in the annotated data.
 Table 4: Occurrence statistics for hypothesis struc-ture features.

From the tables it is apparent that good perfor-mance on a range of phenomena in our inference model are likely to have a significant effect on RTE results, with coreference being deemed es-sential to the inference process for 35% of exam-ples, and a number of other phenomena are suffi-ciently well represented to merit near-future atten-tion (assuming that RTE systems do not already handle these phenomena, a question we address in section 4). It is also clear from the predominance of Simple Rewrite Rule instances, together with Table 5: Occurrence statistics for entailment phe-nomena and knowledge resources Table 6: Occurrences of negative-only phenomena the frequency of most of the domains we selected, that knowledge engineering efforts also have a key role in improving RTE performance. 3.3 Discussion Perhaps surprisingly, given the difficulty of the task, inter-annotator agreement was consistently good to excellent (above 0 . 6 and 0 . 8 , respec-tively), with few exceptions, indicating that for most targeted phenomena, the concepts were well-specified. The results confirmed our initial intu-ition about some phenomena: for example, that coreference resolution is central to RTE, and that detecting the connecting structure is crucial in dis-cerning negative from positive examples. We also found strong evidence that the difference between contradiction and unknown entailment examples is often due to the behavior of certain relations that either preclude certain other relations holding be-tween the same arguments (for example, winning a contest vs. losing a contest), or which can only hold for a single referent in one argument position (for example,  X  X ork X  relations such as job title are typically constrained so that a single person holds one position).

We found that for some examples, there was more than one way to infer the hypothesis from the text. Typically, for positive examples this involved overlap between phenomena; for example, Coref-erence might be expected to resolve implicit rela-tions induced from appositive structures. In such cases we annotated every way we could find.
In future efforts, annotators should record the entailment steps they used to reach their decision. This will make disagreement resolution simpler, and could also form a possible basis for generating gold standard explanations. At a minimum, each inference step must identify the spans of the Text and Hypothesis that are involved and the name of the entailment phenomenon represented; in addi-tion, a partial order over steps must be specified when one inference step requires that another has been completed.

Future annotation efforts should also add a category  X  X ther X , to indicate for each example whether the annotator considers the listed entail-ment phenomena sufficient to identify the label. It might also be useful to assess the difficulty of each example based on the time required by the anno-tator to determine an explanation, for comparison with RTE system errors.

These, together with specifications that mini-mize the likely disagreements between different groups of annotators, are processes that must be refined as part of the broad community effort we seek to stimulate. In this section, we sketch out ways in which the proposed analysis can be applied to learn something about RTE system behavior, even when those systems do not provide anything beyond the output label. We present the analysis in terms of sample questions we hope to answer with such an analysis. 1. If a system needs to improve its performance, which features should it concentrate on? To an-swer this question, we looked at the top-5 systems and tried to find which phenomena are active in the mistakes they make. (a) Most systems seem to fail on examples that need numeric reasoning to get the entailment de-cision right. For example, system H got all 10 ex-amples with numeric reasoning wrong. (b) All top-5 systems make consistent errors in cases where identifying a mismatch in named en-tities (NE) or numerical quantities (NQ) is impor-tant to make the right decision. System G got 69% of cases with NE/NQ mismatches wrong. (c) Most systems make errors in examples that have a disconnected or exclusion component (ar-gument/relation). System J got 81% of cases with a disconnected component wrong. (d) Some phenomena are handled well by certain systems, but not by others. For example, failing to recognize a parent-sibling relation between entities/concepts seems to be one of the top-5 phenomena active in systems E and H. System H also fails to correctly label over 53% of the examples having kinship relation. 2. Which phenomena have strong correlations to the entailment labels among hard examples? We called an example hard if at least 4 of the top 5 systems got the example wrong. In our annotation dataset, there were 41 hard examples. Some of the phenomena that strongly correlate with the TE labels on hard examples are: deeper lexical relation between words (  X  = 0 . 542 ), and need for external knowledge (  X  = 0 . 345 ). Further, we find that the top-5 systems tend to make mistakes in cases where the lexical approach also makes mistakes (  X  = 0 . 355 ). 3. What more can be said about individual systems? In order to better understand the system behavior, we wanted to check if we could predict the system behavior based on the phenomena we identified as important in the examples. We learned SVM classifiers over the identified phenomena and the lexical similarity score to predict both the labels and errors systems make for each of the top-5 systems. We could predict all 10 system behaviors with over 70% accuracy, and could predict labels and mistakes made by two of the top-5 systems with over 77% accuracy. This indicates that although the identified phenomena are indicative of the system performance, it is probably too simplistic to assume that system behavior can be easily reproduced solely as a disjunction of phenomena present in the examples. 4. Does identifying the phenomena correctly help learn a better TE system? We tried to learn an entailment classifier over the phenomenon identified and the top 5 system outputs. The results are summarized in Table 7. All reported num-bers are 20 -fold cross-validation accuracy from an SVM classifier learned over the features men-tioned. The results show that correctly identify-ing the named-entity and numeric quantity mis-matches improves the overall accuracy signifi-cantly. If we further recognize the need for knowl-edge resources correctly, we can correctly explain the label for 80% of the examples. Adding the entailment and negation features helps us explain the label for 97% of the examples in the annotated corpus.

It must be clarified that the results do not show the textual entailment problem itself is solved with 97% accuracy. However, we believe that if a system could recognize key negation phenomena such as Named Entity mismatch , presence of Ex-cluding arguments , etc. correctly and consistently, it could model them as a Contradiction features in the final inference process to significantly im-prove its overall accuracy. Similarly, identifying and resolving the key entailment phenomena in the examples, would boost the inference process in positive examples. However, significant effort is still required to obtain near-accurate knowledge and linguistic resources. NLP researchers in the broader community contin-ually seek new problems to solve, and pose more ambitious tasks to develop NLP and NLU capabil-ities, yet recognize that even solutions to problems which are considered  X  X olved X  may not perform as well on domains different from the resources used to train and develop them. Solutions to such NLP tasks could benefit from evaluation and further de-velopment on corpora drawn from a range of do-mains, like those used in RTE evaluations.
It is also worthwhile to consider each task as part of a larger inference process, and therefore motivated not just by performance statistics on special-purpose corpora, but as part of an inter-connected web of resources; and the task of Rec-ognizing Textual Entailment has been designed to exercise a wide range of linguistic and reasoning capabilities.

The entailment setting introduces a potentially broader context to resource development and as-sessment, as the hypothesis and text provide con-text for each other in a way different than local context from, say, the same paragraph in a docu-ment: in RTE X  X  positive examples, the Hypothe-sis either restates some part of the Text, or makes statements inferable from the statements in the Text. This is not generally true of neighboring sen-tences in a document. This distinction opens the door to  X  X urposeful X , or goal-directed, inference in a way that may not be relevant to a task studied in isolation.

The RTE community seems mainly convinced that incremental advances in local entailment phe-nomena (including application of world knowl-edge) are needed to make significant progress. They need ways to identify sub-problems of tex-tual inference, and to evaluate those solutions both in isolation and in the context of RTE. RTE system developers are likely to reward well-engineered solutions by adopting them and citing their au-thors, because such solutions are easier to incor-porate into RTE systems. They are also more likely to adopt solutions with established perfor-mance levels. These characteristics promote pub-lication of software developed to solve NLP tasks, attention to its usability, and publication of mate-rials supporting reproduction of results presented in technical papers.

For these reasons, we assert that RTE is a nat-ural motivator of new NLP tasks, as researchers look for components capable of improving perfor-mance; and that RTE is a natural setting for evalu-ating solutions to a broad range of NLP problems, though not in its present formulation: we must solve the problem of credit assignment, to recog-nize component contributions. We have therefore proposed a suitable annotation effort, to provide the resources necessary for more detailed evalua-tion of RTE systems.

We have presented a linguistically-motivated analysis of entailment data based on a step-wise procedure to resolve entailment decisions, in-tended to allow independent annotators to reach consistent decisions, and conducted a pilot anno-tation effort to assess the feasibility of such a task.
We do not claim that our set of domains or phe-nomena are complete: for example, our illustra-tive example could be tagged with a domain Merg-ers and Acquisitions , and a different team of re-searchers might consider Nominalization Resolu-tion to be a subset of Simple Verb Rules . This kind of disagreement in coverage is inevitable, but we believe that in many cases it suffices to introduce a new domain or phenomenon, and indicate its re-lation (if any) to existing domains or phenomena. In the case of introducing a non-overlapping cate-gory, no additional information is needed. In other cases, the annotators can simply indicate the phe-nomena being merged or split (or even replaced). This information will allow other researchers to integrate different annotation sources and main-tain a consistent set of annotations. In this paper, we have presented a case for a broad, long-term effort by the NLP community to coordi-nate annotation efforts around RTE corpora, and to evaluate solutions to NLP tasks relating to textual inference in the context of RTE. We have iden-tified limitations in the existing RTE evaluation scheme, proposed a more detailed evaluation to address these limitations, and sketched a process for generating this annotation. We have proposed an initial annotation scheme to prompt discussion, and through a pilot study, demonstrated that such annotation is both feasible and useful.

We ask that researchers not only contribute task specific annotation to the general pool, and indicate how their task relates to those already added to the annotated RTE corpora, but also in-vest the additional effort required to augment the cross-domain annotation: marking the examples in which their phenomenon occurs, and augment-ing the annotator-generated explanations with the relevant inference steps.

These efforts will allow a more meaningful evaluation of RTE systems, and of the compo-nent NLP technologies they depend on. We see the potential for great synergy between different NLP subfields, and believe that all parties stand to gain from this collaborative effort. We therefore respectfully suggest that you  X  X sk not what RTE can do for you, but what you can do for RTE... X  We thank the anonymous reviewers for their help-ful comments and suggestions.
