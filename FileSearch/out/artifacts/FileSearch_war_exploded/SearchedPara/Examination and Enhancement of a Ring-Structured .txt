 We evaluated the interactive retrieval functionality of the Concentric Ring View according to a series of usability studies. This is a ring structure-based graphical user interface, like a planisphere, for image retrieval with multi-faceted metadata. Attribute values for each facet are arranged on a ring, and retrieved images are displayed in side using search keys derived from the attribute values on the bottom part of the rings. By rotating the rings, users can br owse retrieved images while adjusting search keys. The firs t usability test conducted with thirty six participants confirmed that: (i) novice users, even junior high school students, could use this interface; (ii) users could find images better than anticipated; and (iii) the interface was good at choosing the first relevant imag e, but users could not refine retrieval because they were unable to reuse retrieved results. To solve this problem, we added tw o functionalities, personal history for reuse and relevance feedback . With these improvements, we named the new version of the interface Concentric Ring View F+ . A second usability test with seven participants confirmed the effectiveness of this newer interface.

Ring is a ring-structured interface like a planisphere. Since search and browsing using Ring are carried out in the same space in real time, users can make small changes to search keys while browsing the retrieved results. Using Ring , we constructed an image search system, and performed a usability test with 36 junior high school students. Following this test , we made improvements to Ring to provide more feedback, and named the improved version Concentric Ring View F+ , hereafter abbreviated Ring F+ . Figure 1 shows a screenshot of Ring in an image search system. The outermost ring is a category ring, on which facet names are listed. When a facet name on the category ring is clicked, another attribute values usable as search keys for the facet, and the bottom part of the key ring indicates the search key of the facet. By rotating the key ring , a user can adjust the search key and browse retrieved results. Users can use mu ltiple key rings. The search key priority is shown by key ring order, in which the outer ring has the higher priority. Ring can treat different types of attribute values, such as discrete (e.g. terms), non-circular continuous (e.g. size), and circular continuous values (e.g . color), in a uniformed manner. Retrieved results are displayed inside the rings. They are arranged in concentric circles according to the search key values and their priorities. Higher ranked objects are larger and shown closer to the center; details of a particular image are displayed by placing the cursor on that image. We performed usability tests with 36 third-year junior high school students using an image search system implementing Ring with 10,195 freely available images desi gned for Web pages. The task was to search for three images, namely, background, title plate and button. Simple We b pages were automatically generated with them. For the first, participants were asked to draw the images they wished to search for with colored pencils. Each of the participants, then, used Ring and a directory-based search system to retrieve these three images. To compensate the order effect, the half of the participants used Ring first and the rest used the other system first. The following results were obtained: (i) novice participants who use a computer only at school could operate Ring , and they also preferred Ring ; (ii) participants could choose more relevant relevant image. We, however, found that many participants were confused by two issues. One was that users wanted to be able to see previous browsed images or specified search keys after rotating the rings, and the other was that users could not find similar images because the system provided no way to reformulate search keys automatically according to the retrieved relevant images. To solve the users X  confusion during the usability testing, we considered that the former issue could be solved by saving and inflecting personal histories, and the latter by relevance feedback. We added these feedback paths to Ring , and named the new version of the interface Ring F+ . Figures 2 and 3 show these feedback paths. Ring F+ allows users to save keys and retrieved results at the same time simply by capturing its screen. Users save histories explicitly and browse chronologically. As Figure 2 shows, we prepared a history ring outside the category ring . Users can same way as they adjust the search keys. Relevance feedback, the most popular query reformulation strategy, is usually performed by marking the retrieved results that are relevant [1]. Traditional interfaces often provide sliders or checkboxes for selecting images; a newer approach is a plate for making groups of images; this a pproach implemen ts the concept of query-by-groups [2]. These a pproaches, however, need special tools for reformulating queries. In this ring structure, higher-ranked objects are displayed closer to the center in larger size. When users want to search for similar images (i.e., they want to give an image a higher rank) they simply move that image to the center. The attribute values of the image moved to the center are used as search keys, and the new retrieved results are displayed. This provides query reformulation without breaking the simple ring structure. Figure 3 shows a flowchart of this procedure. First, the images closer to the center are pastel tone, while the outer ones are darker. A user finds one of the outer imag es relevant. After selecting the relevant image, the user drags it to the center, search keys are automatically adjusted, and new, darker images, which are similar to the selected image, are retrieved and displayed. To compare Ring with Ring F+ , we performed usability testing again with seven university student s specializing in art and letters. This task was the same as the previous one, namely, search for three images and make simple Web pages. The following results were obtaine d: (i) participants could find more relevant images using Ring F+ ; (ii) they found Ring F+ functionalities were useful. In the focus group interviewwith participants, we suggested tw o ideas about personal history (namely, timing of saving historie s and how to browse them) and ask their opinions. As for the former idea, they preferred the system for saving their histor ies automatically on performing specific actions such as displayi ng details or dragging the image to the center, because they sometimes forgot to do this saving. As for the latter, they preferred to browse histories by random access, arranging small icons that enable them to jump to specific histories. We improved Ring to provide personal history and relevance feedback so that previously retrie ved results could refine retrieval. Ring F+ allows users to reuse pers onal histories and reformulate search keys simply by selecting their relevant images. We could add these functions and provide intuitive operations without affecting the simple ring structure of Ring . We added two functionalities, pe rsonal history and relevance feedback, to Ring F+ . By means of usability testing, we confirmed that the former was useful (even though the methods for saving timing and browsing we re disputable) and the latter was effectively improved retrieval. Accordingly, we will examine these methods and further improve them. [1] R. Baeza-Yates, and B. Ribeiro-Neto, Modern information [2] Munehiro Nakazato, Ljubomir Manola, and Thomas S. [3] T.
