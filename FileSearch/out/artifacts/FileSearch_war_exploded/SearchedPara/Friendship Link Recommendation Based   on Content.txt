 Link prediction is the problem of predicting the existence of a link between two entities in an entity relationship graph, where prediction is based on the attributes of the observed entities that are either familiar or strange with each other. The problem can be also viewed as a link recommendation problem, where we aim to suggest to the query user a list of people that the user is likely to create new connections to. Link recommendation in social network is closely related to link prediction [4][5], but has its own specific proper-other information such as common interest and interaction. Thus, how to incorporate lenge. Another challenge is the sparsity of real social network, which means that the network graph. It is not feasible to test every user whether the query user will create con-nection to. In this paper, we propose to incorporates both of user X  X  text content and struc-the network users based on the similarity of user X  X  interest and structural features. Then, a weighted graph is constructed for each cluster, and the weighted SimRank algorithm is proposed to estimate the similarity between the query user and each candidate user. Fi-nally, candidates with the greatest similarity values are recommended as the friends of the query user. Our recommendation approach contains two steps. To deal with the sparsity problem, we first filter some of the negative instances by clustering users based on the similarity of structural features and user X  X  interest. Usually, users who have similar interest and structural features are more likely to make friends with each other. Thus, users in the some cluster with the query user compose the candidate list. User X  X  inter-est is mined from the uploaded micro-blog documents using the topic model. The structural features refer to following relationship, such as follower and followee rela-tionship in microblogging site, and social interaction, such as retweeting, mention, and comment between two users in microblogging site. Then, potential friends are recommended from the candidate list. To accomplish this, a weighted graph is con-structed for each cluster, and a weighted SimRank algorithm is proposed to estimate the similarity between users in the same cluster. The users that have the greatest val-ues of similarity with the query user are recommended to create friendship link with the query user. 
Usually, user X  X  interest is reflected by the uploaded micro-blogs. We aggregate all the micro-blogs generated by the same individual user into a profile that corresponds to a document in the LDA model [2]. Then, user X  X  interest is modeled by the profile X  X  probability distribution over topics. To measure the similarity of two users X  interest, we use JSD (Jensen-Shannon-Divergence) to measure the similarity between their two probability distributions over topic. The similarity of structural features is com-posed of two components. The first component is the similarity of social link relation-ships, i.e., followee and follower, and it is estimated as following: where fee i is the set of followees of u i , and fer i The second component is a measure of interactions: where r ij is the times that u i has retweeted u j  X  X  micro-blogs, c commented on u j  X  X  micro-blogs, a ij is the times that u the largest frequency of these interaction in a given dataset. Then, the similarity be-tween two users is a linear combination of interest similarity and structural similarity. 
Then, we introduce a weighted SimRank algo rithm [6] to take the strength of relationship into the estimation of similari ty. We construct a weighted graph for each cluster, in which each node denotes a user and the weight of an edge denotes the strength of the relationship between this pair of users. The similarity value from a node u i is not equally propagated to the out-neighbor nodes. Instead, it is propagated based on the normalized probability estimated as following: where O ( u i ) is the out-neighbor nodes of u i , and Sim ( u edge &lt; u i , u j &gt;. Then the recursive form of the similarity between node u ( k +1) th iteration is represented as following: Meanwhile, the similarity in the initial state is revised as following: To evaluate our approach, two real-life datasets are used in the experiments. The first dataset is collected from Sina Weibo. We sample 10 user ids uniformly at random from the space of Sina Weibo user id numbers, and then we use the width-first search method to visit other users and download the profiles and links of these visited users. The second dataset is published in the SiGKDD Cup Track1 2012, and it is collected from Tecent Weibo. We randomly selected a subset of 51938 users and their links information to build the second dataset. We divided the datasets into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Three methods are used as the baselines. (1) Content-based [3]: it applies the topic modeling techniques, specifically LDA, on user X  X  profile data to recommend link based on interest similarity and existing friendships. (2) Structure-based [1]: it uses random walk algorithm on an augmented social graph with both attribute and link information to recommend links. (3) Na X ve SimRank [6]: it uses the Na X ve SimRank algorithm on the unweighted graph of user relation to iteratively compute the similarity between nodes and then return the top-k ranked nodes. 
We compare the precision and recall of link recommendation of different methods on two datasets, and the results are shown in table 1. The results show that our ap-proach outperforms other approaches obviously. Our approach combines both the interest and structure information to retrieve the potential friends, which is more ef-fective to find the friends that may be neglected by the structure-based or content-based method. Second, we revise the Na X ve SimRank algorithm by assigning each edge with a transforming probability and the initial similarity of two neighbouring nodes with a nonzero value. This revision is more coincident with reality, since the effects of different users on a given user are unequal. Thus, the weight SimRank is also more effective than the Na X ve SimRank. In this paper, we proposed to recommend friendship link based on content and struc-structure features and interests mined from the generated text content, which filters the unrelated users and thus reduces the search space. Then, each user cluster is represented by a weighted graph, and the weighted SimRank is proposed to estimate similarity between two users, and the top-ranked users are recommended to be linked by the query user. Experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our approach can be further improved in several aspects. For example, we can extend our approach to recommend user with other type of ob-jects, such as movie, products, and so on, by including user X  X  relationship with the objects in the approach.
