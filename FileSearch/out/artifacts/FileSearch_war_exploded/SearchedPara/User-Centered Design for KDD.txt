 During initial development, KDD solutions often focus heav-ily on algorithms, architectures, software, hardware, and systems engineering challenges, without first thoroughly ex-ploring how end-users will employ the new KDD technology. As a result of such  X  X ystem-centered X  design, many useless features are implemented that prolong development and sig-nificantly add to life cycle cost, while making the system hard to operate and use. This presentation will describe an alternate  X  X ser-centered X  approach  X  borrowed from the consumer products industry  X  that can produce KDD so-lutions with shorter development cycles, lower costs, and much better usability.
 Eric Haseltine is Director of Research at NSA, where he oversees development of new solutions both for Signals In-telligence and Information Assurance. Prior to joining NSA in 2002, Dr. Haseltine was Executive Vice President of Walt Disney Imagineering, in charge of Research and Develop-ment for all of the Walt Disney Company. He came to Dis-ney after a 13 year career at Hughes Aircraft. He earned a PhD in Physiological Psychology at Indiana University, after which he completed a Post Doctoral fellowship at Vander-bilt Medical School in Neuroanatomy before joining Hughes. He has 12 patents, and over 100 publications in science and technical journals, the web, and Discover Magazine.
