 In this paper we investigate the problem of unsu-pervised part-of-speech tagging when unannotated parallel data is available in a large number of lan-guages. Our goal is to develop a fully joint multilin-gual model that scales well and shows improved per-formance for individual languages as the total num-ber of languages increases.

Languages exhibit ambiguity at multiple levels, making unsupervised induction of their underlying structure a difficult task. However, sources of lin-guistic ambiguity vary across languages. For exam-ple, the word fish in English can be used as either a verb or a noun. In French, however, the noun pois-son (fish) is entirely distinct from the verbal form p  X  echer (to fish). Previous work has leveraged this idea by building models for unsupervised learning from aligned bilingual data (Snyder et al., 2008). However, aligned data is often available for many languages. The benefits of bilingual learning vary markedly depending on which pair of languages is selected, and without labeled data it is unclear how to determine which supplementary language is most helpful. In this paper, we show that it is possi-ble to leverage all aligned languages simultaneously, achieving accuracy that in most cases outperforms even optimally chosen bilingual pairings.

Even in expressing the same meaning, languages take different syntactic routes, leading to variation in part-of-speech sequences. Therefore, an effec-tive multilingual model must accurately model com-mon linguistic structure, yet remain flexible to the idiosyncrasies of each language. This tension only becomes stronger as additional languages are added to the mix. From a computational standpoint, the main challenge is to ensure that the model scales well as the number of languages increases. Care must be taken to avoid an exponential increase in the parameter space as well as the time complexity of inference procedure.

We propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for joint multilingual tagging. The topology of our model connects tagging decisions within a language as well as across languages. The model scales lin-early with the number of languages, allowing us to incorporate as many as are available. For each lan-guage, the model contains an HMM-like substruc-ture and connects these substructures to one another by means of cross-lingual latent variables. These variables, which we refer to as superlingual tags , capture repeated multilingual patterns and thus re-duce the overall uncertainty in tagging decisions.
We evaluate our model on a parallel corpus of eight languages. The model is trained once using all languages, and its performance is tested separately for each on a held-out monolingual test set. When a complete tag lexicon is provided, our unsupervised model achieves an average accuracy of 95%, in com-parison to 91% for an unsupervised monolingual Bayesian HMM and 97.4% for its supervised coun-terpart. Thus, on average, the gap between unsu-pervised and supervised monolingual performance is cut by nearly two thirds. We also examined sce-narios where the tag lexicon is reduced in size. In all cases, the multilingual model yielded substantial performance gains. Finally, we examined the per-formance of our model when trained on all possible subsets of the eight languages. We found that perfor-mance improves steadily as the number of available languages increases. Bilingual Part-of-Speech Tagging Early work on multilingual tagging focused on projecting annota-tions from an annotated source language to a target language (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Feldman et al., 2006). In contrast, we assume no labeled data at all; our unsupervised model instead symmetrically improves performance for all languages by learning cross-lingual patterns in raw parallel data. An addi-tional distinction is that projection-based work uti-lizes pairs of languages, while our approach allows for continuous improvement as languages are added to the mix.

In recent work, Snyder et al. (2008) presented a model for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging trained from a bilingual parallel corpus. This bilin-gual model and the model presented here share a number of similarities: both are Bayesian graphi-cal models building upon hidden Markov models. However, the bilingual model explicitly joins each aligned word-pair into a single coupled state. Thus, the state-space of these joined nodes grows exponen-tially in the number of languages. In addition, cross-ing alignments must be removed so that the result-ing graph structure remains acyclic. In contrast, our multilingual model posits latent cross-lingual tags without explicitly joining or directly connecting the part-of-speech tags across languages. Besides per-mitting crossing alignments, this structure allows the model to scale gracefully with the number of lan-guages.
 Beyond Bilingual Learning While most work on multilingual learning focuses on bilingual analysis, some models operate on more than one pair of lan-guages. For instance, Genzel (2005) describes a method for inducing a multilingual lexicon from a group of related languages. His model first in-duces bilingual models for each pair of languages and then combines them. Our work takes a different approach by simultaneously learning from all lan-guages, rather than combining bilingual results.
A related thread of research is multi-source ma-chine translation (Och and Ney, 2001; Utiyama and Isahara, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007) where the goal is to translate from multiple source languages to a single target language. Rather than jointly training all the languages together, these models train bilin-gual models separately, and then use their output to select a final translation. The selection criterion can be learned at training time since these models have access to the correct translation. In unsupervised set-tings, however, we do not have a principled means for selecting among outputs of different bilingual models. By developing a joint multilingual model we can automatically achieve performance that ri-vals that of the best bilingual pairings. We propose a non-parametric directed Bayesian graphical model for multilingual part-of-speech tag-ging using a parallel corpus. We perform a joint training pass over the corpus, and then apply the parameters learned for each language to a held-out monolingual test set.

The core idea of our model is that patterns of ambiguity vary across languages and therefore even unannotated multilingual data can serve as a learn-ing signal. Our model is able to simultaneously har-ness this signal from all languages present in the corpus. This goal is achieved by designing a sin-gle graphical model that connects tagging decisions within a language as well as across languages.
The model contains language-specific HMM sub-structures connected to one another by cross-lingual latent variables spanning two or more languages. These variables, which we refer to as superlingual tags , capture repeated cross-lingual patterns and thus reduce the overall uncertainty in tagging deci-sions. To encourage the discovery of a compact set of such cross-lingual patterns, we place a Dirichlet process prior on the superlingual tag values. 3.1 Model Structure For each language, our model includes an HMM-like substructure with observed word nodes, hid-den part-of-speech nodes, and directed transition and emission edges. For each set of aligned words in parallel sentences, we add a latent superlingual variable to capture the cross-lingual context. A set of directed edges connect this variable to the part-of-speech nodes of the aligned words. Our model assumes that the superlingual tags for parallel sen-tences are unordered and are drawn independently of one another.

Edges radiate outward from superlingual tags to language-specific part-of-speech nodes. Thus, our model implicitly assumes that superlingual tags are drawn prior to the part-of-speech tags of all lan-guages and probabilistically influence their selec-tion. See Figure 1 for an example structure.
The particular model structure for each set of par-allel sentences (i.e. the configuration of superlingual tags and their edges) is determined by bilingual lexi-cal alignments and  X  like the text itself  X  is consid-ered an observed variable. In practice, these lexical alignments are obtained using standard techniques from machine translation.

Our model design has several benefits. Crossing and many-to-many alignments may be used with-out creating cycles in the graph, as all cross-lingual information emanates from the hidden superlingual tags. Furthermore, the model scales gracefully with the number of languages, as the number of new edges and nodes will be proportional to the number of words for each additional language. 3.2 Superlingual Tags Each superlingual tag value specifies a set of dis-tributions  X  one for each language X  X  part-of-speech tagset. In order to learn repeated cross-lingual pat-terns, we need to constrain the number of superlin-gual tag values and thus the number of distributions they provide. For example, we might allow the su-perlingual tags to take on integer values from 1 to K , with each integer value indexing a separate set of distributions. Each set of distributions should cor-respond to a discovered cross-lingual pattern in the data. For example, one set of distributions might fa-vor nouns in each language and another might favor verbs.

Rather than fixing the number of superlingual tag values to an arbitrary and predetermined size 1 , . . . , K , we allow them to range over the entire set of integers. In order to encourage the desired multi-lingual clustering behavior, we use a Dirichlet pro-cess prior for the superlingual tags. This prior allows high posterior probability only when a small number of values are used repeatedly. The actual number of sampled values will be dictated by the data and the number of languages.

More formally, suppose we have n lan-guages,  X  tive model, a countably infinite sequence of sets h  X  1 , . . . ,  X  some base distribution. Each  X   X  over the parts-of-speech in language  X  .

In parallel, an infinite sequence of mixing compo-nents  X  cess (Sethuraman, 1994). These components define a distribution over the integers with most probabil-ity mass placed on some initial set of values. The two sequences h  X   X  1 and  X  perlingual tags and their associated distributions on parts-of-speech. That is, each superlingual tag z  X  N is drawn with probability  X  z , and indexes the set of distributions h  X   X  1 3.3 Part-of-Speech Tags Finally, we need to define the generative probabili-ties of the part-of-speech nodes. For each such node there may be multiple incoming edges. There will always be an incoming transition edge from the pre-vious tag (in the same language). In addition, there may be incoming edges from zero or more superlin-gual tags. Each edge carries with it a distribution over parts-of-speech and these distributions must be combined into the single distribution from which the tag is ultimately drawn.

We choose to combine these distributions as a product of experts. More formally: for language  X  and tag position i , the part-of-speech tag y according to Where  X  and the z  X  X  range over the values of the incoming superlingual tags. The normalization term Z is ob-tained by summing the numerator over all part-of-speech tags y
This parameterization allows for a relatively sim-ple and small parameter space. It also leads to a desirable property: for a tag to have high probabil-ity each of the incoming distributions must allow it. That is, any expert can  X  X eto X  a potential tag by as-signing it low probability, generally leading to con-sensus decisions.

We now formalize this description by giving the stochastic process by which the observed data (raw parallel text) is generated, according to our model. 3.4 Generative Process For n languages, we assume the existence of n tagsets T 1 , . . . , T n and vocabularies, W 1 , . . . , W one for each language. For clarity, the generative process is described using only bigram transition dependencies, but our experiments use a trigram model. 1. Transition and Emission Parameters: For 2. Superlingual Tag Parameters: 3. Data: For each multilingual parallel sentence,
To perform Bayesian inference under this model we use a combination of sampling techniques, which we describe in detail in the next section. 3.5 Inference Ideally we would like to predict the part-of-speech tags which have highest marginal probability given the observed words x and alignments a . More specifically, since we are evaluating our accuracy per tag-position, we would like to predict, for language index  X  and word index i , the single part-of-speech tag: which we can rewrite as the argmax gral, in which we marginalize over the settings of all tags other than y  X  sition distributions  X  =  X   X  butions  X  =  X   X  perlingual tag parameters  X  = {  X   X  ranges over all part-of-speech tags).

As these integrals are intractable to compute ex-actly, we resort to the standard Monte Carlo approx-imation. We collect N samples of the variables over which we wish to marginalize but for which we can-not compute closed-form integrals, where each sam-ple sample then approximate the tag marginals as:
We employ closed forms for integrating out the emission parameters  X  , transition parameters  X  , and superlingual tag parameters  X  and  X  . We explic-itly sample only part-of-speech tags y , superlingual tags z , and the hyperparameters of the transition and emission Dirichlet priors. To do so, we apply stan-dard Markov chain sampling techniques: a Gibbs sampler for the tags and a within-Gibbs Metropolis-Hastings subroutine for the hyperparameters (Hast-ings, 1970).

Our Gibbs sampler samples each part-of-speech and superlingual tag separately, conditioned on the current value of all other tags. In each case, we use standard closed forms to integrate over all parameter values, using currently sampled counts and hyperpa-rameter pseudo-counts. We note that conjugacy is technically broken by our use of a product form in Distribution 1. Nevertheless, we consider the sam-pled tags to have been generated separately by each of the factors involved in the numerator. Thus our method of using count-based closed forms should be viewed as an approximation. 3.6 Sampling Part-of-Speech Tags To sample the part-of-speech tag for language  X  at position i we draw from where the first two terms are the generative proba-bilities of (i) the current tag given the previous tag and superlingual tags, and (ii) the next tag given the current tag and superlingual tags. These two quan-tities are similar to Distribution 1, except here we integrate over the transition parameter  X  superlingual tag parameters  X   X  product of integrals. Each integral can be computed in closed form using multinomial-Dirichlet conju-gacy (and by making the above-mentioned simpli-fying assumption that all other tags were gener-ated separately by their transition and superlingual parameters), just as in the monolingual Bayesian HMM of (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).

For example, the closed form for integrating over the parameter of a superlingual tag with value z is given by: Z where count ( z, y y language  X  , count ( z,  X  ) is the total number of times that superlingual tag z appears with an edge into lan-guage  X  , and  X 
The third term in the sampling formula is the emission probability of the current word x  X  the current tag and all other words and sampled tags, as well as a hyperparameter which is suppressed for the sake of clarity. This quantity can be computed exactly in closed form in a similar way. 3.7 Sampling Superlingual Tags For each set of aligned words in the observed align-ment a we need to sample a superlingual tag z . Recall that z is an index into an infinite sequence h  X  1 , . . . ,  X  a distribution over the tagset T  X  . The generative dis-tribution over z is given by equation 2. In our sam-pling scheme, however, we integrate over all possi-ble settings of the mixing components  X  using the standard Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) closed form (Antoniak, 1974):
The first term is the product of closed form tag prob-abilities of the aligned words, given z . The final term is the standard CRP closed form for posterior sam-pling from a Dirichlet process prior. In this term, k is the total number of sampled superlingual tags, count ( z i ) is the total number of times the value z i occurs in the sampled tags, and  X  is the Dirichlet process concentration parameter (see Step 2 in Sec-tion 3.4).

Finally, we perform standard hyperparameter re-estimation for the parameters of the Dirichlet distri-bution priors on  X  and  X  (the transition and emis-sion distributions) using Metropolis-Hastings. We assume an improper uniform prior and use a Gaus-sian proposal distribution with mean set to the pre-vious value, and variance to one-tenth of the mean. We test our model in an unsupervised framework where only raw parallel text is available for each of the languages. In addition, we assume that for each language a tag dictionary is available that cov-ers some subset of words in the text. The task is to learn an independent tagger for each language that can annotate non-parallel raw text using the learned parameters. All reported results are on non-parallel monolingual test data.
 Data For our experiments we use the Multext-East parallel corpus (Erjavec, 2004) which has been used before for multilingual learning (Feldman et al., 2006; Snyder et al., 2008). The tagged portion of the corpus includes a 100,000 word English text, Or-well X  X  novel  X  X ineteen Eighty Four X , and its trans-lation into seven languages: Bulgarian, Czech, Es-tonian, Hungarian, Romanian, Slovene and Serbian. The corpus also includes a tag lexicon for each of these languages. We use the first 3/4 of the text for learning and the last 1/4 as held-out non-parallel test data.
 The corpus provides sentence level alignments. To obtain word level alignments, we run GIZA ++ (Och and Ney, 2003) on all 28 pairings of the 8 lan-guages. Since we want each latent superlingual vari-able to span as many languages as possible, we ag-gregate the pairwise lexical alignments into larger sets of aligned words. These sets of aligned words are generated as a preprocessing step. During sam-pling they remain fixed and are treated as observed data.

We use the set of 14 basic part-of-speech tags pro-vided by the corpus. In our first experiment, we assume that a complete tag lexicon is available, so that for each word, its set of possible parts-of-speech is known ahead of time. In this setting, the aver-age number of possible tags per token is 1.39. We also experimented with incomplete tag dictionaries, where entries are only available for words appearing more than five or ten times in the corpus. For other words, the entire tagset of 14 tags is considered. In these two scenarios, the average per-token tag ambi-guity is 4.65 and 5.58, respectively.

Training and testing In the full lexicon ex-periment, each word is initialized with a random part-of-speech tag from its dictionary entry. In the two reduced lexicon experiments, we initialize the tags with the result of our monolingual baseline (see below) to reduce sampling time. In both cases, we begin with 14 superlingual tag values  X  corre-sponding to the parts-of-speech  X  and initially as-sign them based on the most common initial part-of-speech of words in each alignment.

We run our Gibbs sampler for 1,000 iterations, and store the conditional tag probabilities for the last 100 iterations. We then approximate marginal tag probabilities on the training data using Equation 4 and predict the highest probability tags. Finally, we compute maximum likelihood transition and emis-sion probabilities using these tag counts, and then apply smoothed viterbi decoding to each held-out monolingual test set. All reported results are aver-aged over five runs of the sampler.

Monolingual and bilingual baselines We reimplemented the Bayesian HMM model of Gold-water and Griffiths (2007) (BHMM1) as our mono-lingual baseline. It has a standard HMM structure with conjugate Bayesian priors over transitions and emissions. We note that our model, in the absence of any superlingual tags, reduces to this Bayesian HMM. As an additional baseline we use a bilingual model (Snyder et al., 2008). It is a directed graphical model that jointly tags two parallel streams of text aligned at the word level. The structure of the model consists of two parallel HMMs, one for each lan-guage. The aligned words form joint nodes that are shared by both HMMs. These joint nodes are sam-pled from a probability distribution that is a prod-uct of the transition and emission distributions in the two languages and a coupling distribution.

We note that the numbers reported here for the bilingual model differ slightly from those re-ported by Snyder et al. (2008) for two reasons: we use a slightly larger set of sentences, and an im-proved sampling scheme. The new sampling scheme marginalizes over the transition and coupling param-eters by using the same count-based approximation that we utilize for our multilingual model. This leads Table 1 shows the tagging accuracy of our multilin-gual model on the test data, when training is per-formed on all eight languages together. Results from both baselines are also reported. In the case of the bilingual baseline, seven pairings are possible for each language, and the results vary by pair. There-fore, for each language, we present the average accu-racy over all seven pairings, as well as the accuracy of its highest performing pairing.

We provide results for three scenarios. In the first case, a tag dictionary is provided for all words, lim-iting them to a restricted set of possible tags. In the other two scenarios, dictionary entries are limited to words that appear more than five or ten times in the corpus. All other words can be assigned any tag, increasing the overall difficulty of the task. In the full lexicon scenario, our model achieves an average tagging accuracy of 95%, compared to 91% for the monolingual baseline and 93.2% for the bilingual baseline when averaged over all pairings. This ac-curacy (95%) comes close to the performance of the bilingual model when the best pairing for each lan-guage is chosen by an oracle (95.4%). This demon-strates that our multilingual model is able to effec-tively learn from all languages. In the two reduced lexicon scenarios, the gains are even more striking. In both cases the average multilingual performance outpaces even the best performing pairs.

Looking at individual languages, we see that in all three scenarios, Czech, Estonian, Romanian, and Slovene show their best performance with the mul-tilingual model. Bulgarian and Serbian, on the other hand, give somewhat better performance with their optimal pairings under the bilingual model, but their multilingual performance remains higher than their average bilingual results. The performance of English under the multilingual model is somewhat lower, especially in the full lexicon scenario, where it drops below monolingual performance. One pos-sible explanation for this decrease lies in the fact that English, by far, has the lowest trigram tag entropy of all eight languages (Snyder et al., 2008). It is pos-sible, therefore, that the signal it should be getting from its own transitions is being drowned out by less reliable information from other languages.

In order to test the performance of our model as the number of languages increases, we ran the full lexicon experiment with all possible subsets of the eight languages. Figure 2 plots the average accuracy as the number of languages varies. For comparison, the monolingual and average bilingual baseline re-sults are given, along with supervised monolingual performance. Our multilingual model steadily gains in accuracy as the number of available languages in-creases. Interestingly, it even outperforms the bilin-gual baseline (by a small margin) when only two lan-guages are available, which may be attributable to the more flexible non-parametric dependencies em-ployed here. Finally, notice that the gap between monolingual supervised and unsupervised perfor-mance is cut by nearly two thirds under the unsu-pervised multilingual model. In this paper we X  X e demonstrated that the benefits of unsupervised multilingual learning increase steadily with the number of available languages. Our model scales gracefully as languages are added and effec-tively incorporates information from them all, lead-ing to substantial performance gains. In one experi-ment, we cut the gap between unsupervised and su-pervised performance by nearly two thirds. A fu-ture challenge lies in incorporating constraints from additional languages even when parallel text is un-available.
