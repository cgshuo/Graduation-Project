 1. Introduction
Information seeking forms an important and integrated part of problem solving by affecting the quality of a given task solution. While many different models of information seeking have been proposed ( Wilson, 1999 ), implicit in most of them is the assumption that the information seeker is an individual. The cognitive viewpoint in information science, for example, has commonly focused on attributes of the individual in order to understand the cognitive and emotional motivations for information behaviour.
Consequently, the impact of collaborative information behaviour is seldom taken into account by these models, though it is commonly recognized that users often work in groups or in teams that may as well affect their information behaviour, their thoughts and feelings. Ignoring the social and collaborative dimen-sion in information seeking models may affect information system design when providing for a user expe-rience supporting various user roles, needs and types of interactions during a problem solving process.
Recently, researchers in information science have begun to explore the social and contextual dimensions of information behaviour and information seeking, hereby challenging the assumption of the individual information seeker (e.g. Bruce et al., 2002 ; Hertzum, 2000, 2002 ; Ingwersen, 2001 ; Karamuftuoglu, 1998 ;
Prekop, 2002 ; Sonnenwald, 1999 ; Sonnenwald &amp; Pierce, 2000 ; Talja, 2002 ).
In order to explore and gain insight into the characteristics of group members  X  information behaviour and problem solving processes, commonly modelled as individual processes, a qualitative case study was carried out exploring the Information Search Process (ISP) model, developed and verified by Kuhlthau (1991, 1993) , in a group-based setting of students. The study reported took place in 2002 at the Royal School of Library and Information Science.

While the ISP model has contributed to our understanding of factors affecting the information seeking process and has formed the basis of many, also recent, research projects and studies (e.g. Kracker, 2002 ;
Kracker &amp; Wang, 2002 ; Vakkari, 2003 ; Vakkari, Pennanen, &amp; Serola, 2003 ), the model was developed and has been used only to describe individuals  X  processes of construction, not groups  X  processes.
By exploring the ISP model in a group-based setting, the aim of the study has been to contribute to our understanding of the characteristics of collaborative information behaviour which in this study refers to the physical activities and cognitive and emotional experiences of individuals acting as group members, engaged in a collaborative problem solving process involving information (seeking) behaviour .

The paper is composed of six main sections. In order to position the present study and establish the re-search gap in relation to existing work, Section 2 presents the Information Search Process (ISP) model and the characteristics of the individual  X  s process of construction while seeking information, and Section 3 de-scribes and synthesizes the common patterns of previous work on collaborative information (seeking) behaviour. Section 4 describes the research design and the methods and procedures used to collect and ana-lyse the data from the empirical study. Section 5 presents and discusses the findings. Finally, Section 6 con-cludes from the explorative study and presents implications of the findings for theory building and future research to assist information system design. 2. The Information Search Process (ISP) model
Kuhlthau (1991, 1993) developed a model of the information seeking process the information seeker  X  s 4 emotional, cognitive and physical experiences at different stages of the process.
The model was motivated by an interest in investigating why students behave the way they do. Kuhlthau (1991) wanted to address a recognized gap between information systems and users  X  natural process of infor-mation seeking to improve information system design and guide the encountering process made by intermediaries. The model has been tested in two longitudinal studies and has further been verified in two large-scale studies. ( Kuhlthau, 1991, 1993 ).

According to these studies, the ISP can be divided into six stages, which differentiate information searched for, ways of searching and relevance assessments, while moving the seeker from the initial state of a recognized information need to the goal state of resolution. This movement is caused by a series of choices made through a complex interplay between three realms of activity: physical (the actions taken), cognitive (thoughts about the process and content) and affective (feelings experienced). According to Kuhlt-hau (1991, p.362) who builds upon MacMullin (1984) the choices made by the information seeker are also influenced by environmental constraints, such as prior experience, knowledge and interest, information available, requirements of the problem and time allotted for resolution. These environmental criteria, though, have not been considered in the ISP model.

According to Kuhlthau (1991, 1993) the six stages and their accompanying tasks 1. Initiation X  X  X ecognize information need. 2. Selection X  X  X dentify general topic. 3. Exploration X  X  X nvestigate information on general. 4. Formulation X  X  X ormulate focus. 5. Collection X  X  X ather information pertaining to focus. 6. Presentation X  X  X omplete.

In Fig. 1 , the relationships between the six stages of the ISP model as well as the interrelationships between the affective and cognitive experiences and physical actions are explicated.

The ISP model shows the information seeker  X  s constructive (learning) tasks and activities of finding meaning from information to extend his/her state of knowledge on a particular problem or topic. Accord-ing to Kuhlthau (1991) , the information seeking process is initiated by uncertainty resulting from a lack of understanding, a gap in meaning or a limited construction to solve a certain problem. This will change over time concurrently with the seeker getting information and constructing meaning to solve the problem.
During the initial stages of the information seeking process the information seeker is commonly feeling con-fused, frustrated and in doubt; in the final stages he or she is commonly satisfied, confident and relieved ( Kuhlthau, 1991, p. 366 ).  X  Formulation  X  represents the turning point of the ISP where feelings of uncertainty diminish and confidence increases. The task here is to form a focus from the information encountered. At this point and throughout the rest of the process, information seeking typically starts to decease whereas writing starts to increase, also signifying that the information seeker has started entering the  X  presentation  X  stage ( Kuhlthau, 1991, p. 368 ). At the presentation stage the task is to complete the search and prepare to present or otherwise use the information from the  X  collection  X  stage  X  . Feelings of relief are common with a sense of satisfaction if the search has gone well or disappointment if it has not. Further, as the knowledge state shifts to clearer, more focused thoughts about the topic or problem, a corresponding shift is typically noted in feelings of increased confidence and certainty.

Findings from Kuhlthau  X  s studies, also supported by Kracker (2002) and Kracker and Wang (2002) ; seem to confirm a correlation between the affective experiences and the cognitive activities of the model.
What the physical activities of the model is concerned, no strong correlation has been found between the information seeking activities and the cognitive and affective experiences.

Half of the participants in Kuhlthau  X  s studies did not reach a focused perspective of their topic at any time during the process. Although a significant change in thoughts was found ( Kuhlthau, 1991, p. 369 ), only 50% of the participants made focused statements of their topic at midpoint, and at closure, only 25% reported they were seeking information on a focused perspective. According to Kuhlthau (1991, p. 369) , this may lead to the assumption that many people may enter the presentation or writing phase without a clearly, focused topic.

In addition, it may also indicate that other factors, besides the learning and information seeking activi-ties, affect the information seeker  X  s emotional and cognitive experiences. The research interest in Kuhlthau  X  s studies has focused on the individual  X  s information seeking processes of constructing meaning that is the learning and search tasks of the individual. However, other tasks, such as the work task, may affect the process as well. In a review of studies on task-based information searching, Vakkari (2003, p. 414) distin-guishes between tasks as a process consisting of several stages and tasks as an apriori condition but left without any further characterization. In these cases, the point of departure is often searching, not the work task that has produced it. In the ISP model the task is conceptualised in terms of the learning and searching activities and processes involved when preparing a research proposal, which means that the focus of the model is on these subtasks, rather than the work task itself and the associated activities and processes.
When studying the information (seeking) behaviour of individuals acting as group members  X  , which is focus of the study reported here, the social dimension of the work task may also affect the individual group member and his or hers behaviour accordingly. 3. Previous work on Collaborative Information Behaviour (CIB)
Previous work on Collaborative Information Behaviour (CIB) is characterized by the importance of social factors to acquiring, retrieving, seeking, managing, sharing and generating information. Following from this, information behaviour is not restricted to information seeking (IS) and information retrieval (IR) activities only, but also defined in this paper to cover the broader set of activities (acquiring, managing, generating, etc.) X  X  X n line with Wilson (1999) , and Ingwersen and Ja  X  rvelin (2005) .

Though the research interest in the social dimension of information behaviour only in recent years has been reflected in the library and information science (LIS) literature, some common patterns of CIB can be stated.

In the LIS literature, collaboration in information seeking and retrieval has, until recently, been closely identified with the reference interview ( Proctor, Goldenberg, Davenport, &amp; McKinlay, 1998 ). Through a ser-ies of communicative interactions the requester and the librarian try to clarify what the requester is looking for and what the library has to offer in that regard. Recent studies of the collaborative aspects of information seeking and retrieval tend to focus on how technology may enable new forms of collaboration or provide referral services in new ways. The main foci of these studies are collaborative filtering (e.g., Goldberg, Nich-1999 ; Twidale, Nichols, &amp; Paice, 1997 ). While the studies investigated information transfer in collaborative settings, they rarely examined the process of information seeking. Moreover, some of these studies did not assume that the process of information seeking is carried out collectively . The most well known example of collaborative information seeking in this context is probably Allen  X  s (1977) description of the gatekeeper phenomenon. According to Allen (1977) a gatekeeper takes the responsibility to look for information and forward it to colleagues in his or her team or organization. In this way, the recipient of the information and the gatekeeper collaborate to find information that is useful to the work they are engaged in.
The few information-seeking studies that have provided empirical analyses of the involved collaboration include primarily the following studies. Common to most of these studies, all of longitudinal nature, is the focus on engineers  X  information-seeking behaviour. Moreover, the studies show how social and collabora-tive aspects as well as the work context may affect information behaviour and the problem solving process.
Further, the work task influences the participants (information seekers) involved, the information sources retrieved and used as well as the outcome of the problem solving process.

For example, Prekop (2002) explored the information-seeking behaviours of a military working group established to review the Australian Defence Force  X  s command and control capability. In this three-year project Prekop identified seven different information-related roles that were explicitly assigned to project participants or informally adopted by them. The mapping between roles and project participants was dy-namic and changed with the participants  X  workload and other responsibilities within the project as well as with the progress and staffing of the project.

Hertzum (2002) investigated how a group of software engineers assessed and chose their information sources. It turned out that whenever an engineer made a decision based on a given source the whole project became dependent on it. Consequently, discussion of sources became a recurrent issue at the project meet-ings. Indeed, one of the important roles of these meetings was to provide a forum for collaboratively reviewing the trustworthiness of sources that were being used or considered for use. Furthermore, it ap-peared to be a well-established conversational practice to accompany the mentioning of sources that might be new to some project participants with information that put these sources in context. Thereby otherwise unknown sources inherited an initial face and grounding from other people already known to the engineers.
Bruce et al. (2002) analysed two design teams during the initial stage of a software-engineering project and an aviation-engineering project. With respect to information seeking, collaboration took place when the engineers were identifying, analysing, and defining their information problems, as well as in devising strategies for information seeking. The act of retrieval itself was generally performed individually. Apart from this general pattern, the work context seemed to have a strong effect on the engineers  X  collaborative information-seeking behaviour. The engineers in the two projects differed in how they solved their informa-tion problems and in how they utilised each other and their project-external colleagues.

Sonnenwald and Pierce (2000) reported on a qualitative study exploring human information behaviour in a command and control military context. During data analysis, three important themes emerged, high-lighting the why, what, how and consequences of information behaviour. The first was the concept of  X  inter-woven situational awareness  X  consisting of individual, intragroup and intergroup-shared understanding of the situation. Situational awareness appeared to facilitate response to dynamic, constrain-bound situations.
The second theme described the need for  X  dense social networks  X  or frequent communication between par-ticipants about the work context and the situation. The third theme dealt with  X  contested collaboration  X  , the phenomenon where team members maintain an outward stance of cooperation, but work to further their own interests, some times destroying the collaborative effort.

Apart from these empirical studies, Karamuftuoglu (1998) has outlined a theoretical framework for understanding the collaborative nature of information seeking. The core of this framework is that informa-tion seeking is just as much about producing new knowledge, a creative and inventive activity, as it is about finding extant information. He addresses two knowledge functions of documentary IR, which systems should support: transferring knowledge and producing/creating new knowledge, where the last one is dependent on social networks and relations. This ties in with work on social intelligence ( Davenport, 2000 ) and with attempts to subsume support for information seeking in the broader area of group support ( Romano, Roussinov, Nunamaker, &amp; Chen, 1999 ).

As these previous studies and work on CIB reflect, social aspects affect information (seeking) behaviour in various ways. However, the focus has primarily been on the behaviour of engineers while the collabora-tive behaviour of students or researchers only seems to dominate studies of individuals  X  information behav-iour. Further, the behaviour studied has focused on the roles of group members and their motivations for either seeking, selecting, assessing or using information in specific ways in relation to a certain work task situation. The interplay between group members  X  activities and cognitive and affective experiences, as the
ISP model indicates, and how they may be affected by the work task as well as the group process, has not been investigated.

Thus, in order to explore and gain insight into these characteristics of group members  X  information behaviour and problem solving processes, a preliminary, qualitative case study was carried out exploring the ISP model in a group-based setting of students.

The research aim of the study is twofold, that is, to explore:  X  if group members behave differently from the individual modelled in the ISP; and further.  X  if intragroup members demonstrate different behaviours or they will assimilate and turn the group into
 X  an individual  X  , just in another sense. 4. Research design and methodology
The case study was carried out from April to May in 2002 and followed two groups of information sci-ence students during the process of making a term project assignment. During a five-week period each stu-dent of the two groups kept a diary of his or her activities and information-related behaviour. Each student was interviewed three times during the period with reference to his or her diary statements. In line with the previous studies of CIB, this study was also carried out on a longitudinal basis, meaning that the same per-son(s) was followed over time ( Wang, 1999 ). 4.1. Participants
The participants in the research study were five Danish graduate students in library and information sci-ence. They ranged from 25 to 31 years of age, three were female and two male. The students voluntarily formed a two-person group and a three-person group. The two male participants were in the three-person group. All participants were experienced information seekers and had previous experience with individual as well as group-based project assignments.
 4.2. Project assignment
The work task X  X  X he project assignment X  X  X as a mandatory part of a course on systems for document and knowledge management and lasted seven weeks. During this period the students had to formulate a project topic, find and digest relevant literature, collect and analyse data, devise a structure for presenting their argument, and write a project report. The project topics had to be within the broad area of knowledge and document management, but apart from that the students were free to formulate a project topic that was sufficiently narrow to fit the brief project period. The project reports approximate 25 pages for students working individually and 40 X 50 pages for groups of students. 4.3. Procedure
Three weeks prior to the start of the project assignment, eight students (three groups) received a brief description of the research study and an invitation to participate. The students were selected randomly from the students attending the course. All but one of the groups agreed to participate. The description of the research study emphasized that participation was voluntary and that participants were guaranteed anonymity. Furthermore, it described what participation would entail for the students: (1) answering a questionnaire addressing demographic, assignment-, group-and information-related issues; (2) keeping a diary of tasks and information-related activities performed during the project period; and (3) being interviewed two weeks into the project, in the middle of the project and when the project report had been completed and submitted. The description of the research study contained only little information about the specific research questions the study was set up to investigate. Because of the small number of par-ticipants, the case study is only preliminary in support of a larger study, which will be carried out in future.

The questionnaire ( Appendix A ) formed the basis of the first interview. Each participant was asked about her or his age, IT experience and previous experiences with both individual and group-based assignments.
Furthermore, each participant was asked to give a brief description of the project topic, which information sources had been used so far and for what reasons (e.g., for obtaining background information). Finally, each participant was asked to indicate his or her level of agreement on a 1-to-5 rating scale concerning a number of statements about information behaviour and feelings (e.g., whether he or she was feeling moti-vated, uncertain and frustrated).

The diary ( Fig. 2 a and b) consisted of a two-page diary form to be completed daily by each participant during a five-week period from the first to the third interview. As a surrogate for direct observation of the participants ( Wildemuth, 2002 ) the diary form recorded the participants  X  activities, individual views and information behaviour during their completion of the assignment. It combined primarily the diary log sheet used by Rieman to record activities on a daily basis ( Rieman, 1993 ) and Kuhlthau  X  s use of journals and process surveys ( Kuhlthau, 1993, p. 82 ) to record students  X  feelings, actions and experiences during the
ISP. Instead of recording activities and experiences at three points in their search (initiation, midpoint and closure) X  X  X s in the study by Kuhlthau (1993, p. 96)  X  X  X hey were recorded on a daily basis to reflect changes over time, and not only relating to search activities. As can be seen in Fig. 2 a the participants were asked to briefly describe each project or work task-related activity carried out during the day. This could for example be information activities such as  X  information searching  X  , report activities such as  X  writing on the introduction of my report  X  or communication activities such as  X  met with the group  X  . For each activity the participant should note what kind of information sources had been used, if any, and for how long. A source like  X  other persons  X  could for example be friends, family and supervisor.  X  RSLIS  X  refers to the Royal school of Library and Information Science and implied a physical visit to the library or the homepage. Besides the also be marked.  X  Other databases  X  beside Opacs could be articles found by searching electronic journals whereas  X  web-sites  X  could be web pages or documents found by searching the Internet.  X  Other sources  X  should be marked if none of the categories matched the source used by the participant.

Then each activity should be classified by the participant according to various predefined categories, such as  X  reading  X  ,  X  writing  X  , and  X  searching  X  , and the aim of the activity should be specified.
Finally, each participant was asked to indicate in the diary his or her perceived emotional state by assign-ing each of the feelings listed in Fig. 2b a number from 1 (low) to 5 (high), but only when recognized. These measures correspond to a large extent to Kuhlthau  X  s affective experiences explicated in the ISP model and also used in a process survey ( Kuhlthau, 1993, p. 97 ). However, some measures have been left out or added. reflect also the feelings associated with the research task which have been found in studies of students  X  behaviour when writing a research paper or proposal (e.g. Kracker, 2002 ; Kracker &amp; Wang, 2002 ;
Onwuegbuzie, 1997 ). For the same reason  X  anxiety  X  has been added to the ISP model.  X  Sense of direction  X  in the ISP model has been addressed in the interviews when the participants were asked to describe the focus of their assignment and further to elaborate on their affective experiences reported in the diaries.
Since a diary, according to Rieman (1993, p. 323) , may be a burden for the participants to keep (fill out and handle), the diary forms were administered electronically by the participants and returned to the author at the end of each week. The diary was in Danish but has been translated into English for the purpose of this paper.

Three semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant at selected stages in the lifecy-cle of the projects, resulting in a total of 15 interviews. Each interview lasted about 45 min and was recorded on tape. The interviews focused on the participants  X  current grasp on their projects, the activ-ities related to the assignment process, information-related activities performed and the participants  X  emotional experiences. For example, the participants were asked about what kind of information sources they had been searching for and why, their use of X  X  X nd reasons for using X  X  X nformation sources such as
 X  other group members  X  , digital libraries or their project supervisor. The interviews also concerned group-related issues, such as collaboration and role allocation. By interviewing the participants individually it became possible to explore whether and how group members differed in their perception of identical sit-uations and their information-related activities, and how these differences evolved over time. The first interview concerned the participants  X  goals, plans, thoughts, and feelings at the outset of their project.
The second and third interview unfolded around a walkthrough of the entries on the diary for the period since the last interview. Hence, the interviews became concrete, detailed, and focused on the participants  X  information-related behaviour and activities at a specific stage of their project to be compared at the end. Furthermore, this procedure served to clarify ambiguous diary entries and ensure appropriate use of the diaries, e.g., to stress the importance of recording activities on a continually basis to minimize the risk of collecting data based on memory or rationalizations made afterwards. In the third interview the participants were also encouraged to elaborate on the utility of group based work during the project assignment, and to comment on the use of the diary, that is, whether it had affected their way of work-ing. In addition, all interviews focused on the constructive part of the assignment process. For example, at each of the three interviews the participant was asked the same question:  X  X  X hat is your assignment about if I ask you today? X  X . In this way it was expected to see some change in focus formulation over time.

Two staff supervisors were assigned to the projects. After the reports were submitted, each supervisor was asked to indicate his or her perceived degree of focus of the reports with a number from 1 (weak) to 5 (strong). Following the studies made by Kuhlthau (1991, 1993) , a positive correlation between infor-mation seeking and meaning construction was expected to be reflected in a strong degree of focus. Since the participants were allowed to choose between two types of grade systems to be used for their assignment, using grades to measure the process against the outcome did not make sense. 4.4. Data analysis
The data were been analysed to describe the characteristics of group members  X  activities, their cognitive and affective experiences while doing an assignment and to see whether the behaviour of group members correspond to the behaviours explicated in the stages in the ISP-process model.

The constructive, cognitive part of the process is hard to measure, but according to Kuhlthau (1991, 1993) the participants  X  formulations can be used to estimate the impact of information seeking activities over time. In the light of this study, focus formulation was also expected to reflect the impact of social inter-actions, e.g., by resulting in a shared focus by the end of the process.

The questionnaire data for each participant were registered according to the questions and opinion state-ments appearing in Appendix A Further, summaries were generated, describing the project topic and the participants  X  motivations for either working alone or in groups.

The diary data for each participant were registered according to three categories:  X  activities  X  ,  X  information sources used  X  and  X  feelings  X  . The interview data were transcribed and analysed in support of the three cate-gories, but also to address the constructive aspect of the cognitive experiences. Due to technical problems during the first interview-session, the first five interviews are not covered by the transcriptions but have been summarised instead. In this paper, interview data are reported only in support of the questionnaire and the diary data. 4.5. Study limitations
During the interviews with the participants it became clear that the  X  aim of use  X  -designations in the diary were confusing and had been addressed by the participants with quite different meanings in mind. Conse-quently, these data have been left out of the analysis. Further, the time intervals used in the diary to let the participants express how long time they had spent on a certain information source according to a specific activity, did not provide useful information and have been left out of the analysis as well. 5. Findings and discussion
This section presents and discusses the findings of the study in relation to the three stages of the ISP model:  X  activities  X  ,  X  cognitive experiences  X  and  X  emotional experiences  X  and further, in accordance with the of the assignment period. When referring to  X  group A  X  , it refers to the group consisting of one female (A1) and two male (A2 and A3) and  X  group B  X  refers to the female-group (B1 and B2). Participant quota-tions have been translated into English by the author. 5.1. Activities during the project
Various activities associated with the task of writing an assignment were recorded by the participants. As an example, Figs. 3 and 4 show the number and variation of work task-related activities such as  X  searching  X  ,
 X  writing  X  and  X  reading  X  throughout the period, here reported by groups A and B and categorised according to the labels in the diary. The X -axis shows the dates for which these three activities have been recorded by the participants in the diary, meaning that  X  empty days  X  either did not involve  X  searching  X  etc. or that no project task related activity had taking place on that specific day. The Y -axis shows the number of activities recorded by the group members during a day. Some activities recorded separately were categorised by the same label, e.g.  X  searching  X  , which also explains why some of the patterned columns extent the number of group members.

As the figures show, there is a trend that reading and writing, in particular, increased while searching decreased during the process.  X  Information searching  X  generally took place in the beginning of the period (topic selection and prefocus exploration) and in the middle of the period (focus formulation) with the aim of finding background and relevant information. This was further explicated in the interviews. When searching information at the end of the project, the aim was generally to verify references. In few cases the aim was to check if relevant information had been missed that had to be taken into account. Informa-tion searching was done on an individual basis, meaning that group members did not search informa-tion together. The strategies for seeking information differed between the participants and between intragroup members as well, for example, as demonstrated in their preferences for specific information sources. Table 1 shows the group members  X  perceived usefulness scores from 1 to 5 of various information sources in the beginning of the project. The bolded entries in the table show the diversity among intragroup members of the perceived importance of information sources at the beginning of the project. As can be no-ticed, the preferred information source(s) differed among intragroup members, indicating that the group members had different ways of seeking and getting information, also under influence of their project context.

In the diaries and the interviews,  X  printed sources  X  and  X  social sources  X  , such as  X  group members  X  , were often mentioned in relation to three activities which took place throughout the process:  X  reading  X  ,  X  writing  X  and  X  communication with group member(s)  X  .

Initially,  X  reading  X  was often associated with the aim of  X  getting new knowledge  X  , while in the end it was more often associated with  X  checking  X  and  X  controlling  X  as a part of the writing process. In the same way  X  communication with group member(s)  X  varied according to the progress of the assignment. At the beginning the aim was to discuss and clarify the focus, while at the end the aim was to write the assignment with completion in mind. Accordingly, group communication formed part of the constructive and cognitive process of the project assignment, which is further addressed in 5.2. As indicated above, it appeared that
 X  writing  X  took place almost from the beginning of the assignment period before forming a focus, while in the ISP model this activity commonly is associated with the presentation stage (after the focus formulation).
Many of the participants explained during the first interviews that having started to write meant having started the project. In this way, writing formed part of both the constructive process of forming a focus and served as indication of how well the project was progressing. This also turned out to affect the emo-tional experiences in terms of stress and uncertainty as the deadline approached. Bystro  X  m and Jarvelin (1995) have also demonstrated the effect of task on information behaviour. For example, in their study on the dynamics of task types and information seeking and use they found that work task complexity and affective experiences seem to be interrelated. In complex tasks, negative feelings are often arising (from the task) and thus become an integrated part that might have an overall effect on performance. This issue will be further addressed in Section 5.3. 5.2. Cognitive experiences during the project
Based on the questionnaire and interview data as well as the supervisors  X  feedback on the assignment foci after the assignments were handed in, the group members  X  formulation of subject and problem area to some extent followed the cognitive and constructive pattern in the ISP model. This means that the group mem-ber  X  s formulation during the three interviews changed from weak in the beginning of the project to more focused at the end, which further was characterized by a shared intragroup understanding of the focus. Based on the feedback from the supervisors, the assignment of group A was assigned a focus degree of  X  4  X  (1 = weak and 5 = strong) and group B was assigned a  X  3  X  .

Except for one, none of the participants agreed to have a clear focus of the project at the beginning of the project. In addition, the perceived degree of understanding of the focus varied between the group-members, which stresses the importance of good group communication and discussion as a part of the constructive process. Besides that group communication formed part of the constructive and cognitive process of the project assignment, each group member also acted as an information source during this process. Through group meetings and email-communication, for example, information was exchanged either as concrete ref-erences or as documented comments and suggestions to a group member  X  s written manuscript. This was also a way to ensure or provide for a shared understanding of the project focus. This use of social sources is also in line with previous CIB-studies (e.g. Hertzum, 2000 ; Sonnenwald, 1999 ; Sonnenwald &amp; Pierce, 2000 ).

Other intragroup issues turned out to affect the cognitive process as well. During the first interview it became clear that group A had intragroup problems. Each of the group members experienced difficulties in reaching a consensus on the project focus and found that the other group members had a different ap-proach to the task. The fact that none of the members knew each other very well also seemed to play a considerable role in this context. Group B, in contrast, knew each other from the outset and did not expe-rience any kind of these problems. Further, these intragroup problems affected the group members  X  emo-tional experiences negatively, which is further discussed in the next section. 5.3. Affective experiences during the project
Based on the diary data and the interviews, various emotional feelings were experienced during the pro-ject assignment process, varying among intragroup members both in occurrence and in strength.
When, at the beginning of the study, the participants were asked to explain their motivations for working in a group, their motivations were, not surprisingly, associated with social aspects. This was reflected in statements such as:  X  X  X wo people are twice as good X  X ,  X  X  X   X  m feeling enriched by talking to other people about various subjects X  X ,  X  X  X   X  m feeling frustrated by not having other students to discuss with X  X  or  X  X  X  want to com-pare my level of competence with other students X  X .

However, when asked about their motivations for working with the assignment project, their answers differed significantly which is depicted in Fig. 5 .

According to Bystro  X  m and Jarvelin (1995) , personal factors such as attitude, motivation and mood come into play when the information seeker is confronted with a complex task. In the same way, the diversity in motivations experienced by the group members could be expected to affect the intragroup process. It may, for example, to some extent explain the group members  X  different agreements to the perception of uncer-tainty and frustration at the beginning of the study. This is shown in Fig. 6 .

As indicated, low to middle motivation (scores = 1 X 3) in Fig. 5 seemed to be associated with middle to high uncertainty (scores = 3 X 5) in Fig. 6 . As stated above, group A was having intragroup problems and experienced difficulties in reaching a consensus on the project focus and the approach to the task.
Further, the fact that none of the A-members knew each other very well also seemed to play a con-siderable role in this context. It may thus explain the frustration and uncertainty values assigned by A2 at the beginning of the study. According to Sorrentino and Roney (2000) uncertainty and its resolution plays a central role in theories discussing interpersonal, group and intragroup relations.
Building upon theorists in this field (e.g. Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975 ; Brewer &amp; Harasty, 1996 ) they state that the entire goal of interpersonal communication is to reduce uncertainty about the message being conveyed and about the relations between the communicators. Further, uncertainty reduction is a ma-jor force behind the need for feelings of group belongingness. The uncertainty experienced by group member B1 was found to be associated with a perceived  X  X  ... lack of control, confidence and owner-ship of the assignment X  X . This was partly due to a weak idea of the project goal and focus and partly due to a frustration caused by a feeling of not being in full control of the project and the end prod-uct. Besides the cognitive factors, reflected in a weak perception of focus at the beginning of the pro-ject, social factors were also found to have an impact on the group members  X  emotional experiences. In addition, these emotional experiences feelings seemed to react on the cognitive process towards a shared focus formulation.

The interplay between work task, intragroup processes and emotional feelings was demonstrated throughout the process.

Figs. 7 X 17 show the group members  X  emotional experiences of negative feelings (uncertainty, frustration and disappointment) and positive feelings (clarity, optimism and relief) during the process, which is indi-cated by a number from 1 (low) to 5 (high). The figures should not be read as the progress of one specific feeling as experienced by a group member or as a sum of that specific feeling by which the average can be stated; corresponding to Kuhlthau  X  s studies, the figures signify a group member  X  s identification and expe-rience of a specific feeling at a certain point in the process. Thus,  X  blank days  X  in the figures means that no such feeling had been recognized by the group member (except for the days where a group member did not fill out the diary). There is no figure showing the disappointment of group B, since no disappointment was recognized by the group members.

As Figs. 7 X 9 and Figs. 13 and 14 demonstrate, negative feelings did not only occur in the beginning of the project. Also in the middle and at the end of the project feelings such as uncertainty, frustration and disappointment occurred.
 Regarding group A, the uncertainty experienced by group member A1 and A2 seem to increase, whereas
A3 only seldom seem to recognize that feeling. This is also true regarding the experience of frustration and disappointment, though it is perceived differently by A1 and A2 according to the process. Group member
A1 primarily felt frustrated and disappointed towards the end of the assignment, which was found to be associated with an intragroup mis-match of motivations and ambitions. Regarding A2 the experience of frustration and disappointment, primarily in the beginning and in the middle of the process, was found to be associated with the previous mentioned intragroup problems. Group member A3 did not recognize any of these feelings at any time; he generally felt optimistic and did not seem to be emotionally affected by the intragroup problems.

This is also reflected in Figs. 10 X 12 showing the positive feelings as experienced by group A during the process. As can be noticed in Fig. 11 , optimism increased concerning A2 and A3, whereas the optimism regarding A1 decreased, which corresponds to her increase in frustration and disappointment as stated ear-lier. This may also explain her experience of clarity as shown in Fig. 10 , which only was recognized in the beginning and in the middle of the project. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 12 , only A1 experienced a relief towards the end of the project, which was explained to relate to the finish of the project, whereas A2 pri-marily felt relieved in the beginning and in the middle of the project. According to the figure, A3 only felt relieved a few times, which may be associated with his very few experiences of uncertainty and no experi-ence of frustration and disappointment.

Regarding group B, uncertainty as demonstrated in Fig. 13 diminished while frustration concerning B1 increased, which is shown in Fig. 14 .

This was explained in the last interview to relate to the previous mentioned frustration of not being in full control of the end product and the result of the process. In comparison, no frustration was perceived by
B2. She generally felt optimistic and in control with the assignment and further, was very happy about the group work throughout the project. This is also reflected in Fig. 15 X 17 , showing group B  X  s recognition of positive feelings during the project. As can be noticed, B2 generally assigned a medium score to her expe-rience of optimism, clarity and relief, which she explained in the interviews denoted her generally positive experience of the project. Regarding B1, clarity and optimism increased which seemed to happen as uncer-tainty diminished, in accordance with the ISP model. In contrast to B2, no recognition of relief was expe-rienced by B1 at any time.

Although the individual group-members  X  focus formulation became clearer during the process, also resulting in positive feelings as the ISP model prescribes, it became evident in the last interview that intragroup aspects demonstrated as a divergence in motivations and ambitions between group members had contributed to the negative feelings such as frustration and disappointment. When  X  uncertainty  X  was experienced at the end of the project it seemed to be associated with the quality of the product (the assignment). Hence, also the nature of the work task turned out to have an impact on the feelings expe-rienced by the group members. For instance, lack of time was often mentioned as an explanation for noting  X  stress  X  as an  X  other  X  feeling in the diary. Accordingly, a noted  X  relief  X  in the diary at the end of the project was often explained in the last interview by statements such as  X  X  X nd of stress X  X  and  X  X  X nd of pressure X  X  and not solely by cognitive factors in response to gained clarity and focus formulation, as the ISP model states. These findings correspond well to the findings made by Kracker and Wang (2002) in their study of students  X  anxiety and perceptions of research.  X  Research anxiety  X  was here found to be more than library anxiety; students could relate anxiety to starting research, collecting information, and writing and overall aspects such as time management. Further,  X  relief  X  was also found in their study to be associated with the research task, that is, the accomplishment of the assignment ( Kracker &amp; Wang, 2002, p. 298 ). Anxiety arising from writing a research proposal was also found by Onwuegbuzie (1997) .
In a study involving 81 graduate students preparing a research proposal he identified four task-related anxieties, which were associated with the library, statistics, composition and the research process. The effect of high scores in anxiety was to some extent noticed in low scores in the research proposals. In addition, anxiety arising from writing the research proposal affected the students  X  performance and prob-lem solving. 5.4. Summary of results
Based on the findings presented in the previous sections, the information seeking process may not al-ways result in positive affective experiences proportional to the process of cognition, simply because other work task or group-related factors are at play too and intermingle with the perceptions of emotions of the group members. Thus, compared to the individual  X  s experiences in ISP model, the negative feelings did not diminish as the project focus became clearer and the group members stopped searching for relevant infor-mation. In addition, the negative feelings were not replaced by positive feelings such as clarity, also men-tioned by Kuhlthau as the  X  turning point  X  . Further, the mandatory deadline of the project did not match the level of ambition and sense of  X  project finish  X  or  X  closure  X  of most of the group members. The impact of group processes on the project assignment process were further demonstrated during the last interview.
All group members except for one said they would prefer to continue on an individual basis if they had the chance to correct parts of the project. One might argue then that to some group members, the only stage reached was the Kuhlthau stage 3 (  X  frustration/doubt  X  , prior to a narrower focus formulation and  X  clarity  X  ) as perceived by them . Though a clearer focus (in their writing) was detected towards the end, they did not feel it that way. Regarding the intragroup behaviour, the group members applied different information seeking strategies and further, the feelings experienced by each group member varied during the project assignment, both in type and strength. Hence, though social and collaborative factors were found to affect the group members  X  cognitive and affective experiences, group members still perceived and acted on an individual basis. 6. Conclusion
This paper has reported the findings of a qualitative longitudinal case study exploring Kuhlthau  X  s ISP model used in a group-based setting of students. The aim of the study was to contribute to our understand-ing of the impact of socially determined work task activities on information (seeking) behaviour as expe-rienced by group members in a collaborative setting. Though only preliminary in its form, some findings can be stated that should be further explored.

Besides information seeking activities, also variables imbedded in work task-related and social (intra and extra group) activities seem to dynamically affect the outcome of the process, both cognitively and emotionally.

Different intragroup preferences concerning information sources were observed which seemed to affect the goal of reaching a shared understanding of the focus and project goal. Further, the intragroup diver-gence in foci, motivations and ambitions turned out to have an impact on feelings such as uncertainty, frustration and disappointment. Though the information seeking process had stopped (Kuhlthau  X  s stage six), generally expected to imply relief and satisfaction according to the ISP model, some of the group members still felt uncertain and frustrated at the end of the project. This may indicate that the partic-ipants did not go through all the stages of the ISP model. Taken into consideration that the group members in this study turned out to have very different affective experiences during the project, some of which were socially determined, it may be hypothesized that the work task and its effect on students performance is even more complicated when the task is solved in a group-based setting.

The result of the study leads to the following conclusion:  X  Based on the group members  X  focus formulation in the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the process, they did to some extent demonstrate similar cognitive experiences as those pre-sented in the ISP model. However, this formulation was not only based on information searching but also based on activities such as social interaction during group work, reading and writing. In addition, cognitive experiences also seemed to interact with the group members  X  emotional experiences.  X  Group members did not perceive similar emotional experiences as the individual information seeker pre-sented in the ISP model; uncertainty and disappointment was still perceived by some group members at the end of the project period, which might imply that only the emotional stage three in the ISP model was reached. This was to some extent related to both social and task-based factors resulting from an intragroup mismatch regarding motivations, ambitions and project foci. Finally, group members did not demonstrate similar intragroup characteristics and behaviours during the process and thus cannot be regarded as  X  an individual  X  , just in another sense.

As this study suggests, a natural extension of the ISP model would be to address also the impact of con-textual and social factors, such as the work task and socio-psychological intragroup issues, when studying individuals  X  physical activities and cognitive and emotional experiences in a group-based setting.
To gain insight into the complexity of group-based information behaviour, the dynamics of work task factors as well as collaborative and social factors in relation to group members  X  information behaviour should be further explored.
