 Nowadays, many companies deploy social media technolo-gies to foster the knowledge transfer in the enterprise. As the amount of available content in such systems grows, there is an increasing need for recommender systems that pro-vide recommendations according to the knowledge workers X  needs and preferences. We propose a topic-based recom-mender system for Enterprise 2.0 resource sharing platform s. The system identifies the knowledge workers X  short-term and long-term topics of interest by applying algorithms from th e domain of topic detection and tracking and generates rec-ommendations with a high degree of inter-topic diversity.

Companies increasingly often deploy social media tech-nologies such as blogs, wikis, and resource sharing platfor ms to foster the knowledge transfer between employees. In 2006 McAffee ([6]) coined the term Enterprise 2.0 under which he subsumed a collection of Web 2.0 technologies for gener-ating, sharing, and refining information. Companies should buy or build these technologies in order to uncover the prac-tices and outputs of their knowledge workers.
 We tackle the problem of providing recommendations in Enterprise 2.0 platforms according to the knowledge work-ers X  different topics of interest. Using traditional collab o-rative filtering (CF) algorithms in such systems is difficult as the amount of items is usually large whereas the number of users is comparatively small. In such settings CF sys-tems suffer from sparsity problems: First it is difficult to find peers from which recommendations can be generated. Second many resources may not be rated thus it will not be possible to recommend them. Further traditional rec-ommender systems tend to recommend items with similar content. In [11] Ziegler et al. show that beyond pure accu-racy, diversity in recommendations plays an important role to increase the user satisfaction with a recommender system .
In the thesis we aim at building a topic-based recom-mender system that takes the knowledge workers X  differ-ent topics of interest into account. E. g., a software engi-neer might be interested in the Java programming language, Linux operating systems, and punk rock music. She uses an Enterprise 2.0 resource sharing platform to exchange con-tents according to these interest topics with her colleague s. Our approach applies algorithms from the domain of topic detection and tracking ([1]) to identify the knowledge work -ers X  short-term and long-term interest topics. On this basi s we aim at providing topic-based recommendations that meet the users X  needs and preferences.
An early recommender system that takes the users X  differ-ent topics of interest into account was the Fab system, pro-posed by Balabanovi  X c and Shoham ([2]). Fab is a distributed content-based, collaborative recommender system. The rec -ommendation process is divided into two stages: First is the collection of items from the web according to different in-terest topics. For each topic a collection agent exists that maintains a content-based profile thus allowing it to gather relevant pages for the respective topic. The topics are com-puter generated clusters of interests that track the changi ng preferences of the user population. Second is the selection stage. For each user an individual selection agent maintain s a content-based user profile that way allowing the delivery of pages gathered from the collection agents according to the user X  X  preferences. In Fab the users provide feedback fo r resources by explicit ratings. The users X  ratings are store d in each user X  X  individual selection agent and are forwarded to the respective collection agents. The collection agents then adapt their profiles accordingly. Pages that have been rated highly by a user are recommended to other users with similar profiles.

A user modeling approach that takes a user X  X  different topics of interest into account is presented in [8]. Middlet on et al. describe the Quickstep recommender system which unobtrusively monitors the browsing behavior of its users. The target users of the system are scientists that need to be informed about new papers in their field of interest as well as older papers relating to their work. The system ap-plies supervised machine-learning coupled with an ontolog i-cal representation of topics to elicit user preferences. It uses a multi-class behavioral model with classes representing p a-per topics that way allowing domain knowledge to be used when the user profile is constructed. The system works as follows: User browsing behavior is monitored unobtrusivel y via a proxy server that logs every URL browsed during the user X  X  working activity. Overnight, a machine-learning al go-rithm classifies browsed URLs and saves the classified papers in a paper store. The interest profile is derived from explici t feedback and browsed topics. Recommendations are com-puted based on the user X  X  current topics of interest and the classified paper topics. The generated recommendation list s contain items from the user X  X  three most current topics of interest. veloped at the Knowledge Management department of the It enables the knowledge workers to share bookmarks and all kinds of files (images, audio, video, office documents, etc.). ALOE provides tagging, commenting, and rating function-alities. In order to make resources easily retrievable they are annotated with metadata by the community of users. Whenever users add resources to their portfolio they have to annotate a title and tags. Optionally a description, author , and licensing information may also be added. The ALOE platform fulfills our requirements as it allows the knowledg e workers to share content according to their different topics of interest.
We aim at providing recommendations from a user X  X  short-term and long-term topics of interest. Section 4.1 describe s the extraction of a user X  X  current topics of interest and Sec -tion 4.2 depicts how reoccurring long-term topics are iden-tified.
We identify the knowledge workers X  topics of interest by applying textual data mining techniques on the metadata profiles of her preferred resources in ALOE. A resource is considered as preferred when a user has contributed it to the system, added it to her portfolio or has given it a pos-itive rating (i. e., a rating value bigger than three on a five point rating scale). For these resources, metadata profiles are composed which are worked up and then fed to a clus-tering algorithm. The process steps of our topic extraction algorithm are depicted in Figure 1 and will be described in detail subsequently: http://aloe-project.de/ http://www.dfki.de/
Data Access: We determine all resources for which a user has expressed a preference since the last time her short-ter m interests have been extracted. For each of these resources a metadata profile consisting of the annotated titles and the tags is composed. Per resource potentially many titles are available as every user that adds the resource to her portfo-lio has to provide a title. Experiments have been conducted that also included the descriptions of the resources. How-ever the best clustering results were achieved when only the titles and the tags of the resources were used.
 Preprocessing: We convert the terms contained in the meta-data profiles to lower case characters, remove punctuation characters and stop words. Further stemming is applied to bring the terms to a normalized form. We use the Snowball resources are represented according to the  X  X ag-of-words X  model, i. e., they are represented as vectors where the fea-tures correspond to the terms in the corpus (i. e., the cur-rently considered set of the user X  X  preferred resources) an d the feature values are the counts of the words in the respec-tive metadata profiles.
 Noise Reduction: Very rare and very frequent terms are not considered helpful to characterize resources. As a con-sequence dimensions representing these terms are removed. Term Weighting: Terms that appear frequently in the meta-data profile of one resource but rarely in the whole corpus are likely to be good discriminators and should therefore obtain a higher weight. We use the TF-IDF measure ([4]) which is widely applied in information retrieval systems in order to achieve this goal.
 Clustering and Cluster Labeling: To be able to cluster the set of a user X  X  preferred resources we need to find a reason-able number of clusters in our data first. For this purpose we follow an approach which is based on the residual sum of squares (RSS) in a clustering result (see [5], page 365). For document clustering and cluster label extraction we apply non-negative matrix factorization. Using non-negative ma -trix factorization (NMF) for document clustering has firstl y been introduced by Xu et al. ([10]). NMF finds the posi-tive factorization of a given positive matrix. It is applied on the term-document matrix representation of the document corpus. In the latent semantic space which is derived by http://snowball.tartarus.org/ Figure 2: Profile that represents a user X  X  different topics of interest by weighted term vectors. applying NMF, each axis represents the base topic of a doc-ument cluster. Every document is represented as an additive combination of these base topics. Associating a document with a cluster is done by choosing the base topic (axis) that has the highest projection value with the document. For cluster labeling we simply choose for each cluster the ten terms with the highest degree of affiliation. Terms with a relevance value of less than 25% of that of the most relevant term in the cluster are discarded. For every user interest we obtain a weighted term vector whose terms characterize the respective topic. An example of a user profile consisting of many such topics is depicted in Figure 2.
The identification of a user X  X  current topics of interest as described in Section 4.1 is executed in regular time interva ls (currently once every week). In order to identify similar topics of interest between different runs we follow an easy and straightforward topic tracking approach that works as follows:
In our first experiments we found that this simple method meets our requirements. However the integration of more our future work.
The extraction of a user X  X  topics of interest requires a crit -ical amount of data about the user (i. e., expressed item pref -erences). However we want to generate useful recommenda-tions also for users that are new to the system. For that purpose we propose a switching hybrid recommender sys-tem that generates traditional item-based collaborative fil-tering (CF) recommendations (e. g., [9]) for users for which that is directly integrated into the NMF method. no interest topics have been identified so far. Users that have interacted with the system over a longer period of time will get recommendations according to their short-term and long-term topics of interest. To be able to generate instant recommendations for a potentially large amount of users, the recommendation generation process is split into an of-fline and an online phase.
 Offline analysis: In the offline analysis we calculate the similarities between all recommendable items in the ALOE system according to the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm. That way we can provide item-based CF rec-ommendations for users for which no interest topics have been identified so far. Further we extract the short-term and long-term interest topics of those users that have ex-pressed preferences for a critical amount of items since the ir last interests identification run.
 Online recommendation generation: In the online phase two use cases have to be distinguished. In the first case no topic vectors are available for the active user, yet. In this case our system tries to generate recommendations according to the item-based CF method. In the second case user inter-est topics are available. In this case our system calculates topic-based recommendations as follows: 1. Selecting topics for recommendations: Whenever top-2. Obtaining topic resources: After having selected the 3. Composing the recommendation list: The list should
As there is only a small amount of users contributing re-sources to the ALOE system regularly, we are still missing an extensive evaluation scenario. We have conducted a first evaluation of our short-term user interests identification ap-proach as presented in Section 4.1. For that purpose we selected eight users that expressed preferences for at leas t twenty resources in the system. A questionnaire was sent to these users showing the terms which represented their iden-tified topics of interest. For each of these topics the users had to answer three questions: http://lucene.apache.org/ Table 1: Results of the preliminary evaluation study. User detected correct recommendations Sum 39 32 27 Q1: Has the topic of interest correctly been detected? Q2: How would you describe the topic in your own words? Q3: Would you like to get recommendations for the topic?
Table 1 shows for each user, how many topics were iden-tified by the system, how many of them were classified as correctly identified by the user and for how many of these topics the user would appreciate recommendations. Alto-gether 39 user interest topics have been identified. 32 of the topics were classified as correct by the users. For 27 topics the users said that they would appreciate resource recommendations. Each user in average classified 84.17% of her identified topics as correct. User C is an outlier, only one of three identified topics has been classified as correctl y identified.

As stated in [7] it is not enough to evaluate recommender systems only according to the accuracy of rating prediction s. The goal for the evaluation of our system is to measure the perceived topic diversification and user satisfaction with the topic-based recommendations. The users should judge three different kinds of recommendation lists according to these criteria: the best rated resources in the system, item-base d collaborative filtering recommendations, and recommenda-tions from our topic-based approach. The evaluation will be performed as soon as we have a critical amount of users to achieve statistically significant results.
In this paper we presented an approach providing resource recommendations with a high degree of inter-topic diversit y in Enterprise 2.0 resource sharing platforms. The method applies algorithms from the domain of topic detection and tracking to extract the users X  short-term and long-term top -ics of interest. A preliminary evaluation experiment has shown that the users were able to associate the topic la-bels with their real topics of interest thus showing that the method is likely to capture reasonable user interest topics . Also the users widely agreed that they would appreciate re-source recommendations for the identified topics.
In our future work we aim at improving the algorithms to detect the users X  long-term topics of interest and we will evaluate the perceived topic diversity as well as the user satisfaction with the system.
