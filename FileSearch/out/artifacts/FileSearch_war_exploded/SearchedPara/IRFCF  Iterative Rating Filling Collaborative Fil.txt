 With the rapid development of World Wide Web and e-commerce, recommendation trieval. And collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most promising recommendation historic rating information of other users whose interest is similar with active user. In ory-based algorithms and model-based algorithms. 
Because of the tremendous growth of customers and commodities in e-commerce, the problems of sparsity and scalability have become key challenges for collaborative filtering, which seriously impact the quality of present CF methods. To deal with the sparsity problem, Some work have been proposed, such as: Singular Value Decompo-sition (SVD), Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Latent Semantic Index-ing(LSI),content-boosted CF approaches and item-based approach [2]. Furthermore, some researchers tried to solve the problem from other perspectives: J.Wan proposed ReCoM [3] algorithm using multi-type relationships to improve the cluster quality of scalability problems from a new perspective. To address above problems, this paper presents a novel approach X  X terative Rating ment process, object-pair similarity is co mputed, and average rating and rating range are introduced to normalize ratings in order to alleviate rating bias problem. Then we and item clusters. Finally, the nearest neighbors in the set of top clusters are selected to generate predictions for active user. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents brief description of related work. In Section 3, Iterative Rating Filling Collaborative filtering algorithm is formally illustrated. The results of experiment are presented in Section 4, followed by conclusion in Section 5. improve the cluster quality, which can effectively alleviate the problem sparsity. The main similarity equation was defined as follows: 
G.R. Xue [4] combines the advantages of these two approaches by introducing a the basis for data smoothing and neighborhood selection. The missing-value was smoothed as: average rating for all the users in cluster C u . 3.1 Iterative Similarity Calculating and Rating Normalization G. Jeh proposed SimRank algorithm [5] to measured similarity by Iterative analyzing research. In SimRank, all relationships between heterogeneous objects were regarded as 0/1 binary, but they are variants in CF. Furthermore, this paper introduces average rating and rating range to normalize ratings in order to alleviate rating bias [6]. Taking them into account, this paper firstly extend SimRank similarity equation as follows: average values for object O x . stands the rating range of object X. At the beginning O 3.2 Iterative Filling Missing Ratings doesn X  X  mean that users don X  X  like these items, and doesn X  X  indicate their interests are become a main factor that causes sparsity and interferes seriously with the quality of the collaborative filtering. u
Meanwhile, considering that our approach analyze from the interrelationships be-tween heterogeneous objects, it is feasible to fill the missing ratings from the aspect of tion through iterative reinforcement processing: R tively. 3.3 Cluster-Based Iterative Missing Rating Filling similarity calculation. In each iteration step, information of all uses and items are used to fill missing ratings. But factually, it is not necessary at all and could not reach the optimization. R item i a . The cluster-based missing rating filling equation is expressed as: Where n times iteration and is the average rating for all the users in cluster C x . 3.4 Nearest Neighbor Selectio n and Prediction Recommendation neighbors for test user to predict. Considering that above cluster-based iterative filling test user. with test user. The similarity between clusters and test user can be calculated as: following similarity function: 
Finally, after the Top N most similar user s are selected, we can conduct prediction deviation from neighbors X  mean: is the number of users in the neighborhood. 4.1 Dataset and Evaluation Metric MR_100, MR_200, and MR_300, respectively. Then we use the last 200 users for testing. The evaluation metric used in our experiments was the commonly used mean ratings from the actual ratings on items the test users have voted. 4.2 Performance In order to evaluate the performance of our cluster-based iterative filling approach, we compare our algorithm-iterative rating filling collaborative filtering (IRFCF) with the state-of-art algorithms for collaborative filt ering: the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) method, the Personality Diagnosis (PD), the Aspect Model (AM), the Flexible Mixture Mode(FMM) and the iterative similarity computing collaborative filtering (ICF). Table 1 summarizes the results for these six methods. Clearly, the algorithm missing data based on mutual relationship reinforcement between users and items, our number of nearest number is set to 20. based iterative similarity computation. Experiment results show that our approach can significantly improve accuracy of prediction. Acknowledgements. This work was funded by the Natural Science Fund of Jiangsu Province(No.BK2005046).
