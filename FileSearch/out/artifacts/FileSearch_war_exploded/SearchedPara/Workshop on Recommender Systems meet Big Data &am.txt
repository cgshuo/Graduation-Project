 The primary goal of the workshop is to showcase cutting edge research on the intersection of Recommender Systems and Semantic Technologies, by taking the best of the two worlds. This combination may provide the RecSys com-munity with important scenarios where the potential of Se-mantic Technologies can be e ectively exploited into systems performing complex tasks, such as recommendation engines processing Big Data.

Recommendation techniques generally rely on data refer-ring to three types of objects: users, items and their rela-tions . The widespread success of Semantic Web techniques, creating a Web of interoperable services and machine read-able data [3], o ers novel strategies to represent data that might improve the current state of the art of recommender systems, in order to move towards a new generation of rec-ommender systems which fully understand the items they deal with [7, 4, 5].

Indeed, more and more semantic data are published fol-lowing the Linked Data principles, that enable to set up links between objects in di erent data sources by connecting in-formation in a single global data space -the Web of Data. Today, the Web of Data includes di erent types of knowl-edge represented in a homogeneous form -sedimentary one (encyclopedic, cultural, linguistic, common-sense) and real-time one (news, data streams). This data might be useful to interlink diverse information about users [1, 2], items, and their relations, as well as to implement reasoning mecha-nisms that can support and improve the recommendation process [10, 9].

The challenge is to investigate whether and how this large amount of wide-coverage and linked semantic knowledge can signi cantly improve complex search and ltering tasks that cannot be merely solved through a straightforward match-ing of queries (or user pro les) and items [6, 8]. Such tasks involve nding information from large document collections, categorizing and understanding that information, and pro-ducing some output, such as an actionable decision. Exam-ples of such tasks include understanding a health problem in order to make a medical decision, or simply deciding which laptop to buy. Recommender systems support users exactly in those complex tasks.

The main aim of the workshop is to open a discussion on the following topics: Recommendation approaches exploiting Big Data, Linked Data and Semantic Technologies; Ontology-based recommendation algorithms; Reasoning with Big Data;
Discovery of relevant Linked Data sources for recom-mendation algorithms; Linking, aggregating, intertwining and mining Linked
