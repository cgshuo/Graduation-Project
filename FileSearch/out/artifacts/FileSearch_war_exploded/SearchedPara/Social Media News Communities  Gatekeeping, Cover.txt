 We examine biases in online news sources and social me-dia communities around them. To that end, we introduce unsupervised methods considering three types of biases: se-lection or  X  X atekeeping X  bias, coverage bias, and statement bias, characterizing each one through a series of metrics. Our results, obtained by analyzing 80 international news sources during a two-week period, show that biases are sub-tle but observable, and follow geographical boundaries more closely than political ones. We also demonstrate how these biases are to some extent amplified by social media. H.1.2 [ User/Machine Systems ]: Human information pro-cessing Measurement, Human Factors Online News, Framing, News Bias
What is published by the news media depends on numer-ous factors, an important one being the newsworthiness of a story, but also factors such a space constraint, timeliness, and how close a story is to readers in a geographical and cul-tural sense [7]. Since it is impossible to report everything, selectivity is inevitable. Nonetheless, reputable news media are expected to be objective in which stories they report and how they report them; their role is to inform people about what is happening either locally, nationally or worldwide. It is however known that media bias exists. For instance, Fox News has been formally accused of misrepresenting facts in an effort to appeal to conservative viewers. 1 Exposure to biases in news reporting has numerous consequences. It has been shown to have the capability to foster intolerance as well as ideological segregation, and even antagonisms in major political and social issues [8]. Bias can also affect voting behavior, depending on the degree and direction of it, and on voters X  reliance on media [6, 10]. Being aware, tracking, and overcoming bias in news reporting is important for a fair society, as media indeed has the power to shape a democratic society.

Twitter is a major component of the online news ecosys-tem. Once passive, users consuming news online filter news and discuss what media publish on Twitter. Social media can play a major role in terms of overcoming biases, since social media users can freely (in principle) report on current events showing other angles of a story, and also help us un-derstand the presence of bias in the news online ecosystem. In this paper, we focus on the latter.

Bias can happen in a number of ways [19]: which stories are selected, selection bias, how much attention is given to a story, coverage bias , and how a story is reported, statement bias . We analyze data from dozens of international news media organizations to answer how can we quantify biases in online news? Naturally, we do not expect that media bias can be reduced to a single quantity or metric. Therefore, for each type of bias, we introduce a set of metrics that capture different aspects of it. Our main contributions are the following: This section introduces the concepts we use in this paper. We start with three definitions.
 News article. An online news article or simply  X  X rticle X  is any document with a publicly-accessible URL, posted on one of the news websites we follow. http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/jun/15/ broadcasting.ofcom News story. An online news story or simply  X  X tory X  is a collection of several articles that are strongly related to a seminal event [15], e.g.  X  X eath of former UK PM Thatcher X . Entity. We focus on people mentioned in the news, i.e. named entities of type person appearing in the content of news articles or Twitter messages. This typically includes politicians, athletes, and artists, among many others.
Bias is offering a partial perspective on facts [18]. The degree to which bias is present on a text is often subject of considerable debate. We consider three types of bias, following the work by [5]: Selection bias or gatekeeping. In partisan politics, the preference for selecting stories from one party. We observe selection bias by determining which media/community cov-ers a certain story or person.
 Coverage bias. In partisan politics, the preference for giving a larger amount of coverage (time/space) to stories about one party. We observe coverage bias by looking at the amount of attention each story or person is given.
 Statement bias. In partisan politics, the preference for expressing more favorable (or more disfavorable) statements for one party. We observe statement bias by looking at the sentiments in statements mentioning different people.
All of the news sources we study have a community of social media users who follows and reposts their stories in social media. There are at least two ways in which these communities can be understood. On one hand, social media communities can be considered a type of  X  X an X  of the news source. On the other hand, some community members can also be considered as part of the interpretive community of news [24], as they are becoming more accustomed to par-ticipate actively on the news process (e.g., discovering new stories or placing them into context).

Both interpretations agree that some users will be more active than others and motivate our next definition. We define the active social media community of an online news source (or  X  X ommunity X  in the rest of this paper), as the set of users who are regularly exposed to articles from that source (most days of the week for instance), are interested in sharing those articles, and are active in social media. In the next section we operationalize this definition.
We assembled two collections, one containing news articles and the other containing Twitter messages ( X  X weets X ). 2
Our data collection covers a large fraction of the English-speaking audience of online news. Alexa 3 maintains a list of the most visited sites on the Web; from this list, we picked the top 100 websites under the category  X  X ews X . We added to this list prominent international news sources listed on
Both collections are available upon request for research pur-poses. http://www.alexa.com/topsites/category/Top/News Wikipedia. 4 We discarded news aggregators (e.g., Yahoo! News) and websites that do not belong to traditional news organizations (e.g., Reddit, The Onion, and PR Web).
Next we determined the RSS feed for each news source, when available, and their corporate Twitter account(s). A news website may have more than one corporate Twitter account. For the cases where they correspond to different sections of the site (e.g., @BBCWorld and @BBCBusiness ), we considered each account as a separate news source. For the cases where one account links to a subset of the news posted from a second account (e.g., @AJELive and @AJEnglish ), we merged them.

During a period of two weeks in April 2013, we checked each source every 30 minutes for new articles. We considered URLs appearing in the RSS feed (when present), or posted through a corporate Twitter account. After downloading, we removed the ancillary elements of each page (common headers, footers, navigational elements, etc.) using a ser-vice 5 that applies an heuristic based on tag-to-text ratio. Finally, named entities where extracted using Open Calais.
News articles can be aggregated into stories that discuss a common event or topic. In order to create news stories, we measured the cosine similarity of pairs of articles using TF.IDF weighting. We use the same measure of text sim-ilarity in other tasks throughout the paper. Two articles having a similarity larger than  X  = 0 . 4 (set empirically on a hold-out set) were considered equivalent in terms of con-tent. We built a graph containing all articles, joining by an edge all articles having a similarity larger than the thresh-old. Each story corresponds to one connected component of this graph, similarly to [25]. These sub-graphs were post-processed to increase precision, ensuring that all articles on each group were closely related to each other. The post-process consisted in recursively removing all vertices with degree less than 2.
The active social media community of a news source should include people who are likely to read the news source almost every day, and who frequently share on Twitter articles from that source. For each article from a news source, we collected the usernames of all Twitter users who posted that URL 7 on Twitter in the first 12 hours after the article X  X  publication. A recent study [11] showed that almost all shares of news articles happen during this period. To avoid automatic ac-counts (bots) we blacklisted all users posting more than 10 articles from a single source within a day. 8 Twitter X  X  API allows to obtain up to 1,500 tweets for each URL, which was enough for all the articles in our observation period.
We define the community of a news source on a given day, as the set of all the people who have tweeted at least K http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_ broadcasting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ International_news_channels http://viewtext.org/ with ratio 0.7. http://www.opencalais.com/
Shortened URLs (e.g. bit.ly ones) were expanded, and all URLs were normalized by removing unnecessary and/or tracking-related parameters.
We actually observed that many of these accounts were later removed/deactivated by Twitter. F igure 1: Depiction of the overlap of the communities articles from that news source in the past K 2 days. While we expect communities to be dynamic, we do not expect them to change completely from day to day, hence we tune the two parameters K 1 and K 2 to provide a certain degree of stability. After experimentation, we set K 1 = 3, K 2 which produces communities that change by roughly 10% of their members every day on average.

Previous works e.g. [1] have considered the followers of a news source on Twitter as its community. While our defini-tion is different, community sizes according to both defini-tions are correlated ( r 2 = 0 . 74, computed in log-log scale). The few exceptions are news media sources with content that does not change on a daily basis, such as Newsweek.
The number of common followers in Twitter between US-based news media has been found to be correlated with po-litical leaning [1]. We perform the same measurement in in-ternational news media and with our definition of communi-ties, and found this to be correlated more with geographical factors than political leaning. The resulting graph, thresh-olded at communities having a Jaccard coefficient greater to 0.03, is shown in Figure 1. We observe clear clusters for UK-, USA-, India-, and Australian-based media. Com-munity overlaps vary widely, with 90% of the news sources having between 2% and 34% of their community shared with at least one other source. The exclusivity of the community of a news source is to a large extent independent from the community size ( r 2 = 0 . 14).

The complete list of data sources, including details on their number of articles, their number of followers, commu-nity sizes, and example stories, are included in the Supple-mentary Material .
Selection bias is also known as gatekeeping . Printed media has space constraints, whereas radio and television broad-cast have temporal constraints. These force editors to rou-tinely take decisions about which (out of potentially hun-dreds or thousands of news stories) to cover. The Web allows for more latitude, but selectivity is still present.
To place selection biases in context, we first study the quantity of stories in online media, and the extent to which those stories are exclusive to one specific news source.
We first compare news sources and their communities in terms of their overall prolificacy. The number of articles each source publishes during a 2-week period is typically in the low hundreds but can reach up to a few thousand in certain cases. We find that the number of different stories a source publishes is correlated ( r 2 = 0 . 83) with the number of articles (distinct URLs) that are published, i.e. the more articles a news source posts, the more likely they are to cover a story. Looking at communities, larger communities tend to post 9 more stories ( r 2 = 0 . 73), and communities post about 2-3 times more stories than the news sources they follow.
Next we observe to what extent the content posted by a news source is unique. A sizable fraction of the English content in news media is produced by agencies. Accord-ing to [17],  X  X nly four organizations do extensive interna-tional reporting (Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC), a few others do some international reporting (CNN, MSN, New York Times, Guardian) and most do no original international report-ing. X  For each article i , we compute its exclusivity E E i = 1  X  max(sim( i,j )), where sim is the cosine similarity with TF.IDF weighting and the maximum is taken across all articles j 6 = i . We find that Associated Press (AP) and other agencies have the most content that is not exclusive. The Economist, Newsweek, and other magazines have the largest amount of original stories; they tend to carry a smaller num-ber of stories, but most of their content is exclusive. Exclu-sivity seems to be weakly correlated (negatively) with the number of stories each media covers ( r 2 =  X  0 . 4), suggest-ing that in news online being prolific does not necessarily require having more original content.
A major factor affecting the selection of stories is their relative importance [7]. We measure the prominence of each story, which corresponds to the fraction of news sources that has at least one article about the story. As in [4], this num-ber ranges from a maximum of 1.0 if the story is in the N news sources in a sample, to a minimum of 1 /N if it is only in 1 of them.

Different news sources may have different policies for the selection of stories. For instance one news media may want to cover only the top stories of the day, while another may want to include a number of minor/niche ones. Indeed, we observe in practice a wide range of prominence distributions across stories published by online news media. In general magazine-type of media such as The Economist or Newsweek tends to focus on stories of high prominence, and covering
A community is said to post a story whenever at least one of its members posts on Twitter the URL of one article be-longing to a story. less stories is correlated with having larger average promi-nence ( r 2 =  X  0 . 51).

Social media, in principle, should allow a broader selection of stories, including niche ones. In general the prominence of stories posted by social media communities is significantly smaller than the prominence of the news media source they follow. In particular, stories of large prominence are not posted as often by social media users. Two factors may contribute to this. First, given that social media users do not need to appeal to a broad audience, they may have a stronger preference for niche content. Second, saturation effects have been observed in Twitter; [20] demonstrated that the probability that a user posts something initially increases with the number of exposures to it, but then drops. Both factors may contribute to observing more stories of smaller prominence in social media.

Statistics for each data source in terms of exclusivity, as well as details on our analysis of prolificacy and examples of prominence distribution for some media can be found in the Supplementary Material .
Next we compare news media according to the overlap in the stories they post, measured by computing for every pair of media the Jaccard coefficient of their sets of stories. In ( a) Selection bias Figure 2: Similarity according to selection bias in (a) order to visualize this similarity matrix, we project it in two dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The result is shown in Figures 2(a) for news sources and 2(b) for social media communities. For online news sources, there is a clear separation between US-based media and the rest. In social media communities, there is much more mixing of different regions. This means that US-based news me-dia tends to agree in their selection of stories, while their communities in social media are interested in a more diverse range of issues. However, as shown next in Section 5.2, they both tend to be more geographically homogeneous when looking at the amount of attention they devote to stories.
Coverage bias is a preference for giving more airtime, space, or attention to some issues in contrast to others [5]. While two news media may publish articles about the same story, it might be the case that one gives the story much more attention than the other.
There are several ways in which the distribution of at-tention given to stories can be quantified. In each news source, we can look at the length of the articles covering the story, counting words and adding across multiple arti-cles of the same story, when necessary. In social media, we count the number of tweets containing links to articles on a given story. Communities tend to be influenced by the news media source they follow. A story prominently displayed and promoted by traditional news sources should obtain a larger number of social media reactions from its community. In addition to observing the distribution of coverage of sto-ries, we can also quantify coverage biases in the treatment of different people, by measuring the distribution of number of mentions per person across different media. These dis-tributions are compared by using the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between them for each pair of news sources, and for each pair of social media communities. Coverage bias by story words and by people mentions are somewhat correlated ( r = 0 . 68). Interestingly, news media coverage as measured by the length of the stories is correlated with the one ob-served in the distribution of social media reactions across all communities ( r = 0 . 84), but not so correlated with the distribution of tweets in each media X  X  community ( r = 0 . 40). This is in agreement with classical results by [13]; the im-portance given by people to different issues tends to be more correlated with media as a whole than with the specific me-dia source(s) each person follows.

More details on the correlations between selection and coverage bias can be found in the Supplementary Material .
We measure the extent of coverage bias with respect to geographical regions and partisan politics.

The distribution of the coverage of different stories, as measured in terms of number of words, is strongly corre-lated with geographical regions, as shown in Figure 2(c). The same happens if we look at the distribution of tweets given to different stories by communities, depicted in Fig-ure 2(d). In both cases, the geographical biases are more evident than when measured using selection-bias metrics. This means that, as expected [7], news media tends to write articles about the country/region where they are based, and (a) Coverage bias (tweets) that those articles tend to be longer and more frequently tweeted by their social media communities. The same geo-graphical biases have been observed online with respect to search queries [23], indicating that users are interested in what is happening around them, and what is happening to those around them.

We observe that the amount of attention social media communities dedicate to stories follows geographical regions more closely than their selection of stories (compare Fig-ures 2(d) and 2(b)). The relative diversity in terms of se-lection can be explained by considering the broad range of stories that each community covers, and the low prominence of those stories. The similarities in terms of coverage are aligned with previous findings [21], in the sense that while anyone in social media can propose new ideas (news stories in our case), only few ideas succeed in getting enough atten-tion. Therefore, although communities talk about a broad range of news, they spend most of their time in a few of them, behaving similarly to traditional news sources.
Next, we use a list of USA-based news sources classi-fied by political party from [2], considering six conservatives (Chicago Tribune, Fox, Forbes, NY Post, Newsmax, U.S. News and Washintong Times) and five liberals (ABC, CBS, NY Times, Huffington and Washington Post). We found a strong correlation between political leaning and measures of coverage of stories (this was not the case when using measures of selection of stories). This is depicted in Fig-ure 3 where we project in 2 dimensions the matrix of JS-divergence between the coverage of media sources. We can see that the distribution of tweets per story follows partisan lines closely, whereas the distribution of story lengths also exhibits the same bias, but not as clearly as in social media. The fact that these biases are stronger in social media than in traditional online news may be due to traditional media attempting to strive for an ideal of objectivity that social media users may not aspire to. This agrees with results in Section 6 where we show that in social media the language seems to be more strongly opinionated.
Statement bias has been used to describe a tendency to-wards using more favorable statements to refer to one polit-ical party at the expense of another [5]. In this section, we study such statements with respect to people in the news, by using sentiment analysis to determine the emotional va-lence (positive or negative) of expressions in which people are mentioned. Sentiment analysis has shown to be a valu-Table 1: People selected in our sample for statement able tool to study emotions expressed in text, e.g. [16] looked at the relationship between tweet sentiments and polls in or-der to examine how the sentiments expressed in Twitter can be used as political or economic indicators.

We sort all named entities of type person in our dataset by decreasing number of mentions. The top of this list is dominated by politicians of international relevance, so we focus on a group of 10 present and former heads of state (plus the Secretary of State of the USA and the Secretary General of the United Nations, both prominently mentioned in our sample). We merge entities referring to the same person, e.g.  X  X bama X  and  X  X arack Obama X . The list is shown in Table 1.

We analyze the sentiments used in relationship to persons in our list, using the dictionary provided by the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) [3]. We use the valence dimension, which assign to each word a number from 1 (if it evokes sadness, dissatisfaction and despair) to 9 (if it evokes happiness, satisfaction, hope). The average sentiment for a person on a news source is the micro-average of sentiments in all the statement on all the articles mentioning that person. The average sentiment for a person on a news community is the average of sentiments in all the tweets posted by mem-bers of that community mentioning the person (according to an exact string match of the last name, which due to their prominence and as verified in our sample, is almost invariably a reference to the correct person).

Statistics about the distribution of the valence of senti-ments are shown in Table 1. In general the lower quantile (more negative sentiments) is significantly lower in social media communities when compared to news sources, across all the persons included in our sample. Other anecdotal ex-amples can be found in the Supplementary Material .
Reputable news reports are expected to be objective; their role is to inform people about what is happening in the world. It is however known that bias exists in the way news is reported by the media e.g. [9]. Most attempts to detect bias are still done on a small scale, with news man-ually examined and coded. In this paper, we automatically process a large sample of articles published in several in-ternational English-speaking online news sites, avoiding the manual coding of articles.

Recently, [12], examined the presence of coverage bias in mainstream news and blogs. They show that overall only a slight slant in terms of party and political leaning could be observed. However, this changes during important political events, such as a mid-term election. We also observe some slight political slants, but the geographical bias seems more prevalent.

In this paper, we focus on three types of bias, selection (gatekeeping), coverage, and statement bias, all studied be-fore. For instance, [5] found no substantial bias on US mag-azines, but a small coverage bias was detected on US tele-vision. With respect to coverage bias, [22] studied Dutch and German television and observed that top leaders such as chancellors or prime ministers get a substantially larger number of mentions than the second most mentioned politi-cians. Finally, for statement bias, [14] found large differ-ences in the sentiment polarity with which US candidates were treated.
We studied the presence of bias in online news and the social media communities that surround them. Our results support the following high-level conclusions.

In international news media, selection and coverage bi-ases seem more correlated with geographical variables than political leaning. In other words, online news sources in a given geographical region tend to select the same stories, and write articles of similar relative length. Social media follows the same pattern, with the communities of media in a region showing a similar proportion of tweets to stories.
Political bias is evident in social media, in terms of the distribution of tweets different stories receive. This distri-bution is more closely related among communities of news media having the same political leaning (at least in the US for which we could obtain political leaning information). Po-litical bias is also observable in terms of the distribution of length of articles on different stories in traditional media, but to a smaller extent than in social media. Statement bias is also evident in social media. In a sample of state-ments referring to world leaders, we find that the language used in social media is more opinionated, and often more negative, than the one used in traditional news media.
In terms of editorial policies regarding the prominence or importance of stories covered, we observe that magazine-type of news (which in general covers less articles and sto-ries) tends to select stories of high prominence and produce exclusive content. More importantly, we observe that social media tend to be much more focused in niche content than traditional news media. In particular, very prominent sto-ries seem to receive much less attention in social media than in traditional news sources.
