 Heterogeneous graph-based r ecommendation frameworks have flexibility in that they can incorporate various recommendation algorithms and various kinds of information to produce better results. In this demonstration, we present a heterogeneous graph-based recommendation simulator wh ich enables participants to experience the flexibility of a heterogeneous graph-based recommendation method. With our system, participants can simulate various recommendation semantics by expressing the semantics via meaningful paths like  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X  . The simulator then returns the recommendation results on the fly based on the user-customized semantics using a fast Monte Carlo algorithm.

It is not only able to simulate vari ous recommendation semantics, but can also adopt various types of input and output. By making use of these advantageous properties, recommendation service providers can test the various algorithms or plan new recommendation services that adopt customized recommendation semantics without the need for code-level modification. In the PathRank framework, the reco mmendation semantics of the recommendation algorithms are represented as semantic paths. For example, collaborative filter ing can be expressed as the framework can easily incorporate various types of information such as time, location, and metadata related to items. Despite these obvious benefits, it is diffic ult to show its superiority in terms of flexibility through experiments. In this demonstration, in order to show the flexibility of the PathRank framework, we present a heterogonous graph-based recommendation simulation tool that allows participants to add their own customized recommendation semantics via intuitive interface. They can also instantly see how the paths contribute to the recommendation results via a comprehensive visualization. The flexible PathRank framework and fast Monte Carlo algorithm enable such functionalities. 
Our proposed system is composed of two components, a graph-based online recommendation engi ne and a web-based user interface. Our recommendation engine is based on S. Lee et al. X  X  framework [2]. In order to allow the user to see the effects of different semantic recommendations, the system should provide the results quickly. Thus the system is implemented as a simulation algorithm using the Monte Carlo method so that the given semantic paths can be quick ly reflected in the recommender system. The web-based user interface provides an intuitive semantic path interface and recommendation result visualizer. We will describe the design of the entire system in detail. In our demonstration, the HetRec 2011 MovieLens dataset 1 published by the GroupLens research group was used. Our recommendation engine ranks items according to their PathRank [2] score. PathRank is defined via iterative matrix operations like Personalized Pa geRank. Meanwhile, computing the PathRank score via matrix multiplications or other similar techniques is time consuming and does not provide a prompt output. To solve this problem, we apply the Monte Carlo method in computing the PathRank scores. Our recommendation algorithm is described as follows. 
Algorithm 1: Computing PathRank using the Monte Carlo method 
N random walkers are initiated at the query nodes. Let each of them iteratively do an opera tion among the following three options: 1) move to one of the adjacent nodes with the transition probability, 2) follow one of given paths with the path following probability, and 3) stop with the restart probability. The PathRank score of each node is computed by transforming the number of random walkers stopped at the node to the probability. In our implementation, we confirmed that the estimated PathRank scores can be generated in a few seconds when the number of sample size N is about ten thousands in the HeteRec 2011 MovieLens dataset on a laptop. 
The web-based user interface provides a tool for defining the semantic paths along with path recommendation functionality and visualizations of the recommendation process of the top-k results to help the user choose the best path for the user X  X  needs. 
The schema graph and the chosen semantic paths are depicted in Figure 1(a). By using Aditva et al. X  X  method [1], the heterogeneous graph is constructed from the data stored in the relational database. Once the hete rogeneous graph is constructed, the user can define and test va rious recommendati on semantics by defining semantic paths through th e web interface. The user can input semantic paths in two ways; they can define semantic paths by clicking the nodes in the sc hema graph window or choose a predefined path from an automatically generated list of recommended paths. The recommended paths are selected from all possible paths by evaluating e ach path on a sample graph using F-measure. In Figure 1(a), the first path, which means  X  recommend a movie directed by the same director of the movie that a target user liked , X  is manually inserted. The third long path was selected from the recommended pa th list in Figure 1(b). It is difficult to understand the implications of the path, but it could possibly increase performance fa ctors such as precision. 
In the visualization area, the top-k recommendation results produced using the given semantic paths and queries are presented to provide understanding of how the results are generated by the algorithms. For this step, the user should enter a query node manually or use automatically sampled query nodes. The recommendation results are then represented in the form of a graph where each of the nodes is represented by a pie graph with different colors. Each portion of pie graph is proportional to the number of random walkers that passed through each of the semantic paths, and the radius of the pie graph is proportional to the PathRank score. This visualizat ion tells the user whether the node is popular or semantic-biased . The trace of a single Monte Carlo sample per each top-k result is animated with pursuant information such as the title of the movie to show how the item is recommended. 
Figure 2 shows an example of a recommendation of a movie for a user. In this figure, the user can see that the movie titled  X  X emento X  is recommended because a number of random walkers have passed through the semantic path. Figure 2. Example of the visua lization of a recommendation 
Finally, a report on the evaluatio n metrics such as precision is given for each semantic path entered. This report can tell the user which path has more contributions to the accurate recommendation. We look forward to this report helping the service provider to select the semantic paths that result in more accurate recommendation results. 
In this demonstration, we present a novel simulation tool that enables participants to experience the flexibility of a heterogeneous graph-based recomme ndation framework. In future works, we plan to find the paths that most successfully satisfy diverse aspects of requirements such as novelty and context-awareness.
