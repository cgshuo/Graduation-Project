 Instructors:  X  Zhengdong Lu and Hang Li Abstract: Neural network X based methods have been viewed as one of the major driving force in the recent development of natural language processing (NLP). We all have witnessed with great excitement how this subfield advances: new ideas emerge at an unprecedented speed and old ideas resurge in unexpected ways. In a nutshell, there are two major trends: Both trends are important to researchers in the computational linguistics community. Fundamental ideas like external memory or reinforcement learning, although introduced to NLP only recently, have quickly lead to significant improvement on tasks like natural language generation and question answering. On the other hand, with complicated neural systems with many cooperating components, it calls for linguistic knowledge in designing the right mechanism, architecture, and sometimes training setting.
 As a simple example, the introducing of automatic alignment in neural machine translation, has quickly led to the state X of X the X art performance in machine translation and triggered a large body of sequence X to X sequence models. It is therefore important to get the researchers in computational linguistics community acquainted with the recent progress in deep learning for NLP. We will focus on the work and ideas strongly related to the core of natural language and yet not so familiar to the majority of the community, which can be roughly categorized into: 1) the differentiable data X structures, and 2) the learning paradigms for NLP.
 Differentiable data X structures, starting with the memory equipped with continuous operations in Neural Turing Machine, have been the foundation of deep models with sophisticated operations. Some members of it, such as Memory Network, have become famous on tasks like question answering and machine translation, while other development in this direction, including those with clear and important application in NLP, are relatively new to this community.
 Deep learning, with its promise on end X to X end learning, not only enables the training of complex NLP models from scratch, but also extends the training setting to include remote and indirect supervision. We will introduce not only the end X to X end learning in its general notion, but also newly emerged topics in formulating learning objective, taming the non X differentiable operations, and designing the learning system for getting supervision signal from real world.
