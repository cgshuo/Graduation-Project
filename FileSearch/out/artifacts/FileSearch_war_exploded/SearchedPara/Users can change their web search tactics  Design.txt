 1. Introduction
Categorized overviews of web search results are a promising way to support user exploration, understand-ing, and discovery. These search interfaces, also referred to as faceted or guided search interfaces, combine a metadata-based overview with the list of search results to enable a rich form of interaction. The strategies and tactics that searchers use are affected by the capabilities provided by the search interface ( Bates, 1990; Marchionini, 1995; Shneiderman &amp; Plaisant, 2004; Wildemuth, 2004 ).

Designers build interfaces to support specific strategies and tactics, based on intuition or analysis. But the effect of new capabilities on search tactics may not be what designers anticipate. Unexpected problems may negate expected benefits. Serendipitous possibilities may present to searchers. In response, searchers may adapt their tactics and strategies as they become familiar with the capabilities. Our research seeks to under-stand how exploratory search systems with rich user interfaces change the way that searchers think about and pursue their searches. What strategies and tactics do exploratory search interfaces enable? And, ulti-mately, do they enable searchers to achieve their higher-level objectives? One outcome of this research is a set of guidelines that search interface designers can use to support exploratory searchers through the design of categorized overview interfaces. 1.1. Research questions
Three research questions for this study were: 1. How do searchers think differently about their search tactics when categorized overviews are available to augment the result list? 2. What kinds of behaviors do searchers exhibit when categorized overviews are available? 3. In what ways could the presence of categorized overviews affect the quality of the search outcome?
Evaluation of exploratory search systems is an exciting research challenge ( White, Muresan, &amp; Marchionini, many different task outcomes for different searchers, making it difficult to specify quantitative performance measures like time to completion, error rates, precision, or recall. Completing an exploratory task often involves developing and refining an information need that is specific to the individual. Documents that have great utility or novelty to one person may have little value to another, because of variations in domain knowl-edge, interests, and previously encountered information, so establishing ground truth for a measure of rele-vance is problematic. To mitigate these problems, this study adopted a mixed methods approach. It shows how a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods can address research questions related to explor-atory search.

Following a brief description of related work, the experiment design is described Section 3 . Section 4 pre-poses eight design guidelines suggested or refined by the study. Section 7 concludes with a summary of the contributions and suggestions for future research. 2. Related work
At least one commercial search engine (Exalead.com) has implemented categorized overviews of web search results. However we are not aware of any studies of this approach. Evaluations of categorized overviews in non-web domains have assessed and rated the quality of a task outcome to generate quantitative measures decomposed or narrowed to constrain the task ( Janecek &amp; Pu, 2005 ). Log studies have been used to explore user needs and mistakes in web search ( Jansen, Spink, &amp; Saracevic, 2000 ).

Task-based evaluation of exploratory search systems using controlled experiments has been effective for showing subjective satisfaction differences between systems, but less effective at showing objective differences
Evaluations have assessed and rated the quality of a task outcome to generate quantitative measures on a les-son plan creation task ( Kabel et al., 2004 ) or measured incidental learning that occurred during a search ses-&amp; Pu, 2005 ). A combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods have also been used ( Toms, Freund, Kopak, &amp; Bartlett, 2003; Yee et al., 2003 ).

Research prototypes and commercial search engines have incorporated categorized overviews, but there have been few, if any, user studies of categorized overviews for exploratory web search, and there is little research explaining whether they are effective, why, and under what circumstances. Research is needed to understand how categorized overviews change the way users conduct web searches, to guide the design of search engine interfaces, and to justify the entry and maintenance of category metadata. 3. Experimental design
Based on previous research ( Kules and Shneiderman, submitted for publication ), we expected to observe quantifiable and significant differences in specific behaviors and preferences. For example, we expected that are highlighted in Section 4.1 ; however this paper focuses on the qualitative results. We anticipated that the interface would prompt additional behavioral changes, but there was no a priori list. A qualitative approach used a combination of observation and semi-structured interview questions. The study was initially designed to also investigate the effect of broad and narrow topics, but that aspect was problematic and is not discussed here. Details of the complete study can be found in Kules (2006b) . 3.1. The SERVICE search system
This study used the SERVICE (SEarch Result Visualization and Interactive Categorized Exploration) search system ( Kules, 2006b ) (see http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/categorizedoverview ). The SERVICE system was designed to be a flexible, extensible architecture and framework for research in categorizing search inter-the left of the result list ( Fig. 2 ).

With the categorized overview enabled, clicking on a category filters (or narrows) the displayed results to just the pages within that category. Searchers can remove filters by clicking on a facet label (which removes filters based on that facet) or a special link (which removes all filters). Moving the pointer over a category of populated subcategories. Moving the pointer over a result highlights all the categories in the overview that contain the result.

Categories were drawn from the open directory project (ODP) and a database of US Government web sites 2002 ): Topic, Geography and US Government. The topical facet, extracted from the ODP web directory ( www.dmoz.org ), classified web sites according to 14 top-level categories ( Table 1 ). The geographic facet was extracted from the ODP top-level category, Region. A database of federal government web sites was used to create the US Government facet. Web sites were categorized into the top two levels of each hierarchy. The categorized overviews were thus comprised of three 2-level facets.

When a user submits a query, the SERVICE system sends it to the Google search engine, retrieves the top
The US government classifier uses an existing database that maps government web pages into a government hierarchy, for example mapping http://www.af.mil/ to the hierarchy node  X  X /Executive/Executive_Agencies/
Department_of_Defense/Department_of_the_Air_Force X  X . On its own, this classifier has coverage that is lim-ited to the list of URLs in the database. We extended coverage by using prefix matching, i.e., any URL begin-ning with www.af.mil would be mapped to this node, unless a more detailed match was found. The Topic and
Geography classifier uses the ODP RDF data, applying a prefix matching technique similar to the US Gov-ernment classifier. Since web sites can be cataloged in multiple categories, this yields a list of zero or more categories for each result. Although many web sites are not in either database, in initial tests an average of 66% of the top 100 search results were categorized within the ODP, and 62% of the top 100 search results were categorized within the US Government hierarchy ( Kules et al., 2006 ). This was acceptable for the study, although participant comments (Section 4.2 ) reveal some limitations of this approach. 3.2. Experimental conditions
This study used a 2  X  2 within-subjects comparative design ( N = 24), with System (baseline or categorized overview) and Topic Type (broad or narrow) as the independent variables. Each participant used both sys-tems. System presentation order was counterbalanced. 3.3. Scenario and task design
A high-level scenario was constructed around an exploratory search task for journalists. A simulated work task ( Borlund, 2003 ) provided a  X  X over story X  and an indicative task that instructed participants to conduct a short web search to generate 8 X 10 ideas for newspaper articles on a given topic. Journalists X  information needs are often uncertain, and can change in response to external events (such as breaking news) or internal needs hours between story assignment and filing. These characteristics guided design of the scenario and task, which were reviewed by a journalism professor to ensure that they were appropriate for the journalism students we and task are included in the Appendix .
 The four topics used for the study were: Workplace allergies (WA) The aging workforce (AW) Human smuggling (HS) International art crime (IAC) 3.4. Participants
Twenty-four experienced web searchers (5 male, 19 female, primarily journalism students) were recruited and paid $30 for their participation. They ranged in age from 18 to 27 years, with a median age of 20.
Twenty-one were undergraduate students, one was a graduate student and two had graduate degrees. All reported at least three years of search experience, and all but two reported searching at least once per day.
All used the Google search engine. 3.5. Materials
The search interfaces were assigned neutral names (Kittery for the baseline and Portsmouth for the exper-imental) and displayed alongside a small web application, the Collector form ( Fig. 3 ). The Collector form pro-vided fields to capture the ideas to be generated as part of the indicative task for later assessment by the researcher, as well as the relevant URLs. It listed them in reverse chronological order so participants could refer to them during the session. The screen resolution was 1280  X  1024 pixels. Before each search, the search window was set to 1024 pixels wide and the collector window to 256 pixels wide.

A written script provided participants with background information on the study, to describe the scenario and task and to introduce the training task. Three short (1 X 3 min) training videos introduced participants to the two interfaces and the Collector form. An entry questionnaire collected participants X  demographic and search experience data. A pre-search questionnaire captured knowledge of each topic prior to the search. A post-search questionnaire repeated the pre-search questions and collected reactions to the topic, interface and search process. The exit interview questions were read to the participants from a paper form.
Participants used a laptop with a 15 inch, 1280  X  1024 pixel display, an external keyboard and mouse, and a desktop microphone. Camtasia Studio 3 was used to capture screen video and audio. The SERVICE search system was configured to log all pages visited, plus detailed data on category and result list clicks, mouse movements, and scrolling. 3.6. Procedure
Sessions were individually conducted in an office on the university campus. After participants signed the informed consent form, they completed the online entry questionnaire and viewed the training video appro-priate to the first interface condition. Following the video, the scenario and task were described, and they practiced with the topic  X  X  X rban sprawl. X  X  A training checklist ensured that they used the basic system features on their own or with prompting. During both the training and measured tasks, they were encouraged to use a think-aloud protocol ( Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1984 ).

They were then presented with the first topic. They completed the online pre-search questionnaire, per-formed the timed search and completed the post-search questionnaire. This was repeated for the second topic.
After a short break, they were shown the video for the second interface and given practice time to become comfortable with it. The remaining two searches were then completed. The session concluded with a semi-structured exit interview. All sessions, including training, searches and interviews were recorded and partici-pants were instructed to think out loud while they searched. This provided a total of about 100 minutes of audio and video per session.

Materials and procedures were pilot tested with 12 participants. Based on the pilot tests, the practice time was extended to permit participants to work until they felt comfortable with both the systems and the ters. The final pilot tests confirmed that the session duration was about 2 h and 15 min, including about 30 min for the semi-structured exit interview. 3.7. Analysis methodology
The quantitative data sets were analyzed using the null hypothesis that there was no difference between the groups. A p -value of 0.05 was used to reject that hypothesis. For ANOVA analyses, when the raw data did not icant ANOVA results, the normal Quantile X  X uantile (Q X  X ) Plots were examined to confirm that the residuals were distributed normally.

A limited qualitative analysis was conducted on responses to three open-ended questions from the interview: 1. Did the categorized overview change the way you searched? Can you describe an example? 2. Can you describe an example where the categorized overview [helped; OR hindered, frustrated or mislead  X  whichever not indicated in previous question]? 3. Did you notice any difference in how you used the categorized overview each time? Can you describe an example?
These questions required introspection and reflection. Introspection and reflection can allow the investiga-tor to gain access to thoughts that are  X  X  X ediated by knowledge structures or artifacts that we design and use X  X  ( Nielsen, Clemmensen, &amp; Yssing, 2002 ). Categorized overviews are designed expressly to expose specific knowledge structures, thus this form of analysis is appropriate. To minimize known problems with verbal concrete details.

Responses for each question were transcribed into an Access database and an inductive approach was used to develop and assign an initial code list. Particular attention was paid to how participants articulated their thoughts about search tactics, actions, and outcomes. Each response was reviewed by one researcher, who assigned a short label to sets of related comments. After 12 responses were coded, the codes were reviewed.
Obvious duplicates were merged before coding the remaining responses. A second full pass was conducted to review the initial assignments and assign a small number of new codes. The codes were divided into five groups to organize the subsequent analysis.

This analysis represents a principled approach to answering the research questions, drawing on the natu-ralistic inquiry paradigm ( Guba &amp; Lincoln, 1982 ). It complements the quantitative analysis, which seeks to identify commonalities across search experiences, by illuminating differences in search experiences. The use of a single researcher is an acknowledged limitation of this study; however, the analysis and results were peer-reviewed. 4. Results
These 24 sophisticated users coping with challenging search tasks over a two-hour period produced a wealth of data. The quantitative data show some differences in behavior and strong preferences. They do not show objective differences in outcomes. The qualitative data include thoughtful comments indicating strengths and weaknesses of the categorized overviews. 4.1. Summary of quantitative results 4.1.1. Original location of viewed (clicked on) pages in search result list
Searchers viewed (clicked on) a total of 924 pages from the search results. The results of a 2 (system)  X  4
F (3,919) = 5.73, p &lt; 0.01. Searchers viewed pages at a mean (median) depth of 28.4 (18) when using the cat-egorized overview, whereas they viewed pages at a mean depth of 22.3 (12) with the baseline. The plot in Fig. 4 shows modest but noticeable differences in the distribution of viewed pages. Although the distribution is sim-overview. 4.1.2. Proportion of pages collected from categorized facets
Not all pages were categorized in the available facets, and we were interested in whether searchers were more likely to collect categorized pages when using the categorized overview (see Table 2 ). Searchers collected a total of 679 pages. The proportion of categorized pages differed significantly by System, v (7.5 percentage points) has implications that are discussed in Section 5.1 . 4.1.3. Number of queries issued during searches
Searchers conducted a total of 96 searches. All subjects except one issued at most 10 queries. One subject issued 15 queries during a search, and that outlier is removed from the following analysis. The results of a 2 by topic F (3,87) = 3.63, p &lt; 0.05. The mean (median) number of queries per search was 3.0 (2) for the cate-gorized overview system and 3.5 (3) for the baseline. 4.1.4. Perceived organization of search results
Subjects were asked to rate agreement with the statement,  X  X  X he system helped me organize my search
The mean agreement for the categorized overview system was 7.4, and the mean agreement for the baseline system was 4.9. The corresponding medians were 7 and 5. 4.1.5. Agreement that system helped assess results and decide what to do next
Subjects were asked to rate agreement with the statement,  X  X  X he system helped me assess the results of my icant difference by topic. The mean agreement for the categorized overview system was 6.5, and the mean agreement for the baseline system was 5.3. The corresponding medians were 7 and 5. 4.1.6. Adjectives to describe system ysis for each of the eight system adjectives (semantic differentials) identified three measures that showed sig-by topic were identified. 4.1.7. Idea quality
The quality of the generated ideas was assessed blind by a single researcher. High quality ideas would pose a question or paradox, contain conflict and human interest elements, indicate the context of the idea, and reflect intangible elements such as  X  X  X oolness. X  X  Other factors included timeliness and potential impact.
Two passes were made through the ideas for each topic to gain familiarity before assigning a final quality rating.

Searchers generated a total of 679 ideas. Idea quality was generally low, perhaps in part because of the time limit, which several participants commented on. Although a nine-point scale was used (1 = poor, 9 = excellent), the highest rating assigned was 5. A Wilcoxon rank sum test did not detect a significant dif-ference in Idea Quality by System. A Kruskal X  X allis test detected a marginally significant difference by Topic, p &lt; 0.10.
 4.2. Qualitative findings
The relatively long (2 h) study time enabled participants to consider their tactics and produced insights into the search processes of sophisticated searchers coping with challenging tasks. This section is organized by the derived code groups: behavioral differences, cognitive and affective impacts, judgments of outcome, and facet and category usage. 4.2.1. Behavioral impacts Table 3 provides an overview of the behaviors that participants commented upon.

Participants indicated that they used the overviews to filter, narrow, refine and explore their results. One participant was particularly effusive about the ease of narrowing her results, appreciating the immediacy of the interaction.

Two participants felt that they used fewer queries, which is consistent with the quantitative findings, and five felt that their queries were more general when they used the categorized overview. Two people commented that they used the overview when they were stuck. Most participants commented positively on the apparent reduction in work, but two expressed reservations about the change in their tactics.

Participants commented on interesting effects that the categorized overviews had on tactics ( Table 4 ), ticular result in the list. Participants were observed reading the subcategory pop-up windows, which provided a form of query preview ( Tanin, Plaisant, &amp; Shneiderman, 2000 ), before clicking on that category or moving the pointer to a different category. Twelve participants said (later in the interview) they used the pop-up sub-category list to assess what they would find in specific categories or decide whether to explore them. The cat-egorized overview appeared to provide cues, similar to  X  X  X nformation scent X  X  ( Pirolli &amp; Card, 1995 ), that induced participants to explore categories instead of issuing a new query.

Participants spoke of the difficulty of changing established search tactics. During the session, we observed some searchers change their tactics rapidly, whereas others only started to change. During their first catego-rized overview search they often appeared to be exploring the interface and probing categories; comments like  X  X  X et X  X  see what this is X  X  were frequent. By their second categorized overview search, all but two partici-pants took advantage of the overview. Those two participants did not appear to change their tactics. They thought of specific ideas and searched for related pages instead of using the overview to guide their idea generation.
 In one case, a participant avoided a page because it did not fall in the category he expected: 4.2.2. Cognitive and affective impacts Table 5 provides an overview of the cognitive and affective impacts that participants commented upon.
The placement of pages within categories generated comments from 19 participants. This is not surprising because the interview questions specifically asked about problems. Eight participants commented on pages that did not belong within a category at all, judging them as incorrectly categorized. Eight others indicated that they found unexpected pages in a category. This occurred even though the instructions emphasized that it was typically the web sites that were categorized, not specific web pages. The prevalence of these concerns suggests that searchers may not understand the nature of the relationship entailed by category membership, as this comment suggests:
Seven participants commented on the structure or organization of a facet as being confusing or non-intuitive.
 Two people found the topical categories too general and one person found them ambiguous.

Four people commented that the categories helped generate ideas. For three participants, the categories exposed them to different aspects of the topic:
One person used the overview to get an overall sense of how results were distributed within or across top-level categories:
One person was concerned about possibly missing useful pages in unexplored categories. 4.2.3. Judgments of outcomes Table 6 provides an overview of participants judgments of their search outcomes.
 Participant comments included judgments on the impact of the categorized overview on their searches. During their responses to the questions, ten participants indicated that the categorized overview was helpful.
Three felt it was unhelpful and one commented that it was mixed overall. Eight participants commented that the problems they encountered were minor or did not hinder their search.

The qualitative data suggest that ideas were provoked by the categorized overviews. Six participants felt that they would not have generated specific ideas without the overviews. The data also suggest a possible neg-ative outcome on the quality of ideas. One participant indicated concern that idea quality was negatively affected, indirectly, by changes in his search tactics due to the overview. His thoughtful comment indicated that he felt that he was not getting as many good results because he relied on exploring the categories instead when to use the categorized overview and when to submit a new query.

Most participants appreciated and used the overview, but there were no observed differences in the quality of the story ideas they generated with the overviews. This could indicate that the task was less dependent on gaining an overview than originally anticipated. When the categorized overview was not available, scanning ipant comments suggest that the challenging nature of the experimental task, the tight time limit and the topic ideas. 4.2.4. Facet and category usage Table 7 provides an overview of participant comments on facet and category use.

Twenty-one participants commented on aspects of their use of the Topic Category facet. Seven commented on using the Geographic facets and four commented on using the US Government facet. Participants found ticipant commented: 4.3. Limitations
The experienced participants ( N = 24) were primarily journalism students, so the scenario and task was appropriate for them, but they might not be representative of the needs of other exploratory searchers. A sin-gle, assigned scenario and task type was evaluated. Other exploratory search tasks may benefit more or less from the categorized overview. Post-search questionnaires were completed after each topic search, which could potentially influence search tactics for subsequent searches. The time available was substantial for each minutes) was also short, which limited their ability to conduct more thorough searches and generate high qual-ity ideas. A longitudinal or multi-day study could overcome this shortcoming by giving searchers time to adapt before conducting the assessed tasks.

The study was limited by several factors related to the categories. Only three facets were used: Topic, Geog-raphy, and US Government. A modest proportion of pages was categorized (40 X 80%). The facets and cate-gories enabled a pragmatic assessment of categorizing web search results with human-edited databases. Incorporating automated classification techniques might improve categorization rates.

The research was conducted in a laboratory setting rather than the participants X  own workplaces. Partici-pants did, however, show an awareness of these differences, and they commented on the similarity of the research setting to their workplace. More importantly, a single researcher analyzed and interpreted the raw qualitative data, including idea quality. The study does make modest use of triangulation with the quantitative data. The interpretations were closely tied to the raw data, often using the same language that participants used. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results. 5. Discussion 5.1. Differences in search behavior
The categorized overviews changed searcher behavior. With the overviews, participants explored signifi-cantly more deeply within the result list. This is consistent with previous studies ( Ka  X  ki, 2005 ).
When using the overviews, participants collected more pages that were categorized (i.e., they collected fewer uncategorized pages). Thus the categorized overview biased participants toward pages that were found in at least one category. Whether this bias is positive or negative depends on the context of search, the number of uncategorized pages, the value of the uncategorized pages, and the impact of not viewing the uncategorized pages. This bias reinforces the concern, expressed by one participant, that searchers might overlook important information by using the categories. Searchers should understand when they are narrowing their search to cat-egorized results, whether it is important for them to view uncategorized results, and how to do so. This sug-gests a need for better training and/or clearer indications to searchers that their results are being filtered. 5.2. Categorization challenges
The use of the ODP categories resulted in several challenges. When page categories did not match searcher expectations, they experienced mild frustration, confusion or doubt. Three factors may have contributed to this: First, different kinds of relationships are encoded in the hierarchy. For example, pages from the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) were categorized under/TopicCategory/Arts/Television, which is closer to encoding an is-a relationship than an about relationship. Thus, when a BBC web page about a human smug-gling story was found under Television, it was puzzling to many participants. It did not match their expecta-tions. Second, participants commented on the generality or ambiguity of categories, particularly the topic categories. This could be attributed, at least in part, to the limited depth of the hierarchy (two levels) in the categorized overview. The ODP-assigned categories were frequently four or more levels deep. Truncating the categories removed detailed contextual information. Finally, the category structure was sometimes prob-lematic. For example, some participants did not initially expect to find the Television category under Arts, and they found this troubling.

There are three implications for search interface designers: First, different relationships encoded in the hier-parent-child (or broader-narrower) relationships that are clear when encountered while browsing a thesaurus or directory of web pages, will not always be clear when used in the context of a categorized overview of search results. The hierarchy may need to be changed, suggesting a new principle ( X  X  X se separate facets for each type should analyze at least the top two levels of a hierarchy, considering whether they need to be adjusted to pro-identify additional facets. This might yield substantial improvements in the perceived accuracy of the category assignments. A lightweight tool could allow experienced indexers or  X  X  X ower searchers X  X  with expertise in spe-cific domains to customize hierarchies by splitting, merging, promoting, or hiding categories. 5.3. Cognitive impact of categorized overviews These results suggest that the categorized overviews were no more difficult to use than the baseline overall.
There was no significant difference in the overwhelming/manageable or complex/simple measures. This does not mean that complexity effects, which two participants commented on, should be ignored. Indeed, one par-ticipants found the additional category information and the ability to preview and narrow results beneficial. This reinforces the value of providing searchers additional control over their search ( Greene, Marchionini, whether to display or hide the categorized overview.

Participants managed problems by relying on the stability of the categories during the second categorized overview task. This could be a benefit when compared to automatically clustered or dynamically generated pretation. Participants agreed that the categorized overview organized the results well and helped them assess their results and decide what to do next. Participants also found the categorized overview more generally appealing ( X  X  X onderful X  X ) and stimulating. The satisfaction ratings, which favored the categorized overview, were marginally significant. 5.4. Future research using longitudinal studies
The study highlighted an important consideration for future research: It takes time for searchers to reflect on their searches and refine their tactics. Researchers should consider using a longitudinal approach to inves-tigate how web searchers adapt tactics when rich interfaces like categorized overviews are available ( Kules, 2006a ). Longitudinal studies have been used to examine changes in tactics and query terms in relation to changes in searchers X  information problem stage while developing a research proposal ( Vakkari, 2000 ). In-depth, longitudinal case studies have been used to evaluate information visualization interfaces and creativity support tools ( Shneiderman et al., 2006; Shneiderman &amp; Plaisant, 2006 ). These techniques integrate ethno-graphic and quantitative methods, using participant observation, surveys, interviews, and usage logs to study users performing complex tasks with individually defined goals. They present the opportunity to observe changes as searchers become familiar with an exploratory search system and tactics mature. 6. Design guidelines for categorized overviews This study helped refine a set of design guidelines we are developing for categorized overview interfaces.
They are particularly intended to support exploratory search. Eight design guidelines were suggested or refined by this study: 1. Provide overviews of large sets of results. 2. Organize overviews around meaningful categories. 3. Clarify and visualize category structure. 4. Tightly couple category labels to result list. 5. Ensure that the full category information is available. 6. Support multiple types of categories and visual presentations. 7. Use separate facets for each type of category. 8. Arrange text for scanning/skimming. 6.1. Provide overviews of large sets of results
During exploratory search, hundreds or thousands of results are potentially relevant. An effective overview helps searchers understand the contents of the result set and make decisions on which results to examine ( Hearst, 1999b ). This study showed that users did not always use the overview first, but providing one gives searchers the flexibility to use the best tool for them at the moment, either the overview or the list. number of results will depend on many factors, including the task domain, topic, the quality and quantity of documents, and search engine capabilities. The fact that many pages viewed were ranked in the range of 50th-out introducing overwhelming complexity. 6.2. Organize overviews around meaningful categories
Gaining an overview of search results involves a number of cognitive subtasks, including interpretation of the results within the context of the searcher X  X  internal mental model of the knowledge domain. Meaningful categories support learning, reflection, discovery, and information retrieval ( Kwasnik, 1999; Soergel, 1999 ).
This study suggests that categorized overviews based on topic, geography, and the US government supported beneficial search tactics. Categories based on document format, language, or Domain Name Service (DNS) domain may be useful ( Kules et al., 2006 ). Numeric attributes such as date or size can be grouped into mean-ingful categories. Even abstract or computed attributes such as a journal impact factor ( Garfield, 2005 ) can form the basis of meaningful, albeit controversial or limited, categories.

This study also suggests that stable categories will allow searchers to reuse category knowledge on subse-quent searches. Dynamic categories, such as those generated by automated clustering techniques, change with each query. Thus the learning benefits of stable categories may accrue less, but they may provide other benefits ( Kules and Shneiderman, submitted for publication ). 6.3. Clarify and visualize category structure If categories are drawn from a classification, taxonomy, or ontology, the structure should be made visible.
It provides context for individual category labels, shows relationships between concepts and allows users to focus on the portions of the concept space that are of most interest. The visual presentation must be disci-plined to avoid overwhelming or disorienting searchers.

This study suggests that practitioners should review at least the top two levels of a hierarchy, considering whether they need to be adjusted to provide the clearest overview. In general, broad, shallow hierarchies are beneficial ( Jacko &amp; Salvendy, 1996; Kiger, 1984; Miller, 1981 ). This study showed that parent-child (or broader-narrower) relationships that are clear when encountered while browsing a thesaurus or directory of web pages are not always clear when used in the context of a categorized overview of search results.
The structure of the hierarchy may need to be changed in these cases. 6.4. Tightly couple category labels to result list
Brushing and linking techniques tightly couple multiple views of data in an information visualization, so that an action in one view (brushing) is linked to an action in another view. This can be applied to search bach, 2003 ). Judicious use of this technique can support richer interactions between category information and individual results. The SERVICE system provides two examples of tight coupling: clicking on category labels it allows searchers to very quickly see examples. Within a category, example results help to clarify the meaning of the categories and often provide indications of relevance, quality, etc. Even within well-known classifica-tions, some category labels may be ambiguous or unfamiliar. Examples of individual pages can disambiguate category names ( Dumais, Cutrell, &amp; Chen, 2001 ).

When this capability is implemented, it is important to provide clear feedback indicating which categories are currently applied. Observations from this study suggest that participants occasionally forgot or overlooked the fact that they were viewing a subset of their original query. 6.5. Ensure that full category information is available
When using deep hierarchies, designers should ensure that full category information (the complete label or descriptor) is available to searchers. The category labels in the overview indicate which categories results are in, but this may be limited to the top few levels because of the limited display space. During this study, par-ticipants wondered aloud what specific category results were in. Participants were occasionally frustrated label could alleviate this problem. Displaying category labels in each result can be helpful ( Drori &amp; Alon, 2003 ). However, when this was implemented in the SERVICE system, the individual results became too large because results often appeared in multiple categories. Therefore, it was disabled prior to the study. During development, we also experimented briefly with opening a pop-up window when the pointer moved over the result. A small hyperlink in each result may be an appropriate design compromise, although this was not implemented or evaluated. These alternatives should be investigated in future studies. 6.6. Support multiple types of categories and visual presentations
No single type of category is effective for all users, tasks, and domains. In her comparison of categories and clustering for organizing search results, Hearst (1999a) noted that neither categories nor automatically con-structed clusters will always align with users X  interests. Libraries provide subject, author, and title indexes and archives provide multiple finding aids for their holdings. GRiDL ( Shneiderman, Feldman, Rose, &amp; Grau, ( www.exalead.com ) search engines are examples of search result interfaces that permit users to reorganize results using alternate sets of categories. During previous studies, several participants noted that they would like to be able to select or define their own categories and re-arrange them for their own purposes ( Kules and
Shneiderman, submitted for publication ). Likewise, no single presentation style is ideal for all situations and and the corresponding increase in complexity is not appropriate for the intended users, designers should have a variety of categories and presentation styles to choose from, so they can choose appropriate categories and visual presentation styles. It may be useful to enable an experienced searcher to customize the overview and share it with others. Supporting multiple classifications and multiple visual presentations may enable users to view and explore search results from the perspectives most appropriate to their needs. 6.7. Use separate facets for each type of category
When a rich set of categories encodes multiple types of relationships, presenting them as separate visual facets can clarify meanings and relationships that might otherwise be ambiguous. For example, categories for is-a , is-about , and part-of relationships should be presented separately. Faceted classification organizes a domain into orthogonal sets of categories, which are ideally homogeneous, mutually exclusive, and represent thesauri ( Soergel, 1974; Vickery, 1960 ), information spaces on the Web ( Louie, Maddox, &amp; Washington, the development of the SERVICE system. During informal user tests, searchers experienced confusion when topical and geographic categories were used in the same facet. Separating geographic categories from topical categories in the final interface helped reduce this problem in this study. Other instances of categories that should have been separated out remained problematic. Therefore, hierarchies used in a categorized overview should be analyzed to determine whether they should be restructured into separate facets. The informal anal-ysis performed during development yielded a noticeable improvement, suggesting that even a lightweight fac-eted analysis focused on the upper levels of a hierarchy could be beneficial. 6.8. Arrange text for scanning/skimming
At a perceptual level, users of search results attempt to rapidly ingest large amounts of text. We observed searchers scanning category labels, titles, URLs, and snippets of text to quickly select specific pages to view.
They skimmed the pages and returned to the list to repeat this cycle. It could be argued that this is simply a result of the textual presentation format, but it also reflects more fundamentally that the source documents are inherently textual and are not easily presented graphically. Arranging these elements in a consistent manner than requiring interaction such as moving the pointer over an item) will support fast scanning and skimming. Aula (2004) found that presenting snippets as bulleted lists was 20% faster than the standard textual display.
Appropriate use of font weights, styles, sizes, and colors will also help ( Tullis, 1988 ). 6.9. Summary
These design guidelines for categorized overviews have been suggested or refined by the design and evalu-ation of the SERVICE system. They complement and extend general human-computer interaction, web face designers because they provide guidance for the appropriate integration of visual overviews with search tive or comprehensive. Evaluations and analysis of other exploratory search interfaces will certainly suggest additional guidelines. 7. Conclusion
This study answers our research questions by revealing tactical and cognitive benefits of categorized over-views: (1) Searchers explored results more deeply; (2) they agreed that the categorized overviews helped them organize, explore and assess their results without being appreciably more complex than typical Google-like interfaces. No quantitive differences were detected in the quality of task outcomes. Our results describe ben-efits and limitations of categorized overviews and identify considerations for the structure of the categories.
The study identified seven tactics that searchers used and revealed a bias in the choice of pages viewed: When categorized overviews were present, fewer uncategorized pages were viewed. Enthusiasm for categorized over-views for many search tasks and users seem strong enough to warrant further research, refined designs, and more commercial implementations. Our results suggest that future studies may benefit from a longitudinal approach to analyze changes in tactics as searchers adapt to richer interfaces.

Finally, the study suggested or refined a set of eight design guidelines for categorized overview search inter-tects, and web developers because they provide guidance for the appropriate integration of visual overviews that investigate the challenges of exploratory search.

 Appendix The scenario and task used for the study:
Three interview questions were selected for coding and analysis: 1. Did the categorized overview change the way you searched? Can you describe an example? 2. Can you describe an example where the categorized overview [helped; OR hindered, frustrated or mislead  X  whichever not indicated in previous question]? 3. Did you notice any difference in how you used the categorized overview each time? Can you describe an example?
In question two, the object was to elicit feedback on whichever aspect (positive or negative) the participant did not mention when answering the first question.
