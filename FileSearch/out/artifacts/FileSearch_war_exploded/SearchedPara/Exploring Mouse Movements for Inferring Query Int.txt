 Clickthrough on search results have been successfully used to infer user interest and preferences, but are often noisy and potentially ambiguous. We explore the potential of a complementary, more sensitive signal  X  X ouse movements X  in providing insights into the intent behind a web search query. We report preliminary results of studying user mouse movements on search result pages, with the goal of infer-ring user intent -in particular, to explore whether we can automatically distinguish the different query classes such as navigational vs. informational. Our preliminary exploration confirms the value of studying mouse movements for user intent inference, and suggests interesting avenues for future exploration.

Inferring query intent is an important yet very difficult problem. While past studies have primarily focused on in-dicators such as clickthrough to disambiguate queries and attempt to infer the original user intent, we focus on the less explored area of using mouse movements to attempt to disambiguate, classify, and infer intent of queries. Previous work on mouse movements has shown a correlation between eye movement and mouse movements (e.g., [4]). In other work, researchers have shown the value of mouse movement tracking for usability analysis [3] and user activity track-ing [2]. However, we are not aware of prior work on us-ing mouse movements to automatically classify queries into broad classes such as navigational vs. informational or to infer and disambiguate query intent.

We hypothesize that mouse movements provide more in-formation about user X  X  interactions than only using clicks and page dwell time as indicators. For example, while the the classes. As a result, 102 (34%) of the 300 searches were labeled as navigational, 147 (49%) were labeled as informa-tional, and 51 (17%) were discarded as we did not have a reasonable way of labeling the corresponding  X  X orrect X  query intent. We observe that for navigational queries, users often go directly to the interested result (spending little time on reading); in contrast, for informational queries, users spend more time reading the result page, which tends to result in longer and more complex mouse trajectories. The trajectory statistics for the dataset are reported in Table 2.

Figure 1 shows the mouse trajectories of three naviga-tional queries for multiple users. Note that while queries  X  X eebo X  and  X  X acebook X  follow a relatively consistent pat-tern, the query  X  X spn X  exhibits a much more complex be-havior. This suggests that some queries that are commonly considered navigational (and may exhibit similar click pat-terns) actually result in quite different user behavior and result examination patterns.

Figure 2 shows the mouse trajectories of three informa-tional queries for multiple users. Note that while patterns for the first two queries are relatively consistent, where users examine multiple results before clicking, the third query  X  X bama X  is actually both informational and navigational  X  exhibiting mouse trajectory patterns of both types of queries for different users. This confirms our hypothesis that for queries with multiple possible intents mouse trajectories can disambiguate the intent.

Table 3 reports preliminary results on automatically clas-sifying a query intent into informational or navigational. As a baseline we use a simple classifier trained on click logs obtained from the MSN Search engine, implemented using decision trees and simple clickthrough features such as aver-age deliberation time and maximum fraction of clicks on any result, similar to those described in [1]. As we can see, even our simple mouse movement representation improves on the accuracy of server-side intent classification alone, and sug-gests promising directions for future work. We presented a preliminary exploration of using mouse
