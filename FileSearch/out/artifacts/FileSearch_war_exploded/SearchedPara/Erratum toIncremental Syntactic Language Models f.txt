 While this was the intended experimental configura-tion, subsequent to publication a re-examination of the experiment revealed that for the condition where the HHMM syntactic language model was used in addition to the n -gram language model (HHMM + n -gram), tuning was actually performed using a con-strained dev set of sentences with 1-40 words.
As a result of this error, the BLEU scores reported in Figure 9 do not represent directly comparable ex-perimental conditions, since the dev set used for tun-ing was different (sentences with 1-20 words for n -gram only versus sentences with 1-40 words for HHMM + n -gram).

Because the results are not comparable, the claims of statistically significant improvements to transla-comparable results, we re-ran the n -gram only con-figuration performing tuning with a constrained dev set of 1-40 words, to match the actual configuration that was used for the HHMM + n -gram configura-tion. A list of corrections is listed below.

 Figure 9 shows a statistically signifi-cant improvement to the BLEU score when using the HHMM and the n -gram LMs together on this reduced test set. Due to this slowdown, we tuned the parameters using a constrained dev set (only sentences with 1-40 words), and tested using a constrained devtest set (only sentences with 1-20 words).
 Figure 9 shows no statistically sig-nificant improvement to the BLEU score when using the HHMM and the n -gram LMs together on this reduced test set.  X  Section 7, sentence 5: The description of the experimental setup in Schwartz et al. (2011) contained an error that was discovered subsequent to publication. The descrip-tion stated that MERT was performed on a con-strained dev set of sentences with 1-20 words. In fact, one of the experimental conditions (HHMM + n -gram) was instead run on a constrained dev set of sentences with 1-40 words. This error has been cor-rected  X  after correction, no statistically significant improvement to translation quality is seen in terms of BLEU score. The error does not affect the origi-nally reported perplexity results.
