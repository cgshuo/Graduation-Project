 We study the recurrence dynamics of queries in Web search by analysing a large real-world query log dataset. We find that query frequency is more useful in predicting collective query recurrence whereas query recency is more useful in predicting individual query recurrence. Our findings pro-vide valuable insights for understanding and improving Web search.

What queries are are likely to recur? This question is crucial to the effective and efficient design of Web search engines. In this paper, we study the recurrence dynam-ics of queries, i.e., how people reuse their past queries, by analysing a large real-world query log dataset. Although there exists a lot of work in the analysis of Web query logs (such as [6]), the pattern of query recurrence is neither well-understood nor well-studied.
We use the AOL query log dataset [9] that is provided to the research community by AOL search engine 1 for our analysis. In this paper, we focus on the search events hap-pened within the first week of March 2006. Each search event is represented by a tuple ( u , q , t )whichmeansuser u issued query q at time t , and we sort all the search events by their time. The queries have already been normalised http://search.aol.com/ through punctuation-removal and case-folding etc. The fi-nal dataset used in this paper consists of 1 , 908 , 135 queries from 309 , 078 users.
We consider two settings of query recurrence:
For each incident of query recurrence (happened at time t ), we compute:
In each setting, we first rank a ll distinctive query recur-rence incidents according to their frequency or recency val-ues (in the collective or individual history), and then cal-culate the proportion of query recurrence incidents for each frequency or recency rank.

Figure 1(a) and 1(b) show the log-log plots of query re-currence proportion over query frequency and recency ranks respectively. We observe that in general, consistent with our intuition, (1) more frequently used queries are more likely to recur; and (2) more recently used queries are more likely to recur. More interestingly, the recurrence dynamics of queries in the two different settings exhibit drastically differ-ent characteristics: collectiv e query recurrence is dominated by query frequency, whereas individual query recurrence is dominated by query recency. Furthermore, the two nearly-straight lines in the below log-log plots suggest that, the relationship between quer y recurrence proportion p and its frequency rank r (in the collective setting) or its recency rank r (in the individual setting) roughly follows the power law [8]: p  X  1 /r  X  , where the corresponding scaling-exponent  X  is shown in Table 1.

We compute Kendall X  X  rank-correlation coefficient  X  [4] to quantitatively measure the utility of query frequency or recency in predicting query recurrence. Table 2 shows the values of  X  calculated over the top 100 query frequency or recency ranks. We see that in the collective setting query recurrence is correlated more s trongly with query frequency than recency, and in the individual setting query recur-rence is correlated more stron gly with query recency than frequency. Furthermore, query frequency and recency are indeed highly useful predictors for collective and individual query recurrence respectively, as reflected by the correspond-ing high  X  values (close to the perfect correlation score 1).

A close inspection of the query log reveals that the better performance of query recency i n predicting query recurrence on the individual level is mainly due to the greater burst and drift of user interests on the individual level.
In summary, according to our analysis based on the AOL query log dataset 2 , we find that query frequency is more use-ful in predicting collective query recurrence whereas query recency is more useful in predicting individual query recur-rence. Our findings provide valuable insights for the develop-ment of better query suggestion [7], information re-finding [10], and result caching/prefetching [5,1,2,3]techniques etc. Most notably, we point out that temporal factors such as query recency, which have been largely overlooked in ex-isting research, are actually very important to personalised Web search [6].

It would be necessary to confirm the findings on other query log datasets, but to the best of our knowledge all publicly available query log datasets (except the AOL one) do not contain user-id information because of privacy concerns.
