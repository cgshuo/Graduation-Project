 H.4.0 [ Information Systems Applications ]: General semantic matching, information retrieval
Recently, signi cant progress has been made in research on what we call semantic matching (SM), in web search, question answering, online advertisement, cross-language in-formation retrieval, and other tasks. Advanced technologies based on machine learning have been developed.

Let us take Web search as example of the problem that also pervades the other tasks. When comparing the textual content of query and documents, Web search still heavily re-lies on the term-based approach, where the relevance scores between queries and documents are calculated on the basis of the degree of matching between query terms and document terms. This simple approach works rather well in practice, partly because there are many other signals in web search (hypertext, user logs, etc.) that complement it. However, when considering the long tail of web searches, it can suf-fer from data sparseness, e.g., Trenton does not match New Jersey Capital . Query document mismatches occur when searcher and author use different terms (representations), and this phenomenon is prevalent due to the nature of hu-man language.

The fundamental reason for mismatch is that little lan-guage analysis is conducted in search. A more realistic ap-proach beyond bag-of-words, referred to as SM. The lat-ter conducts deeper query and document analysis to encode text with richer representations and then perform query-document matching with such representations by extracting and utilizing the semantic information, e.g., Trenton is the New Jersey Capital . For example, Google uses geograph-ical/administrative databases to derive such information. SM is expected to solve the query document mismatch chal-lenge.

The need for SM is particularly strong when we consider information retrieval tasks beyond query-document match-ing: for instance, successfully answering a complex informa-tional query demands not only retrieving a set of appropriate documents, but also aggregating and synthesizing the infor-mation in the documents, which is relevant for the query. For instance, Online Reputation Management [1] usually implies nding, understanding and aggregating thousands of facts, comments and opinions about an entity in order to understand threats to its reputation at a given point in time. This cannot be done without SM techniques.
SM can be extended to phrases or sentences. Indeed, there are initiatives such as the semantic textual similarity (STS) evaluation campaign [2], which go beyond term level match-ing and aim at capturing the semantic relations between entire phrases as well as those between entire sentences.
Approaches to semantic match have been recently devel-oped for web search [4] and question answering [3], e.g., query reformulation, term dependency model, translation model, topic modeling, kernel methods, latent space model, deep learning. Additionally, semantic resources such as Wiki-pedia, DBpedia, and so on have been explored to enable matching between common-knowledge concepts and/or en-tities, e.g., Barrack Obama and President , as well as Apple and Cupertino Company .

Given the complexity of the task, there are many chal-lenging or unknown issues, especially when natural language processing (NLP) methods are applied to IR applications. Future research topics may include developments of new and advanced algorithms, novel metrics and procedures for eval-uation, sophisticated methods of data creation and collec-tion, innovative methods of combination with traditional IR and NLP technologies, real-time large scale NLP, and novel and useful applications.
