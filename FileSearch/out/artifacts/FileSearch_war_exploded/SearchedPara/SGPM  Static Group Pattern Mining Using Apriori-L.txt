 Modern society is increasingly adopting mobile phones [15]. Mobile phone is mobile user. As mobile phones now can be personalized and tracked [3, 14], it opens background, places visited, and details of the places visited. patterns and knowledge from mobile users. Data mining have since been applied into sequential patterns [2]. 
Group pattern [17, 18] developed by Wang et al. is useful in determining grouping proximity among mobile users. This is a method which becomes a limitation when the size of total number of mobile users through the time horizon becomes large, leading to complex dataset and reduced efficiency. The rationale behind group pattern is such can be deemed as close socially [6]. 
In real life mobile environment there are obstacles, which will be termed as static move in the mobile environment. For example, walls, doors, phone booths, floors are between two mobile users in order to determine their social proximity, the weakness pattern there really is. This is because people separated by a wall are principally not close together. Data source for group pattern [17, 18] mining is a user movement database defined by called a valid segment of G, if 4. ( t b  X  t a + 1)  X  min_dur ; points, i.e., d ( u i [ t ]. p , u j [ t ]. p ) = 
Consider the user movement database in Table 1. For min_dur = 3 and max_dis = 10, [5,8] is a valid segment of the set of users, {u2, u4}. min_dur, we say that G, max_dis and min_dur form a group pattern , denoted by P = &lt; G, max_dis, min_dur &gt;, if G has a valid segment . In the interest of space, algorithm AGP [17, 18] is not shown. Valid segments of the with k users is also known as k-group pattern . In a user movement database, a group valid segments is called the weight count of the pattern. We quantify the significance of the pattern by comparing its weight count with the overall time duration. the number of time points in the database, the weight of P is defined as : segments {[1,3], [6,8]} and its weight is 6/10  X  0.5. problem of finding all the valid group patterns (or simply valid groups) is known as valid group (pattern) mining . Group pattern [17, 18] mining is defined in Section 2. This proposal proposes a way means more calculation, and also Eucilidean distance is prone to problems where two mobile users are separated by an obstacle, such as a wall. In this paper, we focuses on proposed and addressed in another contribution. and location. In the previous proposed group pattern, data is collected as a stream for and immense amount of source data to be mined. Consider each mobile user generates times. Data source for group pattern mining is a user movement database defined by are known at every time point and the interval between t and t +1 is fixed. determine its position in earth, or otherwise determine which room the mobile device is located in a shopping mall. Assumption 2. Given a mobile device  X  , it is assumed that  X  is equipped with brief environment, and subsequently records down the user movement activity accordance when the recording facility is full, for mobile user data mining. Definition 5 (Location of Interest). Given a mobile device  X  , duration threshold  X  known as location of interest ( LOI ). t and storage space, user movement data is not recorded if the mobile user moving at a t = t Definition 7 (Movement Data Format). Recording of user movement database will t t a1 in sequence . We define each of this record r n . t t is known as valid group (pattern) mining . t each pass. 
Next pass for the sliding window is to slide the window one step forward, and now defined in the group pattern definition paper. Figure 2 illustrates.

Support for maximal itemset ( m 4  X  m 7  X  m 8  X  m 10 ) is 3. Support for ( m 4  X  m 7  X  m In the interest of space, we do not show how this problem is dealt in this paper. Algorithm Sliding-Window Input: User movement database grouped by area a n , variable t threshold Output: m record of mobile users who is present in the whole sliding window 01 result =  X  ; 02 S width = t threshold ; // defining width of sliding window 04 for ( m i = 1; m i  X  m j ; m ++) do begin 07 append ( result , m i ); 08 end for 09 end for 10 end for 11 return result ; 
Figure 5 represents algorithm Sliding-Window where the sliding window is defined database. In order for a mobile user to be recorded, a mobile user must be within the times, it will be recorded for AGSP algorithm. Algorithm AGSP Input: result from algorithm Sliding-Window , support threshold Output: List supported itemsets 01 R 1 = {large r -itemsets} // R gathered from result 02 for ( k =2; R k-1  X   X  ; k ++) do begin 03 R k = apriori-gen( R k-1 ); 04 for all transactions t  X  R do begin 05 R t = subset ( R k , t) 06 for all candidates r  X  R t do begin 07 r .count++; 08 R k = { r  X  R k | r . count  X  support threshold } 09 return R k ; 
Figure 6 shows the algorithm AGSP where the result from Sliding-Window no further combinations can be generated, and the resulting output is a combination of from Sliding-Window algorithm. shows evidence of them being close together frequently enough within the same area ( m formula of confidence = ( m i ,  X  ...  X  , m j ) / ( m i ,  X  ...  X  , m j ). movement database on a Pentium IV machine with a CPU clock rate of 2.8 Ghz, and memory so that it represents execution time without bottlenecks from disk access. We compare the time it requires AGP algorithm and ASGP algorithm to access from user patterns. 5.1 Dataset Since real dataset are not available, we have implemented a synthetic user movement T10.I4.D1000 . Fig 8 represents the input parameters, where D represents the number maximal potentially large item sets. 5.2 Results T5.I4.D1000, and T10.I4.D1000 respectively. It can be observed that on all occasions, algorithm ASGP takes shorter time to generate valid group patterns. When the support generate result, because there are very limited amount of candidates in the dataset for number of potential candidates becomes larger and larger. ASGP takes a shorter time because support is low, and there are many potential candidates, and more processing moderate sized dataset. Group Pattern Mining ( SGPM ). The objective of this research work is to address the bottlenecks of AGP algorithm. Instead of using Eucilidean distance and calculate the problem and addressing obstacle issues in the mobile environment.
