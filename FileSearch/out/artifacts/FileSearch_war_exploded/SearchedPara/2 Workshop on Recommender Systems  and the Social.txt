 challenges, and presents opportunities for Recommender System research. The Social Web has turned information consumers into active contributors who generate large volumes of rapidly changing online data. Recommender Systems strive to identify relevant content for users at the right time and in the right context the volume and nature of information contributed through the Social Web. systems encourage users to implicitly and explicitly provide large volumes of information which prev iously they would have been reluctant to share. This informa tion includes personal details such as location, age, and interest s, friendship networks, bookmarks and tags, opinion and preferences which can be captured explicitly or more often by monitoring user interaction with the systems (e.g. commenting, fri ending, rating,tagging etc). Recommender Systems to impr ove existing techniques and develop new strategies which fo cus on social recommendation. In turn recommender technologies can play a huge part in fuelling the success of the Social Web phenomenon by reducing the information overload problem f acing social media users. researchers and practitioners to explore, discuss, and understand challenges and new opportunities for Recommender Systems and the Social Web. The workshop consisted both of technical ongoing research, as well as informal breakout sessions on more focused topics. the Social Web were submitted and selected for presentation and discussion in the workshop in a formal reviewing process.
