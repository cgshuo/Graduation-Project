 Abstract. Relational database management systems have been widely used over decades. An important research issue is to find hidden struc-tural information in large relational databases. By hidden structural in-formation we mean the information that cannot be easily found using a traditional query language SQL. In this talk, we discuss how to find hidden structural information in a relational database by viewing a re-lational database as a large directed graph where nodes represent tuples and edges represent foreign key references between tuples in the data-base. We discuss how to find trees and communities in such a large graph for user-given keywords. We also discuss how to find frequent and addi-tional keywords associated with the structures identified in a relational database using SQL.
