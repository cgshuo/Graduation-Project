 Sexuality is part of human everyday life behaviors and human information behaviors. Human Internet sexuality is a growing area of research in the social science. In cyber space, the seeking of sexual information is known as an important human element of everyday life information seeking, as shown by the comprehensive study about the nature and characteristics of human information searching for sexual information point with high confidence based on our years of observation and experience. 
However, this doesn X  X  mean that sexual information should be accessible by all cleaner cyber environment. To do so, there are two possible approaches: Even with the second solution, there are two options at the search engine side: are going to discuss here. 
On our search engine, we take the second option, i.e. suggest some non-porn choices if a query is recognized as porn type, based on the following consideration: 
Even though we know the potential advantage of recognizing a porn query, how to becomes more severe on Chinese search engine as we are engaging with. For exam-different target when appear in different context:  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  refers to the Chinese army, but  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X , based on our operation experience, is about gay images in most cases. Therefore, we can X  X  simply determine if a query is porn or not via simply even though a query is all composed of non-porn or non-sensitive words, it still will nese pornographic star). Manual checking of such queries is possible, but the cost will be terribly expensive considering the huge number of queries being issued every day. 
The primary contribution of this paper is four-folder: section 4. We end with brief conclusion and potential future work in section 5. 2.1 Motivation and Overall Introduction as related even though no single term is shared between them, e.g.  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  (gay image) and  X   X  X  X  X   X   X  (porn novel). However, the traditional similarity measures, such as the vector support model (VSM) with cosine coefficient as the basic distance measure [10], fail to achieve this goal, yielding a similarity of 0. Even in cases where two queries may share terms, e.g.  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  (gay image) and  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  (com-rade army), they, in fact, refers to completely different meaning although their cosine coefficient is 0.5 due to the shared lexical term  X   X  X  X   X . So, whether sharing term(s) or not is not a trustable indication of relatedness between queries. 
To address this problem, we need a more reasonable as well as reliable measure about the closeness among queries, referring more comprehensive information about the queried targets, instead of simple term-wise happenings. Fortunately, the web and modern search engine helps us to leverage the large volume of pages on the web to determine the greater context for a query in an efficient and effective manner. those words that tend to co-occur with the original query, so it can be viewed as the corresponding context of the query, providing us more semantic background informa-tion. Then, the comparison of queries beco mes the comparison of their corresponding this method to determine the similarity between more objects on the Web [9]. 2.2 Formalizing the Approach following sequential steps: 1. Issue the query q to a search engine; similarity between two queries is defined as: ple,  X   X  X  X   X  (Roboo Inc., the company providing mobile search service in China) and  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  (mobile search) are determined closely related, but they are known as obviously not related if look at the terms composed only. Reversely,  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  and  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X re judged as non-related since they indeed refer to completely different concepts, though they share one same term,  X   X  X  X   X . 3.1 Why k-NN? Being a classical method, the k-Nearest Neig hbor (k-NN) algorithm classifies objects deferred until classification. [11,12]. 
Like any other classification approach, the application of k-NN is composed of two feature space. Distances from the new vector to all stored vectors are computed and k closest samples are selected. The most comm on class among the k-selected neighbors is assigned to this new instance, simulating the democratic voting. 
Given the binary classification problem, porn or non-porn query, we choose k-NN, instead of other classifiers, based on the following points: 2. The proposed semantic distance measure completely complies the computa-3. Few training samples are enough to get a satisfactory classification model based 5. More classes can be added and become effective right now, and this just We believe the potential merits of k-NN are not limited to these, and more discussion is left to interesting readers. covered with more details. 3.2 Training Phase Figure 1 demonstrates the training stage of this proposed approach in sequence: vector. 3.3 Classification Phase There are a number of ways to classify the ne w vector to a particular class, and one of amongst the k nearest neighbors. A major drawback to using this technique to classify a new vector to a class is that the more frequent examples tend to dominate the pre-diction of the new vector, as they tend to come up in the k nearest neighbors when the neighbors are computed due to their large number. One of the ways to overcome this problem is to take into account the distan ce of each k nearest neighbors with the new vector of the query being studied, and predict its class based on these summed relative distances. 
How a query is classified into porn or non-porn category by k-NN with semantic measure is shown in Figure 2: So, we determine if a query is porn or not based on its relative distance with respect to the porn and non-porn feature sub-space (Figure 3). 4.1 Design of Experiments The primary goal of our empirical study is on the effectiveness of the proposed solu-repository. 
To train the model, 200 queries were selected manually from the query log, includ-ing 100 most frequently appearing porn queries and 100 most frequent non-porn and the average length of the feature vector is 1,619 terms. 
Then, a number of queries are selected randomly from the query log of page, image and video channels respectively, and they play as the test cases in this study. 4.2 Data Analysis We select testing queries from three differ ent repositories (channel), i.e. page, image and video, and the same trained k-NN model using data from page search log is used. The corresponding summary information of selected testing queries is presented in number of porn query, number of non-porn query and number of pseudo non-porn currently, e.g.  X   X   X  X  X  X  (pretty nurse) X . 
Five persons are employed to label each query independently, and their opinion is summarized at the end. The primary rule for such labeling is whether most results restricted to the mobile cyber environment of China (i.e. WAP sites only), which may be somewhat different from that on traditional (wired) Internet. 
In Table 1, it is noted that, (1) the average length of query on mobile search is quite this project. 
The threshold value of score,  X  , to classify if a query is porn or not is set as 1.0, 3.0 and 2.0 for page, image and video channel respectively. Actually, this setting is arbi-trary, and different value may result in different statistics. Our choices are based on a any bias, we filter out the pseudo non-porn queries here to make the study easier. 
For each channel, we also collect the statistics of precision and recall for both porn and non-porn queries, as shown in Table 3. The definition of precision and recall are given below with porn query as example, but it applies to the calculation of non-porn query as well: 4.3 Discussion From Table 2, and 3, the following conclusions can be made: In this paper, a novel porn query recognition approach is proposed so that some nec-context; (2) content independent so that workable to non-text content, like image and video; (3) effective in recognizing a porn query, even it has no porn term at all appar-discussed with enough detail, and experiments with real Web and query data indicate that it is an effective, even though surprisingly simple, method. clude a possible solution here: missing, the online waiting for the extraction of feature vector won X  X  be long. Consid-time, this procedure won X  X  bring annoying effect to the users. 
Several future work stay in our project list, including:
