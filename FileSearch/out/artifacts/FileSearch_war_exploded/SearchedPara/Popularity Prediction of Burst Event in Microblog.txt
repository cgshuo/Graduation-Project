 Every day, many news events are even first reported in microblogging sites, such as the event  X  X urricane Sandy hitting New York in Oct 2012 X  was extensively reported by Twitter users. It is very interest to predict how popular the event will be. Analyz-ing the spread of burst event is very important in many fields. There have been many works on modeling information spread of social media stream. These works can be categorized into two groups. One group of works focus on the topology of social graph, investigating what topologies and what activation patterns facilitate efficient propagation of information [2], [3], [5]. However, in many scenarios, the underlying network is in fact implicit or even unknown. The other category of researches mainly [4].These approaches have no consideration on different users X  affection, which make them depend heavily on the analyzing of content features in a macro-level. We model the spread of the event based on the analysis of event content and users X  social rela-tion information. Our approach doesn X  X  require the complete topology of social net-work to be known. To accomplish this, a li near spread prediction function, based on information, is proposed to predict the popularity of the event in the next time point. Given a continuous stream of incoming micro-blogs, we split it use a time unit with a given length l . We define the volume, V e ( t ), as the number of micro-blogs that discuss lume V e ( t +1) in the next time unit as a linear function: a signature that, once this user adopts an event, how many other users will be infected by this user to adopt the event and then how many new micro-blogs will be produced, by its historical popularity, In ( t ) denotes the set of already infected users and t u is the time when user u is infected. The key problem is how to estimate the parameters, i.e., Sim ( u , e ), F u ( d ), and H e ( t+ 1). 
Usually, a user X  X  interest is reflected by the micro-blogs that are uploaded by this user in the past. Thus, we aggregate all the micro-blogs generated by the same indi-vidual user into a profile that corresponds to a document in the LDA model. Then, each user X  X  interest is modeled by a vector of probability distribution over latent top-ics as: in user u  X  X  profile, and it is estimated using the Gibbs sampling rule. In the other side, we aggregate some hot micro-blogs selected from the event into an event profile. of the event profile. Finally, the cosine similarity between the probability distribution vectors of event profile and user profile is used to measure user X  X  interest in the event. 
The introduced volume H e ( t+ 1) is produced by the historical popularity informa-tion. The Newton interpolation is applied to estimate the introduced volume as fol-lows: where 0  X  a  X  t is a index number which indicates the start time point from which the volume values is used in the Newton interpolation equation, and I i is the index of the time unit. 
We use the approach that is similar to the one used in the previous model [5] to in-and data about M different events spread in the network over time. Each event can event e m at time unit t is represented as follows: where D denotes the amount of time units, meaning that the influence power of a user record T volume values of T sequential time units for each event. As there are M different events, the number of these volume equations denoted by Eq. (3) is M  X  T . To infer these parameters, we can represent these equations in a matrix form: where V influence power vector of length U  X  D , H weighted by the parameter vector  X  . Now, the parameters can be inferred by solving a the prediction error measured by the Euclid ean distance between the true and the pre-dicted volumes of the events: To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct a set of experiments on a datasets collected from Sina Weibo . Sina Weibo recommends 10 hottest topics in its website every day. We collected about 4,137,892 micro-blogs and 159,782 users be-tween January 2012 and July 2012. The total number of collected event is 678. The metric of relative error is used to evaluate the performance of prediction: where TV m ( t +1) is the true volume of event m at time unit t +1. We compare our ap-proach (named EventPRE ) with HTall [1] and BassPre [4] respectively. 
In the first experiment, we test the effect of parameter D on the performance of prediction. Fig.1. shows the relative error of our approach with D varied from 1 to 7, which shows that our approach achieve the best performance when the length of D is period, which may decrease his influence power and hence affect the prediction. user X  X  influence power. 
Then, we analyze the effect of time unit length l on the prediction performance and compare the performance of different approaches. Fig.2. shows the relative errors of different approaches. It shows that our approach outperform other two approaches consistently. This is because that our approach uses users X  interest information to distinguish different users X  contributions in the spread of event, while other approach-popularity information in previous time units is also used in our approach. It also shows that all the approaches achieve better prediction as the length of time unit grows. This can be attributed to the deceas ed standard deviation of event volumes. In this paper, we present a novel approach predict the spread of burst event in online communities. Compared to other approaches, our approach needn X  X  to know the com-plete topology. Moreover, we proposed a revised author-topic model to mine user X  X  interest which is neglected by other appro aches. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other approaches. This task is very interesting from both commercial and psychological perspectives. Acknowledgements.
