This paper defines an evaluation phrase (EP) to be an elementary linguistic unit that refers to successive words, conveying an attitude towards some target. It could be a single word, successive words, or even a sentence, For example,  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X ( English translation: very convenient ) and  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X ( English translation: extremely boring ). EP contains abundant emotional information, from which we then could derive useful features for machine learning. Besides, EP not only contributes to detecting sentiment, but also could help people understand the corresponding event comprehensively, as the result of information extraction. 
In the study of [3], the concept of appraisal groups was first proposed, which de-notes coherent groups of words that express together a particular attitude. Evaluative 
Considering the efficiency of both statistical and rule-based extraction, as well as the difficulty of manually labeling corpus, we define and extract simple evaluation phrase composed of both of them. 
SEP mainly refers to the collocation of degree adverbs and evaluative words. And it plement etc.). The underlined parts below are SEP examples. In our cascaded model, a SEP can be used as an EP alone, and also be absorbed in a CEP after rule-based ex-tension described in Section 5. Example 1.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  changed a lot . ) Example 2.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  ( English translation: making the Interior more elegant and luxury . ) 
Many related works only focused on the simple collocation of adverb and appraisal which are in complicated structure in the text, and they also reflect abundant opinion and the recognition of comparative sentences has become an important task in recent SEPs as follows. Example 3: CEP  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  ( English transla- X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X ( English translation: the new headlight ) and  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X ( English translation: stylish and dynamic ). opinion analysis [7, 8]. However, the combination of evaluation phrase and comment target truly determinates the sentiment polarity, rather than only considering the sen-timent of evaluation phrase. So this paper does not discuss and use any dictionary in subsequent tasks, such as comment target extraction and sentiment analysis. 
This paper focuses on product reviews, though our method could apply to a broad-evaluation phrase as shown in Fig. 1: (1) splits input sentence into segments (defined nally, results from (2) and (3) are the evaluation phrases that we want to extract. lated work. Section 3 gives an overview of data description and related concepts. We rule-based method for extracting the CEP in Section 5. In Section 6, experiments and results of the method on Chinese automobile review corpus are presented. Section 7, finally, concludes the paper. est, and various studies have been conducted for extraction and classification of eva-luative information. 
In the research domain of sentiment analysis, the study of [3] considered that, the analyzing appraisal groups. Wilson et al. [9] presented a method to phrase-level sen-timent analysis based on subjective expression. Extraction patterns were also used in classification based on compositional semantics analysis. They state that the meaning rules by which they are combined. dictionaries. Inspired by this work, Wang et al. [13] constructed statistical method to cently have been several tasks about Chinese opinion information extraction, such as COAE (2008-2013) and Chinese micro-blog evaluation task of CCF (2012-2013), attracting increasing attention. This paper focuses on product reviews, though our method applies to a broader range of opinions. We employ the proposed method to extract Chinese evaluation phrase in the domain of automobile. Unfortunately, there is no annotated Chinese review corpus of automobile publicly available. To train and test the proposed method, we designed reviews from Tencent Automobile 1 , Netease Automobile 2 and Phoenix Automobile 3 in Table 1, and symbol #X represents total number of X . To simplify the description, this paper defines following concepts: Segment : the entire sentence is separated into many segments by the punctuations. For example,  X   X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X ( English translation: Through parts). We process only one segment and extract EPs from it every time. the following segment is a word collocation of adjective . 
Current word X  X  neighborhood with radius R : the consecutive word collocation 
This paper uses the standard of POS tags of NLPIR. The following table explains the symbols in rules which will be proposed in Section 5. 4.1 The Introduction of CRFs In [14], Conditional Random Felds (CRFs) are discriminative models and could thus capture many correlated features of the inputs. CRFs have a single exponential model for the joint probability of the entire paths given by the input sentence, and minimize sequence data is a simple chain as Fig. 2.  X  X   X   X   X   X ,  X   X ,...,  X   X  represents the observed sequence of input data and  X  X   X   X  the sequence of states is shown as the following formula: learned from the training data and indicates the weight of the corresponding  X   X  . When CRFs model is defined by formula (1) and the sequence of input data  X  is given, we use formula (2) to obtain the most likely label sequence with a method similar to Vi-terbi algorithm in Hidden Markov Models (HMM). 4.2 The Extraction of SEP Based on CRFs the extraction as a sequence labeling problem , and employs CRFs model to recognize (  X  -th word) and its POS tag, respectively. 
This paper chooses to use B/I/O tagging method [15] to label corpus. Wherein the belongs to no SEP. 
For example, after Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging, the segment,  X 2012/m  X  /q  X  X  /nz  X  /ude1  X  X  X  /vn  X  /d  X  /vshi  X  X  X  /d  X  X  X  /a  X  /ude1 X  ( English translation: 2012 side skirt X  X  change is very subtle ), is labeled as follows: 2012 /m/ B  X  /q/ I  X  X  /nz/ I  X  /ude1/ I  X  X  X  /vn/O  X  /d/O  X  /vshi/O  X  X  X  /d/ B  X  X  X  /a/ I  X  /ude1/ I . 
This segment contains two SEPs:  X 2012  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  ( English translation: 2012 side into a single-word, and its POS tag is set as EP , as follows: 2012  X  X  X  X  X  X  / EP  X  X  X  /vn  X  /d  X  /vshi  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  /EP. The methods described in this section are based on the extraction results from Section 4, and final EPs are generated after using such rule-based methods. 
On account of the characteristics of Chinese grammar and syntax, this paper sum-marizes three complex structure rules: parenthesis phrase rule, preposition phrase rule and adverb phrase rule. And each of them could be extended. 5.1 Parenthesis Phrase Rule mation, such content could be extracted as an EP. And it modifies the comment target the corresponding comment target is the word collocation of noun on the left. 5.2 Preposition Phrase Rule Simple preposition phrase often fails to express an emotional tendency. But combined with complement behind, it could do it. Although the internal structure of such phrase is complex, it is also easy to design rules due to its significant boundary features and context features. 
For each segment, we search for preposition from right to left. After finding out a following rules, we extract them (including the preposition itself) as a EP. Continue to search for preposition and repeat above process, until reaching the leftmost end. bols appearing in rules are described in Section 3: Rule 1: p + n + EP these words into a single-word, and reset the POS tag as EP . 
Example.  X  X  /n  X  /f  X  /d  X  /v  X  /p  X  X  X  /nz  X  X  X  /n  X  X  /EP ( English translation: The appearance is tougher than that of Trumpchi sedan ) 
The extracted CEP is  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  ( English translation: is tougher than that of Trumpchi sedan ). Rule 2: p + n + d + v 
Description: If there is word collocation of n oun, word collocation of adverb and tion and these words into a single-word, and reset the POS tag as EP . 
Example:  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  /EP  X  X  /nz  X  X  X  /nz  X  /p  X  X  X  X  /nz LOGO/x  X  X  /ad  X  X  X  /vn ( English translation: Layered chrome grille fuses Citro X n LOGO cleverly ) 
The extracted CEP is  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  LOGO  X  X  X  X  X   X  ( English translation: fuses Ci-tro X n LOGO cleverly ). Other rules are shown in Table 4: 
There are some methods to extend above basic rules: 1) The word collocation of noun in the ru les can be replaced by word collocation of pronoun, and the rules are still valid. rules in some ways. For example, add the word marked EP before the word colloca-tion of noun: p+n+v  X  p+EP+n+v . 3) Some Chinese words, such as  X   X  X  X   X  and  X   X  X  X   X , are able to indicate compara-tive relationship. The preposition in the rules can be replaced by such words, and the rules are still valid. 5.3 Adverb Phrase Rule gree adverbs ( X   X  X  X   X ,  X   X   X  etc.) could indicate the tone and attitude of speaker. 
This paper mainly focuses on the condition that the adverb phrase is used as predi-extract words complying with above description as EP. This paper proposes six basic adverb phrase rules as follows. Rule 1: d + v + EP 
Description: If there is word collocation of verb and the word marked EP sequen-tially on the right side of this adverb, we concatenate both this adverb and these words into a single-word, and reset the POS tag as EP . 
Example.  X  X  X  /nz  X  /d  X  /v  X  X  X  X  X  X  /EP ( English translation: interior is fairly simple and generou s ) 
The extracted CEP is  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ( English translation: is fairly simple and generous ). Rule 2: d + EP concatenate this adverb and the EP into a single-word, and reset the POS tag as EP . 
Example.  X  X  /n  X  X  X  /d  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  /EP ( English translation: Manufacturer only does certain adjustments for body sur-rounded . ) 
The extracted CEP is  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ( English translation: only does certain adjustments for body surrounded ). 
Other rules are shown in the following table, and the basic rules could also be ex-tended by using the methods mentioned above. This section conducted experiments to confirm the effectiveness of proposed method. comment target and opinion holder), including our work, is available online 7 . 6.1 The Measurement of Extraction F-measure (F) . 
Where  X   X  is the total number of annotated EPs/SEPs/CEPs in the standard testing among the extraction results. Meanwhile, we implement three criteria as follows [13], and the last two ones are also called lenient match : standard one. It is also called strict match . dard one. 
Span partial match: if span of extracted phrase and span of standard one overlaps, span coverage is added to the number of correctly extracted results. 6.2 Results According to the measurements in Section 6.1, the methods described in Sections 4 and experiments and record the mean. The detailed performance information is shown in Table 6. The figures of SEP extraction are for the best combination of the features in SEP extraction. 
As shown in Table 6, For SEP, both the precision and recall of exact match are rel-atively high. Because SEP X  X  composition is regular and its grammatical elements are Even for sample data, there are thousands of methods to select features, but not all of current word and its POS tag respectively. 
According to Table 7, performance of SEP extraction doesn X  X  improve with fea-neighborhood is 3 (5 th template in boldface). This is mainly because SEP X  X  characte-ristics can X  X  guarantee the validity of the features, and the performance might also be limited to the scale of corpus. 
Let X  X  turn to Table 6 again. For CEP and EP, the performances of exact match are corpus because some technical details were not revealed in the papers. But this paper mance, because the task and concept definitions among ours are close. 
As shown in Table 8, the figures are taken from their papers. Especially, we choose could conclude that our recall is higher than previous work and the precision, which is an important metric in practice, is also competitive. experiments, the proposed method was demonstrated that it could achieve reasonably good performance, especially compared with previous works. formation extraction [13], and we will utilize such information in the future. Besides, the proposed work mainly focuses on formal writing style, and we will do more expe-riments and developments on diverse writing styles. Acknowledgements.
