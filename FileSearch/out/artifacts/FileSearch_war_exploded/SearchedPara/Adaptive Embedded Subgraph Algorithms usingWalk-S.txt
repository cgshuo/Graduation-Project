 walk-sums appears to be critical to this analysis. Therefore, our methods are broadly applicable beyond estimation in Gaussian models. involving communication  X  X ailure X  between nodes for distributed sensor network applications. Let G = ( V, E ) be a graph with vertices V , and edges E  X  V information form [5] p ( x )  X  exp { X  1 J 1 our analysis and algorithms can be easily generalized to the un-normalized case [10]. 2.1 Walk-sums of the graph G . For Gaussian processes defined on graphs, element R vertices { w We then have that ( R ` ) point of view, we can interpret J  X  1 as follows: of all such walks is finite). Thus, ( J  X  1 ) to have the following interpretation in walk-summable models: the walks (such as in (2)). In words, ( J  X  1 ) and x definite information/covariance.
 which plays a key role in walk-sum analysis. Let u = u with u Now consider a walk-set U with all walks ending at u beginning at v 2.2 Embedded Trees algorithm of the entries of J corresponding to edges in S are assigned to J part of K Based on this splitting, we can transform (1) to J J b offers an effective method to solve (1) (assuming % ( J  X  1 with each iteration, then we obtain the following non-stationary ET iteration: where {S choice of the subgraph S Figure 1: (Left) G and three embedded trees S choice of subgraphs {S complication with the ET algorithm is that the matrix J never arises in walk-summable models with J in Therefore, J Consider the following recursively defined set of walks for s, t  X  V : with W and  X  denotes concatenation of walk-sets as described previously. The set W denotes a length-1 walk (called a hop ) across an edge in E\S in which hop across an edge in E\S term W ( s S n  X  X  X  t ) denotes walks from s to t that only live within S the ET algorithm at iteration n . For simplicity, we denote  X  ( W Proposition 1 Let b x (0) = 0 . Then, We note that the classic Gauss-Jacobi algorithm [6], a stationary iteration with J can be interpreted as a walk-sum algorithm: right, and corresponds to an ET iteration based on the subgraphs S the left). Each level n in the diagram consists of the subgraph S in computed by the ET algorithm in theorem for which we only provide a brief sketch of the complete proof [10]. Theroem 1 Let 0 . Then, Proof outline : Proving this statement is done in the following stages. Validity : The walks in W Nesting : The walk-sets W Completeness : Let w  X  W ( s  X  t ) .

These convergence results motivate maximum reduction in error after K iterations. The experiment with non-walk-summable models
