 In microblog like Twitter , popular tweets are usually retweet-ed by many users. For different tweets, their lifespans (i.e., how long they will stay popular) vary. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to predict the lifespans of popular tweets based on their static characteristics and dy-namic retweeting patterns. For a potentially popular tweet, we generate a time series based on its first-hour retweeting information, and compare it with those of historic tweet-s of the same author and post time (at the granularity of hour). The top-k historic tweets are identified, whose mean lifespan is estimated as the lifespan of the new tweet. Our experiments on a three-month real data set from Tencent Microblog demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Nowadays, microblog has become one of the most popular social network services, used by billions of people all over the world. In microblog, popular information usually spreads incredibly rapidly through users X  retweeting behaviors. Pre-dicting tweets X  popularity is desirable for a large scope of applications like burst events detection, microblog advertise-ment and real-time recommendation, etc. Such popularity prediction involves two issues: 1) how popular a tweet will be (i.e., popularity degree) and 2) how long a tweet will s-tay popular (i.e., popularity lifespan). A bundle of research has recently been carried on to address the first issue. Hong et al. [2] predicted tweets X  popularity using a classification method. Cui et al. [1]proposedanHF-NMFapproachto predict how many friends of a user in a Facebook-like social network service would share the same content as the user forwarded.

This paper examines the second issue, aiming to predic-t lifespans of tweets in microblog. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to address the predic-tion problem of tweets X  lifespans. Different from traditional microblog analysis methods, we do not focus on semantic un-posted at 5 pm. 2) Author of the tweet. Different microblog users have different followers with diverse characteristics in terms of retweeting behavior, active involvement, follower composition, interest, etc. We gather historic tweets with the same author and post time as the one to be predicted.
Second, top-k historic tweets are found from the can-didate tweet set based on the similar dynamic retweeting pattern. To do that, we partition the first one hour in-to N number of equal time intervals, where N =2 n +1 ( n =0 , 1 ,... ). We then count the retweeting amount of the tweet during each time interval. The tweet X  X  retweet-ing amounts at consecutively different time intervals thus formulate a time series RT S = RC 1 ,RC 2 ,...,RC N .
The distance between two time series is defined as the Eu-clidian distance:
Note that influential time intervals with more contribution to the similarity could be picked up and enforced with dif-ferent weights here. For instance, we could pick up the first, middle, and last time intervals of RT S , RC 1 ,RC n ,RC 2 n +1 , to characterize the retweeting trend of the tweet.
Third, after obtaining the top-k similar historic tweets {
T 1 ,T 2 ,...,T k } , their mean lifespan is calculated as the es-timated lifespan of the tweet to be predicted:
We evaluated our lifespan prediction approach on the real data set from Tencent Microblog. We collected the retweet-ing information of all the tweets from October 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, and filtered out potentially unpopular tweets whose first-hour retweeting amounts are less than 100. We took the tweets of the first two months, total 229666, as the historic tweet set, and the tweets of the third month, total 118471, as the test set.

The Root Mean Square Error ( RMSE )isusedasthe evaluation metric. The smaller RMSE is, the better the performance is. Let X be the total number of tweets for prediction, Lif eSpan p ( T i )and Lif eSpan t ( T i ) be the pre-dicted and real lifespan of the i -th tweet.

The value of k is set to 5, because our experiments show that the improvement is not obvious when k is over 5. fhrc ( first-hour retweeting count ) is the retweeting amount of a tweet during the first hour after it is posted.
The Q-Q plot [3] of the predicted lifespan and real lifespan is shown in Fig.1. As illustrated in Fig.1, the distribution of predicted lifespan matches that of the real lifespan well, especially when the lifespan lasts for 20-40 hours. Due to the insufficient number of historic tweets and the average method, the predicted value is less than the real one for tweets with over 50-hour lifespan in the data set, which will be considered in our future work.

We further compare our approach with three baseline al-gorithms, which are kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), SVR (Sup-port Vector Regression), and LR (Linear Regression). ATR-kNN approach considers identical author, similar post time and retweeting pattern, AR-kNN approach considers iden-tical author and retweeting pattern, and TR-kNN approach
