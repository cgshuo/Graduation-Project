 In recent years, social media has become one of the most popular tools for discovering and following breaking news and ongoing events. However tools and interfaces have lagged behind users X  expectations, with current tools making it dif-ficult to discover new events and failing to provide a solution to the problem of information overload. We have developed an interactive interface for visualizing events, backed by a state-of-the-art event detection approach, which is able to detect, track and summarize events in real-time. Our inter-face provides up-to-the-second information about ongoing events in an easy to understand manner, including category information, temporal distribution, and location informa-tion  X  all of which was previously unobtainable in real-time. H.5.0 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Gen-eral Event Detection; Event Visualization; Social Media
The use of social media as a source of information about ongoing real-world events has exploded in recent years. Jour-nalists have turned to social media as a tool for finding events which have yet to be reported elsewhere, whilst other users are trying to follow ongoing events for up-to-the-second information about what is happening. The demands of users have changed greatly, however the interfaces and tools to provide event-based information have lagged behind, remain-ing mostly the same for a number of years. Some attempts have been made to improve this, however these have been aimed mostly at detecting events [3], notifying users of spe-cific types of event (such as emergency events [4]) or pro-viding specific types of information about an event (such a spacio-temporal information [2, 1]). There has yet to be a cards are ranked by a number of features, with the highest ranking and most popular events allowed more space at the top of the list, while smaller and less significant events are given a lesser presence.

Each of the events is classified into one of 7 categories using the uClassify API 2 , and users can browse events by category or by time period. Additionally, TweetDesk is able to filter events based upon a users geographical location to provide more personalized results.
Clicking on an event card takes the user to the event X  X  summary page, as shown in Figure 2, and allows the user to view detailed information and content summaries for the specific event. The summaries page aims to provide the user with the latest and most useful information about an event, and provides an alternative to reading hundreds or thousands of redundant tweets. In particular, the summaries page provides the following information, which is updated in real-time as new tweets are posted and as new information becomes available:
TweetDesk provides a unique way of visualizing and sum-marizing events using social media posts. It allows for an in-teractive investigation into events, and can provide in-depth information about an event which cannot easily be found using traditional social media interfaces. TweetDesk allows journalists and users to find out what is happening around the world, as it happens, and in a fully automated fashion. TweetDesk can be used to either compliment traditional so-cial media interfaces or as a standalone replacement for those who only use social media to follow events.
