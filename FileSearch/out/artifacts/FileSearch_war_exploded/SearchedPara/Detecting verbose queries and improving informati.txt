 1. Introduction
Most of the queries submitted to search engines are composed of a few keywords and have a length that ranges from these queries, which are called verbose queries, is the topic of this paper.

The main objectives of the paper are to:  X  assess the extent to which verbose queries affect the performance of a retrieval system; design and evaluate a methodology for processing verbose queries in order to improve system performance; provide a scheme for deciding which methods have to be applied for improving retrieval effectiveness depending on query length and verbosity.

The proposed methodology that combines an ad hoc incremental query expansion based on external resources with paper give some evidence that it could work in IR. 1 vides a blueprint for exploiting the information provided by the classifier to improve retrieval. and reduction algorithms in verbose query detection and processing. 2.

The methods that have been adopted are the following: stopword removal and stemming for the English language; query expansion based on a linguistic database; topic gisting based on a linguistic database; verbosity detection based on a decision tree; document retrieval based on the vector-space model.

About 84% nodes store one or two words. from those with verbose short queries, since a few topics have both long and short verbose queries.
The baseline used in the experiments is the retrieval model implemented in the Apache Lucene Library, version 3.1 the same result; however, we would like to keep this further investigation to the future research. verbosity and length is feasible and may improve retrieval effectiveness. 4.3. Result the results for the topics with verbose short queries. The rows of the tables are labeled by retrieval algorithm: baseline: only stopword and stemming; synonyms added: baseline followed by query expansion based on synonyms addition (Section 3 ); concepts added: baseline followed by topic gisting (Section 3 ); synonyms + concepts: baseline followed by  X  X  X ynonyms added X  X  and then by  X  X  X oncepts added X  X ; concepts + synonyms: baseline followed by  X  X  X oncepts added X  X  and then by  X  X  X ynonyms added X  X ; nouns + concepts:  X  X  X oncepts added X  X  using nouns only; nouns + verbs + concepts:  X  X  X oncepts added X  X  using nouns and verbs.
