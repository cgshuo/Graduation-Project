 In recent years, there has been an increasing effort on developing realistic models, and learning and inference algorithms to under-stand, predict, and influence diffusion over networks. This has been in part due to the increasing availability and granularity of large-scale diffusion data, which, in principle, allows for under-standing and modeling not only macroscopic diffusion but also mi-croscopic (node-level) diffusion. To this aim, a bottom-up approach has been typically considered, which starts by considering how par-ticular ideas, pieces of information, products, or, more generally, contagions spread locally from node to node apparently at random to later produce global, macroscopic patterns at a network level. However, this bottom-up approach also raises significant modeling, algorithmic and computational challenges which require leverag-ing methods from machine learning, probabilistic modeling, event history analysis and graph theory, as well as the nascent field of network science. In this tutorial, we will present several diffusion models designed for fine-grained large-scale diffusion data, present some canonical research problem in the context of diffusion, and introduce state-of-the-art algorithms to solve some of these prob-lems, in particular, network estimation, influence estimation and influence control.
This tutorial is meant for a broad audience at KDD, including students and researchers specifically interested in models and ma-chine learning methods in the context of diffusion over networks. It will provide an introduction to research problems, probabilistic models and machine learning methods in the context of diffusion of information, influence and behaviors over networks. No specific knowledge will be required beyond basic probability and graph the-ory; the tutorial is self-contained and most of the foundational con-cepts are introduced during the tutorial.

The participants will learn about the fundamental problems in diffusion networks, including network inference, influence estima-tion and influence control. We will present a concise overview of the main models and algorithms, the most recent theoretical results, the latter algorithms to support dynamic networks [14], topic mod-eling [8], and recurrent events [22, 23].
Given a diffusion model and an arbitrary set of nodes that ini-tially adopt a piece of information, idea or product, the influence estimation problem which is the basis for subsequent influence con-trol consists of estimating the average number of follow-ups these nodes can trigger. These estimation problems in various diffusion models are often NP-hard [2], and hence call for efficient approx-imation algorithms with provable guarantees. Furthermore, the problem can be complicated by additional constraints such as es-timating influence given a time windows. Here, we will formally define the problem, and briefly overview various algorithms for dif-ferent diffusion models [2, 3, 5, 6, 15]. We will then focus on two algorithms for continuous-time diffusion models with provable guarantees [6, 15], and show how they provide solutions to influ-ence estimation problem with additional timing constraints, and ex-ploit randomization to scale to networks with million of nodes.
Given a diffusion model, the influence control problem aims to manipulate either the information sources or the diffusion networks themselves in order to achieve certain outcome of the diffusion pro-cesses. For instance, in influence maximization, one aims to find a set of nodes whose initial adoptions of certain piece of informa-tion, idea or product can trigger the largest expected number of follow-ups. In influence blocking, one aims to remove a set of dif-fusion channels from a diffusion network such that rumor spread can be controlled, or, in influence facilitation, to add a set of dif-fusion channels such that an important announcement can reach people early. In influence shaping, one aims to drive the overall us-age of a service to a certain level per user by incentivizing a small number of users to take more initiatives. Here, we will formally de-fine the influence maximization, influence blocking and influence shaping problems and present several algorithms to solve them un-der different discrete-time diffusion models [2, 3, 18, 20, 21] and continuous-time diffusion models [6, 9, 15, 19].
