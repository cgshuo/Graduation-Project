 This paper is concerned with the problem of boosting social annotations using propagati on, which is also called social propagation . In particular, we focus on propagating social annotations of web pages (e.g., annotations in Del.icio.us). Although social annotations are de veloping fast, they cover only a small proportion of Web pages on the World Wide Web. To alleviate the low coverage probl em, a general propagation model based on Random Surfer is proposed. Specifically, four steps are included: basic propagation, multiple-annotation propagation, multiple-link-type propagation, a nd constraint-guided propagation. Experimental results show that the proposed model is very effective in increasing coverage of annotations as well as preserving property of social annotations.

While social annotations are useful , many applications of social annotations suffer from the annot ation sparseness problem. The web resources with social a nnotations are still limited on the World Wide Web. Take Del.icio.us as an example, more than 1 million web users collected over 10 million web pages with millions of social annotations 1 . However, compared with 1.173 billion web users 2 and about 30 billion 3 web pages on WWW, the ratio of both social annotator s and annotated web pages still remains less than 0.1%. The annot ation sparseness problem also appears in the most popular web pages on WWW. To name a few, based on our study (random sample of about 10,000 pages), more than 75% of the pages in ODP are not annotated by web users; http://blog.del.icio.us/ http://www.internetworl dstats.com/stats.htm http://www.boutell.com/newf aq/misc/sizeofweb.html about 80% of pages within the top 100 most popular English sites have no annotation at all. To alleviate the annotation sparse ness problem effectively, this paper proposes a method, called social propagation , to boost social annotations automatica lly using propagation. More specifically, we propose a general social propagation model based on Random Surfer. The propagation m odel consists of four surfing steps: 1) basic surfing used to model the propagation of a single annotation via the same type of links; 2) multiple-annotation surfing used to deal with different social annotations; 3) multiple-link-type surfing designed for propagation via different types of links; and 4) constraint-guided surfing , used to deal with different capabilities of different links for propagation. We evaluate the proposed model with various propagation settings on a dataset of 40,422 pages. Site map-tree links, hyperlinks and constraint are incrementally added based on basic surfing and multiple-annotation surfing. Experime ntal results show that the proposed propagation model is not only effective in increasing the coverage of annotations, but also preserving the original property of social annotations. Let X  X  first consider a simplifie d configuration of propagating single social annotation via the sa me type of links. Assume that there is only one annotation a assigned to a page p . The purpose of a web surfer is to collect more pages related to annotation a . Then it may have a Markovian random surfing process starting at p as follows: Step 1. Stay at the same page with probability (1- X  ); 
Step 2. Move to a new page by following a link from one page to another with probability  X  . In the above model, a is similar to the expansion factor of PageRank [1]. It indicates the portion of annotation used for propagation at each step. The above model is able to propa gate social annotations to un-annotated pages. However, anot her problem arises that some pages initially annotated may lose all their annotations after the propagation with naive model. To avoid the problem, we http://www.alexa.com/site/ds /top_sites?ts_mode=lang&amp;lang=en * Part of Shenghua, Bohai and Shengliang X  X  work was conducted at IBM China Research Lab. introduce a new step (Step 0) to the beginning of naive model, i.e. the random surfer has an opportunity to stop with probability  X  and to continue with probability (1- X  ). 
Step 0. Terminate surfing with probability  X  or continue with probability (1- X  ); In the following part, for simplicity, we focus on extending the naive model from different aspect s to fit the requirement of effective social annotation propagation. 1) Multiple Annotations : Now, let X  X  consider a more complicated case of social annotation propagation. Assume that there is a set of count of c i for each annotation a i . In total, there are c annotations. Correspondingly, the random surfer has to decide which annotation to propagate. Then, the naive model can be refined by adding the following step (Step 1P) before Step 1 in Figure 1. 
Step 1P. Random selection of one annotation for propagation; 2) Multiple Link Types : Similar to previous work on relevance propagation [2], the annotations can also be propagated via different types of links, e.g., hyperlinks and sitemap-tree links. Our model can be further extended to propagate social annotations through different kinds of links. Without loss of generality, we assume that there are l types of links L T ={ L link, the surfer has different probability P ( L i ) to follow according to the link X  X  type. Then, the naive random surfer X  X  walk can be adjusted by adding the following step (Step 2P) before Step 2. 
Step 2P. Select a type of links L i with probability P ( L 3) Constraint : Links are good indicators for propagation, but they are not the whole story. The connection strength of two linked pages varies a lot. For example, some links are given to pages describing other topics. To prevent/alleviate the topic drifting, we add a constraint factor P ( p  X   X  p ) to guide the surfer X  X  walk. In this paper, P ( p  X   X  p ) is estimated by the cosine similarity between the TFIDF vectors of pure page cont ents. Then, the naive model can be revised by replacing the Step 2 with following step (Step 2 X ). 
Step 2 X . Move to a new page by following a link from one page to another with a probability  X  ; the selection probability of specific link p  X   X  p is in direct proportion to P ( p  X   X  p ). To evaluate the social propagati on model, we build a dataset by randomly crawling 100 most popular English sites in Alexa as well as 10 famous sites which are familiar to academic. The dataset consists of 40,422 pages distributed in 87 domains. 48,481 sitemap-tree links and 786,440 hyperlinks are extracted. Then each page is queried in Del.icio.us history to check whether it is annotated. 14.21% of them are annotated with 2,812 distinct meaningful annotations. We build 6 experiment settings (S 1-S6) as shown in Table 1. S1 does not use any annotation. S2 us es manual (original) annotations. S3-S6 use propagated annotati ons that derived from manual annotations with different propagation settings. Original Annotation  X  Propagated Annotation Constraint  X  Table 2 shows the propagation results. As we can see, both sitemap-tree links (S3) and hyper links (S4) improve the coverage of social annotations (i.e. the ratio of annotated web pages) significantly, and hyperlink improves more. By combining the two types of links, S5 can further improve the coverage to 66.90%. The use of constraint does not affect the coverage a lot and get coverage of 66.53% (S6), which is about 4 times of the coverage of annotations before propagation. 
Annotated Note again that a good social propagation should not only simply increase the coverage of social a nnotations, but also preserve the original property of social annota tions as well as possible. Here, we will mainly evaluate the keyword property indicating that annotations are good summary of the corresponding web page. For quantitative evaluation, we randomly selected 100 web pages which have more than 10 distin ct manual annotations and omitted their manual annotations during the propagation. Figure 2 shows the average overlap of top N annotations between original manual annotations and automatically propa gated annotations. It is easy to see that the overlap of propaga ted and manual annotations is above 0.4 in most cases and S6 achieves the best performance at each level with the help of propagation constraint. Social annotations are novel resources as well as useful information in many applications. In this pa per, we address the problem of boosting social annotations of web pages automatically using propagation. A general propagati on model based on Random Surfer is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed model can not only increase the coverage of annotation but also reserve the annotation property. In the future, we will also study the propagation of social annotations for other di gital resources e. g., images, by exploring some pseudo link information. [1] L. Page, S. Brin, R. Motwani, and T.
