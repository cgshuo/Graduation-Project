 1. Introduction
Most system empirical studies yield large and complex data-bases, large because data is recorded using high frequency sampling (compared to the system dynamics) and/or during a long time period and complex because data is heterogeneous. This is particu-larly true in the areas of human component system studies (psychology, medicine, ergonomics or sociology) with the possible presence of different scale mathem atical models (nominal, ordinal and quantitative) ( Stevens, 1974 ), of objective and subjective origins and of time and not-time variables. Whatever the strategy employed in conducting studies (observational, experimental or correlational method) ( Sheskin, 2007 ), the disciplinary fields focusing on data exploitation (e.g., Statistics, Pa ttern Recognition, Signal Analysis,
Data Mining, Artificial Intellige nce) propose many methods. Even though these fields are not independent, here are some possible
Taxonomic Dimensions (TD) that are often cited:  X  TD1, descriptive vs. inferential methods ( Sheskin, 2007 ),  X  TD2, monovariate vs. multivariate methods ( Jobson, 1991 ),  X  TD3, time vs. not-time methods ( Fitzmaurice et al., 2004 ), complex task so that as soon as all the time data sets have been recorded (or maybe one time dataset only), the system analyst may be in a hurry to get results. Then for questions of speed or lack of knowledge or curiosity, the analyst might choose a fast and well known data analysis path. For instance, in the case of a study performed using an experimental design (e.g., a chemical process in an industrial study), the researcher may rapidly want to test the statistical hypotheses that the experiment was pri-marily designed to test. The same behavior may occur in the case of a study performed using an observational design (e.g., a system including users and designers in a web use analysis over several years).
 rather automatic procedures, we suggest that, for a very first analysis at least, the human being must be present and he/she must choose a method being adapted to the data, which is different to run a method supposing that the data fit such or such model. For instance, with many signals, running the arithmetic mean program for summarizing time data has a poor meaning if the signals present sudden changes or a monotone evolution. In the same way, with experimental design data, running the usual variance analysis computing program has a poor meaning if the data is very far from the Laplace X  X auss model or the variances related to the factor levels are very different. Our point of view is to start the data analysis using knowledge and graphics as following. 2. Data analysis methodology
Let us consider this problem through the analysis of a system, where:  X  the inputs are the factors, which may be linked to the system or its environment and may have a nominal, ordinal and quantitative scale (in an experimental design, there are spe-cific factors named independent variables) ( Sheskin, 2007 ).  X  the outputs are the (measurement) variables, here again possibly with different kinds of scales (in an experimental design, these variables are often named dependent variables) ( Sheskin, 2007 ).

This notion of input and output sets can be used to attain four main objectives for the multifactor X  X ultivariate (MFMV) data analysis:  X  to determine the effects of the input variables on the output variables (objective named O1).  X  to discover the relationships bet ween the output variables (O2).  X  to find classes of variables and/or of empirical situations (human beings, countries, plants, jobs, system behavior states, y  X  to merely find data summaries (about failures, diseases, incomes, costs, y ) (O4).

Let us first focus on the case where the time factor is present in the database. To reach these objectives with MFMV data, the statistical analysis process cannot generally give results with a single stage. For instance, instead of using hypothesis testing statistical tests (i.e., inference statistics), as usually with MFMV experimental data, we suggest starting this process using the pair space-time windowing (STW)/Analysis showing factors and variables behaviors (ASFVB) and then, ending with such tests.

Let V be the measurement variable set where V , the size of V , is large, e.g., V 4 10 when mechanical and electric variables are present in a mechatronical system study or when physiological and action variables are present in a human component system study. Let U be the factor set which often contains more than
U  X  4 elements, e.g., individual (human being, tool, machine tool, plant y ), time and manipulated variables in an experimental design. As stated above V , U may contain several scale models. To reach results with a heterogeneous MFMV database, up to 5 data processing stages may be necessary ( Loslever, 2001 ): 1) Data characterization. The V time variables are characterized using V 0 synthetic indicators. With heterogeneous MFMV data, the main idea is to carefully analyze the magnitude histogram of each time variable, either globally or for specific time windows, which allows doubtful data to be differentiated (mainly shown in modes or in the lateral sides of the histogram). This analysis is used to build the indicator set V 0 , which becomes the analysis variable set. 2) Data coding. The V 0 variables are coded to make the variables compatible either with one another (particularly when both quantitative and qualitative scales are involved) or with a specific method (particularly with quantitative variables). For instance, a rank data set becomes the input of the Principal
Component Analysis in the descriptive context ( Jobson, 1991 ) and the input of a nonparametric test in the inferential context ( Sheskin, 2007 ). 3) Data organization. For a preliminary analysis, the data is organized so that it can be investigated using multivariate techniques. In most cases, the data is arranged in one table whose rows correspond to the statistical units (e.g., indivi-duals, experimental situations, time windows) and whose columns correspond to the analysis variables. 4) Relation, effect, class or summaries obtaining (objectives O1 to
O4). For instance, the data may be analyzed to determine relationships either between the V 0 analysis variables and the
U factors effects or between the V 0 analysis variables; the relations and/or the effects can also be found using classifica-tion and discrimination techniques ( Han and Kamber, 2006 ;
Jobson, 1991 ; Pal and Pal, 2001 ; Fitzmaurice et al., 2004 ). 5) Results presentation. The results are presented in up to three kinds of models: graphic (histograms, time excursions, scatter-plots, spectrums) ( Tufte, 1983 ; Pao and Meng, 1998 ), verbal (the conclusion to a statistical hypothesis test) ( Sheskin, 2007 ) or mathematical (multivariate regression, time series models) ( Jobson, 1991 ).

Thus a data analysis path (DAP) is a succession of A stages ( A r 5) with a specific method m ( m  X  1, y M a ) for each stage a ( a  X  1, y , A ). Facing a heterogeneous MFMV data set, the data analysis can be performed taking several DAPs. Obviously, at each stage, several loops may be necessary. For instance, in the choice of DAP set, three main  X  X  X actics X  X  are possible:  X  Descriptive analysis only, DAPs are mainly based on graphic and data summaries,  X  Inferential analysis only, DAPs are based on hypothesis tests, or  X  Combination of the two, (1) descriptive, (2) inferential, with several loops maybe.

Of course, the stage four mainly conditions a DAP. For instance, to show relationships between variables and the time influence in the descriptive DAP, the basic prin ciple is often the singular value decomposition ( Jobson, 1991 ), which yields methods such as Principal Component An alysis (PCA) or Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). Then, for each method, several options are available, conditioning the choices of stages 1 to 3. For instance, PCA can be used with several coding techniques ( Jobson, 1991 )andMCAwith either crisp or fuzzy windowing ( Benzecri, 1992 ).Thechoiceofa method and the respective options for the stage 4 is quite difficult. For instance, MCA with space windowing shows nonlinear relation-ships, but the output is much more complex than PCA output. Let us now consider the pair STW/ASFVB with actual data as the main elements of the descriptive DAP. 3. Didactic example
The example concerns the Driver X  X ar X  X nvironment System (DCES). The aim of the study considered here was to analyze the effect of road geometry  X  roads with or without curves, with or without a constant lane width  X  on car driving behavior, while taking time and individual differences into account. There are thus V  X  4 factors, one corresponding to the individual, two corresponding to the road geometry and the last one correspond-ing to the time. The experiment was conducted using a driving simulator (designed by PSA Peugeot X  X itro  X  en). A two-lane road circuit, including several geometric configurations, was simulated (i.e., with or without curves, with or without a constant lane width). The roads were marked with dashed center lines and continuous lines on the edges, with roadwork sections added from time to time in order to decrease the road width to a single lane. The circuit included a series of 12 geometric configurations that were covered 4 times consecutively, yielding 4 n 12  X  48 stretches of road (or sections) for a total of 44 km (see Table 2 ).
I  X  10 participants were instructed to drive as they usually do. The duration of the driving task was about 20 min.

Sample measurements (30 Hz) were taken of car speed X 0 (m/s), car lateral position Y (m), and heading error HE ( 1 )( Wierwille and
Muto, 1981 ). To introduce the notion of safety, three additional variables were computed: left lateral distance prior to collision D (m), longitudinal distance prior to collision D X (m) ( Sidaway et al., 1996 ) and visibility distance D V (m) ( Fig. 1 ). The experiment thus produced I  X  10 individual data sets, each one containing a multi-dimensional signal (MS) with V  X  6 variables (with about 36 samples) and U  X  4 factors. For a very first analysis, the DAP is as following. 3.1. Data characterization
A separate magnitude histogram was created for the entire set of values obtained for each of the six variables (for a given variable, the I individual histograms had more or less the same pattern). Three main histogram patterns emerged: (1) more or less symmetric ( Y , X 0 , HE ), (2) dissymmetric with one mode ( D and D V ) and (3) dissymmetric with two modes ( D YL ).
Keeping in mind objectives O1 and O2, the principle of factor analysis was used. Due to the presence of non-gaussian histogram patterns and the possibility to have non-linear relationships between the variables, MCA was preferred to the classic PCA. See ( Benzecri, 1992 ) for a tutorial about MCA and ( Loslever and
Lepoutre, 2004 ) for a comparison between MCA  X  with either crisp and fuzzy windowing  X  and PCA. This multidimensional method requires a space windowing with quantitative variables, let us first consider the cutting of the V  X  6 scales. Since one distribution displayed two modes  X  MO1 and MO2  X  at least S  X  5 space win-dows (also called space modalities) were considered: one around each mode, one between the two modes and one for each extreme.
The number of space windows was the same for the V  X  6 variables to avoid favoring a particular variable in the multivariate statistical analysis. The windows were labeled very low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H) and very high (VH). With histogram patterns 1or2,almostthesamefrequencieswereusedforwindowsinallfive categories in order to maximize the entropy, and fuzzy membership functions were designed in order to reduce the information loss due to changing from a continuous scale to a category scale. With histogram pattern 3, the members hip functions were built interac-tively so that each modal area could be included within a window.
To remain in a statistical context, the membership values have to add up to 1 across the levels of the S  X  5 windows for each time sample.
Fig. 2 shows the V  X  6 magnitude histograms and the corresponding space windowing. The histogram p atterns are consistent with the actual meaning of the data: 3.2. Data coding membership values). In the same way, the factors may be considered through membership values. So the data coding stage is not required. 3.3. Data organization driving during a time window, each time window t ( t  X  1,
T  X  12 n 4  X  48) yields S  X  5 membership value averages (MVA). Once all the time data was characterized, these MVA were organized in a table T1 ,with R  X  480 rows ( I  X  10 individuals with T  X  48 time windows) and C  X  30 columns ( V  X  6 variables with S  X  5 space windows). The generic value of T1 is m it,vs , that is the MVA for a pair (individual x time window; variable x space window) ( Table 1 ). 3.4. Relation analysis between their space windows) and the influences of all the factors (i.e., time, individual and experimental) on these variables, T1 was investigated using MCA. With this method, let us remind that a space window trajectory is built for each initial quantitative variable v , linking the corresponding S  X  5 space modalities together. Analyzing these V  X  6 trajectories will highlight any linked variable groups and the relationship between them.
Then a time window trajectory may be built for each indivi-dual i , linking the corresponding T  X  48 time modalities together in increasing order. Analyzing the row points will highlight the existence of outliers and similarities between empirical situations, i.e., all the pairs ( i,t ). Let us remind that with MCA two rows r and r 0 and two columns c and c 0 are compared using the chi-square distance, i.e., d  X  r , r 0  X  X  d 2  X  X  i , t  X  ,  X  i 0 , t 0  X  X  d  X  c , c 0  X  X  d 2  X  X  v , s  X  ,  X  v 0 , s 0  X  X  where a point ( ) means a sum over the subscript it replaces. The number of MCA results being rather high and since these results require some experience to be understood (from the statistical point of view), only one of them will be considered here. Fig. 3 shows inter and intra-individual differences for 2 drivers. To show the factor effects, an interesting possibility of MCA (and any method based on principal axes building) consists into projecting points that have no action on the positioning of these axes onto these axes (or planes obtained by combining two axes) ( Benzecri, 1992 ). For instance, to show the influence of the individual factor (with I  X  10 levels), the procedure is the following: (1) for each individual i ( i  X  1, y , I ), the MVA from all the corresponding initial MVA is computed and (2) the 10 new points are projected onto the planes crossing the two main axes.

To appreciate more quantitatively these differences, the MVA quintuplets are indicated. Even though MCA gives good ideas concerning the pairs ( i,t ) (i.e., about intra and inter-individual driving differences), MCA descriptive character makes it difficult to tell whether differences between the pair sets are significant or not. Thus, another analysis is necessary to study these differences more precisely and to present the results more conveniently. 3.5. Result presentation
For instance, let us consider the statistical test context. Since the first factor plane for the 10 drivers mainly puts forward three road section subsets ( Fig. 3 ), only a representative element of each subset was used for the inferential analysis. For the subset of 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0 30
DX : Longitudinal distance before collision (m) 0 2000 4000 10000 0 80 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 0 70 Frequency (%) straight sections with roadworks or narrow stretches, Section 9 was chosen because it is the longest one (500 m vs. 16 m and 128 m for Sections 7 and 8, respectively, see Table 2 ). For the other two subsets, sections with the same length and similar curvature radii were selected: Section 2 (1000 m length and
R  X  2000, left turn) and Section 4 (1000 m length and R  X  800, right turn). Thus, P  X  3 pair comparisons can be made (Section 9 vs. Section 4, Section 9 vs. Section 2 and Section 4 vs. Section 2). with distributions that may be far from the Laplace X  X auss one, see
Fig. 2 , a nonparametric test (Fisherian case) with non-independent samples were chosen. Instead of presenting the results only verbally or only in the form of a table as usually, we chose to retain the graphic aspect of MCA. Thus Fig. 4 wasbuiltforcomparisonto Fig. 3 . the descriptive and inferential DAP results are consistent. Obvious differences highlighted by MCA  X  when the space window trajec-tory does not have a complex pattern  X  are confirmed by the test procedure (see variable Y , for instance). The less obvious differ-ences highlighted by MCA  X  when the space window trajectory has a complex pattern  X  may be either confirmed or not, but in either case, there is no contradiction between the conclusions of the 12 tests realized and the outputs of the MCA (see Fig. 4 ). 4. Discussion and conclusion 4.1. Generally speaking
The main idea of our five-stages procedure is to start the analysis using as much as possible the actual behavior of the data and the domain expert X  X  knowledge. If several more sophisticated methods do exist to investigate a time database ( Tak-ching, 2011 ;
Pandit and Wu, 2001 ), displaying magnitude histograms and cutting the scales (for variables and/or the factors) can be performed first. The fuzzy space windowing (FSW) must be based on the domain knowledge, which is linked with the specificity of the histogram (such as modal areas) and the real meaning of the scale (e.g., distinguishing between acceleration and deceleration).
Then, the membership value table can be considered as MCA input. Here again more sophisticated methods (with or without automatic procedures) can be used. This is the case of classifica-tion/clustering methods ( Jobson, 1991 ; Moschopoulos et al., 2009 ), but most procedures are able to deal either with the variables or the empirical situations. On the contrary, MCA allows to show both points corresponding to the variables (through their space windows) and to the empirical situations. One must acknowledge that considering a space trajectory with S points for a variable v with MCA is much more complex that considering a single point for a variable v , such as with the usual Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ( Jobson, 1991 ; Kuri-Morames and Rodriguez-Erazo, 2009 ), nevertheless it becomes possible to line out more complex relational phenomena. For instance, imagine a parabolic relation between 2 variables v and v 0 ; thanks to 2 space window point consideration and the way the MCA main axes are positioned (i.e., with the relative contribution of space window points which are given by the table that aid interpreta-tion, just as with PCA), one may obtain  X  X  X hen v is M , v 0 is VL and when v is either VL or VH, v 0 is VH X  X  (it is worth noting that with a linear relation between 2 variables v and v 0 , the 2 spaces trajectory may look like a parabola, the first main axis opposing VL and VH windows, the second main axis opposing M windows to extreme ones (VL and VH). Of course the idea of space windowing with quantitative variables makes it possible to draw relationships between quantitative and qualitative variables.
Another advantage of the FSW/MCA pair is the possibility to shown outliers. This approach is less automatic than others ( Han and Kamber, 2006 ; Garces and Sbarbaro, 2011 ) but, thanks to the interpretation of the main axes, it becomes possible to known for which space window and/or which space window combination( s ) the outliers occur.

Finally, the possibility to consider points without any contribu-tion to the main axes positioning (e.g., supplementary points) ( Benzecri, 1992 ), makes it possible to show the factor influences.
Using a Data Analysis Path (DAP) based on fuzzy space window-ing and MCA has several advantages compared to a more traditional
DAP. However, these advantages have a price. The method is rather complex and most of the time requires many feedbacks, especially when dealing with numerous factors or variables. Understanding relationships among those requires to consider iteratively subsets of the original database or to use the supplementary points projection capacity of the method, and this takes time and space to get the results. Nevertheless, with a good knowledge and practice of the method, its assets largely compensate its drawbacks. 4.2. Concerning the driver X  X ar X  X nvironment system (DCES)
With time multivariate data, the literature often considers high summarizing technique and/or monovariate analyses. Here we have suggested to keep both the time fact or and the multivariate aspect.
A number of results stand out from the descriptive analysis. One of them is the high correlation between the two variables that were specifically designed to characterize the notion of safety (i.e., D longitudinal distance prior to collision and D V , the visibility dis-tance). Such a result is consiste nt with the way the two variables were built. Nevertheless, a careful analysis of the space window trajectories in the three factor planes (1,2), (3,4) and (5,6) (not shown) indicates that the relationship is not fully linear. The D variation observed along horizontal lines can be explained by modifications in the heading error of the vehicle.
 descriptive analysis is the possibility of consistently defining behavior classes a posteriori in terms of the apriori driving situation. This indicates that the analysis variables allow the different road environments (e.g., geometry, obstacles) to be differentiated in terms of driver behavior (with multivariate aspect). Inter-individual differences were highlighted for sharp left-hand curves ( Sections 2 and (5)), principally related to the lateral vehicle position ( Y ). For example, subject 1 drove more often in the middle of the right lane, while the other drivers positioned their cars to the left. Despite these differences, it appears, as we had thought, that the driving behavior is time consistent. A single subject behaves identically in all four laps (4 n 11  X  44 km).
More particularly, there were large differences in the variables Y and right lateral distance prior to collision D YR for narrow straight sections and curves. Of course, as suggested in the first part of this discussion, more sophisticated techniques could be used in a second analysis ( Wang et al., 2010 ).
 using rather automatic procedures, we have shown that employing first graphical techniques allows adapting the models to the data instead of the contrary. Using this technique leads to a DAP that can be generalized ( Fig. 5 ). This DAP is based on fuzzy space windowing, then membership value summarizing using the arith-metic mean within each fuzzy time window and then MCA. In these steps, outliers, connections between the variables and factor effects on the most informative variables can be pointed out.
Furthermore, thanks to membership value averaging, this can be done for qualitative/quantitative data and temporal/non temporal data, in the same analysis. In addition the possibility to add
Factors (independant variables) supplementary points make possible to show the impact of specific factors, such as the  X  X  X ndividual X  X  in human machine studies.
In a second phase of the DAP, other techniques can be used for example to test statistically the significance of the results, or if needed, more sophisticated techniques.
