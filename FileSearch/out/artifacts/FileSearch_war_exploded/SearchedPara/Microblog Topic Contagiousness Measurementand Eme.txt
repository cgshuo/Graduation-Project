 A recent study on collective attention in Twitter shows that an epidemic spreading of hashtags is predominantly driven by external factors. We extend a time-series form of susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model to monitor microblog emerging outbreaks by considering both endoge-nous and exogenous drivers. In addition, we adopt partially labeled Dirichlet allocation (PLDA) model to generate both background latent topics and hashtag topics. It overcomes the problem of small available samples in hashtag analysis by including related but unlabeled tweets through inference. We standardize hashtag topic contagiousness measure as the estimated effective-reproduction-number (  X  R ) derived from epidemiology. It is obtained by Bayesian parameter estima-tion. Guided by  X  R , one can profile and categorize emerging topics, and generate alerts on potential outbreaks. Experi-ment results confirm the effectiveness of this approach.

Study of the causes and effects of diseases and their prop-agation patterns have always been the subjects in epidemi-ology. However, epidemiology can be literally interpreted as  X  X he study of what is upon the people X  based on the mean-ing of its root words 1 . Social networks are booming at an http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology unprecedented scale, providing various platforms for people to connect with each other, e.g., microblogging is one of the methods of short message communications. In this paper, we investigate into microblog epidemiology and to formulate an monitoring framework to identify emerging outbreaks, such as breaking news events, cultural phenomena, etc., by using Bayesian parameter estimation methods [9, 38].

Kermack and McKendrick X  X  deterministic models on epi-demics [28, 29, 30] are commonly discussed in literature, such as [22] and [25], to form an introduction to mathemat-ical epidemiology. A simple form of their models is called susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model [11]. In this model, a population is divided into three mutually exclusive compartments: susceptible, infectious, and recovered, as-suming that the population is large and closely connected. SIR explains the propagation of a disease within a popula-tion by a set of differential equations governing the relation-ships between compartments. Kermack and McKendrick propose an epidemic parameter R 0 to quantify the conta-giousness of infectious diseases, which is commonly known as basic-reproduction-number [28, 29, 30].

In the domain of collective attention on the Twitter social network (Twitter), Lehmann et al. [31] show that epidemic spreading of hashtags in Twitter only plays a minor role in their popularity; but is mostly driven by exogenous factors. Their focus is on Twitter messages (i.e., tweets) with spe-cific hashtags. It is a common approach used in hashtag analysis but is known to suffer from small available sample problem. For example, the number of tweets with hash-tags in a corpus can be as low as 3.3% (as used by [31]). Four groups of temporal patterns are identified from their dataset: 1) activities concentrated before and during a peak of epidemic spreading of hashtags, 2) activities concentrated during and after a peak, 3) activities concentrated symmet-rically around a peak, and 4) activities almost totally con-centrated on a single day. However, only the third group is close to an epidemic spreading pattern as shown in Figure 2(a). This, prima facie , indicates that a SIR model may not be best to describe the propagation of collective attention.
In this paper, we approach the problem from a differ-ent perspective by considering whether topics in discussion exhibit any emerging-epidemic-like propagation patterns, where the topics are identified from tweets with hashtags. By identifying topics in Twitter, we can also include tweets without hashtags by inference to address the small avail-able sample problem. In addition, we also look into the intrinsic epidemic potential of emerging topics under the influence of both endogenous and exogenous drivers. For Figure 1: New case propagation pattern of hashtag #ZodiacFacts from Twitter large corpus (described in Section 5) example, influence between peers such as follower/followee relationships and retweets are of endogenous nature, whilst publicity campaigns out of Twitter or mass media communi-cation are exogenous. The epidemic potential is revealed by studying estimated effective-reproduction-number (  X  R ), that resembles the study of the evolution of emerging infectious diseases by zoonotic virus [3]. The topic data are expected to be stochastic, sometimes sparse, and their temporal pat-terns are emerging-infectious-diseases like. For illustration, the new case propagation pattern of a hashtag, a standard epidemic, and an emerging infectious disease are shown in Figures 1, 2(a) and 2(b) respectively.

To summarise, our contributions are as follows: The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-tion 2 discusses related work. Section 3 presents our pro-posed emerging outbreak mining model for topics, including discussions of topic discovery and SIR model. Section 4 dis-cusses an outbreak monitoring framework based on Bayesian parameter estimation. Section 5 presents our experiment re-sults; and finally, Section 6 summarizes this paper.
Although there are some investigations into the mechanics of information diffusion [17, 42, 44], the discovery of break-ing events [10] and the discovery of emerging trends [18] in microblogs, there is a lack of standardized contagious-ness measures for comparison and monitoring. However, epidemiology has been a significant contributor to policy de-cision making [12], evidence-based medicine [41], risk factors identification [2], and early intervention of susceptible pop-ulations [6]. In particular, mathematical epidemiology uses mathematical models to investigate the dynamics of infec-tious diseases by using standardized measures [22]. One of the early examples of mathematical epidemiology was done by Daniel Bernoulli in 1760 to evaluate the effectiveness of variolation of healthy people with smallpox virus through a puncture on their skin [22]. Lately, infectious diseases mod-eling has been playing a prominent role in emerging infec-tious diseases prevention and control, e.g., Severe acute res-piratory syndrome (SARS) [33] and influenza H1N1 (swine flu) [14], and to study the development and spread of drug resistant bacteria, e.g., Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [37].

SIR [11, 28, 29, 30] is one of the models in mathemati-cal epidemiology. It divides a closed population into three mutually exclusive compartments, whereas the dynamics of this closed system is governed by a set of differential equa-tions. R 0 must exceed unity in order for the occurrence of an epidemic outbreak [28, 29, 30]. SIR model has been shown to fit well with epidemic data, e.g., the main wave of the 1918-1919 pandemic in England and Wales [25, 36], and the recent A(H3) influenza seasonal time-series as shown in Figure 2(a). In particular, it best fits the cases where the modeling time frame is short and the size of the population is large and dense. R 0 is used as a key metric for the compar-ison of the propagation of diseases in a community [22]. It is important to note that R 0 is not only disease specific, it also depends on the behavior within a social group being mea-sured. R 0 can be quite different between two social groups with different behaviors while having the same disease [27].
Over the last decade, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [5] class of topic mining solutions have proven themselves as the state-of-the-art topic mining methods. However, Zhao et al. [48] suggest that it may have difficulty in handling short messages, likes tweets which are only 140 characters in length maximally. There are several proposals in recent literature trying to alleviate the difficulty from different di-rections, such as 1) partially supervised learning model, e.g., Labeled LDA [39] and partially labeled Dirichlet allocation (PLDA) [40]; 2) single topic model, e.g., Twitter-LDA [48]; and 3) pooling schemes such as [24, 34]. Another problem of LDA is that sometimes the meaning of identified topics may be hard to interpret and difficult to associate with real-world objects [39]. LDA also faces a computational chal-lenge where the calculation of posterior distribution of hid-den variables is intractable [5]. Despite the availability of robust approximation algorithms, e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational inference, a more scalable solution is always desirable. A recent proposal by Hoffman et al. [23] on an online approach to variational inference for LDA is one of the examples to address computational difficulties.
On the other hand, Mehrotra et al. [34] propose a hash-tag labeling algorithm to address sample size problem in hashtag analysis. The algorithm first pools all tweets by existing hashtags; then, if the cosine similarity score (calcu-lated by using term frequency and term frequency-inverse document frequency vector space representations) between an unlabeled and a labeled tweet exceeds a certain confi-dence threshold, assign the hashtag of the labeled tweet to the unlabeled tweet. However, this approach is unlikely able to handle tweets with multiple discussion topics.
Traditional hashtag analysis suffers from low usable sam-ple size. It is also impacted by a relative short length of Twitter messages, making the analysis very difficult. We ap-proach these problems as follows. First, instead of focusing on hashtags directly, we identify topics by using partially supervised topic learning method with hashtags as labels. (a) A Seasonal infectious disease  X  A(H3) influenza virus isolated by WHO/NREVSS Collaborating Laboratories 2012-2013 season week 35 report (ending August 31, 2013) [7] Second, based on the signatures of topics, related tweets are retrieved by inference. Third, we enhance a SIR time-series model for emerging outbreak modeling. In Section 4, we in-corporate the three components into an outbreak monitoring framework by using Bayesian parameter estimation.
We employ Z to denote a set of topics z . For example, news events such as  X  X he Haiti earthquake X , entities such as  X  X ichael Jackson X  and subjects such as  X  X lobal warming X , etc, are topic candidates. In the context of microblogging, #haiti, #michaeljackson and #globalwarming are popular hashtags representing the three candidates in social media, respectively. Commonly used topic models, such as LDA [5], rely on observed documents to infer their hidden topic structure. The generative process behind LDA assuming the words in each document are generated by a two-stage process: 1) randomly choose a distribution over topics, and 2) for each word in a document, randomly choose a topic from the distribution in step 1 and then randomly choose a word from a distribution over a vocabulary. As a result, we obtain a collection of documents sharing the same set of topics, but each document discusses those topics in different proportion [4]. However, our focus is on known topics, while still allowing for unknown background discussions. Partially labeled Dirichlet allocation (PLDA) is used as it considers preferred topics while still discovering hidden corpus-wide latent topics with minimal supervision [40]. The topic model can then be applied to the without hashtag portion of tweets to identify other messages embedded with similar topics.
PLDA assumes that there is a set of labels L (indexed by l  X  X  1 ...L } ), and each of the labels is assigned with a num-ber of topics K (indexed by k  X  X  1 ...K L } ). Each topic is a multinomial distribution  X  l,k over all terms in a vocabulary V drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet prior  X  . A special label j is defined, which represents a global latent topic class. It can exist in every message m  X  M . PLDA assumes that each topic takes part in exactly one label; however, each label can have multiple topics. The generative process is summarized in Algorithm 1. We take the assumption that each hashtag only associates with one topic because a label to a short message should be very focused. However, the number of background latent topics remains as an unknown parameter. We propose to estimate an appropriate value Algorithm 1 Generative process in PLDA 1: for each message m  X  X  do 2: Draw a label class  X  i from a sparse binary vector prior 5: end for 6: Draw a message-specific mix of observed labels  X  7: for each word position in m do 8: Draw a label l from  X  m 11: end for 12: end for based on the level of divergence within a topic set, which is obtained by PLDA on a subset of tweets being examined.
A topic is defined as a probability distribution over a vo-cabulary. We handle topic set matching by using aggre-gated Jensen-Shannon divergence (aggJSD) with Hungarian method [8], and measure the topic differences within a topic set by using auto-Jensen-Shannon divergence (autoJSD) [8]. Both are based on Jensen-Shannon divergence ( D JS ) [15]. In a Jensen-Shannon divergence matrix ( D JS ) of a topic set pair p and q , the ( x,y ) element of D JS is equal to D
JS ( t px k t qy ) where t px is the topic x distribution of topic set p and t qy is the topic y distribution of topic set q . We achieve the goal of automated topic matching by finding an assignment which gives the smallest aggJSD. When both p and q are referred to the same topic set, we sum up the D
JS values in D JS matrix and then divide the total by the number of non-diagonal elements (as it has a zero diagonal) to obtain auto-Jensen-Shannon divergence (autoJSD) of a topic set. A higher value of autoJSD indicates a higher di-vergence (or less redundancy) among the topic distributions within a topic set. In our experiments, autoJSD is used to estimate the number of background latent topics.

On top of the findings in [40] that PLDA outperforms both Labeled LDA and LDA on documents, our experiments also confirm that PLDA with hashtags as labels consistently outperforms LDA on Twitter large corpus. The connections between the topics in LDA and PLDA topic sets are es-tablished by aggJSD with Hungarian method, where the matched topics with less than 20% of divergence are selected for comparison. Moreover, a recent study on using LDA to classify tweets from a variety of datasets have shown promis-ing results [35]. They provide evidence that our approach to discovering Twitter topics is robust and with expected higher precision and recall (lower-bounded by the findings in [35]). Next step is to formulate an emerging outbreak model that is built based on SIR model, which we will first briefly discuss. SIR model [11, 28, 29, 30] divides a closed population set N into three mutually exclusive compartments according to their status: a) Susceptible set S , b) Infectious set I , and time-step t  X  X  1 ...T } . |S ( t ) | + |I ( t ) | + |R ( t ) the size of the population. Here are the assumptions made in the diffusion of a disease z over N : 1) no demographics (births, deaths or migration) in N such that |N ( t ) for all t ; 2) all individuals in N are born at t = 0; 3) all s  X  S have no immunity to z , they move into I once being infected; 4) every n  X  X  is in contact with all n 0  X  X N \ n } ; 5) every i  X  I spreads z to s  X  S with a constant rate  X  (transmission rate) and remains in I over an infectious period before moving into R with a constant rate  X  (recovery rate); and 6) all r  X  X  are immune from z for life.
Let S ( t ) = |S ( t ) | , I ( t ) = |I ( t ) | and R ( t ) = |R { 1 ...T } . Based on SIR model, the propagation of z over N is described by the following differential equations: dS dt Kermack and MacKendrick [28, 29, 30] obtain an epidemic threshold result that the basic-reproduction-number R (  X / X  ) S (0) /N must exceed unity when S (0) /N  X  1 in order for an epidemic outbreak to occur. R 0 has long been used as a key metric for the comparison of the propagation of diseases in a community, which is commonly defined as the average number of secondary infections that occur when one infection is introduced into a susceptible population [22].
SIR model has been shown to fit well with epidemic data [25, 36]. According to the assumptions made in SIR, it best fits the cases with short modeling time as well as large and dense population. The mathematical method to model the characteristics of spreading of diseases can be enhanced to model an outbreak in digital social media, like Twitter, due to the following reasons: 1) the population size of social me-dia is large and it should be relatively static within the time frame of a social outbreak, 2) nearly everyone should be sus-ceptible (no immunity) as most of the social outbreak top-ics are new, 3) homogeneous transmission rate and recovery rates are reasonable assumptions for a large population, 4) only new topics can catch people X  X  attention in today X  X  fast-pacing digital society, etc. Analytical solutions for SIR have been derived in recent time [20]; and therefore, it would be a convenient model to use. However, a standard SIR model cannot fully describe emerging outbreaks. In particular, a time-series form of SIR model is required for ongoing moni-toring. In addition, both endogenous and exogenous drivers should be considered together. As a result, an emerging outbreak model is derived in next section.
A simple SIR model only considers endogenous propa-gation; and therefore, would not be able to model emerg-ing outbreak completely. For emerging outbreaks, multiple introductions from exogenous sources may contribute to a number of observed cases. Similar concerns have also been considered in epidemic outbreak modeling [3]. We enhance their case progression model and exclude death events based on the assumption of no demographics to establish the rela-tionship of change in cases between discretized consecutive time-steps for endogenous propagation.

Let  X ( t ) be the total number of cases of a topic up to time t , such that d  X ( t ) /dt =  X S/NI . The number of new cases over a short period of time  X  is equal to  X ( t +  X  )  X   X ( t ) =  X  X ( t +  X  ). Moreover, by integrating Equation (1) between t and t +  X  , we obtain where b ( R t ) = exp [  X  X  ( R t  X  1)], by assuming that S ( t ) /N remains constant over the time period of [ t,t +  X  ] where R 0 =  X / X  and R t = ( S ( t ) /N )  X  R 0 . The approximation is valid provided that I ( t ) /N is small (  X  X I ( t ) /NR [3]. By assuming that S ( t ) /N is piecewise constant over [ t,t +  X  ] but varies between intervals, we discretize the dif-ferential equation for the change in total number of cases between t and t +  X  as by using Equation (4). Similarly, the change in total number of cases between t  X   X  to t is equal to As a result, we obtain by substituting Equation (7) into Equation (6).

According to Equation (8), a close to linear relationship is expected between  X  X ( t +  X  ) and  X  X ( t ) with a slope of b ( R t ). Evidence of this near linear relationship can be ob-tained diagrammatically by plotting a  X  time-step shifted time-series against the original, namely a lag- X  plot. A lag-1 plot (  X  = 1) of the new case time-series of hashtag topic ZodiacFacts is generated as shown in Figure 3. Lag-1 plots (  X  = 1) of the time-series of A(H3) (Figure 4(a)) and H5N1 (4(b)) are produced and they confirm our expectation  X  A(H3) exhibits a close to linear relationship as R t changes smoothly over the time-series; however, H5N1 does not. It may be because the model does not cater for exogenous ef-fects. We can observe that lag-1 plot of the time-series of hashtag topic ZodiacFacts exhibits a pattern closer to what appears to be emerging disease H5N1.
 We next cater for the exogenous impacts by extending Equation (1) with an additional term dB ( t ) /dt , representing the external influence to the same topic caused by exogenous Figure 3: Lag-1 plot (  X  X ( t + 1) vs  X  X ( t ) ) of hashtag topic ZodiacFacts time-series, where the lines be-tween data points represent consecutive time con-nections factors during a time period of dt : Please note that dB ( t ) /dt is the net external effect which could be driven by a complex process from multiple exoge-nous forces. We take the assumption that dB ( t ) /dt is con-stant in this investigation.

By integrating Equation (9) between t and t +  X  (similar to how we obtain Equations (2), (3), and (4)), we obtain where  X ( t, X ,B ) represents the integral term in Equation (11). We come up with  X  X ( t +  X  ) =  X  B ( t +  X  )+ for the case covering both endogenous and exogenous fac-tors similar to how we obtain Equation (8) for the case where only endogenous influence is considered. Finally, let  X  X  0 ( t ) =  X  X ( t )  X   X  B ( t ), we can rewrite Equation (13) to It is worthwhile to highlight the resemblance between Equa-tions (8) and (14); however, a near linear lag-1 relationship does not hold in the latter due to the integral term even with the  X  B ( t ) term deducted from  X  X ( t ).
In this section, we incorporate topic discovery and SIR time-series emerging outbreak model into a monitoring framework. Presume that  X  X  0 ( t +  X  ) is a discrete random variable generated from a probability distribution where only the average number of new cases  X  is known, and is given by Equation (14). According to the principle of max-imum entropy, if the available information about a distri-bution is only the class it belongs to but nothing else, the Figure 4: Lag-1 plot (  X  X ( t + 1) vs  X  X ( t ) ), where the lines between data points represent consecutive time connections distribution with the highest entropy should be chosen. It is because maximizing entropy not only minimizes the amount of prior information built into the distribution [26], many physical systems tend to move towards maximal entropy configurations over time [13].

For a distribution with only an available mean, e.g., aver-age number of new cases  X  in our case, the maximum entropy distribution is Poisson [21]; hence, we assign  X  X ( t +  X  )  X  Pois (  X  ). Assuming that the exogenous effect is constant be-tween t and t +  X  , we calculate the integral to first order as  X ( t, X ,B ) =  X dB/dt and approximate it by its discrete ap-proximation  X  B ( t ) (the number of exogenous influence per unit time). As a result, Equation (14) is rewritten to: We follow the dynamic model form of Bayesian melding ap-proach [9, 38] for parameter estimation by applying Bayes X  theorem to model each time-step: p ( R, X  |  X  t +1  X   X  t ) = p (  X  t +1 The effective-reproduction-number R and recovery rate  X  are estimated by successively applying Equation (16) with the posterior distribution for R and  X  at time-step t as the prior at time-step t + 1, where Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used to explore the parameter space with Gelman-Rubins as convergence diagnostic. R is expected to change over time because of the progressive reduction of S ( t ) /N and the availability of more information from new observations.
To commence the estimation, we adopt an unbiased uni-form distribution function for R and  X  with their minimum and maximum values between 0 and 6, and 0 and 1, respec-prior. The selection of the range for R is based on the find-ings from our na  X   X ve approach to R 0 estimation in Section 5.1. The outstanding parameter for the successive Bayes X  rule application now remains with the selection of an ap-propriate  X  B so that we can derive  X  X  0 ( t ) from  X  X ( t ). Deviance information criterion (DIC) [46] is used to guide our selection of  X  B , in which a smaller value indicates a model is better supported by data. Although it is possible to estimate the average frequency of exogenous inference per unit time by mining the periodic patterns from a dataset, such as segment-wise periodic patterns mining [19], we elect a simple approach assuming a constant rate of influence to focus on the subject in our initial investigation and leave it as a future extension. In our experiments in Section 5.3, we choose  X  = 1 day and calculate the number of new cases at time t by counting the number of users who first use a hashtag topic to form a time-series. To cater for partial in-volvements, a user can continue to participate in a hastag topic partial discussion until the user total involvement is larger or equal to one. The user is then counted as first use of the hashtag topic. It is important to note that on average a 70.12% reduction in DIC value (the smaller the better) is achieved in our experiments by considering both endogenous and exogenous factors versus a model that only considers endogenous factors.

To conduct the emerging topic mining process, we first separate hashtags from messages in a dataset. The number of latent topics selection is guided by autoJSD, and then PLDA modeling on the portion of the messages with hash-tags is executed to obtain topic signatures. The PLDA model is then applied to the rest of the dataset to ob-tain a message-topic-distribution matrix, where each mes-sage without hashtag is assigned with its involvements in the identified topics from the PLDA model. We extract all the messages related to each topic z  X  Z (1: t ) . After calcu-lating the number of new cases at time t by counting the number of users first involved in a topic z , we obtain a time-series  X  X ( t ), and a time-series  X  X  0 ( t ) of topic z by selecting a suitable  X  B ( t ). Bayesian parameter estimation is applied to obtain  X  R for each topic; whereas alerts can be issued for cases where  X  R  X  1. The mining and alert process at each time-step t is detailed in Algorithm 2. The whole process can be done in an incremental manner and the PLDA mod-eling function, i.e., PLDA-Model(  X  ), in step 2 of Algorithm 2 is assumed to be an incremental implementation of PLDA.
As an example,  X  R time-series of hashtag topics haiti , hopeforhaiti , and hopeforhaitinow in January 2010 are shown in Figure 5. Guided by DIC, the external influence to the three hashtag topics are found to be 40%, 30% and 0% respectively in Section 5.3. While general elections had been planned for January 2010 in Haiti, they were postponed due to a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on 12 January 2010 2 . The contagious peaks (alerts) observed from Figure 5(b) are most likely due to the pre-election discussions and the earthquake. The epidemic discussion of hashtag topic hopeforhaitinow is found to be longer than if one just considering messages with hashtags alone, as shown in Figure 5(a). It is mainly driven http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti\#21st_century Algorithm 2 Emerging topic mining 2: Estimate the number of background latent topics by autoJSD 7: Calculate  X  R and  X   X  of z by using Bayesian parameter esti-8: Generate alerts on topic z if  X  R  X  1 9: end for (a) Tweets with hashtags only and without taking ex-ternal influence into consideration (b) Tweets with Hashtags plus tweets without hashtag by inference (external influences to hashtag topics haiti , hopeforhaiti and hopeforhaitinow are estimated to be 40%, 30% and 0% respectively) Figure 5: Estimated R of selected hashtag topics of a major event by endogenous momentum (0% of external influence) versus hopeforhaiti which is heavily driven by exogenous drivers. The following experiments are conducted using a HP EliteBook 8470p with Intel R  X  Core TM i5-3320M CPU 2.60 GHz  X  4 and 16GB RAM with Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS, Python 2.7.3, GNU Octave 3.2.4 and OpenJDK Java 7 Runtime. Ta-ble 1 is a summary of our Twitter datasets. Each tweet in the datasets includes a time-stamp at which it was posted in addition to its content and user name. The characteristics of Twitter large corpus is further explained by comparing with the dataset used in [31] where they are roughly one year apart. The dataset used in [31] comprises 130 million tweets posted between November 20, 2008 and May 27, 2009 from about 6.1 million users. The number of tweets with hash-tags is about 4.3 million, which is equivalent to 3.3% of the total number of tweets, and the average number of tweets per user is about 20.34. The messages in our Twitter large corpus were retrieved in 2010 (one year later). The number of tweets with hashtags had increased nearly fourfold to 11% out of the total number of tweets, and the average number of tweets per user was about 705. Although the number of users covered in Twitter large corpus is not as large as the dataset used in [31], its average number of tweets per user is more than 34 times of the latter.
We adopt a na  X   X ve approach to estimate R 0 of a hash-tag based on the SIR model described in Section 3.2. We estimate  X  by the reciprocal of average  X  X nfectious X  period (number of days) and estimate  X  by the average number of  X  X nfection X  per day. The  X  X nfectious X  period of a hashtag is defined as the time period between the first message that a user posts with a hashtag and the last message that he/she posts with the same hashtag. R 0 is then calculated as  X / X  by definition. The results of the selected hashtags from the Twitter small corpus are summarized in Table 2. Based on the SIR model, the expected epidemic outbreak dynamic pa-rameters of hashtag #current is  X  = 0 . 3250 and  X  = 0 . 1215. Its infectious counts are shown in Figure 6. Please note that it has a high dissimilarity with seasonal infectious disease, e.g., Figure 2(a) which fits well with SIR model.
We conduct topic discovery on the Twitter large corpus by using open source Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox version 0.4.0 3 . To estimate an appropriate number of background latent topics for this dataset, we select a small sample (  X  2 days) of tweets from each month and then execute PLDA modeling on the samples with the number of latent topics ranging from 1 to 20. The autoJSD series for the topic sets are summarized in Figure 7. All the autoJSD series exhibit similar patterns  X  they quickly climb to their peaks http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tmt/tmt-0.4/
Figure 6: New case counts of Hashtag #current between 3 X 7 number of background latent topics and then slowly decline. We split the monthly dataset into two sub-sets, based on whether a tweet is with or without hasthtags. We then apply PLDA topic modeling with 5 background la-tent topics on the portion which is with hashtags. Apart from topic definition, we also obtain a matrix of message-topic-distribution. Once the PLDA topic model is obtained, we apply the model to the second portion which is with-out hashtag for inference. Another matrix of message-topic-distribution is collected, which records the involvements of each message in each topic. For example, 1,557,134 of ad-ditional involvements are found in January 2010, which is 57.9% of the messages without hashtag and is equivalent to an average 264 per topic per day of additional discussion. We loop through the combined matrix in time order to cal-culate the total number of new cases in each day for all hash-tag topics. We repeat the same exercise for the rest of the months. A summary of the number of tweets with and with-out hashtags in each month and the number of hashtag top-ics discovered are captured in Table 3. We find the growth of the number of hashtag topics is much faster than the size of messages with hashtags; and hence, it is critical to take tweets without hashtag into consideration. The number of new case time-series of discovered hashtag topics in January 2010 are summarized in Figure 8 as an example. We can observe that some of the hashtag topics exhibit emerging-epidemic like patterns in the diagrams, but it is difficult to distinguish between them without a proper model. In this experiment, the run time of PLDA topic modeling is close to linear in the size of input data and also consistently outper-form LDA, which is in line with the theoretical value and findings in [40]. A comparison between LDA and PLDA with hashtags as labels is made by marrying up the topics in their topic sets by aggJSD with Hungarian method, where the matched topics with less than 20% of divergence are se-lected. In this experiment, only the messages with hashtags are used where the data are split into training and test sets 50:50 randomly. With the same number of topics in both Table 3: Hashtag topic discovery summary (January  X  June 2010) Figure 7: autoJSD vs number of background latent topics (January  X  June 2010) Figure 8: New case hashtag topics in January 2010 models, PLDA is found on average outperform LDA on pre-cision by 30.65% and on recall by 10.15% by comparing their inference accuracy on the test set.
We implement our emerging outbreak model outlined in Sections 3.3 and 4 by using an open source Bayesian-inference Python package 4 to estimate R out of the new case time-series obtained in Section 5.2. We first execute the pa-rameter estimation on all new case time-series of hashtag topics by using external influence equal to 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% or above. We obtain the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of  X  R in each time-step for all hashtag topics and also obtain their DIC values at the end. The ex-http://code.google.com/p/bayesian-inference/ Figure 9: Estimated external influence to hashtag topics in January 2010, in which 21.6% of the hash-tag topics are found to have 0% external influence, 19.5% have 10% external influence, 20.5% have 20% external influence, 22.6% have 30% external influ-ence, and 15.8% have  X  40% external influence Table 4: Top-20 hashtag topics ranked by their con-tagiousness (total excess  X  R ) in January 2010 ternal influence level to each hashtag topics is estimated by the ones with minimum DIC values as shown in Figure 9. By considering both endogenous and exogenous factors and using DIC for model selection, we achieve on average 70.12% reduction in DIC values relative to the model only consid-ering endogenous factors. Examples of  X  R time-series can be found in Figure 5. In addition, by using  X  R , we calculate the total excess  X  R of each hashtag topic to quantify their level of contagiousness. Excess  X  R is equal to the sum of  X  R  X  R t &gt; 1 and 0 for  X  R t  X  1. For example, January 2010 hashtag topics are ranked based on their contagiousness (total excess  X  R ) under an emerging outbreak model with zero external inference, and an emerging outbreak model with best esti-mated external inference. The top 20 hashtag topics found by the two models are reported in Table 4. The significant change in ranking is due to the effect between excluding and including exogenous factors from/into our model.

The effectiveness of  X  R in predicting emerging outbreaks of a hashtag topic is estimated by the number of alerts leading up to individual peak identified from the hashtag time-series. We adopt a simple approach where a point in a time-series is considered a maximum/minimum peak if it has the maxi-Table 5: Effectiveness check of  X  R in predicting emerging outbreaks of hashtag topics in January 2010 (topics are grouped by estimated % of external inference) mal/minimal value, and is preceded by a value lower/higher by 20 new cases. The results are summarized in Table 5. The percentage of peaks with prior alerts achieve in excess of 70% for topics with zero external inference; however, the percentage declines along with the increase in external infer-ence. The pattern of average prior alerts per peak is similar, starting from an average of 2.8 alerts down to 1.2. Since a measurement of intrinsic contagious of a topic, it is better be used to predict topics with less external inference.
This paper proposes a microblog emerging outbreak mon-itoring framework. First, we utilize topic model PLDA to include related tweets (without hashtags) to overcome the problem of low hashtag adoption rate. By analysing the new case topic data by a SIR model, we found that the diffusion patterns of hashtag topics are close to an emerging epidemic. Second, we enhance an emerging epidemic model by con-sidering both endogenous and exogenous drivers. Finally, based on the enhanced model, we propose an emerging out-break monitoring framework on Twitter by using Bayesian parameter estimation for dynamic systems. Experiment re-sults confirm the effectiveness of this monitoring framework. We foresee that the presented framework will be extremely valuable to public relations and marketing industries [43], political campaigns [32] etc., due to its intrinsic momen-tum identification capabilities. Future works involve better  X  B ( t ) estimation, the identification and elimination of vir-tual topics (spams), and to factor in relapses and seasonality. [1] R. Anderson and R. May.
