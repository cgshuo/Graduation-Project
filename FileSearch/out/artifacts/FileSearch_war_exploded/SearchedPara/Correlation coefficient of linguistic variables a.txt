 Shing-Chung Ngan n 1. Introduction between two variables of interest (say the efficiency of removing certain chemical compounds versu s the amount of catalysts avail-able) is commonly used to quantify the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables. In many real world applica-tions, however, an observation on an entity is oftentimes described in terms of vague and imprecise concepts (e.g., see Alaqtash et al., 2011 , Chau, 2005 , Cheng and Chau, 2001 , Cheng et al., 2002 , Lee and Li, 2011 , Singh and Benyoucef, 2011 , Zouggari and Benyoucef, 2012 ).
Formally, such an observation can be viewed as a fuzzy linguistic variable whose domain is a collection of pre-specified fuzzy linguis-tic concepts ( Herrera and Martinez, 2000a , 2000b ; Zimmermann, 2001 ). For example, in evaluating the innovativeness of a new product idea, a fuzzy linguistic variable can be used to represent the rating given by an expert, and the domain of the variable would and excellent . It has been of considerable interest to extend the standard correlation coefficient to the fuzzy setting, so that the correlation between two fuzzy linguistic variables, such as the innovativeness of a product idea and the perceived organizational capacity to realize that product idea, can be quantified ( Bustince and Burillo, 1995 ; Chiang and Lin, 1999 ; Gerstenkorn and Manko, 1991 ; Hong and Hwang, 1995 ; Wang and Li, 1999 ; Yu, 1993 ). As Liu and Kao (2002) pointed out, the works of Bustince and
Burillo (1995) , Gerstenkorn and Manko (1991) , Hong and Hwang (1995) , Wang and Li (1999) and Yu (1993) suffered from the deficiency that the correlation coefficient lies in the domain [0,1], as opposed to the conventional range of [ 1,1]. On the other hand, while the correlation coefficient proposed in Chiang and Lin (1999) is within [ 1,1], it is a crisp number and thus the sense of fuzziness is lost. Hence, based on Zadeh 0 s extension principle,
Liu and Kao (2002) developed a new correlation coefficient, which is a fuzzy number when at least one observation is fuzzy. In their method, a mathematical programming approach based on a pair of non-linear programs is used to compute the a -cuts of their fuzzy correlation coefficient. Subsequently, Hong (2006) refined the computational aspect of Liu and Kao 0 s method such that their fuzzy correlation coefficient can be determined without the aid of mathematical programming. However, the approaches of Liu and
Kao (2002) and Hong (2006) remain problematic in that the membership function of the resultant fuzzy correlation coefficient can exceed the range [ 1,1], as it was shown in an example in
Hong 0 s 2006 paper. Furthermore, while some formulations of fuzzy correlation coefficient (e.g., the centroid method of Hung and Wu, 2002 ) do result in the coefficient lying within the [ 1,1] range, it is not clear how the postulates in those methods translate to what assumptions are actually imposed on the data. In fact, correlation measures for fuzzy variables proposed in the literature commonly do not possess mechanisms to accommodate the possibly different types of conditional dependence relations underlying given data sets ( Hsu and Wu, 2010 ; Hung and Wu, 2007 ; Leu et al., 2008 ; Mitchell, 2004 , 2006 ; Park et al., 2009a ; Park et al., 2009b ; Szmidt and Kacprzyk, 2010 ; Ye, 2010 ). More generally, in working strictly within the framework of Zadeh 0 s extension principle, theory development for fuzzy sets is highly non-trivial. For instance, substantial efforts are still being expended by various researchers in developing methodologies for foundational tasks such as ranking fuzzy numbers and defining arithmetic and logical operations on fuzzy numbers, resulting in a multitude of differing approaches ( Abbasbandy and Hajjari, 2009 ; Chakraborty and Chakraborty, 2006 ; Chen and Sanguansat, 2011 ; Chu and Lin, 2009 ; Chu and Tsao, 2002 ; Hong, 2007 ; Kechagias and Papadopoulos, 2007 ; Kumar et al., 2011 ; Liu et al., 2008 ; Matarazzoa and Munda, 2001 ; Oussalah, 2002 ; Voxman, 1998 ). Extending the concept of correlation coefficient to the fuzzy setting is no exception. On the other hand, we have shown that by interpreting the membership function of a linguistic concept based on a probabilistic framework, and by abandoning Zadeh 0 sextension principle in favor of relying on probabilistic arguments, much of the technical difficulties in developing theory involving linguistic vari-ables can be bypassed ( Ngan, 2011a , submitted for publication-a ), with the resulting probabilistic linguistic computing (PLC) frame-work enabling a uniform approach for theory development. As this article will show, the PLC framework allows one to develop a correlation measure for linguistic variables that can account for and reflect the conditional dependence assumptions underlying a given data set, in addition to the advantages that the measure does not produce the undesirable artifact having results outside of the range [ 1,1], and that the measure is developed methodologically under the well-established axiomatic basis of probability.

A principal application of the proposed method is the analysis of engineering management phenomena, as data from this domain are not uncommon to be of vague and imprecise nature ( Park et al., method to compute the correlation coefficient on a real industrial data set to quantify the strength of relation between technology and management achievements for 15 large-scale machinery firms in Taiwan, as part of an engineering management study.
This article is organized as follows: the whole of Section 2 will be devoted to reviewing the probabilistic interpretation of a linguistic set and the sampling distribution of such a set (previously described in Ngan, 2011a , submitted for publication-a ). Then, the method of deriving correlation measures of a given pair of linguistic variables, which is a distinct development from ( Ngan, 2011a , submitted for publication-a ) and is built upon the PLC framework delineated in Section 2 , will be described in Section 3  X  the reader is invited to see ( Ngan, 2011a , submitted for publication-a ) for the applications of the PLC framework to other areas. In Section 4 , we will apply the proposed method to an engineering management study concerning large-scale machinery firms in Taiwan. Finally, discussion and sug-gestions for further development will be given in Section 5 . 2. Basic methodologies for linguistic sets 2.1. A linguistic set
The characteristic function of a classical set assigns a value of either 0 or 1 to a given object, indicating whether the object is a member of that set. In contrast, a linguistic set, like the fuzzy set ( Zimmermann, 2001 ), is endowed with a membership function which assigns a value in the range [0,1] to a given object, denoting the grade of membership of that object to the linguistic set. An example of a linguistic set is a so-called triangular linguistic number H , characterized by the membership function f  X  x  X  X  where x is a real number (see Fig. 1 (a)). Following Ngan (2011a) , for concreteness, let us regard H as representing a Person A 0 s linguistic concept of an average-height individual, with x being the height of the individual under consideration. (Throughout this article, we will use the terms linguistic set and linguistic concept interchangeably.) Then, that individual with his associated height x will be considered by Person A as having  X  X  X verage height X  X  to a degree determined by the membership function: an individual with height x  X  q is definitely a member of the concept H according to Person A (as f H ( q )  X  1.0), whereas an individual with
In general, the domain of the membership function of a linguistic set can take on R n or other sets. In the special case when the domain is in R , the corresponding linguistic set is termed a linguistic number. Referring to Fig. 1 a, q is a  X  X  X risp X  X  number, whereas H is a linguistic number whose value is  X  X  X round X  X  q . (Note that while triangular membership functions have been frequently used in the fuzzy linguistic computing literature (see Mart X nez and Herrera, 2012 and the references therein), the subsequent formulation described in this article does not restrict membership functions to be of any particular shape, as we will see in Section 4 , where the method is applied to engineering management data).
Thus far, the definition of a linguistic set is identical to that of a fuzzy set. A key difference between the two is that in the rest of this article, theory development for linguistic sets and linguistic variables will be based on probabilistic arguments, in place of
Zadeh 0 s extension principle. We therefore introduce the termi-nology linguistic set to distinguish it from fuzzy set . 2.2. Probabilistic interpretation of a linguistic set of a linguistic set will be interpreted probabilistically. For con-creteness, let us again consider the  X  X  X verage height X  X  concept H discussed in Section 2.1 . Suppose that in a scenario (labeled as scenario 1), a Friend B of Person A gathers one hundred indivi-duals, each with an actual height q . Without informing A of their actual heights, B presents these one hundred individuals to A one by one, each time requesting A to make a binary decision of whether the individual presented is of  X  X  X verage height X  X . A , following his subjective concept of an  X  X  X verage-height indivi-dual X  X , would end up judging all one hundred of these individuals to be of  X  X  X verage height X  X , since the value of the membership function of his concept  X  X  X verage height X  X  at x  X  q is 1. Now, in a scenario 2, suppose that the above experiment is repeated, with the difference that B now gathers one hundred individuals each with an actual height ( p  X  q )/2. In this case, A will classify only about half of them as having  X  X  X verage height X  X  according to his subjective concept, because the value of the membership function the value of the membership function at the height of interest gives the probability that an individual with that height will be classified as having  X  X  X verage height X  X  in A 0 s binary decision, i.e. P  X  H 9 x  X  X  f H  X  x  X  X  2  X  value of 0 or 1, the corresponding probability will be 0 or 100%. 2.3. Sampling distribution of a linguistic set Sections 2.1 and 2.2 gives
P  X  x 9 H  X  X  P  X  H
B but not by A ), the term P ( H 9 x ) refers to the probability that A will classify that individual as having  X  X  X verage height X  X , and is characterized by the membership function f H ( x ), as we have just discussed in Section 2.2 . P ( x 9 H ) gives the probability of an individual possessing a particular actual height x given that the individual has already been classified by A as having  X  X  X verage height X  X . Last but not least, P ( x ) represents the prior probability of encountering an individual with a particular actual height x in our universe of discourse. A model for this prior probability can be specified based on knowledge or assumption about the actual height distribution of the individuals in the universe of discourse. a number of individuals and concluded that one hundred of them have  X  X  X verage height X  X . We can then deduce that the actual height distribution of the one hundred individuals follows the distribu-tion stipulated by P ( x 9 H ). Moreover, let us denote the full range of heights of the individuals in our universe of discourse as a rapidly varying function over the domain D , and when (ii) the size of the support S H of the membership function f H is not large relative to D , it is reasonable to approximate P ( x ) as constant across S H . Then Eq. (3) can be simplified to P  X  x 9 H  X  p P  X  H 9 x  X  X  4  X 
We note that the right hand side of Eq. (4) corresponds to the membership function f H ( x ). By normalizing f H ( x ) into that the area under the resulting curve equals one, the actual height distribution P ( x 9 H ) can be written as
P  X  x 9 H  X  X  ^ f H  X  x  X  X  5 : 1  X  with ^ f  X  x  X  X 
P ( x 9 H ) will herein be referred to as the sampling distribution of the linguistic number H (see Fig. 1 (b)). While conditions (i) and (ii) are relatively mild and it is reasonable to assume they be satisfied in most approximate reasoning applications involving linguistic sets, still the present framework allows for the incor-poration of a specific model for P ( x ) if one is to be prescribed by the user. In that case, according to Eq. (3), Eq. (4) will be replaced with
P  X  x 9 H  X  p P  X  H 9 x  X  P  X  x  X  f w H  X  x  X  X  6  X  where f w H  X  x  X  f H  X  x  X  P  X  x  X  can be termed a weighted membership function. For this situation, the correct formula for the sampling distribution P ( x 9 H ) is obtained by normalizing f w H such that the area under the resulting curve equals one  X  here, as one can see, is an example that assumptions about given data can be methodologically accommodated. 3. Correlation coefficient between two linguistic variables
Recall from Section 1 that a linguistic variable is a variable whose domain consists of pre-specified linguistic concepts. For example, in the case of a customer rating the food quality of a seafood dinner (on the scale of 0 to 1) he just had, instead of committing to a crisp value representing his opinion, his food quality rating can instead be represented by a linguistic variable q and the domain of q f would consist of the linguistic concepts terrible , bad , average , good and excellent . These five linguistic concepts can be assumed to be corresponding to the five linguistic numbers depicted in Fig. 2 (a). (As we will illustrate in Section 4 , the present framework does not restrict to membership functions to be of any particular shape. The triangular membership func-tions are used in the present example only for the sake of concreteness.) For example, if the dinner is judged to be good , the variable q f will take on the linguistic number T 3 . In short, the linguistic concept good enables the customer to express his opinion while relieving him from the burden of needing to specify a particular crisp value (say 0.8) to describe his subjective rating.
Similarly, if the customer is to rate the service quality of the restaurant where he just had the dinner, the linguistic variable can be q s and the domain of q s would consist of the linguistic terms highly unsatisfactory , unsatisfactory , average , satisfactory , and highly satisfactory (see Fig. 2 (b)).

Our goal is to quantify the correlation between two linguistic variables, e.g. the food quality of a seafood dinner q f and the service quality of the restaurant q s . To be specific, let us consider a small data set collected from the above-mentioned customer. The small data set consists of the dining experiences of the customer at 10 different seafood restaurants ( Table 1 ). For example, his experience at Restaurant 5 is summarized as good food ( q and highly satisfactory service ( q s  X  S 4 ). We are interested in determining the correlation coefficient, i.e. the strength of the linear relation, between the linguistic variables q f and q
In order to achieve our goal, we will convert the initial problem, i.e. the quantification of the correlation between two linguistic variables (Problem I), into an associated problem, i.e. the determination of the sampling distribution of the correlation coefficient of the two linguistic variables (Problem II). We then convert the sampling distribution to a corresponding membership function, thus yielding a numerical solution to Problem I.
For concreteness, let us refer to a specific entry in Table 1  X  the food quality rating of restaurant 1 being q 1 f  X  T 2 . Analogous to Eq. (2) and according to Fig. 2 (a), the probabilistic interpretation of the linguistic rating T 2 is captured by the relation P  X  T 2 9 ~ q 1 f  X  X  f T 2  X  ~ q 1 f  X  X  f q 1 with f  X  ~ q 1 f  X  X  f T 2  X  ~ q 1 f  X  X  where ~ q 1 f can be viewed as an intrinsic numeric food quality index (analogous to the intrinsic actual height of an individual in the scenarios discussed in Section 2 ). Recall from scenario 3of Section 2.3 that given N individuals already judged by Person A to be of  X  X  X verage these N individuals. Corre spondingly, imagine that there are N restaurants, each having the same food quality rating T 2 distribution of the numeric food qu ality indices of these restaurants can be described by the distribution P  X  ~ q 1 f 9 q 1 f  X  T 2  X  X  ^ f T 2  X  ~ q 1 f  X  X  ^ f q 1 with ^ f  X  ~ q f  X  X  analogous to Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2) .

Now, to actually generate enough sample values that will enable us to compute the sampling distribution of the correlation coeffi-cient between food quality and service quality across the 10 restaurants, imagine that we have N sets of 10 restaurants, with each set possessing the same linguistic ratings as in Table 1 .Then, the sample values of the intrinsic food and service quality indices for each set of the 10 restaurants can be randomly generated based on
P  X  ~ q , ~ q 1 s , :: , ~ q 10 f , ~ q 10 s 9 q 1 f  X  T 2 , q 1 s probability yields
P  X  ~ q , ~ q 1 s , :: , ~ q 10 f , ~ q 10 s 9 q 1 f  X  T 2 , q 1 s  X  P  X  ~ q 1 f 9 ~ q 1 s , ~ q 2 f , ~ q 2 s , :: , ~ q 10
If we assume that the random samplings of the food and service quality indices of one restaurant are independent of the random samplings of the food and service quality indices of the other restaurants, as well as independent of the food and service linguistic ratings of the other restaurants, then
P  X  ~ q 9 ~ q 1 s , ~ q 2 f , ~ q 2 s , :: , ~ q 10 f , ~ q 10 s , q  X  P  X  ~ q 1 f 9 ~ q 1 s , q 1 f  X  T 2 , q 1 s  X  S 1  X  X  11 : 1  X 
P  X  ~ q 9 ~ q 2 f , ~ q 2 s , :: , ~ q 10 f , ~ q 10 s , q 1 f  X  T 2  X  P  X  ~ q 1 s 9 q 1 f  X  T 2 , q 1 s  X  S 1  X  X  11 : 2  X 
P  X  ~ q 9 ~ q 10 s , q 1 f  X  T 2 , q 1 s  X  S 1 , :: , q 10 f  X  T 4
P  X  ~ q 10 s 9 q 1 f  X  T 2 , q 1 s  X  S 1 , :: , q 10 f  X  T simplification
P  X  ~ q 1 f , ~ q 1 s , :: , ~ q 10 f , ~ q 10 s 9 q 1 f  X  T restaurant is independent of the service quality rating of the same restaurant, then, e.g. for Restaurant 1
P  X  ~ q 1 f 9 ~ q 1 s , q 1 f  X  T 2 , q 1 s  X  S 1  X  X  P  X  ~ q index vis-a-vis the food quality rating yields
P  X  ~ q 1 s 9 q 1 f  X  T 2 , q 1 s  X  S 1  X  X  P  X  ~ q 1 s 9 q to
P  X  ~ q 1 f , ~ q 1 s , :: , ~ q 10 f , ~ q 10 s 9 q 1 f  X  T
With these assumptions and the assumption that the prior the supports of the corresponding membership functions f q i
 X 
Section 2.3 ), the membership function for the correlation measure can be written as with where M cc is the normalizing factor ensuring that max
To determine the membership function f cc ( r ) numerically, we apply the following procedure: using Eq. (14) , each of the N sets of the 10 restaurants will yield a set of 20 sample values ~ q
Each set of the sample values will in turn allow us to compute a sample value c ~ c j of the correlation coefficient: c ~ c sample values c ~ c 1 ,.., c ~ c N enable us to approximate the sampling distribution of the correlation coefficient between the food quality ratings and the service quality ratings of the 10 restaurants. By normalizing the sampling distribution based on Eq. (15.2) ,an numerical solution to Eq. (15.1) , i.e. the membership function for the correlation between the linguistic variables q f and q obtained.

Note that if for some situation we decide not to make certain assumptions (e.g., the indepe ndence assumptions of Eqs. (11.1) X (11.4) and/or those of Eqs. (13.1) and (13.2)) ,wesimply need to supply appropriate mathematical models to describe the stipulated relations between the v ariables. Then, by incorporating these models into Eqs. (9) and (10) , the sampling distribution and subsequently the membership function of the correlation coefficient can still be determined numerically. (On the other hand, for approaches such as the ones described in Hong (2006) , Hung and
Wu (2002) and Liu and Kao (2002) , this is not obvious how the approaches should be modified to account for changes in the underlying assumptions about the given data.) To further demon-strate this flexibility of the present framework in accounting for underlying assumptions, let us visit an alternative formulation of the correlation coefficient between tw o linguistic variable variables where we employ a different condi tional dependence assumption: specifically, in Ngan (submitted for publication-b) , a methodology to re-express the standard fuzzy set and fuzzy arithmetic operations within the PLC setting so as to reveal the implicit conditional dependence assumptions of these operations has been described.
The standard fuzzy set and arithmet ic operations considered were: f
H \ K  X  x  X  X  min f f H  X  x  X  , f K  X  x  X g X  17  X  f
H [ K  X  x  X  X  max f f H  X  x  X  , f K  X  x  X g X  18  X  f
H  X  K  X  z  X  X  sup z  X  x  X  y min f f H  X  x  X  , f K  X  y  X g X  19  X  and f H K  X  z  X  X  sup z  X  x y min f f H  X  x  X  , f K  X  y  X g X  20  X 
Eqs. (17) and (18) give the standard definitions of the member-ship functions for the intersection and the union of two fuzzy sets respectively, whereas Eqs. (19) and (20) describe the standard definitions of addition and multiplication of two fuzzy numbers respectively ( Zimmermann, 2001 ). These standard definitions were shown in Ngan (submitted for publication-b) to possess the following implicit conditional dependence assumption:
For two given linguistic concepts H and K and for a given pair of objects x (with membership value m H associated with H ) and y (with membership value m K associated with K ), say the membership value of the object x with respect to its associated linguistic concept (i.e. m H ) is not larger than that of object y with respect to y 0 s associated linguistic concept (i.e., m if object x has already been classified as an instance of H in a binary decision making, object y will also be surely classified as an instance of K in another binary decision making. In equation form, the above statement is equivalent to P  X  K 9 y , H , x  X  X  1 if f H  X  x  X  r f K  X  y  X  X  21 : 1  X  and P  X  H 9 x , K , y  X  X  1 if f K  X  y  X  r f H  X  x  X  X  21 : 2  X 
Now, to formulate a correlation measure for linguistic vari-ables in the PLC framework so that such a measure possesses a type of conditional dependence assumption analogous to the one implicitly used in the standard fuzzy set and arithmetic opera-tions, one will have f  X  r  X  X  where F  X  ~ q i f , ~ q i s  X  X  and M Z In short, the PLC framework enables us to derive both Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) and (22.1) X (22.3) as possible definitions of the correlation measure for the linguistic variables q
To recap, the assumptions used in deriving Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) consist of Eqs. (11.1) X (11.4) and (13.1) and (13.2) , whereas those that were used in deriving Eq. (22.1) X (22.3) follow the conditional dependence assumption implicitly used in standard fuzzy set/ arithmetic operations. Also, both the derivations of Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) and (22.1) X (22.3) depend on assumptions analogous to conditions (i) and (ii) discussed in Section 2.3 . To decide which of these equations to employ in computing correlation depends on whether or not one desires to follow the assumption implicitly used in the standard fuzzy operators, and whether other condi-tional dependence assumptions (such as that of Eqs. (11.1) X (11.4) and (13.1) and (13.2) are more appropriate in characterizing the given data. Moreover, formulation of correlation measure distinct from those of Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) and (22.1) X (22.3) is also possible under the PLC framework, as long as the desired condi-tional dependence structure is identified and supplied.
In the following section, we will first use the definition given in Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) to compute the correlation coefficient between two linguistic variables describing an engineering man-agement data set. Afterwards, we will repeat the correlation coefficient computation using the definition delineated in
Eqs. (22.1) X (22.3) , and then compare the results. 4. Determining the correlation coefficient between technology and management In Kao and Liu (1999) and Liu and Kao (2002) , 15 large-scale
Taiwanese machinery firms, each having an annual earning exceeding one hundred million New Taiwan dollars before inter-est and taxes, were studied in terms of their levels of technology and management achievements. Specifically, using linguistic terms, the experts rated how much each of these firms has achieved in the various aspects of the technology and manage-ment. Additionally, the experts rated the relative importance of each of the aspects itself using linguistic terms. The data collected were then aggregated, yielding two linguistic numbers for each firm, with the membership functions of these linguistic numbers describing the overall technology and the overall management achievements of the firm respectively  X  see Tables 2 and 3 . ( Table 2 of the present article reproduces Table 1 in Liu and Kao (2002) , whereas Table 3 reproduces Table 2 in Liu and Kao (2002) ). Note that instead of fully specifying the membership functions of the linguistic numbers, only achievement indices associated with specific membership values are described in these tables. For simplicity and with minimal loss of accuracy, we linearly interpolate these indices to obtain the full membership functions  X  see Fig. 3 for an example of how we obtain the membership function for the linguistic number characterizing the overall technology achievement level of Firm 1.
 analogy, in our present situation, we now have 15 firms instead of 10 restaurants, and with data from Table 2 replacing those of the  X  X  X ood quality rating X  X  column in Table 1 , and with data from Table 3 replacing those of the  X  X  X ervice quality rating X  X  column in Table 1 . The computation procedure described immediately after
Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) in Section 3 is then used to determine the sampling distribution of the correlation coefficient between the technology and management achievements of the 15 firms. The resulting distribution is shown in Fig. 4 (a). We then obtain the membership function f cc ( r ) for the correlation coefficient by  X  X  X enormalizing X  X  the curve of Fig. 4 (a) such that the peak of the curve takes on the membership value 1, leading to Fig. 4 (b), which shows the graph of the membership function f cc ( r ) as defined in
Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) . (We note that for practical purposes such as testing whether the correlation coefficient is significantly larger than 0, sampling distribution of the correlation coefficient, rather than its corresponding membership function, is what we really need to operate on.) The relation between Fig. 4 (a) and (b) (i.e., sampling distribution versus membership function) is analo-gous to the relation between Fig. 1 (b) and (a).

Referring to Fig. 4 (a), the support of the resulting sampling distribution is well within [-0.4,0.8]. Furthermore, the area to the left of the line L and underneath the sampling distribution curve is 0.0142  X  this number can be viewed as the p -value correspond-ing to the hypothesis that the correlation coefficient is larger than 0. Thus, we conclude that under the definition encoded in Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) , there is a positive correlation between the overall technology and management achievement levels of the 15 firms at the significance level of 0.05. In contrast, the support of the corresponding fuzzy correlation coefficient in Liu and Kao (2002) has a very broad range (from 0.8281 to 0.9862  X  see Fig. 3 Liu and Kao., 2002 ). Since their formulation did not provideadirectwaytocompute p -values, the authors could only make a qualitative statement suggesting that  X  X  X he correlation between technology and management is rather low X  X  based on their qualitative observations on several indices discussed in their paper.

Now, we repeat the calculation of correlation coefficient between the overall technology and management achievement levels of the 15 firms using the definition given in Eqs. (22.1) X (22.3) .
Fig. 4 (c) and (b) depict the resulting sampling distribution and area to the left of Line L and underneath the sampling distribution curve is 0.0251. Therefore, like the preceding analysis based on Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) , we conclude that the correlation coefficient is larger than 0 at the 0.05 significance level. On the other hand, unlike the preceding analysis, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no correlation between the technology and management achievement levels of these firms at the 0.02 significance level.
In other words, a different choice of a linguistic correlation measure could have led to a different result in acceptance/ rejection of a hypothesis, and therefore, it is important to employ appropriate conditional dependence assumptions in deriving an appropriate linguistic correlation measure for a given situation.
The PLC framework has enough flexibility to accommodate various types of conditional dependence assumptions, whereas it is unclear how to modify the postulated correlation measures such as those of Liu and Kao (2002) , Hung and Wu (2002) or
Hong (2006) to account for the differing characteristics of given data sets.

Moreover, we apply the definition given in Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) to determine the correlation between Linseed oil and
Perilla oil in the Fats and oils data set discussed in Hong (2006) . (The raw data is shown in Table 4 , reproducing the relevant part of Table 1 in Hong, 2006 ) The resulting sampling distribution and membership function corresponding to the correlation are depicted in Fig. 5 (a) and (b)  X  the support of the distribution is well within [0.94,1.0]. The application of the definition of correla-tion coefficient encoded in Eqs. (22.1) X (22.3) to the Fats and oils data set yields highly similar results (not shown to conserve space). In contrast, the support of the corresponding fuzzy correlation coefficient as shown in Figure 1 of Hong (2006) exceeds 1.0, and it is not obvious how to minimally repair the postulated measure in order to eliminate the undesirable artifact of having correlation coefficient larger than 1.0.
 5. Discussions and conclusion quantify the linear relation between two given variables of interest in crisp industrial data. However, in many real world observations involving the opinions of experts, the domain of a variable of interest, e.g. the rating of the innovativeness of a new product idea, is oftentimes composed of subjective linguistic concepts such as very poor , poor , average , good and excellent .
Therefore, it is of theoretical as well as practical interest to extend the standard correlation coefficient to the subjective, linguistic setting, so as to quantify relations in imprecise industrial and management data.
 researchers in developing methodologies for computing correlation between fuzzy variables, among other fundamental tasks such as ranking fuzzy numbers, and defini ng arithmetic and logical opera-tions on fuzzy numbers. In general, method developments for these and other elementary operations in fuzzy sets are highly challenging when working strictly within the framework of Zadeh 0 sextension principle. Thus, in this article, to develop a correlation coefficient to measure linear relation between linguistic variables, we worked within the probabilistic setting in place of Zadeh 0 sextension princi-ple. While correlation measures for fuzzy variables proposed in the literature commonly do not posse ss mechanisms to accommodate the possibly different types of con ditional dependence relations underlying given data sets, the present framework allows one to develop a correlation measure for linguistic variables that can account for various conditional dependence assumptions, in addition to having the advantages that the measure does not produce the undesirable artifact of yielding results outside of the range [ 1,1], and that the measure is developed methodologically under the well-established axiomatic basis of probability. We demonstrated the application of the proposed me thod to quantifying the degree of correlation between the overall technology and management achievement levels of 15 large-s cale machinery firms in Taiwan.
A limitation of the current method is that it is highly non-trivial to obtain closed form results for the correlation measures (e.g.,
Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) and (22.1) X (22.3) ) derived under the PLC framework. Thus, at present, numerical computation is the primary resort to obtaining answers. Since closed form results often lead to better and more intuitive understanding of the phenomena under examination (which is especially important for domains with vague data like engineering management) , a future work is to investigate which types of simplifications could lead to reduction to closed forms, and also to characterize the assumptions these simplifications would be placing on the given data. A nother limitation of the current methodisthatitsprimaryfocusisonprovidingaflexibleand methodological framework to account for various possible types of conditional dependence structures underlying the phenomena of interest. As such, determining the most suitable dependence struc-ture to incorporate into a specific computation will be task-dependent and be relied upon the user 0 s experience and best judgment with his/her domain of investigation. The topic of model/ parameter selection is beyond th e scope of the present study, but building upon approaches su ch as the ones described in Chau (2004) and Chen and Chau (2006) maylikelyleadtofruitfuladvances.
Currently, we are extending the present formulation to quantify partial correlation coefficients among linguistic variables. With the partial correlation measure, we can then disentangle direct versus indirect associative relations among a given set of subjective observations made on entities of interest. In other words, this will enable us to understand the web of qualitative, structural relations within a given industrial or management domain involving impre-cise data. In particular, we intend to apply this type of partial correlation computations to the full engineering management data set involving the 15 large-scale Taiwanese machinery firms, to further probe the detailed, directed relations among the various facets of technology and management achievements. Also, we envision that the PLC framework can be extended to other applica-tions domain involving linguistic sets, such as developing similarity measures in case-based approximate reasoning.
