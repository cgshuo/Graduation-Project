 The amount of structured content published on the Web has been growing rapidly, making it possible to address in-creasingly complex information access tasks. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of large scale human-curated knowledge bases as well as a growing array of techniques that identify or extract information automatically from un-structured and semi-structured sources. The ESAIR work-shop series aims to advance the general research agenda on the problem of creating and exploiting semantic anno-tations. The eighth edition of ESAIR sets its focus on ap-plications. We dedicate a special  X  X nnotations in action X  track to demonstrations that showcase innovative prototype systems, in addition to the regular research and position pa-per contributions. The workshop also features invited talks from leaders in the field. The desired outcome of ESAIR X 15 is a roadmap and research agenda that guides academic ef-forts and aligns them with industrial directions and devel-opments.

The accepted contributions cover a wide spec-trum of topics related to semantic annotations and informa-tion retrieval, including: healthcare, automatic translation, semantic search, question answering, knowledge profiling, topic modeling, contextual enrichment, named entity dis-ambiguation, temporal tagging, and semantic annotation of video content. Out of the 19 submissions, the committee accepted a total of 10 papers (5 regular, 2 position, and 3 demo papers) to be presented at the workshop. In addition to the regular paper presentations and demonstration ses-sion, the programme includes invited talks by experts in the field, which will focus on the uprising challenges in semantic information access and retrieval. The workshop is intended to be highly interactive where everyone contributes and is planned to inspire the attendees to think  X  X utside the box. X  Thus, the workshop will include focused discussion sessions at which researchers with similar interests can showcase their ideas and concerns. A final wrap-up session will conclude the event with the objective to formulate critical insights into the potential of semantic annotations, the barriers to success, and specific steps to take this research forward. We continue with the tradition of earlier ESAIR editions and or-ganize a social event for further, more informal discussions among workshop participants and other CIKM attendees.
