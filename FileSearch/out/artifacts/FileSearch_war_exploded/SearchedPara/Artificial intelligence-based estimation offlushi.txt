 1. Introduction
Sediment deposition in dam reservoirs decreases their water storage capacity and functional ef fi ciency for fl ow regulation and fl ood control ( Graf, 1984 ). As time passes, the rising level of sediment deposition in the vicinity of the dam wall increases the risk of sediment intrusion into the power plants intakes, which ultimately leads to sever abrasion of hydraulic machinery like segments and turbines. Deposition of sediment may also clog the bottom outlets ( Schleiss et al., 1996 ).

To date, several techniques have been proposed to manage accumulated sediments in reservoirs. These contain catchment management, density current venting, fl ushing, dredging, and sluicing ( Brandt, 2000 ). Among these techniques, fl ushing is one of the most ef fi cient one to remove deposited sediment in reservoir through the bottom outlet ( Shen and Lai, 1996 ). Flushing technique can be classi fi ed into free-fl ow fl ushing and pressure ment is removed by empting all storage volume of reservoir, in which the in fl ow water is routed along reservoir and then is discharged from bottom outlet. This results in large-scale scouring arti fi cial intelligence-based methods namely, Arti fi cial Neural Net-work (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are utilized as alternative methods to the conventional regression-based approaches to estimate the fl ushing half-cone geometry.
Over the last decade, ANN and ANFIS have been employed in a number of sediment related problems such as estimation of scour hole geometry around the bridge piers ( Pal et al., 2011 ), down-stream of culverts, sluice gates and spillway ( Azamathulla et al., 2008 ), and around a group of piles ( Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2009 ). However, to the best knowledge of authors, no other study has applied ANN and ANFIS to predict the geometry of fl ushing half-cone.

This paper is organized as follows. A brief background on the mechanism of pressure fl ushing is presented in Section 2 . Section 3 explains the experimental data and their exploitation (original versus non-dimensional) in the ANN and ANFIS models. Results associated with original and non-dimensional input data are described in Subsections 4.1 and 4.2 , respectively. Subsection 4.3 compares the results of ANN and ANFIS with those of previous studies. In Section 5 , a sensitivity analysis is performed to under-stand the relative importance of hydraulic variables on the formation of fl ushing half-cone. Finally, conclusions are reported in Section 6 . 2. Background
Numerous studies for the mechanism of pressure fl ushing were reported in the literature. Among these, Hotchkiss (1989) showed that without suf fi cient drawdown in fl ushing operation, only a local scour area was formed and the corresponding recovery in reservoir storage capacity was very small. Fang and Cao (1996) indicated that a huge amount of sediment is fl ushed out at the initiation of fl ushing operation. Once the fl ushing half-cone is formed, the out fl ow from the bottom outlet contains negligible amount of sediment and is almost clear. Scheuerlein et al. (2004) pointed out that the water level in reservoir should be drawn down suf fi ciently in order to have a successful continuation of the fl ushing process. They also mentioned that the development of fl ushing half-cone from the beginning until it reaches to an equilibrium condition is fast, and the whole process occurs only in about 1  X  10 min in different experiments. Later, Emamgholizadeh (2005) found that the ef fi ciency of pressurized fl ushing is max-imized by reducing the water level in the reservoir. He also reported that the ef fi ciency of pressurized fl ushing reaches its peak when the bottom outlets are fully open.

Meshkati et al. (2010) illustrated that at a given discharge from the bottom outlet, the volume and length of fl ushing half-cone increase by increasing the bottom outlet cross section. They also indicated that the thickness of deposited sediment plays a domi-nant role in the geometry of fl ushing half-cone. Finally, they proposed the following empirical expressions for the estimation of fl ushing half-cone length and volume.
 L
H  X  1 : 98 H s V
H where L and V are the length and volume of fl ushing half-cone, H is the thickness of deposited sediment, H W is the depth of water in reservoir, u is the fl ow velocity through bottom outlet, D is the bottom outlet diameter, g is the gravitational acceleration, and G and d 50 are respectively the speci fi c gravity and mean grain diameter of deposited sediment (see Fig. 1 ).
 hidden layer(s) is one of the most important and dif fi cult tasks ( Baziar and Ghorbani, 2011 ). In this study, the optimal structure was speci fi ed by changing the number of hidden nodes from 1 to 8, and picking the ANN structure that leads to the best results. The
ANN training was stopped when maximum iterations of 10,000 were reached.

Besides the number of hidden nodes, the transfer function between nodes also affects the performance of ANN model.
Therefore, the ANN model was run with different transfer func-tions including Sigmoid ( f  X  x  X  X  1 =  X  1  X  e  X  x  X  ), Gaussian ( f ( f  X  x  X  X  sec h  X  x  X  ). Comparison of results with the aforementioned transfer functions and different hidden nodes indicated that the
ANN model with the Hyperbolic Secant transfer function and hidden nodes gives the best results (i.e., the least MAE and RMSE and highest R 2 values). The estimated volume and length of fl ushing half-cone from the best ANN model are shown in Fig. 3 for both training and testing phases. The results show that the
ANN model has a very small MAE and RMSE during training phase; however these values were somewhat higher during the testing (validation) phase. The predicted volume and length of fl
MFs were Gaussian, the learning algorithm was hybrid, and the output MF was constant.

The predicted volume and length of fl ushing half-cone are shown versus the observed ones in Fig. 4 for both training and testing datasets. As illustrated, ANFIS has performed well in predicting the length of fl ushing half-cone both in training (MAE  X  0.015 m, RMSE  X  0.019 m and R 2  X  0.961), and testing phases (MAE  X  0.016 m, RMSE  X  0.021 m and R 2  X  0.920). Also, it has performed relatively well for estimating the volume of ing half-cone in testing phase (MAE  X  0.005 m 3 , RMSE  X  0.008 m and R 2  X  0.892). Comparing the results of ANFIS with those of ANN (discussed in Section 4.1.1 ) reveals that ANN performs slightly better than ANFIS. 4.2. Non-dimensional dataset 4.2.1. ANN
Following the study of Fathi-Moghadam et al. (2010) , two non-dimensional parameters (i.e., as inputs to ANN in order to estimate the normalized volume ( ffiffiffiffi p training and testing results for the ANN model. As shown, the model has performed relatively well in predicting the normalized volume of fl ushing half-cone in both training (MAE  X  0.591, RMSE  X  0.720 and R 2  X  0.901) and testing (MAE  X  0.624,
RMSE  X  0.842 and R 2  X  0.871) phases. Also, for the normalized length of fl ushing half-cone ( L/D ), ANN showed promising esti-mates with RMSE equal to 1.084 and 1.267 in training and testing phases, respectively. indicate that the ANN and ANFIS models outperform the existing studies. The Fathi-Moghadam et al. (2010) study appears to be slightly better in evaluating the volume of fl ushing half-cone than Meshkati et al. (2010) . However, the expression suggested by
Meshkati et al. (2010) (Eq. (1a) ) estimates the length of half-cone well as re fl ected by a high R 2 of 0.871 and low MAE and RMSE of 0.032 m and 0.042 m.

Fig. 7 compares the predicted fl ushing half-cone volume and length from the ANN model with those of Fathi-Moghadam et al. (2010) and Meshkati et al. (2010) . It is clear that the Fathi-
Moghadam et al. (2010) study overestimates the volume and length of fl ushing half-cone. Also, the approach proposed by
Meshkati et al. (2010) leads to the large scatter in the volume and length of fl ushing half-cone estimates. While, the proposed
ANN model gives improved predictions and thus is superior to available approaches. As shown in Fig. 7 , even the ANN model is unable to estimate the volume of fl ushing half-cone as accurately as its length. This can be attributed to the fact that some parameters such as consolidation and shape of the sediment, which affect the formation of fl ushing half-cone, have not been used in the ANN model.
 An alternative test was conducted to validate the proposed
ANN model. Unlike the previous examples, we use one set of data for training but use another independent dataset for testing. As pointed out by Kaya (2009 , 2010) , the predictions of ANN are valid within the trained and tested data. The data range of Fathi-
Moghadam et al. (2010) were far from those in Meshkati et al. (2010) and Emamgholizadeh (2005) , therefore, in this test, we model. As illustrated, the ANN model without H s has the highest
MAE and RMSE. In other words, the ability of ANN model to estimate the fl ushing half-cone geometry was signi fi degraded when the model was run without H s . This shows that
H has the most signi fi cant impact on the fl ushing half-cone geometry. Overall, the effect of input variables on fl ushing half-cone volume can be ranked from higher to lower as H s , d and H w . Thus, sediment properties (i.e., H s and d 50 ) have a more signi fi cant in fl uence on the fl ushing half-cone geometry than the fl uid characteristics (i.e., H w and u ). 6. Conclusions
In this study, the ANN and ANFIS models were proposed to estimate the fl ushing half-cone volume and length. We took advantage of a large number of experimental data with a wide range to train and test the models. Two combinations of input variables (i.e., original and non-dimensional) were employed to train and test the models. It was found that both models give better results when trained with original dataset. RMSEs for volume and length of fl ushing half-cone estimates from the ANN model when trained with original dataset were 0.005 m 3 and 0.014 m. Corresponding RMSEs when ANN was trained with the non-dimensional datasets were 0.842 and 1.267. Compared to
ANN, ANFIS provided less accurate estimates of fl ushing half-cone volume and length when trained with original dataset;
RMSEs of estimated V and L were respectively 0.008 m 3 and 0.021 m.

The estimations from ANN and ANFIS were also compared with those of existing studies. It was found that the ANN and ANFIS models predict the fl ushing half-cone volume and length more accurately than those studies. Finally, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the sediment characteristics, thickness of deposited sediment ( H s ) and mean grain diameter of deposited and mean fl ow velocity through bottom outlet ( u ), have respec-tively the most and the least effect on the fl ushing half-cone volume and length. This shows that the released sediments from reservoir via the pressure fl ushing technique is more dependent on the sediment attributes in contrast to the hydraulic character-istics such as water depth in reservoir ( H w ) and mean fl through bottom outlet ( u ). Even though the sediment thickness has a dominant effect on the shape of fl ushing half-cone, it should be taken into account that in practice we cannot wait for a thicker
