 Multi-label classification is prevalent in many real-world ap-plications, where each example can be associated with a set of multiple labels simultaneously. The key challenge of multi-label classification comes from the large space of all possible label sets, which is exponential to the number of candidate labels. Most previous work focuses on exploiting correlations among different labels to facilitate the learning process. It is usually assumed that the label correlations are given beforehand or can be derived directly from data samples by counting their label co-occurrences. However, in many real-world multi-label classification tasks, the la-bel correlations are not given and can be hard to learn di-rectly from data samples within a moderate-sized training set. Heterogeneous information networks can provide abun-dant knowledge about relationships among different types of entities including data samples and class labels. In this pa-per, we propose to use heterogeneous information networks to facilitate the multi-label classification process. By mining the linkage structure of heterogeneous information networks, multiple types of relationships among different class labels and data samples can be extracted. Then we can use these relationships to effectively infer the correlations among dif-ferent class labels in general, as well as the dependencies among the label sets of data examples inter-connected in the network. Empirical studies on real-world tasks demon-strate that the performance of multi-label classification can be effectively boosted using heterogeneous information net-works.
 H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Applications-Data Mining Algorithm, Experimentation, Performance Multi-label Classification, Heterogeneous Information Net-work, Label Correlation, Data Mining
Multi-label classification has become increasingly impor-tant in recent years, where each example can be associated with multiple labels simultaneously. It has a wide range of real-world applications. For example, in drug discovery, one molecular drug can bind with multiple protein targets, and researchers would like to predict which protein targets that one chemical compound can bind with in order to dis-cover new drugs for a certain disease; in gene-disease associ-ation prediction, one gene sequence can involve in multiple diseases, and researchers are interested in predicting which diseases that each gene is related to.

The key challenge of multi-label classification comes from the large space of all possible label sets, which is exponential to the number of candidate labels. To tackle this problem, conventional multi-label classification approaches [33, 11, 15] focus on exploiting the correlations among different class labels to facilitate the learning process. It is usually assumed that the label correlations are given beforehand or can be derived directly from data samples by counting their label co-occurrences.

However, in many real-world multi-label classification tasks, the label correlations are not given and can be hard to learn directly from data samples within a moderate-sized training set. Heterogeneous information networks [31] can usually provide abundant knowledge about the relationships among different types of entities including data samples and class labels. In this paper, we propose to use heterogeneous in-formation networks to facilitate the multi-label classification process. We first introduce an example of real-world multi-label classification task and show how a heterogeneous infor-mation network can facilitate the learning process of multi-label classification.
 Example (Drug-Target Binding Prediction): In drug dis-covery, one molecular drug can bind with a set of gene targets. The multi-label classification task here is to pre-dict which set of gene targets that one chemical compound can bind with in order to discover new drugs for a certain disease. The number of candidate labels are usually very large, involving hundreds or thousands of gene targets. The correlations among these gene targets are hard to learn di-rectly from data samples within a moderate-sized training set. However, if we already have a heterogeneous informa-Figure 1: An example of heterogeneous information network (the data schema of SLAP network). Each box represents one type of nodes in the network, and each dashed line represents one type of links. Each number under the node/link represents the to-tal number of nodes/links of the same type. tion network 1 as Figure 1 that contains abundant knowledge about the relationships among different types of entities in-cluding chemical compounds and gene targets , we can make use of the domain knowledge within this network to facilitate multi-label classification.

First, the heterogeneous information network can provide abundant knowledge about the relationships among differ-ent gene targets. In the network, gene targets are inter-connected with many other types of nodes, such as diseases and pathways. The gene targets, that are linked with similar diseases or pathways, are more likely to appear together in the same label set than those without such connections. Sec-ond, the heterogeneous information network can also provide abundant knowledge about the relationships among differ-ent chemical compounds. In the network, chemical com-pounds are also connected with other types of objects, such as side effects and chemical ontologies. The chemical com-pounds, that are linked with similar side effects or chemical ontologies, are more likely to have similar label sets than the chemicals without such connections.

By mining the linkage structure of heterogeneous informa-tion networks, multiple types of relationships among differ-ent class labels and data samples can be extracted. Such re-lationships can then be used to infer the correlations among different class labels in general, and the dependencies among the label sets of different data samples. In this paper, we fo-cus on studying the problem of multi-label classification by mining label and instance correlations from heterogeneous information networks. The major research challenges are as follows:
Mining heterogeneous label correlations : In multi-label classification, the multiple label concepts can be correlated with each other through multiple types of relationships. For example, different gene targets can be correlated for various
SLAP dataset [4]: this dataset is an information network that integrates many datasets into a single framework using Semantic Web technologies for drug discovery. It includes public datasets related to systems chemical biology: such as PubChem, DrugBank, PPI, SIDER, CTD diseases, KEGG Pathways, etc.
 Figure 2: Multi-label classification by mining het-erogeneous information networks. reasons: 1) they belong to the same gene family; 2) they share similar pathways; 3) they are inter-connected through PPI links, etc. Heterogeneous information networks can provide complex relationships among the label concepts, in-volving multiple types of label correlations [28]. How to exploit the linkage semantics is a very challenging problem [28], which has not yet been explored in this context.
Mining heterogeneous instance correlations : In multi-label classification, the label sets of different instances can also be correlated with each other through multiple types of rela-tionships. For example, different chemical compounds can be correlated for various reasons: 1) they have similar side effects; 2) they have similar chemical ontologies; 3) they have similar substructures, etc. Heterogeneous information networks can provide complex relationships among different instances, involving multiple types of correlations.
In this paper, we study how we can facilitate the multi-label classification process by mining the correlations among instances and labels from heterogeneous information net-works. We propose a novel solution, called PIPL , to assign a set of candidate labels to a group of related instances in heterogeneous information networks. Different from previ-ous work, the proposed PIPL , as shown in Figure 2, can ex-ploit various types of dependencies among both of instances and labels based upon different meta-paths in heterogeneous information networks. By explicitly exploiting these meta-path based dependencies, our PIPL method can effectively capture the diverse and complex relationships among in-stances and labels. Empirical studies on real-world tasks show that the proposed method can significantly boost the performance of multi-label classification by incorporating in-formation from heterogeneous information networks.
In this section, we first introduce some related concepts and notations, then define the problem.
Suppose we have a multi-label classification task with n instances and q labels. The set of all instances is denoted as V I = { I 1 ,  X  X  X  ,I n } , where each instance I i has a feature vector x i in the input space. The set of all candidate labels is denoted as V ` = { ` 1 ,  X  X  X  ,` q } . Without loss of generality, we assume the first n ` instances in V I , denoted as V { I 1 ,  X  X  X  ,I n ` }  X  V I , are labeled, where each instance I associated with a label set, denoted as Y i = Y 1 i ,  X  X  X  ,Y  X  X  0 , 1 } q . If instance I i has the j -th label ` j in its label set, Y i = 1 , otherwise Y are unlabeled, i.e. , V u I = V I  X  X  ` I . The task of multi-label classification is to predict the label sets for all the unlabeled instances in V u I . In other words, for any possible label set Y  X  { 0 , 1 } q and any instance I i , we need to build a model to estimate the probability P ( Y | x i ) based upon the training dataset.

The key challenge of multi-label classification comes from the fact that the output space of all possible label sets { 0 , 1 } is very large, which is exponential to the number of candi-date labels q . In order to tackle this problem, one simplest solution is to decompose the multi-label classification prob-lem into a set of binary classification problems (one for each label), e.g. , Bsvm [2]. This method can estimate P ( Y | x for instance I i approximately by assuming that all labels are independent: However, the correlations among different labels are totally ignored in these methods.

Most previous multi-label classification approaches focus on exploiting the label correlations to facilitate the learning process. For example, the Ecc method [27] captures label correlations directly from data samples by approximate the probability P ( Y | x i ) as follows:
P ( Y | x i )  X  P ( Y 1 | x i ) P ( Y 2 | Y 1 i , x i ) P ( Y It is usually assumed implicitly that the label correlations can be derived directly from the observed data samples by counting their label co-occurrences.

However, in many real-world multi-label classification tasks, the label correlations are hard to learn directly from data samples with a moderate-sized training set. Heterogeneous information networks [31] can usually provide abundant knowl-edge about the relationships among different types of enti-ties including data samples and class labels. In this paper, we propose to use heterogeneous information networks to facilitate the multi-label classification process.
A heterogeneous information network is a special kind of information network with multiple types of nodes and mul-tiple types of links [31, 28]. It can be represented as a di-rected graph G = ( V , E ). V denotes the set of nodes, which involves t types of objects: V 1 = { v 11 ,  X  X  X  ,v 1 n 1 } ,  X  X  X  , V { v t 1 ,  X  X  X  ,v tn t } , where v ij represents the j -th object of type i . E  X  V  X V denotes the links between the objects in V , which includes multiple types of links.

First we define the type of nodes in the heterogeneous information network G corresponds to the instances of the multi-label classification task as the instance type . While we define type of nodes corresponds to the label concepts for the multi-label classification task as the label type . For example, in the task of drug-target binding prediction, the chemical compound nodes are the instances and the gene nodes are the labels; in the task of gene-disease association prediction, the gene nodes are the instances and the disease nodes are the labels.
Heterogeneous information networks can provide abun-dant knowledge about the relationships among different types of entities including data samples and class labels. By min-ing the linkage structure of heterogeneous information net-works, multiple types of relationships among different class labels and the data samples can be extracted. Such relation-ships can be used to infer the correlations among different class labels in general, and the dependencies among the label sets of different data samples.

In the following subsections, we first discuss how to ex-tract heterogeneous relationships among different labels from heterogeneous information networks in section 3.2. We then discuss how to extract heterogeneous relationships among the instance from heterogeneous information networks in section 3.3. We then integrate these two parts into a unified model in section 3.4.
Before discussing in detail about the proposed method, we first introduce the concept of meta-path in heterogeneous in-formation networks. Following the works [28, 20, 18, 30], we first briefly review the concept of meta-path. Then we use meta-paths to describe the possible relationships among in-stances and labels derived from a heterogeneous information network.

Generally, meta-path is defined as a sequence of relations in the network schema. The objects in heterogeneous in-formation networks (including the instances and labels) are inter-connected through multiple types of links. Each type of links from node type i to node type j corresponds to a binary relation R , where R ( v ip ,v jq ) holds if object v v jq are linked by a link of type R . For example, in Fig-ure 1, the link type  X  X asPathway X  is a relation between gene nodes and pathways nodes, where R ( v ip ,v jq ) holds if the gene node v ip has a link of type  X  X asPathway X  to the path-way node v jq in the network. We can write the link type as  X  X ene hasP athway  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  pathway X  or  X  V i R  X  X  X V j  X .
A meta-path P corresponds a type of path within the net-work graph, containing a certain sequence of link types. For example, in Figure 1, a meta-path  X  X ene hasP athway  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  path-way hasP athway  X  1  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  gene X  denotes the composite relation-ship between gene nodes where the semantic meaning of this meta-path is that the two gene nodes share a common pathway node. The link type  X  X asPathway  X  1  X  represents the inverted relation of  X  X asPathway X .

Different meta-paths usually represent different relation-ships among the linked objects with totally different seman-tic meanings. For example, the meta-path  X  X ene P P I  X  X  X  X  X  X  gene X  denotes the two gene nodes are connected through  X  X PI X  links; while meta-path  X  X ene hasGO  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  GO hasGO  X  1  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  gene X  cor-responds to the semantic meaning that the two gene nodes share common gene ontology terms.
Heterogeneous information networks can involve various existing knowledge about the candidate label concepts, where the complex correlations among label concepts are embed-ded within the network structures. For example, in Figure 1, the label nodes ( i.e. , the gene nodes) are linked with each other directly through  X  X PI X  links.

It indicates one type of label correlation within the net-work structure: gene labels that are linked by  X  X PI X  links can be more likely (or less likely) to appear together in the label set of a chemical compound than those without  X  X PI X  links.

To generalize, the label concepts can also be linked by certain meta-paths, thus being correlated. For example, the gene labels are also linked with each other through the meta-type of label correlations: gene labels that share similar gene ontology terms can be more likely (or less likely) to appear together in the label set of a chemical compound than those without such meta-path links. Thus meta-paths among the label nodes, i.e. , the meta-path starting and ending with the label node type, can effectively capture different types of label correlations embedded in heterogeneous information networks.

We propose to exploit meta-path-based label correlations for multi-label classification. Given a set of meta-paths among the label nodes, S ` = {P 1 ,  X  X  X  , P c ` } , the meta-path-based label correlations can be used as follows: where P j ( k ) denotes the index set of labels that are linked to the k -th label through meta-path P j  X  X  ` .
Existing approaches for multi-label classification usually have i.i.d. assumptions, where the label set predictions on different instances are assumed to be independent: However, in heterogeneous information networks, there are complex correlations not only among different labels but also among different instances. Heterogeneous information networks can involve various existing knowledge about the instances, where the complex correlations among the label sets of different instances are embedded within the network structures.

Similar to the previous subsection, the instance nodes can also be linked by certain meta-paths, thus the label sets of the linked instances can be correlated. For example, the chemical compound nodes are linked with each other through the meta-path  X  X hemical compound causeSideEffect  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  Side Ef-the type of instance correlations: chemical drugs that share similar side effects can be more likely (or less likely) to have similar label sets than those without such meta-path links. Thus meta-paths among the instance nodes, i.e. , the meta-path starting and ending with the instance node type, can effectively capture different types of instance correlations embedded in heterogeneous information networks.

We propose to exploit meta-path-based instance correla-tions for multi-label classification. Given a set of meta-paths among the instance nodes, S I = {P 0 1 ,  X  X  X  , P 0 c I } , the meta-path-based instance correlations can be used as follows: where P 0 j ( i ) denotes the index set of instances that are linked to the i -th instance through meta-path P 0 j  X  X  I .
In order to perform multi-label collective classification more effectively in heterogeneous information networks, in this paper, we explicitly consider both meta-path-based la-Figure 4: The functions of constructing relational features for meta-path-based label correlations and meta-path-based instance correlations bel correlations and meta-path-based intance correlations si-multaneously.

In Figure 3, we summarize the proposed multi-label col-lective classification algorithm, called PIPL . The algorithm includes the following steps: Meta-path Construction : Given a heterogeneous infor-mation network, we first extract all non-redundant meta-paths for label correlations and instance correlations sepa-rately. A meta-path P j in S ` (or P 0 j in S I ) is non-redundant if P j (or P 0 j ) cannot be reconstructed by combining any sub-set of the meta-paths in S ` (or S I ). We only extract short meta-paths with a maximum path length p max. It has been shown in [28] that long meta-paths are not quite useful in capturing the linkage structure of heterogeneous information networks.
 Training Initialization : We construct q extended train-ing sets  X  1  X  k  X  q, D k = ( x k i ,y k i ) by converting each instance x i to x k i using the functions in Figure 4. We train one classifier on each label, using the extended training sets. Iterative Inference : Overall, it is an iterative classification algorithm [22] for the inference step. During the inference, we iteratively update the label set predictions of the testing instances, and the relational features corresponding to the label and instance correlations.
In order to evaluate the performances of multi-label collec-tive classification in heterogeneous information networks, we had our algorithm tested on a bioinformatic dataset SLAP [4], which is a heterogeneous network composed by over 290 K nodes and 720 K edges. As shown in Figure 1, the SLAP dataset contains integrated data related to chemi-cal compounds, genes, diseases, side effects, pathways etc. Specifically, there are two different prediction tasks studied in this section:  X  Gene-Disease Association Prediction : The first task we studied is gene-disease association prediction, where we treat genes as the instances, and diseases as the labels. In SLAP dataset, each gene can cause or be related to multiple dis-eases simultaneously. The label set of each gene is defined as the set of diseases that the gene can cause. The task of gene-disease association prediction is that, we are given a set of training gene instances, and for each unlabeled gene in-stance, we want to predict which set of diseases the gene can cause. In this way, we could discover what kinds of diseases might be caused by a specific gene. In details, we extracted 3000 gene ontology terms (GO terms) and used them as the features of each gene instance. The top-50 diseases that are associated with the largest number of genes were used as the candidate labels. The labels of this task is highly in-complete. Thus, we kept all the genes which had at least one label, and randomly sampled additional gene instances without any direct link connection to any disease, according to 1 : 10 ratio. The final dataset contains 1943 instances, 3000 features and 50 labels in total. All the remaining nodes are kept in the network, and can be used in meta-paths.  X  Drug-Target Binding Prediction : The second task we stud-ied is drug-target binding prediction, where we treat chem-ical compounds as the instances and genes as the labels. We first represent the structure of each chemical compound as a graph object. Then we used the multi-label subgraph mining algorithm [19] to extract 1500 subgraphs from the dataset and used them as features of the instances. Simi-lar to the previous task, the top-50 genes that are binded with the largest number of chemical compounds were used as the candidate labels. We removed the instances with no feature. The dataset contains 5651 instances, 1500 features and 50 labels in total. All the remaining nodes are kept in the network, and can be used in meta-paths.
Multi-label classification problems require more compli-cated criteria for performance evaluation than conventional single-label classification problems. We use some evaluation criteria in [10, 14, 21, 37, 8] to verify the multi-label classifi-cation performance in heterogeneous information networks. Given a multi-label dataset D U involving n instances, i.e. , ( x i , Y i ). Here Y i  X  { 0 , 1 } q ( i = 1 ,  X  X  X  ,n ). Denote h ( x the predicted label set for x i by a multi-label classifier h . We have the following evaluation criteria:  X  Micro F1 [10, 14, 21]: is the harmonic mean of micro average of Precision and Recall. The micro average means that the score is first computed on each label separately and then averaged with equal importance. The larger the value, the better the performance.  X  Hamming loss [8, 37]: evaluates the symetric difference between true labels and predicted labels.
 where  X  stands for the symmetric difference of two sets. k X k denotes the l 1 -norm. The smaller the value, the better the performance.  X  Subset 0/1 Loss [8, 10]: evaluates 0/1 loss over the label set prediction.
 I (  X  ) denotes the indicator function, i.e. , I (  X  ) = 1 iff  X  holds, Method Type of Classification Type of Correlations Exploited Publication Bsvm Binary Classification all independent [2] Table 2: Classification performances  X  X verage score  X  std (rank)  X  on gene-disease association prediction task. the performance. otherwise I (  X  ) = 0. The smaller the value, the better the performance.
In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-label classification approach, we compared the following methods (summarized in Table 1): Table 3: Classification performances  X  X verage score  X  std (rank)  X  on drug-target binding prediction task.  X   X   X  performance.
For a fair comparison, we use LibSVM [3] with linear ker-nel and default parameter as the base classifier for all the compared methods. The maximum number of iterations in the methods PIPL , PIml and PIsl are all set as 10.
We first study the effectiveness of the proposed PIPL method on multi-label collective classification in heteroge-neous information networks. In our experiments, 5-fold cross validations are performed on each task to evaluate the per-formances of multi-label collective classification. We show the detailed results in Table 2 and Table 3, with the number of candidate labels varying from 10 to 50. The average per-formances of the five methods with standard deviations are reported with respect to three different evaluation metrics.
In both tasks, we can observe that the Bsvm method, which assumes all instances and labels are independent, is outperformed by other methods, which explicitly consider correlations among predictions from various aspects. These results demonstrate the importance of exploiting different types of correlations for multi-label collective classification in heterogeneous information networks. In details, PIsl can improve performances over Bsvm because it exploits the meta-path based instance correlation. These results support our first assumption that in multi-label heterogenous infor-mation networks, the label sets of related instances through instance meta-pahts are not independent, and should be classified collectively. Similar conclusions can also be drawn from the results that PIml outperforms Ecc . Though both methods can exploit simple label correlation, PIml can fur-ther exploit the meta-path based instance correlations, while Ecc assumes that the label sets of different instances are independent, and are predicted independently. Thus it is necessary and important to exploit the meta-path based cor-relations among the related instances.

We also observe that in gene-disease association predic-tion task, meta-path based methods designed for hetero-geous networks ( i.e. , PIsl , PIml , PIPL ) can achieve better performances than the Icml that only exploits the homoge-neous network among instances.

We further observe that the proposed PIPL performs the best among all compared methods. Especially, PIPL out-performs PIml and PIsl , by taking meta-path based label correlation into consideration. In heterogeneous informa-tion networks, both of instances and candidate labels can be correlated with each other via diverse semantic mean-ings. In Table 4, we show four examples of the meta paths used by PIPL method in both tasks, which correspond to label correlations and instance correlations separately. Such complex correlations can be effectively exploited through in-stance and label meta-paths and thus boost the classifica-tion performances of multi-label collective classification in heterogeneous information networks.
In previous subsection, we extracted 3000 GO terms and used them as features for Gene-Disease association predic-tion task. For Drug-Target binding prediction task, we ex-tracted 1500 substructures of the chemical compounds and used them as features. To test the stability of the per-formances of PIPL method, we show the micro-F1 scores of each method under different numbers of features (rang-ing from 500 to 5000 in Gene-Disease association prediction task, and from 400 to 2400 in Drug-Target binding predic-tion task) with 50 candidate labels. Figure 5(a) and Fig-ure 5(b) illustrate that PIPL performs quite well and stably, and it is not sensitive to the number of features.
Multi-label classification has been extensively studied in recent years [33, 11, 15, 32, 5, 25, 12]. Conventional meth-ods can be roughly categorized as follows: (1) binary ap-proaches, which converts the multi-label problem into multi-ple independent binary classification problems (one for each label) [2, 36] (2) pairwise approaches which exploit the pair-wise relation between different labels [10, 9]. (3) High-order approaches: The third type of approaches considers (b) Drug-Target Binding Prediction dataset publication network classification (node,link) #Nodes Node Types Gene [34] homogeneous single-label (1,1) 1,243 gene Citeseer [22] homogeneous single-label (1,1) 3,312 paper WebKB [7] homogeneous single-label (1,1) 3,877 webpage DBLP [17] homogeneous multi-label (1,1) 4638 author the high-order correlations among different labels. Such ap-proaches includes random subset ensemble approaches [26, 27], Bayesian network based approach [35] and full-order ap-proaches [6, 8]. [17] studied the multi-label collective classi-fication using homogeneous networks.

Heterogeneous information networks have attracted much attention in recent years [31, 29, 13]. Sun et al. [31, 28] studied the clustering problem and top-k similarity problem in heterogeneous information networks. Ji et al. studied a specialized classification problem on heterogeneous net-works, where different types of nodes share a same set of label concepts [13]. [18, 16] studied collective classification problem in heterogeneous information networks .

In Table 5 we reviewed the datasets used in previous works on network classification. It shows that among all datasets, SLAP dataset is one of the best choices for studying multi-label classification in heterogeneous information networks.
In this paper, we studied how to exploit heterogeneous information networks for multi-label collective classification. Conventional multi-label learning approaches usually assume that the label correlations are either given or can be derived directly from data samples by counting their co-occurrences. We proposed to use heterogeneous information networks to facilitate the learning process of multi-label classification by mining label correlations and instance correlations from the network. We propose a novel solution to multi-label clas-sification, called PIPL by exploiting complex linkage infor-mation in heterogeneous information networks. Empirical studies on real-world tasks demonstrate that the proposed multi-label classification approach can effectively boost clas-sification performances.
