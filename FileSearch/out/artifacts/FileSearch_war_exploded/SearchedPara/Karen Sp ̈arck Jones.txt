 The Athena Lecturer Award, given by the ACM Committee on Women in Computing (ACM-W), recognizes women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to Computer Science. The first Athena Award was made in 2006, to Deborah Estrin.
The SIGIR Executive Committee decided in November 2006 to nominate Karen for the 2007 Athena Award. That nomination was successful, and the good news was communicated to Karen in February 2007, just weeks before her death. The next section is an edited version of the Athena Award nomination text that was prepared in consultation with Karen.
 Professor Karen Sp  X arck Jones has had a distinguished research ca-reer in the areas of Information Retrieval, Natural Language Pro-cessing, and Computational Linguistics. She was a pioneer in these fields, and her contributions have spanned nearly fifty years, through to and including recent seminal papers. For example, her co-author-ship of a pair of 2000-published papers in Information Process-ing and Management represents the culmination of a line of re-search that resulted in new  X  and highly effective  X  term weight-ing schemes for web search systems. An earlier paper in the same thread,  X  Relevance weighting of search terms  X , 1976, has garnered more than 600 citations (note that much of Karen X  X  early work is not captured by automatic citation systems). Karen has more than 200 publications, including 9 books.

The impact of her work has been truly enormous. An integral part of every web search engine is a computation called tf The tf part of that computation was originally contributed by the late Gerard Salton, and the idf part was the work of Karen. Work-ing with Steve Robertson in the early 1990s, Karen also took part in the development of the term weighting formula subsequently known as BM25. This started from the relevance weighting work of 1976, and incorporated more sophisticated forms of tf and docu-ment length normalization. That formulation was key to the success of the original AltaVista search engine, which ushered in the era of large-scale web search services.

Further evidence of Karen X  X  impact and influence is John Tait X  X  2005 book,  X  Charting a New Course: Natural Language Process-ing and Information Retrieval: Essays in Honour of Karen Sp  X arck Jones  X . The Athena Award Committee will be aware of how few scientists are honored by their colleagues in this way.
Karen has given more than two dozen major invited talks in the last twenty years; has served on numerous program committees and editorial boards; and has acted in many professional and ser-vice roles, for instance as President of the Association for Com-putational Linguistics in 1994. She has enjoyed almost continuous grant funding since the mid-1960s, and has supervised 17 doctoral students in her career at Cambridge, helping to establish the strong reputation of her Cambridge group.

Karen is a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial In-telligence (1993) and a Fellow of the British Academy (1995); was the 1988 recipient of the SIGIR Award for Research Achievement (now named the Salton Award); was given its Award of Merit in 2002 by the American Society for Information Science and Tech-nology; and in 2004 was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Association for Computational Linguistics. She spoke at the first Grace Hopper Conference in Washington in 1994 and gave the Grace Hopper Lecture at the University of Pennsylvania in 2002. Karen has also has consistently supported computing for women in Cambridge initiatives, and sought to encourage women already in computing.

To summarize  X  Professor Karen Sp  X arck Jones has been an em-inent scholar in the richest possible sense, and with her attention to detail, her broad knowledge, and her willingness to both enquire and critique, has served as a role model for two complete genera-tions of researchers.
 Karen was aware of the severity of her illness. Within days of being informed of the Athena Award outcome and of the award of the BCS Lovelace Medal (she received both notifications on the same day in late February), Karen set about creating a video record of her acceptance presentation. Karen passed away on 4 April 2007, and was unable to realize her goal of attending SIGIR 2007 and accepting the Athena Lecturer Award in person. Please join with us as we remember the rich life and many contributions of Karen Sp  X arck Jones  X  scholar, academic, and friend.
