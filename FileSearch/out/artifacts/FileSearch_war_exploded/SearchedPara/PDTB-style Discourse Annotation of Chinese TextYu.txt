 In the realm of discourse annotation, the Penn Dis-course TreeBank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) sep-arates itself by adopting a lexically grounded ap-proach: Discourse relations are lexically anchored by discourse connectives (e.g., because, but, there-fore ), which are viewed as predicates that take ab-stract objects such as propositions, events and states as their arguments. In the absence of explicit dis-course connectives, the PDTB asks the annotator to fill in a discourse connective that best describes the discourse relation between these two sentences, in-stead of selecting from an inventory of predefined discourse relations. By keeping the discourse an-notation lexically grounded even in the case of im-plicit discourse relations, the PDTB appeals to the annotator X  X  judgment at an intuitive level. This is in contrast with an approach in which the set of dis-course relations are pre-determined by linguistic ex-perts and the role of the annotator is just to select from those choices (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Carlson et al., 2003). This lexically grounded ap-proach led to consistent and reliable discourse anno-tation, a feat that is generally hard to achieve for dis-course annotation. The PDTB team reported inter-annotator agreement in the lower 90% for explicit discourse relations (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).
In this paper we describe a discourse annota-tion scheme for Chinese that adopts this lexically grounded approach while making adaptations when warranted by the linguistic and statistical properties of Chinese text. This scheme is shown to be practi-cal and effective in the annotation experiment. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review the key aspects of the PDTB annotation scheme under discussion in this paper. In Section 3, we first show that some key features of Chinese make adaptations necessary in Section 3.1, and then in Section 3.2, we present our systematic adaptations that follow from the differences outlined in Section 3.1. In Section 4, we present the prelim-inary annotation results we have so far. And finally in Section 5, we conclude the paper. As mentioned in the introduction, discourse relation is viewed as a predication with two arguments in the framework of the PDTB. To characterize the pred-ication, the PDTB annotates its argument structure and sense. Two types of discourse relation are dis-tinguished in the annotation: explicit and implicit. Although their annotation is carried out separately, it conforms to the same paradigm of a discourse con-nective with two arguments. In what follows, we highlight the key points that will be under discussion in the following sections. To get a more compre-hensive and detailed picture of the PDTB scheme, see the PDTB 2.0 annotation manual (Prasad et al., 2007). 2.1 Annotation of explicit discourse relations Explicit discourse relations are those anchored by explicit discourse connectives in text. Explicit con-nectives are drawn from three grammatical classes:  X  Subordinating conjunctions : e.g., because,  X  Coordinating conjunctions : e.g., and, or, nor ;  X  Discourse adverbials : e.g., however, other-Not all uses of these lexical items are considered to function as a discourse connective. For example, coordinating conjunctions appearing in VP coordi-nations, such as  X  and  X  in (1), are not annotated as discourse connectives. (1) More common chrysotile fibers are curly and
The text spans of the two arguments of a discourse connective are marked up. The two arguments, Arg1 and Arg2 , are defined based on the physical location of the connective: Arg2 is the argument expressed by the clause syntactically bound to the connective, and Arg1 is the other argument. There are no restric-tions on how many clauses can be included in the text span for an argument other than the Minimality Principle : Only as many clauses and/or sentences should be included in an argument selection as are minimally required and sufficient for the interpreta-tion of the relation. 2.2 Annotation of implicit discourse relations In the case of implicit discourse relations, annotators are asked to insert a discourse connective that best conveys the implicit relation; when no such connec-tive expression is appropriate, the implicit relation is further distinguished as the following three sub-types:  X  AltLex : when insertion of a connective leads  X  EntRel : when the only relation between the  X  NoRel : when neither a lexicalized discourse re-(2) And she further stunned her listeners by re-(3) [ Arg 1 Hale Milgrim, 41 years old, senior vice

There are three levels in the sense hierarchy:  X  Class : There are four major semantic classes:  X  Type : A second level of types is further de- X  Subtype : A third level of subtypes is defined It is worth noting that a type of implicit relation, namely those labeled as  X  X ntRel X , is not part of the sense hierarchy since it has no explicit counterpart. 3.1 Key characteristics of Chinese text Despite similarities in discourse features between Chinese and English (Xue, 2005), there are differ-ences that have a significant impact on how dis-course relations could be best annotated. These dif-ferences can be illustrated with (5): (5)  X   X  This sentence reports on how a pilot program worked in Dongguan City. Because all that is said is about the pilot program, it is perfectly natural to include it all in a single sentence in Chinese. Intu-itively though, there are two different aspects of how the pilot program worked: the number of records and the response from the affected companies. To report the same facts in English, it is more natural to break them down into two sentences or two semi-colon-separated clauses, but in Chinese, not only are they merely separated by comma, but also there is no connective relating them .

This difference in writing style necessitates re-thinking of the annotation scheme. If we apply the PDTB scheme to the English translation, regardless of whether the two pieces of facts are expressed in two sentences or two semi-colon-separated clauses, at least one discourse relation will be annotated, re-lating these two text units. In contrast, if we apply the same scheme to the Chinese sentence, no dis-course relation will be picked out because this is just one comma-separated sentence with no explicit discourse connectives in it. In other words, the dis-course relation within the Chinese sentence, which would be captured in its English counterpart follow-ing the PDTB procedure, would be lost when anno-tating Chinese. Such loss is not a sporadic occur-rence but rather a very prevalent one since it is asso-ciated with the customary writing style of Chinese. To ensure a reasonable level of coverage, we need to consider comma-delimited intra-sentential implicit relations when annotating Chinese text.

There are some complications associated with this move. One of them is that it introduces into dis-course annotation considerable ambiguity associ-ated with the comma. For example, the first in-stance of comma in (5), immediately following  X   X   X   X  ( X  X ccording to reports X ), clearly does not indi-cate a discourse relation, so it needs to be spelt out in the guidelines how to exclude such cases of comma as discourse relation indicators. We think, however, that disambiguating the commas in Chinese text is valuable in its own right and is a necessary step in annotating discourse relations.

Another complication is that some comma-separated chunks are ambiguous as to whether they should be considered potential arguments in a dis-course relation. The chunks marked AO 2 and AO 4 in (5) are examples of such cases. They, judging from their English translation, may seem clear cases of free adjuncts in PDTB terms (Prasad et al., 2007), but there is no justification for treating them as such in Chinese. The lack of justification comes from at least three features of Chinese:  X  Certain words, for instance,  X   X   X   X  ( X  X e- X  There are no inflectional clues to differenti- X  Both subject and object can be dropped in Chi-Since in Chinese, there is no reliable indicator dis-tinguishing between main clauses and free adjuncts, or distinguishing between coordination on the clause level without the subject and coordination on the VP level, we will not rely on these distinctions in anno-tation , as the PDTB team does in their annotation.
These basic decisions directly based on linguistic characteristics of Chinese lead to more systematic adaptations to the annotation scheme, to which we will turn in the next subsection. 3.2 Systematic adaptations The main consequence of the basic decisions de-scribed in Section 3.1 is that we have a whole lot more tokens of implicit relation than explicit rela-tion to deal with. According to a rough count on 20 randomly selected files from Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005), 82% are tokens of implicit rela-tion, compared to 54.5% in the PDTB 2.0. Given the overwhelming number of implicit relations, we re-examine where it could make an impact in the an-notation scheme. There are three such areas. 3.2.1 Procedural division between explicit and
In the PDTB, explicit and implicit relations are annotated separately. This is probably partly be-cause explicit connectives are quite abundant in En-glish, and partly because the project evolved in stages, expanding from the more canonical case of explicit relation to implicit relation for greater cov-erage. When annotating Chinese text, maintaining this procedural division makes much less sense: the landscape of discourse relation (or at least the key elements of it) has already been mapped out by the PDTB work and to set up a separate task to cover 18% of the data does not seem like a worthwhile bother without additional benefits for doing so.
So the question now is how to annotate explicit and implicit relations in one fell swoop? In Chi-nese text, the use of a discourse connective is al-most always accompanied by a punctuation or two (usually period and/or comma), preceding or flank-ing it. So a sensible solution is to rely on punctu-ations as the denominator between explicit and im-plicit relations;and in the case of explicit relation, the connective will be marked up as an attribute of the discourse relation. This unified approach simpli-fies the annotation procedure while preserving the explicit/implicit distinction in the process.
One might question, at this point, whether such an approach can still call itself  X  X exically grounded X . Certainly not if one interprets the term literally ; but in a broader sense, our approach can be seen as an instantiation of a generalized version of it, much the same way that the PDTB is an, albeit different, in-stantiation of it for English. The thrust of the lexi-cally grounded approach is that discourse annotation should be a data-driven, bottom-up process, rather than a top-down one, trying to fit data into a pre-scriptive system. Once the insight that a discourse connective functions like a predicate with two ar-guments is generalized to cover all discourse rela-tions, there is no fundamental difference between explicit and implicit discourse relations: both work like a predicate whether or not there is a lexicaliza-tion of it. As to what role this distinction plays in the annotation procedure, it is an engineering issue, depending on a slew of factors, among which are cross-linguistic variations. In the case of Chinese, we think it is more economical to treat explicit and implicit relations alike in the annotation process.
To treat explicit and implicit relations alike actu-ally goes beyond annotating them in one pass; it also involves how they are annotated, which we discuss next. 3.2.2 Annotation of implicit discourse relations
In the PDTB, treatment of implicit discourse rela-tions is modeled after that of explicit relations, and at the same time, some restrictions are put on implicit, but not explicit, relations. This is quite understand-able: implicit discourse relations tend to be vague and elusive, so making use of explicit relations as a prototype helps pin them down, and restrictions are put in place to strike a balance between high relia-bility and good coverage. When implicit relations constitute a vast majority of the data as is the case with Chinese, both aspects need to be re-examined to strike a new balance.

In the PDTB, annotators are asked to insert a discourse connective that best conveys the implicit discourse relation between two adjacent discourse units; when no such connective expression is ap-propriate, the implicit discourse relation is further distinguished as  X  X ltLex X ,  X  X ntRel X , and  X  X oRel X . The inserted connectives and those marked as  X  X l-tLex X , along with explicit discourse connectives, are further annotated with respect to their senses.
When a connective needs to be inserted in a ma-jority of cases, the difficulty of the task really stands out. In many cases, it seems, there is a good rea-son for not having a connective present and because of it, the wording rejects insertion of a connective even if it expresses the underlying discourse relation exactly (or sometimes, maybe the wording itself is the reason for not having a connective). So to try to insert a connective expression may very well be too hard a task for annotators, with little to show for their effort in the end.
Furthermore, the inter-annotator agreement for providing an explicit connective in place of an im-plicit one is computed based on the type of explicit connectives (e.g. cause-effect relations, temporal re-lations, contrastive relations, etc.), rather than based on their identity (Miltsakaki et al., 2004). This sug-gests that a reasonable degree of agreement for such a task may only be reached with a coarse classifica-tion scheme.

Given the above two considerations, our solution is to annotate implicit discourse relations with their senses directly, bypassing the step of inserting a con-nective expression. It has been pointed out that to train annotators to reason about pre-defined abstract relations with high reliability might be too hard a task (Prasad et al., 2007). This difficulty can be overcome by associating each semantic type with one or two prototypical explicit connectives and ask-ing annotators to consider each to see if it expresses the implicit discourse relation. This way, annotators have a concrete aid to reason about abstract relations without having to choose one connective from a set expressing roughly the same relation or having to worry about whether insertion of the connective is somehow awkward.

It should be noted that annotating implicit rela-tions directly with their senses means that sense an-notation is no longer restricted to those that can be lexically expressed, but also includes those that can-not, notably those labeled  X  X ntRel/NoRel X  in the PDTB. 2 In other words, we annotate senses of dis-course relations , not just connectives and their lex-ical alternatives (in the case of AltLex). This ex-pansion is consistent with the generalized view of the lexically grounded approach discussed in Sec-tion 3.2.1.

With respect to restrictions on implicit relation, we will adopt them as they prove to be necessary in the annotation process, with one exception. The exception is the restriction that implicit relations be-tween adjacent clauses in the same sentence not sep-arated by a semi-colon are not annotated. This re-striction seems to apply mainly to a main clause and any free adjunct attached to it in English; in Chinese, however, the distinction between a main clause and a free adjunct is not as clear-cut for reasons explained in Section 3.1. So this restriction is not applicable for Chinese annotation. 3.2.3 Definition of Arg1 and Arg2
The third area that an overwhelming number of implicit relation in the data affects is how Arg1 and Arg2 are defined. As mentioned in the introduc-tion, discourse relations are viewed as a predication with two arguments. These two arguments are de-fined based on the physical location of the connec-tive in the PDTB: Arg2 is the argument expressed by the clause syntactically bound to the connective and Arg1 is the other argument. In the case of implicit relations, the label is assigned according to the text order.

In an annotation task where implicit relations con-stitute an overwhelming majority, the distinction of Arg1 and Arg2 is meaningless in most cases. In addi-tion, the phenomenon of parallel connectives is pre-dominant in Chinese. Parallel connectives are pairs of connectives that take the same arguments, exam-ples of which in English are  X  if..then  X ,  X  either..or  X , and  X  on the one hand..on the other hand  X . In Chi-nese, most connectives are part of a pair; though some can be dropped from their pair, it is considered  X  X roper X  or formal to use both. (8) below presents two such examples, for which parallel connectives are not possible in English. In the PDTB, parallel connectives are annotated dis-continuously; but given the prevalence of such phe-nomenon in Chinese, such practice would generate a considerably high percentage of essentially repeti-tive annotation among explicit relations.

So the situation with Chinese is that distinguish-ing Arg1 and Arg2 the PDTB way is meaningless in most cases, and in the remaining cases, it of-ten results in duplication. Rather than abandoning the distinction altogether, we think it makes more sense to define Arg1 and Arg2 semantically. It will not create too much additional work beyond distinc-tion of different senses of discourse relation in the PDTB. For example, in the semantic type CONTIN -GENCY : C ause, we can define  X  X eason X  as Arg1 and  X  X esult X  as Arg2 . In this scheme, no matter which one of  X  ( X  X ecause X ) and  X  ( X  X herefore X ) appears without the other, or if they appear as a pair in a sentence, or if the relation is implicit, the Arg1 and Arg2 labels will be consistently assigned to the same clauses.

This approach is consistent with the move from annotating senses of connectives to annotating senses of discourse relations , pointed out in Section 3.2.2. For example, in the PDTB X  X  sense hierarchy,  X  X eason X  and  X  X esult X  are subtypes under type CON -TINGENCY : C ause:  X  X eason X  applies to connectives like  X  because  X  and  X  since  X  while  X  X esult X  applies to connectives like  X  so  X  and  X  as a result  X . When we move to annotating senses of discourse relations, since both types of connectives express the same un-derlying discourse relation, there will not be further division under CONTINGENCY : C ause, and the  X  X ea-son X / X  X esult X  distinction is an intrinsic property of the semantic type. We think this level of generality makes sense semantically. To test our adapted annotation scheme, we have con-ducted annotation experiments on a modest, yet sig-nificant, amount of data and computed agreement statistics. 4.1 Set-up The agreement statistics come from annotation con-ducted by two annotators in training so far. The data set consists of 98 files taken from the Chinese Tree-bank (Xue et al., 2005). The source of these files is Xinhua newswire. The annotation is carried out on the PDTB annotation tool 3 . 4.2 Inter-annotator agreement To evaluate our proposed scheme, we measure agreement on each adaption proposed in Section 3, as well as agreement on argument span deter-mination. Whenever applicable, we also present (roughly) comparable statistics of the PDTB (Milt-sakaki et al., 2004). The results are summarized in Table 1.
 rel-ident 3951* rel-type 3951 95.1 N/A imp-sns-type 2967 87.4 72 arg-order 3059 99.8 N/A argument span exp-span-xm 1580 84.2 90.2 exp-span-pm 1580 99.6 94.5 imp-span-xm 5934 76.9 85.1 overall-bnd-14039*
The first adaption we proposed is to annotate ex-plicit and implicit discourse relations in one pass. This introduces two steps, at which agreement can each be measured: First, the annotator needs to make the judgment, at each instance of the punctu-ations, whether there is a discourse relation (a step we call  X  X elation identification X ); second, once a dis-course relation is identified, the annotator needs to classify the type as one of  X  X xplicit X ,  X  X mplicit X , or  X  X ltLex X  (a step we call  X  X elation type classifica-tion X ). The agreement at these two steps is 95.4% and 95.1% respectively.

The second adaption is to bypass the step of in-serting a connective when annotating an implicit dis-course relation and classify the sense directly. The third adaptation is to define Arg1 and Arg2 semanti-cally for each sense. To help annotators think about relation sense abstractly and determine the order of the arguments, we put a helper item alongside each sense label, like  X  X ausation:  X   X  arg1  X   X  arg2 X  ( X  X ausation: because arg1 therefore arg2 X ). This approach works well, as evidenced by 87.4% 4 and 99.8% agreement for the two processes respectively.
To evaluate agreement on determining argument span, we adopt four measures. In the first three, explicit and implicit relations are calculated sepa-rately (although they are actually annotated in the same process) to make our results comparable to the published PDTB results. Each argument span is treated as an independent token and either exact or partial match (i.e. if two spans share one boundary) counts as 1. The fourth measure is less stringent than exact match and more stringent than partial match: It groups explicit and implicit relation together and treats each boundary as an independent token. Typ-ically, an argument span has two boundaries, but it can have four (or more) boundaries when an argu-ment span is interrupted by a connective and/or an AltLex item.

Evidently, determining argument span is the most challenging aspect of discourse annotation. How-ever, it should be pointed out that agreement was on an overall upward trend, which became especially prominent after we instituted a restriction on im-plicit relations across a paragraph boundary towards the end of the training period. It restricts full anno-tation to only three specific situations so that most loose and/or hard-to-delimit relations across para-graph boundaries are excluded. This restriction ap-pears to be quite effective, as shown in Table 2. last 5 wks 1103 90.0 (90.0/89.9) 80.8 last 3 wks 677 91.0 (91.0/91.0) 82.5 last 2 wks 499 91.8 (91.8/91.8) 84.2 We have presented a discourse annotation scheme for Chinese that adopts the lexically ground ap-proach of the PDTB while making systematic adap-tations motivated by characteristics of Chinese text. These adaptations not only work well in practice, as evidenced by the results from our annotation exper-iment, but also embody a more generalized view of the lexically ground approach to discourse annota-tion: Discourse relations are predication involving two arguments; the predicate can be either covert (i.e. Implicit) or overt, lexicalized as discourse con-nectives (i.e. Explicit) or their more polymorphous counterparts (i.e. AltLex). Consistent with this generalized view is a more semantically motivated sense annotation scheme: Senses of discourse rela-tions (as opposed to just connectives) are annotated; and the two arguments of the discourse relation are semantically defined, allowing the sense structure to be more general and less connective-dependent. These framework-level generalizations can be ap-plied to discourse annotation of other languages.
