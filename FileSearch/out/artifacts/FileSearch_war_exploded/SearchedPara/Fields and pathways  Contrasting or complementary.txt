 1. Introduction
This research compares and contrasts two conceptions of information behavior, particularly as they re-late to information seeking, one focusing on the more static notion of field and the other on the more dy-namic conception of pathways. Both of these views offer different insights on the relationship between context and information seeking, a problem increasingly viewed as a central issue in information behavior research ( Cool, 2001; Dervin, 1997, 2003; Johnson, 2003; Pettigrew, Fidel, &amp; Bruce, 2001; Talja, Keso, &amp;
Pietilainen, 1999 ). Indeed, a persistent theoretical problem in the social sciences more generally is account-ing for individual action in a social context (e.g., Dervin, 1980; Emirbayer &amp; Mische, 1998; Savolainen, 1995 ).

Information seeking is one of many actions an individual may choose to engage in; it cannot be sepa-rated from the specific context in which it occurs. Increasingly research in information behavior has turned to contextual explanations and concepts like information horizon and information grounds ( Fisher, Dur-rance, &amp; Hinton, 2004; Sonnenwald, Wildemuth, &amp; Harmon, 2001 ). Here we will focus on the context of genomic information seeking to illustrate our arguments, an area that has been termed the perfect informa-tion seeking research problem ( Johnson, Andrews, Case, &amp; Allard, in press ). Information seeking is gov-erned by available information carriers, norms related to appropriate behaviors, and individual beliefs; thus, it provides a focus for efforts to develop a more general theory of individual action. In the following sections we will detail how fields and pathways provide alternative approaches to the classic problems in information behavior specified in Table 1 . 1.1. Information seeking
Information seeking can be defined simply as the purposive acquisition of information from selected information carriers ( Johnson, 1996, 1997a ). Information carriers may include a variety of channels, a vari-ety of sources within channels, and a variety of messages contained within these sources. There are many, often contradictory senses of information, here we will focus on the classic one of being able to discern pat-terns of matter and energy in the world around us ( Johnson, 1996 ). 1.2. Fields
One conception of an information environment is that of the information field within which the individ-ual is embedded ( Cool, 2001 ). An individual  X  s information field provides the starting point for information seeking ( Rice, McCreadie, &amp; Chang, 2001 ). It represents the typical arrangement of information stimuli to which an individual is regularly exposed ( Johnson, 1996, 1997a ), the information resources they routinely use ( Sonnenwald et al., 2001 ). The concept of field has a long tradition in the social sciences tracing back to the seminal work of Lewin ( Scott, 2000 ) with interesting recent variants such as the information horizons approach suggested by Sonnenwald et al. (2001) .
 An individual  X  s information field provides the more static context for their information seeking (see
Table 1 ). Information fields contain resources, constraints, and carriers of information ( Johnson, 1996, 1997a; Rice et al., 2001 ). Individuals are embedded in a physical world that involves recurring contacts with an interpersonal network of friends and/or family. They are also regularly exposed to the same mediated communication channels (company news bulletins, local newspapers, television news, and so on). Typically a person  X  s local information field consists of an interpersonal communication network (or social field in
Perin  X  s, 1991 ; terms) and information terminals (e.g., FAX machines), both of which are embedded within a physical context. This physical context serves to stabilize an individual  X  s information field and in large part determines the nature of information individuals are exposed to on a regular basis ( Johnson, 1996 ).
The information field an individual is located in constrains the very possibility of selecting particular sources of information.

People can, if they so desire, arrange the elements of their information fields to maximize their surveil-lance of health information, providing an initial contextualizing of their environment. They can regularly attend to television programming and they can subscribe to magazines with high proportions of health-related content. In other words, individuals who are more concerned with their health are likely to mold their information fields to include a richer mixture of health-related information sources. How they shape this field over-time determines not only their knowledge of general health issues but also their incidental exposure to information that may stimulate them to more purposive information seeking. In a sense, indi-viduals are embedded in a field that acts on them; the more traditional view of health campaigns. However, they also make choices about the nature of their fields, the types of media they attend to, the friendships they form and the neighborhoods they live in, which are often based on their information needs and preferences.

The nature of an individual  X  s stable information field can shape his/her more active information seeking, since it provides a starting point for information searches. Naturally an information field can be modified to reflect changes in an individual  X  s life, which at times are also directly related to changing information seek-ing demands. When an individual becomes a cancer patient, his/her interpersonal network changes to in-clude other cancer patients who are proximate during treatment. They also may be exposed to a greater array of mediated communication (e.g., pamphlets, videotapes, and so on) concerning the nature of their disease. As individuals become more focused in their information seeking they change the nature of their information field to support the acquisition of information related to particular purposes ( Kuhlthau, 1999 ).
In this sense, individuals act strategically to achieve their ends and in doing so construct local communica-tion structures in fields that mirror their interests ( Williamson, 1998 ).

In summation, people are embedded in information fields that determine their level of awareness and knowledge of particular issues. The nature of these fields also determines the likelihood that they will be exposed to information that may trigger a desire to seek more information or to change their behavior in some ways. The presence of weak ties, infrequent, unidimensional contacts with outgroup members, may expose them to information that suggests the possibility of change should at least be explored and this may trigger an expansion of the individual  X  s information field. In addition, the mediated channels individ-uals are recurrently exposed to through information terminals may incidentally contain information related to a communication campaign which causes them to seek more information. Of course, the experience of symptoms or the presence of someone in their immediate social network who has cancer also may cause an individual to expand their information fields to obtain information that can answer their immediate con-cerns ( Johnson, 1996, 1997a ). In some ways the total of someone  X  s information fields has analogs to the notion of social capital in that it describes the resources an individual has to draw upon when confronting a problem. When individuals share the same information field they also share a context which provides the information grounds for further interaction ( Fisher et al., 2004 ).
 1.3. Pathways
Individuals can pursue their information seeking within an information matrix formed by channels, sources, and messages. As Table 1 reveals, this conception of the context of information seeking is substan-tially different than that of fields. It is more dynamic and active, focusing on individual actions over-time in response sequences ( Emirbayer &amp; Mische, 1998 ). This movement over-time may result in changing contexts that are the direct result of individual choice and a response to what an individual has uncovered. In this sense, individual action is more mindful; although, over-time individuals may come to have habitual path-ways and/or plans for negotiating the information carrier matrix ( Taylor, 1968 ). A pathway then is the route someone follows in the pursuit of answers to questions.

In looking for prevention information I may decide upon a mediated communication channel, that com-bines authoritative information with a personal touch. Thus, I call my local hospital  X  s telephone hotline. If this telephone service proves unsatisfactory I may call the Cancer Information Service. This new source I evaluate to be more credible, partially because of the nature of the messages that are being transmitted to me. I might accept the information specialist  X  s message concerning the need for a screening mammography, but I consider the linkage she is suggesting between fat in my diet and breast cancer to be farfetched and discount it.

Some of the most interesting early work in this area was done by Pescosolido (1992) who identified  X  cas-cades  X  or strings in the selection of interpersonal sources of health information, concepts evocative of path-ways. Her research focused on medical care decisions and clusters that were associated with demographic factors and, most importantly, the social networks of people, which has stimulated subsequent research (e.g., Cauce et al., 2002; Pescosolido, Gardner, &amp; Lubell, 1998; Rosenfield &amp; Wenzel, 1997 ). Disturbingly physicians were not cited by respondents in two of the eight interpersonal source clusters in her 1992 study, in spite of the focus on recent severe health episodes. Three of the eight patterns revealed single source con-sultations (e.g., physicans alone), reflecting the disturbing lack of persistence of individuals in seeking help for their medical problems ( Johnson, 1997a ). Unfortunately, since she was dealing with static survey data, which did not focus on temporal sequences, as she concedes ( Pescosolido, 1992, p. 1128 ), while at a con-ceptual level she focused on pathways, her operationalization and analysis were closer to the notion of field.
Unlike a field, which I construct to meet my preferences, paths can uncover discordant sources of infor-mation, producing conflicts that must be resolved. In other words, I move within my matrix making deci-sions about how I will go about pursuing the information I want related to particular topics, which information I will accept and discard, and whether or not I need to continue my journey within the matrix.
My path within this matrix is dependent on what I find and how I react to this information. So,  X  X  ... an entity  X  s current state can be understood only in terms of the history of events that preceded it X  X  ( Poole,
Van de Ven, Dooley, &amp; Holmes, 2000, p. 12 ) and the impact of critical events ( Poole et al., 2000 ). This pro-cess in toto has been described as  X  muddling through  X  in an iterative, path dependent fashion for help seek-ing related to mental health problems ( Cauce et al., 2002 ). 1.4. Contrasting or complementary concepts
This research, then, will compare and contrast two different conceptions, fields and pathways, of indi-vidual information behavior. These different approaches imply different relationships between actors and their information environments and thus also encapsulate different views of the relationship between indi-vidual actions and contexts. Fields could be seen as embedded in classic causal approaches to human ac-tion, while pathways reflect more modern notions of narrative ( Sharf &amp; Vanderford, 2003 ) and a search for typical patterns ( Abbott, 1990 ). Similarly these conceptions in some ways represent the distinction between
 X  objectified  X  and  X  interpretive  X  approaches to context ( Talja et al., 1999 ). The operationalization of these conceptions used here are based on simple, elegant methods of data gathering transformed by analysis techniques: a battery of three questions based on respondents  X  unaided recall of the sources they would consult for information on inherited cancers, a particularly rich information seeking problem ( Johnson et al., in press; Mitchell, Fun, &amp; McCray, in press ). These operationalizations will be compared and con-trasted with a nomological network of related concepts drawn from an omnibus survey to determine their validity. 2. Methods 2.1. Survey method
These data are derived from responses to questions that were part of a statewide, telephone, general social survey of non-institutionalized residents 18 years of age or older of a border state. A total of 2454 phone numbers were called. There were a total of 125 ineligible (typically because they were not at least 18 years of age) respondents, and 1447 refusals or incomplete surveys, resulting in a total of 882 interviews completed. The margin of error for the sample was approximately +/ 3.3% at the 95% confidence level.
The sample characteristics proved comparable to 2000 census data for this state. 2.2. Approach to operationalizing fields and pathways
A battery of three questions was used to operationalize both fields and pathways. The primary difference in approach to these two concepts comes in how this raw data is transformed for analysis. The overall bat-tery of questions was introduced by the statement  X  X  X he next few questions are about genetic testing as a way for people to determine their risk for cancer X  X . This introductory phrase was then followed by three questions focusing on the extent these types of cancer ran in the family, their genetic literacy, and their ex-tent of worry about developing an inherited form of cancer.

The raw data is based on a series of three questions reflecting the carriers they would look to as sources of information  X  X  X f you were trying to find information about inherited cancers X  X ,  X  X  X here would be the
FIRST place you would go or look? X  X   X  X  X s there any other place you would go or look for information? X  X   X  X  X s there any place else you would go or look for information? X  X  This is a common approach to asking ques-tions concerning a general predisposition to channel usage and one that produces clearer results since it is not affected by the  X  noise  X  of various situational factors (e.g., accessibility) that might constrain channel use in practice ( Johnson, 1982 ). Raw data from these sets of questions will be used to operationalize the two concepts, fields and pathways, our focus here.

We used an unaided recall approach to uncover respondents  X  scripts  X  for information seeking. Survey interviewers classified responses into 15 frequently used channel categories (e.g., magazine, library) derived from prior research ( Johnson, 1997a; Muha &amp; Smith, 1998 ). 2.3. Nomological indicators of validity
Face validity for our approach is based on our review of prior research and by reviews by experts in information seeking of our questionnaire. To further assess construct validity we will examine the pattern of relationships between our operationalizations of fields and pathways and interrelated constructs. In gen-eral, Schwab (1980) suggests that researchers have not paid enough attention to the issue of construct valid-ity which should be examined before substantive research is performed. Essentially construct validity research assesses the correspondence between the construct and operational procedures used to measure or manipulate the construct. So, while we will examine substantive issues here this is done in the service of assessing the construct validity of fields and pathways.

One approach to establishing construct validity is to identify a network of other constructs within which the construct is embedded. Specifying theoretical linkages provides further validational linkages for con-structs (see Johnson, 1997b for another exemplar within communication focusing on the concept of fram-ing). This nomothetic network contains empirical relationships, such as group differences and correlations between variables, that provide evidence for the validity of the construct ( Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955 ). Thus, learning more about a construct  X  X  ... is a matter of elaborating the nomological network in which it occurs, ...  X  X  ( Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955, p. 290 ). Fortunately our companion studies also examined a range of other related variables that permits an assessment of the nomethetic networks for the constructs of fields and pathways ( Case, Johnson, Andrews, Allard, &amp; Kelley, 2004 ).

The initial three questions, reflecting antecedents in the comprehensive model of information seeking (CMIS) framework ( Johnson, 1997a; Johnson, Andrews, &amp; Allard, 2001 ), were concerned with the respon-dent  X  s awareness of cancer  X  running in their family  X  , their understanding of genetics ( Andrykowski, Munn, &amp; Studts, 1996 ), and their level of  X  worry  X  about inheriting cancer ( Kinney et al., 2000 ).
It is expected that utilization of the information field is directly influenced by the CMIS antecedents and how respondents view its characteristics. The final three questions concerned specialized information seek-ing actions: whether they would want or need help finding information on genetic testing and how much help they would need. The outcome variable of intent was measured with a single question used in prior research:  X  X  X ould you have a genetic test to determine your risk for inherited cancer if it were readily avail-able? X  X  ( Diefenbach, Schnoll, Miller, &amp; Brower, 2000 ). The questions in this genomics battery, then, form our substantive questions with richer more, diverse source usage in fields or pathways expected to be pos-itively associated with worry, understanding, and a family history of cancer. Similarly, following the liter-ature, we expect specialized actions to be positively related to pathways and fields ( Johnson, 1997a; Johnson et al., 2001 ).

The omnibus survey included a total of 156 questions submitted by a number of university researchers on a variety of topics. Basic demographic and social information collected for the survey as a whole in-cluded: gender, age, race, education, household income, marital status, and community size. Pescosolido (1992) examined similar social contingency variables in her seminal and subsequent research ( Pescosolido et al., 1998 ). We expect these factors to follow the classic prior research pattern of middle-aged, educated, white women, from higher socioeconomic status being more active information seekers in assessing the re-lative nomological validity of fields and pathways. 3. Results
In this section we will perform nomological analyses by descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and discriminant analyses on demographic and substantive variables to assess the relative validity of these con-structs. Before turning to these tasks we will describe the data from which these analyses emerge. 3.1. Preference for sources For their first choices for information, we found that respondents were most likely to first turn to the
Internet (46.5%) for information about genetics, second to a doctor (18.4%), third to a library (14.1%) and fourth to a family member (10.6%). Other medical sources [hospital programs, the Cancer Information
Service (CIS), or county health officials] together counted for an additional 8.7% of responses. Mass media sources (newspapers, magazines, and TV) together made up one per cent of responses, while friends ac-counted for less than one per cent of their first choices. Some potential information sources were mentioned rarely, or not at all (e.g., child  X  s school, church, and radio programming). Similar patterns, save for a switch between second (49.8%) and third (47.0%) place for doctors and the public library respectively, were re-ported when responses were tallied across all three choices. There was a dramatic drop off in the persistence of seeking, with 817 people reporting a first choice, but only 303 reporting a third one. 3.2. Information field: cluster analysis
To parallel the analysis by Pescosolido (1992) we combined certain responses and then converted the data to a binary, chosen/not chosen, matrix of source choices. The four infrequently-chosen mass media sources (magazine, newspaper, national TV programming and local TV programming) were combined into one  X  X  X ass media X  X  source variable. The few choices of  X  X  X  friend at work X  X  were combined with  X  X  X  family friend X  X  to form one  X  X  X riends X  X  source variable. Then the ranking data (first, second, third choice indicators) were collapsed into a simple, named-source/did-not-name-source sequence of ones and zeros for each respondent. Thus, the clustering begins with an M  X  N non-symmetrical matrix with M representing the cases and N the sources. Less popular sources were merged with similar items to represent the nine most common sources of information from the original total of 15: Internet, doctor, library, hospital programs, county health, CIS, mass media (newspapers, magazines, and TV), family members, and friends (including child  X  s school and church).

A number of clustering approaches and solutions were attempted using the TwoStep Cluster Analysis routines from SPSS (version 11.5). As in the analysis by ( Pescosolido, 1992, p. 1130 ), the best method for clustering these data involves forming non-hierarchical clusters based on Euclidian distances. The  X  X  X ensity Matrix X  X  (see Table 2 ), reflects the clusters and their respective patterns of source preferences. Fol-lowing Pescosolido (1992) we simplify each cluster by choosing 36% as a minimum cut-off point for indi-cating a preference for each source (meaning that at least 36% of the members of that cluster chose that source). 3.3. Profiling clusters
The overall results, as in Pescosolido (1992) , suggested that there were unique patterns of sources con-sulted by different sets of individuals that can be parsimoniously  X  X  X rofiled X  X .

Cluster 1 could be called  X  X  X uthoritative X  X . These are respondents ( n = 290) who rely chiefly on the library as a source, usually in combination with the Internet and possibly a doctor. On average, this cluster con-tains the youngest (mean = 45.5 years) and wealthiest respondents.

Cluster 2 respondents ( n = 196) were  X  X  X clectic X  X , they tended to use all sources to some degree. They were the only significant users of friends (9% consulted them), plus the mass media and a variety of other medical consultants (county health departments, hospitals, and the CIS). Among all the groups, this was the one whose members were most interested in having a genetic test performed. Cluster 2 members had better lit-eracy ( n = 842, v 2 = 35.47, df = 9, p &lt; .05). Membership in a cluster had a significant relationship with racial/ethnic background (coded as White/Non-White).

Respondents ( n = 144) in Cluster 3 had a  X  X  X amily Dominant X  X  profile. These respondents were the only significant users of family members. As a group it contained the poorest respondents, and those more likely to say they would need  X  X  X ome X  X  or  X  X  X  lot X  X  of help in deciding about genetic testing.

Cluster 4 includes the  X  X  X east Effort X  X  respondents ( n = 252). If members of this cluster use any source at all, they tend to rely strictly on the Internet and their doctor. On average, this cluster contains the oldest (mean = 50.9 years) respondents, those claiming the weakest understanding of genetics, and having the least interest in having a genetic test. Respondents describing their understanding as  X  X  X oor X  X  or  X  X  X air X  X  were more likely to be in Cluster 4. 3.4. Nomological results for clusters
As will be so with the parallel pathways analyses that follow, here we employ one-way ANOVA and dis-criminant analysis to examine relationships between the respondent clusters that represent differing fields and the results from demographic and substantive (i.e., genetics-related) questions. The one-way ANOVAs of cluster group membership found the following variables to be significant: literacy ( F (3,838) = 6.43; p &lt; .05); age ( F (3,869) = 5.58; p &lt; .05) and income ( F (3,648) = 3.53; p &lt; .05).

In a more focused way, to further examine the nomological properties of pathways, stepwise discrimi-nant analyses (see Klecka, 1980 ), using the demographic and substantive variables that had a very high pro-portion of responders, were conducted to explore what the relative impact of these variables for determining different clusters. This discriminant analysis was conducted to confirm that membership in the two most distinct clusters [Cluster 1 (Authoritative) and Cluster 3 (Family Dominant)] was predictable from the nomological variables. The analysis found race (coded as white versus minority .78) and amount of help needed about genetic testing (.63) to be significant predictors of membership in these two clusters (see Table 3 ). These coefficients may be interpreted in much the same way as beta weights in a regression analysis or factor loadings in a factor analysis. The resulting discriminant function was able to correctly classify 63% of cases using these two variables alone. 3.5. Identifying pathways
Pathways embody respondent  X  s sequential selection of sources of information. We identified 16 path-ways that at least 23 respondents shared ( n = 642) with 240 (27.2%) respondents reporting no or highly idio-syncratic patterns. The seven one-step patterns, with only one source consulted, were: hospital ( n = 34, 5.3%), CIS (27, 4.2%), do not know (33, 5.1%), doctor X  X one (47, 7.3%), family member X  X one (31, 4.8%), library X  X one (29, 4.5%), and Internet X  X one (78, 12.1%). (We did not count the lack of specification of a source as a step.) The seven two-step paths with one source, followed by an explicit second choice were: doctor then Internet (41, 6.4%), doctor then library (32, 5.0%), library then Internet (36, 5.6%) library then doctor (23, 3.6%), Internet then library then none (79, 12.3%), Internet then doctor then none (39, 6.1%), and Internet then family member then none (24, 3.7%). Only two patterns were frequent enough at the third stage for nomological analysis: Internet then library then doctor (51, 7.9%) and Internet then doctor then library (38, 5.9%). Fig. 1 graphically describes the pathways emanating from the Internet in the first step.
As conventions sources have similar shapes (e.g., stars for none) at the different steps, with bolding for the paths chosen by over 50 people.
 3.6. Nomological results for pathways
We compared the substantive and demographic variables for all the pathways. Partly because of the small n  X  s involved for each pathway, no patterns could be detected for racial and ethnic background. Be-cause of the large numbers of comparisons it is difficult to locate particular patterns with a high degree of certainty for the demographic variables, although there were some provocative departures that can be ob-tained from the corresponding author. For example, community size appeared to be particularly related to pathways that involved libraries, with respondents in larger communities more likely to report library path-ways, probably because of access issues, in conjunction with other sources, while the library X  X one path was most likely to be associated with smaller communities.

Sixteen comparisons are almost unworkable, so we decided to also analyze the data in more summative and focused ways. In a summative sense, we collapsed all of the one, two, and three step patterns, then con-ducted one-way ANOVA  X  s to compare means. Similarly to past research, providing nomological support, richer pathways were significantly ( p &lt; .05) related with higher education ( F (2,598) = 7.12), larger commu-nities ( F (2,636) = 4.09), higher household income ( F (2,489) = 8.04), and younger respondents ( F (2,635) = 13.53). The LSD results demonstrated that the most important differences were between the first and latter steps. For the substantive variables, only literacy ( F (2,630) = 3.84) had a significant ( p &lt; .05) difference.

We also conducted discriminant analyses of two of the specific pathways at each step to see if dif-ferent patterns emerged (see Table 3 ). For the significant one step pathway function, comparing doc-tors X  X one ( n = 47) and family X  X one ( n = 31), two variables loaded on the stepwise discriminant function: age (1.02) and worry ( .81). For the two step pathways, comparing doctor X  X nternet ( n = 41) and Internet X  X amily X  X one ( n = 24), two variables, literacy (.97) and education ( .75), loaded on the significant stepwise discriminant function. The three step discriminant analysis compared Inter-net X  X ibrary X  X octor ( n = 51) and Internet X  X octor X  X ibrary ( n = 38), the only comparisons possible. None of the nomological variables entered ( F = 3.84) the analysis for three steps. Accordingly, no results are reported. 4. Discussion
We believe these results, emanating from a relatively simple battery of three questions, produced very rich data that suggested new insights into information behavior. The nomological results, while replicating classic demographic findings, also suggested a fertile ground for future theoretical development. To ad-vance this area we will focus first on the new methods and analysis techniques that are suggested by our results, then we compare and contrast fields and pathways, suggesting which approach might be preferred for particular problems. 4.1. Implications for methods and analytic techniques
As Poole et al. (2000) detail in their book describing the methods and analysis techniques developed over two decades by the Minnesota Innovation Research Program, approaching a phenomenon from new per-spectives at times requires tortuous and demanding attention to fundamental issues. Sonnenwald et al. (2001) have recently embarked on such a journey for their concept of information horizon. New perspec-tives require new methods that truly capture the conceptual and theoretic issues that do not classically fit into the  X  normal science  X  paradigm. More generally, as we have seen, social scientists have yet to convinc-ingly develop a widely accepted, multifaceted approach to individual action in context, especially over time.
While the method we used here, unaided recall of sources one might consult for a particular information seeking problem, is relatively simple in execution, as we have seen, the analytic choices, which we return to shortly, can quickly become complex.

Our relatively simple approach here asked people what they thought they would do, evoking scripted behavior, but these intentions often change dramatically in any one actual pathway emblematic of a par-ticular search. This, coupled with highly fragmented nature of information fields, suggests that very ambi-tious studies would need to be conducted to detect and identify the extant typologies and compare and contrast them for their unique properties.

In many ways comparisons of fields and pathways is fundamentally about the difference between se-quenced, dependent actions and a more deterministic clusters of variables. Fields and information horizons may represent the initial starting points of pathways, with a particular field often shaped by various con-textual factors. For pathways more of a process, narrative approach, which is still being developed, that departs from standard longitudinal, cross-sectional approach, is needed ( Poole et al., 2000 ).
For example, event sequences and their properties need to be characterized. Here, new forms of graphic representations are often critical to our understanding of phenomenon in this area ( Pescosolido &amp; Rubin, 2000 ). One of the interesting problems empirically with sequences is that while many possibilities exist, only a few are actually used empirically ( Abbott, 1990 ). Thus, we found only two patterns at three steps of suf-ficient size to analyze. These two patterns, Internet then doctor then library and Internet then library then doctor were not discriminated by our nomological variables. However, a substantive argument could be advanced that they are indeed different. The former could indicate people who do not fully trust informa-tion provided by their doctor or individuals who are double checking conflicting information from the doc-tor and the Internet, while the latter could indicate individuals who want to be fully prepared before they visit the doctor. This is somewhat confirmed by the differences between Clusters 1 and 3 and the relative role of libraries, which are often ignored in research in this area. These suggested usages have also been found in empirical research in this area ( Fox &amp; Rainie, 2002; Taylor &amp; Leitman, 2002 ). 4.2. Comparing fields and pathways
The data reported here contain several provocative results. First, as we have described in more detail in a companion paper ( Case et al., 2004 ), the Internet appears to have supplanted mass media channels ( Fox &amp;
Rainie, 2002; Sonnenwald et al., 2001 ). However, the Internet itself represents a cluster of information matrices that for some people may be interpersonal (e.g., a chat room), authoritative (e.g., National Insti-tutes of Health web sites), or mass media (e.g., MSNBC). Because of its ubiquity, future research should
 X  break down  X  web usage into subcategories to enrich analysis, either through features analysis (e.g., degree of interactivity), sponsorship (e.g., government, commercial), or multiplexity (e.g., media, newspaper sites).
A somewhat similar issue exists for the libraries, which for some respondents means access to the Internet, for others books, and for still others the services of a reference librarian. Second, perhaps because of the highly personal nature of this information seeking problem, which often leads to interesting family dyna-mics ( Johnson et al., in press ), friends do not have the prevalence as an information source that studies in other contexts have reported ( Johnson, 1997a ), although they do play a role in Cluster 2 along with four other sources.

In all we found 16 pathways and four clusters, but there should be many more possibilities given the large number of combinatorial possibilities of 15 sources over three steps ( Abbott, 1990 ). Moreover, only six sources were chosen by more than 4% of respondents across all steps: the Internet, library, doctor, family member, CIS, and hospital program. While there may be some commonalities across information fields, individual  X  s information environments are becoming so fragmented, driven by individual contextu-alizing, that assessing media effects (or campaign ones) is increasingly difficult.

There is suggestive evidence in our nomological data, at least at the early steps, that these different pos-sibilities do make a difference. Exploring these differences in part awaits larger scale empirical studies to detail the major patterns that exist (e.g., Fox &amp; Rainie, 2002 ), as well as more focused empirical studies on individual patterns to determine their significance. For example, Lowery and Anderson (2002) suggested prior web use impacts respondent  X  s perception of physicians, with heavy users of online information signi-ficantly less likely to see physicians as the exclusive experts on medical decision-making, undermining their control, while at the same time empowering individuals. There appears to be an interesting split among
Internet users, with as many as 60% of users reporting that while they look for information, they only rely on it if their doctors tell them to, while 38% of users judge the information on their own without consulting their doctor ( Taylor &amp; Leitman, 2002 ). This is reflected in the differences between Clusters 1 and 4 with the relative importance of libraries in 4. In some ways it also may be even more interesting theoretically to dis-cern why some possibilities do not occur (e.g., church then family then Internet).

The most variety and the most interesting differences occur across pathways found at the first and second steps. One clear issue is the differential importance of varying nomological factors for different pathways, something clearly revealed in the discriminant analyses. Thus, these actions appear to relate to different  X  ac-tive ingredients  X  of context suggesting the richness of future inquiry ( Johnson, 2003 ). A very revealing set of differences was that related to library usage and community size, with the library being the sole source of information in smaller communities, while it is used in conjunction with other sources in larger communi-ties, reiterating libraries  X  important role in serving rural health information needs ( Vavrek, 1995 ). Given the different patterns of findings, each cluster and pathway may form its own unique context. Some people only search long enough to find a plausible answer, others wait until they have corroborating information, while, sadly, others hope for inconsistency as an excuse for delaying action ( Johnson, 1996, 1997a ). A focus on pathways offers much hope for future research in this fecund area.

Interestingly, as they move along the pathways people become more similar, as do their paths, which may be in part because of the oft noted lack of persistence across multiple sources (which we also found here) in information seeking ( Johnson, 1996, 1997a ). This raises the question of whether all persistent seek-ers are persistent in the same way. Certainly the nomological results suggested few differences in the empi-rical pathways discernible at the third steps. While persistence is a particularly important issue for pathways, it also has implications for the richness of one  X  s information field. 5. Conclusions
Fundamentally all communication and information behavior must occur within a context. In part, what we have been focusing on here are two different views, fields and pathways, of the context of information seeking that reflect different historical developments. Traditionally, in the US, there has also been more of a focus on individuals and their rational, cognitive attributes, down-playing the social worlds of interpersonal contexts within which people seek help ( Johnson &amp; Meischke, 1993; Pescosolido, 1992; Pescosolido et al., 1998 ). In researching how people obtain mental health services, Pescosolido et al. (1998) describe a complex process of coercion from institutions and family/friendship networks coupled with some  X  muddling  X  through, neither of which is characteristic of the dominant rational individual choice model.

An approach that has information seeking as its focus inherently tries to picture the world of the actor and the self-interests that motivate him/her to particular behaviors ( Dervin, 1980 ). But individuals, of course, are not totally free of constraints which govern their actions. They depend on others for informa-tion and for services and the general societal framework in which they are embedded restricts the range of questions and alternatives that can be pursued. How is individual agency limited and shaped by the larger information fields and carriers that compose an individual  X  s information environment? This context ques-tion, then, lies at the heart of any future research efforts related to information seeking. Fields and path-ways offer both contrasting and complementary approaches to this fundamental problem (see Table 1 ).
Pathways imply longitudinal research designs and special analytic techniques that are only slowly being developed in the social sciences. The results, especially at the further reaches of one  X  s journey may be highly idiosyncratic, shaped by unique events. Because of the large number of possible paths, large scale research projects are needed to develop an understanding of the various unique combinations. Fields, a more con-ventional approach, with somewhat settled static methods and analytic techniques, are the information horizons that provide starting points for these journeys, providing a set of initial conditions, often deter-mined by accessibility, that shape the likelihood of someone  X  s ultimate success. In some ways these two ap-proaches are akin to the classic differences between strategies and tactics, with the former determining a general approach to an ultimate goal and the latter the specific actions that result in the goal  X  s accomplish-ment. Ultimately, mastery of life depends on both approaches operating in concert with the other. Acknowledgement We would like to thank the reviewers for their suggestions that improved this article.
