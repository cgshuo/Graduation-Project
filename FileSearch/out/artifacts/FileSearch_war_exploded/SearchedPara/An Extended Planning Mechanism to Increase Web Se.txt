 ronment. There are several key issues to smoothing the Web service mechanism in a vice planning which is done by the service planning agent. ment without much interference of human decision. Most service matching algorithms own effort before resorting to the service requester. out human interaction. sents the service matching cases of Plugin match and Non-Plugin match with further presents the related work with the conclusion following. Exact, Plugin [9][14] and non-Plugin match. The Exact match is subsumed by Plugin match, so every match case converges to Plugin and non-Plugin match. The matching (DL)[20]. 2.1 Definition of Matching Type Service (RS), Provider (P) and Provider X  X  Service (PS). Definition 1. Concept-Spectrum (ConS) A set of concepts that compose the in-part or out-part in conjunctive form. Definition 2. Concept-Depth (ConD) conjunctive form. It can be specified as follows:  X  ConD of PS X  X  out-part : A set of PS X  X  out-part concepts that also exists in RS X  X   X  ConD of RS X  X  out-part : A set of RS X  X  out-part concepts that also exists in PS X  X  have a corresponding concept of PS X  X  in-part by definition. Definition 3. Services R Sand PS is Exact Matching if, (For in-part) ConS of RS.in-part(c) = ConS of PS.in-part(c) and ConD of RS.in-part(c) = ConD of PS.in-part(c) (For out-part) ConS of RS.out-part(c) = ConS of PS.out-part(c) and ConD of RS.out-part(c) = ConD of PS.out-part(c) match [14] can be expressed as, Match plugin (RS,PS) = (RS pre  X  PS pre )  X  (PS post  X  RS post ) Definition 4. Services RS and PS is Plugin Matching if, (For in-part) of PS.in-part(c) (For out-part) ConD of PS.out-part(c) demand are available in provider X  X  supply, i.e., RS is not satisfied by PS. Definition 5 Service RS and PS is non-Plugin Matching if, (For in-part) ConD of PS.in-part(c)) (For out-part) ConD of PS.out-part(c)) 2.2 Matching Cases scribed below. Type-A, PluginC (Plugin match without Concept Restriction) (1) Match-1: In-PluginC (in-part PluginC)  X  Result: Satisfied.  X  Solution: Return the matched service.  X  Consideration: False Positive (Maybe finds surplus not wanted answer) (Example) RS.in-part: (Picture, Genre, Museum, Time) PS.in-part: (Picture, Genre, Museum) (2) Match-2 : Out-PluginC (out-part PluginC)  X  Result: Satisfied.  X  Solution : Return the matched service.
 Type-B, PluginCR (Plugin match with Concept Restriction) (3) Match-3 : In-PluginCR (in-part Plugin match for Concept Restriction)  X  Result: Satisfied.  X  Solution: Return the matched service. (4) Match-4 : Out-PluginCR (out-part Plugin match for Concept Restriction)  X  Result: Satisfied.  X  Solution: Return the matched service.  X  Consideration: False Negative (Maybe can X  X  find a result that should be done). Type-C, nPluginC (no Plugin match without Concept Restriction) Some concepts in request are not satisfied by provider X  X  service. (5) Match-5.: In-nPluginC (in-part non Plugin match for Concept)  X  Result: Need to be expanded. (6) Match-6 : Out-nPluginC (out-part non Plugin match for Concept)  X  Result: Need to be expanded.  X  Solution: Find a service that gets RS X  X  in-part as in-part and returns RS X  X  not (Example) RS.out-part: (Museum  X  .location.West, Title  X  .( &lt; stringsize 30), Genre) PS.out-part: (Museum  X  .location.West, Title  X  .( &lt; stringsize 30)) Type-D, nPluginCR (no Plugin match with Concept Restriction) cept restriction. (7) Match-7: in-PluginCR (out-part non Plugin match for Concept Restriction )  X  Condition: (Match-7-1) (In-nPluginCR) (concept conflict cases for 7B and 7C)  X  Result: Can X  X  get the service.  X  Solution: No solution, return Fail. (Example) RS.in-part: (Painter  X  .nationality.Italy, Time  X  .(  X  year 1880) PS.in-part: (Painter  X  .nationality.France, Time  X  .(  X  year 1880) (Match-7-2) (In-nPluginCR) (non concept conflict case for 7A)  X  Result: Need to be expanded. (Match-7-3) (In-nPluginCR) (non concept conflict case for 7B)  X  Result: Satisfied.  X  Solution: Return the matched service.  X  Consideration: False Positive (Maybe finds surplus not wanted answer) (Match-7-4) (In-nPluginCR) (non concept conflict case for 7C)  X  Result: Need to be expanded. which is not in RS X  X  in-part but in PS X  X  in-part.  X  Consideration: False Positive (Maybe finds surplus not wanted answer) (8) Match-8: Out-nPluginCR (out-part non Plugin match for Concept Restriction )  X  Condition: (Match-8-1) (Out-nPluginCR) (concept conflict cases for 8B and 8C)  X  Result: Can X  X  get the service.  X  Solution: No solution, return Fail. (Match-8-2) (Out-nPluginCR) (non concept conflict case for 8A)  X  Result: Need to be expanded.  X  Solution: Find a service that gets RS X  X  in-part as in-part and returns RS X  X  not  X  Effect: False Negative (Example) RS.out-part: (Museum  X  .location. West, Title  X  .( &lt; stringsize 30), PS.out-part: (Museum  X  .location.USA, Genre  X  .genre.StillLife)) (Match-8-3) (Out-nPluginCR) (non concept conflict case for 8B)  X  Result: Satisfied  X  Solution: Return the matched service.  X  Consideration: False Positive (Match-8-4) (Out-nPluginCR) (non concept conflict case for 8C)  X  Result: Need to be expanded.  X  Solution: Find a service that gets RS X  X  in-part as in-part and returns RS X  X  not  X  Consideration: False Positive 3.1 Planning Description (Explanatory Example A) sider the following P and R X  X  service definition. Web Service Requester(R): Web service provider 1(P1): Web service provider 2(P2): described here, the user X  X  request of RS1 can be satisfied. out-part that current service can X  X  cover. 3.2 Planning Tree Generation with the planning domain described above. The planning tree consists of Reference service, Current service and New service. cases, the planning agent defines new service goals(New) to complement the Current 3.3 Service Grounding The service grounding is done using WSDL in SOAP protocol.

If the RS1 is  X  X ind Pictures and Genres with Painters of Vincent Van Gogh, Claude Monet and Pablo Picasso X  with the following grounding service results of PS1, PS2 and PS3, the final answer for RS1 is: PS2(in-part:Painter/out-part:Nationality) returns the following information. PS3(in-part:Painter,Picture/out-part:Genre) returns the following information. approach that requires only an abstract level description of complex service. cases of non-Plugin match. according to each match type even though there is no Plugin match services. satisfiable service. 
WSDL [4] based matching processes are proposed by [12][15][21]. Wang [12] pre-sents a Web service matching algorithm with WSDL specification through multi step ence that we do the extended matching process for the request. service utilization through the extended Web service planning. The suggested mecha-more in the future. between requesters and providers.
