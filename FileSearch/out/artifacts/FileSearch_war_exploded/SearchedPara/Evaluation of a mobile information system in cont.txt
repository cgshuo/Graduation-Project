 1. Introduction
A wide range of digital content is increasingly being supported on mobile devices and users X  expectations are growing. The need for an ambient information environment becomes more evident in the case of the mobile traveller where situated information access is one of the main challenges.

We present our approach and the user studies conducted when developing a mobile application for trav-ellers and tourists. The way these studies were conducted enabled progress between each as part of a larger aim. The overall purpose was to enable easy access to relevant content on mobile phones in the vicinity of physical objects, rooms, and open areas. We delivered information to provide an enriched and ambient information experience. This was achieved through the following: a new way to distribute mobile information; our wireless tags; and with travel and tourism content (see Fig. 1 ). From the user X  X  perspective, the thrust is about having mobile information access and receiving relevant information in the situation. Seen from an information retrieval perspective, it is about populating people X  X  handhelds and the vicinity with search engines, browsing, and alert facilities. The system was evaluated in context by using our evaluation method-ology, described later.

Iterative development of both the information and the information system is important to help us improve the quality of the information, system, and interaction. When asked to imagine how the system may or should be, it is difficult for users to express requirements prior to using or previewing a prototype. The requirements typ-ically come incrementally in stages once prototypes are shown to the user and sometimes can be implicit in their behaviours. Hence, the importance of conducting user studies in context . In order to do this, an evalu-ation framework that can be used across a variety of situations and systems is needed.

The paper presents a description of the system (Section 2 ) followed by some background and related work (Section 3 ). This is followed by the methodology and its overall principles (Section 4 ). Section 5 , presents the overall progress regarding how the methodology was used. Subsequently, Sections 6 X 8 describe the 1st, 2nd and 3rd user studies conducted in Seville respectively, along with a selection of results. We do this to illustrate how one can use the methodology. There are also connections to a larger scale background survey. Section 9 provides a discussion regarding the methodology and its guidelines. Section 10 presents conclusions. 2. Overall system description
Our system, AmbieSense, was developed to provide ambient, personalised, and context-aware applications that better meet peoples X  information needs. Our aim was to enable a more seamless interaction between the mobile users, their physical environment and the situations they encounter in addressing their information needs. We were building the system and needed to test out the content, software, hardware, architecture, and user interaction.

The system has three cornerstones: a specifically developed wireless tag , a content service provider , and the user with a mobile device  X  Fig. 2 . The system integrates our own wireless tag technology with information from content service providers. The content is from a general travel guide publisher, Lonely Planet Publica-tions, and local information providers such as the City Council of Seville.

From a user X  X  perspective, the final system enables a user to perform the following information seeking tasks: Browse the content via categories.
 Search for content via queries to a search engine.

Walk around in the surroundings and automatically receive content pop-ups within particular information zones.

The user can also receive recommendations or personalised search results based on explicit or implicit pref-erences. The system supports the simultaneous execution of several of the above tasks at the same time. E.g., the user can walk and receive content from the surroundings whilst also browsing or searching. A scenario is given below in order to illustrate the possible ways a user can seek and be notified of information in such systems.
User scenario: The tourist arrives at the destination city. The local tourist board has mounted wireless tags at different places in the city to provide relevant information, for example about each place and the environ-ment around. When the user is at these places, he has possibility to access this information on the mobile device.

In the hotel reception, in the vicinity of a wireless tag, the tourist installs on their personal mobile device the software that gives access to the system. The tourist then leaves the hotel and starts to explore the city. Our tourist has access to travel guide content originating from a variety of sources and a map on the phone/device.
He can search and browse for information as he walks around in the city and receives some pop-up informa-tion about specific places when he is nearby a wireless tag.

He is interested in cathedrals, so he specifies to the mobile client a search on  X  X  X athedral X  X . Several items of information on cathedral(s) appear for him to choose from. He decides to walk to the cathedral and considers the interesting features to look out for.

After the visit to the cathedral, he stops for a coffee in a cafe  X  . He browses for events and festivals that may be on. There are several flamenco events.

He is also interested in shopping. He continues to walk around the city and receives a pop-up of special offers in a shopping centre nearby.

We have described, above, the main elements of the system from the user X  X  perspective. From a technical vice providers may provide online information directly to a user, but also via the networked wireless tags mounted in various strategic places thus creating an information zone. Information can be uploaded, from remote, via WiFi or Ethernet and is then accessible locally to the user who is in that environment and situa-tion. For example, in the context of a travel guide, the historic and cultural information, local sights, shops, maps, and local events can be communicated to the mobile phones. Further details of the system and reference architecture developed and implemented can be found in Myrhaug, Whitehead, Go  X  ker, Faegri, and Lech (2004) . A demonstration of some of the applications has been presented ( Go  X  ker, Yakici, Bierig, &amp; Myrhaug, 2004, Go  X  ker et al., 2004 ).

This is a system that presents novel challenges because of context, the mobile environment, and the way in which the users interact with the environment and the system. Therefore, we needed a new method to evaluate the system whilst also developing and improving it. Hence, the remaining part of the paper covers some back-ground and related work for our methodology followed by a description of it and the main principles. Sub-sequently, we present the user studies where each study had an aim and role within the larger framework. 3. Background and related work
There are a number of different criteria for developing and evaluating our system. Context information has been an important consideration in developing our system. Within IR research, context information provides an important basis for identifying and understanding users X  information needs. Cool and Spink in a special issue on Context in Information Retrieval ( Cool &amp; Spink, 2002 ) provide an overview of the different levels in which context for information retrieval interest exists.

With regards to evaluation, there is much continuing discussion within information retrieval about the need for further research on more user-centred approaches. The need for realism in experiments has been empha-sised by Borlund and Ingwersen ( Borlund &amp; Ingwersen, 1997 ) who also discussed the conflict between a lab-oratory and operational environment. Early work in conducting situated studies in IR can be found in
Go  X  ker X  X  work as referred to in ( Go  X  ker, 1997 ). Task-oriented views have been considered important ( Reid, 2000; Vakkari, 2001 ) and other notions of relevance such as situational relevance have also been discussed ( Borlund, 2003 ). It is now increasingly accepted to plan for situated studies. This work has been influenced by the approaches to relevance as described in Saracevic X  X  earlier work ( Saracevic, 1976; Saracevic &amp; Kantor, 1988a, 1988b ). Mizzaro (1997) gives a comprehensive account of the discussions and approaches to relevance while also stressing the importance of situational relevance and the task that the user is trying to achieve.
Within mobile human X  X omputer interaction, Kjeldskov and Graham (2003) highlight a similar concern about the lack of realism in experiments. In their review of 102 papers in the field, they found a clear bias towards building systems and evaluating them only in laboratory settings, if at all. Our overall aim in the stud-ies was to get results from (real) operational environments and to improve both our system and the informa-tion (content) within it incrementally  X  whilst also checking and improving our methodology iteratively.
Saracevic (1995) stated that many approaches may be used in evaluation  X  but that the choice depends on the intent. He states that both system and user-centred approaches are needed and should  X  X  X ork together and feed on each other X  X . Our work has been an arena for both approaches.

Dix, Finlay, Abowd, and Beale (2004) raised the point that requirements for an interactive system may not be thoroughly specified from the beginning of the development life cycle  X  which states the need for iterative and progressive development. Iqbal, Sturm, Kulyk, Wang, and Terken (2005) point to work of Goguen and
Linde (1993) , which indicated that many large X  X cale projects have failed in the past. Iqbal et al. (2005) believe one of the key reasons for this was an inadequate analysis of user requirements. Social, political, and cultural issues (i.e., aspects of the context) have not been considered generally.

Scholtz (2006) , in considering metrics for evaluating information systems, focuses on information needs, tasks, and operational environments of information analysts in the National Institute of Standards and Tech-nology (NIST) in the US. Scholtz identifies the differences of performance/algorithm evaluations usability/inter-action evaluation, and overall impact/process evaluation. The metrics to be used depend on the type of evaluation and what it is designed to achieve. The work refers to evaluations that are iterative and presents meth-odologies, and results from three settings: laboratory, simulated environment, and operational environment.
In choosing evaluation approaches and metrics for information systems, from time to time, it can be useful to observe the following two debates. One on  X  X  X ormative vs. summative evaluation X  X , the other on  X  X  X uantita-tive vs. qualitative methods X  X .

On the whole, formative studies are intended to inform us on how to improve the system and summative studies (typically quantitative) are intended to provide information on whether the  X  X  X roduct X  X  is doing what it was meant to do. Formative evaluation is often conducted more than once ( Scriven, 1991 ; for earlier founda-tion see Scriven, 1967 ). Summative evaluation is a process of identifying larger patterns and trends in perfor-mance and judging these summary statements against criteria to obtain performance ratings, for example.
When conducting studies, it can be useful to consider the possibility of these distinctions and where the tran-sition from one to the other may occur.

The second debate is about quantitative and qualitative methods of evaluation. Lincoln and Guba (1985) in their work on reliability (dependability) and validity in qualitative research argued for these to be interpreted in terms of the  X  X  X rustworthiness X  X  of the research. On reviewing the debate since then, Golafshani (2003) calls initions can include trustworthiness, rigor, and quality.

Work on related applications, to the one we describe in this paper, can typically be found in the field of context-aware computing applications. For an overview, see Dey, Kortuem, Morse, and Schmidt (2001) in a special issue on Situated Interaction and Context-aware computing. 3.1. Our previous work
At present, we use the more general user context model ( Myrhaug &amp; Go  X  ker, 2003 ) that has a wider range of aspects. It has been enriched and improved from our earlier work in context-aware computing ( Myrhaug, 2001 ) and also our work investigating context in a variety of information environments ( Go  X  ker, 1994, a concept, the user context model represents aspects of the user X  X  situation including social, task, personal, environmental, and spatio-temporal aspects. Individual user interests are regarded as part of personal context.
The model is used according to the sources of evidence that can be gathered for a specific application. Fig. 3 shows our model and its main components. The user context describes aspects of a situation seen from the user X  X  point of view.

It is a framework for capturing and using context information within and across application domains. The user context structure is designed to enable effective matching and retrieval of contexts within and between applications. Our methodology helps the evaluation of a system in context during design time, and the context model enables the use of context information to help the user find and retrieve relevant information in run time. 4. Methodology
This section describes the AmbieSense methodology for carrying out user studies in context. It enables iter-ative development of both the information and the information system in parallel. information-and system developers to develop and improve the quality of the information and the informa-tion system together with users. 2 4.1. Principles
There are two main principles in the AmbieSense methodology: 1. User studies in context  X  ensure a context match between the study and the application use. 2. Iterative development of system, the information, and the evaluation.

We will now consider further aspects of these. 1. User studies in context  X  ensure a context match between the study and the application use . In other words, to ensure that there is a good match between the study conducted and the application of the system in the situation or intended use. The guidelines for this principle are: 2. Iterative development of the system, the information, and the evaluation
The methodology is iterative and progressive in nature. It has been designed to meet the challenge of con-ducting studies in ambient and mobile information environments. In these environments, difficulties arise because the users X  information needs change as they encounter new situations. The relevance and usefulness of specific information varies from situation to situation. The methodology can be used to capture the rele-vance and usefulness of the information in specific situations with specific tasks at hand. On top of this chal-lenge of mobile information seeking, each individual user has individual interests and preferences for information. The individual interest and preferences for information affect the tasks that the users will nor-mally choose to do  X  i.e., user interests and preferences for information will always be a variable. 5. How the methodology was used
We had two sets of three user studies: one set in Seville city centre (outdoors) and one in Oslo Airport (indoors). This paper concentrates on Seville. These were the tourist studies because they followed tourists in the City, while in Oslo we were in the airport and focussed on travellers X  information needs.
The methodology was used throughout the project to improve both the information and the information system. Table 1 shows the overall picture of how the user studies gradually scaled up. The methodology helped the project team identify the information and system needs in context.

The first two experiments, in each study set, were more formative evaluations to help guide us on improving both the system and our experiments. The final experiments were summative to help conclude on the overall acceptability of the system and whether it is good enough in addition to meeting needs of external stake holders.

In addition to the user studies, we also conducted a large user survey. The need for this was identified at mid-point in the studies. It was conducted in parallel to the remaining studies, and had the purpose of gathering further empirical evidence for findings in the user studies and help build towards the summative evaluation. Some of the questions in the pre and post questionnaires were also included in the user survey.
For example, the question regarding the type of information gathered during travel, from the questionnaires, was included in the larger user survey. Table 2 shows the distribution of surveys that were conducted in addi-tion to the experiments. The survey questionnaires were handed out manually both in Seville city and Oslo
Airport to tourists/travellers and also on relevant web sites. These were the airport X  X  own web site and a travel guide publisher X  X  (Lonely Planet) site. We looked for differences in online and manual responses but found that there was less difference than expected. There was remarkable consistency across most areas between respondents in Seville, Oslo, and the Web. 5.1. Where the user studies took place in Seville
The three studies were conducted in the most tourist dense part of Seville city centre. The test area started at the gates of a famous castle (Alca  X  zar) and stretched to a small square (Plaza del Salvador). It was chosen because it contains many diverse points of interests such as: shops, hotels, monuments, bars, restaurants, meeting places, attractions, historical buildings etc., catering to a large variety of interests users might have.
Additionally, all this is in a relatively small and dense space, which has been tailored for pedestrians and tour-ists  X  an aspect that sets this area apart from other possible ones, making it more suitable for user-centred evaluation (see Fig. 4 ).

Tags were mounted at a variety of places in the centre and a walk-about route involving passing through several information zones 4 was identified. The route was designed based on observing popular tourist paths and to link up a series of plausible information needs that might occur during a walk around the city centre.
This was done in conjunction with tourist expert advice. Each wireless tag had at least one main attraction or potentially interesting places (points of interest) nearby it.

Users entering an information zone can have access to certain kinds of content. It is also possible, for some items to pop-up on the user X  X  mobile device when encountering such zones. 5.2. The content
Fig. 5 shows one version of the system. The figure shows a search statement being entered in a search box, and the corresponding list of retrieved content items. The user can subsequently click on any and see the full information item.
 The underlying content collection comprises both general travel guide and local tourist information for Seville. The general travel guide was an appropriate extract provided by Lonely Planet Publications, for
Seville  X  covering places to see, things to do, places to eat, stay and so on. The local content was provided by Sevilla Global, which is owned by the City Council of Seville. It also covered historical sites, and had further information on places to eat and shop. Both data sets are in XML, and they were the basis for creating the indexes.
 6. Results of user study: Seville city centre I 6.1. Objectives
Most of the observers were new to conducting user studies. Hence, apart from learning how to evaluate in context, an equally important objective was to train the observers to conduct the user studies and experience what would be difficult to do and what would be easier to do. The purpose was to get an idea of how long the experiments took in reality and to gain an understanding of how our evaluation measures were working out. 6.2. Overall description of the study
There were five participants in the first user study in Seville. These were local people employed by the Seville city council and unaware of the project. They had experience with mobile phones. In this way we could rely on the goodwill of the participants with respect to timescales or surprises. This reduced the risk of the first five participants not completing the study. The situations for system use were outdoors in Seville city centre, in the pedestrian area between the Cathedral and the Ayuntamiento City Council building. Each of the individual user studies started and ended in a local hotel reception. The user tasks were to search on the PDA whilst walking in the pedestrian area. There were 11 tasks per participant. In this study, we controlled the tasks but aimed for these to be as realistic as possible for the users X  situations. We were influenced by Borlund and Ingwersen X  X  (1997) work on  X  X imulated work task situations X .

The  X  X  X agic number X 5 X  X  often used in  X  X  X sability tests X  X  comes from discussions in the 1990s in usability engi-neering on cost-effective studies and the number of participants required for a maximum cost-benefit ratio ( Nielsen, 1994 ). There is a continued debate on the applicability of this number and when it may be appro-priate. We considered it a plausible starting point for gathering information about the system, its information content, the information needs of people using it, and aspects to bear in mind for future studies. Thus, in addi-tion to the number of participants, the number of information seeking tasks and total relevance judgements obtained is also important to consider. Also note that we have later scaled up in our studies for further con-fidence on our conclusions.
 Information appeared on the PDA screen when the participants were nearby each of the five wireless tags.
An observer followed the participant and asked questions about the relevance of the retrieved information, and described the next task to the participant. The observer was responsible to log the user interaction with the system, and document the answers to the questions. Other observers followed the participant and the observer from a distance to learn how to conduct user studies. The results were documented whilst outdoor, with pen and paper in the situation.

The use of camera to record the participant turned out to be too difficult. Also sending the participant out in the street alone with the PDA using automatic logging was also impractical. However, the conduct of pre and post questionnaire, together with an observer following the participant in the street to log the user inter-action with the system, the search, and the content items, turned out to be the smoothest and most effective way to evaluate in context. Retrospectively, this way to evaluate turned out to be the best practice for the
Seville studies. 6.3. Some results of pre and post questionnaires
The participants were in their twenties making them potentially familiar with mobile technology. This, however, varied in practice. All used mobile phones daily and rarely used PDAs. Familiarity with wireless technology was mixed: one was familiar with several types, and two did not know any. Fig. 6 shows what type of travel information was gathered before and while travelling. As expected sites/attractions, events, maps, are always important and is the type of information needed both before and during travel. Other travel informa-tion such as accommodation and transport are needed at different times  X  X efore and during travel, respec-tively. One interesting result is that shop information was not sought before travelling and even more unexpectedly not explicitly sought while travelling either  X  important considerations when deploying the wire-less tags.

For the types of information (see Fig. 7 ), the internet is the main source of travel information before travel, while during travel there is a complete change and a hotel reception becomes the primary source.
Participants were also asked to expand on the previous questions to find out how important each type of travel information is to them. The participants were given a five point scale with which to rate the different travel information, where 1 is unimportant and 5 is important. Fig. 8 shows the mean score for each type of information across all participants. These results support those from the previous questions showing that the highest rated type of information was sites, art and culture. The participants also considered transport, accommodation, nightlife, food and political stability as important. The types of travel information that were considered unimportant were research, health, nature, exchange rate and shopping. Although the category types are not exactly the same, the results coincide with the previous question with sites and events scoring high and shopping scoring low. 6.4. Some results for the general search tasks and pop-ups
The participants were given tasks while walking outdoor in the pedestrian area. The tasks were split into two types: General (G) and Specific (S). The S tasks were to test a specific feature such as the pop-up of a content item when the participant is within an information zone determined by a tag. The locations were a hotel, restaurant, and a variety of shops. The G tasks communicated, in short, to the users were: G1: You are hungry, want to eat and are looking for food / a restaurant (in the area of Calle Alemanes). G2: You need information on or about the Cathedral.
 G3: You need information on or about Plaza de San Francisco.
 G4: You need information on or about Plaza del Salvador.
 G5: You would like to find interesting places around Calle Francos.
 G6: You want to find some information about the Peyre Shopping centre, and shops within it.

The users were asked to provide user relevance judgments for the top two rank positions for the general tasks. We obtained relevance judgements as Relevant (R), Non-Relevant (N), and Partially Relevant (P) and the equivalent for Usefulness judgements. Also, we asked the users to re-rank the content items according to their preferred order. Results improved when content items that were considered partially relevant were included as relevant, an increase from 46% to 68% of items. All items (67%) were also considered to be useful.

The comments the participants provided during the study gave more information on how they made their judgements and what type of information they wanted. One common comment throughout the studies was that the information was relevant to their location but not to their situation (this was a plain version of the IR system with no user profile incorporated or system adaptivity). This explains the higher partially rel-evant rating. Note that at this point eliciting judgements with the more basic three level method (R, P, PN) rather than a graded scale was sufficient to get the overall idea of how the system was performing. Other feedback included that:
Shop information was not wanted during general queries where participants were looking to find informa-tion about sites. One participant commented that they would like a way to specify whether or not to include shop type information. One participant commented that instead of an overall description about the shop, he would have preferred specific product details from the shops.

Restaurant type information was generally considered more relevant than shop type information with a couple of users stating that they would have preferred restaurant items rather than shops items.
Time was also considered important, the restaurant information was considered more relevant at lunch-time. This again shows the importance of the user context on how they make their relevance judgements.
Other observations the participants made were on the amount and type of information the content items contained. The participants were generally happy with the amount of information provided by the content items. However, the amount of information considered sufficient was different for the different types of content items. Additionally, the scores for amount and structure of the information were lower in the general tasks than the specific tasks due to the lack of information on some points of interests. Some items only had short descriptions whereas the content for the specific tasks was generally more complete. 6.5. Improvements needed for the next user study The shift from PDA to mobile phones as the preferred equipment is necessary because the participants in
Seville wanted to access the information on personal mobile phones. This was later also supported with the findings of the larger survey.

Browse, pop-ups, and search tasks have to be supported to make the information experience seamless and similar to internet browsing and travel guide reading. More content items are needed. Some content items also need improvement too.
 Real tourists need to test the system, and more participants are needed.
 We need to see if the design of the information and system needs improvement.

The use of context information to personalise and rank the retrieved information, is still not tested, and needs to be developed.

In order to reduce the time taken in relevance judgements, either less re-ranking tasks should be given or a more focused assessment environment needs to be provided i.e., not completely suitable to do for all out-door tasks. 7. Results of user study: Seville city centre II 7.1. Objectives To evaluate the revised system in order to improve it. New components and content items need to be tested.
The search task needs controlled testing, and three different retrieval systems will be tested. We need to know much more about information needs and how the mobile search is perceived by travellers and tourists. Addi-tionally, we know little about the users X  willingness to provide personalisation and context information to the system. The pre and post questionnaire has been improved in terms of language and what questions to ask. 7.2. Overall description of the study
The 30 participants in the second user study were tourists staying in Seville together with two participants of the first user study. Fourteen wireless tags were installed. The tourists were recruited from a restaurant/bar next to the cathedral  X  a popular area for gathering/ eating. The participants of the first user study tried the system again to see if the information and the system had improved with the browse, search, and pop functionality. The pre and post questionnaire were conducted in a hotel reception. All participants did the controlled search tasks sitting in a sofa in the reception. Later they also walked outdoor in the pedestrian area, followed by one of our observers to test the browse, search and pop tasks outdoor. The tourists were all recruited from the same area where the user study was conducted. The search task involved specific information about Seville within the test site area. The pops occurred in the vicinity of the local shops, the Cathedral, and the tourist office. Each pop up item was a one page with an appropriate label, image, name of place, and description of the place. Each pop up described the place that the participant just encountered. The pops were all considered highly relevant. The observers wrote a test log on paper for each of the participants. The pre and post questionnaire were answered by the participants immediately before and after the outdoor use of the system.

The premise of this user study was also to compare three information retrieval components and compare the results. The first two systems, the Green system and the Blue systems were made by AmbieSense and the third Red system was a version of the Google web search engine for palm devices. The Red system was used to provide a baseline to compare to the results of the AmbieSense systems.

The shift from PDA to mobile phone was successful; a new browser had been developed, the mobile search, and the pop mechanism were promising, but needed further improvements. The observers had also become seasoned observers and the time spent per participant was reduced from 2 X 3 h to 1.5 h. We continued with the three-way judgements for relevance but a two-way (Y/N) usefulness judgement. Also, we allowed partic-ipants to express the re-ranked list in a flexible way, to save time. 7.3. Some results of pre and post questionnaires
The pre-questionnaire was used to gather demographic information about the user. All users who took part in this user test were within the 19 X 39 age group. As expected the mobile phone usage was high in this age group with 92.3% using mobile phones daily and the other 7.7% weekly. PDAs were used less, 30.7% used them at least once a week; while 61.5% have not used them so far. This result was not surprising, and con-firmed that it made sense to shift from PDA to mobile phone platform.

The users were then asked about their travel habits. The number of times they travelled per year was varied with one user travelling only once or none at all and two users travelling over 10 times per year. The median is 2 X 6 times per year.

Fig. 9 shows the type of travel information our users gather before and during travel. As can be seen in the figure, the type of information users gather before travel and during travel changes. Important types of infor-mation before travel are accommodation, sites and attractions and maps. During travel, restaurant informa-difference in the values between before and after in restaurants, accommodation, events and shopping.
The next question asked looked at where users gathered their travel information, Fig. 10 . The main infor-mation source before travel is the internet, followed by word of mouth. The main sources of travel informa-tion, during travel are tourist information, brochures and hotel reception. The number of users, who use the internet as an information source, drops dramatically from 100% before travel down to 22% during travel.
This is surprising as internet is available nearly everywhere and the users are used to using this method for retrieving information. Most of the information sources that rank highly, during travel, are items that are on hand i.e., brochures they pass or information from hotel reception. This suggests that the users want con-venient methods of finding travel information while travelling.

The final question in the post-questionnaire was to find out about the users X  views on providing contextual information. In order to provide personalisation and context enhanced results for the user in the AmbieSense system the user could provide some personal information. Fig. 11 shows the results of this question.
Most of the values are lower than expected with only two people willing to provide their name and three people willing to provide their address. More people are willing to provide information such as age group. A significant number are willing to provide information on hobbies and interests. Hobbies and interests will be useful for adding context to search. Also with more explanation of what the information would be used for, the results might improve.

The results of the pre and post questionnaires underpin the findings of the questionnaire for Seville test I, as to what type of travel information is important to a user. Sites and attractions are always important, while restaurants are important during travel and the opposite is true of accommodation  X  at that stage. The shop-ping category showed an improvement in this test i.e., important during travel, which is more inline with initial predictions. The results also showed that the type of information currently included in the travel application such as bars and restaurants, accommodation, sites and attractions, events, hotels and maps are the type of information that users want from a travel application. 7.4. Some results for the information retrieval tasks
The task part of the experiment was used to compare the three search systems. The search tasks were con-ducted indoors, in the hotel reception, in order to control variables and allow for a large amount of tasks to be completed by the user. The experiment consisted of three tasks for the user; each task was completed three times  X  once for each system. The order of the tasks and order the systems were rotated, to avoid creating any biases. The three tasks can be summarised as follows: Task 1 : A search on the Cathedral.
 Task 2 : A search on Alcazar.
 Task 3 : A search on information on Plaza de San Francisco.

For each task the user gave a query written on paper. This was then verbatim typed into the three systems by the observer and the results were displayed on the emulator. The emulator was used in this user test to reduce the cognitive load on the user. All the user had to concentrate on was evaluating the results without any distractions. It also allowed the evaluator more control over the experiment, making sure the queries were consistent over the three systems and it allowed both the evaluator and the users to see the results displayed, at the same time.

The observer tried to elicit further comments as appropriate to understand the users X  reasoning. Afterwards the user was asked to re-order the set of results in their preferred order.

It is important to point out some key differences between the systems. The content of the Red system was different from the Green and Blue systems: (i) the size of the content collection was different, (ii) the number of items on each point was different i.e., the web could have thousands of pages on Alcazar where as the Ambie-
Sense system had only two at that time, (iii) the device was different, P900 Sony Ericsson mobile phone (Emu-lator) was used for the AmbieSense systems and a Compaq handheld computer (Emulator and real) was used for the Red results, and (iv) the interface screens were different. The algorithms of the Green and Blue systems are not compared with the Red systems; so the differences in content and collection size are not important. It is the impact these system differences have on the retrieved results that is important. Both systems are similar in that they provide a search facility on wireless devices.
The experiment compares two different methods of information retrieval in a mobile situation. The Red system used WLAN to search the web. The AmbieSense systems communicate via Bluetooth with wireless tags and hold a smaller amount of context-specific content. With these goals in mind the three search systems were treated as much as possible as black boxes to see which system, regardless of method or algorithm, provided the most relevant and useful results to the user. 7.4.1. The blue and green system Two AmbieSense travel applications were used in the user test; this was so that variations in the Ambie-
Sense search algorithms could be compared against each other. The Blue system was the most basic system and had limited context knowledge i.e., location, where as the Green system X  X  algorithm used context infor-mation to extend the user X  X  query. The algorithm derived for the latter system was based on knowledge gath-ered in the first Seville test. Both Green and Blue systems had the same interface and content base (343 content items from our content providers Sevilla Global and Lonely Planet) allowing both algorithms to be compared fairly against each other. Fig. 12 , shows screen shots of the Blue and Green systems interfaces and two exam-ple content items. Sometimes, two different sources of information provide content on the same place e.g., both Lonely Planet and Sevilla City Council having content items on Alcazar. Fig. 13 depicts the Red system interface.
 7.4.2. Red system
Google is one of the most widely used search engines used on the Web. Google X  X  palm version, ( www.red. com/palm ), exemplifies the type of search facility currently available to tourists who have handheld wireless devices. A screen shot of the Red interface and results are shown in Fig. 13 . 7.4.3. Cathedral, alcazar and plaza San Francisco tasks
Task one was the Cathedral task i.e., to find information on the Cathedral. Users were asked to find infor-mation about the Cathedral that would interest them. The reason for specifically asking what would interest the user rather than just searching for Cathedral or Cathedral, was to try to get the user to formulate a more purposeful query themselves. The users wrote the query on paper. The Cathedral was located 100 meters from the user experiments. The query was then passed to the evaluator who entered the search on the three systems in exactly the same way keeping the case and spelling the way the user wrote down or stated. This allowed the user to concentrate on the judgments rather than the application interface. An emulator on the pc was used to concentrate solely on the content items and judgments.

The queries entered for the Cathedral query were mostly similar  X  X  X athedral Sevilla X  X ,  X  X  X athedral Seville X  X ,  X  X  X chedule Giralda X  X  or  X  X  X athedral X  X .

Fig. 14 shows the overall results over all the tasks. The Green system which uses more context and content information shows a slight improvement over the Blue AmbieSense system which only uses simple context information, although the result is not significant. The Red system performed the worst out of the three sys-tems. There is a significant difference between the Green and Red relevance results, with a p -value of 50.012 and a significance value of .000, which shows that there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the systems perform the same. 7.5. Improvements needed for the next user study To test various information retrieval methods.
 Even more content items would be better to address gaps.
 A larger scale user study, approximately 70 participants.

To identify more precisely which type of information, which type of equipment, which kind of information services that travellers and tourists need the most.
 The participant recruitment process was not as effective and could be smoother and more flexible. We should try if a 1 X 5 graded scale for relevance judgements would give more feedback.

We also need more feedback on personalisation. 8. Results of user study: Seville city centre III 8.1. Objectives
We need to scale up the number of participants in the third and final user study, and to provide more con-tent in the system. The browse and pop-up functions perform rather well, however we need to further explore the information retrieval task, and the user X  X  willingness to provide context information for personalisation purposes. We also need to find out the three most important things for personalisation. We will complete the large survey in parallel with this last study. 8.2. Overall description of the study
We surpassed the goal of 70 participants by achieving 102 participants, each with approximately 1.5 hours of experiment. There was a pre and post questionnaire, and the user tasks were as before: search, browse, and pop. The search task happened both indoor in the hotel reception sitting in a sofa, and outdoor while walking.
The search task involved further benchmarking of IR methods, and the results were very successful and prom-ising for mobile search purposes. All the pop up items from the wireless tags were for the same place as the wireless tags were mounted. The observer followed the participant outdoor for the browse and pop tasks, and logs were documented during the walk. In parallel to the user study, the observers also conducted a user sur-vey outside the Cathedral and other places in the city centre with tourists having time available to spend 20 min to answer a survey, the observer waited around until the questionnaire was completed by the tourists and collected it. The participants were recruited from three of our information stands in the city centre that was manned all day. Some of the participants additionally also volunteered to do the user survey.
There were six categories of content: eat, sleep, see, info, night and shop. The eat category included content on restaurants, cafes and bars. The sleep category included hotels, hostels and B&amp;B type content. The see cat-egory included sights and attractions such as the Cathedral and museums. The info category included tourist information, classes and hospital type information (result of feedback from previous study). The night cate-gory was mixed with some bars and nightclubs and also some shows or night time events. The shop category contained information on shops.
 8.3. The information retrieval task
Two types of search tasks were given to the users. The user was given the task descriptions below and then asked to create a query. A long description was given so that the users had to formulate their own query and not rely too much on the wording provided. They were asked for graded relevance judgements, see Kekalainen and Jarvelin (2002) .

See Task:  X  X  X ou are in the tourist centre of Seville. Seville has a fascinating inner city with many places to see such as a Cathedral, fortress/palace (Alca  X  zar), inner gardens, churches, squares, and so on. Hopefully you are interested in seeing or finding out more information about one of these places nearby. Make a search that would describe your need for further information on any of these places to see X  X .

Eat Task:  X  X  X ou are in the tourist centre of Seville. There are narrow streets, small squares, eating places, meeting points and so on. You are at such a place at the moment. You would like to find somewhere to eat.
You may wish to eat by yourself or with friends. Make a search so that you can find a suitable nearby place to eat X  X .
 The user performed two searches for each type of task, Eat and See. Two Eat category searches, one on the
Blue system then one on the Yellow system; then two See category searches, one on the Yellow system then one on the Blue system. The order of the systems and type of task was rotated to avoid bias. The search tasks were also performed at different locations, to make use of the context information provided by the tag. Four sites, two for each user, were used to perform search tasks: Hotel Dona Maria, Pub Flaherty, Ayuntamiento (Town hall) and the tourist office. A shorter test was also run which ran two queries for one of the tasks at one location. This allowed recruiting more users as often tourists were reluctant to give up too much of their time.
Before starting the test, the user was asked to fill in the preference page which was used to help create the user context. Location information, also part of user X  X  context, was also added via the tag for the Yellow+ system.
 There were three information retrieval components that were tested by the tourists in this study (Seville City
Centre III). These were named: Blue, Yellow and Yellow+, though users were unaware of this. All the infor-mation retrieval components were embedded in the same system and with the same content. All used the prob-abilistic model of information retrieval as the base for the retrieval algorithm and also used Spanish to English filter. The Spanish to English filter was used to filter out common Spanish word and replace them with the
English equivalent in user X  X  queries or in the content. As it was found in the first and second Seville user tests, users often entered Spanish words as queries, even when the system was in English.

The Blue system was the simplest system which used no context or personalisation information in the retrie-val algorithm. The Yellow system used some contextual information on the user which was gathered via the preferences the user entered on the preference page. The preferences allowed the user to enter information of the price range the users were interested in restaurants and hotels and also the type of restaurants the user liked. The Yellow+ system was identical to the Yellow system but it also added location (area) gathered from the tag. The users were unaware if there was any difference between the Yellow and Yellow+ systems and both were called Yellow to the user.

There were 110 queries entered by participants during the search tasks, 59 See and 51 Eat. A query was only counted the first time it was entered by a user and not the second time it was entered when testing the same query on the second search system. The length of queries entered in words was a median of 1 and a mean of 1.6 or a 5% trimmed mean of 1.38 words, which is more representative as there were two extremes of 10 and 11 words queries from one user. The length of a query in words was taken to be all words including stop words such as  X  X  X he X  X ,  X  X  X n X  X  and  X  X  X nd X  X .

The queries in Seville III test were different from the queries in the Seville II test. In June, a lot of users of three words per query. This shows that although we had tried to avoid bias by rotating the systems, once people knew they were entering the same query into two systems, one being AmbieSense, and the other non-
AmbieSense (Google on Palm), they adjusted their queries accordingly. One reason for the short queries, in this September user test, is that users did not feel the need to enter additional context information such as location. Another possible reason is that it is harder to enter queries on mobile devices or that users are used to writing shorter text in phones, for example in text messages.

In the Eat task the users X  queries were less specific and focused on type of place they wanted to go such as  X  X  X estaurant X  X ,  X  X  X ar X  X  or the type of food they wanted  X  X  X izza X  X ,  X  X  X asta X  X . Only one of two users mentioned a specific restaurant such as  X  X  X obles X  X  a popular tapas bar near the Cathedral. One of two users also indicated the price range they wanted. We noticed during the user test that query types appear to have an effect on the systems X  performances. 8.3.1. Returned content items 707 5 content items were returned by the search systems and judged by the users. Only the top three ranked results were judged for each query entered to a system, so the results in Fig. 15 refer only to these rank posi-tions. Out of these, 43.8% were considered relevant, 24.3% considered highly relevant, 16.1% marginally rel-evant and 15.7% of content items were not considered relevant, see Fig. 15 . This result is over the first three rank positions, on all systems and over both tasks. A rank position is the position the result appeared in the search result; the first content item returned is rank position 1, the second result is rank position 2 and so on.
Although these percentages do not us give us the individual perspective of how the system performed, i.e., if one user thought all the content items returned were not relevant they might have a bad impression of the system and vice versa, they do give an impression of how the system performed to the users in general. Overall, the results look very positive with the majority, 68%, of content items considered relevant or highly relevant by users.

Fig. 16 looks at how the relevance and usefulness ratings, of the users X  judgements on the content items, related to each other. The graph shows how 87% of the relevant content items are in the useful or highly useful section of the graph. The opposite was also true for items that were considered not relevant. Most are either not useful or only marginally useful. The usefulness and relevance judgements were very similar. This result suggests that the level of information in the content items is at the right level, as most of the items considered relevant to a user X  X  query also ranked high for usefulness.

The results shown in Figs. 15 and 16 have been general over all the AmbieSense search systems. A more detailed look at how each system performed on the two tasks separately was also analysed.
 As a note on the See task, users were asked to choose a query about sites and attractions around Seville.
The queries the users entered varied from specific sites such as Alcazar, Cathedral and Palacio del Lebrija to general queries about museums, churches or flamenco. Using tourists as our users gave us realistic queries; most of the queries were about specific places in Seville the users wanted to find out about. The users were also in a better position to judge the results with many of the users having been to some of the places. Some users noticed specific details; such as if a price was wrong in a content item or they would check the opening hours. The fact that the tourists were interested in the content and could use the information meant that both the queries and the judgements were more realistic.

Personalisation information in the AmbieSense travel guide was entered via the preferences page. The user was given a list of categories of restaurants based on cuisine served, for example, and asked to tick the ones they liked. When asked how important entering preferences were to the users, the results were mixed. Users (25%) felt it was very important, the majority at 35% felt it was slightly important, where 26% did not mind both ways, and the remaining 14% felt it was not important. This fits with what was observed during the test, a few users would check to see how preferences affected the results. However, some users did not appear to look for an effect from the preferences at all. This could be an issue for the interface, the fact that the connection between the information on the preference page and search results was not clearly identifiable. Fig. 17 shows the kind of information users were willing to provide for personalisation purposes.
 8.4. Summary conclusions on the final user study The final user study was summative.
 Participants (102) completed the test, one participant stopped half way.
 A user survey was conducted in parallel.
 A few user sessions were recorded with a live TV camera crew seeking to publicise the system and project.
The system is now commercialised. 9. Discussion
In this section we discuss the evaluation methodology and its guidelines. 1. User studies in context  X  to ensure a context match between the study and the application use 2. Iterative development of the system, the information, and the evaluation 10. Conclusions
The evaluation of a mobile information system for tourists has been presented. The evaluation followed our methodology for evaluating in context. Three user studies have been presented to illustrate the overall evalu-ation progress. The user studies were gradually scaled up, and both information and the information system itself were iteratively and progressively improved between the user studies.

We were able to use the evaluation methodology successfully on two sets of three user studies  X  respectively in Seville city centre and in Oslo airport. The number of participants scaled up from 5 to 102 in Seville, and from 5 to 75 in Oslo tests. The amount of time spent per participant was also reduced between the user studies.
Two hundred and twenty of the total 238 participants were real travellers and tourists, that were at the tour-istic location driven by their own interests and needs.

We obtained relevance judgements as Relevant (R), Non-Relevant (N), and Partially Relevant (P) in the first two studies. The graded relevance judgement approach ( Kekalainen &amp; Jarvelin, 2002 ) was considered and used as part of and incremental progression in the third study.

We stress the importance of obtaining relevance judgements at the situation the user is in and not retrospec-tively or whilst in another situation. In mobile information access this is particularly challenging. The user is a traveller/tourist and time is of the essence. Asking for  X  X elevant X  or  X  X ot relevant X  and even asking about the  X  X sefulness X  seemed an acceptable question load per task. However, extending this to include  X  X artially rele-vant X  was in fact at times a stretch. Hence, the importance of simplicity in the initial studies. The extra gran-ularity of information on precision values based on the graded scale approach is not necessary at each stage of development. Hence, it should be weighed up carefully against the complication in assessing perceived by the participants.

We believe the overall approach would be useful to consider when developing information systems that also scale up. The progressive and iterative methodology has been a core part of enabling this. This was a rather large project and system. We, therefore assume that the methodology would also work for smaller projects. A commercial version of the system also exists.
