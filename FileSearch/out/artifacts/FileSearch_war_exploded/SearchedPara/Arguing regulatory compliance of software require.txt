 1. Introduction ensure compliance of their reporting and risk management procedures with the Sarbanes is a costly proposition and not dealing with it is not an option.

We are interested in addressing the compliance problem at the requirements level. This means asking the question requirements R to a compliant variation R  X  .

A key issue for the requirements compliance problem concerns the form of evidence provided that indeed a requirements

In our work, we lower the bar by adopting a conceptual modeling approach whereby laws and requirements are captured through conceptual models. These models capture logical relationships among law fragments and requirements, such as established through automated proof, but rather through argumentation among the stakeholders who state positions, e.g., iteratively transform R=R(0) into revised requirements models R(1), stakeholders agree that a revised model R(N) indeed complies with L.

The contributions of the paper include an extension of the N X mos framework [4] for dealing with compliance. With this extension, we are able to both detect compliance and pinpoint which requirements don't comply and need to be revised. To accomplish this, we integrate into N X mos the modeling and analytical elements of an argumentation framework. Through a the input model that is compliant with the law.

Requirements engineering frameworks are grounded on the elicitation and analysis of stakeholder needs. i* [6] is an agent-oriented modeling framework for requirements, where stakeholders are modeled as actors, and goals represent their respective requirements. In addition, actors are interrelated through social relationships, such as models goals within an actor, and the tasks by which these can be fulfilled. compliance. When an actor of the domain is recognized to be a subject of law (e.g., when actors referred to as  X  Doctor  X  in a certain law), the actor is placed in an an actor actually complying with a given normative proposition, the language of law, the N X mos framework introduces a dominance

So how do we define compliance in terms of argumentation? Anytime a regulation applies, we can loosely say that its non-conformity, we need to be able to identify which part of the system does not comply and needs to be amended. We have irregularity relations in the model ( affect / violate ) has to be established. 4.

In the next sections we introduce in detail the five steps of the compliance process and how argumentation supports amendments. We exemplify the proposed process by means of a running example regarding HIPAA. and steps, is provided in Fig. 3 . 4.1. Step 1. Embodiment that legal subject are added in the actor boundary.

Their argumentation framework is based on the concept of  X  argumentation framework to show how a system meets its security requirements.

Moreover, the ACE argumentation framework we use [8], was specifically designed for discussions in requirement engineering. Our work improves these approaches as we requirement model. 7. Conclusions
The present work proposes a goal-oriented, norm-driven requirements modeling framework for modeling law, requirements adopted to establish compliance. Evidence and proof of compliance are provided by the arguments made by the stakeholders discussing models of requirements and law. The systematic process we propose, allows us to amend an initial requirements amounts to evaluating its acceptability.

In other words, some argumentation points apply to multiple normative propositions, but, of course, they need only be discussed once.

Future work will therefore address the issue of law evolution, where we need to enrich our framework to accommodate the co-evolution of laws and requirements for a given software system.
