 Data Mining is the process of automatic discovery of novel and understandable models and patterns from large amounts of data. Bioinformatics is the science of storing, analyzing, and utilizing information from biological data such as se-quences, molecules, gene expressions, and pathways. Devel-opment of novel data mining methods will play a fundamen-tal role in understanding these rapidly expanding sources of biological data. The extensive databases of biological infor-mation create both challenges and opportunities for devel-oping novel data mining methods.
 The 6th BIOKDD Workshop was held on August 20th, 2006, Philadelphia, PA, USA, in conjunction with the 12th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The goal of the workshop was to encour-age KDD researchers to take on the numerous challenges that Bioinformatics offers. The BIOKDD workshops have been held annually in conjunction with the ACM SIGKDD Conferences, since 2001. Additional information about the workshop can be obtained online at: http://www.cs.rpi. edu/  X  zaki/BIOKDD06.
 Out of the 18 submissions, 6 were selected for presentation at the workshop. An overview of each paper is given below. In their paper, Signal Transduction Model Based Functional Module Detection Algorithm for Protein-Protein Interaction Networks , Woochang Hwang, Young-Rae Cho, Aidong Zhang and Murali Ramanathan, describe the unexpected proper-ties of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and their use in a clustering method to detect biologically rele-vant functional modules. They propose a new method called STM (signal transduction model) to detect the PPI modules, and compare it with previous approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering large and arbitrary shaped clus-ters.
 In Protein Folding Trajectories: Summarization, Event De-tection and Consensus Partial Folding Pathway Identifica-tion , Hui Yang, Srinivasan Parthasarathy and Duygu Ucar, describe a method to mine protein folding molecular dynam-ics simulations datasets. They describe a spatio-temporal association discovery approach to mine protein folding tra-jectories, to identify critical events and common pathways. In the paper titled Automatic Layout and Visualization of Biclusters , Gregory A. Grothaus, Adeel Mufti and T. M. Murali, present a novel method to display biclusters mined from gene expression data. The approach allows querying and visual exploration of the clusters/sub-matrices. The software is also available as open-source.
 In ExMotif: Efficient Structured Motif Extraction , Yongqiang Zhang and Mohammed J. Zaki, describe a new algorithm called ExMotif to extract frequent motifs from DNA se-quences. The method can mine structured motifs and pro-files which have variable gaps between different elements. The demonstrate the efficiency of the method compared to state-of-the-art methods, and also demonstrate an applica-tion in mining composite transcription factor binding sites. In the paper Motif Refinement using Hybrid Expectation Maximization based Neighborhood Profile Search , Chandan K. Reddy, Yao-Chung Weng and Hsiao-Dong Chiang, show how one can refine the profile motifs discovered via Expec-tation Maximization/Gibbs Sampling based methods. They search the neighborhood regions of the initial alignments to obtain locally optimal solutions, which improve the infor-mation content of the discovered profiles.
 In Protein Classification using Summaries of Profile-Based Frequency Matrices , Keith Marsolo and Srinivasan Partha-sarathy, describe a new method for classifying protein se-quences by creating a wavelet-based summary of the fre-quency scores obtained via PSI-BLAST. They demonstrate that the new method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for remote homology detection and fold recogni-tion. The approach can also be used for indexing protein sequences.
 There were two invited talks at the workshop. David Roos gave a talk on Designing and Mining Pathogen Genome Databases: Targets for Drugs, Vaccines and Diagnostics . David highlighted the development of new algorithms for comparative genomic analysis, and databases enabling the integration and mining of diverse large-scale post-genomics datasets, especially in the context of a variety of pathogen genome databases his team has developed. Sridhar Hannen-halli gave a talk on Deciphering Gene Regulatory Networks by in silico Approaches . Sridhar outlined various compu-tational problems pertaining to transcriptional regulation, namely, (1) representation and identification of transcription factor binding sites, (2) PolII promoter prediction, (3) Pre-dicting interaction among transcription factors, (4) Tran-scriptional modeling, i.e. identifying arrangements of TFs that co-regulate a set of transcripts.
