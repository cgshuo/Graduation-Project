 Motivation: learning GGMs on spatial datasets, e.g.: silhouettes, motion trajectories, 2D and 3D images, with spatial coherence of the dependence/independence relationships (local constancy) Results: an l maximum likelihood estimation, and an efficient algorithm that decomposes the original optimization problem into a sequence of non-smooth piecewise quadratic problems with closed form solutions
