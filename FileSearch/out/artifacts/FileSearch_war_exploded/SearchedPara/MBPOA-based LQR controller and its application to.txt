 1. Introduction modern control theory. Previous works have shown that LQR
Algorithm (MBPOA) is proposed and veri fi ed on the double-and implement the desired LQR ef fi ciently and easily.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Pareto-based MBPOA algorithm. The proposed lum system and the control performance is analyzed and dis-cussed. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5 . 2. Pareto-based Multi-objective Binary Probability
