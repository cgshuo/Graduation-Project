 With the rapid development of online information retrieval systems, especially search engines on the Internet, more and more information is becoming readily accessible. Meanwhile, it also poses a challenge to appropriate management and protection against misuse and intrusion. Generally speaking, intrusion is per-formed by unauthorized people who are outside an organization. Misuse, on the other hand, refers to the situation that an authorized user tries to misuse the authorization to retrieve documents th at is considered  X  X ff-topic X  to his prede-fined area of interest and thus should not be viewed by him. Such misuse is the second most prevalent form of computer crime after viruses, according to the recent government studies [1].

The problem of off-topic detection is often addressed by exploiting the user profile. Depending on the particular applications, the profile defines his legiti-mate or illegitimate scope of interest. For instance, for the children browsing the Internet at home, they should be allowed to view any webpages except those inappropriate such as violent or porn. The profile in this case consists of those off-topic webpages. By comparing the test documents with the profile, the pri-mary goal is to detect if there is any off-topic document in the test set. Existing methods usually employ a Top k Nearest Neighbors (TKNN) approach by re-garding the off-topic documents in the profile as seeds and seeking their top k nearest neighbors in the test set as suspects. This is based on the common as-sumption that nearby documents are from the same class. However, due to the inherent sparseness of high-dimensional space, a document and its nearest neigh-bors may not belong to the same class. To that end, in this paper, we develop a HYperclique Pattern based Off-topic D etection (HYPOD) approach for select-ing which ones to label. Hyperclique patterns consider joint similarity among a set of objects instead of the traditional pairwise similarity. As a result, the objects from hypercliques are more reliable as prototypes for classifying their neighbors. Indeed, our experimental results on real world document data favor-ably demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique over the existing methods in terms of detection precisi on. Note that high precision is much more important than recall here, for a false access violati on accusation unfairly subjects the user to scrutiny. The detection system is exp ected to sort out several suspects that are highly likely to be off-topic. It is the human who is responsible to monitor the prediction and make a final decision.
 Overview. Section 2 reviews the related wor k. Section 3 introduces the TKNN approach, which is typical among the pairwise similarity based approaches. Then Section 4 presents our HYPOD approach that employs hyperclique patterns for prediction. Comparative results are reported in Section 5. Finally, we draw conclusions in Section 6. Previous work on detection can be divided into intrusion detection and off-topic detection. Some work on intrusion det ection has been in the area of pattern matching [2] and text (programs) clustering [3]. Off-topic detection techniques generally fall in system based and content based approaches. System based ap-proaches rely on system characteristics, such as file name, size and storage loca-tion, to detect a deviation from normal be havior [4]. Predetermining the mapping of documents to allowable users, however, is highly difficult in large and dynamic document collections. In contrast, content-based approaches check if the content being accessed matches a valid scope of interest, which is usually defined by a user profile of on-topic content. Along this line, information retrieval techniques have been extensively employed, e.g., clust ering query results [ 5], relevance feed-back [6] and fusion of warnings from individual methods [7].

Off-topic detection is also r elated to outlier detectio n, which has also been ex-plored in the data mining community [8]. Compared to the totally unsupervised techniques for outlier detection, profile based methods for off-topic detection are semi-supervised in that the class labels of documents in the profile are available for the construction of the prediction model. Both classes of methods try to as-sign an off-topic (outlier) degree to every test object. In contrast, here our goal is to detect the presence of off-topic documents in the test set. Therefore, the predicted set of off-topic content shoul d possess a high precision while recall is relatively less important. In this section, we briefly review the TKNN approach, which is commonly used as a principled method in outlier and off-topic detection [9,7]. It is outlined in Fig. 1 and explained in detail below.

For a system monitoring many users, the allocated space for each user profile is small. We assume that the profile is represented by O = { o 1 , ..., o m } ,asetof m seed off-topic documents, which are ei ther assigned or learned over a period of use, e.g., by random sampling, clustering the whole document set or query results. For each test document d i  X  D ,TKNNfirstassignsittotheseed o i  X  O with which it shares the largest similarity (line 1-4). Regarding this similarity also as the similarity to the whole profile, TKNN finally selects the top k documents d with highest similarity to O , which is shown in line 5 where  X  denotes set cardinality. TKNN is simple and easy to implement. It assigns different predictive power to different seeds and can avoid pr ediction errors when some seeds are noise. On the other hand, TKNN has several weaknesses. The similarity to the seed set is still based on pairwise similarity. Besides, since the final selection of top k nearest neighbors is on a global sca le, it is possible that a seed from a sparse cluster never gets used in prediction. In this paper, we employ hyperclique patterns to find nearest neighbors to the seed set. This section first briefly descr ibe the concept of hyperclique patterns, then presents our HYPOD approach for off-topic detection.
 4.1 Hyperclique Patterns Let I = { i 1 ,i 2 , ..., i n } be a set of distinct item s. Each transaction T in database D is a subset of I .Wecall X  X  I an itemset. The support of X , denoted by supp ( X ), is the fraction of transactions containing X .If supp ( X )isnolessthan a user-specified threshold, X is called a frequent itemset. The confidence of asso-ciation rule X 1  X  X 2 is defined as conf ( X 1  X  X 2 )= supp ( X 1  X  X 2 ) /supp ( X 1 ). It estimates the likelihood that the presence of an itemset X 1 implies the pres-ence of the other itemset X 2 in the same transaction.

Because frequent itemsets only consider support, they may include items with very different support values. To measure the overall affinity among items within an itemset, the h-confidence was proposed in [10]. Formally, the h-confidence of an Given a set of items I and a minimum h-confidence threshold h c ,anitemset P  X  I is a hyperclique pattern if and only if hconf ( P )  X  h c . A hyperclique pattern P can be interpreted as that the presence of any item i  X  P in a transaction implies the presence of all other items P  X  X  i } in the same transaction with probability at least h c . A hyperclique pattern is a maximal hyperclique pattern if no superset of this pattern is a hyperclique pattern. With cosine as similarity measure and with documents represented by binary vector s indicating which words occur, it is easy to show that the similarity between any two documents in a hyperclique is lower bounded by the hyperclique X  X  h-confidence. 4.2 The HYPOD Approach In the HYPOD approach, inst ead of selecting the top k nearest neighbors to the seed set on a global scale, the main idea is to label only the documents in the hypercliques that contain the seed documents. As shown in line 2 of Fig. 2, we first mine the maximal hyperclique patterns DP from the document set D  X  O that contain at least one seed document. This is implemented on top of an efficient algorithm [11] for mining all maximal hyperclique patterns. With similarity between O and all test documents initialized to 0, we only update the similarity for the test documents that appear in DP . There are two cases that deserve special attention. First, as show n in line 5, if several seeds appear in the same pattern dp ,then sim dp ( O, d ), the similarity between O and d  X  dp w.r.t. dp , is the maximal similarity value with those seeds. Second, as shown in line 6, if a test document appears in several patterns, the final sim ( O, d ) is the maximal similarity value with those patterns. Finally, we select the top k test documents with largest similarity with O .

The HYPOD approach has several advantages. First, it only predicts documents strongly connected to the seeds, which is also shared by the TKNN approach. Sec-ond, unlike TKNN, it considers the similarity among groups of documents instead of just pairs of documents. Thus it is able to label test documents in the sparse clus-ters where TKNN might fail. Fig. 3 illustrates such an example, where o 1 and o 2 are seed documents, d 1 -d 5 are test documents with d 1 -d 4 truly off-topic but d 5 on-topic. Their pairwise similarities are indicated as the corresponding edge weights. If we set k = 3, TKNN would only label documents from the dense cluster. To label d 3 and d 4 fromthesparsecluster,wehavetoincrease k . However, in terms of pairwise similarity alone, they can app ear in the final prediction set only after d 5 appears in it. In contrast, by setting the proper threshold, HYPOD can find two documents with o 1 and o 2 respectively. In this section, we first introduce the real world document datasets used in our experiments and then illustrate the purity of hyperclique patterns. Finally we report comparative results on these datasets.
 5.1 Hyperclique Patterns in the Document Datasets In our experiments, we used six datase ts them from different sources to ensure diversity. Similar to outlier detection [12] that treats rare class objects as outliers, we divide each dataset into on-topic and off-topic, where off-topic includes those classes whose size is less than half of average class size. Some characteristics of these datasets are shown in Table 1, where the 6th and 7th rows give the number of classes used as off-topic and thei r total fraction, respectively. For all datasets, we used a stoplist to remove common words, stemmed the remaining words using Porter X  X  suffix-stripping algorithm and removed those words with extreme low document frequencies. The d atasets are given in the transactional form and cosine is used as the pairwise similarity measure.

By considering group similarity instead of pairwise similarity, the discovered documents in the same hyperclique tend to belong to the same class. Now we demonstrate such purity. By regarding words as transactions and documents as items, Fig. 4(a) illustrates the average entropy of the document hypercliques from K1. We can see that as the minimum h-confidence threshold increases, the entropy of hyperclique patterns decreases dramatically, especially at low support values. This indicates that hyperclique patterns include objects from the same class above certain h-confidence levels. Besides, in high dimensional datasets like documents, two objects can often be nearest neighbors without belonging to the same class. The last 2nd row in Table 1 shows the percent of documents whose nearest neighbor is from the same class, which is clearly below 1 for all datasets. In contrast, taking advantage of the hyperclique purity, we can use only documents in the hypercliques to label their nearest neighbors. As indicated in the last row of Table 1, the corresponding fractions of correct prediction increase for all datasets, though to a varying degree. Of course this fraction usually depends on the specific thresholds used and Fig. 4(b) shows details for K1. 5.2 Comparative Results Given the condition that the profile for each user is quite limited, it can only contain a very small amount of off-topic documents. To simulate this condition, we randomly choose m off-topic documents as the profile, with m =2 , 5 , 10. Treating the rest of documents as the test set, we apply both TPKNN and HYPOD to predict k =2 m test documents. The average results of 10 runs are illustrated in Fig. 5(a). One can see that HYPOD yields better precision than TKNN. Fixing m = 5, we also evaluate them by varying k =5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the average precision of 10 runs generally decreases as k increases, since we need to use seeds to p redict more neighbors farther away. Nevertheless, HYPOD still gives better results than TPKNN. In this paper, we proposed a HYperclique Pattern based Off-topic Detection (HYPOD) approach to detecting access to o ff-topic documents by exploiting user profiles. Conventional methods like TKNN are usually based on pairwise similarity alone. However, in the high dimensional space like documents, two objects can often be nearest neighbors without belonging to the same class. On the other hand, hyperclique patterns consider group similarity and thus items in them are more reliable as seeds for predicting other items in the same pattern. Our experimental results on real world datasets favorably confirmed the advantage of HYPOD in terms of detection precision.
