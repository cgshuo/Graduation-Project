 E-learning has a distinctly different purpose from other Web applications [13], which is particularly in self-learning through fluent Web material and collaborative learning with and multimedia content. They also employ new pedagogic strategies and different students X  assessment of the learning [19]. Therefore, the attitudes and perceptions which students hold toward their learning experiences become increasingly important [22]. 
The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) explored the intentional usage of new information technology [5] while the Extended TAM employed the same purpose but provided a more complete and clear explanation of the determinants of users X  online usage [12]. Besides perceived usefulness and ease of use, on-line multimedia learning material may create the feelings of being challenge and having fun within students, which are intrinsic motivations to obtaining education [18]. Therefore, the factor of perceived enjoyment played a key role in the Extended TAM due to the learning experience [7]. 
Another concern in the study is fact that the extended TAMs have used some different critical quality variables on Internet applications as their external variables [2, 12, 17], even though a consistent and complete summary on external variables in TAMs would make the model more comprehensible. The comprehensive measurements  X  Website Quality [2], which has long progressed from SERQUAL [17], and information system quality measurement [12]  X  may be suitable for external variables of the the importance of perceived enjoyment in Website access, this lack of identifiable relationships could be attributed to the characteristics of Website quality which study we not only validate the role played by perceived enjoyment through the examination of e-learning  X  but also develop a complete model, particularly from among the factors for e-learning system acceptance. 2.1 The Students X  Attitude Toward the E-Learning System Acceptance The TAM was a very simple but effective model to predict and explain user acceptance of information technology. It suggested that external variables would the model, two beliefs  X   X  X erceived usefulness X  and  X  X erceived ease to use X   X  were degree of one X  X  job performance that would be improved by a specific system. X  intrinsic motivation of perceived enjoyment is defined as  X  X ll enjoyment generated from participating in the computer-based activity itself, independent of any other predictable result of the activity X  [18, 21]. Since browsing behavior on Websites was spotlight in current empirical studies [10]. 2.2 Web-Site Quality for On-Line Course External variables in TAM played important roles in the process of understanding the relationship between internal beliefs, attitudes and intentions [5]. To evaluate the effectiveness of or students X  satisfaction with information technology products in particular learning contexts, researchers suggested that three other factors  X  the student X  X  background, pedagogic, and content presentation  X  should be considered perceived ease to use and perceived enjoyment [7]. 
Ample research states that Website quality influences users X  perception of effectiveness [11]. The factors that determine the quality of e-commerce Websites include information content, content reliability, Website attractiveness, navigation speed, security, and customer service [11]. Another body of research on Website quality did not originate from studies on the quality of information systems, but from PZB measurement (SERQUAL). SERQUAL contains five dimensions: physic, model of effectiveness on information systems [9]. 3.1 Framework and Hypotheses of Interaction Activated TAM on E-Learning The research framework was adjusted from previous TAM and added an extra belief, perceived enjoyment to accommodate the application of e-learning [7, 14], as shown in Figure 1. The adjusted measurement of Website quality consisted of system functionality, interface design, pedagogic and content design, and community as external variables [1, 2, 19]. Therefore it was hypothesized that: Interface Desi g n H1: The system functionality will positi vely influence perceived ease to use. H2: Interface design will positively influence perceived ease to use.
 H3: Pedagogic and content will positively influence perceived usefulness. H4: Pedagogic and content will positively influence perceived enjoyment.
 H5: Community will positively influence perceived ease of use. H6: Community will positively influence perceived enjoyment.
 H7: Perceived ease of use will positive ly influence perceived usefulness. H8: Perceived ease of use will po sitively influence attitude. H9: Perceived usefulness will po sitively influence attitude. H10: Perceived usefulness will positively influence intention of usage. H11: Attitude will positively influence intention of usage.
 H12: Perceived ease of use will positi vely influence perceived enjoyment. H13: Perceived enjoyment will positively influence attitude. H14: Perceived enjoyment will positively influence intention of usage. 3.2 Design of Questionnaire The operation definition of the extended TAM was an adjusted version of the models measured Website quality were based on Swan X  X  [19] suggestions and included system functionality [2, 12, 19], interface design [4, 19], pedagogic and content design [19], and community [2]. All items were measured using a seven-point Likert scale. 
The reliability and validity of the measurement were tested through confirmation factor analyses using the Structural Equation Model. The confirmatory factor analyses were used for validity tests. According to the LAMBCA value calculated by the validity (Table 1). The values of total extraction of variance were greater than 0.6 for each dimension (Table 1)  X  higher than the acceptable of level 0.5. This also indicated that the measurement was valid. Coefficients of internal consistency (Cronbach  X  ) these measurements are reliable. 4.1 Sample Analyses An online survey was conducted in a Taiwanese university. The subjects taking the valid sample was 451, 39% of which majored in business and 23.9% of which majored in social science. The majority were not new Internet users, as 72.5% reported having more than 3 years of online surfing experience. 4.2 Evaluation of the Model Results from all three fit indexes of the Structural Equation Model were good, indicating that the extended TAM model is applicable to e-learning. The indexes are listed as follows: 1. Absolute Fit Measures: Absolute fitness could be measured through coefficient of 
RMSEA. The acceptable value is said to be either smaller than 0.06 [8] or smaller then 0.08 [16]. The value of RMSEA in the study was 0.06. The absolute fitness could also be indicated by the value of SRMR, which should be smaller than 0.08 [8]. The value of RMSR in this study was 0.058. 2. Incremental Fit Measures: The common measurement is the value of CFI, which should be equal to or greater than 0.95 [3]. Other indicators are NFI or NNFI. Their values are always between 0 and 1. At the same time, the model cannot be considered as meeting the standards unle ss the value of NFI or NNFI is greater than 0.9 [8]. In this study, the value of CFI was 0.98, greater 0.95. Both the value of NNFI and NFI were 0.98, greater than 0.9. 3. Parsimonious Fit Measures: The number of estimates that fulfill a specific level of appropriateness for the model. The model was considered good if the value of PGFI was greater than 0.5 [15]. The value of PGFI in this study was 0.7. 
Interface Desi g n 4.3 Results of the Model In Fig. 2, coefficients of the paths are demonstrated by the arrows, with t-values listed significant level of 0.05, indicating that all null hypotheses were rejected. For example, for the Hypothesis 1 , the c oefficient of path =0.16 while t-value=2.51, implying that students who consider the e-learning system as more quickly accessible and more reliable will perceive the system as easier to use. The other hypotheses can also be proven according to their co efficients of path and t-values. 5.1 Perceived Usefulness, Ease to Use, and Enjoyment on TAM in E-Learning understanding students X  acceptance of e-learning. The variable  X  X erceived enjoyment X  of an e-learning course. By using Squared Multiple Correlations for Structural Equations, the model could explain 84% variance of attitude and 83% variance of acceptance of e-learning than ease to use and enjoyment (Table 2). 5.2 Importance of Web Qualities This research illustrated the key factors of Web quality from students X  point of views-the importance of online content and community. The pedagogic and content online usage was  X  X ommunity, X  with a regression coefficient of 0.26 and 0.24. Online interactions among class members, estab lish a convenient communication channel for sharing learning experiences. 5.3 Contribution and Further Study Previous studies, whether they concentrated on extended TAM or Web quality, focused on the application of online transactions or services. The extended model of e-learning developed in this study provides a model which is simple, easy to understand, and able to effectively predict students X  attitudes and levels of acceptance. It not only combines the factor of perceived enjoyment, but also synthesizes and acceptance of e-learning. 
The attitude and acceptance of Websites may not be the same in other Web-technology applications due to their different purposes. Even though the main purpose TAM is acceptable because the behavior of online learning is more voluntary and controllable from the user X  X  perspective. Fu rther studies are needed to investigate how other applications, such as online gaming where the main motive behind Internet usage is for recreational purposes.
