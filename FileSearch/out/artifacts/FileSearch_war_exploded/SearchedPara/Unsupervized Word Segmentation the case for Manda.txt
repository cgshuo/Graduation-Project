 The Chinese script has no explicit  X  X ord X  bound-aries. Therefore, tokenization itself, although the very first step of many text processing systems, is a challenging task. Supervized segmentation sys-tems exist but rely on manually segmented corpora, which are often specific to a genre or a domain and use many different segmentation guidelines. In order to deal with a larger variety of genres and domains, or to tackle more theoretic questions about linguistic units, unsupervized segmentation is still an impor-tant issue. After a short review of the corresponding literature in Section 2, we discuss the challenging is-sue of evaluating unsupervized word segmentation systems in Section 3. Section 4 and Section 5 present the core of our system. Finally, in Section 6, we de-tail and discuss our results. Unsupervized word segmentation systems tend to make use of three different types of information: the cohesion of the resulting units (e.g., Mutual Infor-mation, as in (Sproat and Shih, 1990)), the degree of separation between the resulting units (e.g., Acces-sor Variety, see (Feng et al., 2004)) and the proba-bility of a segmentation given a string (Goldwater et al., 2006; Mochihashi et al., 2009).

A recently published work by Wang et al. (2011) introduce ESA:  X  X valuation, Selection, Adjust-ment. X  This method combines cohesion and separa-tion measures in a  X  X oodness X  metric that is maxi-mized during an iterative process. This work is the current state-of-the-art in unsupervized segmenta-tion of Mandarin Chinese data.

The main drawbacks of ESA are the need to iterate the process on the corpus around 10 times to reach good performance levels and the need to set a param-eter that balances the impact of the cohesion measure w.r.t. the separation measure. Empirically, a corre-lation is found between the parameter and the size of the corpus but this correlation depends on the script used in the corpus (it changes if Latin letters and Arabic numbers are taken into account during pre-processing or not). Moreover, computing this cor-relation and finding the best value for the parameter (i.e., what the authors call the proper exponent ) re-quires a manually segmented training corpus. There-fore, this proper exponent may not be easily available in all situations. However, if we only consider their experiments using settings similar to ours, their re-sults consistently lie around an f-score of 0 . 80 . An older approach, introduced by Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006), solely relies on a separation measure that is directly inspired by a linguistic hypothesis for-mulated by Harris (1955). In Tanaka-Ishii (2005) (following Kempe (1999)) who use Branching En-tropy (BE), this hypothesis goes as follows: if se-quences produced by human language were random, we would expect the Branching Entropy of a se-quence (estimated from the n -grams in a corpus) to decrease as we increase the length of the se-quence. Therefore the variation of the branching en-tropy (VBE) should be negative. When we observe that it is not the case, Harris hypothesizes that we are at a linguistic boundary. Following this hypoth-esis, (Jin and Tanaka-Ishii, 2006) propose a system that segments when BE is rising or when it reach a certain maximum.

The main drawback of Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006) model is that segmentation decisions are taken very locally 1 and do not depend on neighboring cuts. Moreover, this system also also relies on parameters, namely the threshold on the VBE above which the system decides to segment (in their system, this is when VBE 0 ). In theory, we could expect a de-creasing BE and look for a less decreasing value (or on the contrary, rising at least to some extent). A threshold of 0 can be seen as a default value. Fi-nally, Jin and Tanaka-Ishii do not take in account that VBE of n -gram may not be directly comparable to the VBE of m -grams if m  X  = n . A normalization is needed (as in (Cohen et al., 2002)).

Due to space constraints, we shall not describe here other systems than those by Wang et al. (2011) and Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006). A more compre-hensive state of the art can be found in (Zhao and Kit, 2008) and (Wang et al., 2011).

In this paper we will show that we can correct the drawbacks of Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006) model and reach performances comparable to those of Wang et al. (2011) with as simpler system. In this paper, in order to be comparable with Wang et al. (2011), we evaluate our system against the corpora from the Second International Chi-nese Word Segmentation Bakeoff (Emerson, 2005). These corpora cover 4 different segmentation guide-lines from various origins: Academia Sinica (AS), City-University of Hong-Kong (CITYU), Microsoft Research (MSR) and Peking University (PKU).
Evaluating unsupervized systems is a challenge by itself. As an agreement on the exact definition of what a word is remains hard to reach, various seg-mentation guidelines have been proposed and fol-lowed for the annotation of different corpora. The evaluation of supervized systems can be achieved on any corpus using any guidelines: when trained on data that follows particular guidelines, the resulting system will follow as well as possible these guide-lines, and can be evaluated on data annotated accord-ingly. However, for unsupervized systems, there is no reason why a system should be closer to one ref-erence than another or even not to lie somewhere in between the different existing guidelines. Huang and Zhao (2007) propose to use cross-training of a supervized segmentation system in order to have an estimation of the consistency between different seg-mentation guidelines, and therefore an upper bound of what can be expected from an unsupervized sys-tem (Zhao and Kit, 2008). The average consistency is found to be as low as 0 . 85 (f-score). Therefore this figure can be considered as a sensible topline for unsupervized systems. The standard baseline which consists in segmenting each character leads to a base-line around 0 . 35 (f-score)  X  almost half of the to-kens in a manually segmented corpus are unigrams.
Per word-length evaluation is also important as units of various lengths tend to have different distri-butions. We used ZPAR (Zhang and Clark, 2010) on the four corpora from the Second Bakeoff to repro-duce Huang and Zhao's (2007) experiments, but also to measure cross-corpus consistency at a per-word-length level. Our overall results are comparable to what Huang and Zhao (2007) report. However, the consistency is quickly falling for longer words: on unigrams, f-scores range from 0 . 81 to 0 . 90 (the same as the overall results). We get slightly higher figures on bigrams ( 0 . 85  X  0 . 92 ) but much lower on trigrams with only 0 . 59  X  0 . 79 . In a segmented Chinese text, most of the tokens are uni-and bigrams but most of the types are bi-and trigrams (as unigrams are often high frequency grammatical words and trigrams the result of more or less productive affixations). There-fore the results of evaluations only based on tokens do not suffer much from poor performances on tri-grams even if a large part of the lexicon may be in-correctly processed.

Another issue about the evaluation and compari-son of unsupervized systems is to try and remain fair in terms of preprocessing and prior knowledge given to the systems. For example, Wang et al. (2011) used different levels of preprocessing (which they call  X  X ettings X ). In their settings 1 and 2, Wang et al. (2011) try not to rely on punctuation and char-acter encoding information (such as distinguishing Latin and Chinese characters). However, they opti-mize their parameter for each setting. We therefore consider that their system does take into account the level of processing which is performed on Latin char-acters and Arabic numbers, and therefore  X  X nows X  whether to expect such characters or not. In set-ting 3 they add the knowledge of punctuation as clear boundaries and in setting 4 they preprocess Arabic and Latin and obtain better, more consistent and less questionable results.

As we are more interested in reducing the amount of human labor needed than in achieving by all means fully unsupervized learning, we do not re-frain from performing basic and straightforward pre-processing such as detection of punctuation marks, Latin characters and Arabic numbers. 2 Therefore, our experiments rely on settings similar to their set-tings 3 and 4, and are evaluated against the same corpora. Our system builds upon Harris's (1955) hypothesis and its reformulation by Kempe (1999) and Tanaka-Ishii (2005). Let us now define formally the notions underlying our system.
 with a left context  X   X  , we define its Right Branching Entropy (RBE) as: h
The Left Branching Entropy (LBE) is defined in a symmetric way: if we note  X   X  the right context of x 0 ..n , its LBE is defined as: The RBE (resp. LBE) can be considered as x 0 ..n 's Branching Entropy (BE) when reading from left to right (resp. right to left).
From h  X  ( x 0 ..n ) and h  X  ( x 0 ..n  X  1 ) on the one hand, and from h  X  ( x 0 ..n ) and h  X  ( x 1 ..n ) we estimate the Variation of Branching Entropy (VBE) in both direc-tions, defined as follows:
The VBEs are not directly comparable for strings of different lengths and need to be normalized. In this work, we recenter them around 0 with respect to the length of the string by substracting the mean of the VBEs of the strings of the same length. Writing  X   X h  X  ( x ) and  X   X h  X  ( x ) . The normalized VBEs for the string x , or nVBEs , are then defined as follow (we only defined  X   X h  X  ( x ) for clarity reasons): for each length k and each k -gram x such that len ( x ) = k ,  X   X h  X  ( x ) =  X h  X  ( x )  X   X  ,k , where  X   X  ,k is the mean of the values of  X h  X  ( x ) of all k -grams x .
Note that we use and normalize the variation of branching entropy and not the branching entropy it-self. Doing so would break the Harris's hypothesis as we would not expect  X  h ( x 0 ..n ) &lt;  X  h ( x 0 ..n  X  boundary situation anymore. Many studies use di-rectly the branching entropy (normalized or not) and report results that are below state-of-the-art systems (Cohen et al., 2002). If we follow Harris's hypothesis and consider com-plex morphological word structures, we expect a large VBE at the boundaries of interesting units and more unstable variations inside  X  X ords. X  This expec-tation was confirmed by empirical data visualization. For different lengths of n -grams, we compared the distributions of the VBEs at different positions inside the n -gram and at its boundaries. By plotting density distributions for words vs. non-words, we observed that the VBE at both boundaries were the most dis-criminative value. Therefore, we decided to take in account the VBE only at the word-candidate bound-aries (left and right) and not to consider the inner val-ues. Two interesting consequences of this decision are: first, all  X   X h ( x ) can be precomputed as they do not depend on the context. Second, best segmenta-tion can be computed using dynamic programming.
Since we consider the VBE only at words bound-ary, we can define for any n -gram w its autonomy as autonomous, the more likely it is to be a word.
With this measure, we can redefine the sentence segmentation problem as the maximization of the au-tonomy measure of its words. For a character se-quence s , if we call Seg ( s ) the set of all the possible segmentations, then we are looking for: where W is the segmentation corresponding to the sequence of words w 0 w 1 ...w m , and len ( w i ) is the length of a word w i used here to be able to com-pare segmentations resulting in a different number of words. This best segmentation can be computed easily using dynamic programming. We tested our system against the data from the 4 cor-pora of the Second Bakeoff, in both settings 3 and 4, as described in Section 3. Overall results are given in Table 1 and per-word-length results in Table 2.
Our results (nVBE) show significant improve-ments over Jin's (2006) strategy (VBE &gt; 0 ) and are closely competing with ESA. But contrarily to ESA (Wang et al., 2011), it does not require multi-ple iterations on the corpus and it does not rely on any parameters. This shows that we can rely solely on a separation measure and get high segmentation scores. When maximized over a sentence, this mea-sure captures at least in part what can be modeled by a cohesion measure without the need for fine-tuning the balance between the two.

The evolution of the results w.r.t. word length is consistent with the supervized cross-evaluation re-sults of the various segmentation guidelines as per-formed in Section 3.

Due to space constraints, we cannot detail here a qualitative analysis of the results. We can simply mention that the errors we observed are consistent with previous systems based on Harris's hypothesis (see (Magistry and Sagot, 2011) and Jin (2007) for a longer discussion). Many errors are related to dates and Chinese numbers. This could and should be dealt with during preprocessing. Other errors often involve frequent grammatical morphemes or produc-tive affixes. These errors are often interesting for lin-guists and could be studied as such and/or corrected in a post-processing stage that would introduce lin-guistic knowledge. Indeed, unlike content words, grammatical morphemes belongs to closed classes, therefore introducing this linguistic knowledge into the system may be of great help without requiring to much human effort. A sensible way to go in that direction would be to let unsupervized system deal with open classes and process closed classes with a symbolic or supervized module.

One can also observethat our systemperforms bet-ter on PKU and MSR corpora. As PKU is the small-est corpus and AS the biggest, size alone cannot ex-plain this result. However, PKU is more consistent in genre as it contains only articles from the Peo-ple's Daily. On the other end, AS is a balanced cor-pus with a greater variety in many aspects. CITYU Corpus is almost as small as PKU but contains arti-cles from newspapers of various Mandarin Chinese speaking communities where great variation is to be expected. This suggest that consistency of the input data is as important as the amount of data. This hy-pothesis has to be confirmed in futur studies. If it is, automatic clustering of the input data may be an im-portant pre-processing step for this kind of systems.
