We present two models, and argue that the second one, which models regular polysemy in terms of simultaneous membership to multiple basic classes, independent polysemous classes. Our best classifier achieves 69.1% accuracy, against a 51% baseline. 1.Introduction
Adjectives are one of the most elusive parts of speech with respect to meaning. For example,itisverydifficulttoestablishabroadclassificationofadjectivesintosemantic classes, analogous to a broad ontological classification of nouns (Raskin and Nirenburg 1998).Thisarticletacklespreciselythistask,thatis,the semantic classification of adjectives , for Catalan. We aim at automatically inducing the semantic class for an adjective given itslinguistic properties, as extracted from corpora and other resources.

The classes themselves are subject to experimentation. We will test two different classifications, analyzing the empirical properties of the classes and the problems in their definition. sameadjectivecanhavemultiplesenses.Differentsensesmayfallintodifferentclasses, such that it is no longer possible to identify one single semantic class per adjective.
Moreover, many adjectives exhibit similar sense alternations, in a phenomenon known as regular or systematic polysemy (Apresjan 1974; Copestake and Briscoe 1995). A special focus of the research presented, therefore, is on modeling regular polysemy. As an example of regular polysemy, take for instance the sense alternation for the adjective econ` omic exemplified in Example (1). Econ` omic , derived from economia ( X  X conomy X ), can be translated as  X  X conomic, of the economy X , as in Example (1a), or as  X  X heap X , as in
Example (1b). As we will see, each of these senses corresponds to a different semantic class in our classifications. (1) a. recuperaci  X  o from fam  X   X lia , X  X amily X ) and amor  X  os (derived from amor ,  X  X ove X ),as shown inExample (2). (2) a. reuni  X  o
The first senses in Examples (1) and (2) have a transparent relation to the denotation of the deriving noun, as witnessed by the fact that they are translated as nouns in English ( economy , family , love ),whereastheothersensesaretranslatedasadjectives( cheap , famil-iar , lovely ). For each of these adjectives, there is a relationship between the two senses, such that the sense alternations seem to correspond to a productive semantic process along the lines of Example (3)(Raskin and Nirenburg 1998, schema (43), page 173). (3) P ERTAINING TO [noun meaning]  X  CHARACTERISTIC OF [noun meaning] 576
Because of the systematic semantic relationship between the two senses of these adjec-tives, they constitute an instance of regular polysemy. In this article, therefore, we not onlyaddresstheacquisitionofsemanticclasses,butalsothe acquisition of polysemy :Our goal is to determine, for a given adjective, whether it is monosemous or polysemous, and to which class(es) it belongs. Note that we are not dealing with individual sense alternations, as related work on sense induction does (Sch  X  utze 1998; McCarthy et al. 2004; Brody and Lapata 2009), but with sense alternation types ,that systematically hold across different lemmata. Thus, the present research is at the crossroad between sense induction andlexical acquisition.
 are probably favored by the properties of human cognition (Murphy 2002). Regular polysemy has been studied in theoretical linguistics (Apresjan 1974; Pustejovsky 1995) and in symbolic approaches to computational semantics (Copestake and Briscoe 1995).
It has received little attention in empirical computational semantics, however. This is surprising, given the amount of work devoted to sense-related tasks such as Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD). In WSD (see Navigli [2009] for an overview) sense ambiguities are almost exclusively modeled for each individual lemma, despite the ensuing sparsity problems (Ando [2006] is an exception). Properly modeling regular polysemy, therefore, promises to improve computational semantic tasks such as WSD andsense discrimination.
 theoretical and empirical properties of regular polysemy. In this direction, we test two alternative approaches. We first model polysemy in terms of independent classes to be separately acquired (e.g., an adjective with two senses a defined independently of classes A and B), and sho wthat this model is not adequate.
A second approach, which posits that polysemous adjectives simultaneously belong to more than one class (e.g., an adjective with two senses a
A and class B), is more successful. Our best classifier achieves 69.1% accuracy against a 51%baseline,whichissatisfactory,consideringthattheestimatedupperbound(human agreement) for this task is 68%. We discuss pros and cons of the two models described andways toovercome their limitations.

As mentioned in the Introduction, there has been very little research in the semantic classification of adjectives. We kno wof only t wo articles on specifically this topic:
Carvalho and Ranchhod (2003) used adjective classes similar to the ones explored here to disambiguate between nominal and adjectival readings in Portuguese. Adjective information,manuallycoded,servedtoestablishconstraintsinafinite-statetransducer part-of-speech tagger. Actually, POS tagging was also the initial motivation for the present research, as adjective X  X oun and adjective X  X erb (participle) ambiguities cause most difficulties to both humans and machines in languages such as English, German, and Catalan (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993; Brants 2000; Boleda 2007).
Bohnet, Klatt, and Wanner (2002) also has similar goals to the present research, as it is aimed at automatically classifying German adjectives. However, the classification used is not purely semantic, polysemy is not taken into account, and the evidence and techniques used are more limited than the ones used here.
 different goals than ours. Yallop, Korhonen, and Briscoe (2005) tackle syntactic, not semantic classification, akin to the acquisition of subcategorization frames for verbs.
Another relevant line of research pursues WSD. Justeson and Katz (1995) and Chao and Dyer (2000) showed that adjectives are a very useful cue for disambiguating the sense of the nouns they modify. Adjective classes could be further exploited in WSD in at least two respects: (1) to establish an inventory of adjective senses (if polysemous instances are correctly detected; this is where sense induction and our own work fits in), and (2) to exploit class-based properties for the disambiguation, similar to related work on verb classes (Resnik 1993; Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth 2000; Kohomban and Lee 2005).

MiningandSentimentAnalysis(PangandLee2008),asadjectivesareknowntoconvey much of the evaluative and subjective information in language (Wiebe et al. 2004).
The typical goal of this kind of study has been to identify subjective adjectives and their orientation (positive, neutral, negative). This type of research, from pioneering work by Hatzivassiloglou and colleages (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993, 1997;
HatzivassiloglouandWiebe2000)tocurrentresearch(deMarneffe,Manning,andPotts 2010),hasthusfocusedon scalar adjectives ,thatis,adjectiveslike good and bad ,whichcan be translated into values that can be ordered along a scale. These adjectives typically enter into antonymy relations (the semantic relation between good and bad ), and in fact antonymy is the main organizing criterion for adjectives in WordNet (Miller 1998), the most widely used semantic resource in NLP. However, when examining a large scale lexicon, it becomes immediately apparent that there are many other types of adjectives that do not easily fit in a scale-based or antonymy-based vie wof adjectives (Alonge et al. 2000). Some examples are pulmonary , former ,and foldable . It is not clear, for in-stance, whether it makes sense to ask for an antonym of pulmonary , or to establish a  X  X oldability X  scale for foldable . These adjectives need a different treatment, and they are treated in terms of different semantic classes in this article.

 framework.Thisworkattemptstoestablishallthepossiblemeaningsofadjective-noun combinations, and rank them using information gathered from the British National
Corpus (Burnage and Dunlop 1992). This information should indicate that an easy problem is usually equivalent to problem that is easy to solve (as opposed to, for example, easy text , that is usually equivalent to text that is easy to read ). Thus, the focus is on the meaning of adjective-noun combinations, not on that of adjectives alone as in the present research. 3.BasisforaSemanticClassificationofAdjectives
Adjective classes in our definition are broad classes of lexical meaning. We will present lexicalacquisitionexperimentsinwhich,giventheevidencefoundincorporaandother lexicalresources,asemanticclasscanbeassignedtoagivenadjective.Forthispurpose, two preconditions are required: (a) aclassification that establishes the number and characteristics of the target (b) astable relation between observable features and each semantic class.
Thereisnoestablishedsemanticclassificationforadjectivesincomputationallinguistics that we can use and, therefore, one subgoal of the research is to establish the clas-sification in the first place, addressing (a), and exploiting the morphology X  X emantics and syntax X  X emantics interfaces for acquisition, addressing (b). We are thus facing a highly exploratory endeavor, and we do not regard the classifications we use as final. We test two different classifications: an initial classification, based on the lit-erature, for the experiments reported in Section 4, and an alternative classification, for the experiments reported in Section 5. We next turn to presenting the two tested classifications. 3.1InitialClassification
In the acquisition experiments reported in Section 4, we distinguish between qualita-tive , intensional ,and relational adjectives,whichhavethefollowingproperties(Miller 1998; Raskin and Nirenburg 1998; Picallo 2002; Demonte 2011).
 including scalar adjectives, which denote attributes or properties of objects. Adjectives in this class tend tobe gradable and comparable (see Examples (4a X 4b)). They are char-acterized by exhibiting the greatest variability with respect to their syntactic behavior:
In Catalan, they can act as predicates in copular sentences and other constructions (Examples (4c X 4d)), and they can typically act as both pre-and post-nominal modifiers (Examples (4e X 4f)). When an adjective modifies a head noun in pre-nominal position, the interpretation is usually nonrestrictive, as shown by the fact that they can modify proper nouns (Example (4e)). (4) a. Taula
Intensional adjectives. These are adjectives like presumpte ( X  X lleged X ) or antic ( X  X ormer X ), which according to formal semantics denote second-order properties (Montague 1974, and subsequent work). Most intensional adjectives modify nouns in pre-nominal posi-tion only (Example (5a)), and they cannot functionally act as predicates (Example (5b)).
Theyare also typically not gradable (Example (5c)). (5) a. El qualitative adjectives, as in Example (6). The order, however, affects interpretation:
Example (6a) entails that the referent of the noun phrase is young, whereas Example (6b) does not (McNally and Boleda 2004). (6) a. jove presumpte assass  X   X  580 sonal, botanical X ) denote a relationship to an object (in the mentioned examples, LUNG , from pulm  X  o ,  X  X ung X ) and can only modify nouns post-nominally (see Example (7a)).
Also, contrary to qualitative adjectives, they are not gradable (Example (7b)) and act as predicates only under very restricted circumstances (Example (7c) vs. (7d)). If other adjectivesormodifiersco-occurwithrelationaladjectives,theseoccur after theadjective (Example (7e)).Wewill say relational adjectives are adjacent tothehead noun. (7) a. Tenia to induce the semantic class of adjectives. For instance, if an adjective is denominal, appears almost exclusively in postnominal position, and is strictly adjacent to the head noun,wepredictthatitisrelational.IntheexperimentsreportedinSections4and5,we extractdatarelatedtotheseandotherpropertiesofadjectivesfromlinguisticresources, and use themas features in machine learning experiments. 3.2AlternativeClassification
IntheacquisitionexperimentsreportedinSection5,wedistinguishbetweenqualitative, relational, and event-related adjectives. The classification presented in Section 3.1 is thus altered in two ways: (1) The intensional class is dropped. (2) A new class, that of event-related adjectives, is added to the classification. The reasons for these changes will become clear in the discussion of the experiments in Section 4. Here, we describe the ne wclass and provide asummary table of the alternative classification.
Event-related adjectives. Adjectives such as exportador, prom` es, resultant ( X  X xporting, promised, resulting X ) denote a relationship to an event, in this case, EXPORT , PROMISE , and RESULT events, respectively. Most of them are deverbal. Like relational adjectives, they are typically nongradable (see Example (8a)) and prefer the postnominal position when modifying nouns (Example (8b)). Like qualitative adjectives, they typically can act aspredicates (Example (8c)). (8) a.  X  Es thorough discussion of previous research on the semantics of adjectives and more motivation for the classification, see Boleda [2007]). For comparison, we will briefly outline the treatment of adjectives in WordNet (Miller 1998; Alonge et al. 2000). As 582 mentioned in Section 2, the main semantic relation around which adjectives are or-ganized in WordNet is antonymy. Also as explained, however, not all adjectives have antonyms. This is solved in WordNet by the use of indirect antonyms (e.g., swift and slow areindirectantonyms,throughthesemanticsimilaritybetween swift and fast ).Still, indirect antonymy only applies to a small subset of the adjectives in WordNet (slightly over 20% in WordNet 1.5). Therefore, some kinds of adjectives receive a differentiated treatment.
 tiveadjectives,akintoourqualitativeadjectives,whichareorganizedaroundantonymy (descriptive adjectives, however, include intensional adjectives). (2) Relational adjec-tives, as defined in this article, for which two different solutions are adopted. If a suit-able antonym can be found for a given relational adjective (antonym in a broad sense; in Miller [1998, page 60], physical and mental are considered antonyms), it is treated in pointer to the related noun. In addition, a subclass of descriptive adjectives, having the form of past or present participles, is distinguished, and also receives a hybrid treatment. Those that can be accommodated to antonymy are treated as descriptive adjectives( laughing  X  unhappy ,throughthesimilaritybetween laughing and happy ).Those which cannot are linked to the source verb through a PRINCIPAL -PART -OF pointer. Our event-related class includes not only past and present participles, but other types of deverbal adjectives. Thus, most of the classes used in this article are to some extent backed up bythe organization ofadjectives in WordNet. 3.3TheRoleofPolysemy
As explained in the Introduction, some adjectives are polysemous such that each sense falls into a different class of the classifications just presented. Consider for instance the adjective econ` omic in Example (1), repeated here as Example (9) for convenience.
The two main senses of econ` omic instantiate the relational (sense in Example (9a)) andthe qualitative class (sense inExample (9b)),respectively. (9) a. an ` alisi econ ` omica of each of the associated classes. When used as a relational adjective, it is not gradable andcannotbeusedinapre-nominalposition(Example(10)).Whenusedasaqualitative adjective, it is gradable and it can be used predicatively (see Example (11)). In the experiments that follow, we aimat capturing thishybrid behavior. (10) a. #L X  X n ` alisi (11) Aquests as illustrated in Examples (12) and (13). Antic has two major senses, a qualitative one (equivalentto X  X ld,ancient X )andanintensionalone(equivalentto X  X ormer X ).Noteagain that,whenusedintheintensionalsense,itexhibitspropertiesoftheintensionalclass:It appears pre-nominally (Example (13a)) and isnot gradable (Example (13b)). (12) a. edifici (13) a. antic introduces regular polysemy, specifically, between event-related and qualitative adjec-tives, as illustrated in Examples (14) and (15). The participial adjective sabut ( X  X nown X ) has an event-related sense, corresponding to the verb saber ( X  X now X ), and a qualitative sense that can be translated as  X  X ise X . Likewise, the deverbal adjective cridaner derived from cridar ( X  X oshout X )alternatesbetweenanevent-relatedsenseandaqualitativesense. (14) problema (15) noi
Examples (14) and (15) represent cases of regular polysemy because, as can be drawn from the translations, there is a systematic shift from a transparent relation with the event to a quality that bears a more distant relation to the event. In the case of sabut the relationisclear(ifamanknowsalot,heiswise);inthecaseof cridaner ,ashirtqualifies fortheadjectiveifitisforinstanceloud-coloredorhasaneccentriccut,suchthatitgains the attention of people, as shouting does.
 pursued. Other kinds of polysemy that have traditionally been tackled in the literature will not be considered. For instance, we will not be concerned with the polysemy illustrated in Example (16), which arguably has more to do with the semantics of the 584 modified noun than that of the adjective (Pustejovsky 1995). Both of the uses of trist ( X  X ad X ) illustrated in Example (16) fall into the qualitative class, so, contrary to the work by Lapata (2000, 2001) cited previously, we do not treat the adjective as polysemous in the context ofthe present experiments. (16) noi 4.FirstModel:PolysemousAdjectivesConstituteIndependentClasses
Given the hybrid behavior of polysemous adjectives explained in Section 3, we can expect that they behave differently from adjectives in the basic classes. For instance, adjectives polysemous between a qualitative and a relational use should exhibit more evidence for gradability than pure relational adjectives, but less than pure qualitative adjectives. In this view, polysemous adjectives belong to a class, for instance, the qualitative-relational class, that is distinct from both the qualitative and the relational classes,typicallyexhibitingfeaturevaluesthatareinbetweenthoseofthebasicclasses.
In this section, we report on experiments testing precisely this model for regular polysemy. We will therefore distinguish between five types of adjectives: qualitative, intensional, relational, polysemous between a qualitative and an intensional reading (intensional-qualitative),andpolysemousbetweenaqualitativeandarelationalreading (qualitative-relational). There is one polysemous class missing (intensional-relational).
No cases of polysemy between intensional and relational adjectives were observed in our data.
 and that there is virtually no previous work on the automatic semantic classification of adjectives.Thepresentexperimentsalsoaimattestingtheoverallenterpriseofinducing semantic classes from distributional properties for adjectives. Given the exploratory nature of the experiment, we use clustering, an unsupervised technique, to uncover natural groupings of adjectives and test to what extent these correspond to the classes described in the literature. 4.1DataandGoldStandard
The experiments reported in this section are based on an eight million word fragment of the CTILC corpus ( Corpus Informatitzat de la Llengua Catalana ; Rafel 1994), developed atthe Institut d X  X studis Catalans .Eachwordisassociatedwithitslemma,partofspeech, and inflectional features, as well as syntactic function. Lemma and morphological in-formation have been manually checked. We automatically added syntactic information with CatCG (Alsina et al. 2002). CatCG is a shallow parser that assigns one or more syntactic functions to each word. In the case of the adjective, CatCG distinguishes between (1) predicate of a copular sentence; (2) predicate in another construction; (3) pre-nominalmodifier;(4)post-nominalmodifier.Asnofulldependenciesareindicated, the head noun can only be identified with heuristics.
 corpus (a total of 3,521 lemmata), and analyze the results using a subset of the data.
This is a randomly chosen 101-lemma gold standard (available in the Appendix). Fifty lemmata were chosen token-wise and 50 type-wise to balance high-frequency and low-frequency adjectives (one lemma was chosen with both methods, so the repetition was removed). Twolemmata were added in apost-hoc fashion, asexplained subsequently.
The task of the judges was to assign each lemma to one of the five classes (qualitative, intensional, relational, qualitative-intensional, and qualitative-relational). The instruc-tions for the judges included information about all linguistic characteristics discussed in Section 3, including syntactic and semantic characteristics.
 other tasks on semantics or discourse, inter-annotator scores ranging between  X  = 0 . 54 and 0 . 64 (see Artstein and Poesio [2008] for a discussion of agreement measures for computational linguistics). For comparison, V  X  eronis (1998) reported a mean pair-wise weighted  X  = 0 . 43 for a word sense tagging task in French; and Merlo and Stevenson (2001) obtained  X  = 0 . 53 X 0 . 66 for the task of classifying English verbs as unergative, unaccusative, or object-drop. Poesio and Artstein (2005) report  X  values of 0.63 X 0.66 (0.45 X 0.50 if a trivial category is dropped) for the tagging of anaphoric relations. Our judges reported difficulties in tagging particular kinds of adjectives, such as deverbal adjectives. Thisissue will be retaken in Section 4.5.
 one intensional-qualitative adjective was identified. Two intensional lemmata were manually added to be able to minimally track the class. This is clearly insufficient for a quantitative approach, however, so the intensional class is dropped in the alternative classification.Itisstrikingthatintensionaladjectives,whichhavetraditionallybeenthe focus of formal semantic approaches to the semantics of adjectives, constitute a very small class (lessthan adozen lemmata are mentioned in the reviewed literature). 4.2Features
Weusetwosetsofdistributionalfeaturestomodeladjectivebehavior:ontheonehand, theoretically motivated features ( theoretical features for short); on the other hand, features that encode the part-of-speech distribution of a four-word window around the adjective ( POSfeatures ). The former provide a theoretically informed model of adjec-tives, because they are cues to the properties of each class as described in the literature.
The latter are meant to provide a theory-independent representation of adjectives, to testtowhatextentthestructuresobtainedwiththeoreticalandPOSfeaturesaresimilar.
Bothsetsoffeaturestakeanarrowcontextintoaccount(atmostfivewordstoeachside of the adjective), because of the limited syntactic behavior of adjectives. 4.2.1 Theoretical Features. Theoretical features model the syntactic and semantic proper-ties of the classes described in Section 3. The features used, together with their mean and standard deviation values (computed on all 3,521 adjectives), are summarized in

A feature value v a , i for an adjective lemma a and a feature i corresponds to the proportion of the occurrences in which i is observed for adjective a over all occurrences of a (seeEquation (1); f stands for absolute frequency). 586 a corpus. The mean values in Table 3 are very low, which points to the sparseness of theoretically defined properties such as predicativity or gradability, at least in written texts (oral corpora would presumably yield different values). Also note that standard deviationsarehigherthanmeanvalues,whichindicatesahighvariabilityinthefeature values, something that will be exploited for classification.

This graph represents the value distribution of each feature in the form of boxplots. In the boxplots, the rectangles have three horizontal lines, representing the first quartile, the median, and the third quartile, respectively. The dotted line at each side of the rectangle stretches to theminimumandmaximumvalues,atmost1.5timesthelengthoftherectangle.Values that are outside this range are represented as points and termed outliers (Verzani 2005).

 of the ranges in the boxes overlap. This affects mainly polysemous classes: Although they sho wthe tendency predicted X  X xhibiting values that are in bet ween those of the basic classes X  X hey do not present clearly distinct values. The clustering results will be affected bythisdistribution, as will be discussed in Section 4.5. 4.2.2 POS Features. POS features encode the part-of-speech distribution of a four-word window around the adjective, providing a theory-independent representation of the linguistic behavior of adjectives. To avoid data sparseness, we encode possible POS for eachpositionasadifferentfeature.Forinstance,foranoccurrenceof alta ( X  X all X )asinEx-ample(17a),therepresentationwouldbeasinExample(17b).Intheexample,thetarget adjective is in boldface, and the relevant word window is in italics. Negative numbers 588  X   X  indicate positions to the left, positive ones positions to the right. The representation in (17) a. la features with the overall highest mean value in our data (among a total of 36 features) are listed in Table 4. Note that the mean values are much higher for the POS features (Table 4) than for the theoretical features (Table 3), as theoretical features are much sparser. 4.3ClusteringAlgorithmandParameters We use the k -means clustering algorithm (see Kaufman and Rousseeu w[1990] and
Everitt, Landau, and Leese [2001] for comprehensive introductions to clustering). is a classical algorithm, conceptually simple and computationally efficient, which has been used in related work, such as the induction of German semantic verb classes (SchulteimWalde2006)andthesyntacticclassificationofCatalanverbs(Mayol,Boleda, and Badia 2005). Also, it performs hard clustering, which is adequate for our purposes (recallfromSection4.1thatwemodelpolysemyintermsofseparateclasses).Additional experiments with other clustering methods yielded similar results: We tested two hier-archicalandoneflatalgorithm,oneofthemagglomerativeandtheothertwopartitional, with several clustering criteria, always using the cosine distance measure. from objects to their centroids (mean vectors of each cluster), which favors globular cluster structures.

We standardize to z -scores, so that all features have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. As the most interpretable results were obtained with standardized values, we will restrict the discussion in the next section to the results obtained with standardized values. 4.4Results
The discussion focuses on the cluster analyses with three and five clusters because our basis is three classes (intensional, qualitative, and relational) and we consider a total of five classes (basic classes plus polysemous classes: intensional-qualitative and qualitative-relational). A higher number of clusters introduces more noise (in the form of small clusters with no clear content).

Rows are gold standard classes and columns are clusters, labeled with the cluster number provided by the algorithm.Theorderingoftheclusternumberscorrespondstothequalityofthecluster, measured in terms of the clustering criterion (see Equation (2)), 0 representing the cluster with the highest quality. In each cell C ij of Table 5, the number of adjectives 590 of class i that are assigned to cluster j by the algorithm is given. The largest value for each class is highlighted (see gray cells).

This means that the three clusters in A and B have basically been replicated by the three first clusters in C and D, respectively. On the other hand, the differences between the structures obtained using theoretical versus POS features are more obvious in the five-way solutions. From the set-up of the experiment, we had expected one cluster per class, plus QR and IQ adjectives isolated in a cluster of their own. This is clearly not borne out in Table 6. What we find instead is that (a) the mixed clusters persist and score high in the clustering criterion (see clusters 0 in solution C and 0 X 1 in solution D, with a mixture of Q, QR, and R adjectives), and (b) two additional small clusters are created (clusters 3 and 4 in both solutions) with no clear interpretation, suggesting that the three-way set-up matches better the structure uncovered bythe clustering algorithm.
 meets the target classification better than the five-way clustering, and that polysemous adjectives are not identified as a separate class. These results suggest that modeling polysemous adjectives in terms of additional, complex classes is not an adequate strat-egy (we return tothispoint subsequently).

POS features elicited as most discriminative by the clustering algorithm are precisely those that correspond to the theoretical features. This correspondence explains the resemblance between the solutions obtained with the two types of representation and at the same time provides support for the present definition of the theoretical features.
Evaluation of clustering is very problematic when there is no one-to-one correspon-dence between classes and clusters (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993), as is our case.SchulteimWalde(2006)providesathoroughdiscussionofthisissueandproposes differentmetricsandtypesofevaluation.WedefernumericalevaluationuntilSection5. 4.5Discussion 4.5.1 Classification. Theexperimentspresentedprovidefeedbacktothequestion,whatis an appropriate broad semantic classification for adjectives? The clustering experiments provide empirical support for the qualitative and relational classes, as is particularly evidentinthethree-waysolution(Table5).Theseareclassesthathavetraditionallybeen takenintoaccountindescriptivegrammar(Bally1944;Picallo2002)andcomputational resources such as WordNet (Miller 1998; Alonge et al. 2000), so we consider them to be quite stable and keep them in our classification.
 adjectivesinallsolutions, because theydonotexhibitdistinctive enough distributional properties to differentiate them, a fact aggravated by the small size of the intensional class. From the point of vie wof NLP, it is reasonable to encode intensional adjectives by hand, given their limited number. For these reasons, we include the intensional class in the qualitative class in what follows (remember that, as mentioned in Sec-tion 3, WordNet also includes intensional adjectives in the qualitative X  X n their terms, descriptive  X  X lass). classes,playaninterestingroleinourclusteranalyses.Suchclustersseemtobecoherent and stable, as they appear in all examined solutions (A, B, and also C and D in Tables 5 and 6) and have good scores in the clustering criterion. Significantly, however, most of the adjectives that are problematic for humans are assigned to hybrid clusters, where problematic means that they are not assigned to the same class by all four judges.
Conversely,mostadjectivesinthehybridclustersareproblematic.Thus,hybridclusters are useful to signal problems in the proposed classification. As an example, consider cluster 0 in Part C of Table 6: 17 out of the 24 (70.1%) gold standard adjectives in this hybrid cluster are problematic for humans. This cluster contrasts with the qualitative cluster(cluster2ofTable6),whereonly10outofits42(23.8%)lemmataareproblematic. adjectives ( alemany  X  X erman X , menorqu  X   X   X  X enorcan X , sud-afric` a  X  X outh African X , xin` es 592  X  X hinese X ), and deverbal adjectives ( indicador  X  X ndicating X , parlant  X  X peaking X , protector  X  X rotecting, protective X , salvador  X  X avior X ). Ethnic adjectives can act as predicates of copular sentences in a much more natural way than typical relational adjectives, and seem to be vague between a relational and a qualitative reading in their semantics (Raskin and Nirenburg 1998, page 173). This kind of adjective will mainly be treated aspolysemous in the experiments reported in Section 5.
 a relationship to an object) nor intensional. They are also not typically qualitative, however, because they trigger a relationship to an event instead of denoting a simple property. For instance, protector triggers a relationship with a stable event of protecting in Example (18): A person named Serra belongs to the kind of associates who have as a primary role to protect the association. (18) Serra in the overall classification. Event-related adjectives have not received much attention in the linguistic literature, except for one particular subtype, namely, adjectival uses of the participle (Bresnan 1982; Levin and Rappaport 1986; Bresnan 1995). As for compu-tational resources, the English WordNet, as explained in Section 3, only distinguishes some participial adjectives. In the Italian WordNet, however, other event-related adjec-and LIABLE -TO ,asexemplified in Example (19) (Alonge et al. 2000): (19) a. depuratorio  X  X epurative, purifying X  CAUSES depurare  X  X odepurate/purify X . way classification between qualitative, event-related, and relational adjectives. Note that, in the revised classification proposed in this section, classes are uniformly defined according to the ontological type of their denotation: Qualitative adjectives denote at-tributes or properties, relational adjectives denote relationships to objects, and event-related adjectives denote relationships to events. The classes correspond to the three major types of entities in an ontology (attributes, objects, events), more specifically, to the way adjectives participate from those entities. In this view, relational and event-related adjectives denote properties, just as qualitative adjectives do, but they are a specific type of property involving a relationship with either an object or an event.
The classification is in fact similar to the one proposed in the Ontological Semantics framework (Raskin and Nirenburg 1998; Nirenburg and Raskin 2004).
 to morphology: In the default case, qualitative adjectives are not derived, event-related adjectives are deverbal, and relational adjectives are denominal. However, the correspondence between semantic classes and derivational type is not a one-to-one mapping. Although most event-related adjectives are deverbal, not only strictly deverbal adjectives evoke events: For instance, tangible  X  X angible X  evokes an event of touching, but there is no verb *tangir in Catalan ( tangible is built on the Latin verb tang  X  o ,  X  X ouch X ). Raskin and Nirenburg (1998, page 187) cite examples for English such as audible or ablaze . Similarly, some object adjectives are not denominal (such as bot` anic  X  X otanical X ). Conversely, some denominal or deverbal adjectives are qualitative: vergony  X  os  X  X hy X  (from vergonya  X  X hyness X ), amable (literally  X  X uitable to be loved X ; has evolved to  X  X ind, friendly X ). We will empirically check the correspondence between morphology and semantic class in Section 5.5. 4.5.2 Regular Polysemy. Our first series of experiments also provides feedback to the question, what is an adequate computational model for regular polysemy? Specifically, we have shown that the treatment of regular polysemy in terms of independent classes is not adequate. Remember that the motivation for the experiments presented in this section was the hypothesis that polysemous adjectives exhibit a linguistic behavior that participates from the basic classes involved in the regular polysemy, thus yielding feature values that are in between those of the basic classes (cf. Figure 1). Thus, we had expected that polysemous adjectives form a homogeneous group of lexical items, char-acterized precisely by the fact that they exhibit properties from each class to a certain degree. However, this expectation is not borne out in the results of the experiments.
To this respect, it is striking that QR adjectives (polysemous between a qualitative and a relational reading) are spread throughout all the clusters in all solutions. They are not identified as a homogeneous group, nor as distinct from the rest. Crucially, as pointed out in Section 4.2, the differences between the feature values of polysemous adjectives and those of the basic classes are not strong enough to motivate a separate cluster.

Accordingly, it always appears in the qualitative clusters. Conversely, militar ( X  X ilitary X ) is mostly used as a relational adjective, and is consistently assigned to one of the relational clusters in all solutions. Thus, although polysemous adjectives onaveragedoshowamixedbehavior,eachlexicalitemtendstopatternwithoneofthe basic classes. An alternative conceptualization of regular polysemy and experimental design iscalled for, and thiswill be the topic ofthe next section. 5.SecondModel:PolysemousAdjectivesSimultaneouslyBelongto DifferentClasses

With respect to the first goal,theexperimentsinthissectionrelyontheresultsofthepreviousexperiments,and use the alternative classification described in Section 3.2. The alternative classification has in addition been supported by a clustering experiment not reported here for space reasons (see Boleda, Badia, and Batlle [2004] for details and discussion). cessful at modeling regular polysemy. Furthermore, the analysis of feature values in the previous section suggests that the lack of success is not related to the spe-cific technique used in the initial experiment, but to the properties of polysemous 594 adjectives: the fact that they are used predominantly in one of their senses, and the fact that the feature distributions of  X  X olysemous classes X  largely overlap with those of the basic classes.
 semy that is based on the perspective that polysemous adjectives belong to more than one semantic class, in the framework of multi-label classification . A typical example of a multi-label classification task is Text Categorization (Schapire and Singer 2000), where a document can be described via more than one label (e.g., Health and Local ), so that it effectively belongs to more than one of the target classes. The motivation for this ne wapproach is the fact that polysemous adjectives exhibit properties of all the classes involved (see Section 3.3). The hypothesis is that the evidence found for a polysemous adjective that is polysemous between, say, a relational and a qualitative use should be strong enough for the adjective to be assigned to both the relational and the qualitative classes. Note that by assigning the adjective to the two classes independently, we make an implicit classificationoftheadjectiveaspolysemous.Thesuccessoftheapproachwill depend on whether the different senses are sufficiently represented in the data, and it will be especially challenging to distinguish between noise and evidence for a given class. 5.1DataandGoldStandard
The experiments reported in this section are based on a 16 million word fragment of theCTILCcorpus(seeSection4.1).Weadditionallyuseanadjectivedatabase(Sanrom ` a andBoleda2010)withmanuallycodedinformationaboutalladjectivesoccurringmore than 50 times in the corpus (2,296 lemmata). The database codes the derivational type (deverbal, denominal, participial, non-derived) and suffix of each adjective. from this database for the experiments. The lemmata were randomly sampled in a stratified fashion, balancing three factors of variability: frequency, morphological type, and suffix. Thus, the gold standard contains an equal number of adjectives from three frequency bands (low, medium, high), from the four derivational types, and from a seriesofsuffixeswithineachtype.Thissamplingmethodisaimedatachievingsemantic variability.

The decisions were reached by consensus and were based on expert knowledge together with the examination of the information in the database, corpus examples, and the judgments provided by322 naive subjects in a large-scale annotation experiment. cording to the three experts. These are the data used in the experiments presented in this section. The proportion of polysemous adjectives is quite high, over 17%, with qualitative-relational being the most frequent type of polysemy. Also note that 51% of the adjectives are qualitative; this will be the baseline for the machine learning experiments presented subsequently. 5.2Features 5.2.1 Feature Definition. We define five feature sets based on different types of linguistic information, to gain further insight into the properties of each class. In particular, we are interested in the properties of event-related adjectives, for which we do not have a description in the linguistic literature. Table 8 summarizes the properties of the feature sets used for the present experiments.
 the adjective database. We include this type of information because of the relevance of morphology for the ne wclassification (see Section 4.5). Func encodes the syntactic functions of the adjectives in the corpus, as explained in Section 4.1. Uni (for unigram ) and bi (for bigram ) encode the distribution of the adjective in the corpus in terms of the parts of speech of the surrounding words. Feature analysis of the first experiment showed that the word preceding and following the target were the most informative, so in the present experiment only a one-word window is taken into account. The unigram distribution ( uni ) encodes each part of speech separately, as was done in the first experiment, and the bigram distribution ( bi ) takes the left and right word jointly, to avoid feature correlation effects. In the latter feature set, only the 50 most frequent bigrams are considered, to avoid features that are too sparse. 596 properties used in the first experiment (Table 3 in Section 4.2). Upon inspection of the clustering solutions (not reported here for space reasons), some further potentially relevant distributional pieces of information cropped up that were included in the theor features of the present experiment. The ne wfeatures, summarized in Table 9, cover several aspects of the noun phrases (NPs) in which adjectives occur: The type of determiner of the NP, agreement properties (as these can correlate with semantic properties), the syntactic function of the head noun, and the presence of a potential adjective complement. The latter are usually headed by prepositions ( El Joan est` agel  X  os of feature adjacent from Section 4.2. It encodes the mean distance of the adjective to the head, in number of words, as this is a more general definition that alleviates data sparseness.
 with the following exceptions: (1) morph features are of categorical type, so their values are not numerical; (2) the two first features in Table 9, due to data sparseness consider-ations, are computed asproportions over theuse ofthe adjective asanominal modifier (see Equation (3), where a mod is the number of occurrences of the adjective as modifier); the other feature values, because they correspond to the mean distance to the head in numberofwords.ThedatasetusedforthepresentexperimentsisavailableattheACL repository. 6 5.2.2 Feature Tuning. We test the effects of feature selection in the performance of the classifiers. The features are selected according to their performance within the machine learning algorithm used for classification. Accuracy for a given subset of features is estimated by cross-validation over the training data. Because the number of subsets in-creasesexponentiallywiththenumberoffeatures,thismethodiscomputationallyvery expensive, so we use a best-first search strategy. We also experiment with binarization ofthe two categorical features ( suffix , derivational type ). 5.3Method

 approach (unsupervised vs. supervised) with respect to the first set of experiments presented in Section 4, which can be seen as a sub-optimal technical choice. After the first series of experiments that required a more exploratory analysis, however, we believe that we have now reached a more stable classification, which we can test by supervised methods. In addition, we need a one-to-one correspondence between gold standard classes and clusters for the approach to work, which we cannot guarantee when using an unsupervised approach that outputs a certain number of clusters with no mapping tothe gold standard classes.
 ondifferenttypesoflinguisticinformationcodedasfeaturesets.DecisionTreesareone of the most widely machine learning techniques (Quinlan 1993), and they have been used in related work (Merlo and Stevenson 2001). They have relatively few parameters to tune (a requirement with small data sets such as ours) and provide a transparent representation of the decisions made by the algorithm, which facilitates the inspection ofresultsandtheerroranalysis.WewillrefertotheseDecisionTreeclassifiersas simple classifiers , in opposition to the ensemble classifiers, which are complex, as explained next.
 much attention in the machine learning community (Dietterich 2000). When building an ensemble classifier, several class proposals for each item are obtained from multiple simple classifiers, and one of them is chosen on the basis of majority voting, weighted voting, or more sophisticated decision methods. It has been shown that in most cases, the accuracy of the ensemble classifier is higher than the best individual classifier (Freund and Schapire 1996; Dietterich 2000; Breiman 2001). The main reason for the general success of ensemble classifiers is that they are more robust towards the biases particular to individual classifiers: A bias shows up in the data in the form 598 of  X  X trange X  class assignments made by one single classifier, which are therefore overridden by the class assignments of the remaining classifiers. set using 10-run, 10-fold cross-validation ( 10x10 cv for short). In this schema, 10-fold cross-validation is performed 10 times, that is, 10 different random partitions of the data ( runs ) are made, and 10-fold cross-validation is carried out for each partition. To avoid the inflated Type I error probability when reusing data (Dietterich 1998), the significance of the differences between accuracies is tested with the corrected resampled t-test as proposed byNadeau and Bengio (2003). 8 5.4Results 5.4.1 Simple Classifiers. The accuracies for the simple classifiers are shown in Table 10.
Part A of the table lists the results for each of the binary decisions (qualitative/ non-qualitative, event/non-event, relational/non-relational). The accuracy for each de-cision is computed independently. For instance, a qualitative-event adjective is judged class iff the decision is event ; and correct within the relational class iff the decision is non-relational .

The motivation for reporting partial accuracy is that a class assignment with some overlap with the gold standard is more useful than a class assignment with no overlap.

Therefore, the classifications obtained with any of the feature sets are more useful than the baseline, in the sense that they present more overlap with the gold standard. 5.4.2 Ensemble Classifiers. Error analysis on the results using simple classifiers (not reported for space reasons) revealed that the errors made by the different classifiers, using different feature sets, are qualitatively quite different. This motivated the use 600 of Attribute Bagging (Ho 1998; Bryll, Gutierrez-Osuna, and Quek 2003), an ensemble classifier (EC) in which the class assignments are obtained by majority voting over randomly sampled feature subsets. 10 Attribute Bagging has two main parameters: the bag size (number of features used for each classification; it was set to 1/3 given results reported in the literature, although varying this parameter did not affect the results much),andthenumberofiterations i (wetested3,4,5,6,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90, 100; note that our total feature size is 121, see Table 8). Figure 2 shows that increasing i leads to a rapid increase of accuracy up to i = 30; with higher i , accuracy experiments only aslight increase.
 sifier and human agreement (observed agreement, in percentage). The results obtained with AdaBoost (a standard EC; default parameters) are also included as a sanity check.
The best results with Attribute Bagging, reported in the table, were obtained using both feature selection and binarization (binarization did not improve results for the remaining classifiers in Tables 10 and 11).

Ensemble classifiers are thus helpful for our task. 89.0% partial accuracy. This is comparable to the agreement between the expert anno-tation of the gold standard and naive subjects participating in a large-scale annotation experiment (p o = 0.68, or 68%, and  X  = 0.55 for full accuracy, p 0.72foroverlappingaccuracy;seeBoleda,SchulteimWalde,andBadia[2008]fordetails onthecomparison).Ifweviewhumanagreementasanupperbound,wehavereached themaximumaccuracythatcouldbeobtainedviamachinelearningforthepresenttask.
Further improvements will need to be preceded by an improvement in the agreement scores of human judges, that is, by a better definition of the classes and the classifying task.
 (90.1%), followed by the event class (86.5%), and the qualitative class has the lowest scores(atmost82%).Thequalitativeclasscontainsattribute-denotingadjectives,butin the present definition it is also populated with adjectives that simply do not fit into the other classes (such as intensional adjectives, as explained earlier). Also, whereas some adjectives in the class are prototypical qualitative adjectives such as gros  X  X ig X  or llarg  X  X ong X , others are unprototypical types of properties ( subaltern  X  X ubordinate X , subsidiari  X  X ubsidiary X ).Thisfactorbringsheterogeneityintotheclass,whichjustifiestherelatively poor performance of the classifier on this task. Significantly, also, ECs do not improve upon simple classifiers for the event class; again, morphological information acts as a ceiling and no combination of information serves to go beyond that ceiling, as will become clear in the error analysis explained next. 5.5ErrorAnalysis
Table 12 depicts the contingency table of the classifications by the experts (rows) and onerandomlychosenrunoftheAttributeBaggingclassifierwith i =100(columns).The table shows that there are two major sources of errors: First, the confusion between the qualitative and event classes, which is responsible for 14 errors (see dark-gray shaded cells in the table; also note that the related Q X  X E and E X  X E misclassifications account for another 14 errors). To compare, note that the confusion between the qualitative and relational classes only accounts for six of the errors, and there are no cases of confusion between event and relational adjectives.
 (see medium-gray shaded cells): there are 26 adjectives tagged as monosemous by the experts and assigned a polysemous class by the system. To compare, the opposite case (i.e., tagging polysemous adjectives as monosemous) accounts for 13 errors only (see light-gray shaded cells). We next examine the twomain types of errors in more detail. 602 5.5.1 Distinguishing between Qualitative and Event Adjectives. Table 12 suggests that there are difficulties in distinguishing event-related from qualitative adjectives. Feature anal-ysis confirms that the distinction between these two classes is only partially possible on morphological grounds, but not on distributional grounds. As for morphological information,Figure3showsthatmostevent-relatedadjectivesaredeverbalorparticiple adjectives,althoughthereverseisnottrue:14deverbalandtwoparticipleadjectivesare qualitative.
 as -or and the participle, sho wa clear predominance of the event class (see dark-gray (see light-gray shaded cells). Thus, the suffix seems to influence the resulting readings, with some active-like suffixes building a much more transparent relation to the event ( creador  X  X reating X , exportador  X  X xporting X , recomanat  X  X ecommended X ), and some passive-like or stative suffixes being more prone to creating a stative meaning aspectual class of the deriving verb (Vendler 1957) also plays a role: For instance, although the meaning of abundant ( X  X bundant X ) is related to that of the verb abundar ( X  X bound X ), it clearly has a more stative (property-like) meaning than many of the other event adjectives, due to the fact that the deriving verb is stative. Correspondingly, abundant isclassifiedasqualitativebytheAttributeBaggingalgorithm.Thisvariationin the morphology X  X emantics interface is also mirrored in the feature value distributions, as will be shown subsequently.
 for nine selected features across basic classes qualitative (Q), event-related (E), and relational (R), excluding polysemous adjectives. The figure clearly shows that, whereas relational adjectives tend to have a differentiated value distribution for many of the features, the values for the event-related class in general overlap with those of the qualitative class. In fact, of the 18 theoretically motivated features defined for the experiments, only two exhibit statistically significant differences in the distribution of the qualitative and event-related class according to a two-tailed t-test (  X  = 0 . 01; no equality of variance assumed). These are pre-nominal and complement-bearing (graphs A and I in Figure 4; df = 108.9/54.6, t = 3.56/  X  3.09, p-value = 0.0005/0.003, respectively).
These two features show that in general event-related adjectives appear less often than qualitative adjectives in pre-nominal position and tend to bear more complements.
Both differences are presumably due to the fact that many event adjectives inherit the argument structure of the deriving verb, with arguments expressed via PPs, constitutingheavierconstituentsthatareplacedaftertheheadnoun.Thisisbutaslight tendency and it is not homogeneous through the class, however.
 adjectives, but rather properties of relational adjectives. In addition to the properties that were already known, the figure shows that relational adjectives appear more often in definite NPs acting as preposition complements (graphs E and H). Thus, the typical syntactic context for a relational adjective is preposition + definite determiner + noun + relational adjective ).Thistypeofadjectivealsoappearsslightlymoreoftenwithfeminine headnouns,whichcouldbeduetothefactthat,inCatalan,manyabstractnouns( f  X   X sica  X  X hysics X , capacitat  X  X bility X ) are feminine, for morphological reasons. These nouns are often modified by relational adjectives to select for subtypes of the class of objects denoted bythe nouns (McNally andBoleda 2004).
 fact that it is quite heterogeneous, due to the variation at the morphology X  X emantics interface discussed earlier. This can be traced in Figure 4 by the fact that for most of the features, the box of the event class is larger than the box of the other two classes, meaning that there is more variation within the event class than within the other two classes. 604 butdistributionalinformationcannot.Asaresult,inthecaseswheremorphologygives thewrongprediction,nothingcanbedoneonthedistributionalsidetoremedythis.This results in the confusion of event-related and qualitative adjectives shown in Table 12. 5.5.2 Detecting Polysemous Adjectives. RecallfromTable12thatthesystemovergenerates polysemous adjectives: There are 26 monosemous adjectives assigned to a polysemous class. One of the reasons for this overgeneration is the procedure followed. The proce-dure treats the decision on each of the basic classes as if they were all independent.
Thus, the probability for an adjective being polysemous amounts to the product of the probabilities of the adjective belonging to each of the basic classes, as expressed in Equation (4) for twoarbitrary given classes, A and B. is more similar to the distribution obtained with the best machine learning classifier (ML) than to the distribution of polysemous items in the gold standard (GS) for the QE cases. The distribution is estimated from the frequency over the 210 adjectives in the gold standard, and shown as absolute numbers.
 type, although the gold standard contains only 7 QE adjectives. The equation predicts fewer QR adjectives than observed in the data, but in this case the classifier produces a similarnumberofQRadjectivesthanattested(22vs.23).Finally,theclassifierproduces more ER adjectives than observed and also than predicted by Equation (4), but in this case the numbers are so small that no clear tendencies can be observed. Thus, the procedure followed can be said to cause the overgeneration of items for the QE polysemy type, but it does not account for the other two polysemous classes. sponding to the middle-gray cells in Table 12; not reported because of space concerns) showed that different types of evidence motivate the inclusion of monosemous adjec-tives in two classes, causing them to be considered polysemous. This suggests that, because polysemous adjectives exhibit only partial or limited evidence of each class, the threshold for positive assignment to a class is lowered, resulting in the observed overgeneration.Recallthatatthebeginningofthissection,whenintroducingthemodel, we warned that it would be specially challenging to distinguish between noise and evidence foragivenclass.Wehaveindeedfoundthistobeachallenge.Thementioned effectisamplifiedbytheprocedurefollowed,whichassumesthattheclassassignments are independent, thus not adequately enough modeling the empirical distribution of polysemy. 6.Discussion:TowardsaModelforRegularPolysemy
The acquisition experiments presented in Sections 4 and 5 correspond to two differ-ent underlying models of regular polysemy. Figure 5 represents the two models in a simplified scenario with just two basic classes (A and B). The first model (Figure 5(a); experimentsinSection4)treatspolysemouswordsintermsofindependentclasses.The second model (Figure 5(b); experiments in Section 5) treats polysemous words alike to thoseofthebasicclasses:Polysemousassignmentsresultfrommembershipintwobasic classes.

First, the number of classes considered: Whereas the second model only considers n classes, in the general case the first model will needtoconsider 606 classes ( n monosemous classes plus n 2 polysemous classes, all the possible two-combinations of the monosemous classes). This formula assumes that only two-way regular polysemy is allowed, as in this article; polysemy across three or more classes would make the explosion of classes even worse. It is clear that the second model is easier tolearn.
 are carried out. In the first model, polysemous words are assigned to one single, inde-pendent class, whereas in the second they are assigned to each of the two basic classes thatgiverisetotheregularpolysemy.Recallthatthemotivationforthefirstmodelwas that X  X iven that regularly polysemous adjectives sho wa particular hybrid behavior X  we could expect that polysemous adjectives could be characterized as differentiated classes.Thisexpectationhasclearlynotbeenborneout.Afurtherproblemwiththefirst model it that it in principle allows for a polysemous class AB whose properties do not necessarily have anything to do with those of the basic classes A and B. The second model,incontrast,enforcesthatpolysemousadjectivesexhibitpropertiesofeachofthe classes they participate in, which is both theoretically and empirically more adequate.
Forthesereasons,webelievethatthesecondmodelismoresuitabletorepresentregular polysemy than the first model.
 previous section, in the current implementation of the model the class assignments are assumed to be independent (though this need not be the case in other instantiations of the model). Also, in a way, it is at the opposite end of the scale with respect to the first model: Whereasinthefirstmodel polysemous adjectives donotneedtohave anything in common with the basic classes, in the second model a polysemous word is assumed to be just like any other word in each of the basic classes. For instance, a qualitative-relational adjective is assumed to function both as a full-fledged qualitative adjective and a full-fledged relational adjective. By their very nature, polysemous words will sho wonly some evidence for each of the classes, as their occurrences (and thus their properties) will be distributed across the two classes. Therefore, they will be untypical members of at least one ofthe intervening classes.

Overlapping clustering (Banerjee et al. 2005), which allows for membership in multiple clusters, avoids this difficulty. Both methods have the advantage that they do not assume independence of the decisions. The most serious problem for the experiments presented in this article, however, would presumably also be a problem for these settings: The fact that the skewed sense distribution of many words makes it difficult to distinguish evidence for a particular class from noise. In the soft clustering setting, for instance, it would be hard to distinguish whether 10% evidence for class A and 90% for class B corresponds to polysemy with a skewed distribution, tonoise in the data, or simply toan untypical instance.

Such a model should take into account both the differences of polysemous adjectives with respect to the other adjectives in the basic classes (first model) and their similarities (second model), thus directly capturing their hybrid behavior. 7.Conclusion
This article has tackled the automatic induction of semantic classes for Catalan ad-jectives, with a special emphasis on regular polysemy. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such an endeavor has been carried out, as (1) related work on lexical acquisitionhasfocusedonverbs(and,toalesserextent,nouns)andonmajorlanguages such as English and German; and (2) polysemy in general has been largely ignored in lexicalacquisition,andregularpolysemyhasonlybeensparselyaddressedinempirical computational semantics.

We have showed that there is a systematic relation between the type of denotation of an adjective and its morphological and distributional properties. Our experimentshavefurthermorerelatedthelinguisticpropertiesofadjectivesasdescribed in the literature to the information that can be extracted from linguistic resources, such as corpora or lexical databases.

 discussed (predicativity, gradability, complementation patterns), as well as the types of polysemy explored, are relevant for a broader range of languages, specially Indo-
European languages (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2004). The approach does not require deep-processing resources (full parsing, semantic tagging, semantic role labeling), which makes it useful for lesser-researched languages. 608 the classification itself: The machine learning results obtained have reached an upper bound,asthebestclassifierhasachieved69.1%accuracy(againsta51.0%baseline),and the human agreement is 68%.

This is in contrast to tasks such as POS tagging or syntactic parsing, where relatively high inter-coder agreement scores are achieved. This state of affairs is probably due to the fact that semantic and pragmatic phenomena are much less well understood than morphological or syntactic phenomena.

The second main problem is thefactthatthequalitativeclasscontainsadjectivesthatdonotfitintotheotherclasses, constituting a sort of  X  X atch-all X  class. A natural extension for the work presented in this article would be to define a finer-grained categorization including the problematic cases discussed earlier. For instance, adjectives deriving from stative verbs could be distinguished from those deriving from active verbs, and different types of qualitative adjectives could be treated asdifferent classes.
 hybrid behavior, with properties from all the classes involved in each type of regular polysemy. We have empirically tested two models of the phenomenon aimed at exploiting this hybrid behavior. The first model treats polysemous words in terms of independent classes, and we have argued that it is not adequate, neither from a theoretical nor from an empirical perspective. The second model assumes that polysemous words belong to each of the basic classes participating in the regular polysemy. This model is more adequate than the first one, as it accounts for the propertiesofthebasicclassesfoundinpolysemouswords,butitfailstoaccountforthe differencesbetweenpolysemousandmonosemouswords.Toimproveonthemodeling of regular polysemy, we plan to move to token-based (word-in-context) models (Sch  X  utze 1998; Erk and Pad  X  o 2010), as opposed to type-based models as we have done inthisarticle.Thisshouldinturnshedlightintotheproblemofdistinguishingbetween evidence for aparticular class fromnoise, discussed previously.

Computational linguistic studies are also inherently limited in several aspects, such as the type of evidence that can be used or the ways in which it can be used. Despite these limitations, we believe that empirical computational linguistics approaches are agold mine of ne wkno wledge about language.
