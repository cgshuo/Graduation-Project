 1. Introduction
Healthcare information and healthcare initiatives typically need to be communicated to large professional bodies such as doctors, nurses and health managers. Health-related information can be produced by a wide variety of people including academics, doctors, government spokespersons, and in some cases, non-medical people. The Web is a popular publication medium for a wide variety of health information ( Zeng et al., 2004 ), of varying quality and accuracy ( Bernstam, Shelton, Walji, &amp; Meric-Bernstam, 2005 ), and is being increasingly seen as central to information provision within the health services ( Murphy et al., 2004 ), including in the role of keeping practitioners up to date with current guidelines. The Web also seems to be a vehicle for an increased internationalisation of medical education ( Hovenga, 2004 ). For those responsible for any aspect of healthcare information, Web publishing is a problem because of the conflicting messages it can give ( Burd,
Chiu, &amp; McNaught, 2004 ), and hence there is a need to gain insights into what healthcare information is pub-lished for any given topic in order to decide how to respond to it. Other researchers have tackled the problem of variable quality Internet information by evaluating metrics for predicting health Web site quality ( Curro ` et al., 2004; Herna  X  ndez-Borges et al., 2003 ). This is useful from the perspective of deciding which sites to use or recommend, but does not help managers identify and respond to unwanted information, particularly when it comes from an unexpected source, such as a medical article in an online newspaper.

Previous researchers have developed a variety of methods designed to identify aspects of online communi-ties or topics, although these have tended to either rely upon simple link analyses ( Garrido &amp; Halavais, 2003; Park, 2003; Tang &amp; Thelwall, 2003 ) or to be very labour intensive ( Foot, Schneider, Dougherty, Xenos, &amp;
Larsen, 2003; Weare &amp; Lin, 2000 ). In computer science, various forms of Web mining have been developed to extract information from Web pages or log files ( Chakrabarti, 2003; Kosala &amp; Blockeel, 2000 ), but these have typically not been designed to be applied to wider social issues, with the closest perhaps being community
Pennock, 2002 ). Topic identification and tracking is also a recognised task within computer science and com-putational linguistics with online variants following a long tradition of offline research, primarily through the TREC conferences (e.g., Chakrabarti, VanDen Berg, &amp; Dom, 1999 ; e.g., Clifton, Cooley, &amp; Rennie, 2004;
Ozmutlu &amp; Cavdur, 2005 ). This task is more narrowly focussed than issue analysis (as described below), how-ever, with a typical application being the identification and categorisation of news stories. Issue tracking, the task of identifying the scope of a broad social issue and tracking it, has a pedigree from before the Web as a specific social science task, triggered by the pioneering study of Lancaster and Lee (1985) , who tracked research related to acid rain over time in several databases. A more recent example is Wormell X  X  (2000) ana-lysis of topics related to the Danish welfare state, a study that was able to take advantage of the availability of multiple different sources of electronic information. In bibliometrics, the mapping of papers or authors in an attempt to describe areas of science is an established practice (e.g., Leydesdorff, 1989; Small, 1973; White &amp;
Griffith, 1982 ). In this paper we apply Web issue analysis ( Thelwall, Vann, &amp; Fairclough, in press ) to syste-matically identify all issues relevant to any selected health topic, at least those issues that are reflected on the Web. In essence, the method starts with one or more topic descriptions, such as  X  X urse prescribing X , and downloads all Web pages (via Google) that allude to the topic. These Web pages are then used for a range of types of link analysis. The pages are then processed to extract their noun phrases and a frequency table is produced giving the number of sites containing the noun or noun phrase. Nouns and noun phrases are much better indicators of topic discussed in a document than individual words since they can be complete concept representations. Site frequencies are reasonable indicators of the popularity of topics and are better than raw frequency counts or page based frequency counts because Web sites are often highly repetitive, duplicating content in many or all site pages ( Thelwall, 2002 ), which is made easy by database driven Web site technology ( D X rup, Hansen, Ribe, &amp; Larsen, 2002 ). In Web issue analysis, the set of nouns and noun phrases extracted from topic-relevant pages are the candidate topic-relevant issues . The site frequency counts of noun phrases are suggestive indicators of their topic-relevant popularity . The table of topic-relevant issues and popularities is described as the Web environment of the topic in the belief that researchers and information managers can gain useful topic-relevant insights from its Web environment.

In this paper, Web issue analysis is applied to a specific case study to demonstrate its capabilities for pro-viding management information in a national context. The medical field chosen is nurse prescribing in the UK.
The objective of the case study is to investigate whether an automated Web issue analysis can produce useful information about the context of Web publishing for nurse prescribing. 2. Nurse prescribing background
In the UK, recent years have seen a Department of Health initiative to train a proportion of nurses to pre-scribe a range of medicines. Legislation was passed in 1992 to give prescriptive powers to district nurses and health visitors so that they could legally prescribe from a restricted formulary (the Nurse Prescribers X  Formu-lary). The government announced in May 2001 that prescriptive authority would be extended to additional nurse roles within both primary and secondary care. Nurses can prescribe both as  X  X xtended X  (the Extended
Nurse Prescribers X  Formulary) and  X  X upplementary X  prescribers (the whole of the British National Formulary when they enter into a voluntary partnership with an independent prescriber). The aims of extending nurse prescribing were to provide patients with quicker access to medicine and enable nurses to use their skills appropriately. This initiative has, so far, been well received by staff and patients, having mainly positive effects, but since it is in its early stages, policy makers need to keep a close watch on how it is developing and identify any new issues that may arise ( Latter &amp; Courtenay, 2004 ). Nurse prescribing is a health issue that is partic-ularly well suited to an Internet analysis because the dispersed and relatively isolated nature of practitioners, combined with the need for ongoing support for prescribers, makes the Web a natural tool for the provision of information during and after the initial formal training period ( Smith, 2004 ).

The practice of nurse prescribing is an international one, with the US being prominent ( Hales &amp; Dignam, 2002 ). The introduction of prescriptive authority around the world has taken time to develop and establish changes. In the US only advanced practice nurses (i.e. registered nurses with advanced knowledge and skills) are allowed to prescribe. In all 50 states there are varying levels of prescriptive authority, requirements, stan-dards and practice ( Phillips, 2005; Ploncynski, Oldenburg, &amp; Buck, 2003 ), in contrast to the more uniform approach in the UK ( Mullay, Mason, &amp; Frogatt, 2003 ). In Sweden, nurse prescribing has met with severe resistance from the general practitioners and nurses have received little support ( Willhelmsson &amp; Foldevi, 2003 ). New Zealand has had legislation in place to allow prescriptive authority for both nurses and health care professionals since 1998, and this has taken time to develop and establish, with a focus on international devel-opments in USA, UK and Sweden examining what lessons could be learnt and how issues could be best addressed. The approach was taken to build strong relationships with stakeholders and flexible policy and legal arrangements that can respond to change ( Hughes &amp; Lockyer, 2004 ). 3. Methods 3.1. Design of the study The study is designed to produce three different types of information about nurse prescribing from HTML
Web pages. 1. URLs of Web pages containing the phrase  X  X urse prescribing X  (henceforth:  X  X urse prescribing pages X ). 2. URLs of pages linked from by the above pages (outlinks). 3. Noun phrases in nurse prescribing pages.

The motivating belief for collecting these three types of information is that 1. URLs may give useful information about the types and geographic locations of organisations publishing nurse prescribing-related information online. 2. URLs of links in nurse prescribing pages may indicate where nurse prescribing theory or practice is drawn from, by analogy with citations. 3. Nouns and noun phrases in nurse prescribing pages may indicate to the topics that are most relevant to nurse prescribing.

Descriptive approaches are used to summarise aspects of each of the above three types of data. 3.2. Data processing The data collection and processing stages are illustrated in Fig. 1 and are described in detail below. Collecting URLs of Web pages containing  X  X  nurse prescribing  X  X : The Google API was used to obtain from Google Web pages containing the phrase  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X . We used Google searches of international nursing sites, particularly in the US, to look for other English phrases describing the same concept but were not able to find any, so all of the results are based upon the single phrase  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X . The Google
Applications Programming Interface, or API ( Google, 2005 ), is a software tool that can be used to automat-ically send 1000 queries to Google per day. Each query returns up to 10 matches. It is possible to request up to 100 pages of 10 results for a single query, giving a total of 1000 matches. There were more than 1000 matches for  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X  so a series of queries was needed so that each query gave less than 1000 results, and the sum total of all the queries would be all Google X  X  pages containing  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X . This was achieved by identifying a set of 8  X  X  X pproximately orthogonal X  X  words. This is a set of words, each of which occurs in approximately half of all pages containing  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X , and the words are orthogonal in the sense that any two of the words would split the set of pages into four approximately equal quarters. A query was con-structed for each possible combination of inclusion and exclusion of words. These queries were submitted to
Google, via its API, and the URLs of all matching pages saved to a file. Google X  X  logic is not perfect ( Bar-Ilan, 2004; Mettrop &amp; Nieuwenhuysen, 2001; Rousseau, 1999 ) and some duplicate URLs were produced by this method. These were automatically identified and removed.

Page URL distribution statistics : In order to see which types of sites contain the phrase  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X , the set of URLS reported by Google was processed and summarised by domain name. The domain name of an
URL is normally the portion after the initial http:// and before the first subsequent slash. In most cases the collection of URLs sharing a common domain name form a coherent  X  X ite X , although there may be any number of pages in a  X  X ite X . A different heuristic for identifying sites may also be used: including all pages with domain names with the same ending (e.g. the  X  X ite X  wlv.ac.uk would also include www.wlv.ac.uk and www.scit.wlv. ac.uk ). There are some exceptions, such as www.geocities.com , which contains over a million individual sites.
Nevertheless, equating domain names with sites seems a reasonable approximation for the URL data and this kind of approach is in common use in commercial Web server log file analysis software. Nevertheless, this is an assumption that needs to be assessed in practice by the relevance of the results produced. A ranked list of domains and the number of URLs associated with each domain was calculated to give an illustration of the most productive sites for nurse prescribing.

Domain names can usefully be assigned to generic site types in some cases, mainly based upon the structure of the domain name. The top-level domain (TLD) of a domain name, normally the segment of letters following the final dot, exists in the three main varieties.

National TLDs are normally administered by a country and intended to signify affiliation with that coun-try. In practice, however, there are exceptions, such as .tv being widely used for television, and .fr being used to signify predominantly French-language sites.

Specific TLDs (e.g., edu, mil, gov) have their use restricted, again with some exceptions, to a specific type of user (e.g., US education, military and government, respectively).

Generic TLDs (e.g. com, org, info) are widely used for many purposes (despite their initially prescribed remit).

A ranked list of TLDs provides some evidence of the origins of the pages in the data set but the usage exceptions discussed above and the generic TLDs X  unknown purposes combine to make the ranked list sug-gestive of page distribution rather than definitive.

Some country codes are subdivided by second-level domain, effectively creating both specific and generic second level domains. The second level domains can give useful information about the origins of the pages in some cases. For example, nhs.uk pages are from the UK National Health Service (NHS) whereas .co.uk pages tend to be UK companies, although, like .com, this ending is widely used. Note that most European countries (e.g., France) do not use a second level domain naming system. The terminology STLD is used to describe sites grouped by second-level domain where such a convention exists, and otherwise grouped by
TLD. A ranked list of STLDs provides a more fine-grained description of site origins than a TLD ranked list and is particularly useful when a significant number of URLs originate in countries using the second-level naming system.

Identifying Web pages containing  X  X  nurse prescribing  X  X : The file of URLs reported by Google as containing  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X  was filtered to remove all non-HTML Web pages, and the remainder downloaded using the program SocSciBot ( Thelwall, 2004 ).

Outlink statistics : All URLs returned by the Google searches were downloaded. The hyperlinks in each page were extracted. For each page, all links to other pages within the same site were discarded because these site self-links ( Bjo  X  rneborn &amp; Ingwersen, 2004 ) tend to be for navigational purposes and are less sig-nificant than links to other sites, which presumably tend to be more deliberately chosen ( Smith, 1999 ). The remaining  X  X ite outlinks X  ( Bjo  X  rneborn &amp; Ingwersen, 2004 ) seem likely to indicate pages that the authors of the nurse prescribing pages thought relevant to their topic. Presumably the network formed by the interlink-ing pages centres on nurse prescribing and its structure will cast some light on the nurse prescribing Web environment. Presumably also, the most frequently linked to pages from this set tend to be most useful to the nurse prescribing topic, and so it would be useful to identify the most frequent link URLs. By extension, the most frequently linked to domains, TLDs and STLDs may give information about the distribution of links.

Text extraction and collation : A program was written to process each downloaded Web page and extract its text, discarding its HTML tags. This produced a set of files of plain text, one for each Web page. These files
Sites were identified by domain name, using the second level domain name or third-level domain as appropri-ate. For example, in the .edu domain, the second level domain identifies university Web sites (e.g., washing-ton.edu ) whereas for .uk the third level domain identifies the site (e.g., oxford.ac.uk ).

Part of speech tagging : The free program Lingua::En::Tagger 0.11 ( Coburn, 2005 ) was used to tag each indi-vidual text file for parts of speech. This involves automatically assessing each word and predicting its correct part of speech, using a dictionary and a mathematical model based upon the word and surrounding text ( Mit-kov, 2003 ).

Noun and noun phrase extraction : Lingua::En::Tagger 0.11 ( Coburn, 2005 ) was used to extract (a) a list of nouns and (b) a maximal list of noun phrases from each tagged file. Noun phrases are extracts from sen-tences that contain nouns and are judged by an artificial intelligence algorithm to form a coherent phrase.
Nouns and noun phrases were both listed in a separate file for each Web page. Nouns are not necessarily single words, but could be consecutive words describing a single object, for example Public Health. The noun phrase list was calculated maximally in the sense of (i) identifying the longest possible phrases con-taining each noun and then (ii) for each identified noun phrase adding any shorter noun phrases contained in the longer phrase.

Noun and noun phrase collation : A single list was created of all noun phrases, recording the number of sites in which they appeared.
 4. Results
The Google API searches returned 6772 URLs from 1619 domains. After downloading these URLs and excluding errors and non-HTML pages, there were a total of 1217 Web sites containing some text, although the smallest contained only a few words. 4.1. Page URL statistics The results show that a clear majority of pages containing the phrase  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X  come from the
UK domain. Presumably most of the com and org results are also UK sites. Notable for its virtual absence is the edu domain, indicating that nurse prescribing is not an academic topic in the US, either because the con-cept is not widely recognised or because other words are used to describe this activity. The former is more likely: the key concept in the US seems to be that of the advanced nurse practitioner, with prescribing not being a core part of the role since some states have not allowed it ( Rosseter, 2000 ). Moreover, there did not seem to be an equivalent phrase in the US Web documents that discussed prescribing for nurses. In this context, however, the small but significant percentage of US government gov pages is interesting. Even though nurse prescribing is an English phrase, the absence of significant pages in non-English nations points to an absence of the concept from the rest of European academic Web at least, unless an alternative phrase is used, since Web publishing in English is widespread in European universities (about 50% of pages are English) ( Thelwall, Tang, &amp; Price, 2003 ).

The STLD results are useful for the subdivision of UK pages, surprisingly showing a dominance of com-mercial domain sites. Tables 1 and 2 point to a cause: Web sites of journals and magazines. This also seems to account for the com domain X  X  prominence. The US government .gov domain is an apparent anomaly as a sig-nificant non-UK source. An investigation into the source of URLs from this domain found them all to come from PubMed, ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed ) being mainly online journal articles or abstracts written by British authors. Hence the .gov results should not be associated with US origins.

From a methods perspective, note that the third column of Table 1 is similar to Table 2 , which is almost redundant (see also Tables 3 and 4 ) indicating that for this issue multiple domain names for a single site are not a significant factor. This would probably not have been true for a more purely academic topic, for exam-ple, because many universities make extensive use of multiple domain names ( Thelwall, 2002 ). 4.2. Link URL statistics
Link URLs continue the theme of UK dominance of the phrase  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X , but with a slightly increased internationalism ( Table 1 ). By analogy with citations ( Borgman &amp; Furner, 2002 ), which have been theorised as tending to reflect the transfer or use of prior knowledge ( Merton, 1973 ), the distribution of link
URLs may reflect the countries or domains that influence nurse prescribing practice. Alternatively, they may also reflect, at least in part, the location of resources related to nurse prescribing, or the wider social or organ-isational connections of those that discuss nurse prescribing ( Harries, Wilkinson, Price, Fairclough, &amp;
Thelwall, 2004; Wilkinson, Harries, Thelwall, &amp; Price, 2003 ). This is consistent with the hypothesis that nurse prescribing is a very UK-centred topic in all regards, at least on the Web, assuming the generic TLDs to be
UK-dominated because of the absence of a strong showing for any non-UK national TLD. It would be inter-esting to see if this is reflected in scholarly literature citations. The STLD results echo the page URL co.uk dominance within the UK, but the most linked to sites and domains ( Table 4 ) emphasise the importance of the UK government for nurse prescribing, unusual for an academic topic ( Stuart &amp; Thelwall, 2005 ). Of note is the relatively low showing of the natural  X  X wner X  of the nurse prescribing topic, nhs.uk, perhaps because much internet-type activity occurs through the huge virtual private network NHSnet ( NHSnet, 2005 ), which is not part of the Internet. The NHS is the UK X  X  government-run national health service system, with most of its services being free or subsidised ( www.nhs.uk/England/AboutTheNhs/Default.cmsx ). The minor role of nhs.uk perhaps also reflects the fact that nurse prescribing is primarily an internal NHS matter, and so there is little need to publish information about it to the public.

Table 5 includes some general Web resources, such as Adobe Acrobat, as highly linked to pages, but it is difficult to effectively interpret this table because some of the URLs are present as a result of repeated links across the pages of a single site. This is the case for the parliament.uk links, for example.

The overall results ( Tables 1 X 5 ) are consistent with nurse prescribing being driven by UK journals and pro-fessional magazines, strongly supported by UK universities and drawing upon these two sources and the UK government. Web publishing is natural in academia, in contrast, and the legal implications and regulations for nurse prescribing are a natural reason for government publishing on the topic. 4.3. Interlinking Fig. 2 shows the interlinking of the top 50 sites using as raw data the links from nurse prescribing pages.
The link structure is relatively sparse despite the connectivity of the four relatively peripheral sites (google, msn, doubleclick, adobe). This suggests that the practice of linking is relatively unimportant to nurse prescrib-ing on the Web and that nurse prescribing could not be considered a strongly nationally structured online topic.
 4.4. Text analysis
Many of the most frequent nouns were general words, such as nurse, health and university. The top 1000 nouns were inspected, and it was found that many were not relevant: 35 related to time or date; 21 were uni-versity-related terms; 88 were geographic descriptions; and 14 were Internet-specific words. After excluding these types of noun, the left of Table 6 gives a more interesting set. The right of Table 6 gives the top 30 noun phrases, excluding single word nouns. Since these were almost all topic-relevant, an unedited list is presented. Note that multiple-word  X  X  X ouns X  X  are included as nouns, typically being sets of consecutive capitalised words.
Confusingly, counts of nouns that are also noun phrases are different: this is because heuristics are used to extract both.

The noun and noun phrase tables are exploratory tools, designed to give stakeholders a broad overview of the range of topics discussed on the Web in relation to nurse prescribing. For example, from Table 6 (rank 35/ rank 4) a lesson may be drawn that mental health is widely seen as important for nurse prescribing. This is probably not caused by a focus on mental health nurses, who have not been at the forefront of nurse prescrib-ing ( Nolan, Bradley, &amp; Carr, 2004 ) and hence reflects important concerns of general nurses. General nurses may be able to recognise the signs and symptoms of someone suffering from mental illness and also help undi-agnosed patients to access mental health services: two important reasons for them to need information about this issue since one in four people in the UK experience serious mental distress at some point in their life ( Camm, 2005 ). In the US every state already has prescriptive authority for mental health nurses ( Gournay, 2002 ).

Interestingly, the noun and noun phrase results do not overlap to the extent that might be expected. This overlap suggests that both should continue to be used. Logically, noun phrases ought to be better because they are more specific (e.g.  X  X niversity of Cambridge X  rather than  X  X niversity X  and  X  X ambridge X ) but the high fre-quency of the word  X  X niversity X  is also in this case a useful indicator that many universities are discussed, so the generality of nouns can sometimes be an advantage. Nevertheless, there seems to be more scope for automat-ing the noun phrase analysis because its results did not need to be manually filtered.

It is probably not possible to give a definitive list of the unexpected items in Table 6 : presumably different stake holders will see different sections of the picture and the table will serve to illuminate sections in which they are less well engaged. 5. Discussion As discussed in Section 3 , all the data should be viewed in the knowledge of the limitations of its origins.
The documents included are those that are (a) publicly available on the Web and (b) indexed in Google. Point (a) is a purpose of the study, but should not be forgotten, and the omission of invisible Web pages ( Ru &amp;
Horowitz, 2005 ), and presumably many in NHSnet, is a serious concern. Viewing Web documents as a subset of all documents about the topic, the large number of academic pages is not necessarily an indicator of more academic than commercial interest, but of a greater tendency for academics to publish on the Web ( Lawrence &amp; Giles, 1999 ), related to a culture of openness and inter-organisational information sharing ( Whitley, 2000 ).
An important corollary, however, is that all the results (e.g. concerning national differences) will be skewed towards academic pages. Point (b) is an additional limitation because search engines have biases, for example better coverage of documents in developed nations ( Vaughan &amp; Thelwall, 2004 ).
 The generation of summary statistics through URL processing, for example domain names, TLDs and
STLDs, is another limitation because of the underlying assumptions discussed above concerning the origins of the pages (e.g. .uk pages tend to be of UK origin). In one case, for pages from the .gov domain, the assump-tion was checked and found not to be correct. It seems reasonable, however, to use these aggregation methods and then to either manually check any apparent anomalies that they produce, or, if significant time is avail-able, to check all of the results.

The approach used in this paper, giving the top results in each category, is probably most appropriate for categories where the top few results formed the vast majority of the data (e.g. Table 1 ) but is less satisfactory when the top results form a small percentage of the data, and possibly a misleading one. A more accurate approach in the latter case would be to take a random sample of results and report a classification of these using content analysis ( Weare &amp; Lin, 2000 ). This approach was not adopted, however, because the ultimate goal of this research is to develop tools that can automate the extraction and processing of data. Hence it is necessary to avoid any method that requires extensive human work. Consequently, however, the tables should be treated as suggestive evidence rather than conclusive proof of any patterns found.
 The methods used are sensitive to the actual phrase chosen,  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X . There may be other
English phrases that describe the same concept, particularly outside of the UK, but we were unable to find any before the data collection or in the results, so it seems likely that no such phrases are in common use in academia in the English speaking world. In particular, the results point to nurse prescribing being less sig-nificant as a concept in the US because no alternative phrase was found suggesting that the nurse practitioner status dominates and that prescribing is seen as a secondary issue. Of course, in non-English speaking coun-tries there may well be phrases equivalent to  X  X  X urse prescribing X  X . This is a concern that was less significant for the previous Web issue analysis study ( Thelwall et al., in press ) of the impact and spread of a United Nations initiative which was associated with a specific phrase.

A generic automated technique to improve the quality of the results would be to develop algorithms that processed the contents of each page, discarding segments that were identified as likely to be irrelevant (e.g.,
Miles-Board, Carr, &amp; Hall, 2002 ). These irrelevant segments would probably include advertising and naviga-tion bars. An alternative would be to only process only text and links that were close to the identified phrase.
The former technique would probably be unsuitable for PDF analyses. The natural language processing algo-rithms used are another part that could potentially be improved, for example customising the algorithms to recognise medical terminology.
 6. Conclusions
The Web analysis was able to identify a number of interesting facts. Whilst many would probably serve to confirm stakeholders X  suspicions, others (e.g. mental health, the UK focus, the minor nhs.uk role, the discon-nectedness of nurse prescribing Web sites) may present surprises. Overall, then, the results should help give managers an evidence-based map of online nurse prescribing information, as well as suggesting avenues for further exploration. It is important that the results of a Web issue analysis should be interpreted by a human expert and not taken at face value, however, in case false connections have been identified because of anom-alous publishing practices. The Web approach seems promising because it can give useful and timely informa-tion, can be almost fully automated and uses a free data source. The quality of information could be improved, when full automation is not necessary, with additional manual filtering to remove anomalies, or to classify random samples. Future similar studies will give the additional benefit of allowing comparisons between different topics that will help identify anomalies.
