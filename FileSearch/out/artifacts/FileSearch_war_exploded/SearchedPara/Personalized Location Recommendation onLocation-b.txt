 Personalized location recommendation is a special topic of recommendation. It is related to human mobile behavior in the real world regarding various contexts including spa-tial, temporal, social, and content. The development of this topic is subject to the availability of human mobile data. The recent rapid growth of location-based social net-works has alleviated such limitation, which promotes the de-velopment of various location recommendation techniques. This tutorial offers an overview, in a data mining perspec-tive, of personalized location recommendation on location-based social networks. It introduces basic concepts, sum-marizes unique LBSN characteristics and research oppor-tunities, elaborates associated challenges, reviews state-of-the-art algorithms with illustrative examples and real-world LBSN datasets, and discusses effective evaluation methods. Location Recommendation, Location-Based Social Networks, Personalization
The rapid growth of cities is accompanied with an in-creasing number of locations with specific functions, e.g., restaurants, theaters, and hotels, to enrich people X  X  life and entertainment, providing us with more choices of life expe-rience than before. Generally, people are willing to explore a city and its neighborhood, and go to a  X  X ew X  place which he has never visited before. These activities involve a deci-sion making process related to the user X  X  personal interests w.r.t. the various choices of POIs. In the meantime, how to efficiently make a satisficing decision among a large number of POIs becomes a challenging problem for the user, usually referred to as  X  X hoice paralysis X .

Addressing such a problem corresponds to a task named location recommendation, which aims to help users filter out uninteresting POIs and save their time in decision making.

His research interests are in computing with online trust and distrust, recommendation, mining so-cial media data, data mining and feature selection. He co-presents two tutorials in KDD2014 and WWW2014, and has published innovative works in highly ranked journals and top conference proceedings such as IEEE TKDE, ACM TKDD, DMKD, ACM SIGKDD, SIGIR, WWW, WSDM, SDM, ICDM, IJCAI, AAAI, and CIKM. He also worked as a research intern in Yahoo!Labs in 2013. Updated information can be found at http://www.public.asu.edu/~jtang20 .
Huan Liu is a professor of Computer Science and Engi-neering at Arizona State University. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Southern California and B.Eng. in Computer Science and Electrical Engineer-ing at Shanghai JiaoTong University. Before he joined ASU, he worked at Telecom Australia Research Labs and was on the faculty at National University of Singapore. He was rec-ognized for excellence in teaching and research in Computer Science and Engineering at Arizona State University. His re-search interests are in data mining, machine learning, social computing, and artificial intelligence, investigating problems that arise in many real-world, data-intensive applications with high-dimensional data of disparate forms such as so-cial media. His well-cited publications include books, book chapters, encyclopedia entries as well as conference and jour-nal papers. He serves on journal editorial boards and nu-merous conference program committees, and is a founding organizer of the International Conference Series on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling, and Prediction ( http://sbp.asu.edu/ ).
