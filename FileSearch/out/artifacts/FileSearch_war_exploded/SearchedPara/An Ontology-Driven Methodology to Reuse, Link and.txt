 Pragmatics is a relatively young area of Lingui s-tics. In effect , according to Crystal (1992), at the beginning of the nineties,  X  X o coherent pragmatic theory X  had  X  X een achieved, mainly because of the variety of topics it has to account for X , such as (i) speech acts (Searle, 1975); (ii) deixis, pr e-suppositions and implicatures (Levinson, 1983; Grice 1975; 1989); or (iii) pragmatic coherence relations (Hovy and Maier, 1995; Romera, 2004; Asher and Lascarides, 2003; Pr X vot, 2004) . view s of p ragmatics can be found in Yule (1996). Yet , the different theories and a p-proaches to p ragmatics are even now quite fra g-mentary and dis connected. Thus, the way to link the pragmatic categories derived f rom these theories is not obvious . Besides, most of these theories are under development and lack a proper sub-classification of the pragmatic objects and phenomena that they study (Pareja -Lora, 2012b; 2013a) . They are usually based on some exam-ples that s upport their assumptions , but which are insufficient to apply these theories to unr e-stricted texts and dialogues . Furthermore, the sub-classification s and the particularizations of these theories must be frequently re -defined ad hoc for each project (Pareja -Lora et al., 2013b) and are often incomplete and/or biased towards each project assumptions . that account for pragmatic categories are partial, disconnected and/or poorly detailed. Thus, they require b eing fully subcategorized and deve l-oped, as well as being conveniently linked, in order to complement each other and overcome their fragmentation . This was the main aim of the research presented in Pareja -Lora (2012b; 2013a) : the creation of a comprehensiv e concep-tualization that linked these pragmatic categ o-ries , suitable for the pragmatic annotation of texts and dialogues. This was achieved by means of the development of some ontology modules , since they have already been successfully ap-plied for similar purpose s (Chiarcos, 2008; Buitelaar et al. , 2009) . lowed to build and link these ontology modules and other similar ones ( Pareja -Lora, 2012a; 2012c; Pareja -Lora and Aguado de Cea, 2010) , together with a number of recommendations and lessons learned from their development and our previous experiences in this area. They helped us evaluat e, reuse and merge these terminological resources as well as make them interoperate. Moreover, t hey also helped us identify their t er-minological gaps and decide how to fill them in systematically . details how we built the ontology module of pragmatic categories, suitable for pragmatic an-notation , by reusing, merging and linking some other terminological and language resources. Section 3 present s the ontology -driven recom-mendations for terminological works that we identified as we built this ontology , as well as other related ones. Finally, s ecti on 4 unfolds the conclusions of this research . As explained in the Introduction, this research originated from the need to link and to suppl e-ment several terminological and language re-sources dealing with p ragmatics categories. Towards this end, we built some interrelate d ontological modules that could give a coherent and interoperable view over them and help in their annotation. For their development, we used ples , the main problems that we had to face when developing one of the ontological modules aforementioned , namely the one including pra g-matic relations and units . First, we present the problems associated to linking and merging the different terminological resources that we r e-used. Second, we discuss how we identified and filled the resulting terminological gaps. Figueroa et al., 2012). 2.1 Linking and Merging Terminological As mentioned above, this section presents how we overcame the problems that we had to face when devel oping our ontological module of pragmatic relations and units . In particular, the part dealing with pragmatic relations had to pr o-vide an ontological hierarchy of object properties as a result , despite object property hierarchies are not very common as yet (this is a fairly new fea-troduces the methodology we followed to build it (Subsection ); h ow the top -level hierarchy of pragmatic unit s was generated (Subsection 2.1.2); and how we linked both hierarchies t o-gether (Subsection 2.1.3) . 2.1.1 Linking and Merging the Resources The top-level classes of the ontological modules and the relations that link them were fairly easy to identify and model. First ly, we retrieved a taxonomy of discourse and pragmatic coherence relations, elaborated by Hovy and Mai er (1995). This taxonomy survey ed the discourse and pragmatic coherence relations identified in the literature so far. All we had to do was to forma l-ize the pragmatic counterpart of this taxonomy in our ontology module s. This process was quite straightforw ard : i) We included two new object properties in the ii) We linked them both, stating that the latter is iii) Then, we followed a similar process to for-coherence relations differently . For instance, the term interpersonal coherence relation is som e-times used instead (Hovy and Maier, 1995) . So, to account for these other equivalent terms, we added a new rdfs:subPropertyOf Pragma-ticRelation to the ontology, i.e. Inter-personalCoherenceRelation , and added also an owl:equivalentTo statement , that link ed the latter to PragmaticCoherence-Relation . PragmaticCoherenceRelation with two labels, namely  X  X ragmatic coherence re-lation X  X en and  X  X nterpersonal coher-ence relation X  X en instead, by means of the rdfs:label annotation property. However, we found it more adequate to model this relationship at the conceptual level, since (a) it allows to d e-velop a sub-ontology with the terminology of each author and/ or theory for the corresponding ontological items (objects or object properties), and link all equivalent terms and/or ontological items also at the conceptual level; (b) any change in the definition of one of these terms that turns it into a new ontological item requires simply to remove the corresponding owl:equivalentTo or owl:equivalentClass statement; or else, in the latter case, substitute it with the definition of a new suitable relation (i.e . obje ct property); and (c) the use of the rdfs:label is fairly la n-guage -dependent . Thus, our approach is more abstract and modular, as well as theory -and la n-guage -independent. The same reasoning was applied in what follows.
 ation object property and its related term were theory -dependent. Including only this equivalent would have entail ed biasing the ontology to some extent. In effect , s ome potential users of the ontology would not find their own way to refer to this concept i n the ontology , and discard (re -)using it. So , just in case, we decided to (a) try and identify in the literature any other equivalent terms referring to this concept ; and (b) model and link them analogously . Eventua l-ly, we found the term participation framework relation (Schiffrin 1987; Redeker, 1990) to be equivalent . So we added the concept Partici-pation-RelationFramework to the ontology and linked it to the other two equivalent concepts by means of two owl:equivalentTo stat e-ments as wel l. pragmatic relations. We used two different te r-minological sources towards this end: a termin o-logical resource in the domain of linguistics, i.e. and a Pragmatics b ook, i.e. Yule (1996). From SIL/GLT we extracted the terms Exophora , Homophora , and Deixis (and its sub types ); and from Yule (1996), Hedging (and its subclasses ), Mitigation , and AdjacencyPairRelation (and its sub types ). Finally, we modeled them in this ontological module as well (as object prope r-ties, like pragmatic coherence relations ). 2.1.2 Linking and Merging the Resources Then , we had to detail the pragmatic units that are inter -related by the pragmatic relations dis-cussed above . So we added a class hierarchy to this ontological module to formalize this type of pragmatic elements. Building this hierarchy overall was not easy, since the literature does not identify clearly what pragmatic units are or how they can be sub-classified (cf. Yule, 1996). However, we found out that 1. The different pragmatic coherence relations 2. Pragmatic coherence relations link together 3. Some authors refer to pragm atic units as 4. There is yet another and most prominent type PragmaticUnit class and the concep ts Prag-2.1.3 Linking Pragmatic Units by M eans of tion , Pragmateme and SpeechAct as sub-classes of the former concept. We also (a) creat-ed a sub -ontology of PFU s, quite similar to the sub-ontology of pragmatic relations identified in Hovy and Maier (1995) ; and (b) included the subclasses o f SpeechAct traditionally identified in the literature, namely Representative , Expressive , Commissive , Directive and Declaration (Searle, 1975; Yule 1996) . Finally, we had to link these pragmatic units by means of the pragmatic relations that hold among them. This was achieved by including in the ontology the corresponding rdfs:domain and rdfs:range statements. For example, we co n-strained (a) the domain and the range of a PragmaticCoherenceRelation to Macro-proposition ; and (b) the domain and the range of AdjacencyPairRelation to SpeechAct . 2.2 Identifying and Filling Termino logical Up to this point , we had already developed a couple of ontological taxonomies , whose con-cep ts were not uniformly sub-classified . Thus , we had to discover if some other concepts and/or sub-ontologies were missing and, if so, model them as well . We found out that, for example, the hierarchy of speech acts had not been suff i-ciently detailed for their application to pragmatic annotation yet . So it was built practically from scratch as explain ed below . The remaining sub-ontologies and gaps identified in our ontology were filled following the same approach. 2.2.1 Developing the Speech Act Sub-In order to build the sub-ontology of speech acts, we followed a top-down approach, since we had at least (1) the top -level sub -classification of speech acts into representatives, expressives, commissives, directives and declarations (Searle, 1975; Yule, 1996); (2) some examples of these sub-classes of speech acts included in Yule (1996) and in SIL/GLT; and (3) a contrastive (English -Spanish) taxonomy of expressive and fore being previously evaluated for its suitability as for a speech act taxonomy. Some of its verbs (e.g. pronounce) did not refer to real speech acts and, besides, we had to identify other possible speech acts not included in this classification (its potential gaps ). Thus, s ome general -purpose language resources were (re -)used towards this end (see below) . speech acts from the entries against the defin i-tions of a general -purpose language resource found out that some of the related definitions were circular , tautological and/or inconsistent. state that Command and Advice are subclasses of Directive . So, to build this part of the hie r-archy, we looked up their corresponding verbs in  X  advise : tions:  X  command : (Faber and Mairal, 1999 ) is  X  X o tell X . This, recu r-sively, led us to look for a relevant definition of  X  X ell X  , and we found out that it entailed a taut o-logical definition :  X  tell : fers to  X  X dvise X . Besides, when we looked up  X  X rder  X  in this dictionary , we found out that it contained another circular definition involving  X  X ell X  :  X  order : consistent, since  X  X rder X  might entail  X  X  position of authority X  of the speaker that is not a real characteristic of  X  X ell X .
 by evaluating these terms with MW LD 10 1. We searched for the top-level performative does not include circular and/or tautological def-initions for them. Th us, we built the sub-classification of speech acts of Searle (1975) and Yule (1996) as follows: 2. We compiled a list of the ir related terms in 3. We looked up their definitio n in the M WLD, 2.2.2 An Algorithm to Build Terminological To develop our hierarchy, we used an algorithm that we designed following th e approach in Dik (1989) to construct stepwise lexical defini tions (also followed in Mairal -Us X n and Peri X  X n-Pascual (2010) to define stepwise conceptual decompositions ). the terms we had already selected as follows. First, we took the term definitions and split them into their genus and differentiae . Second, we further split their differentiae into their basic components (that is, into their semantic features and/or characteristic type values (ISO/ /DIS 24156-1) ). Third, we grouped together the terms that shared both their genus ( G ) and one differe n-tia basic component ( DBC ). Fourth, we included a concept C in the ontology for G (if no t yet pr e-sent), a nother concept, C X  , for the compositional semantics of G + DBC , and an owl: subClassOf statement that linked C X  to C . Fifth, we removed the terms for C and C X  from the list (if present). And sixth, we iterated this process until we had incorporated a concept for tion, we attached its associated differentia basic components to each concept in the ontology , as data properties and property values  X  see General Recommendation . The hybrid terminological and ontological r e-search works described above (as well as some other related works, not described here for space driven best practices that should be applied on ontology-based terminological works. They can be classified, according to their scope, as (1) general recommendations; and (2) recommenda-tions for terminological resource merge and link . They are discussed in a dedicated subsection below. 3.1 General R ecommendations The main general recommendations for develop-ing ontology-based terminological works are the following: 1.

The rdfs:label property allows specifying In this paper, we have presented how we built a set of ontology modules that include pragmatic categories . These ontology module s have been built on several other terminological and la n-guage resources, in order to overcome the biases, disconnections and lack of details and sub-classificat ion that this area shows altogether. In particular, our ontological modules provide a comprehensive abstract model over the termino l-ogy of p ragmatics and pragmatic categories , which has helped link, merge, comple ment and extend these different resources, a nd make them interoperate . lowed t o build these ontology modules . In pa r-ticular, we have shown the usefulness of object property hierarchies in this type of terminolog i-cal works and how they can be easily created. Our methodology includes also a set of reco m-mendations and lessons learned so far when modeling this and other ontology-based termin o-logical resources in the linguistic domain. hierarchies of concepts, which constitute the backbone of conceptual models in terminology works and/or in ontologies. As ontological te r-minology works become more frequent, these recommendations will become more necessary and useful to (a) reuse , link and merge other language or terminological resources; and (b) build them from scratch. They describe also how these hierarchies should be systematically evaluated in order to identify terminological gaps and fill them. Besides, t hey pr ovide some useful hints to name and annotate ont ology concepts with their designating terms and definitions , both in monolingual and multilingual environments . Overall, they provide a sound basis for ontol o-gies to be use d as terminology managers , which is one of the possible ways in which ontological and terminological research works might con-verge in the future.
