In a typical session, experts interact with DSSs to: (A) formulate a query in the KB domain; (B) translate the query into the KB formalism; (C) implement the response retrieval; (D) build the response ef fi ciently; (E) communicate the response(s) and/or suggest improvements, and wait for user feedback. attributes is instantiated. A closed query is a speci fi c and well-de information. An open query is less speci fi c, as it includes attribute values that are unde expensive to obtain or they are unreliable. Martinez et al.

 Let us take the fi rst decision table concerning the HT decision. It contains four attributes ( with the following con fi gurations:

There are many possible alternatives, where users will close known responses or by having the user intervene at some steps to reduce response uncertainty. 1.3.

With a discrete domains, a decision table can be viewed as a multidimensional matrix. cell of the table of n +1 attributes with index c = c 0 ; where q is the c -offset with respect to the fi rst element of the table in a given base, and D attribute domain for i =0,1, ... , n .

The open query is OQ The S table consists of seven attributes: the HT table attributes that we used before, plus decision GHS and CP . Therefore, the non-instantiated attributes in this open query are fi ve variables ( CS , BD , HP , HC , and HT ) are not connected to the

We are already at Step S3 , and S =None is the mode of the previous distribution, which is chosen as m
At Step S4 we propagate this new value as evidence, computing the probability of each attribute given m shown in Fig. 3 (left-hand side). The probability distributions are updated from (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) for to (0.2870, 0.2856, 0.4274) for GHS and (0.1440, 0.2857, 0.2848, 0.2855) for smaller than the variance of GHS which is 0.0066. Its mode is At Step S5 , vector X 0 is extended with a new dimension given by the evidence given by X 1 . This probability distribution is 0.6648 and 0.3352 for the values =None is the mode of the previous distribution, which is chosen as m We propagate this new value as evidence, computing the probability of hand side).

Vector X 1 is extended with a new dimension given by the GHS dialogue continues asking the expert whether she believes that the patient has GHS =Average and GHS =Good, then the network would suggest that surgery should not be performed (not shown). In short, when HP =Absent, BD =Yes and CS =I, the DSS suggests that surgery should not be performed unless where curative surgery would be mandatory. This is what we learn from this dialog. 4.4.
