The contributions of this paper are as follows. Corresponding to the weighted lower and show that many properties of variance and covariance in probability theory are preserved by the proposed notions. We will also propose the weighted lower and upper possibilistic mean X  X ariance models for portfolio selection and the notions of the weighted lower and our methods. 2 Weighted lower and upper possibilistic means and variances Let us introduce some definitions, which we need in the following section. A fuzzy number A is a fuzzy set of the real line R with a normal, fuzzy convex and continuous membership function of bounded support. The family of fuzzy numbers is denoted by F .
Carlsson and Full X r [ 3 ] defined the lower and upper possibilistic mean values of fuzzy number A with  X  -level set [ A ]  X  =[ a 1 ( X  ), a 2 ( X  ) ] ( X  &gt; 0 ) as and where Pos denotes possibility, i.e.,
Corresponding to the lower and upper possibilistic means, Zhang and Nie [ 33 ]defined the lower and upper possibilistic variances and covariances of fuzzy numbers as ances and covariances as and alternatively
Different from the above method, Zhang et al. [ 31 ] proposed the new crisp possibilistic variance and covariance as upper possibilistic means of fuzzy number A with [ A ]  X  =[ a 1 ( X  ), a 2 ( X  ) ] as and following normalization condition 1 0 f ( X  ) d  X  = 1[ 15 ]. If f ( X  ) = 2  X , X   X  X  0 , 1 ] ,then
Clearly, the weighted lower and upper possibilistic means can be considered as a gener-the definitions of weighted lower and upper possibilistic means.

 According to Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 , we easily deduce Theorem 2.1 .
 Theorem 2.1 Let A i  X  F and let  X , X  i  X  R ,i = 1 , 2 ,..., n. Then where  X ( x ) is a sign function of x  X  R .

Corresponding with the weighted lower and upper possibilistic means, we now define the weighted lower and upper possibilistic variances of fuzzy number A with [ A ]  X  = [ a ( X  ), a 2 ( X  ) ] as and respectively.

 Remark 2.1 TheweightedlowerpossibilisticvarianceVar f  X  ( A ) describestheweightedaver-variances can be interpreted and computed in a similar manner as in probability theory. We define the weighted lower and upper possibilistic covariances between fuzzy numbers and Clearly, Cov f  X  ( A , A ) = Var f  X  ( A ) and Cov  X  f ( A , A ) = Var  X  f ( A ) . Furthermore, we have the following results by [ 5 , 16 ] and where we have used the relationships The weighted lower possibilistic covariance can be reformulated as and the weighted upper possibilistic covariance can be reformulated as interpreted and computed in a similar manner as in probability theory.
Lemma 2.3 can directly be proved from the definitions of the weighted lower and upper possibilistic variances.
 Lemma 2.3 Let A  X  F and let  X   X  R .Then and
Theorem 2.2 shows that the weighted lower and upper possibilistic variances of linear combination of fuzzy numbers can easily be computed like in probability theory. Theorem 2.2 Let A , B  X  F and  X ,  X ,  X   X  R , and let f be a weighted function. Then where  X ( x ) is a sign function of x  X  R . Suppose  X &lt; 0and  X &lt; 0. Then We obtain where Similar reasoning holds for the case  X   X  0and  X   X  0 .
 Suppose now that  X &gt; 0and  X &lt; 0. Then We get This conclusion also holds for the case  X &lt; 0and  X   X  0 .
 Therefore, for any  X ,  X   X  R , Using the same may as above, it follows that which ends the proof.
 Theorem 2.3 obviously holds by Theorem 2.2 .
 Theorem 2.3 Let A i  X  F and let  X , X  i  X  R ,i = 1 , 2 ,..., n, and let f be a weighted function. Then where  X ( x ) is a sign function of x  X  R .

 The following theorem shows that both Cov f  X  and Cov  X  f are nonnegative definite. Cov f  X  and Cov  X  f , are nonnegative definite matrices.
 Proof It follows by the definition of weighted lower possibilistic covariance that Therefore, Cov f  X  is a real symmetric matrix.
 Let [ A i ]  X  =[ a i 1 ( X  ), a i 2 ( X  ) ] , i = 1 ,..., n . Then for any t i  X  R , i = 1 ,..., n , it follows that This concludes the proof of the theorem.
 In particular, the following result is true for symmetric fuzzy numbers. s weighted function. Then Proof According to the definitions of M f  X  and M  X  f , we easily get and where and therefore, for all i , j = 1 ,..., n . Thus, Cov f  X  = Cov  X  f .
 This ends the proof of theorem. 3 Possibilistic approaches to selecting portfolio notations:

The factor of 0.005 is a scaling convention that allows us to express the expected mulated the portfolio selection model with lower and upper bounds on risky asset holdings by using the possibilistic variance Var (  X  ) as ing portfolio selection problem by using the possibilistic variance Var ( A ) min Var s.t .
In the following selection, we propose the weighted lower and upper possibilistic mean X  weighted function. A  X  -level of r j is computed by Then we easily obtain and where E f = 1 0 f ( X  ) X  d  X  .
 Furthermore, and where D f = 1 0 f ( X  )( E f  X   X ) 2 d  X  .

By Theorem 2.3 , the weighted lower and upper possibilistic variances of r are, respec-tively, expressed by and for all x j  X  0 , j = 1 , 2 ,..., n .

Analogous to Markowitz X  X  mean X  X ariance methodology for the portfolio selection prob-lem, the weighted lower and upper possibilistic means correspond to the return, while the can be formulated as mulated as where 1  X  u i  X  l i  X  0and possibilistic efficient portfolios and efficient frontiers as follows. possibilistic efficient frontiers are derived explicitly, respectively.
It should be noted that Markowitz X  X  mean X  X ariance model and possibilistic mean X  X ari-model is based on probability distributions, uncertainty is equated with randomness. That probability theory is one of the main tools used for analyzing uncertainty in finance, it cannot describe uncertainty completely since there are some other uncertain factors that differ form the random ones found in financial markets. The weighted lower and upper possibilistic mean X  X ariance models are based on possibility distributions (fuzzy member-weighted average aggregation of the cuts of the return to be regarded as a fuzzy number according to the preference of a decision maker. Under different weighted functions, the imation of the return consistent with their preference information.

Here we only offer a simple method to determine the triangu-[ d calculated by the following formula: calculate the frequency of monthly return rates from October 2002 to April 2007. Table 1 as the minimum possible value and the maximum possible value of uncertain return rates, of five stocks as follows: upper bounds of x i are given by and respectively.
 Let the weighted function f ( X  ) = 2  X , X   X  X  0 , 1 ] [ 4 ]. Then Thus, the lower and upper possibilistic portfolio models are, respectively, given by and 0 . 3 , 0 . 1  X  x 4  X  0 . 3 , 0 . 1  X  x 5  X  0 . 4 , x 1 + x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + x 5  X  1 } . portfolio obtained, more portfolios can be obtained by varying the value of  X  .

We present the weighted lower and upper possibilistic ear programming problems under the assumption that the returns of assets are trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. We also offer a useful method to determine the possibility distribution of return and a real numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. References Author Biographies
