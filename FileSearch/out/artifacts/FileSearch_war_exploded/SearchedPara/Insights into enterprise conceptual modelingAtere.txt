 1. Introduction
Conceptual modeling is de fi ned as the process of formally documenting a problem domain for the purpose of understanding empirical study into the nature of the conceptual models used in practice. Traditionally, it is acknowledged that all conceptual models are used to develop, acquire, or modify information systems conceptual models that focus on the business/enterprise domain rather than the traditional information systems domain. the nature of business stakeholders' practice. Speci fi cally we try to answer the following questions:  X 
For which tasks do practitioners use conceptual models?  X 
What types of conceptual models do practitioners use while undertaking each task?  X  What level of complexity do conceptual models demonstrate?  X 
What types of methods/guidance do practitioners use to support their conceptual models?  X  How can business stakeholders distinguish drawings from conceptual models? increase knowledge transfer effectiveness. We demonstrate how tool vendors can automate artifacts and models pro enterprise conceptual models we suggest tool vendors certain features such as context-awareness, method guidance and complexity assessment which will increase the usability of conceptual modeling tools.

They described the principal tools and techniques, and the purposes for which which are either dated (done in the late 1980s), focused on system development, or limited to interviews [10].

To further understand the nature of their day-to-day work and the artifacts they produce, we sent an appeal to the broad day practice by collecting a large number of  X  home grown be reused in many engagements. We got around 60 actual requests to participate in the experiment, with approximately 70 from other divisions across the company. Interestingly, they were also geographically distributed as follows: 44% of the participants were located in the USA, 14% in UK, and all the rest scattered over the globe. choice to focus on graphic models, although some of the participants sent us text documents and MS-Excel replaced with neutral text for the sake of con fi dentiality. Therefore it should be noted that these abstract syntax [2] of the models and the text is only illustrative.

Our sample shows that artifacts can be grouped according to the following formality levels:  X 
Unstructured diagrams  X  drawings  X 
Semi-structured diagrams  X  X  home grown  X  conceptual models  X 
Fully structured diagrams  X  standards or  X  known methods  X  and structural constraints like Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) [6].

At these stages conceptual model authors gather information, even shape subsequent phases where standards are more applicable. As opposed to industrial standards, semi-structured diagrams offer practitioners fl exibility. They promote principles such as delayed commitment to syntax, unconstrained cannot be found in traditional modeling tools which support standards and industrial standards. sample, 73 (39%) of the diagrams were drawings and 5 (3%) work products were based on standards. The signi semi-structured diagrams probably stems from the fact that we deliberately asked for likely to be reused across engagements. In this article, we focus on the characteristics of the comparing them to drawings and standards. Semi-structured models can evolve to standards using [11]. Semi-structured models are the natural fi t to this type of tools.

What level of complexity do conceptual models demonstrate? Analysts often strike a balance between simplicity and complexity when communicating information system requirements. concerned with to understand and communicate aspects of a complex domain in a simple manner. Consequently, conceptual project implications from the task at hand to the complexity of the required conceptual model. 4.3.1. Single vs. multi-grammar
Wand and Weber [25] claim that most grammars do not provide a suf domain. Even if a grammar can model all phenomena equally well, the cognitive demand placed on users is too high.
Consequently, multiple grammars arise from the need to model the domain completely. Table 5 includes our analysis of the number of grammars per conceptual model used in enterprise conceptual models. grammar conceptual models artifact.
 According to our sample, the average number of grammars per conceptual model is 2.14 with a standard deviation of 2.3. plurality of the artifacts that make up our sample. Our corollary from this conceptual models that are not complex, and when there is a need for multiple grammars this need is usually satis grammars per artifact. The next discussion deals with the cases when multiple grammars are involved. Our analysis shows that when enterprise conceptual models use multiple grammars, they do it for the following reasons: represent zooming-in or a decomposition of segments from previous diagrams. The relationships between elements of different diagrams should be maintained.

He goes from a static view of the competencies always present in the business, to a focus on business functions and services these functions require from example was taken from an artifact that decomposes 21 domains; such a level of expressiveness requires the use of multi-grammar conceptual model.

Combination of static and dynamic views  X  diagrams can be seen as viewpoints of the model, where the conceptual model starts with a static structure and the following structures offer behavioral aspects. of view. Fig 5 shows an example of a multi-grammar method that is motivated from the desire to express complicated ideas.

What types of methods/guidance do practitioners use to support their conceptual models?
Several scholars have addressed the topic of conceptual modeling methods. According to Wyssusek et al.

We next present our existence of method for grammar (i.e. method for describing how to use the constructs de enable stakeholders to identify the phenomena to be modeled.

In summary, it appears that our sample adheres to the claims noted above regarding the scarcity of methods explaining the the conceptual model grammar ranging from legends to full documentation as seen in Figs. 7 and 8 . models, we examined the phenomena method for single/multiple grammar [25] that designates whether the conceptual model method provided guidance on what real-world phenomena the conceptual model is intended to model and how to map those phenomena to the model constructs.

Table 9 clearly indicates that most of the multi-grammar conceptual models were obtained with such phenomena about the necessity to provide guidance for the right phenomena identi compensate for the lack of detailed grammar construct speci work is more focused on the business problem at hand than on the methods' constructs and correct grammar. 4.5. How can business stakeholders distinguish drawings from conceptual models? users [21]. Knowledge transfer is considered to be more than just a communication problem. If it were merely that, then a memorandum, e-mail, or meeting would accomplish the knowledge transfer. the following reasons: A. Knowledge resides in organizational members, tools, tasks, and their sub networks [3]. B. Much important for the organization to understand whether the artifact contains conceptual models that are reusable or merely drawings. This is especially true in light of the template reuse across engagements, which was found so prominent in the from them the conceptual models for further use can enable organizations to manage this knowledge transfer problem.
For various business stakeholders, drawings serve to convey thoughts. These diagrams are created to communicate a models: grammar and method [25]. As noted, we identi fi ed 73 of 186 diagrams as merely drawings to distinguish a conceptual model from a drawing. We identi conceptual model or not: constructs of the diagram, and a way of using them in the business circumstances, then they suggest that the diagram is a conceptual model.

We investigated some major aspects of enterprise conceptual modeling through an empirical analysis over real-world work business stakeholders practice.

We began by examining the context of the conceptual models in our sample, which yielded the result that organizational context, with some families more typically used for certain tasks than others.

Moreover, by providing context one can anticipate which kind of conceptual model they might need grammar, or a more complex (multi-grammar) one. We used the number of grammars as a measure of the complexity for the conceptual model, then analyzed the reasons for using multi-grammars, forti
A large proportion of the conceptual models were accompanied by methods for phenomena. We assert that the complexity of multi-grammar conceptual models resulted in the need to provide guidance for the right phenomena identi model grammar.
