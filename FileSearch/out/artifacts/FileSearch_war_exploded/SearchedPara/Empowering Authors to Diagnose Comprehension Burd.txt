 Good textbooks are organized in a systematically progres-sive fashion so that students acquire new knowledge and learn new concepts based on known items of information. We provide a diagnostic tool for quantitatively assessing the comprehension burden that a textbook imposes on the reader due to non-sequential presentation of concepts. We present a formal definition of comprehension burden and propose an algorithmic approach for computing it. We ap-ply the tool to a corpus of high school textbooks from India and empirically examine its effectiveness in helping authors identify sections of textbooks that can benefit from reorga-nizing the material presented.

Education is known to be a key determinant of economic growth and prosperity [19, 41]. While the issues in devis-ing a high-quality educational system are multi-faceted and complex, textbooks are acknowledged to be the educational input most consistently associated with gains in student learning [36]. Textbooks are the primary conduits for de-livering content knowledge to the students and the teachers

 base their lesson plans primarily on the material given in textbooks [14].

Considerable research has gone into investigating what makes for good textbooks [11, 15, 20, 27, 40]. There has also been work on designing ideal textbook and guidelines and checklists have been proposed for assessing the quality of a textbook [5, 8, 31]. Most education researchers concur that the good textbooks are organized in a systematically progressive fashion so that students acquire new knowledge and learn new concepts based on known items of informa-tion [4, 23, 31]. Unfortunately, many textbooks suffer from what Harriet Tyson-Bernstein calls the  X  X entioning X  prob-lem [35] that causes concepts to be encountered before they have been adequately explained and forces students to ran-domly  X  X nock around X  in the book [8]. Indeed, the exten-sive survey in [6] reports a number of empirical studies in which learning from textbooks was successfully improved by rewriting the text to enhance comprehension.

We propose a diagnostic tool for authors to enable them to mine the content of a textbook to quantitatively assess the comprehension burden that a particular organization of the textbook can impose on the reader due to non-sequential presentation of concepts. A textbook with large comprehen-sion burden makes it harder for the reader to understand the textbook material. We introduce the notion of com-prehension burden, present a formal definition, and provide an algorithmic approach for computing it. We evaluate the proposed methodology over a corpus of Indian textbooks that demonstrates its effectiveness for identifying sections of textbooks that can benefit from reorganizing the mate-rial presented.

The layout of the rest of the paper is as follows. We be-gin with a discussion of related work in  X  2. We present key properties followed in well-written textbooks and provide a formal definition of comprehension burden based on these properties in  X  3. We also describe the algorithm for comput-ing the comprehension burden in this section. We present the experimental results in  X  4 and conclude with a summary and directions for future work in  X  5.
The question of what factors influence understandability of a text has intrigued researchers for a long time. An early comprehensive investigation, dating back to 1935 [16], iden-tified two principal sets of factors. The first set pertains to individual differences amongst readers, such as levels of intellectual capacity, reading skills, attitudes and goals, pre-vious experiences, and personal interests and tastes. The second set relates to the readability of the material, which i n turn depends on format (page layout, appearance, etc.), organization (headings, indexes, flow, etc.), style (linguistic structural elements, tone of the writer, etc.), and content (theme, nature of the subject matter, etc.). Much of the readability research has focused on the style category be-cause of perceived relative importance of stylistic variables and the fact that stylistic variables are easier to operational-ize [18].

We refer the reader to the survey in [12] for overview of readability research. Sherman is considered to be the first to use statistical analysis for analyzing readability in 1890 X  X . By counting average sentence length, he showed how sentence-length averages had shortened over time [32]. The first readability formula, a weighted index of vocab-ulary complexity, is attributed to the work of Lively and Pressley in 1923 [24]. Since then over two hundred formulas have been developed for measuring the difficulty of reading. Some popular formulas include Flesch Reading Ease Score, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Dale-Chall Grade Level, Gun-ning Fog Index, SMOG Index, Coleman-Liau Index, and Au-tomated Readability Index. The readability formulas have come under criticism because of their purported low valid-ity from the perspective of psycholinguistic theories [7] and there have been efforts to develop new approaches for pre-dicting reading difficulty, for example, by using statistical language modeling techniques and linguistic features [10, 22] and by devising domain-specific readability measures [42]. While this body of readability research can be used to as-sess the reading complexity of a piece of text in isolation, our focus is on studying the organization and presentation of concepts in the entire textbook.

In linguistics, cohesion refers to connections between sen-tences, whereas coherence refers to the connectedness of the ideas [39]. Cohesion provides a sense of flow from sentence to sentence and the principle of cohesion states that one must start a sentence with old information and end it with new information. The principle of coherence states that to make a series of individual sentences into a coherent passage, one must focus the topics of those sentences on a limited number of concepts. Discourse parsing techniques are used to build a structural representation of a text which reflects the se-mantic relationships among basic textual units [17, 25, 29, 33]. We build upon these ideas in our definition of com-prehension burden, where we focus on flow from concept to concept.

The cognitive load theory proposes that poorly designed instructional materials place cognitive overload on learn-ers as working memory is limited. This cognitive overload impairs schema acquisition, later resulting in a lower per-formance [26, 28]. The theory distinguishes between three types of load: intrinsic, extraneous and germane. Intrinsic load is a function of the complexity of the content rather than instructional design. Extraneous load on the other hand is not inherent within the content, but depends on how the instructional designer has structured and presented information. Intrinsic and extraneous loads are additive. Germane load is the remaining free capacity in working memory that may be directed toward schema acquisition. Thus, a well-designed book increases the learning capacity of a learner. We make use of these ideas in abstracting the properties of well-written books.

In [2], a probabilistic decision model has been proposed for identifying those sections of a textbook that are not well-written. The decision model is based on the syntactic com-plexity of the writing and the notion of the dispersion of key concepts mentioned in the section. However, each section is treated independently and the flow of writing across dif-ferent sections is not taken into account. By contrast, the focus of the present paper is on determining whether the entire textbook is organized in a systematically progressive fashion.
We begin by enunciating properties of well-written text-books abstracted from education literature. We then de-scribe our model of a textbook and how a poorly written book can impose comprehension burden on the reader. Fi-nally, after introducing some notations used in the paper, we formally define comprehension burden of a textbook.
Property 3.1 (Focus). Each section in a well-written textbook explains very few concepts.
Property 3.2 (Unity). For each concept in a well-written textbook, there is a unique section that best explains the concept.

The properties of Focus and Unity are rooted in the following notion: a text that is more unified and addresses a single purpose results in better comprehension [4, 8, 16, 23, 39]. The cognitive load theory also proposes that in-trinsic load may be reduced by dividing an instruction into smaller pieces and that if learners process the individual el-ements of instruction serially, rather than simultaneously, they are able to process the instruction more efficiently [9, 30]. In fact, Alfred North Whitehead admonished way back in 1917:  X  X hat you teach, teach thoroughly, seizing on the few general ideas which illuminate the whole, and persis-tently marshalling subsidiary facts around them X  [38].
Property 3.3 (Sequentiality). Concepts in a well-written textbook are discussed in a sequential fashion, that is, a concept is adequately explained prior to occurrences of this concept or any related concept.

This property stems from the following insights: (a) good textbooks should be organized in a systematically progres-sive fashion [4, 31] (b) a well-designed book can reduce extra-neous cognitive load and thus increase the learning capacity of a student [26, 28].
Property 3.4 (Prioritization). In a well-written text-book, the tie for precedence in presentation between two mu-tually related concepts is broken in favor of the more signif-icant of the two.
Although a well-written textbook strives to present the c oncepts in a sequential fashion, two mutually related con-cepts may vie to have precedence in the order of their pre-sentation. A good book will break the tie in favor of the concept that is more significant [23].
Although textbooks are typically organized into chapters which are subdivided into logical sections, for the purposes of this paper, we find it sufficient to model a textbook sim-ply as a sequence of sections. Assume that the textbook has been written in such a way that each section explains one or very few concepts, that is, each of these concepts is discussed in depth (Property 3.1). But a section can also mention other concepts, that is, each of these concepts is referenced but not explained in detail. For each concept, there is a key section in the book that best explains it (Property 3.2). Thus a reader who has gone through the key section corre-sponding to a concept has comprehended the concept, while a reader who has not yet read the key section has a vague comprehension of the concept. A concept could be related to other concepts, and hence significant for understanding other concepts.

A textbook imposes comprehension burden on the reader if the concepts are not presented in a sequential fashion. In particular, for a concept c , an occurrence of a related con-cept d in a section preceding the key section for c imposes comprehension burden on the reader since the reader has not comprehended c yet and hence faces difficulty in under-standing d . Note that d could be same as c , in which case the comprehension burden is imposed on the reader who en-counters a mention of c in an earlier section whereas c has been explained properly in a later section (Property 3.3).
Suppose the reader encounters d in section i prior to ex-planation of c in its key section k c . The more significant the explanation of c in the section k c is for understanding other concepts in the book, the greater chance the reader cannot understand d in section i without thoroughly understanding c and hence larger the comprehension burden on the reader while reading section i . Further, the more significant d in section i is for understanding other concepts in the book, the larger is the comprehension burden since the reader may not be able to follow subsequent material that is based on the discussion of d in section i (Property 3.4).

For illustration, consider a book consisting of three sec-tions, each of which contains three mutually related con-cepts, c 1 , c 2 and c 3 . Unity demands that each concept has a unique key section where it is explained. Focus requires that a section explains very few concepts. Assume that a section can be the key section for only one concept. Suppose that c 1 is the most significant and c 3 is the least significant of the three. Prioritization implies that the author will explain c 1 in section 1, followed by c 2 in section 2, and finally c in section 3. Concept c 1 obeys Sequentiality but not the other two. Its mention in any of the later sections does not incur comprehension burden as the reader has by now comprehended it. A mention of c 2 in section 1 will incur comprehension burden as it is explained only in section 2. However, its mention in section 3 will not incur comprehen-sion burden. Similarly, any mention of c 3 in a section earlier than section 3 will incur comprehension burden.

As the above example demonstrates, there is a trade-off to be made since the properties interact with each other. In t he extreme, a book that consists of a single long section violates Focus completely while satisfying the other three. Clearly, this organization is not acceptable. Typically the author faces the task of explaining certain mutually related concepts in a book. As all of them cannot be presented in the same section due to the requirement of Focus , Se-quentiality needs to be violated and hence comprehension burden cannot be entirely avoided. However, different orga-nizations can result in different amounts of comprehension burden, which points to the necessity of being able to quan-tify the comprehension burden due to a given organization of a textbook. We assume that the author first tries to satisfy Focus and Unity as much as possible.
Before formally defining comprehension burden, we intro-duce some notations. Let S = { 1 , 2 ,...,n } denote the set of sections in a given textbook. Let C denote the set of con-cepts in the book. For each concept c  X  C , let k c denote the key section for understanding the concept. For each concept c  X  C , denote the set of concepts related to it by R ( c ). Note that R ( c ) includes c . Let  X  ( c,i ) denote the significance score of concept c in section i for understanding other concepts in the entire book.

Let d  X  R ( c ) be a concept related to c . We denote by  X  (( d,i )  X  c ) the comprehension burden imposed on the reader while reading about d in section i due to c being necessary for understanding d but c being explained in a later section in the book. We say that  X  (( d,i )  X  c ) is the comprehension burden for concept d in section i attributed to concept c . Similarly, denote the comprehension burden for concept d attributed to concept c over all sections by  X  ( d  X  c ), the comprehension burden on all concepts at-tributed to concept c by  X ( c ), the comprehension burden of section i by  X   X ( i ), and the total comprehension burden of the textbook by B . Table 1 summarizes key notations.
We now present the formal definition of comprehension burden for a given textbook, assuming that the book satisfies the Focus and Unity properties.

Definition 3.5. 1. Given a concept c  X  C with key 2. Given a concept c  X  C and a concept d  X  R ( c ) , define 3. Define the comprehension burden attributed to con-4. Define the comprehension burden of section i  X  S as 5. Define the comprehension burden of the textbook as
The key aspect of Definition 3.5 is to quantify  X  (( d,i )  X  c ). Occurrence of d in k c or a section following it does not impose any comprehension burden on the reader since the reader would have understood c before encountering d , and hence  X  (( d,i )  X  c ) is non-zero only when i &lt; k c . See Fig. 1 for an illustration. Figure 1: Illustration of comprehension burden: C oncept c is explained in section 3 ( k c = 3 ) and is also mentioned in sections 1 and 4. A related con-cept d occurs in sections 2 and 4. As c is explained in section 3, the reader incurs comprehension burden when reading about c in section 1 (  X  (( c, 1)  X  c ) &gt; 0 ) and about d in section 2 (  X  (( d, 2)  X  c ) &gt; 0 ), but not in section 4 when encountering c and d (  X  (( c, 4)  X  c ) =  X  (( d, 4)  X  c ) = 0 ).

Burden  X  (( d,i )  X  c ) depends monotonically on the sig-nificance score of concept d in section i and the significance score of concept c in section k c , and has been expressed as a monotonically increasing function f (  X  ( d,i ) , X  ( c,k the reader incurs comprehension burden every time she en-counters an occurrence of d in a section prior to k c , we sum  X  (( d,i )  X  c ) over all sections to obtain  X  ( d  X  c ). The comprehension burden attributed to concept c ,  X ( c ) is ob-tained by summing  X  ( d  X  c ) over all concepts related to c . The comprehension burden of section i ,  X   X ( i ) is obtained by summing  X  (( d,i )  X  c ) over all concepts that d is related to and then over all concepts in section i . The comprehension burden of the textbook is obtained by summing the compre-hension burden attributed to each concept, or equivalently by summing the comprehension burden of each section.
The requirement on f in Definition 3.5 stems from Pri-oritization property.

Claim 3.6. Prioritization implies that f ( x,y ) &lt; f ( y,x ) whenever x &gt; y .

Proof. Consider two organizations of a book differing in just the order of presentation of two mutually related con-cepts c and d . In the first version, c is explained in section i with significance score  X  c and d is explained in a later section j with significance score  X  d , where  X  c &gt;  X  d . In the second version, the positions of c and d are interchanged. The first version obeys Prioritization while the second violates it. Hence the second version should impose larger comprehen-sion burden on the reader. For the first version,  X  ( d  X  c ) = 0 and  X  ( c  X  d ) = f (  X  c , X  d ) so that the total comprehen-sion burden is f (  X  c , X  d ). Similarly the total comprehension burden for the second version is f (  X  d , X  c ). Thus, the re-quirement is that f (  X  c , X  d ) &lt; f (  X  d , X  c ) whenever  X  In other words, f should satisfy f ( x,y ) &lt; f ( y,x ) whenever x &gt; y .
 We next show that a broad category of simple functions can s atisfy the above requirement.

Claim 3.7. Suppose f is defined as the product of two univariate functions on either input: f ( x,y ) = g ( x )  X  h ( y ) . Then the characterization of f in Definition 3.5 is satisfied if g ( . ) and h ( . ) are monotonically increasing functions and h ( x ) /g ( x ) is also a monotonically increasing function. The claim follows since (a) g and h are monotonically in-creasing  X  f is monotonically increasing (b) x &gt; y  X  ently, the requirement above is that h ( . ) grows faster than g ( . ), or equivalently the significance score of concept c in sec-tion k c is weighed more than the significance score of concept d in the earlier section i in the computation of  X  (( d,i )  X  c ). For example, g ( x ) = 1 and h ( x ) = x is a valid choice that takes only  X  ( c,k c ) into account, ignoring  X  ( d,i ). 1. We use summation to define  X ( c ) and B , but in gen-2. Suppose the book does not satisfy Unity , so that the 3. F ocus does not figure in the definition of comprehen-
Computation of comprehension burden of a textbook us-ing Definition 3.5 requires the following inputs: (i) concepts in the book, (ii) relationship between concepts, (iii) the sig-nificance score for each concept in each section, and (iv) the key section for every concept. We describe next the compu-tation of each of these inputs.
Following [3, 21], we define concept phrases to be termi-nological noun phrases. We first form a candidate set of phrases using linguistic patterns, with the help of a part-of-speech tagger [34]. We adopt the pattern A  X  N + , where A refers to an adjective and N a noun, which was found to be particularly effective in identifying concept phrases. Exam-ples of phrases satisfying this pattern include  X  X umulative distribution function X ,  X  X iscal policy X , and  X  X lectromagnetic radiation X . The initial set of phrases is further refined by ex-ploiting complementary signals from different sources. First, WordNet [13], a lexical database is used to correct errors made by the part-of-speech tagger. Next, both malformed phrases and very common phrases are eliminated, based on the probabilities of occurrences of these phrases on the Web, obtained using Microsoft Web N-gram Service [37]. The rea-son for eliminating common phrases is that they would be already well understood.
We first attempted to induce relationships between con-cepts by mapping concept phrases to Wikipedia articles and use the link structure between the Wikipedia articles to in-fer relationship between concepts. We discovered the fol-lowing issues. Many Wikipedia articles have asymmetric hyperlink structure, plausibly due the encyclopedic nature of Wikipedia: there are relatively less links from articles on specialized topics to articles on more general topics. For in-stance, the Wikipedia article titled  X  X aussian surface X  men-tions  X  X lectric field X  11 times but does not have a link to the latter. Furthermore, while Wikipedia provides good cov-erage for universal subjects like Physics and Mathematics, it has inadequate coverage for concepts related to locale-dependent subjects such as History.

We, therefore, derive the relationship between concepts di-rectly from textbooks using co-occurrence. More precisely, we defined R ( c ) to be the set of concepts (including c ) that co-occur with c in at least e sections such that both c and the co-occurring concept c  X  occur within a window of size l in each of these e sections. The requirements of co-occurrence in multiple sections and co-occurrence within a window size ensure that we only consider concept pairs that are signifi-cantly related to each other. Our implementation sets e = 2 and l = 500 words.
The significance score  X  ( c,i ) is a measure of how signif-icant is the description of concept c in section i for under-standing other concepts in the book. One possible approach would be to define the significance score in terms of the relative frequency of the concept phrase in the section, for example,  X  ( c,i ) := ( freq ( c,i )) / ( P 1  X  i  X  n P c  X  C A problem with such a definition is that it does not dif-ferentiate between two concept phrases c 1 and c 2 with the same frequency in a given section. However, concept c 1 may be related to many concepts that occur in other sections in the book and hence more significant for understanding the entire book, while c 2 may be relevant only for the cur-rent section. We, therefore, define the significance score of a concept phrase in a section taking into account: (a) how frequent is the concept in the section, and (b) how many concepts are related to it.

Definition 3.8. The significance score of a concept c in section i is defined as where  X  is a monotonically increasing function in two vari-ables.

Our implementation instantiates function  X  as interpretation that the significance score of a concept in a section is proportional to its frequency in the section as well as the number of concepts related to it.
We use the intuition that the key section for a concept will have high significance score for that concept. Thus, we algorithmically obtain the key section for a concept by comparing its significance scores in different sections. For each concept c  X  C , we set the key section for c to be With the significance score defined as in Definition 3.8, this choice is equivalent to selecting the section where the con-cept is most frequent.

We remark that multiple alternatives exist for computing the above inputs and our model of comprehension burden can admit multiple such choices. For example, the signifi-cance score computation can benefit by including anaphoric references to a concept when computing its frequency in a section.
We next present a diagnostic tool we have built based on the notions just introduced that allows an author to under-stand the sources of comprehension burden in a textbook. This tool helps authors accomplish the following goals: (1) identify and investigate sections with large burden, and (2) identify and probe concepts that impose large burden.
We studied the characteristics of our tool over a corpus of Indian high school textbooks published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). We selected this corpus because millions of students study from these books every year and these books were readily available online. We applied the tool to eleven books from grades IX X  X II, covering four broad subject areas: Sciences, Social Sciences, Commerce, and Mathematics. In [1], we Figure 2: Textbook overview page, with sections l isted in the decreasing order of burden. The num-ber within a slice indicates percentage of total bur-den for the corresponding section. Names of some of the sections have been omitted for clarity. described how to quantify the properties in  X  3.1 and mea-sured the extent to which these properties are followed in the above books. Here our focus is on measuring the com-prehension burden in these books.

In applying the tool, we instantiate function f as f (  X  ( d,i ) , X  ( c,k c )) :=  X  ( c,k c ) for computing comprehension burden. This choice satisfies the characterization of f in Definition 3.5 and has the interpretation that the compre-hension burden for concept d in section i attributed to c is proportional to the significance of c in its key section.
The author of a textbook might like to first determine sections where the readers incur large comprehension bur-den, so that she can prioritize such sections for revision. Hence our tool presents to the author an overview of the book with the sections ordered in the decreasing order of burden. Figure 2 illustrates this page for Grade XII Eco-nomics book. From this page, the author can observe that though this book consists of twenty five sections, 75% of the burden arises from just ten sections. Further, Section 4.1 titled  X  X x Ante and Ex Post X  has the largest burden.
Having identified a section with large burden, the author might next like to understand why the reader incurs large burden in the section. For this purpose, our tool allows nav-igation to a page created for each section. Figure 3 shows this page for the section,  X  X x Ante and Ex Post X . This page lists the concepts occurring in the section in the decreas-ing order of their burden. This page also helps the author to determine whether each of these concepts is explained or mentioned in the section, and for a concept that is men-tioned, whether it has been explained in an earlier section or a later section. Thus, the author can identify those concepts Figure 3: Section page. Concepts occurring in the s ection are shown in the decreasing order of their burden. Further, concepts that are explained in the section have light gray background color, con-cepts that are mentioned but explained in a later section have dark gray background, and concepts that are mentioned but have been explained earlier have white background. Names of some of the con-cepts have been omitted for clarity. that are mentioned in the section prior to their explanation in the book. For such a concept, the author may choose to include greater explanation in the current section or an earlier section where it occurs. The author can observe that the section  X  X x Ante and Ex Post X  contains a large num-ber of distinct concepts, of which only a small fraction is explained in this section. About half of the remaining have been explained in earlier sections but the remaining half are explained in later sections. Moreover, 75% of the burden for the section arises from half of the concepts.

Next the author may want to drill down to understand what causes burden for each of these concepts. For this pur-pose, our tool permits navigation to a separate page dedi-cated to each concept occurring in the section. This page provides the distribution of the significance score of the con-cept across different sections in the book. It also shows the related concepts needed for understanding this concept, in the decreasing order of burden they impose on this concept. Figure 4 shows the page for the concept  X  X ggregate demand X , which has the largest burden in the section,  X  X x Ante and Ex Post X . The author learns that this concept is mentioned in this section, prior to its explanation in a later section. Furthermore, the author sees that the large burden for  X  X g-gregate demand X  is caused by the presence of many related concepts (such as  X  X xchange rate X ,  X  X inal goods X  and  X  X overn-ment spending X ) that are explained only in later sections. F igure 4: Concept page for a section. (a) The distri-bution of significance scores of the concept  X  X ggre-gate demand X  across different sections is shown. (b) Related concepts are shown in the decreasing order of burden they impose on the concept  X  X ggregate demand X  in the section  X  X x Ante and Ex Post X .
The author may also examine the book along an orthog-onal dimension by investigating concepts that impose large burden across the book. Such diagnosis is beneficial since the author may choose to include a glossary of such con-cepts. For this purpose, our tool presents an analysis of the book with respect to concepts present in the book, ordered in the decreasing order of burden imposed by them. Figure 5 shows this analysis for Grade XII Economics book. The author can see that concepts such as  X  X ggregate demand X ,  X  X xchange rate X  and  X  X inal goods X  impose the largest burden on the reader, accounting for nearly 55% of the total burden in the book. Moreover, 80% of the burden is attributed to just 10% of the concepts.

For a high burden concept, the author might like to un-derstand its impact on related concepts. This information might help the author decide whether this concept should be explained in an early section in the book. Hence our tool lets the author navigate to a page for each concept, which lists the burden imposed by this concept on its related concepts. Figure 6 illustrates this page for the concept  X  X ggregate de-Figure 5: Textbook overview page, with concepts l isted in the decreasing order of burden imposed. Figure 6: Concept page for the book. Burden im-p osed by the concept  X  X ggregate demand X  on its re-lated concepts is shown. mand X . By probing into concepts related to this concept and their distribution across sections, the author can infer that the burden can be reduced by explaining  X  X ggregate demand X  in a section prior to occurrences of many of its related con-cepts.
We next present some comparative observations from ap-plying our tool to books belonging to three different sub-jects: Grade XII Economics, Grade X Science, and Grade XII History. These books also had different organizational structure. Figure 7 gives a statistical overview of the sec-tions in these books. It shows the distribution of burden across different sections in a book, as well as the distribu-tion of the number of concepts across different book sections. Note that the X-axis refers to the section number (ordered over the entire book) and that these books have different number of sections.

Grade XII History book consists of chapters covering dif-ferent periods of Indian history, ranging from 3000BC to the 20th century. Our manual inspection revealed that the last few chapters in this book pertain to interrelated topics such as British rule and Indian freedom struggle, while the chapters in the initial two thirds of the book mostly discuss disjoint time periods, and hence disjoint concepts. As a re-sult, the burden for this book arises from very few sections occurring in the last few chapters.

Grade X Science book consists of independent modules, corresponding to Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Environ-mental Sciences in that order. However certain concepts such as  X  X lectric current X  and  X  X arbon dioxide X  are shared across modules, and are mentioned in the Biology module prior to their explanation in later parts of the book. More-over, sections in the Biology module contain a large number of concepts. Consequently, the burden is concentrated in the initial part of the book.

By contrast, Grade XII Economics book pertains to the single theme of macroeconomics, with different sections shar-ing related concepts, and hence the burden is spread out across more sections. We also observe that sections with large burden tend to have a large number of concepts.
This paper represents our attempt to expand the scope of data mining by considering a new application area  X  mining textbooks for identifying sections and concepts that can ben-efit from reorganizing the material presented. Towards this goal, we introduced the notion of comprehension burden, presented a rigorous definition as well as an algorithm for computing it, and provided a diagnostic tool for authors to quantitatively assess the burden that a textbook imposes on the reader due to non-sequential presentation of concepts. We applied the tool to a corpus of high school textbooks, currently in active use in India. Using the tool, we were able to isolate high-burden sections and concepts.
The work presented here can be extended along several dimensions. One particularly important direction is to in-corporate the background knowledge of the reader in the def-inition and computation of comprehension burden. For in-stance, consider a textbook designed for a course in Physics for which an introductory course covering basic ideas from different sciences is prerequisite. In such a book, it is reason-able for the author to presume that a mention of Newton X  X  laws without explaining them will not impose comprehen-sion burden, but this assumption is invalid for Einstein X  X  theory of relativity. Similarly, authors may correctly men-tion concepts perceived to be part of the common knowl-edge of the target readers without explaining them. How should comprehension burden factor in such general knowl-edge? Another important direction is to explore the use of deeper text analysis to differentiate between bad mentions and mentions where the author has provided key idea and supplemented it with a reference to the section where the idea has been discussed in depth. It will also be interest-ing to investigate connections between comprehension bur-den and notions from cognitive psychology such as cognitive load and schema acquisition.

An obstacle we faced in our work was the lack of an estab-lished evaluation methodology for studying the performance of the proposed techniques. Ensuring objectivity and consis-tency across judges in the user studies are some challenges to be addressed in designing a direct measurement. Dis-counting externality and removing bias are some challenges to be addressed in designing an indirect measurement such as comparison of performance scores of students using good and bad versions of the same book.
