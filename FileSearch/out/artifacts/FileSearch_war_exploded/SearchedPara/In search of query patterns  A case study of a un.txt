 1. Introduction
The Internet and more specifically the Web has undoubtedly become the largest available repository of information. The increased reach of Web-based search has made information retrieval (IR) systems a global tool for information access ( Wolfram &amp; Xie, 2001 ). One problem however is that the content of most Web documents retrieved are often of suspect credibility and reliability ( Center for Communication Policy, 2003 ). In contrast, traditional bibliography IR systems such as online catalogs, which are often available in academic and public libraries, are perceived to be more authoritative ( Drabenstott &amp; Weller, 1996 ).
However, online catalogs have been criticized as being hard to use because their designs do not incorporate sufficient understanding of search behaviors ( Borgman, 1996 ). For example, Warren (2000) discovered that the general design of the Urica OPAC system hindered rather than helped users in the searching process.
Scrolling through large retrieval sets may be one of the causes of user frustration. While record ranking based on queries has been commonly adopted in IR systems, a successful search in any IR system is still dependent on its composition and query construction ( Borgman, 1996; Walkerdine &amp; Rodden, 2001 ). However, the ability of IR systems to analyze query terms and intelligently interpret a user X  X  actual information needs is still far from being perfect. For example, Large and Beheshti (1999) reported that users encounter many problems in choosing suitable search terms to represent their subject interests. There is thus a need to establish a closer working relationship between systems designers and users to develop useful IR systems.

The success of an IR system can be evaluated via a number of quantitative or qualitative methods ( Jansen, 2000; Spink, Bateman, &amp; Jansen, 1998 ). Transaction log analysis is an example of the quantitative approach that can lead to plausible conclusions about user search behaviors. The contents of transaction logs are usually formatted in fields to facilitate quantitative analysis ( Covey, 2002 ) and contain information about users X  search behaviors. This includes the characters entered by users, timestamps, search command identifiers, the number of hits and the responses from the IR system. The logs are thus able to reveal the queries executed and strategies employed by users. Transaction logs analysis avoids the problem of reliability of user responses or normality of searching behaviors when users know they are the subjects of investigation. These drawbacks are often encountered in interviews, questionnaires and observation research ( Bains, 1997 ).

The present study focuses on Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, with the goal of deter-mining if its OPAC system can help meet its users X  information needs. NTU, with over 1300 academic staff and 24,000 students, provides a wide-range of tertiary-level programs including engineering, information technol-ogy, the humanities, social sciences, and business. The NTU OPAC is the main access point to staff and stu-dents for meeting their information needs, and serves as an information gateway to a diverse range of resources maintained by the university. Types of resources range from books, journals, theses, databases and multimedia productions.

This study employs transaction log analysis to examine users X  search patterns with the aim of assessing the ability of the NTU OPAC in satisfying the collective (as opposed to individual) needs of its users ( Tague-Sutc-liffe, 1996 ). Transaction logs thus appear to be the most reasonable and non-intrusive means of collecting such information since the probability of obtaining results by chance is minimized ( Ke, Kwakkaelaar, Tai, &amp; Chen, 2002 ) when the data volume is large. In particular, we analyze the characteristics of the queries issued and the use of various search options. This includes information such as query length, use of Boolean operators and so on. In short, the two objectives of this research are To discover patterns in user search behaviors.
 To explore the reasons for search failure.
 To date, no systematic study has been done on the NTU OPAC and the present work is therefore timely.
The remainder of this paper is divided as follows. A review of related literature in Section 2 highlights the relationship between the present study and previous work done in digital libraries, Web-based IR systems and
OPAC systems. We then present our data set and our findings. The final section proposes recommendations in the light of our results and suggests opportunities for future work. 2. Related work 2.1. Transaction log analysis
Transaction log analysis has been widely used to study the interactions between IR systems and their users ( Jansen &amp; Pooch, 2000; Ke et al., 2002 ). Bysouth (1990) found that the search terms recorded in the logs were very useful for analysis. For example, the logs reveal information such as which search options were selected, which types of Boolean operators were used and how many terms were used. When all the information is pieced together, an idea of  X  X  X ow X  X  the search is carried out by the user emerges. On the other hand, transaction log analysis falls short of providing an understanding of user perceptions of their searches ( Griffiths, Hartley, transaction logs. Although such logs provide highly detailed information about how users interact with the system, they do not reveal users X  intentions or whether users are satisfied with the results ( Larson, 1991 ).
Nevertheless, researchers have creatively used the information available in these logs to overcome some of these limitations. For instance, Pu, Chuang, and Yang (2002) collected queries from different periods from three search engine logs to remove bias due to the effect of time and locality, and to ensure accuracy. Covey (2002) used IP address and domain names captured in the transaction logs to identify user demographics when user authentication data were unavailable. The interesting observations and conclusions drawn from analyz-ing transaction logs have therefore led researchers to continue using this approach to examine users X  query patterns. The following subsections present related work that examine query characteristics in different IR systems. 2.2. Query patterns Jones, Cunningham, McNab, and Boddie (2000) analyzed the transaction logs of the Computer Science
Technical Report Collections (CSTR) in the New Zealand Digital Library and found that the average number of search terms was 2.43 per query. This result was consistent with a transaction log analysis of ResearchIndex (RI), a digital library of computer science content, with a reported average of 2.32 terms per query ( Mahoui &amp;
Cunningham, 2001 ). Likewise, Wallace (1993) obtained an average query length of one to two terms per query among users in an OPAC system at the University of Colorado. Similar findings were obtained from the trans-action logs analysis of the Excite search engine. From an analysis of 51,473 queries, about 62.0% of queries contained one or two terms, giving an average of 2.21 terms ( Jansen, Spink, &amp; Saracevic, 2000 ).
It is often assumed that the correct use of search operators would increase the effectiveness of searches ( Eastman &amp; Jansen, 2003 ). Yet, the usage of operators is relatively low because users tend to use simple que-ries. Query complexity refers to query commands issued and includes the use of techniques such as stemming, phrase search, and Boolean operators ( Jansen &amp; Pooch, 2000 ). Moukdad and Large (2001) concluded that a high proportion of Web users do not utilize advanced search features and those who do frequently misunder-stand them. In their work, only 7.8% of the total queries submitted to WebCrawler used one or more Boolean operators but only 35.8% of the Boolean searches were correctly issued. Another study from Excite revealed that less than 10% of the total queries contained Boolean operators ( Jansen et al., 2000 ). Similar results have been found for digital libraries. For example, Mahoui and Cunningham (2001) found that only 37.6% of que-ries in RI used Boolean operators while this value was 32.9% for CSTR.

The use of advanced search features is also relatively low in OPACs even though many of these systems are feature rich. For example, a survey conducted on the features provided by OPACs in Tamil Nadu (India) revealed that 86.2% of the systems offered advanced search features in addition to the simple search option ( Babu &amp; Tamizhchelvan, 2003 ). These include options such as author, keyword, subject heading and title searches, plus many others. Nevertheless, users have been known to encounter difficulties in constructing effec-tive search strategies using these features. For example, Lombardo and Condic (2000) conducted a survey on the new release of the OPAC system at Oakland University and discovered that many of its users were unable to take advantage of more sophisticated search techniques because the features were not intuitive. A separate study of the University of Colorado OPAC also showed that only 8.7% of all queries used advanced search features ( Jansen &amp; Pooch, 2000 ). 2.3. Failure analysis
Search failures have been examined in numerous IR studies. Jones et al. (2000) defined a failed search as one that matches no documents in the collection, and found that 10.5% of queries in CSTR were failures. These failed searches included queries with zero terms, ranked queries and Boolean queries. An analysis of
Excite searches found that most failures were due to  X  X  X ncorrect use X  X   X  mistakes in the use of Boolean oper-ators, spaces and other operators that were not supported by the search engine ( Jansen et al., 2000 ). For exam-ple, 37% of  X  X  X ND NOT X  X  queries were incorrect, 32% of  X  X  X ND X  X  queries were misused and 26% of  X  X  X R X  X  queries contained errors. Another reason for failed searches was found in a study on the Mardigian and Lilly
Libraries OPAC ( Drabenstott &amp; Weller, 1996 ). Here, the reason was the lack of user perseverance. This con-clusion was obtained from post-search questionnaires which required users to rate whether their searches were successful or not. An analysis of the data showed that some of the supposedly unsuccessful searches were in fact useful ones that could lead users to their topic of interest. Due to a lack of perseverance however, these users chose to terminate their searches rather than look beyond the first screen full of results. 3. Data set
As discussed, a transaction log analysis was performed on the NTU Library OPAC. These logs provide detailed accounts of user activities which include authentication (login/logout), query operations, renewal requests and so on, with each activity translated into one record in the transaction log. In total, one semester X  X  (4.5 months) worth of records were obtained and these contained 641,991 queries, all of which were used for this work. Among the query records, the data extracted for analysis included search options used, number of terms per query, query terms and the number of records retrieved.
 We then proceeded to meet our two objectives by investigating the following issues: Average, minimum and maximum query length.
 Frequency and type of search options used.
 Frequency and types of Boolean operators used.
 Types of typographical errors.
 Relationship between search failure and search options.
 Relationship between search failure and Boolean operators.

Relationship between search failure and query length. 4. Findings and analyses
In this section, we highlight search patterns from the aspects of search options used, length of queries issued, Boolean operators used, and their relationship with search failure. 4.1. Default settings in the NTU OPAC
Since default settings within a system would affect the outcome of searches and how users conduct their search, we first present an overview of the NTU OPAC, its query interface and default search options.
Fig. 1 shows the NTU OPACs query interface which allows users to search for both the NTU library X  X  col-subject or keyword (see Section 3 of Fig. 1 ), with keyword search being the default if the user submitted a query by pressing the  X  X  X nter X  X  key on the keyboard. This option searches against all fields of a bibliographic record and is therefore useful for novice searchers or those unsure about their domains of interest. Users may also limit the search by language or material type (see Section 4 of Fig. 1 ) with the default being the most general  X  all languages and all material types.

Hildreth (1995b) argued that an online catalog system should never permit a user X  X  search attempt to fail to retrieve at least one bibliographic record for review and action. One way to achieve this is to conduct a broad search, and this is presumably the idea behind the NTU OPACs default search options, which were keyword search across all languages (e.g. Chinese and English) and all material types (books, journals, theses, computer files, maps, audio-visual and sound recording materials). Nevertheless, a hidden default was found within the system that appeared contradictory to this intended design. That is, when no Boolean operators were explicitly entered, the system assumed a phrase search, requiring terms to be entered in the same order as they appeared in the bibliographic records.

Apart from the occasional use of Boolean operators, there was little evidence shown in the transaction logs that users had changed these default settings to a more restricted search scope. This could be due to the fact that users were unsure about the type of material that would most likely contain the information they were looking for, and/or they would rather to be  X  X  X onservative X  X , preferring to view more records than receiving zero hits. This observation was consistent with a study on the New Zealand Digital Library (NZDL) in which users rarely changed the default settings for query options ( Jones et al., 2000 ). 4.2. Search options used Results indicate that the most commonly used search option for the NTU OPAC is the keyword search.
The use of keyword searches contributed to 68.9% of all queries while other options such as title, author and subject accounted for 16.5%, 8.2% and 6.4% of all searches respectively (see Table 1 columns (a) X (c)).
Three reasons could account for the popularity of keyword search. Firstly, keyword search was the default option if the user submitted a query by pressing the  X  X  X nter X  X  key on the keyboard. Secondly, keyword search is helpful when users are not clear about which resources they are looking for. Thirdly, the tip given on the
OPAC query page (see Fig. 1 ), suggesting that keyword searches will result in all indexed fields being searched, might have indirectly influenced users to select this option. The tip gives users the impression that keyword search is generally the easiest to perform as all indexed fields of a bibliographic record are searched.
Keyword search exceeded subject search by more than 10 times in the NTU OPAC. There were 442,523 keyword searches as compared to 41,048 subject searches. Unlike keyword search, terms used in subject search need to be matched exactly with subject headings. If matches did not occur, a terse  X  X  X tem not found X  X  message would be displayed, giving no contextual help to assist in further query refinement. Previous work has shown that there was a consistent decline of subject searching in large OPAC systems. For example, the regression model built by Larson (1991) indicated that the percentage of subject searching in the University of Califor-nia X  X  OPAC, MELVYL, decreased by about 0.0062% per day over the data collection period. Larson sug-gested that the major problem that contributed to the decline was due to users X  difficulties in formulating subject queries using the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).

Table 1 also shows that there were more queries on author and title as compared to the subject field. This is interesting because author or title search is more specific and requires a user to know exact author information or the exact first few words of a title before a search can be successfully executed. The finding suggests that certain groups of users knew exactly what they were looking out for and this, to a certain extent, is consistent with Lombardo and Condic X  X  (2000) work which found that most OPAC users could identify whether they required an author or title search, but could not determine when to use subject search. 4.3. Query length
Table 2 (columns (a) X (c)) shows the query lengths (number of terms), their frequencies and percentages in relation to the total number of queries in the transaction logs. The most common length was two terms (34.1%), followed by a single term (23.6%) and three terms (17.3%). Thus, queries comprising not more than three terms constituted approximately 75.0% of all submitted queries. Put differently, only 25.0% of all queries employed more than three terms. Interestingly, 35 queries were submitted without any terms and that became the minimum query length. At the other extreme, the maximum query length was 46.

A further analysis of query lengths was conducted by using the median query length as a cut-off point. Most of the long queries that exceeded the median (queries with greater than or equal to 23 terms) were found to be keyword searches with diverse topics ranging from art, business to science. Two examples are highlighted in
Table 3 . These queries share a common characteristic in that they have a very narrow focus and provide a large amount of context.

Although long queries were discovered in the NTU OPAC transaction logs, the average query length was found to be only 2.86 terms, with a standard deviation of 2.102. This value is consistent with the short queries found in other OPAC and Web IR systems, and suggest that query lengths have not changed throughout an extended period of time. For instance, Wallace (1993) found that 75.0% of the searches in the University of
Colorado OPAC had two or fewer terms. An analysis of the Alta Vista search engine query logs revealed an with the investigations conducted on digital libraries ( Jones et al., 2000; Mahoui &amp; Cunningham, 2001 ). 4.4. Boolean operators used
Table 4 (columns (a) X (c)) shows limited use of Boolean operators by NTU OPAC users in which only 11.8% of all queries involved the use Boolean operators. Of these, about 10.4% contained only one type of
Boolean operator such as  X  X  X ND X  X ,  X  X  X R X  X  or  X  X  X OT X  X . This is consistent with Matthews (1997) who found that the Boolean feature was infrequently utilized despite the fact that the majority of OPAC systems support Boolean searching. Excite users were also found to hardly ever use Boolean operators in their queries ( Spink, Wolfram, Jansen, &amp; Saracevic, 2001 ).

In the NTU OPAC, approximately 88.2% of queries were submitted without the use of Boolean operators (see Table 4 ). This is despite the fact that a tip on the OPAC query page (see Fig. 1 ) indicated that the use of operators and qualifiers was permitted. However, this brief tip did not provide any usage examples and so may have been ignored by users who either did not understand the meaning of the tip, or who would rather issue simple keyword-only queries similar to Web-based searches. This observation is similar to Yuan (1997) , who found out that most OPAC users tended to learn only enough to do simple searches. Furthermore, most users did not understand how to use Boolean operators in OPAC systems properly ( Hildreth, 1997 ).

In the NTU OPAC, Boolean operators were specified by the operators  X  X  X ND X  X ,  X  X  X R X  X , and  X  X  X OT X  X  as part of a keyword search. This approach of making Boolean operators optional appears to be consistent with research showing that OPAC users were generally not in favor of using Boolean operators ( Dinet, Favart, &amp;
Passerault, 2004 ). Nevertheless when Boolean operators were used in the NTU OPAC, the  X  X  X ND X  X  operator was the most popular and it accounted for approximately 10.3% of all queries. The high frequency of the  X  X  X ND X  X  operator suggests that a majority of users who used Boolean operators started the search with a narrowing strategy in mind, consistent with the work of Ke et al. (2002) . The high degree of precision could have possibly been the reason why NTU OPAC users explored more searches using the  X  X  X ND X  X  operator.
The  X  X  X R X  X  operator on the other hand, is useful when users are unfamiliar with which terms to employ in a search. However, only a very small percentage (less than 0.1%) used it. Like the prior study on Excite users ( Spink et al., 2001 ), only a minuscule percentage of users used the  X  X  X OT X  X  operator (0.01% of all queries).

Boolean operators can also be combined within a single query but our results show that only 1.38% of all queries were submitted as such (see Table 4 ). A few combinations of Boolean operators are possible: OR, NOT.
 AND, OR.
 AND, NOT.
 AND, NOT, OR.

Among these, the  X  X  X ND X  X  and  X  X  X R X  X  pair was the most frequently used (about 1.37% of all queries). For-mulating useful Boolean queries is indeed an art ( Salton, 1988 ). A large retrieval set may overwhelm users when queries are broadly formulated by the  X  X  X R X  X  operator while queries with the  X  X  X ND X  X  operator may gen-erate too few results. Hence, the combination of  X  X  X ND X  X  and  X  X  X R X  X  operators could balance the number of search results, which perhaps explains why these two operators were the most frequently combined. There was a low percentage of queries using the full combination of  X  X  X OT X  X ,  X  X  X R X  X  and  X  X  X ND X  X  operators (0.0039%) as well as the  X  X  X OT X  X  and  X  X  X ND X  X  pair (0.0028%). Only two queries (0.0003%) were found using the combina-tion of  X  X  X OT X  X  and  X  X  X R X  X  operators. These findings suggest that NTU OPAC users seldom negate their query statements. 4.5. Failure analysis
In the following, we discuss several aspects of search failure in the NTU OPAC. We adopt a practical def-
Jones et al., 2000 ). 4.5.1. Search options
A total of 317,840 queries returned zero hits and this figure accounted for 49.5% of the total number of queries submitted to the NTU OPAC (see Table 1 columns (d) and (e)). This indicates that users have an almost equal chance of submitting a query that returns no hits (a search failure) or one that returns at least one record. On closer examination, the table also indicates that most title searches were successful in that a larger proportion generated non-zero hits.

Table 1 shows that the results returned for author searches were rather balanced for both zero (4.1%) and non-zero hits (4.0%). Among keyword searches, the most popular search option, 34.2% of all queries returned zero hits while 34.7% were non-zero hits. The worst performer was subject search in which users experienced high failure rates (4.5% zero hits versus 1.9% non-zero hits). One possible reason for this high failure rate might be because users were unaware that the NTU OPAC could only retrieve records that started with the search terms. Thus, subject searches were comparatively more difficult because the query must not only start with the correct terms but also conform to LCSH. The lack of knowledge of LCSH on the part of users could possibly account for this high failure rate. Drabenstott and Weller (1996) highlighted that despite a de-cade of online catalog research, development and deployment, many of the same problems that the earliest online catalog searchers encountered continued to be experienced by today X  X  users, particularly in the area of subject access. This is consistent with a study on MELVYL that showed that 44% of searches produced no hits with one-third of the subject queries failing to produce retrievals ( Lynch, 1988 ). 4.5.2. Typographical errors
Typographical errors can be divided into four main categories, namely, substitutions, omissions, insertions and transpositions ( Brown, 1988; Hirst &amp; Budanitsky, 2003 ). Such errors can be major causes for unsuccessful searches because accurate spelling is typically required ( Borgman, Hirsh, Walter, &amp; Gallagher, 1995 ). An investigation was performed on a random sample of 1000 queries with zero hits returned. These queries were examined manually to identify patterns behind typographical errors. Next, erroneous terms were grouped into the four error categories.

Of the 1000 queries, a very small number of only 24 were identified with typographical errors. Table 5 pro-vides some examples of such errors. Of the 24, most of the typographical errors were due to omissions. For instance, the term  X  X  X nviromental X  X  was entered without the letter  X  X  X  X  X  that occurs between the letter  X  X  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  X  X . Substitutions were encountered as frequently as omissions. For example, the term  X  X  X undamentals X  X  was submitted as  X  X  X indamentals X  X  instead. Here, the placement of letters on the keyboard is the likely cause, for example, the position of the letter  X  X  X  X  X  is next to  X  X  X  X  X . In addition, there were terms found with letters in the wrong order (transpositional errors). For example, the word  X  X  X eisngs X  X  was found instead of the correct term  X  X  X esigns X  X . There were however few cases of errors due to additional characters (insertions). 4.5.3. Query length
The number of search terms used in a query can affect the returned results. Table 2 (columns (d) and (e)) shows that there were more results with non-zero hits when query lengths were one or two. The percentage of successful queries with one search term was double that of failed queries (15.9% versus 7.7% respectively). For queries with two terms, the success rate was 19.7% against a 14.4% failure rate. In general, when query length increases, there is a higher probability that users would encounter unsuccessful searches. One of the possible explanations might be that the underlying retrieval logic of the NTU OPAC required users to enter search terms in the order in which they appeared in the library X  X  bibliographic records. Given a longer query length, the probability of matching the query string against these records would be lowered. This finding is presented in Fig. 2 which shows that as query length increases, the ratio of non-zero hit results to zero-hit results decreases. For query lengths greater than 25, there were only zero-hit results. Further support was found via a correlational analysis on query length against ratio (query length of zero was not considered). Here, a negative correlation was obtained [ r = 0.67, p &lt; 0.001]. Taken together, our findings suggest that shorter query lengths decrease the likelihood of search failure. 4.5.4. Boolean operators Table 4 (columns (d) and (e)) shows the number of Boolean queries returning non-zero and zero hits. Here, Boolean queries refer to those with single or combined Boolean operators. In total, there were 42,961 zero-hit
Boolean queries and 32,517 non-zero hit queries. This outcome was relatively worse than the results obtained queries contained errors leading to search failure. In contrast, more than half of the Boolean queries in the NTU OPAC transaction logs were failed searches.

Our results show that the failure rate of queries with the  X  X  X ND X  X  operator (6.0%) was higher than those of successful searches (4.3%). Although users could obtain higher precision by using the  X  X  X ND X  X  operator, they also ran into the risk of not obtaining any results when one or more of the terms were incorrectly used. Put differently, while the introduction of an  X  X  X ND X  X  clause could potentially reduce the number of records retrieved from the OPAC, it could also return zero hits in the worst case. This, to certain extent, provides a reason why queries with the  X  X  X ND X  X  operator had higher search failure rates. In contrast,  X  X  X R X  X  Boolean queries returned a higher proportion of non-zero hits relative to those with zero hits. Here, the use of  X  X  X R X  X  Boolean operator increased the search scope which in turn reduced the likelihood of obtaining zero hits.
Whether these results satisfied users X  information needs is however, not considered in this work. Queries using the  X  X  X OT X  X  operator showed an almost equal likelihood of zero or non-zero hit results.

The proportion of queries with combined Boolean operators returning zero hits and non-zero hits varied depending on the types of operators used. Table 4 shows that Boolean queries with the combination of  X  X  X ND X  X  and  X  X  X R X  X  operators had a tendency to produce fewer zero hits while those using  X  X  X ND X  X  and  X  X  X OT X  X  produced an opposite result. The failure rates could be explained by the nature of the operators used.
For example, the  X  X  X OT X  X  operator is used to exclude a term from the search, which has a narrowing effect on search scope. Hence, when  X  X  X OT X  X  is added to the  X  X  X ND X  X  operator, the search criteria becomes increasingly tightened. Of the 18 queries that used  X  X  X ND X  X  and  X  X  X OT X  X , 11 returned zero hits while the other seven returned non-zero hits. On other hand, the presence of an  X  X  X R X  X  operator in a query with an  X  X  X ND X  X  operator has the effect of widening the search scope, leading to more non-zero hits being obtained. 5. Discussion and conclusion
The ultimate goal of an IR system is to assist users in fulfilling their information needs. Analyzing an IR system X  X  transaction logs to uncover search and failure patterns can therefore yield ways to further improve the system. Such improvements not apply to the system being analyzed but may lead to enhancements in the design of other systems as well. However, it is also important to overcome the present limitations for future work. 5.1. Recommendations
Our results show that simple searches with short query lengths and low usage of Boolean operators com-prised the majority of NTU OPAC queries. The findings are consistent with results from prior work such as
Mahoui and Cunningham (2001) and Jansen et al. (2000) . Our failure analyses show that on average, users had an almost equal chance of submitting a query that returned no results and one that returned at least one record. This is surprising given that with the popularity of search engines, one would assume that users would have become more proficient in searching. In sum, our results suggest that that search patterns have not changed very much across the years and across geographical boundaries despite many years of experience in the use, research and development of information retrieval systems.

With the results obtained in our work, we propose some recommendations for enhancing the NTU OPAC, all of which are applicable to other systems as well: 1. Interactive query reformulation . This refers to a family of techniques that assist users in query formulation by recommending alternative query terms ( Belkin et al., 2001; Efthimiadis, 1996 ). A technique that we are currently exploring is to employ querying recommending techniques in the NTU OPAC ( Fu, Goh, &amp; Foo, 2005 ). Here, submitted queries stored in transaction logs and mined, and related ones are recommended to users during query formulation. Users also have the opportunity to explore relationships between queries using a graph-based visualization interface. Our approach thus allows users to peruse queries directly related to a submitted query, as well as those that are indirectly related. 2. Browsing . Given the poor performance of subject searches, the ability to browse subject indexes would be helpful. Browsing would also be a helpful complement for author searches since different name variants for the same person makes it harder for the users to retrieve all records by the same individual at once ( Fei-telson, 2004; Smith, 2000 ). In addition, browsing is useful when information needs are vague, such as when a user is a novice in the domain ( Hildreth, 1995a ). Through browsing, users can identify documents of inter-est and from these, ideas for formulating/reformulating a query can then be established. Several techniques are available. One approach would be to include browsing options for authors, titles and subjects within the
OPAC query page. A potential problem is that the list of entries could be large especially for LCSH subject headings. Hence a second browse-search approach could allow users to browse portions of various indexes that match specified search terms. A final technique involves hyperlinking selected terms (e.g. author names, keywords) in the bibliographic records or search results listings for browsing. This feature is similar to databases such as Web of Science and the ACM Digital Library. 3. Context-sensitive assistance . Borgman (1996) argued that searchers require varying levels of help in con-structing queries. Further, differences between expert and novice users in articulating their information needs and the search strategies they adopt suggest that such assistance has to be tailored according to indi-viduals ( Sutcliffe, Ennis, &amp; Watkinson, 2000 ). An approach that we are investigating uses concepts in sub-jective relevance to develop user-centered IR systems ( Lee, Theng, Goh, &amp; Foo, 2005 ). In our work, desirable features of IR systems are elicited from novice and expert searchers, and these are mapped to dif-ferent subject relevance types ( Saracevic, 1996 ) and stages in an adopted online information seeking model ( Marchionini, 1995 ). This mapping is then used to implement a prototype IR system that supports various subject relevance types in each stage of the information seeking process. Examples of features include term and document recommendations, customized help and links to experts and users with similar interests.
However, for such user-centered services to be provided in the NTU OPAC, user profiles may have to be created and therefore users would have to authenticate themselves before using the system. 5.2. Conclusion
The findings of the present work have played a useful role in informing our ongoing research in the design and implementation of user-centered IR systems, including interactive query formulation using query recommend-ing and the support for subjective relevance in information seeking. There are however limitations to transaction ries being equated with search failure may not always hold, as a non zero-hit result does not necessarily indicate that a user X  X  information need is met. Thus, one area of work that could be explored is to supplement the present analysis with other techniques including questionnaire surveys and interviews. For example, data obtained from tion, research in user-centered design suggests that it is essential to evaluate the NTU OPAC interface and deter-mine the extent it has helped users in translating their information needs into explicit query terms. Evaluation could be focused on aspects such as user satisfaction, ease of learning, ease of use and error prevention. Acknowledgements
