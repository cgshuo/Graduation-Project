 [5], etc. However, most of them can deal with data only having numerical attributes, [10], and harvested some fruits. This paper presents a rough set-based fuzzy clustering algorithm (RSFCL). In relations are equal. We also prove correctness of the theorem using rough set theory. equivalence classes as [7] [11]. We adopt two different dissimilarity measures for two types of data: the Euclidean distance for numerical data and the matching measure for establishing fuzzy similar matrix so that fuzzy equivalence relations represents more simple knowledge that generates adequate number of categories. But our approach is results showed that the algorithm had good performance for both numerical attributes and symbolic attributes. RSFCL algorithm. Section 3 presents our experimental results, and finally, in section 4, we present our conclusions. fuzzy clustering. Detailed steps are given as follows. 2.1 Initial Clustering Definition 1. Equivalence Relation 
Equivalence relation of one object i x is defined: }} ] [ { }, ] {{[ between two objects x i and x j , and  X   X  =  X  } ] [ { } ] {[
The attributes of different datasets can be not identical. Hence computing methods attributes. relations. Suppose we obtain a dissimilarity matrix If  X  is set to 0.25 then we obtain R R x
The initial partition of the dataset can be obtained by computing the intersection of directly and simply. The detailed discuss is given as follow. Theorem 1. Let R is a group of equivalence relations defined by Definition 1, and let R cluster. 
Let U is be the entire set of objects, for U x k  X   X  , and then (i) For U x k  X   X  , for all ) 1 ( n k k  X   X  , suppose equivalence class partitioned into the same cluster. and } ] [ { into the same cluster. same cluster if j i R R = . clusters. and and Hence obtained directly and simply by judging whether two equivalence relations are equal, and almost have no use for any additional calculation. 2.2 Secondary Clustering regarded as a new big granule, such that fuzzy clustering is applied in a big granular world. Definition 2. Fuzzy Similarity Between Two Initial Clusters then the fuzzy similarity between the two initial clusters is defined by Where `similar matrix corresponding with R U / , and the matrix can be transformed into an m-order fuzzy equivalence matrix Proof: I. For obtain
II. For i k C x  X   X  and j l C x  X   X  , if we can educe that
Therefore the matrix of fuzzy set [13], we can educe that exists certainly an m -order fuzzy similar matrix an m -order fuzzy equivalence matrix 
For above example, the fuzzy similarity matrix Since 2.3 Evaluation of Validity modification of initial clusters based on equivalence relations. Definition 3 . Integrated Approximate Precision relations, and  X  , where approximations of C k given below. approximate precision H ( C ) is defined by various values of the threshold 2  X  . considered for the purpose of conducting the experiments. These data sets come from Iris, thyroid-disease and glass. Table 1 shows brief introduction of seven datasets. Shoji Hirano [7] presented a clustering method based on rough sets (Marked of small categories was suppressed by modifying similar equivalence relations into the rough set (Marked Algorithm B) in which the objects of fuzzy clustering were original clustering algorithms were compared in terms of clustering average accuracy obtained for 50 different run times. RSFCL algorithm and Algorithm A were also compared in terms of response time with different datasets for 50 different run times. 3.1 Clustering Validity accuracy obtained by the three clustering algorithms. 
As seen from Table 2, the performances of Algorithm A and RSFCL algorithm are inferior to that of Algorithm A. 3.2 Run Efficiency Since Algorithm A and RSFCL algorithm both have favorable clustering validity, run Note that response time of RSFCL algorithm is shorter than that of Algorithm A for testing datasets, especially when the number of data objects is high in datasets. 
The computations of the dissimilarity between two objects and initial equivalence RSFCL algorithm, the secondary clustering requires computing square of fuzzy The experimental results were consistent with above analysis. handling the clustering problems of both numerical data and nominal data. extent. One should stress, however, that the thresholds could influence the clustering result.
