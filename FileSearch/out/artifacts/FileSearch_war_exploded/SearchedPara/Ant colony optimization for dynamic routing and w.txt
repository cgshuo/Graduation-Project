 1. Introduction
Optical networks are a type of high-capacity telecommunica-tion networks that can provide routing, grooming, and restoration at wavelength level ( Green, 1992 ). The technology of Wavelength
Division Multiplexing ( WDM ) networks is mainly based on optical wavelength-division multiplexing on optical fibers for forming a number of multi-communication channels at different wavelengths with an electronic processing speed ( Lowe, 1998 ).
WDM networks provide connectivity among optical components to let optical communication meet the increasing demands for high channel bandwidths and low communication delays. The utilization of wavelengths to route data is referred as wavelength routing, and an optical switch employing the technique is referred as a wavelength-routing switch. Therefore, in a wavelength-routing WDM network that is constructed using optical fiber links to connect input ports and output ports in wavelength-routing switches, data can be routed to other optical switches based on wavelengths of optical fibers. If the transmission between input port and output port involves two different wavelengths, the switch should have the capacity of wavelength conversion ( Ramamurthy and Mukherjee, 1998 ) and gives rise to transmis-sion delay and deployment cost. Deploying a part of switches with wavelength conversion in networks can be a viable alternative to balance the cost of constructing networks and network efficiency.
Networks of this type are referred as WDM networks with sparse wavelength conversion.
 ( Chlamtac et al., 1992 ) can be set up in a similar way as a circuit-switched network to carry data among switches at wavelength level without optical-to-electrical and electrical-to-optical conversions, and then the data can be transmitted according to the trail of the light-path. Since different set-up light-paths will occupy different resources (e.g., switches, wave-lengths) and end-to-end transmission time in network commu-nication, the communication cost and the transmission delay of a light-path are usually used as the criterion for evaluating the efficiency of a light-path. The communication cost may be the numbers or the costs of utilized fibers and switches included in a light-path. The transmission delay is the sum of transmission delays of all switches and links in the light-path. The routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem known to be NP-hard ( Karasan and Ayanoglu, 1998 ) is defined as follows: Given a set of connection requests, each of which is specified to transmit data from a source to a destination, the problem is to find a light-path from the source to the destination for each request and to assign a wavelength to each link included in the light-path.
 The RWA problem can be categorized into two types, static
RWA (SRWA) and dynamic RWA (DRWA). The SRWA problem is to determine the logical topology which can be used to configure all switches according to the found light-paths and assigned wavelengths in the given network. The objective is usually to maximize the routing throughput ( Krishnaswamy and Sivarajan, 2001 ) or to minimize the number of required wavelengths. The
DRWA counterpart is an on-line version in which connection requests arrive one at a time, and the requests must be routed in real time under the current environment of the network. For minimizing blocking probability ( Shen et al., 2001; Qin et al., 2003; Ngo et al., 2006 ) and wavelengths, the objective is to find a survival light-path when some links fail, and to maximize the carried traffic ( Kavian et al., 2007 ). For setting up and tearing down light-paths to minimize the number of blocked connections, a distributed control scheme for establishing reliability-con-strained least-cost light-paths and four heuristics were proposed in Saradhi et al. (2007) .

Many new network applications, such as videoconferencing, video on demand system, on-line gaming, etc., have inspired the demands for new communication models. Moreover, to guarantee that video and audio signals can be efficiently transmitted in interactive multimedia applications, transmission delays from a source to a destination will be limited under a given delay bound, where the delay bound may be decided according to the degree of emergence, data priority, or application type of data. Therefore, the demand about data transmission in the future. A request with delay bound dictates that it needs to be successfully transmitted before its given delay constraint is violated. The issue of routing this type of requests is referred as the RWA with delay constraints problem (RWA-DC) in WDM networks.

In most cases, switches with wavelength conversion are reserved to provide the imperative of converting wavelength in the light-path such that the data can be successfully transmitted.
In order to avoid using this type of switches in the light-path not requiring wavelength conversion, it is necessary to incur extra costs for using this type of switches. Although most of previous research neglected the communication cost of wavelength conversion in switches so as to simplify the problem and thus reduce the complexity, the communication cost of wavelength conversion is taken into consideration in this paper to ensure that the light-path can make better use of the switches without conversion capability. Besides, because transmission delay occurs in the case that wavelength is converted in a switch with wavelength conversion, it is therefore crucial to take transmission delay into account. In this paper, we assume communication cost and transmission delay in switches are incurred when the wavelength is converted between the input and output ports. In summary, the dynamic RWA-DC (DRWA-DC) problem involves the following three features: (1) some of the switches can provide wavelength conversion, (2) data transmission through switches using different wavelengths at input and output ports incurs communication cost and transmission delay, and (3) requests are associated with delay bounds. The goal is to minimize the total communication cost.

For the RWA problem, Karasan and Ayanoglu (1998) proved the NP-hardness. Integer linear programming (ILP) models ( Krishnaswamy and Sivarajan, 2001 ), statistics ( Ngo et al., 2006 ), and meta-heuristics including heuristics ( Shen et al., 2001; Qin et al., 2003 ) and genetic algorithm (GA) ( Kavian et al., 2007 ) were proposed to cope with different problem settings. Although the ILP model can be deployed to find optimal solutions, the execution time is not affordable for large-scale networks. Moreover, the DRWA-DC problem exhibits much more complicated structures; it is unlikely to follow the ILP approach to produce optimal solutions in an acceptable time.

In this paper, we address a design of ant colony optimization (ACO), which is a meta-heuristic developed in the early 1990s ( Dorigo et al., 1991 ). The ACO uses natural metaphor inspired by the behavior of ant colonies to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems for finding near-optimal solutions. It has demonstrated significant strengths in many application areas, such as the traveling salesman problem ( Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997 ), generalized minimum spanning tree problem ( Shyu et al., 2003 ), scheduling problems ( Shyu et al., 2004a; Lin et al., 2008; Udomsakdigool and Kachitvichyanukul, 2008; Sabuncuoglu et al., 2009 ), optimization of chaotic systems ( Wang and Ip, 2005 ), minimum weight vertex cover problem ( Shyu et al., 2004b ), layout design of satellite modules ( Sun and Teng, 2003 ), assembly line balancing ( McMullen and Tarasewich, 2006 ), and distributed few. The details of the ACO design for solving the RWA problem will be described later.
 In Varela and Sinclair (1999) , Garlick and Barr (2002) , and Kwang and Weng (2003) , the ACO has been used to solve the RWA problem, but communication cost, wavelength conversion cost and delay bound were not incorporated in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, Varela and Sinclair (1999) is the first paper applying the ACO to cope with the SRWA problem. In their design, each ant keeps a tabu list of previously visited nodes to avoid dead-ends and cycles and to allow backtracking, where back-tracking means that an ant will reversely pop out its previous location to alter the visited nodes when the already found partial tour is blocked. Garlick and Barr (2002) extended the ACO application to the DRWA problem by using length and congestion information in making routing decisions to reduce the possibility of network blocking in the tour-constructing phase. In Kwang and Weng (2003) , a survey and comparison on ACO applications to routing and load-balancing issues were presented. Varela and Sinclair (1999) and Garlick and Barr (2002) both used the shortest path algorithm and the minimum number of edges of paths to find a light-path as the heuristic ingredient of the ACO. However, delay bounds make these heuristics inappropriate for solving the DRWA-DC problem. Moreover, the realistic concerns about wavelength conversion in switches give rise to a more compli-cated problem. According to the three characteristics: delay bound, wavelength conversion, and objective function, Table 1 shows the comparisons of previous research papers: Krishnaswamy and et al. (2003) , Ngo et al. (2006) ,and Kavian et al. (2007) .
The DRWA-DC problem is relatively difficult because many issues need to be simultaneously taken into account: the request is associated with a delay bound, the parts of switches have a wavelength conversion capability, and a light-path is evaluated by communication cost and wavelength conversion cost. Since the DRWA-DC problem is computationally challenging, it is very unlikely to optimally solve it in polynomial time. While the ACO has been applied to solve some specific RWA, no results have been reported to the complex, but realistic, problem involving delay bound and wavelength conversion simultaneously. In this paper, we shall design new ACO features to produce solutions to the studied problem.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is dedicated to a formal formulation of the DRWA-DC problem. In Section 3, we shall introduce the basic structure of the ACO and then present several features that can nicely shape the DRWA-DC problem into a graph-based framework that is suitable for the development and application of ACO algorithms. Section 4 is dedicated to the computational experiments designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed ACO algorithm. Numerical results and analysis are also included. Section 5 summarizes the results and gives some concluding remarks. 2. Problem formulation
Before proceeding to the problem statements and formulation, we introduce the notation that will be used throughout this paper. Notation

A network is represented by a weighted graph G ( V , E ), where V is the set of switches and set E contains directed edges corresponding to the directed optical links among the switches. 9
V 9  X  n denotes the number of nodes in the network. Binary variable w i indicates whether the node i A V is associated with wavelength conversion, annotated by w i  X  1 or 0. The directed edge from node i to node j is denoted by e ij . c ( e ij ) and d ( e ) represent the communication cost and the transmission delay of edge e ij , respectively. At node i , wavelength communication cost and wavelength transmission delay are denoted by ^ c  X  i  X  and respectively. The set of wavelengths available on the optical links is denoted by W with cardinality 9 W 9  X  m as the number of different wavelengths. The m wavelengths on each e ij can be viewed as m wavelength links e ijl ,1 r l r m , to represent the wavelength-based connections, where c ( e ijl )  X  c ( e wavelength conversion capacity such that the signal passing from e ij to enter the input port of j using wavelength l can be transmitted to switch k from the output port of j using wavelength l 0 .
 indicating that there is data originating from source s to be routed to destination d and the transmission delay of the complete routing session from s to d must be smaller than or equal to the delay bound D . Each request may be different from any of the others in respects of different sources, different destinations, and different delay bounds, which usually are determined by its priority, degree of emergence or other criteria.
 that consists of a sequence of connected wavelength links. Let variables I i and O i represent the used wavelength labels at the input and output ports passing through switch i , respectively. The transmission delay passing through switch i is I i O i jj lm transmission delay ( ^ d  X  i  X  ) exists only in the case that the wavelengths are different between input and output ports ( I i a O i ). Considering wavelength conversion in general, the communication cost T c ( e ijl ) and the transmission delay T to reduce the complexity. Therefore, the overall communication cost and the transmission delay incurred in the assigned light-path P are c  X  P  X  X  P e tively. The assigned light-path P will be a feasible solution for are all satisfied: (1) the origin of P is s ; (2) the destination node of P is d ; and (3) the transmission delay of P is no greater than the delay bound
In the rest of paper, for notational convenience, assigned light-path and feasible solution will be replaced with light-path and solution if no confusion would arise. 3. ACO design for DRWA-DC
In this section, we develop several features for the deployment of the ACO. The notation used in our ACO design is given in the following: b number of ants x percentage of the b ants to distribute at s and d
A k set of nodes accessible to ant k ijl initial pheromone on wavelength link e ijl ijl dynamic desirability measure (pheromone intensity) on

P k light-path traversed by ant k c ( P ) communication cost of P k , c  X  P k  X  X  P e d ( P ) transmission delay of P k , d  X  P k  X  X  P e
The ACO is a family of meta-heuristics that are inspired by the natural optimization mechanism conducted by real ants. The general framework of the ACO algorithm is shown in Fig. 1 .In the ACO framework, the underlying environment for the ant colony to explore through is a directed graph, possibly with weights assigned to the edges. Therefore, a studied problem is usually represented by a weighted graph. The ACO system starts by distributing a set of artificial ants onto the graph. Each ant will construct a tour that corresponds to a solution to the original problem. When all ants attain solutions, they share their information via pheromone and then next iteration commences.
The process is repeated until some pre-specified criterion is satisfied. The optimization mechanism of the above-mentioned process is carried out by two important features: state transition rules and pheromone updating rules. A state transition rule is used for an ant to determine which node it will visit next (Step 2.2.1). The pheromone updating rules dynamically updates the pheromone intensities (or, in simple words, the degree of preference) on the edges (Steps 2.2.2 and 2.3). For general discussion on the philosophy and design detail, the reader is referred to Dorigo et al. (1991) .

Although the ACO has been applied to deal with SWRA ( Varela and Sinclair, 1999 ) and DRWA ( Garlick and Barr, 2002 ), these proposed approaches do not work for the DRWA-DC problem. For example, the backtracking method for avoiding dead-ants in
Varela and Sinclair (1999) and Garlick and Barr (2002) cannot be used in DRWA-DC because transmission delays need to be taken into account. The existence of delay bounds of requests stipulates the global pheromone updating rule to test whether some ants arrive at the destinations successfully qualifying by the delay bound. In this section, we propose and design an ACO algorithm that can produce approximate solutions with all the addressed realistic constraints incorporated. 3.1. Initialization of ACO
In our ACO design for the DRWA-DC problem, the initialization phase includes two parts, dispatching ants to nodes and initializing pheromone on edges. For the first part, the trail of an ant can be viewed as a light-path. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that an ant will start from the source and stop at the destination of the request. The optimal trail with the minimum communication cost indicates that it is an optimal routing light-path for the request. The strategy that finds trails from source towards destination is called forward searching. On the other hand, backward searching refers to the strategy starting from the destination. Combining both strategies, we can let the ants begin their searching sessions randomly at either the source s or the destination d . In this paper, parameter x is given to adjust the percentage of b ants to be initially dispatched to s ; that is, the numbers of ants initially positioned at the source and the destination are x b and (1 x ) b , respectively.

For the second initialization task, applying some heuristics will provide informative guidance to determine the initial pheromone, and possibly short enthetimerequiredbyfinding a near optimal or even optimal solution. Considering the objective of minimizing the total communication cost of routing a given request, the i nitial pheromone t ijl on each wavelength link e ijl is defined as  X 
Recall the definition of l ijl  X  0, which indicates that wavelength infeasible wavelength link, the initial pheromone of that wave-initial pheromone will be set as in Eq. (3) to let a wavelength link with less communication cost have a higher intensity of initial pheromone than the others. 3.2. State transition rule
The state transition rule presented in this paper features the following two aspects. First, unlike the ACO research ( Shyu et al., 2004b ) proposed solutions through the exploration of the power wavelength links from the source to the destination. Depending on whether the switches provide wavelength conversion or not, each ant can choose wavelength links using the same or different wavelengths to route data to the next switch. That is, the solution to DRWA-DC can be viewed as a sequence of wavelength links, and the preference information (including pheromone intensity and local heuristic value) is deposited on the wavelength links.
Secondly, the local heuristic used in most of previous research is static (that is, the value will not change during the optimization process). Shyu et al. (2004b) deployed a dynamic heuristic to reflect the situation that the access preference for a wavelength link changes over time depending on which wavelength links have been already selected. Due to the above concerns, we modify i uses wavelength link e ijl to route data to node j as follows: that no node can be traversed for more than once, t ijl is the dynamic desirability measure about the access to the wavelength wavelength link based on a problem-specific local heuristic, and b is the parameter controlling the relative significance between the two measures. Following the same line of reasoning in Eq. (3), l is added to each equation to guarantee that any infeasible wavelength link, i.e., l ijl  X  0, cannot be chosen.

The value of p k ijl can be decided according to a random number q drawn from the open interval (0, 1). If q is less than a specified threshold q 0 , the wavelength link e ijl with the maximal product l t irt  X  Z k irt  X  b is always selected (see Eq. (4)); otherwise, the wavelength link is selected according to the probability given in scheme between the exploitation search and the exploration search of the problem space. Note that the probability value p k depends on which wavelength link the ant uses to construct the light-path (trail) and that the transmission delay of the light-path is constrained by the delay bound. When the trail exceeds the will be defined in the next paragraph. Therefore, such a wavelength link will not be selected in Eq. (4). It thus highly suggests that the quality and feasibility of a solution depend on the wavelength links selected; that is, the communication cost and the transmission delay of light-path reflect the quality of the solution found by some ant and whether the solution is feasible or not, respectively. The value of variable t ijl , which gradually the quality of the final solution constructed at the end of each cycle and will be described in the next subsection. Local preference is incorporated to reflect the objective of communica-tion cost minimization subject to transmission delay bounds.
When there is no feasible solution found by the ant colony, determining a feasible solution, if exists, becomes more crucial.
Therefore, the local preference needs to reflect the status of whether a feasible solution has been found thus far. During the solution-seeking session, if no feasible solution has been encoun-tered, the local preference will center on how to find a feasible solution according to the transmission delays of links; otherwise, the aspect of communication cost is considered. Therefore, the for wavelength link e ijl , changes dynamically and is given by where Z k ijl can be seen as the inverse value of transmission delay (Eq. (5)) or the inverse value of communication cost (Eq. (5)), depending on whether the ACO system has explored some feasible solution or not. In the sequel, the proposed dynamic local heuristic favors the feasible wavelength link that has either minimum transmission delays or minimum communica-tion costs. 3.3. Pheromone updating rule updating rules as follows. First, at the end of each cycle we keep track of the best feasible solution P best and the worst infeasible solution P worst encountered by the colony. Our idea is to encourage the ants to follow links in P best and avoid links in P in the following cycles. This idea is realized by reinforcing (respectively, lessening) the intensities of the pheromone cur-rently left on the wavelength links in P best (respectively, P
The pheromone t ijl on wavelength link e ijl is updated according to the following global updating rule: where and pheromone intensity and enables the algorithm to reduce the made.
 shuffle the solutions and prevent early convergence, i.e., all the ants make the same decisions. The local updating rule is performed at the end of each step when each ant selects a new wavelength link e ijl . The pheromone intensity on link e updated by where j A (0, 1) is a parameter adjusting the current pheromone on e ijl . Note that the local updating rule decreases the pheromone intensity on the link just visited by an ant and makes the selected links less attractive to other ants. The effect of the process will direct the exploration session of an ant toward the links that have not yet been visited by other ants.
 3.4. Stopping criterion
Like other meta-heuristics, different types of stopping criteria can be used for the ACO. We cite the following four for the reader X  X  interest:
C 1: The number of iterations is greater than a specified iteration limit.

C 2: The execution time is longer than a specified CPU time limit.

C 3: The averages of communication costs of ants in some consecutive iterations remain unchanged.

C 4: The number of consecutive iterations in which no improvement attained on the incumbent solution is greater than a specified limit.

In this paper, we use the last one ( C 4) as the stopping criteria of our ACO design. 4. Computational experiments
This paper focuses on determining an assigned light-path of low communication cost such that switches in the network can be set up to route a request. To study the performance of the proposed approach, we designed and conducted a series of computational simulations. The scheme used in our simulation can be referred to Waxman (1988) . In the scheme, there are n nodes randomly distributed over a rectangular grid with integer coordinates. In a network topology generated for experiments, each directed link from node u to node v is associated with the coordinate distance between u and v , d is the maximum distance between each two nodes, and l and g are control variables selected from interval (0, 1].

The communication cost from node u to node v is defined by taking the integer value of the distance between them on the grid.
The transmission delay is an integer randomly generated from random manner. The delay bound D must be reasonable, for otherwise it is unlikely for a feasible light-path to be found. To generate a request with a reasonable delay bound, we use the value according to the minimum transmission delay between s and d found by applying Dijstra X  X  shortest path algorithm ( Dijstra, 1959 ), and set D to be equal to w times of the derived minimum transmission delay, where w is a control parameter dictating the tightness between delay bound and minimum transmission delay.
In our experiments, we set l  X  0.7, g  X  0.7, and size of rectangular grid  X  100 to simulate the networks with different numbers of nodes. Moreover, 15% of the nodes are equipped with wavelength conversion. As for the parameters of the ACO algorithm, preliminary experiments suggest x  X  0.5, b  X  1, r  X  0.7, j  X  0.9, and q o  X  a  X  0.5.

The experiments consist of three parts: (1) introduction of transmission delays to the ILP formulation ( Chen and Tseng, 2003 ), (2) comparisons between the ACO algorithm and the ILP formulation, and (3) investigation on the number of iterations exerted in the ACO algorithm. The codes were written in C+ +. The platform is a personal computer with an Intel P4 2.4 GMHz CPU and 1 GB RAM. 4.1. Introduction of transmission delays to the ILP formulation
The ILP formulation used in the simulation to solve DRWA-DC is adapted from that proposed in Chen and Tseng (2003) . It was implemented using the linear programming tool ILOG X  X  CPLEX 7.1. Three types of networks were tested: 40 switches ( n  X  40), 50 switches ( n  X  50), and 60 switches ( n  X  60), for each of which 200 different requests were randomly generated. Five wavelengths were provided for the networks. The delay bound was set to be w ( w  X  3.0, 2.0, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1) times of the minimum transmission delay between the source and the destination in each request. For each combination of values of w and network types, the elapsed run times, each of which are averaged over 200 requests, are summarized in Table 2 . The experimental results suggest that the elapsed execution times increase sharply as the number of switches grows or the delay bound becomes tighter (i.e., smaller values of w ). For example, when w  X  1.1, the average execution time is more than 1380 s. Therefore, the ILP formulation cannot solve the DRWA-DC problem well when the number of switches is more 70 or the specified delay bound of a request is close to the minimum transmission delay. 4.2. Comparisons between the ACO and the ILP formulation
In this part, we define the stopping criterion for the ACO algorithm to be that 2000 iterations are reached or the incumbent value is equal to the optimal one. The same experiment settings were also applied to observe the solutions found by the ACO approach. Experimental results are shown in Tables 3 X 5 for the networks with 40, 50, and 60 switches and different w values, respectively. The solutions found by the ILP formulation are used as the baseline for comparisons. In these tables, the first two columns show the value of w and the number of ants. We kept track of the scenarios of the ACO algorithm at iteration 1000 and iteration 2000. Recall that the algorithm will stop before entering later iterations if it encounters an optimal solution. Consider the major column entitled  X  X 1000 Iterations X  X . Four sub-columns summarize the computational statistics at the end of the 1000th iteration: # Fea : number of requests for which feasible solutions are found; # Opt : number of requests that are optimally solved;
Dev : average communication cost deviation of the found solutions from the optimal ones; and ET : average execution time.
 Dev is defined as follows: Dev  X  feasible solution P feas r found at the end of some iteration in the ACO algorithm and the communication cost of the optimal solution P opt r found by the ILP formulation, respectively. The second part reports the results at the end of 2000 iterations. When the ACO algorithm finished processing 200 requests, we also keep track the number of requests that have been optimally solved (column # Opt ). The sub-columns Iter and ET contain the average number of iterations and the average execution time required to produce these optimal solutions. The last major column Non-Opt records information on those test cases for which no optimal solutions were found. Sub-column Iter records the iteration at which the best feasible solution was encountered.

From the numerical results, we have the following observations: (2) When a request with a tight delay bound which is close to the (3) According to the comparisons from Tables 2 to 5 , the (4) Although a larger number of iterations and ants deployed in ACO which may be more reasonable. The comparisons about the number of iterations will be discussed in following section. 4.3. Comparisons of iterations
This part is dedicated to investigating the number of consecutive iterations within which no improvement is attained 1.1) are shown in Figs. 2 X 7 for different numbers of consecutive iterations ( Iter  X  200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000) and different networks ( n  X  40, 50, and 60). According to the experimental results, the type of stopping criterion can provide the performance with less execution time and approximated deviation in average.
The number of consecutive iterations could be determined by the response time and the number of ants. Nevertheless, deviation and execution time seem to be the reasonable factors. From different criteria, we make several observations: (1) From the experimental results in Figs. 2 X 4 , the value of Dev decreases steadily for the increase of the number of ants and the increase of the number of iterations. For example, in Fig. 2 , the average values of Dev are 7.38, 5.14, 4.52, 3.93, and 3.57% (2) According to the experimental results in Fig. 5 , the elapsed (3) For the approximate elapsed execution time, it is more likely (4) Although it is hard to decide the most appropriate ant

In this paper, a meta-heuristic scheme based upon ant colony optimization has been proposed to compose approximate solu-tions to the DRWA-DC problem, which is already known to be computationally intractable. Some heuristics for the SRWA problem and the DRWA problem have been developed in the literature, but few of them have applied the ACO approach or have addressed the issue concerning delay bounds. In this study, we have designed and implemented an ACO approach for solving the DRWA-DC problem. To adjust the ACO approach to meet the specific characteristics of the studied problem, a wavelength-link-based graph is constructed for the ants to traverse on. The effectiveness and robustness of the ACO approach have been examined by extensive experiments. We have also implemented the ILP formulation as a baseline to study the performance of the proposed ACO approach.

The experimental results have clearly evinced that our proposed ACO algorithm can find approximate solutions with average deviations of less than 4% from the optimal ones with an average elapsed execution time only about 0.1% of that required by an ILP formulation. Moreover, the ACO algorithm still works well in solving the DRWA-DC problem for large-scale networks, for which the ILP formulation fails to provide optimal solutions in a reasonable time.
 The purpose of this paper is not to address the superiority the ACO over other meta-heuristic in solving the RWA problem. Our focus is set on addressing the applicability as well as the capability of the ACO algorithm in dealing with the DRWA-DC problem. Our study has not only extended the application areas of the ACO approach but also suggested a new viable method for coping with the complex optimization problems arising from the WDM domain. For further research, it is of potential interest to apply the ACO approach to solve the static RWA-DC problem or the logical network topology design problems. Besides, the multicast routing and wavelength assignment may be another interesting research direction.
