 1. Introduction
Bearing capacity is considered to be one of the significant factors that govern the design of pile foundations. Consequently, many researchers have attempted several procedures to predict pile capacity. However, as the pile X  X oil interaction is ambiguous and not entirely understood, most of the proposed procedures have achieved limited success in terms of providing accurate prediction of pile capacity. This can be attributed to the assumptions and simplifications on which the procedures have based their inter-pretation of pile behavior. In this respect, the methods that do not require prior assumptions such as artificial intelligence techniques may provide better solution. Several researchers (e.g. Chan et al., 1995 ; Teh et al., 1997 ; Abu-Kiefa, 1998 ; Das and Basudhar, 2006 ; Ardalan et al., 2009 ; Shahin, 2010 ) have attempted artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting bearing capacity of pile founda-tions. The modeling advantage of ANNs is the ability to capture the nonlinear and complex relationship between the bearing capacity and the factors affecting it without having to assume a priori formula of what could be this relationship. However, the main shortcoming of ANNs is the large complexities of the network structure, as it represent the knowledge in terms of weight matrices together with biases that are not accessible to the users ( Rezania and Javadi, 2007 ). In this regard, the genetic programming (GP) may represent better alternative. The main advantage of the
GP over the ANNs is the ability to provide the relationship between a set of inputs and the corresponding outputs in a simple mathematical form accessible to the users. Recently, the GP has been found successful in solving several problems in the field of engineering (e.g. Ashour et al., 2003 ; Hong and Bhamidimarri, the axial capacity of driven piles in cohesive soils has been correlated with CPT data using a developed version of genetic programming that is gene expression programming (GEP).
Recently, GEP has been applied with success in solving engineering problems (e.g. Bayksoglu et al., 2008 ; Civic and Cabalar, 2009) . The objectives of this paper are as follows:
Investigate the feasibility of using gene expression program-ming to correlate CPT data and pile capacity.

Evaluate the performance of the developed GEP model in training and validation sets and via sensitivity analysis.
Compare the accuracy of the GEP model with accuracies of number of currently adopted CPT-based methods 2. Overview of gene expression programming
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are computing search techniques that are based on the principles of genetics and natural selection. In these techniques, the computer implements some of the natural evolutionary mechanisms (such as selection, crossover and mutation) to solve a function identification problem. The first version of the evolutionary techniques is the genetic algorithms (GAs), which was introduced by Holland (1975) and developed by Goldberg (1989) .
GAs are generally used in parameters X  optimizations in which solutions to a problem are encoded in linear symbolic strings usually (0 s and 1 s) and candidate population of these solutions is left to evolve so that the best solution to the problem at hand is reached. invented by Cramer (1985) and further developed by Koza (1992) .
GP utilizes the same concept adapted by the GAs in developing a problem solution using the same tools of selection and genetic modification to evolve randomly created computer programs (also called individuals or chromosomes) proposed to solve a certain problem. However, the fundamental difference between the two algorithms resides in the nature of individuals. In GAs, individuals are linear strings of fixed length while in GP individuals are nonlinear entities of different sizes and shapes ( Ferreira, 2001 ). present work is a further development in genetic programming (GP) and was developed by Ferreira (2001) . The main strength of the GEP over the GP is the ability to deal with very complex problems and develop solutions much quicker. For instance, the most complex problem presented to the GEP is the evolution of cellular automata rules for the density-classification task. The GEP was found to surpass the GP by more than four orders of magnitude.
 chromosomes) that are encoded linearly in chromosomes of fixed length, and are expressed nonlinearly in the form of expression trees (ETs) of different sizes and shapes. The chromosomes are composed of a gene or multiple genes; each gene is encoded in a smaller sub-program. Every gene has a constant length and includes a head that contains functions and terminals, and a tail that composes of terminals only. The genetic code represents a one-to-one relationship between the symbols of the chromosome, the functions or terminals. The process of information decoding from chromosomes to expression trees is called translation, which is based on sets of rules that determine the spatial organization of the function and terminals in the ETs and the type of interaction (link) between the sub-ETs ( Ferreira, 2002 ).
 developing problem X  X  solution begin swithcreatinganinitialpopula-tion of computer programs randomly chosen from sets of functions and terminals. The functions can contain basic mathematical opera-tors (e.g.  X  , , , /) or any other user defined functions, whereas the terminals can consist of numerical constants, logical constants or variables. Each program (chromosome) is executed and its fitness is evaluated through the fitness function, which measures how good the chromosome is at competition wi th the rest of population. Then, chromosomes are selected for fur ther development based on their fitness. The ones that have higher fitness are given more chance for being reselected, the low fitness chromosomes, on the other hand, are deleted or given a slim chance for reselection. The selected programs are then subjected to further developments, which are performed through the genetic variations such as mutation and recombination. New offspring of chromosomes with new traits are generated and used to replace the existing population. The chromo-somes of the new generation are then subjected to the same developmental process, which is repeated until stopping criteria are satisfied. The principal terms of GEP are described as follows:
Initial population : In GEP, function finding begins when a number of computer programs (individuals or chromosomes) referred to as initial population are randomly created from the set of functions and terminals defined by the user. Each program is expressed, evaluated and assigned fitness according to how well it performs towards the desired objective.

Genes and expression trees : Gene is a sub-programs encoded in the chromosome that has a fixed length and composed of a head and a tail. The length of the head is usually predefined by the user during data setting, while the length of the tail is determined from t  X  h  X  n 1  X  X  1  X  1  X  where t is the tail length; h is the head length and n is the number of function arguments. A typical GEP gene is written as follows: mark between the symbols; sqrt is the square root function; c1 is a constant; and d0 , d1 ,and d2 are variables known as terminals. The symbols (  X  .sqrt.c1.  X  . ./. ) represent the gene X  X  head, while the symbols ( d0.d1.d2.d0.d1.d1.d2 ) represent the gene X  X  tail. This written format is named K -expression or Karva notation ( Ferreira, 2002 ), which can be converted into the expression tree, ET, as shown in Fig. 2 . The tree represents a spatial illustration that illustrates the interactions among the gene X  X  components on the mapofsolution.

Mutation : In GEP, mutation means randomly selecting any component of the gene X  X  head or tail and replacing it with any other randomly selected component from the function or terminal set. In the heads, any component can change into another (function or terminal), whereas in the tails terminals can only change into terminals. The mutation may take place at one or two points within the chromosome and there are no constraints, neither in the kind of mutation nor the number of mutations. In all cases, the newly created individuals are syntactically correct programs.
Recombination : The last significant step during each cycle of programs evolution includes introducing genetic variations by recombination. The variations take place when two chromosomes are paired and split exactly at the same point to exchange their ingredients downward to the merging point. The following steps explain how recombination is performed:
Two chromosomes are selected randomly from the population; one part of each chromosome is selected randomly; the two chromosomes pair and trade in the selected parts and two offspring belonging to the new population are obtained. 3. Development of GEP model
The GEP model developed in this work is based on results of a number of 25 pile load tests and cone penetration test (CPT) data.
The CPT-based pile capacity prediction methods have become desirable worldwide and preferred over other methods, as the CPT provides more reliable soil properties. For instance, the CPT can be carried out on soils e.g. cohesionless soils from which it is difficult to obtain undisturbed samples.

In this work, the GEP model is developed using the commercial available software package GeneXproTools 4.0 ( Gepsoft, 2001 ). The data used to develop the model were collected from the literature, mainly in-situ compression and tension pile load tests and CPT data, reported by Eslami (1996) . The piles are loaded incrementally in slow or quick maintained loads. In total 22 piles (88%) of the available piles are loaded in slow maintained loads and 3 piles (12%) of the piles are loaded in quick maintained loads. The tests were performed on driven piles, made of concrete or steel, embedded in cohesive soils. The piles have different sizes and shapes with diameters ranging from 273 to 800 mm, and lengths from 5.5 to 37.5 m. As thepilesconsideredinthecurrentstudyhaveawidediameters X  range and because the large-diameter piles may behave differently in comparison to small-diameter piles, they were classified into two categories: small-diameter piles (for pile diameter o 600 mm) and large-diameter piles (for pile diameter 4 600 mm). This classification is in accordance with Ng et al. (2004) . 3.1. Model input and output
The most significant factors that influence pile capacity prediction were presented to the GEP model as potential model inputs. These include the equivalent pile diameter, D eq , which was calculated as perimeter/ p , pile embedment length, L , weighted average cone point The pile material was translated from text to numerical format by representing the steel by 1 and the concrete by 2. The GEP is capable to deal with such kind of variable representation. The interpreted failure load (pile capacity), Q u , is the single model output. The following conditions were applied to the input and output.
The interpreted failure load (pile capacity), Q u was taken in accordance with Eslami (1996) as plunging load in well defined failure cases or the 80% Criterion of Hansen (1963) for the cases that failure load is not clearly defined. Figs. 3 and 4 present the definition of the failure load for two case records selected from the database.

For small-diameter piles, the failure zone over which q c averaged was taken in accordance with Eslami (1996) ,in which when the pile tip is located in a homogenous soil, the failure zone extends 4 D eq below and above the pile tip, whereas when the pile tip is located in a strong soil layer underneath a weak soil layer, the failure zone extend from 4
D eq below and 8 D eq above the pile tip. On the other hand, when the pile tip is located in a weak soil layer beneath strong soil layer, the failure zone extends from 4 D eq below to 2 D above the pile tip. For large-diameter piles, however, the failure zone is taken in accordance with Alsamman (1995) to be 1 D eq below the pile tip.

As several pile case records include mechanical rather than electric CPT data, it was necessary to transform the mechanical
CPT readings into equivalent electric CPT values. This was carried out using the correlation proposed by Kulhawy and
Mayne (1990) , as follows: q p where; p a is the atmospheric pressure and q c is the cone point resistance; both of p a and q c are in kPa.

For f s values, the mechanical cones give higher readings than the electric cones in all soils. Kulhawy and Mayne (1990) suggested a 3.2. Data division
The next step in development of the GEP model is the data division. In this work, the data were randomly divided into two statistically consisten t sets, as recommended by Masters (1993) and calibration and an independent validation set for model verification. training and 4 cases (16%) for validation. The statistics of the data used for the training and validation sets are given in Table 1 ,which include the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and best in interpretation rather than extrapolation, thus, the extreme values of the data used are included in the training set. 3.3. Determination of GEP setting parameters and model selection
The search for the GEP settings parameters and the selection of the model is carried out in three stages as follows: 3.3.1. Determination the values of setting parameters
In GEP, values of setting parameters have significant influence on the fitness of the output model. These include the number of chromosomes, number of genes and gene X  X  head size, functions + / set, linking function and the rate of genetic operators. In this work, the trial-and-error approach was used to determine the values of setting parameters. This approach involved using different settings and conducting runs in steps. During each step, runs were carried out and the values of one of the above mentioned parameters (with its optimal value being searched) were varied, whereas the values of the other parameters were set constant (i.e. number of chromosomes  X  30, number of genes  X  3, gene X  X  head size  X  8, functions set  X  X  , , , and /, fitness function  X  mean squared error (MSE), linking function  X  X  , mutation  X  0.04, and gene recombination  X  0.1). The runs were stopped after thirty thousand generations, which were found sufficient to evaluate the fitness of the output. At the end of each run, the MSE for both training and validation sets were recorded in order to identify the values that give the least MSE. In the first step, the number of chromosomes was determined.
Several runs were conducted varying the number of chromo-somes (i.e. 15, 16, 17, y , 25), whereas the other parameters were set constants. The number of chromosomes that was found to correspond to the least MSE in both of the training and the validation sets was selected.

In the same way, the chromosome architecture, i.e. the head size and number of genes per chromosome, were determined. Several runs were carried out using the gene X  X  head size  X  6, 7, 8, y , 14, and number of genes per chromosome  X  1, 2, 3, y 5. The fitness of the output of the runs was then compared to determine the optimum chromosome X  X  architecture.
 In the following step the best set of functions was determined. The initial run began with the use of the four basic arithmetic operators (  X  , , , /). Then in the subsequent run an additional function such as root square was added to the set and so on. Then the addition and the multiplication linking functions were used in different runs to determine which of these functions best suits this problem. The last step was to search for the best rates of each of the genetic operators. The focus was more on mutation and gene recombination, as they are the main gene modifiers.
The results of the search for model setting parameters are shown in Figs. 5 X 9 . Fig. 5 shows that the model performs best when the number of chromosomes is 22, in dicating that this number of chromosomes is the optimal. Itcanalsobeseenthat,in Figs. 6 and 7 , the optimum chromosome structure consists of 3 genes of head size  X  10. Above these values the fitness of the model decreases. This can be because of using too long gene; the genetic variations may takeplaceinregionswheretheyhaveminoreffectontheevolution process. The functions group that produced the best output fitness function such as the Ln (natural l ogarithm) among the functions group is recognizable in the models of the evolutionary algorithms. During evolution process, this func tion is selected randomly by the program to improve the fitness of t he solution. The results also showed that the model performs better when the addition (  X  )is used as a linking function. Figs. 8 and 9 present the influence of the rates of the genetic operators  X  m utation and gene recombination  X  on the performance of the GEP model. It can be seen that the GEP model performs best when mutation and gene recombination rates are 0.05 and 0.3, respectively.

After finding the best setting parameters, the GEP model was determined by conducting several runs using these parameters.
The outputs of the runs were several chromosomes (models) which represent potential solutions to the problem. The best model was determined by screening these solutions through selection criteria which are defined as follows: first, the model has to have correla-
Second, it has to have mean values within 10%. Third, it must give results that agree with what is expected in the sensitivity analysis, which is explained later. The desirable criteria of the model are to provide short and simple expressions. 3.3.3. Optimization and simplification of the GEP model
The third stage was to develop the model that is selected from the previous stage. The model that satisfied selection criteria was further developed with the optimization and simplification pro-cedures, which are available in the program. The best model settings are presented in Table 2 . 4. Results and evaluation performance of the GEP model 4.1. GEP output and model formulation
As mentioned earlier, one of the advantages of the GEP technique is that the relationship between the model inputs and the corresponding outputs is automatically constructed in the expression trees as presented in Fig. 10 . The trees are easily formulated into mathematical equation as follows:
Q  X  f s  X  2  X  Mat  X  2  X   X  X  D eq where Q p is the predicted pile capacity; D eq is the equivalent pile diameter; L is the pile embedment length; q c tip is the weighted average cone point resistance over pile tip failure zone; f weighted average sleeve friction along shaft; q c shaft is the weighted average cone point resistance over shaft length; E is the pile elastic modulus and Mat , is the pile Material (for steel  X  1 and for concrete  X  2).

Table 3 indicates that the model performs well with high coefficients of correlation, r , of 0.95 and 0.94 for the training and validation sets, respectively. It can also be seen that the model has good mean values, of 0.95 and 1.09 for the training and validation sets, respectively.

 around the line of equality between the measured and predicted pile capacities for the training and validation sets. The above results demonstrate that the developed GEP model performs well. 4.3. Sensitivity analysis model further, sensitivity analysis was carried out. A set of a hypothetical input that lies within the range of the training data, was used to verify the response of the GEP model to the variations of the input variables. For example, the effect of one input variable, while all other input variables were set to selected constant values.
The inputs were then accommodated in the GEP model, and the predicted pile capacity was calculated. This process was repeated for the next input variable and so on, until the model response had been examined for all inputs. The robustness of the GEP model was determined by examining how well the predictions compare with available geotechnical knowledge and experimental data. The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Fig. 12 . It can be seen that predictions of pile capacity from the GEP model agree well with what one would expect and with published experimental results in sense that the pile capacity increases with the increase of the pile diameter, embedment length, average of sleeve friction and average of cone point resistance within pile tip influence zone and along shaft. It can also be seen that concrete piles are higher capacity than steel piles. This can be attributed to the roughness of the pile surface, which is higher in the concrete than in the steel piles. The results of the sensitivity analysis pro-vide an additional confirmatio n that the developed GEP model perform well. 4.4. Comparison of the GEP model with number of CPT-based methods
To examine the accuracy of the GEP model further, the predictions of the model were compared with those obtained from three of currently adopted CPT-based methods including De
Ruiter and Beringen (1979) , Bustamante and Gianeselli (1982) and Esalmi, Fellenius (1997) . The predictions of the GEP model are also compared with predictions of artificial neural network model developed by Shahin (2010) . A brief description of the compared methods is provided in Table 4 .

Statistical analyses including the coefficient of correlation, the mean and the cumulative probability at 50% ( P 50 ) from the GEP model and the CPT methods, in relation to the available 25 case records, were carried out and the results are presented graphi-cally in Fig. 13 and numerically in Table 5 . The cumulative probability, P 50 , is calculated from Eq. (6) by sorting the values of predicted capacity by measured capacity ( Q p / Q m ) in an ascend-ing order for each method. The smallest Q p / Q m is given number i  X  1 and the largest is given i  X  n. The value of Q p / Q corresponds to P  X  50% is considered as P 50 P  X  i
Fig. 13 illustrates that the GEP model has the minimum scatter around the line of equality between measured and predicted pile capacity. The numerical values as presented in Table 5 indicate that the model performs well in comparison with the other methods. It can be seen that for the all data set and validation set the performance of the GEP model is high and consistent. This indicates that the GEP model is accurate and has a good capability to generalize. Moreover Table 5 also shows that the overall results of performance measurements may suggest that the GEP model may tends to under-predict the measured pile capacity. The comparison gives additional confirmation to the ability of the GEP model to perform well and suggests that it can be used as additional alternative to predict pile capacity. 4.5. Some setbacks of GEP
Although the above results demonstrate that the developed model performs well, GEP involve some deficiencies.

The GEP approach is data driven. The accuracy of the GEP model depends on the accuracy of the data input. In addition, the GEP models cannot extrapolate the answer (i.e. can only provide predictions within the range of the training data).
 The size of the solution increases with the increase of fitness.
Significant number of runs may be required to obtain a suitable answer for complex problem. 5. Conclusion
The results of this study indicate that the GEP model possess a good capability in predicting the capacity of driven piles in cohesive soils; the model has achieved high coefficients of correlation, r , of 0.95 for the data used in model calibration, and 0.94 for the data used in model validation. The model has also low mean, m , values of 0.94 and 1.09 for the data used in model calibration and validation, respectively. Sensitivity analysis has revealed that pile capacity increase with increase of the input variables, which also have different levels of influence on capa-city. The results also demonstrate that GEP model performs well in comparison with the CPT-based methods. Overall, the output of this study has demonstrated that while the GEP approach involves some insignificant setbacks, resulting model is compe-tent in correlating between pile capacity and CPT data.
