 Ancient language manuscripts constitute a key part of the cultural heritage for mankind. As one of the four ancient civilizations and currently also one of the most widely used languages, Chinese historical calligraphy work has contributed to not only traditional Chinese cultural heritage but the world civilization at large. In particu-lar, many Asian cultures and languages have been evolved from those of China [Wiki 2010]. To effectively protect these works from ruining and damages, many of them have been digitized for permanent storage (cf. Figure 1) and become foundations of Asian cultural research [Zhang 1992]. Therefore, the issue of indexing and retrieval of such digital works becomes new key challenges. State-of-the-art character indexing and re-trieval methods often just use contour points extracted from a character as features in similarity-based retrieval processes [Shi et al. 2001; Zhuang et al. 2007]. Other key features of Chinese characters including style , type , and even sentiment that is con-veyed by the artistic character writing have not been explored systematically [Zhuang et al. 2011]. These features not only are common user selection criteria in applications such as culture education and general appreciation but also serve as effective retrieval metrics to prune search space in the retrieval process.

In essence, efficient retrieval of Chinese calligraphic characters directly relates to the category of high-dimensional data indexing with multiple features. Although there are considerable research efforts on the high-dimensional indexing issues [B  X  ohm et al. 2001], unfortunately, existing indexing methods cannot be directly applied to Chinese calligraphic characters [Zhuang et al. 2011]. In our previous work [Zhuang et al. 2011], we studied Chinese character retrieval and its indexing algorithms only based on their contour similarity measure. However, as illustrated with the character  X  each character can be written in many different types (such as Kai Shu and Li Shu in Figure 2) and many different styles (such as Yan Ti and Mi Ti in Figure 3). In most cases, users would like to get some result characters of their preferred style( s )or type( s ), which can also be employed as effective pruning criteria for reducing the search space. Furthermore, there is also a subjective feature called sentiment conveyed by a character as shown in Figure 4, which has its cultural importance. In the prolonged feudal times, the creativity, imagination, and personality of the literati were confined in the ideology framework built up by the governing groups. During these periods, Chinese calligraphy was the main outlet for expressing personal emotions and senti-ments. During each relatively open dynasty or period (such as Tang dynasty and Song dynasty), the Running Character ( Xing Shu ) and Cursive Character ( Cao Shu ) were thriving, resulting in many grand master calligraphists and many fine works. With the simple yet expressive lines, a calligrapher could freely express his creativity and imag-ination, conveying his individual character and sentiments, and therefore could enjoy the pleasure of living or strongly feel his self-existence during writing [Wiki 2010]. So we include the subjective feature of sentiment (cf. Table III) to denote the writers X  emotions.

Due to the shape complexity of Chinese calligraphic characters, personal knowledge level and errors occurred in the feature extraction (as shown in Tables I X  X II for the ex-ample character  X   X   X  or  X  X ook X ), identifying its corresponding features (e.g., character therefore often not so high. For example, for the character in Table II, the probabilities of the character styles Yan Ti , Mi Ti, and Liu Ti are 10%, 85%, and 5%, respectively. Since these three features are somehow subjective, it is important to introduce a prob-abilistic model for modeling the character features in order to further improve the retrieval accuracy.

Furthermore, most of the state-of-the-art retrieval methods focus on retrieving the characters in a centralized way (mainly single-PC-based), which cannot be scaled up well to large data volume. The retrieval efficiencies of these centralized methods are unsatisfactory because the response time is at least linearly increasing with the size of the searched file. Therefore the design and development of high performance character image retrieval methods becomes vital. The advent of cloud computing technique pro-vides a promising way to further speed up and scale up the retrieval of large Chinese calligraphic character image repositories. As one of the cloud computing techniques, a mobile cloud network ( M CN ) can be regarded as a type of flexible computing infras-tructure consisting of many computing nodes, which can provide resizable computing capacities to different users anywhere anytime. To fully harness the M cient data management is needed to handle huge volumes of manuscript image data and support a large number of concurrent end users. In addition, the M provides us with location-based retrieval support that enables users to retrieve char-acter images conveniently. To achieve this, scalable, high-throughput, location-based retrieval, and indexing schemes are generally required. As one of the ubiquitous media retrievals, however, for M CN -based probabilistic character image retrieval processing, exploring parallelism in the M CN to speed up the retrievals is a new research topic, which has received little attention so far. The challenges include three main aspects. (1) High computation cost in calligraphic character image retrieval . Most character (2) Mobility of M CN users . Most users in the M CN are constantly moving. That means (3) Instability and heterogeneity of the M CN . The nodes in the M
To address these challenges, we propose an efficient Distributed Probabilistic sim-ilarity Retrieval processing technique for Chinese calligraphic character images in the mobile C loud environment called D PRC . In particular, to adaptively perform the data transmission process within a reasonable time, progressively reduce the com-munication cost in the M CN environment, and improve user experiences, the D includes four enabling techniques, namely, (1) dual-reference-learning ( D probability propagation ,(2) optimal data placement scheme ,(3) adaptive data trans-mission scheme ,and(4) index support dataset reduction scheme . To facilitate index support character dataset reduction processing, further extending our previous work on the shape-similarity-based retrieval algorithm for the Chinese calligraphic char-acter [Zhuang et al. 2005, 2007], we propose in this article a M ultiple F eature-based P robabilistic Tree high-dimensional indexing scheme called M multiple features. With the aid of the M FP -Tree, irrelevant characters in the master node or nearest slave node level can be efficiently and safely discarded, thereby re-ducing the transmission bandwidth and achieving efficient retrieval. We have im-plemented the D PRC method with extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach is specifically suitable for large high-dimensional image data queries. The major tasks and contributions of our work in this article are as follows. (1) We introduce a framework of an efficient distributed large Chinese calligraphic (2) We propose four enabling techniques to facilitate the efficient D (3) We conduct extensive experimental studies to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency,
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some closely related work by others. In Section 3, we provide the preliminaries and the prob-lem formulation. We present a system framework in Section 4. In Section 5, we pro-pose four enabling techniques to efficiently support the D we describe the D PRC processing method. In Section 7, we report the results of some extensive experiments to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach. Finally, we conclude in section 8 with discussions and our future research directions. In this section, we review some previous research efforts on retrieval of historical manuscript images, high-dimensional indexes, and image transmission techniques, respectively. Numerous promising research works have been performed on the handwriting recog-nition [Palmondon and Srihari 2000]. For example, two word-matching technologies were used to recognize George Washington X  X  manuscripts [Rath et al. 2004], and to identify the historical Hebrew manuscripts [Yosef et al. 2004]. Rabaev et al. [2011] presented a retrieval approach for the Hebrew manuscripts. Japanese and Korean re-searchers also developed specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphies, and applied to specific scripts. Japanese calligraphy extends Han (Chinese) characters to include also local scripts of Hiragana and Katakana. For example, Nakagawa and Onuma [2003] proposed an on-line hand-written Japanese text recognition algorithm, which is free from constraints on line direction and character orientation. In the case of Korean calligraphy, the Hangeul and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique [Wiki 2010]. In [Asi et al. 2011; Saabni and Sana 2009], recognition methods were proposed for comparing two Arabic historic manuscript images. Pal et al. [2012] reviewed the offline handwriting recognition techniques for Indian regional scripts. However, these techniques do not tackle the complexity of calligraphy retrieval re-quirements of Chinese characters.

For the Chinese character calligraphy, Shi et al. [2001] presented a content-based retrieval method for antique books, but it is unknown how well this rigid visual similarity-based method can work on retrieving Chinese calligraphic characters in dif-ferent dynasties with different styles and types of handwritings. Belongie et al. [2002] proposed an inspirational approach similar to ours, yet it is much more complex for the sake of calligraphic character retrieval. Other work includes applying the Pro-jecting method [Wu and Ding 1992] and the Earth Movers X  Distance (EMD) method [Cohen and Guibas 1999] to Chinese calligraphic character retrieval. These two recog-nition techniques, however, are still too rigid to be applied to the retrieval process of large calligraphic character repositories. Recently, Zeng et al. [2008] proposed a Markov random field (MRF) -based statistical character structure modeling for hand-written Chinese character recognition, which, however, can not accurately capture the character style. Little research work, however, has been performed successfully on multi-feature-based Chinese calligraphic character probabilistic retrieval because it significantly differs from the state-of-the-art Chinese calligraphic character retrieval which only focused on the shape similarity.

One of the key problems in Chinese calligraphic characters retrieval is the similarity matching of isolated character images. In this section, we review a shape-similarity ( SS )-based retrieval method from our previous work [Zhuang et al. 2005, 2007]. Note that, since this article only focuses on the probabilistic retrieval processing in mobile network environment, due to limited space, the preprocessing step including image binarization and the extraction of the characters in the manuscripts is not described again. Please refer to our previous work [Zhuang et al. 2005].

First, we briefly introduce the notations that will be used in the rest of the article (Table IV).

For calligraphic character retrieval, shapes are far more interesting than colors and textures. Therefore we proposed a shape similarity based retrieval method that uses contour points to describe the shape. Before giving the definition of approximate point context, we show how an original isolated calligraphic character (ref. Figure 5(a) is represented in the space (ref. Figure 5(b)).

Since character images are represented by pixels (or points), the polar coordinate is more suitable to describe directional relationship of points than the Cartesian one, as shown in Figure 5(b). For directions, we use 8 bins in the same degree to divide the whole space into 8 regions (i.e., directions). As for radius, 4 bins are used with respect to the values of log 2 r (e.g., in our case the isolated character images are scaled to 32  X  32, so the chord is divided when r = 2, r = 4, r = 8, r
Definition 1 . For each point p i of a given point set composed of m sampled points of with the remainder ( m-1 ) points using coarse k bins: where p i is the i-th point that we are computing for the point context, and k refers to the k -th bin of point p i .

Note that due to the shape complexity of every character, the number of contour points of each character image, m , is also different. Figure 5(b) shows an example of how these bins are built and computed for a calligraphic character.

For each point q i of the retrieval character  X  q ,point p matches the point q i if and only if the following constraint is satisfied: where ( x i , y i )and( x j , y j ) denote the positions of points q and  X  is an empirical value typically set to 1/4 [Zhuang et al. 2005].

Let M C ij = M C ( q i , p j ) be the matching cost of two points: q value of such two points is defined as where w i ( k ) , w j ( k ) are the bin values in the histograms at point q spectively. For each given point q i in the retrieval point set, if the point p minimum matching cost with point q i , then it is regarded as the approximate corre-spondence point for q i since, in reality, there is no exact corresponding point except for the case that the candidate image is the same as the retrieval one. Therefore, the minimum point matching cost for q i is as follows:
Finally, the total matching cost of the two character images (i.e., defined as where | q i -corresp ( q i ) | 2 is the Euclidean distance between point q corresponding point corresp ( q i ) in a candidate calligraphic character weight factor which is set to 0.1 empirically through our previous experiments.
For Chinese calligraphic character indexing, Zhuang et al. [2005] first proposed a similarity retrieval processing of the Chinese calligraphic character images in which no indexing scheme is considered. In order to improve the retrieval efficiency, Zhuang et al. [2007] presented an interactive indexing method for Chinese character image retrieval. Both of them, however, focused on just a single feature of contour points indexing. Moreover, uncertainty of feature extraction from character images is often neglected, which has been proven to be inherently important in many recognition ap-plications. So we extended this indexing method [Zhuang et al. 2005, 2007] to cover multiple features (such as type , style , and even sentiment ) and proposed a composite high-dimensional index structure that can facilitate unified probabilistic retrieval via different features [Zhuang et al. 2011]. There is a long stream of research on addressing high-dimensional indexing problems based on data partitioning, while the K-D-B-tree [Robinson 1981], the hB-tree [Lomet and Salzberg 1990] and the LSDh-tree [Henrich 1998] are based on space partitioning by using hierarchical tree index structures. However, their performance deteriorates rapidly as dimensionality increases, due to the  X  dimensionality curse  X  X B  X  ohm et al. 2001]. Another category is to represent original feature vectors using smaller, approx-imate representations such as VA-file [Weber et al. 1998] and IQ-tree [Berchtold et al. 2000]. Although these methods can accelerate the sequential scan by using data com-pression, they incur higher computational cost due to decoding the bit-string. These two categories of indexing approaches are suitable only for indexing the multidimen-sional data with fixed dimensionality, and do not fit for indexing Chinese character features since almost every character has different number of contour points ( dimen-sionalities ). The distance-based approach (e.g., iDistance [Jagadish et al. 2005]) may be a promising scheme to indexing since it does not heavily depend on the dimension-alities of the characters.

To the best of our knowledge, few research works have been touched on indexing multiple features with uncertainty so far, and no research effort has been made in the sentiment issue of Chinese calligraphic character. Image data transmission techniques have been studied for about 20 years [Allcocka et al. 2002; Chang et al. 2002, 2008; Chang and Wu 2003; Charles et al. 1992; Gao et al. 2010; Kim and Song 1996; Lin et al. 2005; Raman et al. 2000]. The state-of-the-art methods can be mainly divided into two categories: 1) improvement design of trans-mission protocol [Allcocka et al. 2002; Charles et al. 1992; Danskin et al. 1995; Gao et al. 2010; Raman et al. 2000]; and 2) image data encoding and compression [Chang et al. 1999, 2002, 2008; Chang and Wu 2003; Kim and Song 1996; Lin et al. 2005; Ruiz et al. 2001; Tzou 1987].

Charles et al. [1992] first proposed a wireless image data transmission method from end to end with some experimental analysis. As images are usually transmitted across the Internet using a lossless protocol such as TCP/IP, which requires retransmission of lost packets, this substantially increases transmission time. Danskin et al. [1995] presented a lossy Internet image transmission scheme (FLIIT) for compressed images, which eliminates retransmission delays by strategically shielding important portions of the image with redundant bits. They described a joint source and channel coding algorithm for images which minimizes the expected distortion of transmitted images. After that, Raman et al. [2000] proposed an image transmission protocol called ITP. Comparing with the traditional TCP protocol, the ITP is more suitable for image data transmission. Packet losses decrease the quality of image or video in multimedia ap-plications. Robustness to packet losses is crucial to high quality image transmission in the Internet or wireless channels where data loss often happens. Gao et al. [2010] pro-posed a robust image transmission scheme for wireless channels based on compressive sensing.

Since most image transmission methods use the same pixel interpolation scheme for the entire picture, without considering the differences in different portions, Chang et al. [2008] presented a progressive image transmission (PIT) scheme which transmits the most significant portion of a picture, followed by less important parts. Lin and Hao [2005] presented a compound image compression algorithm for real-time appli-cations of computer screen image transmission called Shape Primitive Extraction and Coding (SPEC). Ruiz et al. [2001] designed an image compression algorithm to sup-port progressive image transmission. Available PIT mechanisms and systems can be categorized into spatial domain [Chang et al. 1999], and pyramid-structured progres-sive transmission [Kim and Song 1996]. In the transform domain, an image undergoes block compression and the transformed coefficients are transmitted progressively in a relative importance order (e.g., Progressive JPEG). Alternately, a germinal and in-stinctive method for progressive image transmission in the spatial domain is the Bit Plane Method (BPM) [Chang and Wu 2003; Tzou 1987]. In such scheme, the final trans-mitted image is the same as the original. However, its high transmission bit rate is a major disadvantage of BPM. Due to the drawback of BPM, lossy PIT techniques have received more attention. Chang et al. [2002] provided a fast PIT scheme to improve the BPM method by color guessing called the guessing by neighbors (GBN), which uses in-terleaved pixels for transmission. Fifty percent of the pixels are transmitted while the other fifty percent were  X  X uessed X .

Different from the given state-of-the-art methods, the article proposes a content-aware and bandwidth-conscious image data transmission method for large scale character manuscript image databases by analyzing the image content and network bandwidth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to improve the trans-mission performance from a perspective of data level. Due to the feature characteristics of Chinese calligraphic character images, there are different styles , types , and even sentiments , respectively (see Figures 2 X 4) for a sin-gle character. To embed the previous feature information for effective pruning of the search region, we propose a probabilistic retrieval scheme in which the shape similar-ity matching algorithm is extended from our previous work [Zhuang et al. 2005, 2007]. We also add the identification of the style , type ,and sentiment of the character with user probabilistic guarantee in a preprocessing step.

Definition 2 . A character  X  i can be modeled by a five-tuple: where  X  i refers to the i -th character in ;  X  Shap e denotes the contour points extracted from  X  i ;  X  Style ={ StyID , P S } , where StyID is the style ID of  X  Type ={ TyID , P T } , where TyID is the type ID of  X  i  X  Sent ={ SeID , P E } , where SeID is the sentiment ID of
Definition 3 . A mobile cloud network ( M CN ) is a graph which is represented by a triplet: where N refers to the set of nodes, E refers to a set of edges representing the network bandwidths for data transfer at T which means the time.
 In the given definition, due to the instability and heterogeneity of the M ment, the bandwidth of any two nodes in M CN may be different and variant with the change of the time.

Definition 4 . The nodes in M CN can be logically divided into four categories: user node ( N U ), hub node ( N H ) , master node ( N M ) , and slave node N = N  X  slave nodes ( N j S ) , respectively, for i  X  [1,  X  ], j  X 
As defined earlier, in a M CN , a user node layer is responsible for the submission of the retrieval character: the master nodes in the M CN are responsible for whole data storage, indexing and data filtering; the slave nodes are responsible for storing and indexing the partial yet  X  X ot X  character image data that can be quickly fetched by users nearby; and the hub nodes are responsible for retrieval routing.
 Based on this definitions, the problem formulation of the D The following are the two examples of the probabilistic retrieval.

R 1 . For a retrieval character  X  q and a radius r , return the characters the probability of its type being  X  X ai Shu X  is larger than Formally, R 1 can be represented as follows:
R 2 . For a retrieval character  X  q and a radius r , the probability that its type name is  X  X ai Shu X  and its style name is  X  X ong Ti X  is larger than  X  R 2 can be formally represented as follows:
The objective of our proposed D PRC method is to efficiently answer the retrieval results in the mobile cloud environment with optimized data communication and CPU costs. In this section we give an overview of the proposed system architecture for the indexing and the distributed retrieval processing of a Chinese calligraphic character database, as shown in Figure 6.

In the preprocessing step, a large number of Chinese calligraphic scripts are first scanned as raw data, and the scanned images are then isolated into individual char-acters before being saved in the Chinese calligraphic character database ( ). Then, the contour points of each character in are extracted, and are saved in the back-end database (in particular, SQL server). After that, four other subjective features such as type , style ,and sentiment are identified and computed manually or automatically, which are recorded in the feature probability distribution tables (F Once the given feature extraction processing is completed, a multiple-feature-based high dimensional index method called multifeature probabilistic tree (M constructed and deployed to support fast dataset reduction processing of the Chinese calligraphic characters at the affected master nodes and the nearest slave node (to be discussed in Section 5.4).

For the D PRC processing, a user can submit a retrieval requests in two ways: via example-based or sketch-based retrieval . The retrieval request is first sent to the hub node by the wireless handle devices (e.g., mobile phone, iPad, etc.) in which the contour points of the retrieval character has been extracted. In the hub node, the identification processing is invoked to identify if the nearest slave node of the user node contains the partial candidate result characters and which master nodes are involved in the D processing. Thus, the result character images can be obtained through the filtering and refinement processing with the aid of the MFP-Tree indexes at the nearest slave node and the affected master nodes respectively in parallel. Finally, they are sent to the user node. In this section, we introduce four enabling techniques: 1) the D propagation, 2) optimal data placement scheme, 3) adaptive image block data robust transmission algorithm, and 4) index support dataset reduction scheme. To facilitate probabilistic retrieval of Chinese calligraphic images, for each character, it is vital to model the probabilistic distributions for multiple features as mentioned earlier. So in this section, we first propose a feature probabilistic distribution table (F
PDT ) for each character image. To obtain n F PDT s of all character images, a dual-reference-learning ( D RL )-based probability propagation method is next introduced. 5.1.1. The F PDT . As mentioned before, for each character some confidence guarantees are important to effectively support the probabilistic char-acter retrieval with multiple features. Therefore, as a preprocessing step in the re-trieval process, it is critical to build a feature probabilistic distribution table (F for each character, as defined here.
 Definition 5 ( Feature Probabilistic Distribution Table, F tic distribution table of the i-th character, denoted as F where Fname j is the j -th feature name, Fvalue j is the corresponding feature value for equals to Fvalue j .

To obtain the corresponding F PDT for a given character, in this section, we propose a collaborative-tagging (cTag) -based approach to generate the F example of the four F PDTS of the character  X   X   X . Assume that t users are involved in of different features for this character. Then, we calculate the feature values of the character by the t users to obtain the average feature probabilistic distributions with Equation (9).

Prob j = Pr ( the average probability that the value of the j -th feature equals to Fvalue where U i  X  Fvalue means the i -th user chooses Fvalue of the j -th feature.
Motivations. As we know, for n characters in , it is labor-intensive to obtain the n feature probabilistic distribution tables manually. So in the preprocessing step, in order to obtain the F PDT of each character, we adopt a dual reference-learning ( D based derivation method, in which m characters ( m &lt;&lt; the n characters in as reference ones (  X  R these m reference ones can be manually obtained by the collaborative tagging ap-proach (as in Section 5.1.1). Given an unlabeled character image of this method is to derive its corresponding F PDT of a character via its two nearest neighboring reference ones in distance.

The Algorithm. As mentioned before, the m F PDT s for the reference characters are manually obtained by the collaborative tagging approach. Based on that, we are in the position to study how to automatically obtain other ( n -m )F reference ones via using the D RL -based probability propagation method.
Once m reference F PDT s are constructed, we derive other ( n -m ) characters via their two nearest neighbor reference ones(  X  R ). First, let  X  i feature of  X  i , 1NN(  X  i ) and 2NN(  X  i ) be the two nearest neighbor reference characters of  X  i in distance. Then, the probability that the j -th feature value of approximately derived as follows.

As shown in Figure 8, Equation (10) is based on an intuition that the more similar in shape the two characters are, the more approximate the probabilities that their two corresponding features equal to a same feature value are
Solving Equation (10), the probability that the feature( X )of represented in Equation (11).
 where  X  X can be either type , style ,or sentiment ;  X  X f X refers to style ,then Y can be  X  Yan Ti  X ,  X  Liu Ti  X ,  X  Cai Ti  X ,  X  Su Ti  X , etc.;  X  X f X refers to sentiment ,then Y can be  X  Heroic  X ,  X  Cautious  X ,  X  Peaceful  X , etc. For example, suppose there are seven characters such as  X  and  X  R3 in which three characters (e.g.,  X  R1 ,  X  R2 and ones, as shown in Figure 9. For character  X  3 , assume that Sim ( Sim (  X  3 ,  X  R2 ) = 0.15, So, 1NN(  X  3 ) =  X  R2 and 2NN( Equation (11), the probability that the type of  X  3 is  X  Zhuan Shu  X  can be derived as follows.
 Similarly, the probabilities that the type names of character Shu  X ,  X  Xing Shu  X , and  X  Cao Shu  X  can be computed accordingly, as shown in Figure 10(c). Algorithm 1 The DRL-based ( n-m ) FPDTs construction algorithm Algorithm 2 Data placement at master node For existing parallel database systems, the study of data placement is critically impor-systems, the M CN is a mobile, wireless, and heterogeneous environment in which users do not stay at a fixed place, which may raise several challenges to data placement in such a dynamic environment, as explained in the following. The optimal data place-ment scheme consists of two parts: 1) data placement in master nodes and 2) data placement in slave nodes , which is discussed in the following. 5.2.1. Data Placement in Master Nodes. For the data placement in the master nodes, all character images ( ) in the hub node are first grouped into k clusters based on their shape similarities by using the AP-cluster algorithm [Frey and Dueck 2007]. All the characters in each cluster are then sent to a master node which is randomly selected. Thus, one cluster corresponds to one master node. The centroid character image, the radius of each cluster and the master node ID number are recorded as a retrieval route table (RRT) at the hub node. Algorithm 2 summarizes the optimal data placement in the master node. 5.2.2. Data Placement in Slave Nodes. For the data placement in the slave nodes, we propose a partial data placement scheme in the slave nodes. The motivations are based on the following key observations.  X  Fast data access is very important for the parallel retrieval processing in the M  X  For users to access the data, they are distributed around the region (e.g., the whole  X  The retrieval efficiency can be significantly improved if the result characters can
Density-based Clustering of Users. As mentioned before, the efficiency of fast data access is very important to the location-based retrieval in the M this approach is to find an optimal data placement in the M the users X  positions.
 Definition 6 . A user is modeled by a triplet: where i denotes the user X  X  ID; Pos is the coordinate value of U &lt; x , y &gt; , where x and y refer to the two coordinate values, respectively; Tim refers to the time.

T HEOREM 1. Given m users in a cluster: U i = ( x i , y i centroid object C = ( x c , y c ) , the total distance m i 2 y
Let
In Figure 11(a), suppose that there are nine users who have retrieved and browsed the Chinese characters. We first perform the DBSCAN algorithm [Ester et al. 1996] to group the users into three clusters (the dash blue circle in Figure 11(b)) based on their spatial information. For the centroid ( C j ) of each cluster, according to Theorem 1, its optimal spatial position can be calculated by Equation (14). where | C j | means the total number of users in the j -th cluster.
 The cluster radius can be derived in Equation (15).

Adaptive Slave Node Merge Scheme. In the previous section, we assume that one cluster corresponds to a slave node. However, for each cluster, its number of users and the number of data accesses are different. For example, in Figure 11, although there are only one user (U8) in the third cluster, and six users (U1, U2, U3, U4, U5, U6) in the first cluster, the number of data accesses in the third cluster may be larger than the first one.

To economically deploy the slave nodes and maximize reuse of resources, we propose an Adaptive Slave Node Mergence (A SNM ) scheme in which four factors need to be considered.  X  Number of Users . The number of users in each N S is another factor to optimize the  X  Access Frequency . The access frequency of each N S is mined, and the nodes with  X  Spatial Location . Spatial information is very important for the node mergence, so
Definition 7 ( M INIMAL C OVER C IRCLE ) . Given two slave nodes N corresponding minimal cover circle ( M CC ) is a 2-D circle, formally denoted as M
CC ( N i S , N j S ) , which is subject to the following conditions:  X  X oth C S ( N i S ) and C S ( N j S ) are contained by the M  X  The area of the M CC ( N i S , N j S ) is minimal;
In Figure 12, suppose there are two cover circles of the N by two shadow circles, their corresponding M CC can be denoted by a dash circle. The illustrates an example of the spatial distribution of the five slave nodes, and Table V shows the distributions of the aforementioned three factors of the five N mergence. As an example, in Table V, for a slave node N 2 node is N 3 S . Assuming their access frequencies and the numbers of users are less than the threshold values, we can merge the two nodes into a new one N Table VI. Similarly, N 4 S and N 5 S can be also merged together.

T HEOREM 2. Given two slave nodes: N i S and N j S , and their corresponding cover ra-dius: R i and R j . The center ( N X NS ) and radius ( R x calculated by the following equations:  X   X   X

AsshowninFigure4,since R X = d ( N X NS , N i S + R i = d
As d ( N X NS , N i S ) + d ( N X NS , N j S ) d ( N i S , N then the value of R x is minimized. That is, the area value is minimal.
Therefore, the center position and radius of the new slave node sented as follows:  X   X   X 
N X NS . pos . x = N i S . pos . x + R j R
N X NS . pos . y = N i S . pos . y + R j R
Based on these two schemes (i.e., density-based clustering of users and adaptive slave node merge), the optimal placement of the slave node is detailed in Algorithm 3.
Once the optimal spatial placement of the slave nodes is provided by Algorithm 3, next we show how to effectively place the image data in the corresponding slave one. To address this problem, three main factors (i.e., retrieval character and its radius , affected clusters ,and access frequencies , etc.) need to be considered. As shown in Figure 14, assume that the n character images are grouped into three clusters (e.g., C ,C 2 ,andC 3 ). When a user submits a retrieval request (i.e., hub node, two clusters (e.g., C 2 and C 3 ) are intersected with the retrieval sphere based on the shape similarity at this node. For each user node, the basic idea is to put the character images in the affected clusters in the nearest slave node. Then, a Cluster Table ( CT ) at the hub node need to be updated, which is defined as a six-tuple: Algorithm 4 Update the cluster table where Cid is the affected cluster ID, Nid means the ID number of the user node where the retrieval request is submitted from, Sid is the ID number of the nearest slave node of the user one, CC refers to the cluster centroid character, CR is the cluster radius, AF means the access frequency.

Based on Algorithms 3 and 4, Algorithm 5 summarizes the optimal data placement of the slave nodes. As mentioned before, since the pixel resolutions of the digital cameras are high, the ordinary manuscript image is usually very high (e.g., 2040 the image is large accordingly. It is nontrivial to transfer an image with such a big size to the destination nodes, especially in a wireless network environment. So in this sec-tion, we propose an adaptive image data transmission scheme which includes Content-aware and Bandwidth-conscious Multi-resolution-based data Replica selection scheme (C
BMR ) and Priority-Based image block data robust Transmission scheme (PBT). is that for a same manuscript image, the image with different pixel resolutions can Algorithm 5 Optimal data placement of the slave nodes be transferred according to the variance of the network bandwidth. Specifically, with high network bandwidth, a high-resolution manuscript image can be transferred in a reasonable short period of time. On the contrary, in order to get a shorter response time, a lower-resolution version of the same image can be sent to the destination node with a lower network bandwidth.
 Different from conventional images, the background of the manuscript images in Figure 16, however, are usually relatively simple. As the main content of the images, the character images can be easily identified and segmented that are represented by rectangles. Reducing the pixel resolution of the manuscript image will probably lead to the bad experience of enjoyment of the beauty of the Chinese characters. Therefore, we need to maintain the resolution of some important areas in the image unchanged, which we called character area (CA). For the rest part of the image, they can be stored according to the multiple resolutions respectively. Based on the given analysis, the objective of our method is to get a tradeoff between the quality of manuscript images and the transferring time under different resolution and available network bandwidth.
Let us first denote the resolution of the i -th image as R and x UPP mean the lower bound and upper bound resolutions of the i -th image, re-spectively. Similarly, the bandwidth of the j -th edge is defined as E where y LOW and y UPP are the lower bound and upper bound bandwidth of the j -th edge, respectively. Based on an assumption that the image pixel resolution ( R proportional to the network bandwidth ( E j ), so the corresponding image resolution under the current network bandwidth can be derived as follows: where i  X  [1, ]and is the granularity (i.e., number of blocks).
 Similarly, as the current network bandwidth ( E j ) is among y be represented as follows:
As i is an integer, so i =
Therefore, under the condition of current bandwidth E j , the corresponding pixel res-olution of the i -th image can be derived as follows:
In Equation (21), a whole image is regarded as a object to be processed. The pixel resolution of the whole image can be adjusted according to the variance of the network bandwidth. This method, however, will lead to the pixel resolution of the CAs of the image be so low that the users can not clearly see them. Therefore, in the preprocessing step, as shown in Figure 17(a), the CAs in the image are firstly automatically identified by drawing the blue solid line rectangles. Figure 17(b) shows the result of processing. It can be seen that the resolutions of the CAs in Figures 17(a) and 17(b) are unchanged, and the resolution of the rest part in Figure 17(b), however, is decreased.
Let the area of image  X  i be S , the area of high-resolution parts be S tion be R i 1 , the area of the rest part be S 2 and the resolution be R then the comprehensive pixel resolution ( R i ) of image  X  It is worth mentioning that, to ensure the high pixel resolution of the CAs, namely, R is fixed in Equation (22).
 Replace Equation (21) with R i in Equation (22), we have Then R i 2 can be derived as follows:
For example, assume that the minimal and maximal pixel resolution of an image is: x ranges from 10 MB/S to 100 MB/S, namely, y LOW = 10 MB/S, y Additionally, S = 20 cm 2 , S 1 = 6cm 2 and the pixel resolution is R S
According to Equation (24), suppose the current bandwidth ( E optimal pixel resolution for image data transmission can be derived as follows:
R 2 = If = 10, then R 2 = [725, 725].
 If = 20, then R 2 = [594, 594].

Similarly, if the current bandwidth ( E j )is80MB/S,then if = 10, then R 2 = [1514, 1514]; if = 20, then R 2 = [594, 594]. ......

Based on the previous analysis, if is fixed, with the increase of network bandwidth, the optimal transmission pixel resolution is increasing accordingly. Meanwhile, if the bandwidth is fixed, with the increase of , the optimal transmission pixel resolution will decrease accordingly. 5.3.2. The PBT Scheme. Generally speaking, in the state-of-the-art image data trans-mission schemes, a whole image is transferred as an object. For the character manuscript images with high pixel resolutions, this transmission method, however, will lead to the increase of the failure in the transmission process. Once the transmis-sion failure is occurred, the image needs to be retransferred which results in a higher transmission cost. To overcome this technical bottleneck, we propose a Priority-Based Image Block Data Robust Transmission Scheme called PBT to support the successive transmission of the large image data.
 Definition 8 . Each block can be modeled by a four-tuple: where  X  bid refers to the block number;  X  pos refer to the coordinate position of the block in an image;  X  pri refers to the transmission priority of the block and pri  X  res refers to the corresponding pixel resolution of the block;
In this method, for example, assume that a Chinese character manuscript image in Figure 18 is first partitioned into 20 blocks based on a segmentation granularity. After that, a character area (i.e., part B ) with high-resolution in the image is then partitioned into 4 blocks. Finally, each block is granted with a different transmission where A is the rest part of the image except B and C , B is the important region set by user(represented by a red dash rectangle), C is a surrounding region of B (represented by a shadow part). The transmission priority of each block in each part is different, which is shown in Equation (27):
According the different priorities of the blocks, the image blocks are transferred in terms of the priority in a descending order, which not only ensure the robustness of data transmission but guarantee that the important information can be transferred with priority. Since the network bandwidth is limited and unstable in the wireless network environ-ment, it is vital to devise a dataset reduction algorithm to support the efficient data transmission. Additionally, as a character repository gets larger, it becomes less effi-cient to retrieve similar characters based on a probabilistic model by linear scan. It is nontrivial to index the large Chinese calligraphic character because: ( i ) the dimension-ality of each character may vary such that conventional multi-dimensional indexing schemes like R-tree [Guttman 1984] and VA-file [Weber et al. 1998] cannot be directly used; ( ii ) the introduction of the probabilistic model into the retrieval process incurs much higher CPU and I/O cost. To improve the probabilistic retrieval efficiency, we pro-pose in this section a novel probabilistic high-dimensional indexing technique, called the Multiple-Feature-Based Probabilistic Tree (M FP -Tree), to accelerate the dataset reduction processing in the D PRC processing. 5.4.1. Motivation and Preliminaries. The design of the M FP -Tree is motivated by the fol-lowing key observations. First, conventional Chinese character retrieval and indexing methods [Palmondon and Srihari 2000; Zhuang et al. 2011] are only based on the sim-ilarity of two characters without considering other factors such as styles, types, etc. So the efficiencies of these methods are unsatisfactory and their retrieval performance cannot be scaled well for a large dataset due to the C PU tion in the retrieval process. Second, feature uncertainty has not been considered in the state-of-the-art character retrieval techniques, the study of which may yield more accurate and objective retrieval results.

As a preliminary step, before constructing the M FP -Tree, all characters in are first grouped into T clusters by an AP-Cluster algorithm [Frey and Dueck 2007]. Each cluster is denoted as C j , in which the centroid character ( O selected by the algorithm, where j  X  [1, T ]. So, we can model a cluster as a tightly bounded sphere described by its centroid and radius , such a sphere is saved in a class information file.
 Definition 9 ( Cluster Radius ) . Given a cluster C j , the distance between the centroid O j and the character that has the longest geodesic distance to O cluster radius of C j , denoted as R j .

Given a cluster C j , the cluster sphere of it is denoted as centroid character of cluster C j ,and R j is the cluster radius.

Definition 10 ( Centroid Distance ) . Given a character  X  fined as the distance between  X  i and O j , and the centre of cluster that defined as: where j  X  [1, T ], i  X  [1, | C j | ], and | C j | is the number of characters in C
Once the T clusters are obtained, then the centroid distance of each character is com-puted. Moreover, its corresponding style , type and sentiment are identified at the same time. Finally, a uniform index key of a character can be obtained, which is inserted intoaB + -Tree.

For a given character, it is quite common to have a number of different styles, types, and even sentiments (see Figures 2 X 4). To embed these features into a unified in-dex key (to be discussed in Section 5.4.3), a corresponding encoding schemes of the style, type, and sentiment are needed. Tables VII X  X X show some examples of these schemes. 5.4.2. Feature Name-Value Encoding Table. To obtain a unified index key, we introduce a feature name-value encoding table called the F NVET in which the feature name and its corresponding values are encoded. First, a feature ID table is proposed:
For a character  X  i and its feature X , the corresponding encoding value can be defined by where  X  X denotes style or type or sentiment ;  X  F ID X is the ID value of feature X (cf. Table X) and F  X  F VID X is the feature value ID of feature X (cf. Tables VI X  X III) and F  X   X  is a stretch constant and is set to 10 empirically.

Note that, for each subjective feature (such as style , type ,and sentiment ), we assume that the number of its corresponding feature values is less than 10. Table XI shows an example F NVET , which is for the case when the number of features is one. For multiple features, a uniform encoding value ( E n ) can be derived as follows: where | F | denotes the number of the subjective features, and E value of the i -th feature.

Based on the encoding scheme mentioned earlier, an index key can be derived as follows: where E N is defined in Equation (30), P ROB N denotes the joint probability value, for-mally defined as P ROB N = i  X  [1, | F | ] P i .

For example, for a character  X  i , assume that the probability that its style belongs to  X  Yan Ti  X  is 75%, and according to the Tables V and VIII, the feature ID is 2 and feature ID value is 1, then the index key value can be calculated by: K 75% = 201.75. 5.4.3. Index Construction Algorithm. In order to effectively prune the search space, we derive a probabilistic multiple-feature indexing scheme, called M high-dimensional index for contour points is based on the iDistance [Jagadish et al. 2005]. As mentioned before, all characters are first grouped into T clusters using an AP-Cluster algorithm [Frey and Dueck 2007], then the centroid-distance of each char-acter is computed, and the style and type of each character can be either identified by users or derived by the D RL -based approach in the preprocessing step. Thus, a charac-ter  X  i can be re-modeled by a seven-tuple: where  X  i refers to the i -th character in ;  X  C ID is the ID number of the cluster  X  i belongs to;  X  C D is the centroid distance of  X  i ;
For each character  X  i in a cluster sphere, its index key can be defined as
Since the characters are grouped into T clusters, to get a uniform index key of image in different clusters, the index key in Equation (34) can be rewritten by Equation (33) as follows: where C ID is the ID number of cluster that  X  i falls in.

Note that since CD (  X  i ) may be larger than one, the value of CD ( malized into the range of [0,1] through division by a large constant M is guaranteed that the search range of each character X  X  centroid distance cannot be overlapped.

To facilitate character retrieval via submitting auxiliary information such as the style name, type name, or sentiment name of  X  i , its index keys can be derived by Equations (35 X 37), respectively:
Here, we suppose that the user submits two retrieval elements, for instance, StyID and  X  i ,or TyID and  X  i ,or SenID and  X  i . If the user submits three retrieval elements, for instance, TyID , StyID and  X  i ,or TyID , SenID and  X  an index key for  X  i can be rewritten as follows:
For four retrieval elements, StyID, TyID, SenID and  X  i submitted by a user, its index key can be represented as follows:
Note that Equations (35 X 41) representing the character index keys can be combined into a unified index key, as shown by Equation (42).

KEY ( X  i ) = Algorithm 6 MFP-Tree Index Construction
As shown in the bottom of Figure 19, the index keys in Equation (42) can be inserted intoaB + -Tree, resulting in what we call the M FP -Tree(II).

As mentioned, the basic structure of the M FP -Tree is a B each index key recording the values of CD, styID tyID, and SenID of a character. Algorithm 6 illustrates the detailed steps of constructing the M the routines tDis (  X  i )and TDis (  X  i ) are two distance transformation functions (ref. Equation (33) and Equation (41) respectively), and BInsert ( key , bt )isaB procedure. 5.4.4. Index-Support Probabilistic Range Retrieval Algorithm. For the Chinese calligraphic characters, probabilistic range retrieval (PRR) retrieves the similar characters that are closest in distance to a given retrieval character with a radius under the constrained of the probabilistic threshold(s). For example, a user may submit a retrieval character  X  q and a radius r , with the probability that the type of the candidate characters is Kai Shu being less than  X  T , and the probability that the style name of the candidate ones is Song Ti being larger than  X  S . For handling such complex retrieval conditions, the retrieval process as shown in Figure 20 is composed of two steps: (i) returning candidate characters by retrieving over the M FP -Tree(I) in which the range is [ left , right ], where left = C ID + ( CD (  X  q )-r )/ M AX , right M FP -Tree(II), with the ranges [ L EFT 1 , R IGHT 1 ]and[ L R IGHT 1 = 33 +  X  T ;and L EFT 2 = 25 +  X  S , R IGHT 2 = 26, respectively. After the three candidate character sets are obtained, the final result characters can be derived by the intersection processing of the three ones.

Algorithm 7 summarizes the whole P RR search process which is composed of three steps: 1) obtain the first candidate characters based on the shape-similarity (lines 2 X 9); 2) the second candidate set is obtained based on the subjective features involved in the P
RR (lines 10 X 21); 3) the previous two candidate sets are intersected to get a final one(lines 22 X 23). Functions Search () and mSearch () are the implementations of the range searches. BRSearch () is a B + -tree range search function. It is worth mentioning that if the probability criteria is  X  less than  X   X , then X Y = 1. Based on the four given enabling techniques, in this section, we present an efficient distributed probabilistic retrieval method for Chinese calligraphic character images in the mobile cloud environment. The D PRC is to retrieve the most similar characters that are closest in distance to a given retrieval character ( thresholds (  X  x ). Figure 21 and Algorithm 8 illustrate the D which is composed of three steps: (1) retrieval submission ,(2) retrieval routing ,and (3) index support parallel retrieval processing .  X  Retrieval submission . In the first step, user submits a retrieval request from the  X  Index support parallel retrieval processing . After the retrieval routing, the P Algorithm 7 PRR algorithm Algorithm 8 The DPRC Algorithm Input : retrieval character  X  q , radius r ,

S  X  S 1  X  S 2 11. return the answer character set S To verify the efficiency of the proposed D PRC method, in this section, we conduct simu-lation experiments to demonstrate the retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. The retrieval client end system is run on iPad platform and implemented by the Objective C language. The backend system is simulated by the Amazon EC2 [Amazon EC2 2009]. Each unit is a small instance of EC2 with 2.7 GHz Xeon processor, 2.0 GB memory and 1 TB hard disk. The units are connected via 1 Gbps network links. The number of nodes in our system varies from 10 to 100. The maximum data communica-tion rate is 150 Mbps in the wireless network.
 The Chinese Calligraphic characters image data we used are from the C [Cadal 2010]. The data size of the manuscripts ranges from 10 MB to 50 MB. The database contains a set of contour point features extracted from some 142,000 char-acter images in which each feature point is composed of a pair of coordinates y-axis &gt; . We have implemented the probabilistic retrieval approach and the M index in C ,inwhichaB + -tree uses a single dimensional index structure. The in-dex page size of B + -tree is set to 4096 bytes. To compare our proposed probabilistic retrieval approach with the MRF-based one, we have also implemented it. In our eval-uation, we use the number of page accesses and the total response time as the perfor-mance metric. We have implemented an online interactive retrieval system based on the iPad plat-form for Chinese calligraphic characters to testify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed retrieval method. Figure 22(a) shows an example Chinese calligraphic character retrieval in which a user submits a character  X  (nine) whose style is Yan Ti , with the retrieval radius and a threshold value set to 0.8, 60%, respectively. The candidate characters are quickly retrieved by the system with the aid of the M as shown in the left part of the figure is the retrieval result in which the similarity and confidence values of the answer character images are given against the retrieval one. As shown in Figure 22(b), to watch the manuscript where the character is from, the user can click the button that is drawn by a red ellipse. In the following experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval method by comparing with the shape-based method [Zhuang et al. 2005].

Denoting the set of ground-truth as rel , and the set of results returned by range search as ret , we adopt the widely used recall and precision as the performance metric, that is, 7.2.1. Probabilistic vs. MRF-based Retrieval. In the first experiment, we compare our probabilistic retrieval method with the Markov random field (MRF)-based method [Zeng et al. 2008] on the retrieval effectiveness. Figure 23 plots a Recall-Precision curve for the performance comparison of these two methods. It compares the average retrieval result (the precision rate under the recall rate) of 20 character retrievals ran-domly chosen from the database. Each of them has more than 4 different calligraphic styles and types. The figure shows that the retrieval performance of the probabilistic retrieval is better than that of the MRF-based method by a large margin, demonstrat-ing that the newly proposed probabilistic retrieval exploiting multifeatures is more accurate than the MRF-based one. This is because the probabilistic approach not only obtains the answer characters based on the shape similarity but also the characters with user desired type or style; while the MRF one can only support shape-similarity-based character recognition. 7.2.2. Effectiveness Comparison of Retrievals with Different Feature Combinations. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness of the retrieval method. For the four features, there are fifteen cases of the feature combinations which are shown in Table XII:
So we compare the average recall( AR ) ratio and the average precision ( AP ) ratio for the four retrieval cases, respectively. Based on Equation (43), the average recall and precision achieved by this retrieval method are defined in Equation (44): t = 20).

Figure 24 illustrates the effectiveness comparison of the fifteen retrieval cases. It is clear in this figure that the impacts of the different features and the feature combi-nations are different in the retrieval processing. In particular, for each feature case, the average retrieval results (the average precision rate under the average recall rate) for 20 times are obtained. The retrieval thresholds are randomly generated. From the figure, it is interesting to see that the AR and AP of the retrieval in which shape feature is involved are higher than that of without shape. For the subjective features such as however, are significantly lower. This is because the AR s are obtained by scanning all the characters based on the subjective feature(s), so most of the desired character im-ages can be identified. Meanwhile, as the number of the candidate characters is large, their corresponding AP s become very small accordingly. Moreover, for the sentiment in-volved retrievals, their corresponding AR and AP are slightly lower than that of other subjective features since compared with other subjective ones (e.g., type and style ), the modeling and identification of the sentiment s from the images are still hard and chal-lenging. For the feature combination cases of the more than two features among which the shape is, their retrieval effectiveness are slightly better than a shape-based sim-ilarity retrieval. The reason behind it is that adding other features such as type and style can further improve the retrieval effectiveness which is mainly dominated by the shape feature. Based on this analysis, the shape feature can still affect the retrieval effectiveness significantly. Combing other features can positively refine the retrieval results to some extent. 7.2.3. Effect of m. In this experiment, we evaluate the effect of m (the number of ref-erence characters) on the precision ratio. Figure 25 shows that with the increase of m , the precision ratio increases gradually. This is because the larger m is, the higher the accuracies of the F PDT s (cf. Section 5.1). When the percentage of the reference characters increases beyond 8%, the precision ratio is almost not increasing any more, showing that further references provide little additional value.
 This experiment studies the effect of the C BMR scheme on the performance of the D processing. Method 1 does not adopt the C BMR and method 2 uses it. Figure 26(a) shows when r is fixed and the bandwidth is relatively stable, the total response time using the method 2 is superior to that of method 1. Meanwhile, with the condition that the bandwidth is stable and r is increasing gradually, the performance gap becomes larger. This is because the data size of the candidate images to be transferred is increasing so rapidly that the images cannot be sent to the destination nodes quickly.
Moreover, Figure 26(b) shows that if is fixed, with the increase of the network bandwidth, the pixel resolution of the images to be transferred can be also increased. The reason is the same to the theoretical analysis in Section 5.3.1.

Figure 26(c) demonstrates that if the bandwidth is fixed, when is increasing, the optimal pixel resolution of image to be transferred is reduced. In this experiment, we first test the efficiency of the two transmission schemes: 1) Our proposed PBT method and 2) the progressive image transmission (PIT) [Chang et al. 2008]. In Figure 27, when the image data size is from 10 MB to 50 MB, the transmission time of the PBT method is gradually increasing and better than that of the PIT one. This is because compared with the mixed pixel resolution-based image reconstruction of the PBT scheme, the PIT adopts original resolution to reconstruct the images. The data size to be transferred by the PIT is larger than that of the PBT.
To evaluate the effect of data size on the transmission robustness, we then adopted five groups of image data in which the data size of each image are 10 MB, 20 MB, 30 MB, 40 MB, and 50 MB. The transmission robustness ( TR ) can be defined in Equation (45).

As shown in Figure 28, with the increase of data size, the successful data transmis-sion ratio ( STR ) is 100% by using the image blocking technique. For the data trans-mission without adopting this PBT method, when the transmission data size is less than 10 MB, the successful transmission ratio is 100%, however, if the data size is 20 MB, the average STR is decreased to 87%. And if the data size is larger than 40 MB, the average STR is zero since it is hard to transfer such a large image successfully. Based on the experimental result, to guarantee a high successful data transmission ratio, it is possible to transfer a large image only through the image blocking method in a limited network bandwidth.
 In the last experiment, we proceed to perform two experiments to study the effect of the data set reduction (see Algorithm 7) on the D PRC processing.

In the first experiment, we assume that the data size and the number of master (slave) nodes are fixed. As shown in Figure 29(a), when r increases from 0.2 to 1, the retrieval response time is also gradually increasing. This is because with the increase of r , the search region in the high-dimensional spaces becomes larger, which leads to the fact that the number of candidate character images is increasing accordingly. Still, the approach using data set reduction beats the one not using data set reduction under all the different r values.

In the second experiment, we assume that the radius and the number of master (slave) nodes are fixed. In Figure 29(b), when the data size increases from 20,000 to 140,000, the retrieval response time gradually increases. The method using the data The reason is the same as before. In this article, we have presented an efficient probabilistic and interactive multiple-feature-based indexing and retrieval framework for large-scale historical Chinese calligraphic character image repository in mobile cloud environment. To support bet-ter appreciate the Chinese calligraphy work conveniently, based on our previous work on the probabilistic retrieval of historical Chinese calligraphic character manuscripts repositories, we propose four enabling techniques (1) D RL gation, (2) optimal data placement scheme, (3) adaptive data robust transmission algorithm, and (4) index support data reduction scheme. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to testify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed D prototype retrieval system is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of our new approach to Chinese calligraphic character retrieval, to-gether with some extensive experiments.
