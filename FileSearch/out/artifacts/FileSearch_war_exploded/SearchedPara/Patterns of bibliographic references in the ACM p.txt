 1. Citation analysis in Computer Science
A scientific document, which we will call a source , makes references to other scientific documents (which we will call des-tion, references are listed at the end of the paper, in a references or bibliography section. If a source document A makes a reference to a destination document B, we will say that B was cited (by A). Thus, in this paper we will use cited to refer to destinations. Scientific documents may be published in different venues  X  such as journals, conferences proceedings, tech-nical reports, books and book chapters, which we call document types .

Citation analysis is the study of the references mainly from the destination X  X  point of view. The intuition is that important results are cited many times, and thus the count of how many times a paper, an author, or a journal have been cited is a proxy for its  X  X  X mportance. X  Citation analysis has been used more commonly as a tool to evaluate journals ( Garfield, 1972 ), universities, departments, and researchers ( Moed, 2005; Ren and Taylor, 2007 ). On the other hand, CS research is not well represented by the standard research evaluation metrics; Parnas (2007) and Meyer et al. (2009) , among others, have pointed out that CS research has a high respect for conference publications, which are not included in most citation count metrics and thus, places the field in disadvantage when compared with other Sciences.

CS researchers agree that conferences are important; some CS subareas attribute more prestige to having papers accepted to particular conferences than to journals. Many arguments have been put forth for the importance of conferences as a pub-lication venue for CS, including the speed of publications of results and the dynamic character of CS research areas which may not fit well with the standard view of a journal with a well defined, fixed scope of interest.

One of the goals of this research is to evaluate how important are conference papers as references of CS papers. Do CS papers, in general, make references to conference papers? Are references to conference papers the majority of the references in CS papers? Are conference papers among the most cited destinations of CS papers? The answers to these questions provide us with some evidence of the importance of conference papers in Computer Science research. 1.1. ACM Digital Library author, publication date, publisher, and when available, abstract, references (made by the document), and citings (references made by other document in the Guide to this destination). The information pages are publicly available. According to ACM, the Guide includes over 1.2 million information pages for documents published by over 3000 publishers.
 information pages contains a link to the full text of the documents, only available to subscribers. 1.2. This paper (2006) source set . The source set includes conference papers, journal papers, and articles published in the ACM magazines and newsletters. We believe that this source set can be seen as a (unfortunately biased) sample of the whole CS literature, and thus, this research attempts to measure some characteristics of the bibliographic references in the CS literature as a whole. of the ages of the cited documents in the source data set. These statistics may be of interest when comparing the CS reference patterns with that of other scientific areas, but we do not pursue these comparisons in this paper.
 program that classifies the destination of a bibliographic reference as a conference paper, a journal paper, a book (or book chapter), or other document types. The program uses approximate pattern matching associated with a large base of journal and conference names, plus a set of heuristics. The program was applied to all the references in the source set, and we deter-mined the proportions of different types of destinations.
 evaluation was used not only to evaluate the accuracy of the automatic classifier, but also to understand the importance of a broader set of document types such as technical reports, white papers, software manuals, specifications, Web pages, and pat-ents, in the CS literature.
 source set. We selected all destinations that were cited 10 or more times, and compared the proportion of conference papers, journal papers, and books.
 fundamental concepts in CS, whereas others may be papers that introduced short term  X  X  X ot X  topics. To evaluate these two groups, we also determined the set of most cited documents for all ACM papers published in 2003. We believe that the highly cited destinations that are common to both 2003 and 2006 represent fundamental papers in CS, whereas destinations in only in the CS scientific process, as a venue to quickly publish worthy ideas, would indicate that conference papers should be more frequent in the latter group, and books and journal papers should be more frequent in the fundamental publication groups. We were be able to evaluate this claim. 1.3. Related literature
Gl X nzel et al. (2006) and Lisee et al. (2008). Gl X nzel et al. (2006) justified the study of proceedings publications based on the importance of conferences to Engineering and Applied Sciences, which includes CS. The analysis of the Web of Science (WoS) proceedings database, from 1994 to 2002, showed that almost half of the total number of publications indexed by WoS in the area of Engineering are proceedings.
 how many of those references were to papers published in proceedings. Overall, only 1.7% of the Natural Sciences and
Engineering references were to proceedings, and 2.5% for the Social Sciences and Humanities, and these proportions were decreasing in time. But within Natural Sciences and Engineering, Computer Science papers had on average 19.8% of their references to proceedings. CS is the subfield with the highest of such proportion, followed by Electrical Engineering and the source was published and year the document cited in the reference was published. For the whole set of destinations, the median age (or half-life) is 4.0 years for proceedings references, and 6.1 for all references. For Engineering (which in-cludes CS), the average age of all references was 10.9 years, but the average age cited proceedings papers was only 7.1 years. Thus, the age data corroborates the idea that conference papers are more representative of forefront scientific results, which will obsolesce faster.
The most complete reference analysis of the CS literature was reported in Goodrum et al. (2001). They compared ref-erences from journals indexed by WoS with sources available in the CiteSeer repository of CS literature. The comparison is interesting because the WoS sources and the CiteSeer sources are in some way at extremes of the spectrum of CS litera-ture: WoS indexes almost exclusively journals, where as CiteSeer, at that time, indexed only freely available documents, mainly technical reports and other documents made public by their authors. Of interest to this research is the comparative analysis of the destination types of the most cited documents available in CiteSeer and the ones indexed by WoS, dis-played in Table 1 . Unfortunately, from a methodological point of view, the data in Table 1 cannot be generalized to the whole CS literature because it was collected from the most cited sources, and thus cannot be seen as  X  X  X eneral cases. X  But it is the only published data on the proportion of references to books, journals, and conference proceedings to compare to our results. 2. Method 2.1. Data collection
The set of source documents used in the analysis were all information pages in the ACM DL, for papers published in 2006 and in 2003. As mentioned above, most of the analysis was performed in 2006 data set, and the 2003 data was used only for comparisons regarding the most cited papers.

In September of 2007, when we collected the data, the URL to the ACM paper information pages in the portal had a single identity number. A typical URL would be http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=301974 . Unfortunately, by the ID only there was no way of deciding if the paper belonged to the ACM DL, and thus, if it was published in one of the ACM sponsored con-ferences and journals, or whether it belonged to the ACM Guide.

We sequentially generated and requested all pages with id numbers from 858404 to 1248459 (we did not find any paper from 2006 with id lower than 858404 and higher than 1248459). In each page, there is a string  X  X  X ear of Publication: X  and we used that information as the publication year. We selected only the information pages that contained a link to a full text, which indicated that the document was published by ACM. 2.2. Manual analysis
We randomly selected 665 references from all the documents in the 2006 source set. Two of us with more experi-ence, JW and RA, independently classified the random references into: (a) books (reference to whole books), (b) book chapter , (c) conference paper (including workshops), (d) journal papers , (e) magazine papers (non-peer reviewed articles in magazines such as ACM newsletters, and ComputerWorld), (f) standards (including RFCs), (g) manuals (manuals for software or devices), (h) news (newspapers or news services news), (i) patents , (j) thesis (no distinction between master or PhD thesis), (k) reports (technical reports from universities, white papers from other research organizations and con-sortia), (l) data sets (URL address of data sets), (m) software (URL address of software), (n) course materials , (o) Web address (to companies and consortia such as OMG and W3C, but not pointing to a report, standard, manual, or other of the classes before), and (p) others (all other types of references). When there was conflicting opinions regarding the classification, the case was discussed, and in some cases we retrieved the document, in order to agree on its classification. 2.3. Most cited destinations
As we mentioned, the ACM paper information page (both for the DL and The Guide) has a section on the references of the paper. ACM uses some algorithm of entity resolution to discover which destination corresponds to each reference, and if the destination is one of the documents in the Guide, ACM will create a link from the reference to the destination X  X  information page. In this research we relied on the ACM entity resolution algorithm and we assumed that ACM would include in the Guide the information pages for the most common destinations. Thus, we only counted how many times each URL for the destinations appeared in the source set.
 2.4. Confidence intervals types in the manual evaluation and in the automatic evaluation.
 the different document types are the standard sample intervals for very large populations (the set of all references in the source set). Assuming a 95% confidence level, the formula for the confidence intervals is: where p is the proportion of a particular document type in the sample, and n the sample size, in this case 665.
The manual classification is able to evaluate the accuracy of the automatic classification and one can use the error rate to calculate the confidence interval of the proportions.
 procedure for that type. The probability distribution for the number of errors is a binomial distribution which can be approx-imated by a normal distribution with mean Ne t and with standard deviation p tered. Thus the 95% interval of confidence for proportion p t is 3. Results book reviews, magazine articles, and so on. The 2003 source set contained 6,557 documents. There were 200,018 references in the 2006 source set.
 are 308 documents with more than 100 references. The average number of references per document is 21.26 (median 18). This can be compared with some data on references per articles for other scientific areas. Biglu (2007) reports that the average number of references per document for all papers indexed by Thomson Reuters Science Citation Index (SCI) for 2005 was 34.63. Vieira and Gomes (2010) also uses SCI data for 2004, and reports on average 18.25 and 24.11 reference per article for Mathematics and Physics respectively. The relatively low figures of references per article for Computer Science may have some consequences on impact factors of CS publications venues ( Biglu, 2007 ).

We performed a separate analysis of the distribution of the ages of the references for journal and conference source doc-uments. The results are in Table 2 . The first three columns show the number of references to journals, conferences, and oth-ers document types, for journal and conference source documents (the two lines). The last two columns show the mean age of the references. The data show that CS researchers have different reference practices for journal and conference papers. The proportion of references in journal papers are 32% to journals and 38% to conferences; whereas in a conference paper, only value &lt; 2.2e 16).

The mean age of the references are also different for journal and conference publications. References made by journal pa-prefer more references to journal papers. 3.1. Document types The main results regarding both the manual and automatic classifications of the references are displayed in Table 3 .
The first column identifies the document type, ordered by decreasing of frequency. The next three columns show the re-sults for the manual analysis, the following three to the automatic analysis: the first figure is the number of document types found, the second the proportion to the total, and the third, the 95% confidence interval as discussed in Section 2.4 .
Notice that the classification of books for the automatic analysis includes references to book chapters, which is treated separately in the manual analysis. The same is true for conference papers, which in the automatic analysis includes magazine ing book chapters), conference, and journal papers, whereas Others for the manual analysis refer to any reference type that is not among one of the 15 types discussed in Section 2.2 .

Regarding the manual classification, the document types of papers in magazines, manual, news, thesis, data sets, patents, and course materials, each correspond to 1% or less of the references. These document types were not included in the table, and thus the sum of references in Table 3 does not add to the 665 references that were analyzed.

To build the confusion matrix for the automatic classifier we grouped book and book chapters into books, and journal and magazine papers into journal, and all other classifications as  X  X  X ther X . Table 4 displays the confusion matrix.
The error rate for the automatic detection of conference papers is the number of incorrectly classified references (as a the error rate for book classification is 0.0466, for journal classification is 0.0541, and for others, 0.1083. 3.2. Most cited documents We manually classified all 580 destinations (in the Guide) that received 10 or more references in the 2006 source set. Table 5 displays the proportion of books (or book chapters), journal, and conference papers of the 10 top most cited docu-ments (actually 11, since both the 10th and the 11th most cited had the same number of references), the top 20 (actually 21), top 50, top 100 (actually 103), top 200 (actually 213), and top 500 (actually 580). Among the 580 most cited destinations there is one technical report and 4 RFC.

But, as we discussed in the introduction, Table 5 may include two different components: papers that are in some way  X  X  X undamental X  to CS, and papers that present  X  X  X ot topics X  in 2006. In an attempt to separate these two components, we com-puted among these 580 references, which ones were also present among the most cited documents in 2003, and the ones that were not. Only 145 of the 580 most cited destinations were also among the 2003 most cited references. Table 6 presents the proportions of document types of the most cited destinations common for 2006 and 2003. They likely represent the pa-pers that presented a  X  X  X undamental X  result in CS. Table 7 presents the proportions for the documents that were only present in 2006 as a most cited. We believe that they are an approximation of papers that presented topics that became important in 2006, and thus we call them  X  X  X ot topic X  papers. The first two columns are blank because there was no hot topic papers among the top 10 and top 20 most cited references.
 4. Discussion and conclusions
As expected, conferences are important to Computer Science, and that is represented in the number of references to con-ferences in the 2006 source set. They represent 39% of all bibliographic references in 2006, but somewhat more surprising, they represent 50% of the 500 most cited destinations. And if we consider only the subset of  X  X  X undamental results X  within the 500 most cited (as described in Section 2.3 ), conferences still amount to almost 40% of such documents. That is, conferences are venues where final, finished results are also published. The importance of conferences was severely underestimated by the analysis using the WoS data and even the data using the CiteSeer documents performed by Goodrum et al. (2001) . But, as we discussed, the numbers obtained by Goodrum et al. (2001) cannot be generalized to the whole CS literature, even for the years the data refer to, since they represent a non-random sample.

Journals are also important as CS references: 27% of all references are to journals, and they correspond to 25% of the 2006 most cited destinations.

A somewhat untold story is the importance of books in the CS literature. Although the numbers were available in Goodrum proportion among the most cited destinations types. A possible explanation to the importance of books, especially textbooks one wants to provide a reference to the result that the vertex cover problem is NP-complete or a reference to the Floyd X  X ar-shall algorithm, one adds a bibliographic reference to a complexity textbook (the second most cited destination in the 2006 source set) or an algorithms textbook (the third most cited destination) instead of the respective original papers. The 2006 most cited destination, the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides seems to point to a different pattern. A complex concept was  X  X  X irst X  widely presented as a whole book, instead of as conference or journal papers, 2 which follows the style of publications in the social sciences.
The importance of books and in particular textbooks as bibliographic references in the CS literature has parallels in other scientific areas. Some researchers have pointed out that review papers (papers that summarize different empirical research) are more cited than others, and, in particular, they are more cited than the primary research they summarize ( Peters and van Raan, 1994; Aksnes, 2006 ). Clearly, textbooks are the  X  X  X eview papers X  of Computer Science.

Another interesting conclusion of this research is that computer scientists behave somewhat different when writing con-ference or journal papers in terms of reference choices. Journal papers make more reference to other journal papers and such references point deeper into the past, than conference papers. Some differences in the proportion of journal and conference papers for the most cited WoS and CiteSeer documents is also reported in Goodrum et al. (2001) (see Table 1 ), but the mag-nitude of changes we encountered are higher.

Regarding the age of references, we can only compare our data with the one presented in Glanzel and Schoepflin (1999) , who collected the mean age of references for papers published in 1994 indexed in SCI. According to Glanzel and Schoepflin (1999) , Mathematics and Electronic Engineering had mean reference age of 11.3 and 8.6 years respectively. That should be compared with 7.8 which is the mean age for references in journal papers. Unfortunately, it is yet unclear if the younger tween the data collected.

The analysis of the most cited documents, specially the comparison to 2003, seems to indicate that CS research X  X  waves of interests last for a short time. Only 25% of the documents that were cited 10 times or more in 2006 also appeared among the reflected in the mean life of references: on average papers refer to documents from 5 to 6 year old, but in 3 years 3/4 of the most cited papers changed.

Books are the most frequent document types among the documents that remain important between 2003 and 2006, fol-lowed, surprisingly, by conference papers. Among the representatives of the new wave of interest, conferences, as expected, play the most important role.

The manual analysis of the random sample of the references also reveals another interesting phenomena. Beyond confer-ence and journal papers, and books, the next most cited document types are: reports, other Web addresses, standards, book chapters, software, and manuals.

We were somewhat surprised with the low number of references to PhD thesis. This maybe due to the fact that PhD can-didates are encouraged/required to publish partial results of their work and thus, references to thesis may have migrated to the corresponding conference and journal papers. We were also surprised with the relatively high number of references to newspaper or news service news  X  this seems to indicate that some CS research is either inspired by or try to argue its rel-evance based on current events.
