 Social media including micro blogging service such as Twitter has received great attention recently in order to capture real-time events. This joint research project between us and NSW Transport Management Centre (TMC) 1 aims to leverage social media as an additional channel for transport monitoring and incident management, with the ultimate goal of having more comprehensive views on traffic situations.
 Processing Twitter feeds is very challenging. With over 280 million monthly active users and 500 million tweets sent per day, 2 there is a large volume of tweets from all over the world that satisfy a given query. However, very few tweets are from NSW, Australia and many of them contains words such as  X  X rash X  or  X  X ccident X  but they are actually non-relevant to traffic tweets. been developed to assess its usefulness in assisting traffic and incident manage-ment on a day-to-day basis as well as during special events. The detected events or incidents were classified by advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms before visualised on an online map and presented to TMC operators in real time. We also introduce the annotation schema and computational model for extracting the traffic related entities within the tweets (e.g. street, incident type, vehicle, lanes, directions...). These entities are essential for automatic construction of the official TMC logs as well as supporting the classification and significant evalua-tion of the incidents.
 of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in social media analysis specifically for traffic incident detection. We will show that the use of CRFs boosts up the performances of several popular classification algorithms. The CRFs model also generalises the content of the tweets into named entity features and then com-bines them with regular keyword-based features. There is great research interest in event and incident detection from social media within the last few years. For detecting large scale incidents using Twitter, vari-ous ML approaches have been proposed [ 7 , 12 ]. For small scale incident detection, Twitcident is a mashup for filtering, searching, and analyzing social media infor-mation about small scale incidents [ 1 ]. Li et al. (2012) introduce a system for searching and visualization of tweets related to small scale incidents, based on keyword, spatial, and temporal filtering [ 9 ].
 itoring and reporting. He et al. (2013) examined whether social media could improve the long-term (beyond 1 h) traffic prediction by analysing the correla-tion between traffic volume and tweets counts with various granularities [ 5 ]. In some other research, traffic information was extracted from Twitter using syn-tactic analysis with simple keywords matching and rule-based method [ 6 , 14 ]. In [ 14 ], tweets were classified into two categories: point (e.g. car crash) and link (e.g. traffic jam) with accuracies of 76.85 % and 93.23 % respectively. Twitter is also employed by the TMC in some cities (Sydney, Jakarta) to spread the news of traf-fic. NLP techniques were used by [ 3 ] to get the data of traffic from Jakarta TMC official account, so that the traffic information can be presented in map view as a mobile application. While most systems analysed social media content by simple rule-based and string matching methods, the only research that employed ML algorithms combining text classification and semantic enrichment of microblogs was presented in [ 13 ]. They introduced a system for real-time detection of small scale incidents with an accuracy of 89 %. In their study, the open source NLP tools (Google Spellchecking, Stanford CoreNLP [ 10 ]) and ML library (Weka [ 4 ]) were utilised to build the incident classifier and decision maker. However, none of these previous studies were able to provide comprehensive analyses of the tweets in terms of detecting incident related information to improve the classification process as demonstrated in our study. Figure 1 illustrates our system architecture for crawling and processing public Twitter posts. The architecture is considered as two different phases: machine learning (ML) training process and real-time incident detection.
 3.1 Filters To estimate the location distribution, 10,000 tweets were initially crawled using a keyword-based query. By default, Twitter APIs return tweets that satisfied the query from all over the world while the NSW TMC is only interested in traffic incidents within NSW which is less than 1 % of total tweets. A query in Twit-ter API is allowed to specify the geo-tagged tweets within certain parameters. However, only 3 % of tweets contain geo-tags as the users do not usually want others to see their current locations. Our country filter is based on the combi-nation of the following fields ordered by their verification priority: geo-location, time zone, location and country from user X  X  profile. This filter can remove most oversea posts and return over 90 % relevant tweets from Australia given most users set the correct time zones and have their profile locations filled. 3.2 NLP Components The NLP cutting edge techniques are employed to pre-processing the crawled tweets. First, very frequent words like stop words and special characters are removed as they are not valuable as features for ML algorithms. To prepare for the feature generation step, the words are normalised to their root forms using the Stanford lemmatizer. 3 Furthermore, the Stanford POS tagger identify the word form such as noun, verb, adjective... Finally, the advanced pat-tern recognizer based on regular expressions and finite state automata is utilised to capture the date, time and incident X  X  location (e.g. street name, suburb) [ 11 ]. incident from the text due to lack of detailed address (e.g. house number). The common useful description of incident location contains two roads, main road and secondary road at the nearest intersection along with suburb. One example of standard tweet from TMC account is  X  X YD traffic ACCIDENT 3 vehicles -CASULA Hume Hwy at De Meyrick Ave X  which contains suburb (CASULA), main road (Hume Highway) and secondary road (De Meyrick Avenue). Traf-ficWatch X  X  pattern recogniser is trainable and flexible on text structure by sim-ply adding new training examples. It is capable of identifying all popular road address representations in Australia such as Street, St, Road, Avenue, Highway... 3.3 Machine Learning Processes Incident Related Tweet Classification. The public APIs provided by Twit-ter is limited by keyword search. Because of this, there are many tweets that contain words such as  X  X ccident X ,  X  X rash X ,  X  X elay X  or  X  X raffic X  but they are not related to any recent traffic incidents. Example of non-relevant tweet is  X  X ear loud airplane sound. Fully expects it to crash into a building X . Importantly, the TMC would like to capture as many traffic incidents as possible but at the same time they do not want to spend much effort looking at many non-relevant tweets. Based on this requirement, the classifier performance was targeted to reach a reasonably balanced precision and recall.
 tion process. Finally, the following features were extracted to train incident related tweets classifier:  X  Bag of words: the weight score of each word feature within a tweet is calculated by an accumulated tf-idf score over all positive tweets.  X  Lemma, part-of-speech and chunk features: the Stanford Twitter tagger is specifically tuned for English tweets and outputs the lemma, part-of-speech tags and chunk tags [ 2 ].  X  Pattern recogniser: this feature distinguishes the plain words with non-word tokens such as date, time, number and special characters.  X  Bag of tags: this feature indicates the traffic related entities tagged by the computational annotation model (presented in next section). Entity is the generalisation of the frequent key words used to report incidents.
 The experiments were executed using Weka [ 4 ]. Several ML algorithms which cover major types of classifiers have been investigated including:  X  Instance based: k Nearest Neighbour (kNN).  X  Generative: Bayesian Network (BN).  X  Discriminative: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and decision tree (C4.5). Traffic Incidents Entities Annotation. During the process of obtaining the incident information, TMC operators usually ask for many details (e.g. incident type, vehicles involved, lanes blocked, direction) to put in the record. Table 1 shows example of major fields in TMC incident logs. To automatically populate structural logs; this project involves the annotation of tweets to identify the components needed to complete an incident report. In this process, free-text tweets are annotated for examples of the information to be extracted and then algorithms are developed that use the examples to compute a more general model of the desired content. The model is evaluated and the algorithm revised in a feedback process to produce a more accurate result. This is continued over a series of experiments until an optimal model is identified.
 The annotation model is trained based on CRFs which is an advanced method for sequential labelling [ 8 ]. The same first three feature sets from classification model was applied to train the CRFs entities tagger.
 Instead of using a general NER to identify traffic entities in the text as in [ 13 ], we have designed a special tag set which is more relevant to the incident information extraction task. This tag set is better controlled and does not contain redundant information which can add noise to mislead the classification process. An online collaborative environment based on Brat annotation tool up to support rapid labelling of the tweets. Figure 2 illustrates the annotation schema and example annotated tweets.
 Besides the tags that describe non-relevant and duplicated tweets, the anno-tation schema is divided into four main groups:  X  Location tags include State, Suburb, Street, Point of Interests (e.g. Harbour
Bridge, Opera House, Darling Harbour...), place (school, church, park...).  X  Entity tags include the objects involved in the accident such as people (man, children), vehicles (car, truck) and stationary objects (e.g. tree, traffic light).  X  Incident type tags include the main categories of the incidents (e.g. queue, accident, breakdown, police activities, road work...).  X  Incident properties tags includes the general descriptions about the incident on the road, they are lanes (e.g. 2 lanes closed or affected), directions (e.g. north bound, both ways), time and current status (clear or delayed). ing system. For example, the incident with type of  X  X ccident X , involved  X  X ulti-vehicle X , several  X  X eople X  and blocked  X  X oth ways X  on  X  X otorway X  should be ranked higher than just a normal  X  X elay X  on one  X  X irection X  of a small road. The ranking criteria based on the detected entities are fully configurable as the TMC may have different interest over time or special events. The important tweets will be highlighted and presented to the operator to process as a priority.
 train the classification model. Because the same incident details can be described by different key words (e.g. high way/hwy, break down/stall/stationary), gen-eralising them into categories and entities will help the model to learn these variations more efficiently.
 normal key words, which will allow rapid retrieval of the incidents that satisfied certain criteria. For instance, the system supports the query  X  X etrieve all the break-down incidents that caused delays on single direction of the freeway X . Furthermore, the automatic annotation models are extendable to analyse and index the official TMC X  X  logs based on the same schema to serve the same management purpose. Online Clustering Algorithm. With the volume of rich data returned from Twitter, our system aims to extract more useful information for users by aggre-gating tweets into meaningful clusters. This effectively gives users a summary of the popular incident types in the tweets as they emerge over time. Figure 3 is an example of a cluster identified on 13 Jan 2015 where the user can easily interpret the time of first tweets and the growing pattern of the cluster. We have implemented an online algorithm to incrementally cluster the tweets from live stream data using cosine similarity and Hamming distance evaluation. This algorithm is designed to gradually improve its centroids when more data is available. Besides the predefined incident types, the unsupervised clustering algorithm provides a more general view of the tweet clusters on the common key words used.
 The key difference between our proposed method and previous online clus-tering algorithms is the cluster time frame threshold. Because similar incidents could be seen on different days, this parameter is used to remove old and out-dated clusters to avoid redundant and non-relevant information. Depending on specific applications, it can be configured to span over several hours (e.g. traffic incidents) or several days (e.g. special events). 4.1 Data Set The data set comprises of 5000 filtered tweets (mostly from NSW, Australia) crawled using Twitter REST API in September, 2014. These tweets were then labelled by TMC as relevant/non-relevant and used to train the ML models. 10-fold cross-validation was applied to evaluate models X  performance based on averaged Precision, Recall and F1-score.
 4.2 Named-Entity Recognition Table 2 shows the performance of the computational annotation model with over-all F1-score of 96 %. The State and Suburb entities were excluded because they can be identified by string matching from a pre-defined list. From this table, the most popular reported incident type is  X  X ccident X  followed by  X  X reakdown X  and  X  X ueue X . All of these high frequency incident types were extracted with both Precision and Recall of approximately 95 % or higher. In addition, the model correctly identified most of the street information from the text which is crucial for geo-locating the incidents on the map.
 tags were extremely rare with high variety level (e.g. hazard, place and special events), and thus it was difficult to learn when these tags were relevant. 4.3 Classification The incident related entities recognised from the computational model were then become the important features for the classifier. Table 3 illustrates the classi-fication performance using 4 different algorithms. The baseline features with bag of words archived the best F-score performance of more than 90 % using BN. Adding POS tagger and pattern recogniser features slightly improved the performance by approximately 1 %. With the support of Bag of tags features, the performances of all four algorithms further increased significantly by 2 % to 3 %. Finally, the best F1-score of 95.4 % was recorded from BN method with precision of 94.2 % and recall of 96.6 %. 4.4 Incident Detection for Special Event TrafficWatch has monitored traffic conditions during the International Fleet Review (IFR) special event in Sydney, Australia for the time period from 6:00 am October 3 to 10:44 am October 10, 2013. In total, 45753 IFR-related tweet messages were extracted, 1056 of which were traffic related.
 With regard to locating incidents, 2.87 % (1222 tweets) were originally associ-ated with device geo-locations, while TrafficWatch further identified 19 % (8065 tweets) with geo-locations by using text analysis. Hence in total about 21 % of the entire tweets had been visualised by TrafficWatch on maps.
 Detecting Incidents Earlier than TMC Log Time Case study 1 : a heavy traffic condition at around military road in Mosman (Fig. 4 ). TrafficWatch detected this heavy traffic condition about 3 h earlier than the time this incident was logged in TMC.
 Case study 2 : a tweet-based incident saying an over-height truck blocked access to the Harbour Tunnel at North Sydney, suggesting all traffic to use the Harbour Bridge (Fig. 5 ). TrafficWatch detected this tunnel blockage about 3 h and 47 min earlier than the time this incident was logged in TMC.
 Discovering Incidents that are not Reported to TMC Case study 3 and 4 : The tweet in the left table of Fig. 6 shows a queue of 7 kms at Brooks road, possibly caused by a truck accident. The tweet in right table is about a car accident on the corner of Elizabeth and George Street. Both incidents cannot be found in TMC logs.
 Identifying Twitter Users that Are of Great Interest to NSW Traffic. Based on the analysed tweets, TrafficWatch has identified a list of Twitter accounts/users that have great interest in NSW traffic. TrafficWatch has ranked these accounts by their frequency of twittering activity, i.e., the accounts that are ranked higher are the ones who post more traffic-related tweets. From this list, the top ranked accounts in NSW are Snarltraffic, 2DayFM, Cbemergency. To provide TMC with a real-time overview of the traffic picture in NSW, the TrafficWatch interface was developed based on Cesium Bing map which is a geospatial visualisation software for running inside web browsers without plugins. are loaded onto the live map within a few seconds from time of posting. Figure 7 illustrates the TrafficWatch snapshot for NSW around 16:43 19 Nov 2014. When the user clicks on any tweet, a pop-up window will be opened to show its content, e.g.  X  X on X  X  go in the Sydney Harbour tunnel if you X  X e heading south. Car crash blocking both lanes X . Furthermore, the timeline feature of Subspace enables review of any past incidents and events. This function is very useful to learn the tweet patterns from the historical data including first mention about the incident, the total number of re-tweets, similar and related tweets. The TrafficWatch research project carried out detailed analysis and visualisa-tions of the Twitter stream to monitor the daily traffic of the NSW state of Australia. It is capable of providing useful information to TMC in a real-time manner which helps TMC to be informed about issues and incidents that could potentially affect operations of public transport services, and be able to make better management decision with respect to the operations of the transport and event planning.
 Besides the capacity of detecting the road incidents sooner or incidents not reported to TMC, TrafficWatch also suggests frequent traffic Twitter accounts that can be of good value to the TMC, since they are very active in releasing traffic information that can help to understand the traffic conditions. In this study, we also introduced the general annotation schema and high accuracy computational model for detecting traffic related entities. This NER model is applicable to detect similar incident information from other social media sources as well as from official TMC X  X  incident logs. Furthermore, the novel employment of CRFs to support the classification of Twitter feeds demonstrated significantly higher results in all investigated ML algorithms.
