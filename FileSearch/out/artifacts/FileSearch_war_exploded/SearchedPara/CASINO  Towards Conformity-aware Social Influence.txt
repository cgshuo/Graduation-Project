 Social influence analysis in online social networks is the study of people X  X  influence by analyzing the social interactions between in-dividuals. There have been increasing research efforts to under-stand the influence propagation phenomenon due to its importance to information dissemination among others. Despite the progress achieved by state-of-the-art social influence analysis techniques, a key limitation of these techniques is that they only utilize positive interactions ( e.g., agreement, trust) between individuals, ignoring two equally important factors, namely, negative relationships ( e.g., distrust, disagreement) between individuals and conformity of peo-ple, which refers to a person X  X  inclination to be influenced. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm CASINO ( C onformity-A ware S ocial IN fluence c O mputation) to study the interplay be-tween influence and conformity of each individual. Given a so-cial network, CASINO first extracts a set of topic-based subgraphs where each subgraph depicts the social interactions associated with a specific topic. Then it optionally labels the edges (relationships) between individuals with positive or negative signs. Finally, it computes the influence and conformity indices of each individual in each signed topic-based subgraph. Our empirical study with several real-world social networks demonstrates superior effective-ness and accuracy of CASINO compared to state-of-the-art meth-ods. Furthermore, we revealed several interesting characteristics of  X  X nfluentials X  and  X  X onformers X  in these networks.

Though the field of social network analysis ( SNA ) has developed over many years, it is with the recent emergence of large-scale on-line social networking applications that techniques from this area have received a great deal of attention. We are now faced with the opportunity to analyze social network data at unprecedented lev-els of scale and temporal resolution. In this paper, we present our work towards addressing one of the challenges, namely the social influence analysis problem.

The goal of social influence analysis is to study individuals X  in-fluence by analyzing the social interactions. By identifying the  X  X nfluentials X  in a social network, users may be able to maximize the influence of a piece of information [6]. Informally, influentials are those individuals whose opinions or advices are often accepted and supported by others. For instance, Kempe et al. [6] proposed a greedy algorithm which aimed to find a limited number of influen-tials from whom the information diffusion can be maximized.
Recently, social networks are viewed as signed networks [7], where social interactions involve both positive and negative rela-tionships. Consider the signed network in Figure 1 depicting inter-actions between a set of individuals. An edge pointing from u to v denotes that person u trust/agree ( resp., distrust/disagree) person v . An edge representing trust relationship is labeled as positive ( e.g.,  X  X  X  uv ), otherwise negative ( e.g., in the opposite direction of the edges ( i.e., v influenced u and w ).
A closer analysis of social influence phenomenon in signed net-works reveals that there are three important factors. Firstly, an in-dividual X  X  ability to influence others ( e.g., v ). Secondly, the nature of social interactions (positive/negative) between individuals ( e.g.,  X  X  X  uv , clination to be influenced by others [2]. Note that an individual X  X  ability to influence or conform is context-sensitive . For example, in Figure 1 u conforms to v  X  X  opinion on iPad 2 . However, it does not necessarily mean that u will always conform to v on any topic. For instance, u may not agree with v on conversation related to salsa dancing as u may believe that she is a better dancer than v .
Despite the benefits of the state-of-the-art social influence anal-ysis techniques, a key limitation is their inability to systematically exploit the aforementioned second and third factors for superior analysis. Consider the two signed networks in Figure 2 where an edge distrust) v . The shadowed part depicts the conformity of individuals u and u 2 . Specifically, u 1 is easily convinced by others whereas u is not. Thus, it is easier for v 1 to influence u 1 than v u . However, state-of-the-art approaches have ignored this issue and failed to differentiate between these two cases. Thus, they may compute the same influence score for v 1 and v 2 . However, an indi-vidual X  X  influence should be increased if a larger number of users conform to her (positive interactions) but decreased if she is dis-trusted by many individuals (negative interactions).
 We propose a novel algorithm called CASINO ( C onformity-A ware S ocial IN fluence c O mputation) that somewhat departs from exist-ing influence analysis techniques in the following way: CASINO focuses on integrating the interplay of influence and conformity of individuals for social influence analysis by exploiting the posi-tive and negative signs of edges. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the interplay of influentials and conformers with the goal of social influence analysis. Additionally, context-aware , allowing the same individual to exhibit different in-fluence and conformity over different topics of social interactions. Given a social network, if it is a context-aware one, then first extracts a set of topic-based subgraphs . Each subgraph de-picts the social interactions between individuals associated with a specific topic. Since the edges of a social network may not be al-ways explicitly labeled with positive or negative signs, CASINO ploits an existing sentiment analysis technique to label the edges in each topic-based subgraph. Finally, given a set of signed topic-based subgraphs, the algorithm iteratively computes the influence and conformity indices of each individual in each subgraph. By applying CASINO to real-world online social media sites ( Slash-dot ( slashdot.org ), Epinions ( www.epinions.com ), and Twit-ter ), we strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CASINO compared to state-of-the-art approaches and at the same time reveal several interesting characteristics of influentials and conformers in these sites.
Leskovec et al. [7] used logistic regression to predict the signs of edges in signed networks by exploiting 7-dimensional degree fea-tures and 16-dimensional triad features. Cai et al. [3] proposed another feature ( i.e., influence) aside from the 7-dimensional de-gree features in [7]. A PageRank-like algorithm was developed to compute the influence of individual users and then use it as another feature in an SVM classifier to predict the signs of edges. In con-trast, we not only study the influence of u on the sign of edge also investigate the conformity of v and its effect on u  X  X  influence. Moreover, we also enable the same individual to exhibit different influence and conformity in different topics.

The notion of conformity originated in social psychology and is defined as yielding to perceived group pressure by copying the be-havior and beliefs of others [2]. We are inspired by the conformity study in social psychology and utilize it to enhance social influ-ence analysis in online social networks. We take into account the conformity in social influence and propose a model to evaluate the conformity in a social group.
In this section, we formally introduce the notion of influence and conformity in the context of signed social networks.

Social interactions in online social networks can be either posi-tive ( i.e., friendship) or negative ( i.e., distrust and opposition). For instance in Epinions , people can give both positive and negative ratings to other users. In online discussion sites such as Slashdot , users can tag other users as  X  X riends X  (positive) and  X  X oes X  (nega-tive). In Twitter , the retweet can be a positive or a negative one. In the following discussion, we treat such social interaction as signed directed graph.

In a signed social network G ( V , E ) , each edge has a positive or negative sign depending on whether it expresses a positive or neg-ative attitude from the generator of the edge to the recipient [7]. A positive sign indicates that the recipient supports the opinion of the generator whereas the negative sign represents otherwise. For example, Figure 2(b) depicts a signed social network. The positive edge E + = { ones ( E  X  = { tionships. Note that the signs on the edges are not always available explicitly. In networks such as Epinions and Slashdot , the sign of each edge is explicitly provided. However, in other networks such as blogosphere and Twitter the sign of each edge is not explicitly available. In this case, we need to preprocess the network using text mining methods to discover signs associated with the links (de-tailed in Section 4). Consequently, a social network G ( V taining both positive and negative edges can be represented using a pair of graphs G + ( V , E + ) and G  X  ( V , E  X  ) denoting the induced graph of positive edges E + (trust/agreement) and negative edges E  X  (distrust/disagreement), respectively.

In our approach, each individual (vertex) in a signed network is associated with a pair of influence index and conformity index to describe the power of influence and conformity. Reconsider the signed network in Figure 2(b). Intuitively, the influence of v should increase as aggregated conformity of those who trust v u ) increases. On the other hand, the influence of v 2 should de-crease if the aggregated conformity of those who distrust v w 20 ) increases. Thus, the influence index of an individual should capture this interplay of influence and conformity and penalize her whenever necessary.
 D EFINITION 1. [Influence Index] Let G + ( V , E + ) and G  X  ( V , E  X  ) be the induced graphs of the signed social network G ( V , E ) . The influence index of vertex v  X  V, denoted as is defined as follows.
 where  X  ( u ) represents the conformity index of vertex u
Similarly, the conformity index of u 2 in Figure 2(b) depends on the influences of vertices which are trusted or distrusted by u itively, as the aggregated influence of those vertices which u ( e.g., v 2 ) increases, u 2 is more inclined to conform to others. On the other hand, when the aggregated influence of vertices which u to others. This intuition is captured by conformity index which is defined as follows. Algorithm 1 :The CASINO algorithm.
 D EFINITION 2. [Conformity Index] Let G + ( V , E + ) and G  X  ( V , E  X  ) be the induced graphs of the signed social network G ( V , E ) . The conformity index of vertex u  X  V, denoted as defined as follows.
 where  X  ( v ) is the influence index of vertex v  X  V.

Thus, according to the above definition the influence index of v in Figure 2(b) can be computed as  X  ( v 2 )=  X  ( u 2 )  X   X  ( conformity index of u 2 is computed as  X  ( u 2 )=  X  ( v 2  X  ( w 22 )  X   X  ( w 23 ) . Observe that the aforementioned definitions of influence and conformity are mutually dependent on each other. Consequently, a recursive computation framework is necessary to compute these two indices.
In this section, we formally describe the algorithm CASINO computing conformity and influence indices of individuals in a so-cial network containing positive and negative edges. Online social networks can be classified into context-aware and context-free net-works. The former represent networks where the edges are associ-ated with topics (context) as social interactions may often involve conversations on specific topics. For example, each conversation in Twitter is based on a specific topic. On the other hand, interactions in context-free networks do not involve specific topics. For exam-ple, in Epinions and Slashdot individuals trust (distrust) each other regardless of any specific topic. The leftmost social network in Fig-ure 3 is an example of context-aware social network where an edge labeled as A 1 , A 2 indicates that the pair of individuals communicate with each other on topics A 1 and A 2 .

The CASINO algorithm is outlined in Algorithm 1 and consists of three phases, namely the topic-based subgraph extraction phase (Line 3), the edge labeling phase (Line 8), and the indices compu-tation phase (Line 9).

Figure 3 depicts an overview of CASINO algorithm. Given a so-cial network G ( V , E ) , if it is context-aware then the topic-based subgraph extraction phase extracts a set of subgraphs G where each subgraph G A ( V A , E A )  X  G contains all the vertices and edges in G associated with a specific topic A . Each subgraph G sents positive or negative attitudes of individuals toward opinions of others in G with respect to the topic A . For instance, in Fig-ure 3, this phase generates three topic-based subgraphs, namely, G 1 , G A 2 ,and G A 3 , for topics A 1 , A 2 ,and A 3 , respectively. Recall that edges of a social network may not be explicitly labeled with positive or negative signs. This is especially true for context-aware Algorithm 2 :The edgeLabel procedure.
 networks ( e.g., Twitter ). On the other hand, links in many context-free networks ( e.g., Slashdot and Epinions ) are explicitly labeled with signs. Hence, it is important to label the edges in each topic-based subgraph G A . The objective of the edge labeling phase is to assign sign to each edge by analyzing the sentiment expressed by the edge. Figure 3 depicts the labeling of G A 1 . Finally, given a set of signed topic-based subgraphs G , the goal of the indices compu-tation phase is to iteratively compute the influence and conformity indices of each individual in each G A  X  G . Observe that a vertex v in G may have multiple pairs of indices if v is involved in more than one topic-based subgraph. Since the first phase is straightforward, we now elaborate on the remaining two phases in turn.

The edge labeling phase. The edge labeling method varies with dataset. In this paper, we adopt the method described in Algo-rithm 2. For each edge text topic A )in G A , we identify 5-level sentiment ( i.e., like, some-what like, neutral, somewhat dislike, dislike) expressed at both ends using LingPipe [1] which is a popular sentiment mining package adopted in several recent research [4] (Lines 4-5). If the sen-timents at both ends are similar ( sentiment similarity threshold is less than  X  ), we denote the edge as positive (Lines 6-7). Otherwise, we denote it as negative (Lines 8-9).

Indices computation phase. Given a topic A and topic-based subgraph G A , the preceding phase generates G + A and G  X  loss of generality, assume that there are  X  G  X  different topics. Then, we are able to compute an individual X  X  influence and conformity indices for each topic ( i.e.,  X  A ( u ) and  X  A ( u ) ). Algorithm 3 out-lines the strategy for computing a pair of influence and conformity ence index and conformity index of all vertices to be 1 (Lines 1-4). Subsequently, in each iteration it computes them for each vertex by using the values of the indices in previous iteration (Lines 6-8) and normalizing these values using the square root of the summation of all vertices X  index values (Lines 9-13). The algorithm terminates when both indices converge. In [8], we have proved that CASINO is guaranteed to converge after a fixed number of iterations n .Ob-serve that the technique can easily be extended to compute the ag-gregated indices of an individual by taking into account the entire social network G over all topics A = 1 ,...,  X  G  X  . In this case, E E  X  in Definitions 1 and 2 are replaced by  X   X  G  X  respectively.
In this section, we present the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of CASINO and report some of the results obtained. A more detailed results is available in [8]. To this end, we borrow Algorithm 3 :The indicesCompute procedure.
 the experimental framework articulated by Leskovec et al. [7], in which machine-learning based approach is used for discovering the presence of unknown edges and edge sign prediction by exploiting various edge features. By considering conformity and influence indices as new features for classification, it is expected that these additional features will provide more concrete evidence for edge prediction compared to state -of-the-art strategies.

We consider the following context-free and context-aware net-works where each link is explicitly or implicitly labeled as posi-tive or negative. (a) Context-free network data: In order to com-pare the performance of CASINO with state-of-the-art efforts on in-fluence evaluation in signed networks [3, 7], we adopt the same datasets that have been used in these work: Slashdot and Epin-ions 1 (Table 1). Recall that these netw ork data are context-free and contain explicit signs of edges to indicate the attitudes of individ-http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ uals towards one another. (b) Context-aware network data: We use the Twitter dataset to investigate the performance on a context-aware network. The dataset was crawled using the Twitter API during Dec 2010 to Feb 2011 (Table 1). We extracted top 20 trends keywords at hourly duration and retrieved up to 1500 tweets for each trend. Then we identified the relationships between all the tweets in the dataset. The reader may refer to [8] for details re-lated to statistics of the dataset and construction of context-aware interaction graphs from it.
We have implemented CASINO in Java and run all the experi-ments on a 1.86GHz Intel 6300 machine with 4 GB RAM with Win-dows XP. The algorithm converges after average 30 iterations. We set the sentiment similarity threshold  X  (Algorithm 2) to 1.
Similar to [3,7], in our experiments, the task of edge sign predic-tion is considered as a binary classification problem. We adopted SVM light classifier [5] and classification accuracy is taken as the main measure for evaluation. The reason for adopting accuracy as evaluation measure over precision and recall is that the former is suitable for quantifying the prediction performances of both posi-tive and negative samples. This is crucial in our framework as in most experiments both positive and negative edges are being pre-dicted. In order to avoid biased classification, we adopt the same strategy used in [3, 7]. Specifically, we create a balanced dataset with same number of positive and negative edges for training and testing. Based on the learned model (discussed below), we predict a label 1 or -1 for each target edge indicating its possibility to be positive or negative, respectively.

In order to compare the prediction accuracy of the proposed ap-proach with state-of-the-art efforts, a baseline classifier is constructed by referring to the structural features discussed in [7]. Specifi-cally, given an edge from vertex u to v , a 7-dimensional feature vector { d + in ( v ) , d  X  in ( v ) , d + out ( u ) , d  X  is constructed, where features d + in ( v ) and d  X  in ( v ber of positive and negative incoming edges to v , features d and d  X  out ( u ) represent the number of positive and negative outgo-http://dev.twitter.com/doc Table 2: Features involved in different approaches. (P: positive, N: negative, I: influence, C: conformity, A: topic) ing edges from u , features d in ( v ) and d out ( u ) denote the number of in-degree and out-degree of v and u ,and C ( u , v ) denotes the total number of common neighbors of u and v without considering the edge direction. Then, we create variants of this baseline classifier by adding influence index and conformity index as new features. Table 2 describes the features involved in the feature vector for each edge
Positive edge presence prediction. We first conduct a series of experiments to predict the presence of positive edges. In order to test the effect of negative edges in predicting the presence of pos-itive edges, we adopted a regression function of SVM light presence of positive edges are labeled as 1 and negative edges are labeled as  X  1. Figure 4 shows the average accuracy for the bench-mark datasets, where the results are compared between different classifiers for different size of training and testing data. We can make the following observations. First, for each dataset PN forms better than P indicating that information related to negative edges enhance the qua lity of edge presence prediction. Second, the prediction accuracy is further improved when we incorporate the influence index or conformity index as a feature ( ICP Note that ICP performs slightly better than IPN but the improvement is not significant. When the training set is large both approaches exhibit similar performance. Third, ICPN consistently reports the best prediction performance. That is, edge presence prediction is enhanced when we consider the interplay between influentials and conformers.

Signed edge prediction. Next, we undertake a series of experi-ments to predict the signs of edges. Our goal is to predict the signs of edges which maybe either positive or negative. Figure 5 reports the prediction accuracies of the classifiers. Observe that among the three approaches involving both positive and negative edges ( IPN ,and ICPN ), ICPN performs the best, followed by IPN and respectively. Thus, by taking into account the influence and confor-(a) Positive edge presence mity of vertices, the accuracy of sign prediction task can improve significantly.

Edge presence and signed edge prediction in context-aware networks. We now report the performance of our model on a context-aware network ( Twitter ). In this experiment we adopt the classifier ICAPN which takes into account the topic information as-sociated with each edge. Figure 6 plots the prediction accura-cies of the relevant classifiers. Observe that in both figures outperforms the rest. Note that the performances of ICAPN ICPN are similar when the training set is very small. This is be-cause there may not be enough training edges in each topic-based subgraphs G A when the training set is very small. Consequently, not enough information is available to accurately compute and  X  A ( u ) . All these evidences demonstrate that by leveraging on the influence and conformity indices in topic-based subgraphs, the proposed model leads to superior prediction performance for both positive edge presence and edge sign prediction tasks.

Influentials and conformers. We analyze the list of influen-tials and conformers detected by the CASINO algorithm. Figure 7 depicts the distribution heatmaps of influence index versus confor-mity index for each benchmark dataset. For each individual u in a network we compute  X  ( u ) and  X  ( u ) and represent it as a point in the influence-conformity 2-D plane. Then we separate the plane into grids of size 0 . 005  X  0 . 005 and count the number of points in each grid. The color shade of a grid denotes the number of points residing in it. Note that both influence index and conformity index are normalized into the range of [ 0 , 1 ) . For each figure, we explic-itly draw a bounda ry line along which the ver tices exhibit identical influence index and conformity index. Observe that the line sepa-rates the influence-conformity plane into two areas. In the sequel, we refer to the top area as  X  Area I  X  and the down one as  X  Area II  X . The points belonging to  X  Area I  X  exhibit higher influence index compared to conformity index, indicating that individuals in this area are more prone to influence others than being influenced. We refer to them as influence-biased . On the other hand,  X  Area II  X  X ep-resent individuals who are more prone to be influenced than influ-encing others. We refer to these individuals as conformity-biased .
We first analyze the context-free networks (Figures 7(a)(b)). Con-sider Figure 7(a) related to Epinions dataset. Observe that 31% of all individuals belong to  X  Area I  X . Consequently, fewer number of individuals in this network are influence-biased. That is, majority of individuals in Epinions are often conforming to the others. Sim-ilar phenomenon also exists in the Slashdot dataset. Observe that those vertices in Epinions which exhibit very high conformity index values also have high influence index values. On the other hand, vertices with highest influence index values have a wider range of conformity indices ( i.e., from 0 to 0 . 11). Such phenomenon indi-cates that in Epinions most influence-biased individuals may also conform to others whereas the most conformity-biased individu-als are always influencing others. Interestingly, the phenomenon is different in Slashdot dataset (Figure 7(b)). Specifically, individuals who are associated with highest influence index values have very (c) Twitter (Top-1) small conformity index ( i.e., less than 0 . 02). But individuals with highest conformity index may not exhibit small influence index val-ues. In fact, the conformity index values of these conformity-biased individuals are distributed along the boundary line (  X  ( Thus, we can make the following observations regarding Slashdot . Firstly, there are a few influence-biased individuals who exhibit very high influence but are not easily influenced by others. Sec-ondly, there do not exist conformity-biased individuals who are not influencing others at all.
 Next, we analyze the context-aware network (Figures 7(c)(d)). Figures 7(c) show the distributions of influence and conformity in-dices for the top-1 topic ( Mumford &amp; Sons ) with the most num-ber of tweets (4390). Observe that 40% of all the individuals fall in  X  Area I  X  for Figure 7(c). Notably, it exhibits certain influence-biased characteristics similar to Slashdot . Thatis,thereareafew influence-biased individuals who exhibit very high influence but are not easily influenced by others. This similarity may be due to the fact that both Slashdot and Twitter aredrivenbyuserconver-sations where majority individuals are commenting or following a few individuals who started the conversations. Figure 7(d) plots the distribution of indices computed over all topics. In this case, 41% of all individuals belong to  X  Area I  X .

Table 3 shows IDs of top-10 authors who exhibit the highest in-fluence index and conformity index for top-1, top-2 and all topics. Consider the top two twitters for all topics. The author  X 142987924 X  who has the highest influence index receives 66 conforming edges out of 73 in-links over 22 topics. On the other hand, the author  X 51389816 X  who exhibits the highest conformity index initiates 35 conforming edges out of 37 out-links over 37 topics indicating that she has high chance to conform to others X  opinions in almost all the topics she is involved in. We can make the following ob-servations. Firstly, none of the t op-10 authors occ upies a position in both indices. Secondly, the top-10 individuals having highest influence and conformity indices are different for different topics. This confirms our hypothesis that social influence phenomenon is context-sensitive as same individual may exhibit different influence and conformity over different topics of social interactions.
The social influence analysis for online social networks is an im-portant problem with applications to viral marketing and informa-tion dissemination among others. State-of-the-art social influence analysis techniques ignore two equally important factors, namely, negative relationships and conformity of people. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for social influence analysis called CASINO , which quantifies the influence and conformity of each in-dividual in a network by utilizing the positive and negative rela-tionships between individuals. Our exhaustive experimental study using several online social media sites demonstrates the effective-ness and superior accuracy of CASINO compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our investigation revealed that the knowl-edge of conformity of individuals enhance the accuracy of social influence analysis. We also observed several interesting charac-teristics of influentials and conformers in Slashdot , Epinions ,and Twitter .
