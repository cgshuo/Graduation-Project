The emergence of what is called the social web and the continuing stream of new applications and community-based platforms including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and others had a substantial impact on recommender systems research and practice over the last years in different ways.
First, today X  X  web users are more willing to share more about themselves than before the Web 2.0, thus providing more information sources that can be leveraged in the user modeling and recommendation process. Furthermore, the newly available information sources can not only be used to optimize the recommendations for an individual user, but can also help to identify more general patterns and trends in the behavior of the community that can be exploited by other applications.

Second, personalization, information filtering and recom-mendation are often the central functionality of many of these social web based applications. On typical social net-works, users for example get recommendations for news to read, songs to listen to, groups to join, friends to follow, people to connect or jobs that might be interesting.
These developments lead to different challenges to be ad-dressed in recommender systems research. On the one hand, for example, the question arises of how to effectively com-bine the huge variety of information sources for improved recommendations. On the other hand, regarding the new op-portunities for applying recommender systems in social web environments, in many cases new techniques are required to address the particularities of the domain or to deal with scalability issues.

The ACM RecSys 2013 Workshop on Recommender Sys-tems and the Social Web aims to be a platform for re-searchers from academia and industry as well as for prac-titioners to present and discuss the various challenges and possible solutions related to all aspects of social web rec-ommendations. The call for papers correspondingly covered a variety of topics in this area including all sorts of appli-cations of recommender systems technology and their in-terfaces; collective knowledge creation and topic emergence; context-aware and group recommendation approaches; and case studies and empirical evaluations.

This year X  X  workshop is already the fifth in a series of successful workshops co-located with the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems since 2009. Overall, we received 17 submissions from authors of 13 different countries, which demonstrates the continuing interest of the community in this field.

The submitted papers were thoroughly reviewed and se-lected for presentation at the workshop by a program com-mittee of international experts in the field. The papers ad-dressed a number of different topics and contained proposals for a number of new approaches to build better social web recommender systems. In the context of the novel applica-tions areas for recommenders on social web platforms, the papers for example dealt with the recommendation of mes-sages (posts), events, locations, tags as well as general infor-mation items based on social web information. Beside these already X  X raditional X  X ypes of social web recommender appli-cations, some of the papers also introduced very novel areas in which social web information can be leveraged for recom-mendations such as for investment decisions or the problem of group formation. Other papers finally focused on ap-proaches to further improve the quality of recommendations based on social network information, the social graph as well as sensor information.
