 Successful technology becomes invisible. Few people think much about internal combustion engines while they drive to work in three-thousand-pound hunks of metal powered by them, or electricity while it enables countless parts of their modern lives. Data mining has a long way to go before it succeeds in this way --or does it? At KDD-98, the Behind-the-Scenes Data Mining panel presented five views on this aspect of the success of data mining. George H. John, Data Mining Guru at E.piphany, moderated the panel which included Usama Fayyad, Senior Researcher at Microsoft; Elliot Fishman, Director of Product Management at DoubleClick; Gerald Fahner, Project Analyst at Fair Isaac &amp; Co.; and Paul DuBose, CTO of Analytika. The story below is a fictional amalgam of their presentations, seen from the viewpoint of an average citizen --a day in the life of John Q. Record.
 Data Mining, Applications, KDD-98 Panel Discussion Report, Embedded data mining applications. John wakes up at 6:30 to the sound of his clock radio blaring. He got it a couple of months ago at the local Wal-Mart. There were several boxes of this model on the shelf, because the store X  X  sales &amp; inventory forecasting models predicted relatively high weekly sales for this model. and hopes to get back the hair from his twenties in a few years. He reads the morning paper. The print quality is good, and there aren X  X  any major smears. John has a pleasant drive to work. John gets to work and turns on his computer. It X  X  Thursday, and on Thursdays he likes to see how sales are activity and is pleased that his region is pulling in a higher profit than his peers. However, when he clicks another button to ask for the main differences between his group and other groups, he X  X  disappointed. He discovers that his people aren X  X  doing a good job in selling two products that have low margins but are considered strategic to the company. He clicks another button to ask, among those customers to whom his group has pitched the strategic products, what factors influence whether a customer bought. It turns out there are four different types of customers and asks his sales staff to focus them for now, and arranges phone calls with the other regional directors to find out more about their sales strategies for other types of customers. His mother X  X  birthday is coming up, and she X  X  an avid reader, so John logs in to Amazon.com to find something. She mentioned that she really liked the investment book by Peter Lynch she X  X  of other books commonly bought by the same people who bought the Lynch book. He looks through the reviews, picks a couple, and has them sent. He remembers he also wants to send his nephew a gift, and gets a recommendation from the toy store X  X  web site in the same way. Over his lunch hour, he checks on the status of his mortgage application. The loan officer tells him that because of his great credit score of 710, he X  X  eligible for a low rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage. On the way back to work, he stops at a fast food restaurant intending to get a soda, but notices that a lunchtime special value-meal combination is priced only a little higher than the drink alone, and includes a hamburger. He goes for the combo. During a break in the afternoon, he checks his stock prices on StockMaster.com, and is shown an ad for a mortgage broker service on the web. He clicks through and fills out a form to investigate competing mortgage rates. At 10:31am, 2:03pm, and 4:17pm, John got three different spam e-mails. At 4:17pm, 4:18pm, 4:19pm, and 4:19pm again he got time. But John never saw any of them. John and his fian cee meet and spend the evening buying some furniture and home electronics items for the new place. He stops company, and they say they just want to be sure it X  X  him using his card. They get home and watch Seinfeld, then stay tuned to NBC through the next show and then ER. Looking through the day X  X  mail before falling asleep, John tosses two credit card applications in the trash. He sleeps peacefully at night, because he saw on the evening news that the city police department had just caught a prolific criminal who frequented his neighborhood.
