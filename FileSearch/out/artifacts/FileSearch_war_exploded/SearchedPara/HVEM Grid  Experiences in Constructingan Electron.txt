 Many areas of science currently use comput ing resources as part of their research, and will soon have the ability to utilize more powerful computing resources across a new infrastructure called the  X  X rid. X  S cientists will then have access to very large data sets and be able to perform real-time experiments on this data. This  X  X ew X  science, which is performed throug h distributed global collaborations en-abled by the Internet, using very large dat a collections, teras cale computing re-sources, and high-performan ce visualizations is called e-Science[4]. So, scientists in e-Science need storage for large files, computing resources, high-performance visualization, and automated workflows. These require high-performance com-puting resources, large storage systems, security, workflow management, and remote job execution/ management. These issues are the same issues that have either been solved or will be solved in the Grid[1].

High Voltage Electron Microscopy (HVEM) [3] lets scientists see objects at a magnification greater than the actual specimen. The type of HVEM referred in this paper is transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which produces an image that is a projection of the entire object, including the surface and the internal information. When tilt is needed, the goniometer rotates to change the angle of the sample. It is the CCD camera that produces an actual image inside the HVEM. HVEM users control the HVEM in a fine-grain manner, observe the specimen using the above subcomponents of HVEM, and manipulate high-resolution images using computing/storage resources. Since remote users want to perform the same tasks as offline users, the HVEM-Grid provides remote users with applications for controlling the HVEM, observing the specimen, and carrying out other tasks remotely.

The objective of this project is to work towards an implementation of the vision of being able to use the HVEM of the Korea Basic Science Institue (KBSI) remotely. This typically means that the remote users can carry out the realistically-large scale research.

In this paper we propose and describe the HVEM-Grid system, which has the capabilities listed above. To use the HVEM of KBSI, users should reserve and visit the labortory in the KBSI. With the help of operators, users can perform the experiment. After the experiment, users can take the results such as images and video streaming files, and manipulate the result with helpful programs.
 This process has two main challenges. One is for users from far to use the HVEM at night with minimal support of operators. The other is to use the previous experimental results. These show functionalities that our system should have. Our system should have the ability to perform the experiment on the internet remotely, to manipulate the result, to store the experimental results, to search the previous experiment, and to show the permitted user the results. This section describes the architectur e of the HVEM grid. Figure 1(a) shows that our system has a 3-tier architecture which enables easy integration with legacy sys-tems using gateways encapsulated by ser vices or objects. Therefore, the HVEM-Grid is an integrated system of HVEM -legacy applications for accessing or con-trolling the HVEM -and computing/storage resources for the HVEM users.
Grid and Web Service which is based on the XML messaging have many advantages suitable for integration with complex systems : platform independent architecture, interoperability, and flexibility.

Adopting the 3-tier architecture, Gr id, and Web Service, complex and com-pound systems are easily integrated. This is the reason why our HVEM Grid has the above architecture. 3.1 Client Tier The client tier is responsible for the representation of data, handling user events, and controlling the user interface. The client tier in HVEM grid is based on the grid web portal. Users can login via the web portal. Then, they can start the Control/Streaming/Workflow client application downloaded from the web, control the HVEM, observe the sample inside the HVEM, and execute a workflow task that describes batch jobs, such as constructing 3-D images from 2-D images and copying image files to another location. The tasks that the HVEM users can perform using above applications are followed:  X  Requesting the general operations of the goniometer, TEM, and CCD camera  X  Viewing the real-time video from the CCD camera  X  Accessing or manipulating the 2-D or 3-D images  X  Generating the workflow specification and requesting the workflow to be  X  Searching the images or video files, papers, and experiments in the databases
Figure 1(b) demonstrates our client GUI, which can be launched from our web portal, to interact with the remotely located HVEM. 3.2 Application Server Tier The application server tier is responsible for the logics and functionalities needed by the client tier. It also protects from the direct access by the c lient applications. In this system, application logic is based on the grid services using Globus Toolkit 4.x[2]. This tier is mainly composed of three services: HVEM Control Service, Streaming Service, and Workflow &amp; Dat a management service. These services have not only the primitive functions provided by the data server tier but also compound functions which combine primitive functions such as transactions.  X  HVEM control service provides control of TEM, goniometer, and CCD cam- X  Streaming service provides real -time streaming from CCD camera.  X  Workflow &amp; Data management service a ccepts the workflow request, executes 3.3 Data Server Tier The data server tier is responsible for data storage and data access. Besides the widespread storage serv er, existing legacy systems are often reused here. In the HVEM grid, this tier is composed of st orage servers, computational nodes, streaming servers, storage managers, a job scheduler, a cluster manager, and HVEM. The HVEM Controller encapsulates the existing HVEM control appli-cation through the web service, and thus the primitive functions can be called in the form of SOAP messages. Comput ational nodes can be accessed via job schedulers such as PBS and LSF, and storage servers can be accessed via storage managers such as SRB. In this paper we explained HVEM-Grid, which provides capabilities needed by remote HVEM users. The primary goals of this system are to enable large-scale research for individual scientists and to help form various research communities through this proposed infrastructure. To do so, remote users should be able to control the HVEM, see t he screen from cameras i nside the HVEM, access the large images, and create/execute various types of workflow. We believe our system can satisfy the capabilities listed above.

Currently, components related to HVEM control, such as the Control Applica-tion in the presentation tier, the HVEM control service in the application server tier, and the HVEM controller in the data server tier, have been developed. Also, metadata design for data management, workflow description language for workflow service, and other components have been designed. In the near future, we will develop and deploy the complete system and allow scientists to use our system. Also, our system will be further improved and optimized.
