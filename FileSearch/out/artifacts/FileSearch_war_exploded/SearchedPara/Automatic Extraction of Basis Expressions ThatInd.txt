 It is important for companies, governments and investors to predict the economic trends in order to forecast revenue, sale s of products, prices of commodities and stock prices. The diffusion index 1 is one of indices concerning economic trends, and is computed every three months, and provides economic trends during prior period. However, it is difficult to foreca st the business performance accurately by using diffusion indices, as it can not indicate current economic trends.
These indices are computed using numeric data. However, some qualitative language data that reflect economic trends may not be quantified straightfor-wardly. For example, an opinion  X  Economy seems to recover  X  in a newspaper article is hard to be quantified, as  X  Economy seems to recover  X  is a sense of the writer.

Nakajima et al.[1] proposed a method for extracting articl es concerning eco-nomic trends from newspaper articles and classifying them into positive articles that indicate upbeat in economy and negative ones that indicate downturn in economy. However, Nakajima X  X  method can not classify articles having two dif-ferent opinions. For example, an articl e that indicates economy in Aichi prefec-ture is upbeat while that in Gifu prefecture is downturn, includes two different opinions about different areas, and can not be treated by Nakajima X  X  method.
We propose a method to extract basis expressions that indicate economic trends from newspaper articles concerning economic trends and to classify basis expressions into positive or negative expressions. We considered that opinions concerning economic trends can be extracted by using b asis expressions, which enable us to distinguish two different types of opinions in the same articles. Our method used a bootstrap method that was minimally supervised algorithm for extracting basis expressions. Moreover, o ur method classified basis expressions into positive expressions or negative ones without dictionaries. As related work for extracting phrases that have a particular meaning, Kanayama et al. proposed a method for extracting a set of sentiment units by us-ing transfer-based machine translation engine replacing the translation patterns with sentiment patterns[5]. However, t o construct a complete list of complex rules or patterns manually, which is the case of the above methods, is a time-consuming and costly task. In contrast, our method uses statistical information and only one initial clue phrase as an initial input. The domain-specific dictio-naries, predetermined patterns, complex rules made by hand are not needed.
Wilson et al. proposed a method for d etermining whether an expression is neutral or polar[6]. In their research, the expressions are extracted manually and the method needs dictionaries. In contrast, our method automatically extracts expressions and does not need dictionaries.

Sakai et al. proposed a method for extracting cause information from Japanese financial articles concerning business performance[3]. Their work is probably most closely related to ours. However , our method extracts basis expression concerning not performance of each co mpany but economic trends. Moreover, our method also classifies basis expressions into positive and negative ones. As a preprocessing, our method extrac ts articles concer ning economic trends from newspaper corpus by using Support Vector Machine(SVM)[4]. We applied a method proposed by sakai et al.[2] for extracting them. As a result, 10,027 newspaper articles concerning economic trends were extracted from Nikkei news-papers published from 1990 to 2005.

Here, a basis expression is a part of a sentence consisting of some  X  bunsetu  X  X  X  (a bunsetu is a basic block in Japanese composed of several words). Our method extracts basis expressions by using clue phrases, i.e. phrases frequently modified by basis expressions. For example, a basi s expression frequently modifies clue phrase  X ( no eikyou : influenced by) X  in Japanese. Our method extracts an ex-pression that consists of a clue phrase and a phrase that modifies it as a basis expression. Hence, if many clue phrases eff ective for extracting basis expressions are acquirable, basis expressions are extracted automatically. However, it is hard to acquire sufficient clue phrases effectiv e for extracting basis expressions man-ually. Hence, our method also acquires s uch clue phrases automatically from a set of articles concerning economic trends.
 Our method for extracting basis expressions is as follows.
 Step 1: Input an initial clue phrase  X ( no eikyou : influenced by) X  and acquire Step 2: Extract phrases appearing frequently in a set of the phrases acquired Step 3: Acquire new clue phrases modified by the frequent phrases.
 Step 4: Extract new frequent phrases from a set of phrases that modify the Step 5: Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until they are executed predetermined times or Step 6: Extract basis expressions by using extracted frequent phrases and ac-3.1 Extraction of Frequent Phrases The method for extracting  X  X requent phrases X  from a set of phrases that modify clue phrases is described below.
 Step 1: Acquire a bunsetu modifying a clue phrase and eliminate a case particle Step 2: Acquire frequent phrase candidates by adding bunsetu modifying c to Step 3: Calculate score S f ( e, c ) of frequent phrase candidate e containing c by Step 4: Adopt e assigned the best score S f ( e, c ) among the set of frequent Score S f ( e, c ) is calculated by the following Formula 1: where P ( e, c ) is the probability that frequent phrase candidate e containing c appears in the set of articles concerning economic trends. f e ( e, c )isthenumber of frequent phrase candidate e  X  X  containing c in the set of articles concerning economic trends. f p ( e )isthenumberof bunsetu  X  X  that compose e . P ( e, c )is calculated by the following Formula 2.
 where Ne ( c ) is the total number of frequent phrase candidates containing c in the set of articles con cerning economic trends. 3.2 Selection of Frequent Phrases The frequent phrases extracted from a set of phrases that modify clue phrases may contain inappropriate ones. Hence, our method selects appropriate frequent phrases from them. Here, our m ethod calculates entropy H ( e ) based on P ( e, s ) and selects frequent phr ases assigned entropy H ( e ) larger than a threshold value calculated by Formula 5. P ( e, s ) is the probability that frequent phrase e modifies clue phrase s . Entropy H ( e ) is used for reflecting  X  X ariety of clue phrases modified by frequent phrase e  X . If entropy H ( e ) is large, frequent phrase e modifies various kinds of clue phrases and such a frequent phrase is an appropriate frequent phrase. Entropy H ( e ) is calculated by the following Formula 3.
 where Here, S ( e ) is the set of clue phrases modified by frequent phrase e . f ( e, s )isthe number of frequent phrase e  X  X  that modifies clue phrase s in the set of articles concerning economic trends. The threshold value is calculated by the following Formula 5.
 where N s is the set of clue phrases used for e xtracting frequent phrases and  X  is a constant (0 &lt; X &lt; 1).
 3.3 Acquisition of Clue Phrases The method for acquiring new clue phrases from frequent phrases is as follows. Step 1: Extract a bunsetu modified by frequent phrase e .
 Step 2: Acquire clue phrase s by adding a case particle contained in the frequent Step 3: Calculate entropy H ( s ) based on the probability P ( s, e )thatclue Step 4: Select clue phrase s assigned entropy H ( s ) larger than a threshold value Here, entropy H ( s ) is introduced for selecting appr opriate clue phrases and is calculated by the following Formula 6.
 Here, E ( s ) is the set of frequent phrases that modify clue phrase s ,and f ( s, e )is the number of clue phrase s  X  X  modified by frequent phrase e in the set of articles concerning economic trends. The threshold value is calculated by the following Formula 7.
 Here, N e is the set of frequent phrases used for extracting clue phrases.  X  is the same constant that in Formula 5. 3.4 Extraction of Basis Expressi ons by Using Frequent Phrases and Finally, our method extracts basis expressions by using frequent phrases and clue phrases. A basis expression consists of a phrase that modifies the clue phrase. Moreover, the phrase that modifies the clue phrase contains some fre-quent phrases. For example,  X ( yusyutu no gennsyou wo haikei ni : under decreas-ing export) X  is a basis expression since phrase  X ( yusyutu no gennsyou : decreasing export) X  modifies clue phrase  X ( wo haikei ni : under) X  and the phrase contains frequent phrase  X ( gensyou : decreasing) X . Our method classifies extracted basis exp ressions into positive expressions and negative expressions. However, extracted basis expressions contain some of inap-propriate basis expressions. As a result, our method extracted basis expressions into positive expressions, negative exp ressions and other expressions. Other ex-pressions are extracted basis expressions that are neither positive nor negative expressions.
For example,  X ( doujikakudai wo tudukeru sekaikeizai : world economy continu-ing simultaneous expansion) X  is a positive expression. Thus positive expressions indicate that Japanese economy is upbeat. For example,  X ( setubitoushi ya kojin-syouhi no donka : slowdown of business investment and personal consumption) X  is a negative expression. Thus negative expressions indicate that Japanese econ-omy is downturn. For example,  X ( tyousataisyouhenkou : change of objective for survey) X  and  X ( keiki no nobinayami : stagnation of economy ) X  are other expres-sions. We define expressions that cite Japanese economy are inappropriate as basis expressions, because our goal is extraction of basis expressions.
We develop two classifiers by using one-versus-rest method and Support Vec-tor Machine(SVM)[4]. The one classifies extracted basis expressions into positive expressions and the others. Here, a positive expression is defined as a correct expression and the other is defined as an incorrect expression . The other one classifies extracted basis expressions into negative expressions and the others. Here, negative expression is defined as a correct expression and the other is de-fined as an incorrect expression . The classifiers use character N-gram and word N-gram as features. In this section, we evaluate our method. Our method extracted basis expressions from 10,027 newspaper articles concerning economic trends and classify them into positive and negative.
 First, we evaluated our method for ext racting basis expressions. We employ CaboCha 2 as a Japanese parser. We manually extracted 75 basis expressions from 100 articles concerning economic t rends performance as a correct data set. Moreover, we extracted basis expressions by our method from the same 100 arti-cles and calculated precision and recall. Here, a basis expression extracted by our method is correct if it contains a basis ex pression extracte d as the correct data set. The precision, r ecall and F-measure 3 calculated by the following formulas. where Sb is the set of basis expressions extra cted by our method from 100 articles concerning economic trends. Ab is the set of basis expressions contained in the correct data set. Nb is the set of expressions modifying clue phrases in the 100 articles concerning eco nomic trends. The results are shown in Tabel 1. Next, we evaluated our method for classifying basis expressions. We employ ChaSen 4 as a Japanese morphological analyzer, and SV M light 5 as an imple-mentation of SVM. We extracted 1620 basis expressions by our method with  X  0.6 and iteration count 3. 1620 basis expressions were manually annotated with  X  X ositive X ,  X  X egative X  or  X  X thers X . The annotated basis expressions were divided into two sets. The first (1120 expressions) were a training data, used for feature selection and modeling. We used the seco nd set (500 expressions) as a test data set. We calculated precision, recall an d F-measure from the test data set. The precision and recall are calculated by the following formulas.
 Here, E is the set of basis expressions annotated with correct expressions in the test data set. C is the set of correct expressions contained in the test data set. The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3. In Table 1, precision rises from  X  0.5 to 0.6, while recall drops. When low  X  value is assigned, inappropriate clue phrases and frequent phrases were found in a set of extracted clue phrases and ext racted frequent phras es. Furthermore, new inappropriate ones are extracted by extracted inappropriate phrases. As a result, our method acquires many inappropriate ones. This happens when  X  is between 0.5 and 0.6.

In Tables 2 and 3, focusing on recall, it is interesting to note that negative classifiers perform better than positive ones. This is due to the fact that 1620 basis expressions contain negative expressions far more than positive ones. We consider that cause for few positive expressions is due to recession in Japan during the period of the corpus.

In Tables 2 and 3, focusing on precision, character N-gram feature classifier is the highest of all. This is due to the fact that characters play a key role in classifying expressions in Japanese, because Chinese characters that are one of the Japanese charact ers have meanings. We proposed a method for extracting basis expressions that indicate economic trends from Japanese newspaper articles concerning economic trends. First, our method extracts basis expressions from them by using statistical information and initial clue phrases. Next, our method classifies basis expressions into positive expressions , negative expressions and other expressions . This method can also be applied to other tasks such as extracting reputations for specific items.
