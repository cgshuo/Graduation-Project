 C orpus , as defined by Sinclair (1994 :2 ) , is  X  a collection of pieces of language that are selected and ordered according to explicit linguistic criteria in order to be used as a sample of the language X . In recent years, corpus -based researches have been increasingly applied to second language writing from pedagogical perspectives, and concordancing is for many reasons widel y regarded as a useful tool in the writing class ( Yoon, 2011:131). Scholars such as Yoon (2011:1 30 -13 9 ) ha ve proved that specialized corpora compiled for specific genres or disciplines enable learners to discover vocabulary, word combinations and grammatic al patterns. Corpora can also be a g oo d reference resource with which learners check if a specific element of the writing is correct. However, previous studies mainly focus on practices in classroom settings, and few studies have explored how profe s sional practitioners actually exploit the corpora in specific professional genre areas, especially medical field where linguistic support is badly needed.

In fact, clinicians in mainland China are under increasing pressure to publish their research results inter nationally on the most prestigious journals possible (Qiu, 2010). Assessments for job tenure and promotion require high publication outputs, as do competitive applications for research grant funding. It is almost axiomatic that this now means writing the m anuscripts in English (Ammon, 2001; Belcher, 2007), and in the style of English that meets the requirements of the journals concerned (Burrough -Boenisch, 2003; Langdon -Neuner, 2007 ; Cargill et al, 2012 ). This situation suggests that a rapidly increasing nu mber of Chinese clinicians need help to enhance their ability to wri te research articles in English , and a customized medical corpus could be an extremely useful resource to help them. However, so far there has not been any reported medical English corpus available for Chinese clinicians to use for this purpose, no matter in China or abroad. 
Computer -linguistic researchers and clinicians in mainland China are jointly working on a project to build the first customized medical corpus directly serving the act ual needs of clinicians for English research article writing in specifically targeted medical domain. As the pilot study of this project, we constructed a Customized Corpus for the Urology Team (CCUT), the target users of which are from a research group in one of the top 3A hospitals in China undertaking some natural science projects at national and provincial levels. Most of the members have had very limited practice in scientific writing in English , and some of them turn to l ocal English experts for help, but those experts (no matter native or non -native English speakers) also have difficulties in dealing effectively with the specific language features and discourses of the medicine content. With the help of CCUT, however, linguistic researchers can help t he clinicians carry out corpus -assisted English research article writing, and observe their behaviors in using the corpus. One of the team members, Dr. A, has used the CCUT under situated assistance from the linguistic researchers while writing a research article manuscript, which has latter been published on a SCI indexed journal. His behavior of using CCUT will be reported as a case below. A considerable number of studies have been conducted on corpus use in second language teaching, esp ecially writing instruction. Among them, most are about writing in ge n eral English ( Todd, 2001 ; Cresswell, 2007 ; Gaskell &amp; Cobb, 2004 ; Yoon &amp; Hirvela, 2004 ; Yoon, 2008 ; Kennedy &amp; Miceli, 2010 ; Flowerdew, 2010 ), and only a few are related to writing in an E SP (English for specific purposes) field, such as computer, business, forestry, and law . In the field of forestry , Friginal (2013) investigates the use of co r pora to develop the research report writing skills of college -level students enrolled in a profess ional forestry program. In the field of business English, Walke r (2011) examines h ow a corpus -based study of the factors which influence s collocation can help in the teaching . In the field of legal education, Hafner and Candlin (2007) explore the relationship between student use of online corpus tools and academic and professional discourse practices in a professional legal training course at The City University of Hong Kong. In the field of computer science, Chang &amp; Kuo (2011) take a corpus -based, genre -analytic approach to teaching materials development with a corpus of 60 research articles . Gavioli (2005) shows how the ana lysis of smaller speciali z ed corpora c an be used to heighten awareness of key lexical, grammatical or textual issues amongst learners of ESP. Although researchers focus on different aspects of corpora that could help students  X  wr i ting improvement, it is co mmonly agreed that most st u dents in such corpus -based teaching class find the corpus approach beneficial to students  X  writing practices. However, t h ose studies are pedagogically oriented, only focusing on teaching of students in classroom settings with the help of one or more corpora. Although teaching of ESP students is supposed to be career -oriented, how professional practitioners actually make use of corpora to improve their writing in workplace are hardly touched in the literature we found. What is more , research on corpus -assisted medical English wri t ing is even sparse. 
Meanwhile, there is also a lack of medical English corpora available for Chinese clinicians. To our know l edge, there are only very few medical English corpora which can be openly used f or language learning. GENIA , a corpus of articles extracted from MEDLINE database , is widely used in biomedical language processing ( Kim, 2003 ). However, focusing on biolog i cal reactions concerning transcription factors in human blood cells, it only select ed articles with the MeSH terms ( Kim, 2003 ) , so it is less applicable for clinicians in other medical fields. Other bio -medical English corpora are relatively small in size and mostly only open to limited users ( Gurulingappa, 2012). In China , PCMW (Chen &amp; Ge, 2011) is a valuable large scale English -Chinese parallel corpus of medical works , covering about 15 medical domains, such as paediatrics , gynecology , surgery, etc. M ainly targeted on the resource construction of co m puter ( -aided) translation , it is not openly applicable to medical professionals at the moment. Other medical English corpora reported in China are mainly used for linguistic research in stylistics (Ping 2010) or lexicology (Wang, 2008; Wang, 2010). As di s cussed above, so far there has not be en any report about direct application of medical English corpora by clinicians in their L2 learning. In order to bridge computational -linguistic research with the clinicians  X  actual needs, we establish a customized medical English corpus in the present st udy. Inspired by Z h eng (2012 )  X  s Eco -dialogical model of interaction , we design a model for the construction of customized medical corpus. As shown in Fig. 1, clinician s provide raw data, based on which the computer -linguistic researchers design and construct the corpus customized to the clinicians  X  needs in their specific medical domain. T h en the computer -linguistic researchers assist them in analyzing data while they write their articles, and provide step -b y -step training for corpus use. Finally, the clinicians provide feedback to the constructors so that they can further adapt and improve the corpus accordingly. The clinicians and computer -linguistic researchers work together to achieve meaning perception a nd realize values in actual writing action i n a dynamic and cyclic way.

Specifically, the construction procedure can be divided into the following stages: 1) Needs analysis: T h e computer -linguistic researchers and clinicians worked together to analyze the needs of target users through discussions and surveys so as to provide suggestions for corpus design. 2) Data collection: The source texts were directly coll ected from the medical team members, which include 240 medical research articles they downloaded from the PubMed database and shared within the team as core reference readings in recent years. As the team members have the same research direction  X  applicatio n of stem -cell technology in the field of urology, so the source texts mainly fall in the fields of stem -cell and urology. 3) Data cleaning and processing: L inguistic researchers converted pdf files the clinicians provided to txt format, and proofread all texts for two times. Illustrations irrelevant with the language information were deleted. Errors and unrecognizable codes were corrected or substituted after collat ing with the original pdf text and consulting the urologists when necessary. A corpus of 14 53138 word tokens in total was built (shown in Fig. 2). 4) Corpus sharing on the cloud: The corpus was uploaded to the cloud platform for members in the collaborative project to share. 5) Data application: In the application, the corpus analysis tool we c hose for clinicians to use is AntConc (Anthony) , a free software relatively easy to operate . Basic functions of AntConc, such as word search, KWIC display, collocates, and clusters, are introduced to the urology team members by the linguistic researchers w hile assisting their English writing. 6) Feedback collection for corpus improvement: Clinicians upload their feedback to the cloud, and the computer -linguistic researchers will summarize the feedback to further adapt the corpus for their needs in the next step.

The corpus we constructed could be used to implement a number of functions, including generating concordance lists (key word in context), visual concordance pl ots, wordlists, and key wordlists, extracting collocation and colligation, extracting terminology, computing collocate s alience , creating wordsketches ( summary of the word X  X  grammatical and collocational behavior ) and distributional t hesaurus (showing simi lar words in terms of grammatical and collocational behavior ), and designing  X  minitext  X  (extracts of concordance list for pedagogical use). The basic function -key word in context (KWIC) is similar to the search function of some online databases such as G oogle Scholar , but the KWIC function can allow more complicated and flexible search to discover collocation al and grammatical rules and patterns by inputting regular expressions . Moreover , the concordance results of KWIC in CCUT is much more targeted and t hus more useful for clinicians since its source texts are directly related to the clinicians' own medical research fields. An example of another function -wordlist is shown in Fig. 2, in which the wordlist of CCUT is generated to show the frequency of wo rds in the corpus, based on which linguistic researchers could further develop a syllabus of graded professional words for future English training in the targeted medical domain. Below we report a randomly selected user ( Dr. A) X  X  e xperience of applying CCUT while writing medical research article manuscript under the assistance of the linguistic researcher (the first author). Dr. A is a 35 -year -old urologist. Under great pressure of publication, he is always very interested in using CCUT to help his English writing. We started working with him since 2012 when he was a novice clinician. Over these years, by guiding him to perform corpus analysis, the linguistic researcher could at the same time observe his corpus use behavior directly. Based on our observation, his use of corpus mainly falls into the following four purposes  X  1) C hoosing a word of appropriate semantic relations in medical context
C linicians may feel hard to use even a common English word in the specialized medical context. For example, while writing a research article manuscript, Dr. A turned to the linguist ic researcher about how to express  X   X  X  X   X  (get) in English when describing the process of getting a certain cell. 
The linguistic researcher then guided him to analyze the target word in terms of semantic relations proposed by Sinclair (1991, 1996). As shown by Sinclair (1996) , corpus work accounts for at least four types of meaningful relations that words entertain with other words around them. In corpus linguistics, these are called: collocation, colligation, semantic preference and semantic prosody. Colloc ation is defined as  X  X he occurrence of two or more words within a short space of each other X  (Sinclair 1991:170). Colligation is, instead, the relationship between a word and a grammatical class of words. Semantic preference is the relationship between a wo rd and a semantic class of words. Semantic prosody does not only have to do with the relationship between words, but it also involves the way words affect each other with their meanings.  X  Prosody  X  is applied particularly to the way in which words or expres sions create an aura of meaning capable of affecting words around them ( Gavioli , 2005: 45 -46 ) .

A comparison of the selected concordance lines of  X  aquire  X  and  X  obtain  X  is shown in Table 1. The search for  X  acquire  X  in CCUT with AntConc provided 44 occurrenc es , showing that this is a relatively frequently used word in a medical context. However, at the collocates on the right of the node, most of the collocates were not biomedical entities, but mainly some abstract nature, characteristics or capacity of certa in biomedical entities, such as  X  properties  X  ,  X  characteristics  X  ,  X  ability  X  , and  X  expression  X  . The search for  X  obtain  X  in CCUT provided 57 occurences. We found the semantic relations of this word have special patterns in the medical context. For collocation , it is mostly collocated with biomedical entities, such as cell , tissue, fraction, material, and gene expression profiles. For colligation,  X  to obtain +NP  X  or  X  be+ adj. +obtain + NP  X  is the most salient pattern. For semantic preference, word combinations like  X  attempts to, able/unable to, could not, it took many years to, hard/difficult to  X  are associated with  X  obtain  X  , which all seemed to show certain difficulty in the obtaining action. Therefore, when it comes to the semantic prosody,  X  obtain  X  has the co nnotational associations of  X  successfulness after hard efforts  X  . All of the four scales of semantic relations of  X  obtain  X  matched Dr. A  X  s situation, i.e., to get some cells after great efforts of scientific research, so he confirmed that  X  X btain X  is the be st word to choose, rather than  X  acquire  X  . At the same time, he also made clear how to use  X  acquire  X  in other situations. 2) Finding medical grammatical patterns different from general English
While writing the manuscript , Dr. A came up with another question: S h ould he use grammatically correct, but he feels like seldom seeing  X  mouse  X  s cell  X  in medical literature reading. 
To answer this question, we searched  X  mouse  X  s  X  in BNC, and found occurrences heart  X  . A look into the collocates of  X  mouse  X  in BNC indicated that  X  X  s  X  is its most frequently used collocate. 
Surprisingly, a search for  X  mouse  X  s  X  in CCUT showed no concordance hit at all, but a further search for  X  mouse * cell*  X  instead provided 101 occurrences ( shown in Fig. 3 ) . To make this clear, we worked out in AntConc the 2 -word clusters of  X  mouse  X  sorted by frequency with  X  mouse  X  on the left in CCUT, the tops 3 expressions o n the list are  X  mouse embryonic  X  ,  X  mouse model  X  ,  X  mouse testis  X  , which in general English may be expressed as  X  mouse  X  s embryonic ... X  ,  X  mouse  X  s model  X  ,  X  mouse  X  s testis  X  .
 Being aware of the difference in grammatica l patterns - X  mouse +NP  X  in medical English vs  X  mouse(  X  s) + NP  X  in general English, Dr. A understood that he should follow the conventions in the medical context and wrote in his manuscript  X  mouse LCs  X  instead of  X  mouse  X  s LCs  X  and  X  mouse testes  X  instead o f  X  mouse  X  s testes  X  . 3) Learning how to use unfamiliar medical terms
For unfamiliar medical terms, the clinicians have to firstly consult medical English dictionaries to find the potential English equivalent words , but the example sentences might be insuff icient. Though CCUT is not useful in the first step of searching word -to -word equivalents , it provides more information than the dictionaries about how the word is used in context. For example, Dr. A searched an unfamiliar term - X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  ( immunostain ) in the new Comprehensive Medical English Dictionary (KingYee Ltd., 2016), a dictionary regarded as the most comprehensive and useful medical English dictionary in his circle , but he only found its equivalent English expression  X  immunostain  X  with no example se ntence at all. So we searched  X  immuno stain  X  in CCUT. The results are shown below. 
Though there were only 6 occ urrences , we noticed the recurrent pattern of  X  the immunostain was performed on ... X  , so Dr. A learned to use this pattern to make his sentence in the manuscript. B y analyzing concordances, corpus users can grasp the meanings and functions of the structures that were presented to them much better than when they were presented in the tradition al fashion ( Gavioli , 2005: 28). 4) Revising  X  Chinglish  X  ( unidiomatic ) expressions
The word combination Dr. A used for a subtitle in his manuscript was originally  X  X n vitro Nes -GFP+ cells differentiation X  , but he realized it might be  X  Chinglish  X  ( unidiomat ic ), and asked whether he needed to revise it in a more idiomatic way. To check whether this expression is unidiomatic , a search of  X  X ifferentiation capacity X  was generated, with 11 occurrences found ( Shown in Fig. 5 ). 
In all the 11 instances, the word on the left of  X  X ifferentiation capacity  X  were all attributive adjunct s, such as  X  in vitro  X  ,  X  multilineage  X  , and no expression of  X  X cell name] + differentiation capacity X  was found. The refore, the word  X  Nes -GFP + cells  X  might not be suitable to be put before  X  differentiation capacity  X  . From Line 5 and 7, we found that  X  in vitro  X  could be put before  X  differentiation capacity  X  to be an attributive adjunct, so we decided to use the word comb ination of  X  in vitro differentiation capacity  X  .

As for where to put  X  Nes -GFP + cells  X  , in the concordance lines we found  X  differentiation capacity +of +[entity name]  X  in Line 2, 6, 8, 9 (in case the entity differentiates) and  X  differentiation capacity + to + [entity name]  X  in Line 10 (in case the entity is the result of differentiation). So Dr. A revised the original subtitle  X  in vitro Nes -GFP + cells differentiation capacity  X  to  X  in vitro differentiation capacity of Nes -GFP + cells  X  .

As the Chinese language i s characteristic of parataxis (words are connected by implicit coherence), and the English language is characterized by hypotaxis (words are connected by explicit cohesive devices), t he missing of the connective  X  of  X  in the ori g inal subtitle might be cause d by the negative transfer from Chinese. Just as this case shows, clinicians can use the CCUT corpus to explore  X  X diomatic X  areas of language and even repair the negative transfer from their mother language . The corpus under our construction is different from other kinds of non -customized corpora traditionally built by the corpus -linguists in that: 1) I t is jointly developed by medical and computer -linguistic researchers ; 2) Though it could also be used for linguistic analysis, it is user -oriente d in that its primary function is to serve the clinicians; 3) I ts source texts are provided by the clinicians so that it is highly r e lated to the specific researc h domain of the users; 4) Computer -linguistic researchers not only help the clinicians build t he corpus, but also provide situated assistance, corpus use training, and guidance for data analysis step by step to make sure the users can really make effective use of the corpus; 5) Computer -linguistic researchers collect user feedbacks from the clinici ans and further develop the corpus according to target users  X  needs; 6) While the computer -linguistic researchers play the roles of designers, constructors, data analysts, assistants and trainers, the clinicians play the roles of source providers, main cor pus users , data analysts, feedback providers, and trainees . The relationships among the computer -linguistic researchers, clinicians and corpus are dialogical and dynamic.

With the joint efforts of the computer -linguistic researchers and the clinicians, t he customized corpus has been proved to provide targeted language learners with invaluable information, especially the recurrent , conventional lexical and syntactic patterns in specialized context, the usage of specialized words that could not be found suffi ciently described in dictionaries , and the way s to test one  X  s intuitions so as to repair certain negative transfer from C h inese to English. In the situated guidance, it is essentially important for linguistic researchers to guide the clinician s to graduall y increase their sensitivity and awareness of the conventions in the medical context through the clues provided by the corpus. If such kind of training keeps running, the clinicians could enhance their language intuitions, and get more and more familiar wi th the discourse of the ir specialized community. However, one thing worth noting is how to transfer  X  from maximum guidance to maximum independence X  (Gavioli , 2005: 127 ) so that the clinician s can be independent analyzers finally. After the clinicians get f amiliar enough with the corp u s in the situated guidance, training workshops will be organized to summarize the ways of corpus use, and multi -media demo videos, guid e books will be o f fered to help the m . 
T here are some limitations for the current preliminar y study. The ways of application are still limited, and empirical evaluations need to be collected after larger -scale application. As the pilot study for our project on the customized medical English corpus, CCUT is limited to the domain of stem cell and u rology. As the research goes, our project will extend the customized medical corpus to include more medical domains. This paper discusses the construction of cu stomized medical c orpus CCUT and shows how urologist s from the medical research te am applied CCUT to aid their research article manuscript writing in E n glish. With the situated guidance of the linguistic researcher s , CCUT has been effectively used to help clinicians choose the word of appropriate semantic relations, find grammatical pat terns different from general English in specialized medical context, make use of unfamiliar medical terms and revise unidiomatic expressions. Our case study presented that it is not only possible but also worthwhile to introduce clinicians to corpus lingui stics through a dialogical , cyclic and goal -oriented collaboration between the computer -linguistic researchers and clinicians on customized corpus.
