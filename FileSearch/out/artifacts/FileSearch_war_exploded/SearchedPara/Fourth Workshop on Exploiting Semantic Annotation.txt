 There is an increasing amount of structure on the Web as a result of modern Web languages, user tagging and annotation, and emerg-ing robust NLP tools. These meaningful, semantic, annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information access, by enhancing the depth of analysis of today X  X  systems. Currently, we have only started exploring the possibilities and only begin to un-derstand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use. Unleashing the potential of semantic annotations requires us to think outside the box, by combining the insights of natural lan-guage processing (NLP) to go beyond bags of words, the insights of databases (DB) to use structure efficiently even when aggregating over millions of records, the insights of information retrieval (IR) in effective goal-directed search and evaluation, and the insights of knowledge management (KM) to get grips on the greater whole.
This workshop aims to bring together researchers from these dif-ferent disciplines and work together on one of the greatest chal-lenges in the years to come. The desired result of the workshop will be to gain concrete insight into the potential of semantic an-notations, and in concrete steps to take this research forward; to synchronize related research happening in NLP, DB, IR, and KM, in ways that combine the strengths of each discipline; and to have a lively, interactive workshop where every participant contributes actively and which inspires attendees to think freely and creatively, working towards a common goal.

There are many forms of annotations and a growing array of techniques that identify or extract information automatically from texts: geo-positional markers; named entities; temporal informa-tion; semantic roles; opinion, sentiment, and attitude; certainty and hedging to name a few directions of more abstract information found in text. Furthermore, the number of collections which explic-itly identify entities is growing fast with Web 2.0 and Semantic Web initiatives. In some cases semantic technologies are being deployed in active tasks, but there is no common direction to research initia-tives nor in general technologies for exploitation of non-immediate textual information, in spite of a clear family resemblance both with respect to theoretical starting points and methodology. We believe Data Curation Annotations may live inside documents, or be stored Result Aggregation Whereas IR focuses almost exclusively at find-The Workshop will conclude with a final session addressing the best way forward to unleash the potential of semantic annotation.
We requested the submission of short, 2 page papers to be pre-sented as boaster and poster. We accepted a total of 13 papers out of 15 submissions.

Damljanovi  X  c et al. [2] discuss virtual documents as a way to unify data driven approach in IR, and knowledge driven approaches in DB and KM.

De Graaf [3] report on the annotation and retrieval of knowledge in software documentation.

Kamps [4] constructs a model of interaction for complex tasks, and the different information flow and success criterion of each phase, framing the role of annotation throughout a search episode.
Karlgren [6] discusses three interconnected challenges and re-search questions in exploiting and modelling affective and emotive aspects of information access: how to model the mood or affectual state of the user, the emotive content of an information object, and the utility of doing so. Marshall [7] studies the completeness and relative value of image tags and how this impacts image similarity evaluation.

Murakami and Ura [8] propose a decimal classification system for people on the Web, leading to capture semantic labels and hier-archical relations.

Narr et al. [9] apply NLP approach to annotate entities, persons, and events in tweets, improving access through normalization and taxonomic relations.

Ng [10] discusses the annotation of word senses and argues that renewed analysis will increase of understanding when it works and why.

Pareti [11] focuses on identifying the source of a statement and the relation between the source and the message, and how this at-tribution helps retrieval and interpretation.

R X j [12] discuss how the discovery and retrieval of application program interfaces (APIs) can benefit from rich semantic annota-tion.

Sapkota et al. [13] extract models from regulatory texts (con-taining regulations, policies, mandates and guidelines for organiza-tions) from different sources using semantic annotation.

Trandabat [14] proposes semantic role labeling as a means to encode context of and relations between entities occurring in texts.
Tsatsaronis [15] studies sources of lexical ambiguity: syntactic ambiguity across syntactic categories and semantic ambiguity due
