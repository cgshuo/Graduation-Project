Multi-pose face r ecognition based on a single view has high research value because it can be used in a wide range of practical applications. The study of multi-pose face recognition technolo gy based on a single view can be divided into two primary categories, i.e., pose cor rection methods and virtual multi-pose image synthesizing methods. Virtual multi-po se image synthesizing methods can improve the accuracy of face recognition because th ey generate appro-priate virtual multi-pose face ima ges to enrich training sample s. 
Among virtual multi-pose image sy nthesizing methods, three-dime nsional (3D) face morphable models are an impor tant area of research. The es tablishment of this model is based on a set of 3D faces [5]. However, original 3D f ace data cannot be used for linear calculation because the numbers of vertices and patches are different for each 3D face. It is necessary for all vertices and patches of the 3D faces to have one-to-one correspondence. A large number of methods have been proposed for dense correspondence of 3D f aces. Blanz et al. proposed an optical fl ow algorithm and a bootstrapping algorithm to solve the dense correspondence probl em of 3D faces [6, 7]. The method is valid when the 3D face is similar to the refe rence face. Yongli Hu et al. proposed a dense corresp ondence method based on a grid r esampling method, and the result was more accurate [8]. However, the process was very complicated because considerable manual inter action was required. Gu et al. proposed a uniform grid resampling algorithm [9]. Gong Xun et al. proposed a grid resampling method based on a planar template [10]. The method located features ba sed on a combination of two-dimensional (2D) and 3D texture information, and divided the surface of a 3D face using these features. 
To simplify the construction of a 3D face model, an improved de nse correspond-ence method based on planar templ ate resampling with geometric information is pro-posed in this paper. A 3D face is reconstructed using a 3D spar se morphable model, and multi-pose face images are generated using texture mapping, model rotation, and projection. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In S ection 2, an improved dense correspondence method based on planar template resampling with geometric information is proposed. In Section 3, 3D face reconstruction b ased on the 3D face morphable model is presented. In Section 4, the experiments per formed using BJUT-3D and CAS-PEAL-R1 databases are described, and the propos ed method is compared to other methods. Finally, conclusions are stated in S ection 5. 2.1 Definition of planar template After face segmentation on the cylindrical expansion of the ori ginal 3D faces, seg-mented 2D texture maps are aligned using the nose tip positions and overlapped. Among the overlapped points, the pixels that belong to more tha n half of the images are used to construct a planar template, which is shown in Figu re 1 (a). built using these vertices to construct a normalized 3D face mo del. The topological structure is constructed throu gh the following steps: First, ve rtices are connected ac-cording to the connection rules of vertices on the vertical and horizontal iso-lines. Then, each small rectangular area is divided into two triangles by the diagonal be-are numbered from top to bottom and left to right, which is sho wn in Figure 1 (b). The template can be used to generate the normalized 3D face model. 2.2 Resampling of original 3D faces and it is necessary to resample it.

After arranging the resampled data according to the topology st ructure of the pla-nar template, each 3D face can b e represented as two vectors. B value, N is the number of 3D faces, and n is the number of facial points on the 3D face. Values with the same subscript represent the same faci al feature points on different face vectors. 3D face reconstruction based on a sparse morphable model consis ts of two steps, i.e., model construction and face shape reconstruction. The first ste p involves acquisition and normalization of prototype 3 D face data and establishment o f a 3D morphable model. The second step is to match a target face image with the morphable model and accomplish the reconstruction of the face. 3.1 Construction of 3D morphable model Normalized 3D faces have an equal number of vertices and patche s. They can be re-garded as a linear space, where each element can be expressed l inearly using other elements. The shape of a 3D face can be expressed as equation ( 10). vertices, and m is the number of 3D faces. The linear space con structed using m 3D faces can be expressed as equation (11). tion (12) can be rewr itten as equation (13). plies that a specific face can be obtained using a deformation on the average face. 3.2 Face shape reconstruction based on sparse morphable model Face shape reconstruction based on the sparse morphable model c an be described as the analysis of global shape deformation, s  X  , according to the shape deformation, where L represents the selected feature points. of the objective function, as shown in equation (15) . where the first term represents reconstruction error, the secon d term represents ran-dom fluctuation, which improves the robustness of the model to noise, and 0  X   X  is an adjusting parameter. 
According to singular value decomposition, equation (16) is obt ained by taking the derivative of  X  with respect to the objective function. where l l R U  X   X  and ' ' m m R V  X   X  . 
Combining equation (16) with equation (13), the final reconstru ction result of the given face can be described as equation (17). 4.1 3D face database and the s egmentation performance The BJUT-3D database [11] is use d to evaluate the performance o f the proposed method. There are approximately 200000 vertices and 400000 tria ngular faces for one 3D face model. An example of ori ginal 3D face data is shown in Figure 2. Face seg-mentation results based on geometric information are shown in F igure 3. 4.2 Dense correspondence performanc e of the proposed method The data of 100 3D faces from the BJUT-3D database, consisting of 50 females and 50 males, are used to evaluate the dense correspondence perform ance of the proposed method. A comparison between the original 3D point cloud data a nd the dense corre-spondence results is shown in Figure 4. It can be observed from Figure 4 that the 3D face database can be normalized u sing the proposed method and i s suitable for linear operations to be performed later. 4.3 3D reconstruction results of the proposed method A hundred face images with a natural expression and no light va riation are used from the CAS-PEAL-R1 database to evaluate the reconstruction perform ance of the pro-posed method. Two original face images are shown in Figure 5 (a ). The images are normalized to a size of 164  X  146 pixels. The 3D reconstruction results obtained using the proposed method are shown in Figure 5 (b). The texture mapp ing results are shown in Figure 5 (c). Figure 5 (d)-(n) show the multi-pose res ults obtained by rota-tion and projection of the 3D faces. Figures 5 (d), (e), and (f ) show the projected re-sults of 15 X , 30 X , and 45 X  rotation, for the pose of looking in front horizontally. Fig-for the pose of looking down. Figures 5 (k), (l), (m), and (n) show the projected re-sults of 0 X , 15 X , 30 X , and 45 X  rotation, for the pose of lookin g up. 4.4 Recognition results of the proposed method A hundred subjects with a natural expression and no light varia tion are used from the CAS-PEAL-R1 database to evaluate the performance of the propose d method for face recognition. Twelve multi-pose i mages for each subject obtained by rotation and pro-jection of the 3D sparse morphable model, as described in secti on 4.3, are used as training samples. Five real multi-pose face images for each sub ject are used as testing samples. The performance of the proposed method is compared to that of convention-al methods, and the results are shown in table 1. 
For the enhanced projection-combined principal component analys is ((PC) 2 A) method, the recognition rate is relatively low. This is primari ly because the new im-ages are dependent and are highly correlated with the original image. The recognition sparse matrix (TPSM) method are relatively high because a prior i information about 3D face data is used. For the pr oposed method, training images are enriched by rota-tion and projection of the reconstructed 3D face. It can be obs erved from table 1 that the recognition rate of the proposed method is 91%, which is su perior to state-of-the-art met hods for pose-invarian t face recognition. To synthesize virtual multi-po se faces, a 3D face reconstructio n method based on a single view is proposed in this paper. This method includes thr ee aspects. The first is planar template establishment based on geometric information. T he second is vertical and horizontal resampling of 3D face data based on the geometri c relationship be-tween the planar template and original 3D face data, based on w hich normalized 3D face data is obtained. The third is that a 3D sparse morphable model is constructed based on the normalized 3D face data, and multi-pose face image s are generated by texture mapping, rotation, and projection of the established 3D face. The proposed method has two contributions. First, the dense correspondence p rocess is performed automatically and the model construction process does not invol ve manual interac-tion, which makes it superior to other methods. Second, virtual multi-pose face imag-es are synthesized using the proposed method and training sampl es are enriched, be-cause of which recognition performance improves. 
A pose-invariant face recognition problem without illumination variations is con-sidered in this study. Face recognition with pose and illuminat ion variations is more difficult. Future research will focus on a pose-invariant face recognition problem with illumination variations based on a single view.
