PAKDD 2009, the 13th in the series, was held in Bangkok, Thailand during April 27-30, 2008. PAKDD is a major interna-tional conference in the areas of data mining (DM) and knowledge discovery in database (KDD). It provides an international forum for researchers and indus-try practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practi-cal development experiences from all KDD-related areas including data mining, data warehousing, machine learning, databases, statistics, knowledge acquisi-tion and automatic scientific discovery, data visualization, causal induction and knowledge-based systems.
 regions in Asia, Australia, North America, South America, Europe, and Africa. Every submission was rigorously revie wed by at least three reviewers with a double blind protocol. The initial results were discussed among the reviewers and finally judged by the Program Committee Chairs. When there was a conflict, an additional review was provided by the Program Committee Chairs. The Program Committee members were deeply involved in the highly selective process. As a result, only 39 papers (approximately 11.5% of the 338 submitted papers) were accepted as regular papers, 73 paper s (21.6% of them) were accepted as short papers.
 cific Asia Workshop on Intelligence an d Security Informat ics (PAISI 2009), a workshop on Advances and Issues in Biomedical Data Mining (AIBDM 2009), a workshop on Data Mining with Imbalanced Classes and Error Cost (ICEC 2009), a workshop on Open Source in Data Mining (OSDM 2009), and a workshop on Quality Issues, Measures of Interestingness and Evaluation of data mining mod-els (QIMIE 2009). PAKDD 2009 would not have been successful without the support of committee members, reviewers, workshop organizers, tutorial speak-ers, invited speakers, competition organizers, organizing staffs, and supporting organizations. We are indebted to the members of Steering Committee for their invaluable suggestions and support throughout the organization process. We highly appreciate the Program Committee members, and external reviewers for their technical effort in providing straightforward scientific comments and im-partial judgments in the review process of PAKDD 2009. We thank our Tuto-rial Co-chairs Vincent S. Tseng and Shusaku Tsumoto for kindly coordinating the fruitful tutorials. We wish to thank our General Workshop Co-chairs Man-abu Okumura and Bernhard Pfahringe for selecting and coordinating the great workshops. Many thanks are given to the distinguished keynote speakers, in-vited speakers and tutorial presenters for their attractive and motivational talks and lectures. We thank the General Co-chairs Masaru Kitsuregawa and Vilas Wuwongse for their useful guidance and their sharp advice in various spectrums related to the conference arrangements. We are also grateful to the Local Ar-rangements Chair Chotirat Ratanamahatana and our Local Arrangements Com-mittee in both Thammasat University and Chulalongkorn University for their unlimited help toward the success of the conference. Last but not the least, we would like to give special thanks to Cholwich Nattee, who arranged the publi-cation of PAKDD 2009 in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series, and to Wirat Chinnan and Swit Phuvipadawat for their support of the PAKDD 2009 conference website. While the arrangement of PAKDD 2009 involved so many people, we would like to extend an additional thank-you to those who contributed to PAKDD 2009 but whose names may not be listed.
