 State of the art web search systems enable aggregation of information from many sources. Users are challenged to as-sess the reliability of information from different sources. We report on an empirical user study on the effect of display-ing credibility ratings of multiple cultural heritage sources (e.g. museum websites, art blogs) on users X  search perfor-mance and selection. The results of our online interactive study ( N = 122) show that when explicitly presenting these ratings, people become significantly more confident in their selection of information from aggregated results.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: [Selection process]; H.3.7 [ Digital Libraries ]: User issues Design, Experimentation, Human Factors. Consider a student who is looking for information about Dutch painters in the 17th century who made portraits in a certain artstyle. This information may be found online, but bits and pieces may exist on different HTML web pages, Wikipedia articles, weblogs, etc. The student has to choose which pages to look at from a large number of results pre-sented in the search result page. Before making this deci-sion, s/he may examine where the information comes from and who wrote it before looking at the article itself.
The situation above occurs frequently to all of us daily in slightly different settings. Many web search aggregators enable us to find information from different sources simulta-neously. For example, Google News 1 , a search engine that harvests and aggregates the latest information from 25,000 news sources, or WorldCat 2 a union catalog of more than 10,000 libraries. These systems enable us to retrieve infor-mation from multiple sources quickly but the decision as to which information source to go for is something that is left to the user. When interacting with such systems, we constantly need to assess the credibility of the sources, the authors and http://news.google.com/ http://www.worldcat.org/ the content. In this decision process, the source credibility aspect plays an important role in determining how people accept and retain information that is delivered to them [4].
Tseng et.al [7] explained that computer/system credibil-ity is interpreted as believability [7]  X  with 2 dimensions: the trustworthiness dimension of credibility that captures the  X  X ruthful X , and  X  X nbiased X  and the expertise dimension of credibility that captures the perceived knowledge and  X  X om-petence X . Researchers have been increasingly aware of the importance of (source) credibility in interaction between hu-mans and systems since the explosion of Web-based infor-mation [6]. Even though the number of information aggre-gators is expanding [5], there are still few studies that report on how the added complexity of having to deal with multi-ple information sources influences the users X  ability to make decisions and select the  X  X elievable X  information.
In Cultural Heritage, source credibility is one of the most important factors that determines whether people accept or decline an information [1]. Results from [3] indicate that transparency can positively influence acceptance of recom-mendation results from a single source. In the case of multi-ple sources from an information aggregator, users may also benefit from more transparency. By presenting the origin of the information and the ratings of other users, a more in-formed decision could be made. We expect this to result in greater information acceptance. This leads to the following hypothesis: Displaying the  X  X ource credibility X  will give users greater confidence in the information they select.
The effects of multiple sources and source credibility were assessed on search performance and user confidence. In or-der to do this, we carried out an experiment with repeated measures with number of sources (few = 4 sources, many = 12 sources) and source credibility (ratings visible or not vis-ible) as between-subject variables. Fig. 1 shows an example for two conditions: few sources/with credibility ratings (FR) and few sources/no credibility ratings (FN). It includes a ti-tle, snippets and an art work. The 2 other conditions  X  many sources/with credibility ratings(MR) and many sources/no credibility ratings(MN)  X  have the same look and feel. The source credibility ratings were obtained by soliciting user assessments of the sources in a previous study [2].
An interactive online survey was developed in which par-ticipants were randomly and automatically assigned to one of the four conditions, each with 3 variations of the same Figure 1: Top : few sources/no credibility ratings condition (FN). Bottom : few sources/with credibil-ity ratings condition (FR). task (using 3 unknown art works), also in random order. The task is to make a selection of the most accurate infor-mation about the art work. After each task, subjects were asked to rate the level of confidence of their decision. The time that was required by the user to complete the tasks (in seconds) was recorded automatically.

The dependent variables measured were efficiency (the time it took a participant to finish the search task in sec-onds), and a participant X  X  confidence in the accuracy of the selected information. We also checked whether they rely on the content of the information, or the source. Additionally, for the rating conditions (FR and MR), we asked an extra question on the credibility visualization. The responses of participants were expressed on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Not confident, 5 = Very confident).

We recruited in total 122 participants, equally divided in the 4 conditions, most of them were students or research staff at Dutch research institutes. Gender was balanced equally, the mean age of the subjects was 29 years old (SD = 10.15).
In the analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) test was per-formed to check for the effects across the four groups 3 on a 95% confidence interval. A significant effect was found on confidence using the K-W test (  X  2 (3) = 11.16, p = .011, 2-tailed). Scores on confidence were highest for both the many sources with credibility ratings -MR (M = 3.90) and the few sources with credibility ratings -FR (M = 4.19) con-ditions. Therefore we can accept the hypothesis: displaying the  X  X ource credibility X  ratings does give users greater confi-dence in the information they select.

There was also a significant effect on efficiency (  X  2 (3) = 17.80, p = .000, 2-tailed). The efficiency was surprisingly the highest (required least time) for the few sources/no rating condition, where the average rank was 47.16 (M = 214.26) and the many sources/no ratings condition with an average rank of 69.63 (M = 458.03). This means that the trade-off of the confidence boost by making the source credibility transparant is more required time to make an assesment.
Nonparametric statistics are used as the data did not meet parametric assumptions.

There is also a statistical significant strong relationship between source and answer for choosing information when people are confronted with the few sources conditions (see Fig. 2). For the many sources conditions, there may be other relationships which needs to be explored in future research.
This study contributes to the scant research on interaction with applications that aggregates information from multiple sources. We investigated how displaying source credibility ratings influences people X  X  behavior when accessing informa-tion. We found that performance is negatively influenced when users have to select information from many sources as compared with few sources, as people relied less on the given information, were less confident, and needed signifi-cantly more time as the number of information sources in-creased. However, we also found that presenting credibility ratings boosts the confidence level when people need to de-cide what information to choose as the number of sources in-creases. By making the source credibility ratings available, users can select information significantly more confidently. [1] A. Amin, J. van Ossenbruggen, L. Hardman, and [2] A. Amin, J. Zhang, H. Cramer, L.
