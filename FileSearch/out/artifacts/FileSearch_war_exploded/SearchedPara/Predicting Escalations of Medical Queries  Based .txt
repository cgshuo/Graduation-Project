 Logs of users X  searches on Web h ealth topics can exhibit signs of escalation of medical concerns, where initial queries about com-mon symptoms are followed by que ries about serious, rare ill-nesses. We present an effort to predict such escalations based on the structure and content of pages encountered during medical search sessions. We construct and then characterize the perfor-mance of classifiers that predict whether an escalation will occur after the access of a page. Our findings have implications for ranking algorithms and the design of search interfaces. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  search process , selection process Experimentation, Human Factors Medical search, cyberchondria Web search engines are used frequently by consumers to access health information [4]. Although such retrieved information can be invaluable, problems may arise when Web search is relied upon for diagnosis, where queries describing symptoms are input and rank and results are interpre ted as diagnostic conclusions. Prior research identified search and browsing sessions where que-ries on symptoms associated largely with common, benign expla-nations can lead to searches on more serious, rare ailments [7]. Such escalations may be based in several factors, including the relatively large quantity of Web content describing serious ill-nesses versus benign explanations , and the potential use of rank-ing algorithms based on clickthr ough data. Presenting people with troubling health scenarios without information on the probabilities of these outcomes, or on the typi cally greater likelihoods of more common explanations, can heighten concerns inappropriately [6]. Previous studies have explored the effects of factors such as page design and content on the perceptions of health information seek-ers [3][5] and on actions such as self-diagnosis a nd self-treatment [1], and have showed that, while 80% of American adults have searched for healthcare information online, 75% refrain from verifying key quality indicators su ch as source valid ity and source creation date [4]. We focus here on predicting escalations in que-ries based on the structure and co ntent of Web pages. We specifi-cally build classifiers to predict whether an escalation will occur immediately following a page visit. Accurate predictions of esca-lations in medical concerns give n page features allows search systems to flag specific pages as potential sources of inappropriate anxiety or down-weight such pa ges in their result ranking. We studied anonymized logs of URLs visited by users who opted in to provide data through a wide ly distributed browser toolbar. Log entries include a user identifier, a timestamp for each page view, and the URL of the page visited. Intranet and secure (https) URL visits were excluded at source. Only entries generated in the English speaking United States locale were included. From these logs, we mined many thousands of search sessions. Sessions start with a search engine query followed by a click on a search engine result. We consider sessions to be a sequence of time-ordered URLs terminating after 30 minutes of user inactivity (as in [7]). We define query escalations as observed increases in the medical severity of search terms used wi thin single health-related search sessions. For the purpose of the study, we examined the query terminology for sessions contai ning queries on six common symp-toms: headache, chest pain, muscle twitches, abdominal pain, nausea, and dizziness . We identified cases where users transition from a query about one of these basic symptoms to queries on a related, but serious illness within a search session. We focus on two outcomes following a query about a basic symptom: 1. Next-query escalation : Following visits to pages after a query, an escalation occurs on the next follow-up query. 2. Any-query escalation : Following visits to pages after a query, an escalation occurs on any follow-up query within a session. Lists of terms for expressing the six basic symptoms and terms for expressing serious illnesses for each of the symptoms were con-structed through review of the me dical literature as well as the browsing of portions of the search logs by the authors, one of whom received medical training during a PhD/MD program (EH). Lookup into these lists was used to identify candidate sessions and escalations in the queries present in session logs. Predicting escalations requires id entifying non-escalations as well as escalations. Non-escalations are defined in several ways: 1. Follow-up query is benign as explicitly defined. 2. Follow-up query not associated with defined escalation or non-escalation (hereafter called an undefined non-escalation ). 3. Session terminates w ithout escalation. Figure 1 illustrates these definitions graphically, with  X  as queries, boxes as pages, and  X  as the page from which features would be generated in each case. In our st udy, we experiment with the pre-diction accuracy for each of these definitions of non-escalations. We constructed classifiers to pred ict whether a user X  X  next query following a page visit contains an escalation or a non-escalation based on features of that page. We built the models using logistic regression, considering the outcome for each identified session and a set of over 40 features repr esenting attributes of the struc-ture and content of pages. Space limitations preclude detailing the entire feature list. However, in summary the features used include: 
Figure 1. Escalations and non-escalations in search sessions. structural features (e.g., serious illness precedes benign explana-tion, number of words between serious illness and benign expla-nation, modifiers such as  X  X nlikely to be X  appear near serious illnesses), title and URL features (e.g., title has serious illness, is forum URL), first-person testimonials (e.g., page has phrases such as  X  X old me X ,  X  X  felt X , and  X  X  am worried X ), page reliability fea-tures (e.g., page is externally ve rified by healthonnet.org, recom-mends consulting physician), comme rcial intent features (e.g., page has advertisemen ts, number of advertis ement blocks), and general page features (e.g., length in words, total kilobytes). We used a set of six thousand Web pages sampled randomly from our data. In initial analyses, we separately probed the predictive value of single features. For example, we considered the influence on escalation of the order in which serious illnesses versus benign explanations appeared on the page s viewed (for pages containing both serious illnesses and benign explanations). Table 1 shows the boost in escalations asso ciated with viewing pages that relay in-formation about serious disorder s before discussing benign expla-nations as compared with viewi ng pages with the reverse order-ing. One explanation for this ph enomenon is that users may not read the full page (as supported by eye-tracking research [2]). Each page is associated with an escalation or non-escalation in the query immediately foll owing it. We selected an equal number of escalations and non-escal ations (such that the accuracy of a mar-ginal model that predicted escal ation was 50%), and used five-fold cross-validation. Prediction accuracy varied with definitions of escalation and non-escalation. The highest accuracy was ob-tained for next-query escalati ons and defined non-escalations (73.4%), followed by next query escalation wher e non-escalation is session end (70.7%), and next-query escalation where the esca-lation is undefined (68.8%), a nd finally any-query escalation (65.5%). Performance differences we re statistically significant (at  X  &lt; .01) between all methods across 100 runs. Figure 2 shows the receiver-operator characteristic curves for one of the runs. Our findings show that we can ge nerate potentially valuable pre-dictions about escalations using pa ge features, and that accuracy varies with the definition of es calations and non-es calations. Best performance is obtained when non-escalations come from a de-fined set of benign explanations with no queries between concern and escalation. The most predictive features for all models are: Table 1. Percentage of escalations versus non-escalations given order of serious and benign co nditions on the preceding page. Query outcome Serious first Benign first Non-escalation 31.4% 66.6% serious illness precedes benign explanation in page, serious illness vs. benign explanation appears in page title or near beginning of page, page from Web forum, and pa ge has external verification. We studied the prediction of escala tions of queries for health in-formation on the Web based on fe atures of accessed pages. The results have implications for the design of search engines that may use escalation likelihood as a ranki ng feature or present this in-formation to users. Future direct ions include the leveraging of the richer rhetorical structure of pa ge content to introduce additional structural features. We also hope to investigate the predisposition to escalate based on features of users, examine cumulative effects of multiple session pages, and study the influence of contents displayed on search results pages.
