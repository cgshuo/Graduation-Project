 We introduce the use of negative prefer ences to pro duce so-lutions that are acceptable to a group of users. This tech-nique tak es adv antage of the fact that disco vering what a user does not like can be easier than disco vering what the user does like. To illustrate the approac h, we implemen ted Adaptiv e Radio, a system that selects music to play in a shared environmen t. Rather than attempting to play the songs that users want to hear, the system avoids playing songs that they do not want to hear. Negativ e preferences could poten tially be applied to information ltering, intelli-gen t environmen ts, and collab orativ e design.

It can be dicult for groups of people to agree on any-thing. These decisions can be as mundane as deciding where every one in your oce wants to go for lunc h or what movie you and your friends want to see, or they can be as imp or-tan t as nding a single solution that satis es a group of col-lab orating designers. A standard approac h to this problem would be to have the mem bers of the group express their individual preferences then attempt to nd a compromise solution that is the intersection or average of their desires. These intersections can be hard to nd, or even non-existen t. We prop ose the use of negative prefer ences to help groups nd common ground. If eac h individual lists the kinds of solutions that he or she doesn't want, then the union of the lists de nes the set of solutions that are not satisfactory to the group. The complemen t of this set can be considered poten tially good solutions that the group can explore. Al-though using negativ e preferences is formally equiv alen t to using positiv e preferences, they di er in practice. We be-liev e that the use of negativ e preferences will be bene cial for groups that need to nd solutions to satisfy all of their mem bers. To illustrate these principles, we presen t a new application, Adaptiv e Radio, whic h plays music in a shared environmen t.
Finding group-appro ved solutions using negativ e prefer-ences is distinct from collab orativ e ltering. Collab orativ e ltering uses the preferences of others to help an individual mak e choices [5]. A typical example is a system that recom-mends items to purc hase based on individuals with a similar purc hase history . By harnessing the collectiv e preferences of man y individuals, suc h systems can infer similarit y between items. This approac h is useful when it is dicult to quan-tify the similarit y between items, suc h as for art or music, and is used by man y music sharing applications, suc h as Last.FM (http://www.last.fm). Unlik e collab orativ e lter-ing, the negativ e preferences approac h is simply a way for groups of users to consolidate their preferences so that group recommendations can be made. Negativ e preference appli-cations could poten tially incorp orate collab orativ e ltering techniques to determine the similarit y between solutions.
A few other systems recommend items to groups instead of individuals. MusicFX [6] selects music stations that are broadcast to a gym. The mem bers of the gym must rate all the stations beforehand, and MusicFX plays one of the stations with the highest average rating. The system thus attempts to maximize the mean happiness of the group. One of its shortcomings is that users need to be able to rate all of the stations for MusicFX to pro duce good recommenda-tions, making it dicult to scale to a large num ber of musical choices. GroupCast [7] is a conceptually similar system that selects con ten t for a public displa y system. In this exam-ple, the user pro les needed to be too large for any user to complete. Without extensiv e pro les it was dicult to nd appropriate intersections of user preferences to put on the GroupCast displa ys. Instead, it displa yed con ten t that was interesting to one of the users, hoping that by chance others would have similar interests.

PolyLens [9] recommends movies to small groups of people who watch movies together. It applies a standard collab o-rativ e ltering algorithm to nd recommendations for eac h of the group mem bers, and then it com bines the results to mak e a group recommendation. Unlik e MusicFX, PolyLens attempts to satisfy all users to some degree, without nec-essarily maximizing the group average. PolyLens bases its recommendations on the exp ected happiness of the least sat-is ed group mem ber. Therefore, a movie that is barely ac-ceptable to eac h of the group mem bers is recommended over one that one person would hate but every one else would en-joy immensely .
A system that uses negativ e preferences acts like a lter that blo cks items that the user does not want and allo ws everything else to pass through. Suc h a system can initially assume that all solutions are acceptable and the user must notify it when an undesirable solution is encoun tered. From then on, the system will censor this undesirable solution for the user. It gradually learns a user's preferences as he or she pro vides negativ e feedbac k over time. Eventually , the information lter will allo w only desirable items to reac h the user. Users do not need prior kno wledge of the solutions| they simply need to kno w what they don't like. In con trast, a positiv e preference scheme that keeps trac k of what the user wants usually requires that user preferences be deter-mined beforehand. User pro ling is tedious and the resulting pro les are usually incomplete due to the impatience or for-getfulness of the users. Negativ e preference applications do not require explicit user pro ling pro cesses|the users can train it by expressing dissatisfaction with its output.
A negativ e preference system would not be practical if a user needed to reject every undesirable item explicitly . An essen tial comp onen t is a distance or similarit y measure between data items. When a user rejects a candidate, it can be assumed that the user would dislik e similar candidates as well. Thus, rejecting one data item e ectiv ely censors a set of similar ones. This similarit y metric migh t be dicult to implemen t in practice, esp ecially when the domain is as sub jectiv e as music.

A ma jor bene t of using negativ e preferences is the ease with whic h user preferences of multiple individuals can be com bined. One simply tak es the union of the negativ e pref-erences of the individuals to nd the group's preferences. This com bined preference set will lter out items that are dislik ed by any of the group mem bers. We call the remaining solutions consensus solutions because they have been implic-itly appro ved by every one. Although this is formally equiv-alen t to nding the intersection of the positiv e preferences of the same group, it can be more e ectiv e in practice. Be-cause kno wledge of user preferences, positiv e or negativ e, is typically incomplete, a positiv e preferences scheme is likely to underestimate the num ber of solutions a user would toler-ate while the negativ e scheme would overestimate this value. Because the intersections of multiple users' preferences can be hard to nd, if they exist at all (a problem encoun tered by GroupCast dev elop ers [7]), it is preferable to err on the side of overestimating rather than underestimating the space of acceptable solutions.

Negativ e preference systems migh t enhance the in uence of group mem bers who hold minorit y opinions. In group de-cision making, social in uence can pressure people to change their expressed views. These in uences can be normativ e (the desire to conform) or informational (learning from oth-ers to inform one's own judgemen t) [4]. The negativ e prefer-ence approac h can reduce the normativ e pro cesses that sup-press minorit y opinions by requiring that the group reac hes consensus, whic h migh t alleviate the need for the minorit y to accept the ma jorit y opinion [1], and by making the decision-making pro cess anon ymous, whic h reduces the social pres-sures exerted by the ma jorit y. In addition to enhancing minorit y opinions, this feature of negativ e preferences could be applied to other priv acy-preserving situations. Negativ e preference systems implicitly favor informational in uences, whic h can increase the in uence of the minorit y [8]. Exp e-rienced group mem bers with the largest negativ e preference pro les exert the most con trol over the group decision by censoring more of the decision space. Therefore, kno wledge-able mem bers holding a minorit y opinion have the opp ortu-nity to con vert mem bers of the ma jorit y to their side.
We believ e that the use of negativ e preferences can be extended to other domains [3]. Tasks that require cater-ing to the desires of multiple individuals could bene t from this approac h. For example, intelligen t environmen ts that dynamically change the con ten ts of displa ys based on who is observing them could use negativ e preferences. Negativ e preference systems could also be used as an aid to creativ-ity. A designer could brainstorm by viewing random design candidates ltered using his or her set of negativ e prefer-ences [2]. Initially , a large num ber of unacceptable candi-dates would be presen ted, but as the designer trains the system it would presen t a wide range of acceptable candi-dates. Collab orating designers could use the same technique by com bining their sets of negativ e preferences. Only solu-tions that are acceptable to all would be likely to surviv e the ltering by the designers' preferences.
Adaptiv e Radio (http://www.cs.unm.edu/ dlchao/radio) is a music serv er that broadcasts to a group of people. It chooses its song selections from MP3s con tributed by users of the system. Adaptiv e Radio streams music to users' per-sonal computers using Icecast (http://www.icecast.org), but users must log on if they want their preferences to in uence the choice of songs. It has a simple web-based interface (Fig-ure 1). After logging on, the user can indicate that he or she does not like the curren tly playing song by pushing the \censor" button, whic h causes the Adaptiv e Radio serv er to remem ber not to play this song or similar ones in this user's presence again. Pressing the \skip" button causes the serv er to stop playing the curren t song and to randomly choose another. This function is intended to be used when there is only one listener or when it is obvious that every one in the room dislik es the song. Having separate censor and skip functions allo ws users to register dislik e for a song with-out interrupting the ow of music or to quic kly surv ey the musical choices (channel-surf ) without registering dislik e.
Adaptiv e Radio constructs musical preference pro les for eac h person using only the list of songs that are dislik ed by the users, implicitly assuming that unrated songs are ac-ceptable until pro ven otherwise. If instead one played songs that users already kno w that they like, unfamiliar music and music that has recen tly been added to the system would be unrated, and therefore unused by the system. By includ-ing unfamiliar music and songs that are not preferred but still acceptable to users, Adaptiv e Radio can select from a much larger set of songs. It avoids playing songs similar to those that have been rejected by any of the users who are curren tly listening, resulting in a song playlist that should please all users. If there is only one listener, the system will play music that this person likes. As more people arriv e, the selection of music will narro w to accommo date the listening preferences of the new users. In e ect, all users can veto song selections.

Because it is dicult to determine automatically the sim-ilarit y between songs, Adaptiv e Radio assumes that only songs on the same album are similar to eac h other. There-fore, if a user rejects a song, the rest of the album is censored as well. This crude similarit y measure seems to work well in practice, but collab orativ e ltering techniques could be used to create a more accurate metric.
We evaluated Adaptiv e Radio by making informal obser-vations of its use, examining users' Adaptiv e Radio music pro les, and giving users a short surv ey a few mon ths after it was installed in our oce. The surv ey results indicate that users were happ y with the performance of Adaptiv e Radio. Prior to its installation, music was rarely played in the of-ce. This was due in part to the fear of bothering cowork ers with one's own music. The participation of all oce mem-bers in the musical selection alleviated this concern. Users quic kly became comfortable with the user interface, whic h allo ws them to reject songs with little conscious e ort. Reg-istering disappro val became a nearly automatic reaction to undesirable music, as evidenced by the channel-sur ng be-havior during whic h a user would quic kly reject sev eral con-secutiv e songs without interrupting his or her work. When Adaptiv e Radio is playing desirable music, the listener does not need to think about the system. When undesirable mu-sic intrudes upon a listener's consciousness, he or she can quic kly register disappro val. Had our system used positiv e preferences, it would have required users to pro vide feedbac k during desirable songs.

According to our surv ey, Adaptiv e Radio introduced some users to music with whic h they were not previously familiar but now appreciate. Some users who had seemingly dif-feren t musical tastes disco vered that they enjo yed the mu-sic of their cowork ers. These serendipitous newfound musi-cal connections would be dicult to disco ver using a pos-itiv e preference approac h like MusicFX's, whic h preferen-tially plays what the listeners already kno w they like. Other users with little obvious overlap in musical tastes have no-ticed that Adaptiv e Radio often plays Simon and Garfunk el songs when they are in the room together. We soon real-ized that fast or loud songs are prone to rejection by people trying to work, whic h was con rmed in our surv ey results.
We examined the Adaptiv e Radio pro les of the four most regular users. Eac h of these users explicitly rejected between 45 and 117 songs, and their com bined pro les censored 1498 out of 1862 songs in the system, or 80%. Most of the al-bums that were not rejected by anyone were folk (including Simon and Garfunk el) and jazz, while albums from louder and faster genres like funk and electronic dance music were consisten tly rejected. The surv ey indicated that people gen-erally agreed on what they did not want to listen to at work (fast or hard music), but they did not agree on the types of music they would like to hear. Therefore, a positiv e prefer-ences scheme that queries users for their musical preferences would have had found it dicult to nd an intersection of all the individual user preferences.

The songs that are least likely to be rejected are slow, quiet, and familiar, and the music tended to be ino en-sive and bland, perhaps not much di eren t than the Muzak played in a typical workplace. Our passive musical prefer-ences can be quite di eren t from our active ones. While we migh t enjo y dynamic and challenging music in a concert setting, at work we often prefer something less intrusiv e. Bac kground music that calls atten tion to itself could be dis-tracting. In a workplace with broadcast music, everyone must be accommo dated, even if compromising seems unsat-isfactory to the ma jorit y. Adaptiv e Radio in the oce tends to play bland music, but it tailors its selections to curren t occupan ts. The users are likely to appreciate the fact that they have con trol over the music being broadcast [6]. If they happ en to share musical tastes, the variet y of accept-able music can be large; if not, the range is likely to be small and possibly unsatisfactory .

We explored the relationship between the num ber of users presen t and the num ber of songs that Adaptiv e Radio could play to them. As men tioned earlier, when the four most reg-ular users were presen t, the system would censor 80% of the songs. When only one of these users was presen t, it would censor between 27% and 52% of songs, dep ending on the user. For two users, we computed the percen tage of songs Adaptiv e Radio would censor for all possible pairs of these four users and averaged the results, and for three users we did the same for all possible subsets of three users. The results are sho wn in Figure 2. The percen tage of songs cen-sored rises rapidly with the num ber of users. For one and two users, the num ber of songs censored is hea vily dep en-den t on the particular users involved, as indicated by the large di erence between the minim um and maxim um val-ues in Figure 2. However, with three users, the minim um and maxim um percen tages of songs censored con verges, in-dicating that no matter whic h three users are presen t, the song selection will be similar. Adding a fourth user does % songs censored Figure 2: The relationship between the number of users and the percen tage of songs Adaptiv e Radio must censor. The boxes represen t the mean per-centage of songs that Adaptiv e Radio censors in the presence of a given number of users, and the bars indicate the minim um and maxim um values. not greatly increase the num ber of songs censored. In other words, the presence of only three users in our oce guaran-tees a narro w song selection for Adaptiv e Radio. Although reconciling the musical tastes of even a mo dest num ber of random individuals (perhaps as few as three!) can result in \lowest common denominator" music, Adaptiv e Radio migh t play a broader range of music in environmen ts where the num ber of people is small (suc h as the home or in a car) or where the musical preferences migh t be broader (e.g., in social settings or retail stores).

Adaptiv e Radio could also be used to create non-in tuitiv e groupings of individuals who share musical tastes, whic h would be useful when a limited num ber of broadcast chan-nels needs to accommo date a large num ber of listeners. Nor-mally , radio stations specialize in genres of music, and listen-ers must choose among them based on these predetermined categories of music. If Adaptiv e Radio were to partition the listeners automatically based on their preferences and cater to eac h group's collectiv e preferences, it could gener-ate novel playlists that cross established genre boundaries. For example, one could use a greedy algorithm to assign users to groups in suc h a way that maximizes the overlap of musical dislik es within the groups. The broadcaster could then choose music for eac h group that would re ect the pref-erences that the listeners in eac h have in common.
We introduced the use of negativ e preferences to help groups nd consensus solutions satisfactory to all individ-uals, and we dev elop ed an application, Adaptiv e Radio, to illustrate their use. Adaptiv e Radio's use of negativ e pref-erences expanded the set of songs that could be played to a group and pro vided a natural way to com bine user prefer-ences. By requiring feedbac k only when the user is dissat-is ed with its performance, using Adaptiv e Radio does not distract users from their work. Our results suggest that the system will play bland music in the workplace once there are three or more people presen t, but this may be the in-evitable result of consensus and of the nature of the oce environmen t. We believ e that in other environmen ts, Adap-tive Radio will choose more \interesting" music and could be an e ectiv e mediator of di ering musical tastes.
The use of negativ e preferences can easily be applied to other tasks, suc h as information ltering, intelligen t environ-men ts, and collab orativ e design. Group-mediated solutions will become essen tial as computers migrate from our desk-tops to our daily lives in the form of intelligen t environmen ts and ubiquitous computing applications. Most researc h in these areas emphasizes the preferences of a single individual, but for man y environmen ts it will be imp ortan t to satisfy multiple occupan ts sim ultaneously . Without an intelligen t means of reconciling individual preferences, these personal-ized technologies are likely to follo w the path of the Walk-man (personalized but antiso cial service) or Muzak (imp er-sonal and catering to the lowest common denominator).
