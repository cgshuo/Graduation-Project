 In this demo, we present iMecho, a context-aware desktop search system to help users get more relevant results. Differ-ent from other desktop search engines, iMecho ranks results not only by the content of the query, but also the context of the query. It employs an Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based user model, which is learned from user X  X  activity logs, to estimate the query context when he submits the query. The results from keyword search are re-ranked by their rel-evances to the context with acceptable overhead.

Searching personal data with keywords is becoming in-creasingly challenging as users create more and more per-sonal data, e.g., large amounts of local files, emails or cached web pages in their PCs. Current desktop search systems such as Google Desktop only support keyword searches that rank results by their relevance to the query. One problem with keyword search is that the result set usually contains many unrelated documents. To solve it, we need to find out what the user really needs besides using keywords.
In most cases of desktop search, the user is more interested in documents related to his context. By  X  context  X  we mean the user X  X  task when he submits the query. A task can be simply modeled as a set of documents accessed by the user for a specific purpose. A user constantly goes back to his previous tasks when he is using his PC. A user study [2] shows that about 40% tasks are re-opened by the user within a week. Another 23% tasks are re-opened within a month.
Following this observation, we develop a context-aware desktop search system called iMecho. The idea is to build a user behavior model based on the user X  X  previous activities. When he submits a query, the model estimates his hidden task, i.e., the context of the query, and then the system refines the ranking results accordingly with reasonable over-head. iMecho employs the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as the user model to estimate hidden tasks. In this model, a user keeps going from one task (a state of HMM) to another.
