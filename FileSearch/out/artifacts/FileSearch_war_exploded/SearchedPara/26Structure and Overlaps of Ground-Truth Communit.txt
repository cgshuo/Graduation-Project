 JAEWON YANG and JURE LESKOVEC , Stanford University Nodes in networks organize into densely linked groups that are commonly referred to as network communities , clusters, or modules [Fortunato 2010; Papadopoulos et al. 2012]. Studying networks at the level of communities is very useful, as there are many reasons why social, information, and technological networks organize into communi-ties. For example, society is organized into groups, families, friendship circles, villages, and associations [Feld 1981; Simmel 1964]. On the World Wide Web, topically related pages may link more densely among themselves [Flake et al. 2000]. In metabolic net-works, a cluster of nodes may be related to functional units, such as pathways and cycles [Barab  X  asi and Oltvai 2004]. In protein-protein interaction networks, proteins having the same role or function tend to interact more frequently and thus form net-work communities [Nepusz et al. 2012]. In research collaboration networks, researchers belonging to a same scientific community work together more often [Backstrom et al. 2006; Lin et al. 2012; Newman and Girvan 2004; Sun et al. 2009].

Modeling network communities frames numerous research problems and high-impact applications. Communities in social networks can be harnessed to create  X  X ord of mouth X  effects and increase the effectiveness of advertising [Leskovec et al. 2007a]. Communities in online networks can be used to increase engagement and prolong user lifetime [Kairam et al. 2012]. In biological networks, community detection methods have the potential to help with new discoveries, as discovered communities may cor-respond to previously unknown functional units in cells [Colizza et al. 2005; Qi et al. 2005]. And in technological networks, communities can be used to identify bottlenecks and hidden structures [Colizza et al. 2006].

Even though modeling network communities is a fundamental problem, our understanding of networks at the level of network communities has been relatively limited [Fortunato and Barth  X  elemy 2007; Karrer et al. 2008; Leskovec et al. 2009; Radicchi et al. 2004]: There exists a large number of different definitions and models of network communities [Baumes et al. 2005; Fortunato 2010; Radicchi et al. 2004], and many formalizations of community detection lead to intractable NP-hard optimization problems [Leskovec et al. 2010; Schaeffer 2007]. Moreover, the lack of reliable ground-truth makes the evaluation of such models extremely difficult [Yang and Leskovec 2012b, 2013a].

Present Work. Here we study the connectivity structure of ground-truth communities in order to develop an accurate model for network community structure.

Our work starts with identifying a set of six different large social, collaboration, and information networks where we can reliably define a notion of ground-truth communi-ties [Yang and Leskovec 2012b, 2013a]. In all our networks, nodes explicitly state their ground-truth community memberships. Networks we study come from a number of dif-ferent domains and research areas. The size of the networks ranges from hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of nodes and edges. The networks represent a wide range of edge densities, numbers of ground-truth communities, as well as sizes and amounts of community overlap. The availability of reliable ground-truth communities has a profound effect. It allows us to quantify the connectivity structure of ground-truth communities and build better models of how nodes organize into communities.
In particular, we study how ground-truth communities of nodes connect inside the community, how they connect to the rest of the network, and how communities overlap and interact. This way, we can empirically study on a large scale how real communities map on the underlying network structure.

We show the following for a broad range of networks across diverse domains: First, communities in networks contain high-degree connector nodes that have an edge to most of the community members. Second, the nodes residing in the overlaps of commu-nities are more densely connected than the nodes that reside in the non-overlapping parts of communities. We view the second of these findings as particularly surprising, as we show that it goes against the conventional wisdom that communities (both over-lapping and non-overlapping) are more densely connected than their boundaries or the overlaps themselves [Ahn et al. 2010; Palla et al. 2005]. Thus, rather than shedding light on the debate on whether and how much communities overlap in networks, our findings suggest the need to revisit standard models of community structure to account for the fact that nodes in the overlap of communities are more densely connected.
What underlying process causes community overlaps to be denser than the com-munities themselves? This question motivates the second main contribution of this work. We present a family of probabilistic generative models for graphs that capture the observed phenomena and produce graphs with realistic community structure. We build on models of affiliation networks [Baumes et al. 2004; Breiger 1974; Lattanzi and Sivakumar 2009] and develop the community-affiliation graph model (AGM) which re-liably reproduces the organization of networks into communities and the overlapping community structure. In the affiliation network, memberships of nodes to communi-ties are modeled with a bipartite graph, where on the  X  X eft X  we have the nodes of the underlying network, and on the  X  X ight X  are the nodes representing communities. The edges of this bipartite graph model node-community affiliations. The central idea in generating networks based on the affiliation network is that links among nodes stem from one or more common or shared community affiliations [Breiger 1974; Feld 1981].
In our AGM model network communities arise due to shared group affiliations of nodes [Breiger 1974; Feld 1981; Simmel 1964]. We build on the focus theory of social ties [Feld 1981] which recognized that edges in social networks form around shared social foci of individuals. This means that links of the network often exist as a result of one dominant reason (people are in the same family, work together, or share common hobbies and interests). In AGM, we capture this by modeling the probability of an edge between a pair of nodes as a function of the communities that the two nodes share and the edges of the network then arise due to shared node community memberships. Community assignments in AGM are probabilistic, which allows for flexibility in the structure of community overlaps. We mathematically analyze the AGM and obtain rigorous results showing that the model leads to community structure and overlaps as observed in real data. Experiments on a range of network datasets establish that the AGM reliably captures node community memberships, internal structure of the groups, and generates realistic group overlaps.

To sum up, our work has two main contributions.  X  X e make a novel empirical observation that nodes in the community overlaps are more densely connected than the nodes in the non-overlapping parts of communities.  X  X e show that most present models and methods for network community detection make an implicit assumption that the nodes in community overlaps are less densely connected than in the non-overlapping parts of communities.  X  X e develop the community-affiliation graph model that explains the emergence of dense community overlaps and accurately models the global network community structure.

Our results have implications in several contexts.  X  Design of new community detection methods. As we show in this article, nearly all community detection methods assume sparse community overlaps [Ahn et al. 2010;
Airoldi et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2010; Palla et al. 2005]. This means that these methods cannot properly detect communities in large networks X  X hey would either mistak-enly identify the overlap as a separate community or merge two overlapping commu-nities into a single community. Thus, our findings have important implications for the development of new network community detection methods [Yang and Leskovec 2012a, 2013b].  X  Synthetic benchmarks. Our model can be used to generate synthetic benchmark datasets for evaluation and analysis of network community detection methods.  X  Graph generation . Our findings form means for assessing the quality of graph gen-erators. Synthetic graphs are important for  X  X hat if X  scenarios, for extrapolations, and for simulations, where real graphs are impossible to collect (e.g., a very large friendship graph between people).  X  Anomaly detection. In many network settings,  X  X ormal X  communities will produce overlaps that obey our observations. If we detect communities producing structures that deviate significantly from this, we can flag them as an abnormality; this can potentially help with the detection of fraud and spam.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we survey the related work. In Section 3, we describe the network data and the ground-truth communi-ties [Yang and Leskovec 2012b, 2013a]. Section 4 presents our empirical observation that overlaps are more densely connected than individual communities. Section 7 dis-cusses implications of our observation for models of network community structure. In Section 5, we develop the community-affiliation graph model (AGM), a generative model for networks which can naturally generate dense overlap, and we show that our AGM generates realistic looking networks in Section 6. We conclude in Section 8. Last, we also note that the present article is an extended version of Yang and Leskovec [2012c, 2012a]. It is important to note the fundamental contrast between one of our main findings here X  X hat the community overlaps are denser than communities themselves X  X nd a massive body of work on network community detection [Airoldi et al. 2007; Clauset et al. 2004; Dhillon et al. 2007; Girvan and Newman 2002; Hopcroft et al. 2003; Karypis and Kumar 1998; McAuley and Leskovec 2012; Nadakuditi and Newman 2012; Palla et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2009; Tantipathananandh et al. 2007]. Community detection seeks to infer potential communities in a network based on the network connectivity structure (i.e., by using a particular structural definition of a network community) and then argues why those extracted structural communities correspond to real functional communities. On the other hand, our work here starts from the other end of the problem. We start with a network in which functional communities have already been explicitly labeled [Abrahao et al. 2012; Yang and Leskovec 2012b] and seek to model their connectivity structure. Thus, our work here is directly relevant for community detection, as it identifies connectivity structure of real communities and a presents a realistic model.

Our work seeks to develop a generative model for network communities. In terms of probabilistic models for graph generation, there has also been considerable work done. The discovery of degree power-laws and other properties of static and dynamic graphs led to the development of random graph models that exhibited such properties [Kumar et al. 2000; Lattanzi and Sivakumar 2009; Leskovec et al. 2007b; Watts and Strogatz 1998]. (See [Chakrabarti and Faloutsos 2006; Mitzenmacher 2004] for surveys of this area). The main difference to our work here is that our goals are more ambitious, as we aim to accurately model both the overall network structure as well as the node community memberships and the overlaps of communities.

Our community-affiliation graph model (AGM), which produces realistic graphs as well as community overlaps, is an example of a bipartite affiliation network model [Breiger 1974; Lattanzi and Sivakumar 2009; Seshadhri et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Zheleva et al. 2009]. Affiliation networks have been extensively studied in sociol-ogy [Breiger 1974] as a metaphor of classical social theory concerning the intersection of persons with groups, where it has been recognized that communities arise due to shared group affiliations [Breiger 1974; Simmel 1964]. In affiliation network models, nodes of the social network are affiliated with communities that they belong to, and the links of the underlying social network are derived based on the community affiliation network.

The most related to our model is the work of Lattanzi and Sivakumar [2009] who stud-ied the macroscopic evolution of networks and proposed an affiliation network model for modeling evolution of social networks. They proved that networks arising from the model exhibit power-law degree distributions, densification power law, and shrinking diameter. Our focus here is different, as we aim to accurately model static network community structure. To achive this, we extend the model of Lattanzi and Sivakumar [2009] in order to allow for modeling non-overlapping, hierarchically-nested, as well as overlapping community structures. This way, AGM acquires the necessary flexibility to accurately model the community structure of real-world networks. And last, the model in Lattanzi and Sivakumar [2009] cannot be fitted to the data and thus cannot be used for community detection. On the other hand, we can in fact perform community detec-tion by fitting the AGM to a given underlying network. We refer the reader to Yang and Leskovec [2012a, 2013b] for further details on how to perform community detection using AGM.

AGM is also related to the models for generating synthetic benchmarks for commu-nity detection [Karrer et al. 2008; Lancichinetti and Fortunato 2009]. Similar to AGM, these models, given community affiliations, generate synthetic networks, in which we can evaluate the accuracy of community detection methods. One of the most notable models is Lancichinetti and Fortunato [2009], which is commonly referred to as the LFR model. LFR can generate networks with a power-law degree distribution and over-lapping community structure. However, LFR assumes that the community overlaps are not denser than individual communities, whereas AGM assumes that community over-laps are denser. Our experiments in Section 4 show that, due to this difference, AGM generates more realistic networks than LFR. In the following section, we describe how we identified networks where nodes explicitly state their ground-truth community memberships [Yang and Leskovec 2012b, 2013a]. Here we give a brief reasoning about different notions of ground-truth communities and refer the reader to Yang and Leskovec [2013a] for a more detailed argument and description.

Networks that we study come from a variety of domains, and their size ranges from hundreds of thousand to hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges. In particu-lar, we consider a set of six large social, collaboration, and information networks, where for each network, we identify a graph and a robust definition of ground truth [Yang and Leskovec 2013a]. We identify networks where nodes explicitly state their ground-truth community memberships. Members of these ground-truth communities share properties or attributes, common purpose, or function. We did our best to identify net-works in which such ground-truth communities can be reliably defined and identified. Even though there is some inherent noise in the ground-truth labeling, our results are surprisingly robust and consistent across the wide range of networks we study. Online Social Networks. First we consider three online social networks (the Live-Journal blogging community [Backstrom et al. 2006], the Friendster online network [Mislove et al. 2007], and the Orkut social network [Mislove et al. 2007]) where users create explicit groups which other users then join. Such groups serve as organizing prin-ciples of nodes in social networks and are focused on specific topics, interests, hobbies, affiliations, and geographical regions. For example, LiveJournal categorizes commu-nities into the following types: culture, entertainment, expression, fandom, life/style, life/support, gaming, sports, student life, and technology. Overall, there are over three hundred thousand explicitly defined communities in LiveJournal. Similarly, users in Friendster as well as in Orkut define topic-based communities that others then join. Both networks have more than a million explicitly defined groups, and each user can join to one or more such groups. We consider each group a ground-truth community.
Information Networks. The second type of network data we consider is the Amazon product co-purchasing network [Leskovec et al. 2007a]. The nodes of the network rep-resent products and edges link commonly co-purchased products. Each product (i.e., node) belongs to one or more hierarchically organized product categories, and products from the same category define a group which we view as a ground-truth community. This means members of the same community share a common function or role, and each level of the product hierarchy defines a set of hierarchically nested and overlapping communities.

Collaboration Networks. Finally, we also consider collaboration networks of DBLP and IMDB [Backstrom et al. 2006] where nodes represent authors/actors and edges connect nodes that have co-authored a paper/co-appeared in the movie. To define ground truth in DBLP, we proceed as follows. Communities in a scientific domain correspond to people working in common areas and subareas of science, and publication venues serve as good proxies for scientific areas: people publishing in the same conference or journal tend to work in a common area. Thus we use publication venues as ground-truth communities which serve as proxies for highly-overlapping scientific communities around which the collaboration network then organizes. Following similar reasoning, we found that, in IMDB, language is a good way of defining ground-truth communities among actors. Next we briefly describe the properties of ground-truth communities. We refer the reader to Yang and Leskovec [2013a] for a more detailed discussion of general properties of ground-truth communities.

Table I gives the dataset statistics. We observe that the size of networks ranges between hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges. The number of ground-truth communities varies from hundreds to millions, and there is also a nice range in group sizes and the node membership distribution. Moreover, Figure 1 gives the distributions of community sizes, and Figure 2 shows the distribution (Complementary CDF) of the number of community memberships that a node belongs to. Notice heavy-tailed distributions of ground-truth community sizes as well as the number of community memberships of a node.

Overall, for each of the networks, we identified a sensible way of defining ground-truth communities that serve as organizational units of these networks. Note that we are careful to define ground-truth communities based on common affiliation, social circle, role, activity, interest, function, or some other property around which networks organize into communities [Feld 1981; Granovetter 1973]. Even though our networks come from very different domains and have very different motivation for formation of communities, the results we present here are consistent and robust. Our work is consistent with the premise that is implicit in all network community literature: mem-bers of real communities share some (latent/unobserved) property or affiliation that serves as an organizing principle of the nodes and makes them well-connected in the network. Here we use these groups around which communities organize to explicitly define ground truth. And, as we will later see, the ground-truth communities exhibit connectivity patterns that match our intuition of communities as densely connected sets of nodes. In fact, recently we also quantitatively showed that the ground-truth communities match well the notion of structural communities because they possess many desirable structural properties. For example, our ground-truth communities have 40% higher edge density than a set of connected nodes which are chosen randomly from the same network [Yang and Leskovec 2013a].

All our networks and the corresponding ground-truth data are complete and publicly available at http://snap.stanford.edu . We represent all networks by considering each network as an unweighted undirected static graph. We note that using undirected networks is a common practice when studying network community structure [Abrahao et al. 2012; Ahn et al. 2010; Palla et al. 2005; Sawardecker et al. 2009]. Moreover, because members of the ground-truth community may be disconnected in the network, we consider each connected component of the group as a separate ground-truth community. However, we allow ground-truth communities to be nested and to overlap (i.e., a node can be a member of multiple groups at once). Last, we note that we focus on analyzing 5,000 cohesively connected communities in each dataset, as we did in our previous work [Yang and Leskovec 2012b]. However, we observe qualitatively similar results when analyzing all ground-truth communities as well. We now proceed to discuss our empirical findings that motivate the model we later develop. We focus our analyses on two aspects of connectivity structure of ground-truth communities: First, we investigate the connectivity properties of communities, that is, we study the structure of induced graphs on the set of community members S . Second, we study connectivity patterns of community overlaps and investigate the amount of edge clustering in the overlap versus the clustering in the non-overlapping parts of the community. We first examine the relation between the size of the community (i.e., | S | )andthe number of edges between the nodes of the community ( E S ={ ( u ,v ) | u ,v  X  S , ( u ,v )  X  E ) } ). Figure 3(a) shows the relation. Interestingly, across the range of datasets, we consistently observe a form of the Densification Power Law [Leskovec et al. 2005] where the number of edges in the community increases superlinearly with the community size, | E Friendster) have densification exponent  X   X  1 . 5. We also note a similar exponent for IMDB. On the other hand, DBLP and Amazon have lower values of  X   X  1 . 1.

This is interesting, as we would expect that small groups are tightly knit and thus the average degree in these groups is high as everyone  X  X nows X  everyone else. On the other hand, we would also expect larger groups to be relatively sparsely connected, as they are too big for their members to keep track of everyone else. Interestingly, the observed phenomena is somewhere in between. Even though the absolute number of one X  X  friends that are in the community increases with the size of the community (i.e., the number of edges increases superlinearly with the number of nodes), the fraction of community members whom one is friends with (i.e., density of the community) decreases with the community size (since  X &lt; 2). Thus, in larger communities, a node is connected to overall more of the community X  X  members, while they are also connected to a smaller fraction of community X  X  members as the community size grows.

The distinction between small and large communities becomes even clearer once we examine the existence of a connector/hub node in the community. To investigate the existence of a connector node, we first define the internal degree (ID) d in ( u , S )of node u in a community S to be the number of members of S to which u is connected, d ( u , S ) =|{ v | v  X  S , ( u ,v )  X  E S }| . Then we define the maximal internal community degree fraction (ICDF) f in ( S )ofcommunity S to be the maximal fraction of community example, a maximal ICDF of 0.7 of community S means that there exists a node u  X  S that is connected to 70% of all of the members of S .

Figure 3(b) plots the average maximal ICDF as a function of community size. We observe that in communities smaller than  X  100 nodes, there exist connector nodes that link to more than 80% of all the community members. However, as the community size increases beyond 100, the maximal ICDF tends to quickly decrease. This result is interesting, as it suggests that smaller communities tend to organize themselves around connector node(s), while in larger communities, connector nodes do not exist. There are two exceptions to this result, both of which can be nicely explained. Amazon is a product co-purchasing network, and thus there is no internal reason why such con-nector nodes should exist. And the presence of a connector node in the DBLP network would suggest existence of special publication venues where the connector node would co-author all the papers, which again is not realistic. Communities in networks form overlaps when there exist nodes that belong to multiple communities. Figure 4 illustrates the setting of two communities A and B , and nodes that belong to both communities reside in the overlap O . We study the structure of group overlap by simply asking what is the probability that a pair of nodes is connected if they share k common community memberships, that is, the nodes belong to the overlap of k communities. Figure 5 plots this probability (the red  X  X ata X  curve) for all six datasets. The figure also plots (the green  X  X GM X  curve), the same quantity as modeled by our community-affiliation graph model that we will describe in the next section.
First, notice that all curves are generally increasing. This means that the more communities a pair of nodes has in common, the higher the probability of an edge. In LiveJournal, for example, if a pair of nodes has eight communities in common, the probability of friendship is nearly 80%. To appreciate how strong the effect of shared communities is on the edge probability, one has to note that all our networks are extremely sparse. The background probability of a random pair of nodes being connected is  X  10  X  5 , while as soon as a pair of nodes shares two communities, their probability of linking increases by 4 orders of magnitude (from 10  X  5 to 10  X  1 ).
Such high edge probability in the overlap is not just the consequence of the fact that the overlapping nodes have high degrees. The overlapping nodes have high degrees in general because they form edges across multiple communities, but this high degree alone cannot explain such high edge probability. For example, the average degree of the nodes in the overlaps in LiveJournal is around 50. If we assume the edges are created according to the node degrees only (i.e., the configuration model [Molloy and Reed 1995]), the edge probability between two overlapping nodes is still extremely low (  X 
We note that all our datasets have similar shapes X  X he probability of a pair of nodes being connected approaches 1 as the number of shared communities increases. While in online social networks, the edge probability exhibits a diminishing-returns-like growth, in other datasets (IMDB, DBLP, Amazon), it appears to follow a threshold-like behavior.
In retrospect, this result is very intuitive. For example, in the context of social networks, two students that belong to both a Tuesday salsa club and a Sunday movie club are more likely to meet each other than if they would belong to only a single club. Thus, the more communities nodes share, the more likely they are to meet and interact. Communities thus serve as organizing principles of nodes in social networks and are created on shared affiliation, role, activity, social circle, interest, or function.
What is perhaps more surprising is that we later show in Section 7 that most present overlapping community detection methods make an implicit assumption that is exactly the opposite. Most present methods and models of communities [Ahn et al. 2010; Airoldi et al. 2007; Sales-Pardo et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2009; Lancichinetti and Fortunato 2009; Lee et al. 2010; Psorakis et al. 2011; Palla et al. 2005; Evans and Lambiotte 2009] implicitly assume that nodes in community overlaps are less densely connected than nodes in the non-overlapping parts of communities. This assumption is prevalent in present approaches. This assumption further implies that pairs of nodes that share two or more communities have a lower probability of being connected. So, given that edge probability increases with the number of overlapping communities, this means that most present overlapping community detection methods are not able to correctly identify community overlaps X  X hey either confuse the overlap as a separate community or identify multiple overlapping communities as a single one. We give further details in Section 7. We further analyze how connectivity patterns of nodes in the overlap differ from node connectivity patterns in the non-overlapping part of the community. We conduct the following experiment. For every node u in the overlap O , we first identify which of u  X  X  neighbors belong to only A (but not B ), only B (but not A ), and which to the overlap O . Let X  X  denote these sets of nodes as A u , B u and O u . We then compute XY ( u ) which denotes For example, OO ( u ) denotes the fraction of edges that are present among u  X  X  neighbors that are all in the overlap. In other words, OO ( u ) is the clustering coefficient [Watts and Strogatz 1998] of the overlap. Similarly, AB ( u ) is the  X  X ross-community X  clustering, where one neighbor of u is in A u and the other in B u . AABB ( u ) is the  X  X n-community X  clustering, the fraction of the connected pairs of nodes x , y which belong together to either A ( x  X  A , y  X  A )orto B ( x  X  B , y  X  B ). For example, in Figure 4, all the neighbors of u that are in O are connected with each other so OO ( u ) = 1, Whereas, two out of three pairs of nodes in A are connected, and there are no connections between AB ( u ) = 0.
 Figure 6 plots average OO ( u ), AABB ( u ), and AB ( u ) as a function of the degree of u . We observe that the nodes in the community overlap are more densely connected than the nodes that only belong to a single community, as OO ( u ) is generally higher than AABB ( u ). AB ( u ) exhibits lower values than either AABB ( u )and OO ( u ), which suggests that nodes that belong to different communities are less likely to form connections. Notice similar behavior for all six datasets, where connections are most likely to be formed if the nodes belong to the overlap (red curve), less likely if they both belong to the same community (green curve), and least likely if the pair of nodes belongs to different communities (blue curve). The next question we investigate is whether the connector node (i.e., the node that is connected to the most other members of a community) belongs to the overlap. We extract all pairs of communities ( A , B ) that have non-empty overlap O , and then compute the probability that the connector of community A is in the overlap O . Figure 7 shows this probability as a function of the fraction of nodes in the community overlap ( | O | / | A | ). If the connector node would be a random node in a community, then the probability of a connector node belonging to the overlap is equal to the fraction of the nodes in the overlap, that is, the probability of connector being in O is | O | / | A | . However, we find that the probability of connector being in the overlap increases super-linearly with the size of the overlap in all the datasets. This demonstrates that connector nodes tend to reside in group overlaps and are not central to a single community.

Based on all these results, we conclude that the dense community overlaps in our study reflect a fundamental property of the underlying networks. Understanding the possible causes for this property will be the subject of the next section. Given the phenomena we observed and the fact that most present notions and models of network communities make exactly the opposite assumption (see Section 7), we now present a simple, conceptual model of behavior, which naturally leads to the phenomena that we have observed.

We build on Breiger X  X  foundational work [Breiger 1974], where it has been recognized that communities in networks arise due to shared group affiliations [Breiger 1974; Simmel 1964]. Furthermore, we build on the focus theory of social ties [Feld 1981] which explained tie formation in social networks as a result of shared social foci between the individuals. Building on these sociological theories, we present the community-affiliation graph model (AGM), a family of simple probabilistic generative models for graphs that capture the phenomena observed in Section 4 and reliably reproduce the organization of networks into communities and the overlapping community structure. The main ingredient we aim to model is the increasing probability of linking, as nodes are more and more common communities. We can thus think of a pair of people that are members of several different interest-based communities. Then, by having more interests in common, they are more likely to meet and connect.

Our model is based on two main ingredients. The first ingredient is a bipartite affil-iation network that links nodes of the social network to communities that they belong to. The second ingredient is the insight that each community also carries a single pa-rameter that captures the probability that nodes belonging to that community to share a link. Thus, the more communities a pair of nodes shares, the higher the probability of linking. Figure 8 illustrates the essence of our model. We start with a bipartite graph where the nodes at the bottom represent the nodes of the network and the nodes on the top represent communities. The edges between nodes of the network and the commu-nities indicate community memberships. We denote the bipartite affiliation network as B ( V , C , M ), where V denotes the set of nodes of the original network G , C is a set of communities, and there is an edge ( u , c )  X  M from node u  X  V to community c  X  C if node u belongs to community c .

Now, given the affiliation network B ( V , C , M ), we want to generate a social network graph G ( V , E ). To achieve this, we need to specify the process which generates the edges E of G given the affiliation network B . We consider a simple parametrization where we assign a separte parameter p c to each community c  X  C . Parameter p c models the probability of an edge between two members of community c .Inother words, we simply generate an edge between a pair of nodes that belong to community c with probability p c . If nodes do not share any communities, we assume they link with a small probability  X  . Each community c creates edges independently. However, if the two nodes have already been connected via some other common community membership, then the duplicate edge is not included in the graph G ( V , E ).

Definition 5.1 . Let B ( V , C , M ) be a bipartite graph where V is a set of nodes, C is a set of communities, and an edge ( u , c )  X  M connects node u  X  V to community c  X  C if u belongs to community c . Also, let { p Given affiliation network B ( V , C , M )and { p c } , the community-affiliation graph model generates a graph G ( V , E ) with the node set V and the edge set E as follows. For each pair of nodes u ,v  X  V , the AGM creates edge ( u ,v )  X  E with probability p ( u ,v ): and  X  is the edge probability when u and v do not share any communities.

Note that this simple process already ensures that pairs of nodes that belong to multiple common communities are more likely to link. This is due to the fact that nodes that share multiple community memberships get multiple chances to create a link. For example, pairs of nodes in the overlap of communities A and B in Figure 8 get two chances to create an edge. First they can get connected with probability p A (due to their membership in community A ) and then also with probability p B (due to membership in B ). While pairs of nodes residing in the non-overlapping region of A link with probability p which already ensures that overlaps of communities are more densely connected than the non-overlapping parts.

Last, we also point out the flexible nature of the community-affiliation graph model, which allows for modeling a wide range of network community structures. The flexibility of the affiliation network structure allows for modeling non-overlapping, hierarchically-nested, as well as overlapping communities. Figure 9 shows examples of community structure and the corresponding AGM models. Properties of the netoworks arising from AGM can also mathematically analyzed. We derive several properties of the AGM networks that match the observations from Section 4. The aim of the analysis is to provide simple analytical results that illustrate that the AGM naturally obeys the empirical observations.

P ROPOSITION 5.3. The fraction of connected neighbors in the overlap of two commu-nities is higher than in the non-overlapping part of a single community (observation in Figure 6).

P ROOF .Let A , B be two overlapping communities with an overlap O and p A , p B be the probabilities with which the AGM connects the nodes in A , B . The fraction of connected neighbors in a region (overlap or a single community) is identical to the edge probability between neighbors in the region. Therefore, the neighbors in a non-overlapping part of either A or B are connected with probability p A or p B , and neighbors in the overlap are connected with probability p A + p B  X  p A p B .Noticethat p A + p B  X  p A p B  X  p A and p
P ROPOSITION 5.4. Given communities A , B and their overlap O, the probability that the connector node (i.e., the node that is connected to most other members of a community) of A is in overlap O is higher than | O | / | A | (observation in Figure 7).
P ROOF . AGM generates edges among the nodes in community A (node set n A ) inde-pendently with probability p A ( G n with prob. p B ( G n of A . The probability of the connector node being in O is the sum of X o for each o  X  O , o  X  O p ( X o ), which is internal degree of o and A , d in ( o , A ), is the maximal among d in ( u , A )ofall u  X  A . Consider how o can be connected to other nodes in A ; o is connected to other nodes in A by G n let E B be the number of connections that G n O . Then, it follows that d ( u , A )ofanyother u  X  A when E B = 0. However, by the same reasoning, we also see
P ROPOSITION 5.5. If p c = p for all communities c, the conditional edge probability between two nodes is an increasing function of the number of communities that the both nodes belong to (observation in Figure 5).

P ROOF . When two nodes belong to k common communities, the AGM connects the two nodes with probability 1  X  (1  X  p ) k , which is an increasing function of k . Having defined the AGM, we now proceed to investigate its properties. We perform a set of simulation experiments and compare our model to other models of network com-munity structure. For each network, we generate a synthetic network with the AGM, and then compare the synthetic network and the synthetic community structure to the structure of the real network. For a comparison, we use the model of network commu-nity structure proposed by Lancichinetti and Fortunato [2009]. We refer to the model as the LFR. The LFR model is the state-of-the-art model for generating networks with overlapping community structure that can then be used for evaluating community de-tection methods. Our goal is to understand whether the AGM qualitatively reproduces structural properties of real networks, real communities, and real community overlaps. In order to compare real networks to the synthetic networks generated by the AGM and LFR, we need to set parameters of both models. Both the AGM and the LFR re-quire bipartite affiliation networks, and for simplicity, we construct the community affiliation network from the node community membership information. Then, we use maximum likelihood estimation to fit the parameters of the LFR as well as the AGM. For AGM, we fit a set of probabilities { p c } . (We discuss the fitting of { p c } via convex optimization in the following section.) The LFR requires the following parameters: the power-law coefficient of the network degree distribution and the fraction of external edges of each node. We estimate these parameters from the real network using maxi-mum likelihood estimation. Note that when computing the community internal degree of a node, LFR penalizes nodes in the overlap: the internal degree is inversely propor-tional to the number of communities that the node belongs to, which means that LFR also assumes sparse community overlaps. In other words, in LFR, the probability of a pair of nodes being connected in practice descreases with the increasing number of shared communities.
 We then compare the networks synthesized by the two models to the real networks. We investigate three criteria: structure of communities, structure of community over-laps, and structure of the networks themselves. For each of the six datasets, we repeat the measurements from Section 4 on real and on synthetic networks and examine the performance of the two models. Given a graph G ( V , E ) and a bipartite community affiliation network B ( V , C , M ), we aim to find parameters { p c } that maximize the likelihood of observed edges in G :
By applying Eq. (1), we transform the optimization problem to with constraints 0  X  p c  X  1.

This optimization is nontrivial to solve. The objective function is nonconvex, as it involves a product over the variables p k . Now, we show that it can be converted to a convex optimization problem.

We maximize the logarithm of the likelihood and perform a change of variables 1  X  p and constraints 0  X  p c  X  1 become x c  X  0. This transformed problem is a convex function of { x c } , and thus the globally optimal values of { x c } can be efficiently found. Then, by the change of variables, we find the values of { p c } .

By extending this estimation procedure, we can use AGM for community detection , that is, we can also search for the optimal community affiliation B ( V , C , M )aswell as { p c } so that the probability of G is maximized. As a follow up work, we developed an AGM-based community detection method where we find B ( V , C , M )aswellas { p c } via maximum likelihood estimation. The method can successfully detect ground-truth communities on a range of networks [Yang and Leskovec 2012a, 2013b]. First, we compare connectivity patterns of communities in the synthetic networks to those of the the ground-truth communities. We perform measurements analogous to those in Section 4 and plot the results in Figures 10 and 11. For each network, we overlay the original results from the ground-truth communities (Figure 3) with the properties of communities in the synthetic AGM and LFR networks.

Overall, we observe that the AGM much better captures connectivity patterns of communities. For example, in Figure 10, we plot the number of edges inside the com-munity and observe a version of the Densification Power Law [Leskovec et al. 2005]. Notice that AGM almost perfectly captures the pattern. Similarly, we observed that in social networks, communities tend to have connector nodes when the community size is smaller than 100 nodes. Figure 11 gives the plots. Again, AGM is able to capture this property of ground-truth communities. Nodes that belong to multiple communities thus reside in the overlap of mutiple com-munities. In Section 4, we observed that these multi-community nodes have higher connectivity than the nodes that belong only to a single community. We also noted that an overlap is likely to contain the connector node of the group, and the overlap becomes denser as more groups join the overlap. We examine how well the two models mimic these patterns of group overlaps.

Edge Probability as a Function of the Number of Shared Communities. First, we found that the edge probability between a pair of nodes is an increasing function of the number of communities that the nodes share. Figure 12 plots the edge probability as a function of the number of common communities between a pair of nodes for each real network and compares it to the two models. Notice that the AGM successfully reproduces the edge probability, while LFR fails to model the fact that nodes that share more communities are more likely to be connected. Notice that the AGM is able to capture a wide range of behaviors X  X rom diminishing-returns (Figure 12(a)), S-shape (Figure 12(s)) to a slowly rising pattern (Figure 12(f))
Edge Clustering in Community Overlaps. Second, we observed that the fraction of connected neighbors is higher inside the overlaps than inside a single community (Figure 6). To compare how well AGM and LFR reproduce such results, we plot the fraction of connected neighbors inside overlap measured in the real networks and the synthetic networks generated by AGM or LFR in Figure 13 ( X  X O X  curve in Figure 6). Note that AGM can generate a high fraction of connected neighbors inside the overlaps. Figure 14 displays the fraction of connected neighbors for the case where two neighbors belong to only one community ( X  X ABB X  curve in Figure 6). Again, we observe that the synthetic networks generated by AGM follows the pattern of real networks more closely than the synthetic networks by LFR.

The Connector Nodes Reside in the Community Overlap. Third, we also observed that real communities have a connector node, and the connector node is more likely to exist inside the overlap (Figure 7). We validate the presence of the connector node in synthetic communities in Figure 15. We compute the probability that the overlap O between two communities A and B has a connector node of either community A or B . Notice that AGM shows a very close fit to the real networks in every dataset. In contrast, in LFR, the probability of a connector being in the overlap is much lower, which confirms that the overlaps between LFR communities are less dense than a single community.

The result in Figure 15 is also interesting as it explains why communities in the AGM tend to have connector nodes (Figure 11). Since edges inside each AGM community are created independently (which by itself does not produce skewed node degrees), we would naturally expect that all the nodes would have similar degrees and no connector nodes would emerge. However, since the overlaps are dense, the nodes in the overlap tend to have higher degrees and emerge as connector nodes (as shown in Figure 11). The LFR explicitly forces a heavy-tailed degree distribution which makes a few nodes have very high degrees. However, LFR communities do not have a connector node. This is because LFR prevents the nodes in the overlaps from forming edges in a single com-munity, and thus the connector node links to a small fraction of community members. Overall Performance Comparison. We now quantify the overall performance of the AGM and the LFR. For each structural property, we measure the quality of fit be-tween that property in the synthetic AGM and LFR networks and the real data. We apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, which is a nonparametric way of quantifying the distance between two distribution functions. Given two distribution putes the maximum difference between the cumulative area under the two curves, curve (or the LFR curve) and the true curve for all the following properties.  X  VOL. Edges inside the community (Figure 10).  X  MID. Maximum internal community degree fraction (Figure 11).  X  EP. Edge probability between nodes (Figure 12).  X  PC. Probability of a connector residing in the overlap (Figure 15).  X  OO. Fraction of connected neighbors in the overlap (Figure 13).  X  AABB. Fraction of connected neighbors in a community (Figure 14).

Table II reports the relative improvement in the KS-statistic between the two models (the difference between the two models normalized by the larger value of the two). The value of the relative improvement can be between 1 (the AGM completely outperforms LFR) and  X  1 (LFR completely outperforms the AGM). The AGM shows a relative improvement of 60%, which means that the AGM outperforms LFR for about a factor of 2. Furthermore, the AGM shows significantly lower average KS-statistics in every property as well as on every network. Overall, we conclude that the AGM reliably captures the properties of real overlaps and real groups and significantly improves over previous state-of-the-art models. Last, we also study whether the AGM is able to generate overall realistic networks. We examine how well the global structural properties of the synthetic networks match the properties of the real network. For each of the networks synthesized by the AGM and LFR, we quantify the degree of agreement between the real and synthetic network by computing the KS-statistic on the following network properties.
  X  Degree distribution (Deg). Histogram of the number of edges of a node. Networks tend to have power-law degrees [Faloutsos et al. 1999].  X  Clustering coefficient (CCF). Distribution of clustering coefficient of nodes [Watts and
Strogatz 1998].  X  Hop plot (Hop). The number of reachable pairs of nodes in less than x hops [Leskovec et al. 2005].  X  Triad participation (TP). The number of triangles that a node participates in [Tsourakakis 2008].  X  Eigenvalues (EigVal). Distribution of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix [Chakrabarti and Faloutsos 2006; Farkas et al. 2001].  X  Eigenvector (EigVec). Distribution of components in the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue. It has been also known to be heavy tailed [Chakrabarti and Faloutsos 2006; Chakrabarti et al. 2004].
 Table III shows the relative improvements in KS-statistics of the AGM over LFR. The AGM network follows very closely the patterns of the real network for most properties, like the degree distribution, triad participation, and eigenvalues. The only exception where LFR outperforms the AGM is the eigenvector. The AGM exhibits 9% better fit (KS-statistic) than LFR for degree distribution, 221% for clustering coefficient, 7% for hop distribution, 120% for triad participation, and 122% for eigenvalues. Only for the eigenvector property does the LFR exhibits a 17% better value.

Overall, these results demonstrate that the AGM is not only able to reliably cap-ture the structure of network communities and community overlaps but that it also accurately generates the underlying networks.

In the Appendix, we further show Figures 20, 21, and 22. These figures plot the distributions of each of the network properties of synthetic networks and the real networks. We observe that synthetic networks generated by AGM closely follow the statistics of the real networks in most properties.

Figure 20 is particularly surprising, as it shows that AGM generates both heavy-tailed degree distribution and high clustering coefficient. As previously described, AGM generates the edges inside communities independently. If every node belongs to only one community (i.e., no community overlap), this process would generate homogeneous degree distribution and low clustering coefficient. However, since membership distribu-tion is heavy-tailed (Figure 2), there exist a considerable number of high-membership nodes. These high-membership nodes will also have high network degrees as they get multiple chances to create edges. This in turn results in a heavy-tailed degree distri-bution [Lattanzi and Sivakumar 2009].

A high clustering coefficient can be explained by the edges being generated by AGM will locally cluster in dense overlaps. In AGM, nodes in the same overlap (i.e., nodes who belong to multiple communities together) would have high probability of link-ing each other, and these nodes will have high clustering coefficients (as observed in Figure 6). Interestingly, the connection between community structure and high cluster-ing coefficient that we observe here is supported by recent theoretical advances [Gleich and Seshadhri 2012; Seshadhri et al. 2012]. Early works on community detection were heavily influenced by the strength of weak ties theory [Granovetter 1973] and built on the intuition that communities are non-overlapping sets of nodes that are internally well connected with a few connections to the rest of the network. Such intuition led to development of graph-partitioning approaches to community detection [Dhillon et al. 2007; Fiedler 1973; Guattery and Miller 1998; Kannan et al. 2004; Karypis and Kumar 1998; Shi and Malik 2000; Spielman and Teng 2007]. Refer to von Luxburg [2007] and Schaeffer [2007] for surveys of this area. Using similar intution, the methods using betweenness centrality and the notion modularity were also defined [Clauset et al. 2004; Newman 2006]. All these methods adopt the definition of communities, as depicted in Figure 16(a). Here we see two non-overlapping communities, both depicted as a network and also in the form of an adjacency matrix. Each community has many edges among its members and few edges pointing outside the community. If the network follows the community structure depicted in Figure 16(a), then the graph partitioning methods will be able to correctly identify the two communites.

Communities in real-world networks tend to overlap as nodes belong to multiple communities at once. However, the Preceding approaches have a common limitation, as they assume that communities do not overlap, that is, nodes cannot belong to more than a single community at once.

However, applying the the strength of weak ties view to overlapping communities leads to the (unnatural) structure of community overlaps, as illustrated in Figure 16(b). Notice that here the nodes residing in the overlap of two communities do not link to each other. This means that nodes that have multiple communities in common have a lower probability of linking. This means that the probability of an edge between a pair of nodes decreases as the number of shared community memberships of a pair increases. Later in the section, we will show that this implicit assumption is made by most present community detection methods. For example, the clique percolation method [Palla et al. 2005], link clustering [Ahn et al. 2010], latent Dirichlet allocation-based methods [Airoldi et al. 2007; Blei et al. 2003; Henderson and Eliassi-Rad 2009; Zhou et al. 2006], and many extensions of these methods [Lee et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2009] all operate under the implicit assumption illustrated in Figure 16(b).
However, our results in Figure 5 suggest exactly the opposite. The probability of an edge increases with the number of shared communities between a pair of nodes. This suggest the structure of community overlaps, as illustrated in Figure 16(c). Here the nodes that reside in the area of the overlap between two communities are more likely to be linked.

More importantly, as many methods implicitly assume sparse community overlaps (Figure 16(b)), this means that they are unable to correctly identify the overlaps be-tween communities when communities overlap, as illustrated in Figure 16(c). In par-ticular, most present community detection methods will either confuse the overlap as a separate community or merge the overlapping communities into a single giant community [Clauset et al. 2004].

In the following, we show that three widely used overlapping community detection methods all suffer from implicitly assuming sparse community overlaps. In particular, we analyze the clique percolation method [Palla et al. 2005], link clustering [Ahn et al. 2010], and the mixed membership stochastic block model [Airoldi et al. 2007].
Clique Percolation. We begin by showing that the clique percolation method fails to properly detect two desenly overlapping communities, as illustrated in Figure 16(c).
The clique percolation method (CPM) has a single input parameter k which deter-mines the size of the maximal cliques that the algorithm looks for. After finding all the k -cliques on the given network, the method merges two k -cliques if they share k  X  1 nodes. Overlaps can happen when the nodes in the overlaps belong to multiple k -cliques that cannot be merged. When an overlap is denser, however, nodes in the overlap form many k -cliques themselves, and the k -cliques in the overlap would be likely to merge together. In this case, the method would either confuse the overlap as a separate com-munity or merge adjacent communities through k -cliques in the overlap.

For example, Figure 17 shows the result of CPM on the network of Figure 16(c), where the overlap between the two communities is denser than the individual communities. When k = 3, CPM finds a community that covers the whole network, because the clique in the overlap connects the cliques in the left community and the right community, whereas CPM finds a community of the overlap when k = 4.

In addition to the clique percolation method, there are many other overlapping com-munity detection methods that are based on expanding the maximal cliques. These methods (e.g., greedy clique expansion [Lee et al. 2010] and EAGLE [Shen et al. 2009]) also suffer from the same problem. By the same reasoning that we used for clique percolation, we can see that none of these clique expansion methods would be able to discover densely-overlapping communities.

Link Clustering. Next we show that link clustering [Ahn et al. 2010] also suffers from the same problems. Link clustering performs hierarchical clustering on the edges of the given network. For each pair of edges ( i , k )and( j , k ) that shares a single node neighbors n ( i )and n ( j )ofnodes i and j and builds a dendrogram by merging the pair of edges with the highest Jaccard similarity. Finally, link clustering cuts the dendrogram at the point where the partition density, a quality function proposed in Ahn et al. [2010], is maximized. In the following, we show that link clustering does not discover the true communities when their overlaps are more densely connected than each individual community.
 We consider a network with two overlapping communities A and B , with their overlap O (Figure 18). Let A and B each contain X + Y nodes, and O contains X nodes. The total number of nodes in the network is thus X + 2 Y . Moreover, assume that the nodes in an individual community are connected with probability p and that the nodes in the overlap have a higher probability of being connected, say 2 p . Now let X  X  consider the case where the number of nodes in the overlap is not larger than the number belonging to a single community ( X  X  Y ).

Now consider that link clustering computes Jaccard similarity between the neighbors of nodes u and v . Without loss of generality, we can have one of the four cases: (1) u  X  O and v  X  O ;(2) u  X  A \ O and v  X  A \ O ;(3) u  X  A \ O and v  X  O ;And(4) u  X  A \ O and v  X  B \ O .

We now show that the Jaccard similarity between a pair of edges in case (1) is higher than in case (2), and that case (2) also is higher than case (3), which is naturally higher than case (4). This means that link clustering will first merge edges between nodes in O , and only then merge the edges between nodes in A \ O and edges between nodes in B \ O . Last, link clustering will merge the edges with one endpoint in O and the other in A \ O ( B \ O ). This process will produce the dendrogram illustrated in Figure 18. In particular, this means that regardless of where one cuts the dendrogram, link clustering will fail to correctly identify the community structure of the simple network in Figure 18.

To show this more formally, we proceed as follows. Let X  X  consider nodes a 1 , a 2  X  A \ O expectation the following is true: and we aim to compute the expected values of the sizes of the intersections between because o 1and o 2 would have a common neighbor in single community regions (2 Y nodes) with probability p 2 and in overlap ( X nodes) with probability (2 p ) 2 .Bythesame derive the following: | n ( o 1)  X  n ( o 2) | | n ( o 1) |+| n ( o 2) | where the last inequality 1 / 2  X  (2 X + Y ) / (3 X + 3 Y ) comes from our assumption that X  X  Y . Therefore, link clustering yields the dendrogram in Figure 18, which first merges edges in O and then merges edges in the two non-overlapping parts ( A \ O , B \ O ) and only then merges edges between the overlapping and the non-overlapping parts ( O , A \ O ) , ( O , B \ O ).

Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model. We also briefly mention that the stochas-tic block models [Airoldi et al. 2007; Holland et al. 1983; Karrer and Newman 2011] may not discover the communities with dense overlaps. A stochastic block model [Holland et al. 1983] partitions a network into disjoint blocks and assigns an edge probability to each block. The only way for the model to increase the edge probability among the nodes in the overlaps is to regard overlaps as separate blocks with higher edge density than individual communities. For example, Figure 19 illustrates the adjacency matrix of the network of Figure 16(c) and the block structure modeled by stochastic block models.
The mixed-membership stochastic block model can discover overlapping communi-ties. However, the model cannot produce the network of dense overlap in Figure 19. For example, the edge probability between two nodes that belong to communities A and B bility between a node in community X and a node in community Y . This means that the edge probability between the two nodes is smaller than the maximum of P ( A , A )and P ( B , B ), as we assume that the edge probability between the two communities is not higher than the edge probability inside a community. Therefore, the edge probability between overlapping nodes cannot be higher than the edge probability between nodes in an individual community.

Models that Do Not Assume Sparse Community Overlaps. Last we also mention that there exist few community detection methods that do not make the implicit assumption of sparse community overlaps. Here we emphasize that the issue of the structure of community overlaps has been largely overlooked and that none of the methods cited next actually realized they are making assumptions about sparse/dense community overlaps. Our analysis showed that the following methods do not assume sparse community overlaps and would in fact correctly identify the two overlapping communities in Figure 16(c).

The first method that would detect densely-overlapping communities is a statistical model of network communities by Ball et al. [2011]. In particular, Ball et al. present an extension of stochastic block model where node community memberships are not mod-eled by a multinomial distribution, but every node i maintains a factor k i , c that models the amount by which node i belongs to community c . This way one can think of node membership as described by a non-normalized multinomial distribution which allows for modeling an increased density of the edges in the community overlaps. However, the inference with the model is not particularly scalable due to the model X  X  generality.
Similarly, M X rup et al. [2011] developed a nonparametric Bayesian multiple mem-bership latent feature model for networks where edges of the network are generated by using a soft-OR function. And last, Gregory [2010] also developed a heuristic method for network community detection for which our analysis shows that it might be able to correctly identify densely overlapping communities. In this article we identified a set of networks with explicitly defined ground-truth com-munities. This allowed us to investigate the structure and overlaps of ground-truth communities in networks. We observed that the overlaps of communities are more densely connected than the non-overlapping parts of communities, which is in contrast to assumptions made by present community detection models and methods. We also observed that ground-truth communities contain high-degree hub nodes that reside in community overlaps and link to most of the members of the community. We then presented the community-affiliation graph model (AGM), a conceptual model of net-work community structure, which reliably captures the overall structure of networks as well as the overlapping nature of network communities.

Our results have relevance in multiple settings. First, our analysis sheds light on the organization of complex networks and provides new directions for research on community detection. Second, ground-truth communities offer a reliable ground-truth for community evaluation that was impossible to do before. Last, the AGM provides a realistic benchmark network for development and evaluation of community detection methods. A natural step for future work is building on these findings and designing community detection methods that can detect dense overlaps.
