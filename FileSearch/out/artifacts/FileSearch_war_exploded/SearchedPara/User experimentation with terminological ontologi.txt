Modern lexicography and terminology are converging (Cabr X , 1999). Traditionally, term i-nology and lexicography have been separate r e-search fields with different approaches to compilation and presentation of data. Howev er, modern technology offers unlimited opportun i-ties to meet the needs for several target groups in one database by offering the possibility of choo s-ing between different presentations, in theory, providing means for knowledge transfer across different inf ormation modes. 
Madsen and Thomsen (2008) argue that s y s-tematic t erminology work ensure s consistency across the entries of a given database ( ISO 704:2009 ) . This improves the quality of the i n-formation tool considerably compared to other types of specializ ed reference works. T hus, t he end -user is presented with consistent information in a written mode representing the terminological information such as definitions, synonyms, equivale nts and sources . I n practice, however, concept clarification usually takes a more grap h-ical starting point , i n particular, when terminol o-gy and knowledge bank s follow the principles of terminological ontologies (concept systems) pr e-viously dis cussed by Madsen and Thomsen ( 2008) . Here t erminological ontologies are d e-fined as domai n -specific ontologies where ce r-tain aspects of terminology theory have been formalized: Characteristics are modeled by fo r-mal feature specifications (attribute -value pairs) and subdivision criteria that correspond to the attributes of the feature specifica tions. In other words , t erminologists may structure their knowledge by means of concept systems , then develop consistent defin i tions, and subsequently process them into article -like entries using a knowledge management tool ( Madsen, 1999 ) . T his implies tha t the graphical structuring is ce n-tral to terminology method and theory , and end -u sers should have access into the underlying o n-tology or concept system ( graph mode ) as a complementary source of knowledge .

This short paper presents expe r iment s with the primary purpose of exploring Danish end -users X  understanding of concept sy s tems . The prelim i-nary results imply that d o main -specific knowledge in terminological resources can be transferred efficiently to users across di f ferent levels of expertise and by means of diffe r ent i n-formation modes. The paper ou t lines work -in -progress research and will focus on the info r-mation mode variable . The paper is o r ganized as follows: i n section 2 the method is outlined ; i n section 3 the eye -tracking exper i ments are d e-scribed , and i n section 4 the preli m inary results suggested by the experiments are presented fo l-lowed by a concl u sion in section 5 . An experimental approach is applied with Danish professional potential end -users partic i-pat ing in an eye -tracking exper i ment . 2.1 Information mode s
Terminology work is concept -oriented (ISO 704:2009; Madsen, 1999), which means that synonyms are registered in one entry in the dat a-base, while lexicography is word -oriented, i.e. one dictionary entry co m prises all meanings of an entry -word. With the use of databases, ho w-ever, the possi bilities for presentation do no longer depend on the structure of the data colle c-tion, and thus it is possible to present data from a termino logical ontology with a co n cept -oriented structure in a word -oriented user interface. Te r-minology resources contain lexicographic (wri t-ten) information such as definitions, sources, synonyms and equivalents, but the terminology work offers a complementary g raphical info r-mation mode disp laying the concept position and relations to other concepts (ISO 704:2009). Therefore, both information modes carry knowledge that can be transferred to end -users. 2.2 Experiment stimuli
Co ncept diagrams carry the same amount of information across eight block s. Each block re p-resents a taxation term: direct tax; land tax; mi d-dle -bracket tax; personal income tax ; energy tax; excise duty; green tax; motor vehicles tax . The stimulus template is shown in Figure 1.

Concept diagrams in clude 5 -7 concepts stru c-tured in three levels filling out half of the screen . Articles are equally sized present ing more d e-tailed information (term, definition, equivalent, and comment including sources of both the Da n-ish source language and the English ta rget la n-guage). The eye -tracking stimuli are thus constructed to provide participants with a do u-ble -mode design and each stimulus comprises three primary areas of interest (AOIs): the AOI -question (at the upper part of the screen); the AOI -diagram (placed below); the AOI -article (placed on the opposite side of the diagram) . Figure 1 shows an example of excise duty and the question translated into English is  X  X hat type of tax or duty is excise duty? 1. Direct tax; 2. General tax; 3. Indirect tax.  X 
I n the exp eriment, the article entry and co n-cept diagram of the stimuli are static images. I n the real system , users should be allowed fun c-tionalities to unfold concept diagrams and art i-cles further. The stimuli of the eye -tracking experiment can be seen as design a rtefacts clos e-ly resembling articles and concept diagrams of an existing knowledge management tool i -T erm ( DANTERMc entre ) . This approach constitutes a usual starting point of human work interaction design (Clemmensen, 2011). In addition, i t is being assume d that users have entered the term i-nology and knowledge bank correctly and found the concept represented in the relevant diagram (graph mode) or article (written mode) necessary for concept clarification . 2.3 Question types
The experiment begins with a readin g task u s-ing a specialized text in participants X  first la n-guage (Danish) . T hen 48 multiple -choice concept -clarifying questions (trials) resulting from six types of questions about concept clarif i-c a tion pertai n ing to each of the eight chosen d o-main -specific t erms (blocks) are posed. Que s tions can be a n swered by consulting info r-mation in either one of the information modes , or the answer lies in both: The six ques tion types i n clude : sub -ordinates (First di agram -based que s tion); sub -division criteria (Second diagram -based que s tion); equiv a lents (First article -based question); comments (Second article -based que s-tion); s u per -ordinate (First diagram -and article -based question ); characteristics (Second di a-gram -and article -based question ). The six que s-tion types are randomly distributed across the eight blocks . T he eight blocks are also ran do m-iz ed, and so is the display -side of the information modes ( di a gram to the right and article to the left side of the scree n or vice versa ).
The sample comprises 40 Danish professional potential end -users of the termino l ogy and knowledge bank in the taxation domain . 3.1 Experimental design
An experimental approach is applied in an eye -trackin g laboratory, where a natural user si t-uation is replicated. The approach is guided by the triangulation principle resulting in both qua n-titative and qualitative data (Holmquist et al., 2011) that will contribute to the understanding of profession al end -users X  performance and perce p-tion which contribute to the subs e quent interface design process , in particular , for the development of personas and scenarios (Nielsen, 2002 ) .
Prior to the experiment, participants X  d o main -specific expertise is measured in a combined a s-sessment compri s ing self -assessment and a test revealing their declarative knowledge in the tax a tion domain . In particular, participants are asked to fill out a background questionnaire comprising a declaration of consent, background infor mation (age, gender, education, industry, typical tasks during their professional working day), introduction to concept clarification and a terminology warm -up exercise.

During the experiment, participants are asked multiple -choice questions pe r taining to concept clarification in the taxation domain , while they are presented with the double -mode stim uli and their eye -movements are being recorded. A r e-mote SensoMotoric Instrument ( SMI ) eye -tracker, which supports gaze sampling rates of 50 Hz, is used for the recordings of participants X  on -screen eye -movements. The experiment is built in the psychology software E -prime , which facilitates randomization, records user responses, and informs participants whether they answered correctly or not .

After the exper i ment , a retrospective interview is conducted with the participants. Here they evaluate their performance, preference and needs pertaining to concept clarification , including their use of taxation texts , in their work . In total, the e x periment lasts about one hour. 3.2 Sampling across expertise
When compiling specialized dictionaries , it is necessary to distinguish between different types of users, i.e. experts, semi -experts and laymen (Gouws, 2009) . Therefore, it has been crucial in the s ampling of participants for the eye -tracking experiment that they represent different levels of expertise ranging from high expert to low non -expert level. In the sample, half of participants are staff me m bers from The Central Customs and Tax Administratio n (SKAT) working in the taxation domain as e.g. legal advisers, econ o-mists, software developers, business analysts, communicators, translators or generalists. The remaining participants are profession al staff member s from e.g. private companies, univers i-ti es and other government organizations . All pa r-ticipants have Danish as their first language, and all questions and concept diagrams are in Da n-ish.

The background questionnaire primarily a s-sesses declarative knowledge skills in the tax a-tion domain, whereas the eye -tracking experiments also require procedural knowledge or logical reasoning skills. Expertise variables should reflect the expertise needed in the expe r-iments . In order to overcome any discre p ancy between the d eclarative nature of the a s sess ment and the procedural nature of the expertise nee d-ed, t he expertise assessment also comprise pa r-ti c ipants X  information seeking skills and their weekly number of electronic searches in search engines, terminological resources such as enc y-clopedia, dictionary or term banks . 3.3 Eye -tracking measures
In eye -tracking resear ch, the recorded eye movements are analyzed by means of detecting events, i.e. measures accounting for scan paths (where do participants look and do they revisit AOIs ) and fixation duration (what do partic i-pants look at and do they fixate on AOIs ) (Holmqui st et al., 2011). In particular, the eye -to -mind -hypothesis (Just and Carpe n ter, 1980) uses eye -movements (fixations) to indicate the cogn i-tive effort needed to process and unde r stand stimuli .
Preliminary results reveal a  X  learning effect  X  which r e duc es the response time s of participants across the 48 trials without reducing the relative number of correct answers . Moreover, high rel a-tive a v e r age fixation duration per trial in the AOI -diagram and the AOI -article on diagram and article que s tions respectively , suggests that users  X  know  X  where to look for answers a nd can access info r mation in the graph mode .

Potential interactions were observed during the experiments , but need further testing as part of the inferential statistical analyses :
P articipants a s sess ing their level of expertise to be high on the expertise measure (experts) are quite critical towards the stimuli . Experts have a high success rate, but they are sometimes co n-fused by the simplified concept diagrams and article entries of this experiment and expres s verbally their disagre e ment. In addition, e xperts express a high preference for the detailed and precise articles compared to diagrams, which they might be confused by. O nce they have learned to navigate the experiment, they start appreciating the advantages of diagrams, esp e-cially if they were new to a field, including the double -mode interface d e sign.

Participants assessing their level of expertise to be low on the exper tise measure (non -experts) have hardly any opinion on the taxation domain . Non -experts tend to be overwhelmed by the complex taxation domain and spend quite a long time understanding the questions and i n fo r-mation m odes. Ho w ever, if the long response time is disregarded, non -experts perform quite well. The learning effect also applies to non -experts who learn to navigate the information modes across the expe r iment.

An inherent impatience is revealed dur ing the experiments. It seems to lead participants to fuzzy scan paths and random guesses if they do not locate an answer in side the stimuli space . This impatience is due to the time pressure that participants feel they are perfor m ing under and the fact that the answer  X  X o not know X  is not available to them. Opposed to the inherent imp a-tience, which tends to shorten the response time, an inherent insecurity tends to prolong the r e-sponse time. The inherent insecur i ty makes pa r-ticipants search for ans wers they already know or have already found. 
Despite the inherent drawbacks due to the e x-perimental design, it can be concluded that d o-main -specific knowledge is transferred across written and graph modes to both experts and non -e xperts . It should be noted that complete d e scriptive and inferential statistical analyses are in progress. In addition, t he eye -tracking exper i-ments constitute a first step, which need s to be followed by future research on a dynamic system version offering pa r ticipants the possibility of interact ing with the article entries and concept diagrams of the terminology and knowledge bank .
 T he research is funded by the VELUX F OUNDATION and constitutes sub -project three of the DanTermBank project which aims at d e-veloping the foundations for the establishment of a terminol o gy and knowledge base in Denmark .
