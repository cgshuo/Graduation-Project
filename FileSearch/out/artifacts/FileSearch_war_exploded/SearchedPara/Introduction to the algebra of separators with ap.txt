 1. Introduction
Many problems in engineering amount to characterizing a set of

More a set X de fi ned by constraints between two sets X and X  X  that X X X  X  :  X  1  X  approximation of X , two main classes of approaches are consid-ered: symbolic and numerical. The symbolic approach provides a set of methods based on computer algebra that are guaranteed, ef fi cient, but limited to polynomial problems. The numerical approaches are mainly composed with linear methods (for which convex methods (such as those based on semide fi nite program-ming Henrion et al., 2009 ), Monte-Carlo methods (which can be val methods is similar to Monte Carlo except that they compute ods) in a guaranteed way (contrary to Monte-Carlo). The main drawbacks of interval methods are the high complexity with respect to the number of unknown variables and the lack of without removing any solution. Contractor-based techniques algorithm which partitions the research space with boxes) can provide an outer subpaving approximation X  X  of X in an ef to express the complementary set X of X . Then basic contractor techniques can be used to get an inner characterization X Now, the task is not so easy and has never been made automatic. object, named separator , which is composed of two complemen-tary contractors: an inner contractor and an outer contractor.
These two contractors are computed together by focusing on the these separators. This will make it possible to easily build separators associated with complex sets X . Combined with a subpavings X and X  X  in an easy way and without asking the programmer to build both the inner and the outer contractors. and shows how they can be used inside a paver to characterize be de fi ned. More complex separators will be obtained by compo-2. Separators show how separators can be used by a paver in order to bracket the solution set X between two subpavings X and X  X  . 2.1.

Separators  X  x A IR n ,wehave  X  X  x  X [ S out  X  X  x  X  X  X  x  X  complementarity  X  :  X  8  X  A set S is consistent with the separator S (we will write S S out and S S in :  X  9  X   X  S  X  X  x  X  X  S in  X  X  x  X \ S out  X  X  x  X  :  X  10  X  Note that the remainder is a contractor and not a separator. Example. Fig. 1 represents a set S , an outer contractor S out inner contractor S in and a boundary contractor  X  S . The pair f S in ; S out g corresponds to a separator associated with part of the research space which is inside S whereas S out eliminates the part which is outside S , i.e. , S in  X  X  x  X \ S  X  X  x \ S

For a given box  X  x , it is trivial to show that : S in  X  X  x  X  and  X  S  X  X  x  X  cover  X  x , i.e., : S in  X  X  x  X [: S out  X  X  x  X [  X  S  X  X  x  X  X  X  x :  X  11  X  Moreover, they do not overlap each other. By applying the De Morgan rule on the complementarity property (8) , we get that : ( S in ; S out ) representation.

Consider two separators S 1 and S 2 .Wede fi ne the inclusion between the separators as follows: S A separator S is minimal if S 1 S ) S 1  X  S :  X  13  X  It is trivial to check that S is minimal if and only if the two contractors S in and S out are both minimal. 2.3. Paver
A paver is a branch-and-bound algorithm which calls the After completion of the algorithm, we have the enclosure X X X  X  .

The binary tree is said to be minimal if for any node i the root) with brother i 2 and father j ,wehave 8 &gt; &lt; &gt; : (ii) of (14) is not satis fi ed, then the two brother nodes i subpaving. An illustration is provided in Fig. 3 . 3. Algebra expression E of other contractors C i then we always have 8 i ; C i C 0 i ) E  X  C 1 ; C 2 ; ...  X  E  X  C 0 1 ; C 0 2
As a consequence the complementary C of a contractor C or the to non-monotonic operations) cannot be de fi ned. The main for contractors to non-monotonic expressions. Let us now de de fi ne the complement as

We de fi ne the exponentiation of a separator S  X f S in ; S out induction as follows:  X f&gt; ; &gt;g  X f: S k out  X   X  S in  X   X  S k  X  ; : S k in  X   X  S out  X   X  S k (i.e. &gt; X  X  x  X  X  X  x ). Note that  X f: X  S 0  X  out  X  S in  X   X  X  S 0  X  in \ X  S 0  X  out  X  ; : X  S 0  X  in  X  S out  X   X  X  S 0  X  in \ X  S 0  X  out  X g  X f:&gt;  X  S in  X  &gt;\&gt; X  ; :&gt;  X  S out  X  &gt;\&gt; X g  X f S in ; S out  X g X  S :
The role of the exponentiation is to produce more ef fi cient separators by using fi xed point methods. If S i  X f S in i i
A f 1 ; 2 ; ... ; m g are m separators, we de fi ne

The proof of other all other properties is similar.  X  4. Inversion of separators

X for X can be de fi ned using a generalization of the forward backward contractor as shown in Chabert (2013) . The contractor C
X is called the inverse of C Y by f and we write C X  X  f 1 separator S Y as follows: f 1  X  S Y  X  X f f 1  X  S in Y  X  ; f 1  X  S out Y  X g :  X  21  X  set X  X  f 1  X  Y  X  , i.e., f 1  X  Y  X  f 1  X  S Y  X  :  X  22  X  Proof. We have Y 3 Y S out Y ; Y S in Y  X  see  X  9  X  X  3 f 1  X  Y  X  f 1  X  S out Y  X  ; f 1  X  Y  X  f 1  X  S in Y  X  3 f 1  X  Y  X f f 1  X  S in Y  X  ; f 1  X  S out Y  X g X  see  X  9  X  X  3 f 1  X  Y  X  f 1  X  S Y  X  X  see  X  22  X  X  X  23  X  which terminates the proof.  X  Example. Consider the following function: f  X  x 1 ; x 2  X  X  x 1  X  2 x 2 :  X  24  X  Separator. S X (in:  X  x ; S Y ; out: f X  x in ;  X  x out g ). 1  X  y  X  X  x 1  X  2  X  x 2 ; 2  X  y in  X  S in Y  X  X  y  X  ;  X  y out  X  S out Y  X  X  y  X  ; 3  X  x in  X  X  x ;  X  x out  X  X  x ; 4  X  x in 1  X  X  x in 1 \ X  y in 2  X  x in 2 ; 6  X  x out 1  X  X  x out 1 \ X  y out 2  X  x out 2 ; 7  X  x out 2  X  X  x out 2 \ 1 2  X  X  y out  X  x out 1  X  . The inputs of the algorithm are the box  X  x and the separator S . Step 1 corresponds to the forward propagation and computes respect to the inner and the outer contractors associated with 4 and 5 correspond to the backward propagation associated with only one forward propagation (Step 1) and two backward propa-forward propagations would have been needed: one for the inner contractor and one for the outer contractor. Note also that we could have a single backward propagation by limiting the back- X   X  x that has been obtained after the backward propagation. 5. Atomic separators
Complex separators are built from operations and compositions and those that are associated with a database. 5.1. Equation-based separators
A typical situation where we can take advantage of contractor set de fi ned by a mathematical expression. For instance, if X  X f f  X  x  X  r 0 g ;  X  25  X  . 5.2. Database-based separators
A contractor represents information. This information can be an equation or an inequality, but it can also come from a database (for instance it can be the map of the surrounding environment or the shape of an object). In this situation, it is often more now show an example that the boundary representation may help boundary  X  M of M . Since the union of minimal contractors is for  X  M is  X  S  X  X  x  X  X   X  where  X  X  x \  X  i is the smallest box enclosing  X  x \  X  .
 (for instance the two corners of  X  x represented in sub fi that have been eliminated by  X  S .

Remark. If we use a pure contractor approach to compute S in boundary but the computation of the boundary intersecting  X  x will have to be performed twice: once for S in and once for
Contrary to a contractor, a separator approach considers that a should be factorized.  X  6. Application to path planning in a known environment has been addressed for many years (see, e.g., Laumond, 1986 Lozano-P X rez, 1981; O'Dunlaing and
Yap, 1982; Koditschek, 1987 ) and can easily be combined with set-membership techniques to take into account some uncertain-such robots are industrial robots which are kinematic chains in each with one degree of freedom. The positions and orientations numbers, which are the coordinates of a single n -dimensional point in the C-space ( Lozano-P X rez, 1983 ). The feasible con this section is to show how separators could solve the path planning problem on a simple example which is a 2D version of the wire loop game. This game involves a metal loop on a handle in one hand and attempts to guide it along the curved wire the loop is a segment. The curved wire corresponds to the boundary, a set Y with an inside (gray in the fi gure) and an respectively. The length of the loop is 1. The feasible con space is M  X f X  x 1 ; x 2  X j f 2  X  x  X  A Y and f 3  X  x  X  = 2 Y g X  f 1 where f  X  x  X  X  4 If 5.2 ), then a separator for M is S M  X  f 1 2  X  S Y  X \ f 1 3  X  S Y  X  :  X  28  X  to a solution of our wire loop game. The minimality of the the subpaving intersects the boundary of the solution set. The corresponding motion in the world space is depicted in Fig. 7 . M we get the contractor counterpart 8 &lt; : The separator formalism thus makes it possible get directly the This was not possible using contractor algebra which does not rewrite the complementary expression. Moreover, the separator algebra requires less computation since a part of the common computation that is made for S in M and S out M is factorized. 7. Conclusion of R n . To compute the union, the intersection or any other ing contractor will provide a guaranteed approximation of the the complement or the set difference. The main contribution of complementary contractors. Since the complementary operator or allows us to compute with sets in a much more general way. The application to robotics is direct as soon as we want to compute are needed to fi nd a feasible path.
