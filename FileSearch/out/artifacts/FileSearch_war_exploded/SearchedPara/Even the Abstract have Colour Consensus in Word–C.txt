 Colour is a vital component in the successful deliv-ery of information, whether it is in marketing a com-mercial product (Sable and Akcay, 2010), in web design (Meier, 1988; Pribadi et al., 1990), or in in-formation visualization (Christ, 1975; Card et al., 1999). Since real-world concepts have associations with certain colour categories (for example, danger with red, and softness with pink), complementing linguistic and non-linguistic information with appro-priate colours has a number of benefits, including: (1) strengthening the message (improving semantic coherence), (2) easing cognitive load on the receiver, (3) conveying the message quickly, and (4) evoking the desired emotional response. Consider, for exam-ple, the use of red in stop signs. Drivers are able to recognize the sign faster, and it evokes a subliminal emotion pertaining to possible danger, which is en-tirely appropriate in the context. The use of red to show areas of high crime rate in a visualization is another example of good use of colour to draw emo-tional response. On the other hand, improper use of colour can be more detrimental to understanding than using no colour (Marcus, 1982; Meier, 1988).
A word has strong association with a colour when the colour is a salient feature of the concept the word refers to, or because the word is related to a such a concept. Many concept X  X olour associa-tions, such as swan with white and vegetables with green, involve physical entities. However, even ab-stract notions and emotions may have colour as-sociations ( honesty  X  X hite, danger  X  X ed, joy  X  X ellow, anger  X  X ed). Further, many associations are culture-specific (Gage, 1969; Chen, 2005). For example, prosperity is associated with red in much of Asia.
Unfortunately, there exists no lexicon with any significant coverage that captures these concept X  colour associations, and a number of questions re-main unanswered, such as, the extent to which hu-mans agree with each other on these associations, and whether physical concepts are more likely to have a colour association than abstract ones.
In this paper, we describe how we created a large word X  X olour lexicon by crowdsourcing with effec-tive quality control measures (Section 3), as well as experiments and analyses to show that:  X  More than 30% of the terms have a strong  X  About 33% of thesaurus categories have strong  X  Abstract terms have colour associations almost  X  There is a strong association between different Thus, using the right colours can not only improve semantic coherence, but also inspire the desired emotional response. The relation between language and cognition has re-ceived considerable attention over the years, mainly on answering whether language impacts thought, and if so, to what extent. Experiments with colour categories have been used both to show that language has an effect on thought (Brown and Lenneberg, 1954; Ratner, 1989) and that it does not (Bornstein, 1985). However, that line of work does not explicitly deal with word X  X olour associations. In fact, we did not find any other academic work that gathered large word X  X olour associations. There is, however, a commercial endeavor X  X ymbolism 1 .
Child et al. (1968), Ou et al. (2011), and others show that people of different ages and genders have different colour preferences. (See also the online study by Joe Hallock 2 .) In this work, we are inter-ested in identifying words that have a strong associa-tion with a colour due to their meaning; associations that are not affected by age and gender preferences.
There is substantial work on inferring the emo-tions evoked by colour (Luscher, 1969; Kaya, 2004). Strapparava and Ozbal (2010) compute corpus-based semantic similarity between emotions and colours. We combine a word X  X olour and a word X  emotion lexicon to determine the association be-tween emotion words and colours.

Berlin and Kay (1969), and later Kay and Maffi (1999), showed that often colour terms appeared in languages in certain groups. If a language has only two colour terms, then they are white and black. If a language has three colour terms, then they tend to be white, black, and red. Such groupings are seen for up to eleven colours, and based on these groupings, colours can be ranked as follows: There are hundreds of different words for colours. 3 To make our task feasible, we chose to use the eleven basic colour words of Berlin and Kay (1969).
The MRC Psycholinguistic Database (Coltheart, 1981) has, among other information, the imageabil-ity ratings for 9240 words. 4 The imageability rat-ing is a score given by human judges that reflects how easy it is to visualize the concept. It is a scale from 100 (very hard to visualize) to 700 (very easy to visualize). We use the ratings in our experiments to determine whether there is a correlation between imageability and strength of colour association. We used the Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard, 1986) as the source for terms to be annotated by people on Mechanical Turk. 5 Thesauri, such as the Roget X  X  and Macquarie , group related words into categories. These categories can be thought of as coarse senses (Yarowsky, 1992; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006). If a word is ambiguous, then it is listed in more than one category. Since we were additionally interested in determining colour signatures for emotions (Sec-tion 7), we chose to annotate all of the 10,170 word X  sense pairs that Mohammad and Turney (2010) used to create their word X  X motion lexicon. Below is an example questionnaire: Q1 is a word choice question generated automati-cally by taking a near-synonym from the thesaurus and random distractors. If an annotator answers this question incorrectly, then we discard informa-tion from both Q1 and Q2. The near-synonym also guides the annotator to the desired sense of the word. Further, it encourages the annotator to think clearly about the target word X  X  meaning; we believe this im-proves the quality of the annotations in Q2.
The colour options in Q2 were presented in ran-dom order. We do not provide a  X  X ot associated with any colour X  option to encourage colour selec-tion even if the association is weak. If there is no association between a word and a colour, then we expect low agreement for that term. We requested annotations from five different people for each term.
The annotators on Mechanical Turk, by design, are anonymous. However, we requested annotations from US residents only. About 10% of the annotations had an incorrect an-swer to Q1. Since, for these instances, the annotator did not know the meaning of the target word, we discarded the corresponding colour association re-sponse. Terms with less than three valid annotations were discarded from further analysis. Each of the remaining terms has, on average, 4.45 distinct anno-tations. The information from multiple annotators was combined by taking the majority vote, result-ing in a lexicon with 8,813 entries. Each entry con-tains a unique word X  X ynonym pair, majority voted colour(s), and a confidence score X  X umber of votes for the colour / number of total votes. (For the analy-ses in Sections 5, 6, and 7, ties were broken by pick-ing one colour at random.) A separate version of the lexicon that includes entries for all of the valid anno-tations by each of the annotators is also available. 6
The first row in Table 1 shows the percentage of times different colours were associated with the tar-get term. The second row shows percentages af-ter taking a majority vote of the annotators. Even though the colour options were presented in random order, the order of the most frequently associated colours is identical to the Berlin and Kay order (Sec-tion 2:(1)).

The number of ambiguous words annotated was 2924. 1654 (57%) of these words had senses that were associated with at least two different colours. Table 4 gives a few examples.

Table 4 shows how often the majority class in colour associations is 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. If we assume independence, then the chance that none of the 5 annotators agrees with each other (ma-jority class size of 1) is 1  X  10 / 11  X  9 / 11  X  8 / 11  X  7 / 11 = 0 . 344 . Thus, if there was no correlation among any of the terms and colours, then 34.4% of the time none of the annotators would have agreed with each other. However, this happens only 15.1% of the time. A large number of terms have a ma-jority class size  X  2 (84.9%), and thus have more than chance association with a colour. One can ar-gue that terms with a majority class size  X  3 (32%) have strong colour associations.

Below are some reasons why agreement values are much lower than certain other tasks, for exam-ple, part of speech tagging:  X  The annotators were not given a  X  X ot associ- X  Words are associated with colours to different  X  The target word X  X ense pair is presented out of Nonetheless, the lexicon is useful for downstream applications because any of the following strategies may be employed: (1) choosing colour associations from only those instances with high agreement, (2) assuming low-agreement terms have no colour asso-ciation, (3) determining colour association of a cat-egory through information from many words, as de-scribed in the next section. Different words within a thesaurus category may not be strongly associated with any colour, or they may be associated with many different colours. We now determine whether there exist categories where the semantic coherence carries over to a strong common association with one colour.

We determine the strength of colour association of a category by first determining the colour c most associated with the terms in it, and then calculating the ratio of the number of times a word from the cat-egory is associated with c to the number of words in the category associated with any colour. Only cate-gories that had at least four words that also appear in the word X  X olour lexicon were considered; 535 of the 812 categories from Macquarie Thesaurus met this condition. If a category has exactly four words that appear in the colour lexicon, and if all four words are associated with different colours, then the category has the lowest possible strength of colour association X 0.25 (1/4). 19 categories had a score of 0.25. No category had a score less than 0.25. Any score above 0.25 shows more than random chance association with a colour. There were 516 such cat-egories (96.5%). 177 categories (33.1%) had a score 0.5 or above, that is, half or more of the words in these categories are associated with one colour. We consider these to be strong associations. It is natural for physical entities of a certain colour to be associated with that colour. However, abstract concepts such as danger and excitability are also as-sociated with colours X  X ed and orange, respectively. Figure 1 displays an experiment to determine whether there is a correlation between imageability and association with colour.

We define imageability of a thesaurus category to be the average of the imageability ratings of words in it. We calculated imageability for the 535 cate-gories described in the previous section using only the words that appear in the colour lexicon. Figure 1 shows the scatter plot of these categories on the im-ageability and strength of colour association axes. If higher imageability correlated with greater tendency to have a colour association, then we would see most of the points along the diagonal moving up from left to right. Instead, we observe that the strongly associ-ated categories are spread all across the imageability axis, implying that there is only weak, if any, corre-lation. Imageability and colour association have a Pearson X  X  product moment correlation of 0.116, and a Spearman X  X  rank order correlation of 0.102. Emotions such as joy, sadness, and anger are ab-stract concepts dealing with one X  X  psychological state. As pointed out in Section 2, there is prior work on emotions evoked by colours. In contrast, here we investigate the colours associated with emotion words. We combine the word X  X motion association lexicon compiled by Mohammad and Turney (2010; 2011) and our word X  X olour lexicon to determine the colour signature of emotions X  X he rows in Ta-ble 4. Notably, we see that all of the emotions have strong associations with certain colours. Observe that anger is associated most with red. Other nega-tive emotions X  X isgust, fear, sadness X  X o strongest with black. Among the positive emotions: antici-pation is most frequently associated with white and green; joy with white, green, and yellow; and trust with white, blue, and green. Table 4 shows the colour signature for terms marked positive and neg-ative (these include terms that may not be associated with the eight basic emotions). Observe that the neg-ative terms are strongly associated with black and red, whereas the positive terms are strongly associ-ated with white and green. Thus, colour can add to the potency of emotional concepts, yielding even more effective visualizations. We created a large word X  X olour association lexi-con by crowdsourcing. A word-choice question was used to guide the annotator to the desired sense of the target word, and to ensure data quality. We ob-served that abstract concepts, emotions in particu-lar, have strong colour associations. Thus, using the right colours in tasks such as information visualiza-tion, product marketing, and web development, can not only improve semantic coherence, but also in-spire the desired psychological response. Interest-ingly, we found that frequencies of colour choice in associations follow the same order in which colour terms occur in language (Berlin and Kay, 1969). Future work includes developing automatic corpus-based methods to determine the strength of word X  colour association, and the extent to which strong word X  X olour associations manifest themselves as more-than-random chance co-occurrence in text.
