 Amjad Abu-Jbara Abstract We introduce the ACL Anthology Network (AAN), a comprehensive manually curated networked database of citations, collaborations, and summaries in the field of Computational Linguistics. We also present a number of statistics about the network including the most cited authors, the most central collaborators, as well as network statistics about the paper citation, author citation, and author collabo-ration networks.
 Keywords ACL Anthology Network Bibliometrics Scientometrics Citation analysis Citation summaries 1 Introduction The ACL Anthology 1 is one of the most successful initiatives of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The ACL is a society for people working on problems involving natural language and computation. It was initiated by Steven Bird ( 2008 ) and is now maintained by Min Yen Kan. It includes all papers published by ACL and related organizations as well as the Computational Linguistics journal over a period of four decades.

ACL Anthology has a major limitation in that i t is just a collection of papers. It does not include any citation information or any statis tics about the productivity of the various researchers who contributed papers to it. We embarked on an ambitious initiative to manually annotate the entire Anthology an d curate the ACL Anthology Network (AAN). 2
AAN was started in 2007 by our group at the University of Michigan (Radev et al. 2009a , b ). AAN provides citation and collaboration networks of the articles included in the ACL Anthology (excluding book reviews). AAN also includes rankings of papers and authors based on their centrality statistics in the citation and collaboration networks, as well as the citing sentences associated with each citation link. These sentences were extracted automatically using pattern matching and then cleaned manually. Table 1 shows some statistics of the current release of AAN.
In addition to the aforementioned annotations, we also annotated each paper by automated systems for performing tasks like summarization, classification, topic modeling, etc.

Citation annotations in AAN provide a useful resource for evaluations multiple tasks in Natural Language Processing. The text surrounding citations in scientific publications has been studied and used in previous work. Nanba and Okumura ( 1999 ) used the term citing area to refer to citing sentences. They define the citing area as the succession of sentences that appear around the location of a given reference in a scientific paper and have connection to it. They proposed a rule-based algorithm to identify the citing area of a given reference. In Nanba et al. ( 2000 ) they use their citing area identification algorithm to identify the purpose of citation (i.e. the author X  X  reason for citing a given paper). In a similar work, Nakov et al. ( 2004 ) use the term citances to refer to citing sentences. They explored several different uses of citances including the creation of training and testing data for semantic analysis, synonym set creation, database curation, summarization, and information retrieval.

Other previous studies have used citing sentences in various applications such as: scientific paper summarization (Elkiss et al. 2008 ; Qazvinian and Radev 2008 , 2010 ; Mei and Zhai 2008 ; Qazvinian et al. 2010 ; Abu-Jbara and Radev 2011a ), automatic survey generation (Nanba et al. 2000 ; Mohammad et al. 2009 ), and citation function classification (Nanba et al. 2000 ; Teufel et al. 2006 ; Siddharthan and Teufel 2007 ; Teufel 2007 ).

Other services that are built more recently on top of the ACL Anthology include the ACL Anthology Searchbench and Saffron. The ACL Anthology Searchbench (AAS) (Scha  X  fer et al. 2011 ) is a Web-based application for structured search in ACL Anthology. AAS provides semantic, full text, and bibliographic search in the papers included in the ACL Anthology corpus. The goal of the Searchbench is both to serve as a showcase for using NLP for text search, and to provide a useful tool for researchers in Computational Linguistics. However, unlike AAN, AAS does not provide different statistics based on citation networks, author citation and collaboration networks, and content-based lexical networks.

Saffron 3 provides insights to a research community or organization by automat-ically analyzing the content of its publications. The analysis is aimed at identifying the main topics of investigation and the experts associated with these topics within the community. The current version of Saffron provides analysis for ACL and LREC publications as well as other IR and Semantic Web publication libraries. 2 Curation The ACL Anthology includes 18,290 papers (excluding book reviews and posters). We converted each of the papers from PDF to text using a PDF-to-text conversion tool ( www.pdfbox.org ). After this conversion, we extracted the references semi-automatically using string matching. The conversion process outputs all the refer-ences as a single block of continuous running text without any delimiters between references. Therefore, we manually inserted line breaks between references. These references were then manually matched to other papers in the ACL Anthology using a  X  X  X -best X  X  (with k = 5) string matching algorithm built into a CGI interface. A snapshot of this interface is shown in Fig. 1 . The matched references were stored together to produce the citation network. If the cited paper is not found in AAN, we have 5 different options the user can choose from. The first option is  X  X  X ossibly in the anthology but not found, X  X  which is used if the string similarity measure failed to match the citation to the paper in AAN. The second option,  X  X  X ikely in another anthology, X  X  is used if the citation is for a paper in a related conference. We con-sidered the following conferences as related conferences AAAI, AMIA, ECAI, IWCS, TREC, ECML, ICML, NIPS, IJCAI, ICASSP, ECIR, SIGCHI, ICWSM, EUROSPEECH, MT, TMI, CIKM and WWW.
 The third option is used if the cited paper is a journal paper, a technical report, PhD thesis or a book. The last two options are used if the reference is not readable because of an error in the PDF to text conversion or if it is not a reference. We only use references to papers within AAN while computing various statistics.

In order to fix the issue of wrong author names and multiple author identities we had to perform some manual post-processing. The first names and the last names were swapped for a lot of authors. For example, the author name  X  X  X aroline Brun X  X  was present as  X  X  X run Caroline X  X  in some of her papers. Another big source of error was the exclusion of middle names or initials in a number of papers. For example, Julia Hirschberg had two identities as  X  X  X ulia Hirschberg X  X  and  X  X  X ulia B. Hirschberg. X  X  Other numerous spelling mistakes existed. For instance,  X  X  X adeleine Bates X  X  was misspelled as  X  X  X edeleine Bates. X  X  There were about 1,000 such errors that we had to correct manually. In some cases, the wrong author name was included in the metadata and we had to manually prune such author names. For example,  X  X  X ofia Bulgaria X  X  and  X  X  X homas J. Watson X  X  were incorrectly included as author names. Also, there were cases of duplicate papers being included in the anthology. For example, C90-3090 and C90-3091 are duplicate papers and we had to remove such papers. Finally, many papers included incorrect titles in their citation sections. Some used the wrong years and/or venues as well. For example, the following is a reference to a paper with the wrong venue.
 Hiroshi Kanayama Tetsuya Nasukawa. 2006. Fully Automatic Lexicon Expansion for Domain-oriented Sentiment Analysis. In ACL.

The cited paper itself was published in EMNLP 2006 and not ACL 2006 as shown in the reference. In some cases, the wrong conference name was included in the metadata itself. For example, W07-2202 had  X  X  X JCNLP X  X  as the conference name in the metadata while the right conference name is  X  X  X CL X  X . Also, we had to normalize conference names. For example, joint conferences like  X  X  X OLING-ACL X  X  had  X  X  X CL-COLING X  X  as the conference name in some papers.

Our curation of ACL Anthology Networks allows us to maintain various statistics about individual authors and papers within the Computational Linguistics commu-nity. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate snapshots of the different statistics computed for an author and a paper respectively. For each author, AAN includes number of papers, collaborators, author and paper citations, and known affiliations as well as h-index, citations over time, and collaboration graph. Moreover, AAN includes paper metadata such as title, venue, session, year, authors, incoming and outgoing citations, citing sentences, keywords, bibtex item and so forth.

In addition to citation annotations, we have manually annotated the gender of most authors in AAN using the name of the author. If the gender cannot be identified without any ambiguity using the name of the author, we resorted to finding the homepage of the author. We have been able to annotate 8,578 authors this way: 6,396 male and 2,182 female.

The annotations in AAN enable us to extract a subset of ACL-related papers to create a self-contained dataset. For instance, one could use the venue annotation of AAN papers and generate a new self-contained anthology of articles published in BioNLP workshops. 3 Networks Using the metadata and the citations extracted after curation, we have built three different networks. The paper citation network is a directed network in which each node represents a paper labeled with an ACL ID number and edges represent citations between papers. The paper citation network consists of 18,290 papers (nodes) and 84,237 citations (edges).

The author citation network and the author collaboration network are additional networks derived from the paper citation network. In both of these networks a node is created for each unique author. In the author citation network an edge is an occurrence of an author citing another author. For example, if a paper written by Franz Josef Och cites a paper written by Joshua Goodman, then an edge is created between Franz Josef Och and Joshua Goodman. Self-citations cause self-loops in the author citation network. The author citation network consists of 14,799 unique authors and 573,551 edges. Since the same author may cite another author in several papers, the network may consist of duplicate edges. The author citation network consists of 325,195 edges if duplicates are removed.
 In the author collaboration network, an edge is created for each collaborator pair. For example, if a paper is written by Franz Josef Och and Hermann Ney, then an edge is created between the two authors. Table 2 shows some brief statistics about the different releases of the data set (2008 X 2011). Table 3 shows statistics about the number of papers in some of the renowned conferences in Natural Language Processing.
 Various statistics have been computed based on the data set released in 2007 by Radev et al. ( 2009a , b ). These statistics include modified PageRank scores, which eliminate PageRank X  X  inherent bias towards older papers by normalizing the score by age (Radev et al. 2009a , b ), Impact factor, correlations between different measures of impact like h-index, total number of incoming citations, and PageRank. We also report results from a regression analysis using h-index scores from different sources (AAN, Google Scholar) in an attempt to identify multi-disciplinary authors. 4 Ranking This section shows some of the rankings that were computed using AAN. Table 4 lists the 10 most cited papers in AAN along with their number of citations in Google Scholar as of June 2012. The difference in size of the two sites explains the difference in absolute numbers of citations. The relative order is roughly the same except for the more interdisciplinary papers (such as the paper on the structure of discourse), which are disproportionately getting fewer citations in AAN.
 The highest cited paper is (Marcus et al. 1993 ) with 775 citations within AAN. The next papers are about Machine Translation, Maximum Entropy approaches, and Dependency Parsing. Table 5 shows the same ranking (number of incoming citations) for authors. In this table, the values in parentheses exclude self-citations. Other ranking statistics in AAN include author h-index and authors with the least Average Shortest Path (ASP) length in the author collaboration network. Tables 6 , 7 show top 10 authors according these two statistics respectively. 4.1 PageRank scores AAN also includes PageRank scores for papers. It must be noted that the PageRank scores should be interpreted carefully because of the lack of citations outside AAN. Specifically, out of the 155,858 total number of citations, only 84,237 are within AAN. Table 8 shows AAN papers with the highest PageRank per year scores (PR). 5 Related phrases We have also computed the related phrases for every author using the text from the papers they have authored, using the simple TF-IDF scoring scheme. Table 9 shows an example where top related words for the author Franz Josef Och are listed. 6 Citation summaries The citation summary of a paper, P , is the set of sentences that appear in the literature and cite P . These sentences usually mention at least one of the cited paper X  X  contributions. We use AAN to extract the citation summaries of all articles, and thus the citation summary of P is a self-contained set and only includes the citing sentences that appear in AAN papers. Extraction is performed automatically using string-based heuristics by matching the citation pattern, author names and publication year within the sentences.
 The example in Table 10 shows part of the citation summary extracted for Eisner X  X  famous parsing paper. 4 In each of the 4 citing sentences in Table 10 the mentioned contribution of (Eisner 1996 ) is underlined. These contributions are  X  X  X ubic parsing algorithm X  X  and  X  X  X ottom-up-span algorithm X  X  and  X  X  X dge factorization of trees. X  X  This example suggests that different authors who cite a particular paper may discuss different contributions (factoids) of that paper. Figure 4 shows a snapshot of the citation summary for a paper in AAN. The first field in AAN citation summaries is the ACL id of the citing paper. The second field is the number of the citation sentence. The third field represents the line number of the reference in the citing paper.

The citation text that we have extracted for each paper is a good resource to generate summaries of the contributions of that paper. In previous work, (Qazvinian and Radev 2008 ), we used citation sentences and employed a network-based clustering algorithm to summaries of individual papers and more general scientific topics, such as Dependency Parsing, and Machine Translation (Radev et al. 2009a , b ).
 7 Experiments This corpus has already been used in a variety of experiments (Qazvinian and Radev 2008 ; Hall et al. 2008 ; Councill et al. 2008 ; Qazvinian et al. 2010 ). In this section, we describe some NLP tasks that can benefit from this data set. 7.1 Reference extraction After converting a publication X  X  text from PDF to text format, we need to extract the references to build the citation graph. Up till the 2008 release of AAN, we did this process manually. Table 11 shows a reference string in the text format consisting of 5 references spanning multiple lines.

The task is to split the reference string into individual references. Till now, this process has been done manually and we have processed 155,858 citations of which 61,527 citations are within AAN. This data set has already been used for the development of a reference extraction tool, ParsCit (Councill et al. 2008 ). They have trained a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to classify each token as  X  X  X uthor X  X  or  X  X  X enue X  X  or  X  X  X aper Title X  X , etc. in a reference string using manually annotated reference strings as training data. 7.2 Paraphrase acquisition Previously, we showed in Qazvinian and Radev ( 2008 ) that different citations to the same paper they discuss various contributions of the cited paper. Moreover we discussed in Qazvinian and Radev ( 2011 ) that the number of factoids (contributions) show asymptotic behavior when the number of citations grow (i.e., the number of contributions of a paper is limited). Therefore, intuitively multiple citations to the same paper may refer to the same contributions of that paper. Since these sentences are written by different authors, they often use different wording to describe the cited factoid. This enables us to use the set of citing sentence pairs that cover the same factoids to create data sets for paraphrase extraction. For example, the sentences below both cite (Turney 2002 ) and highlight the same aspect of Turney X  X  work using slightly different wordings. Therefore, this sentence pair can be considered paraphrases of each other.

In Turney ( 2002 ), an unsupervised learning algorithm was proposed to classify reviews as recommended or not recommended by averaging sentiment annotation of phrases in reviews that contain adjectives or adverbs.

For example, Turney ( 2002 ) proposes a method to classify reviews as recommended/not recommended, based on the average semantic orientation of the review.

Similarly,  X  X  X isner ( 1996 ) gave a cubic parsing algorithm X  X  and  X  X  X isner ( 1996 ) proposed an O(n 3 ) X  X  could be considered paraphrases of each other. Paraphrase annotation of citing sentences consists of manually labeling which sentence consists of what factoids. Then, if two citing sentences consist of the same set of factoids, they are labeled as paraphrases of each other. As a proof of concept, we annotated 25 papers from AAN using the annotation method described above. This data set consisted of 33,683 sentence pairs of which 8,704 are paraphrases (i.e., discuss the same factoids or contributions).

The idea of using citing sentences to create data sets for paraphrase extraction was initially suggested by Nakov et al. ( 2004 ) who proposed an algorithm that extracts paraphrases from citing sentences using rules based on automatic named entity annotation and the dependency paths between them. 7.3 Topic modeling directions in the field of Computational Linguistics. They also propose a new model to identify which conferences are diverse in terms of topics. They use unsupervised topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al. 2003 ) to induce topic clusters. They identify the existence of 46 different topics in AAN and examine the strength of topics over time to identify trends in Computational Linguistics research. Using the estimated strength of topics over time, they identify which topics have become more prominent and which topics have declined in popularity. They also propose a measure for estimating the diversity in topics at a conference, topic entropy. Using this measure, they identify that EMNLP, ACL, and COLING are increasingly diverse, in that order and are all converging in terms of the topics that they cover. 7.4 Scientific literature summarization The fact that citing sentences cover different aspects of the cited paper and highlight its most important contributions motivates the idea of using citing sentences to summarize research. The comparison that Elkiss et al. ( 2008 ) performed between abstracts and citing sentences suggests that a summary generated from citing sentences will be different and probably more concise and informative than the paper abstract or a summary generated from the full text of the paper. For example, Table 12 shows the abstract of Resnik ( 1999 ) and 5 selected sentences that cite it in AAN. We notice that citing sentences contain additional factoids that are not in the abstract, not only ones that summarize the in the Table).

Previous work has explored this research direction. Qazvinian and Radev ( 2008 ) proposed a method for summarizing scientific articles by building a similarity network of the sentences that cite it, and then applying network analysis techniques to find a set of sentences that covers as much of the paper factoids as possible. Qazvinian et al. ( 2010 ) proposed another summarization method that first extracts a number of important keyphrases from the set of citing sentences, and then finds the best subset of sentences that covers as many key phrases as possible.

These works focused on analyzing the citing sentences and selecting a representative subset that covers the different aspects of the summarized article. In recent work, Abu-Jbara and Radev ( 2011b ) raised the issue of coherence and readability in summaries generated from citing sentences. They added pre-processing and post-processing steps to the summarization pipeline. In the pre-processing step, they use a supervised classification approach to rule out irrelevant sentences or fragments of sentences. In the post-processing step, they improve the summary coherence and readability by reordering the sentences, removing extraneous text (e.g. redundant mentions of author names and publication year).

Mohammad et al. ( 2009 ) went beyond single paper summarization. They investigated the usefulness of directly summarizing citation texts in the automatic creation of technical surveys. They generated surveys from a set of Question Answering (QA) and Dependency Parsing (DP) papers, their abstracts, and their citation texts. The evaluation of the generated surveys shows that both citation texts and abstracts have unique survey-worthy information. It is worth noting that all the aforementioned research on citation-based summarization used the ACL Anthology Network (AAN) for evaluation.
 7.5 Finding subject experts Finding experts in a research area is an important subtask in finding reviewers for publications. We show that using the citation network and the metadata associated with each paper, one can easily find subject experts in any research area.
As a proof-of-concept, we performed a simple experiment to find top authors in the following 3 areas  X  X  X ummarization X  X ,  X  X  X achine Translation X  X  and  X  X  X ependency Parsing X  X . We chose the above three areas because they are some of the most important areas in Natural Language Processing (NLP). We shortlisted papers in each area by searching for papers whose title match the area name. Then we found the top authors by total number of incoming citations to these papers alone. Table 13 lists the top 10 authors in each research area. 7.6 h-index: incoming citations relationship We performed a simple experiment to find the relationship between the total number of incoming citations and h-index. For the experiment, we chose all the authors who have an h -index score of at least 1. We fit a linear function and a quadratic function to the data by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. The fitted curves are shown in Fig. 5 . We also measured the goodness of the fit using the sum of the squared residuals. The sum of squared residuals for the quadratic function is equal to 8,240.12 whereas for the linear function it is equal to 10,270.37 which shows that a quadratic function fits the data better as compared to the linear function. Table 14 lists the top 10 outliers for the quadratic function. 7.6.1 Implications of the quadratic relationship The quadratic relationship between the h-index and total incoming citations adds evidence to the existence of power law in the number of incoming citations (Radev et al. 2009a ). It shows that as authors become more successful as shown by higher h-indices they attract more incoming citations. This phenomenon is also known as  X  X  X he rich get richer X  X  and  X  X  X referential attachment X  X  effect. 7.7 Citation context In Qazvinian and Radev ( 2010 ), the corpus is used for extracting context information for citations from scientific articles. Although the citation summaries have been used successfully for automatically creating summaries of scientific publications in Qazvinian and Radev ( 2008 ), additional information consisting of citation context information would be very useful for generating summaries. They report that citation context information in addition to the citation summaries are useful in creating better summaries. They define sentences which contain information about a cited paper but do not explicitly contain the citation as context sentences. For example, consider the following sentence citing (Eisner 1996 ).
 This approach is one of those described in Eisner ( 1996 ).

This sentence does not contain any information which can be used for generating summaries. Whereas the surrounding sentences do contain information as follows, ... In an all pairs approach, every possible pair of two tokens in a sentence is considered and some score is assigned to the possibility of this pair having a (directed) dependency relation. Using that information as building blocks, the parser then searches for the best parse for the sentence. This approach is one of those described in Eisner ( 1996 ) ...

They model each sentence as a random variable whose value determines its state (context sentence or explicit citation) with respect to the cited paper. They use Markov Random Fields (MRF), a type of graphical model, to perform inference over these random variables. Also, they provide evidence for the usefulness of such citation context information in the generation of surveys of broad research areas. Incorporating context extraction into survey generation is done in Qazvinian and Radev ( 2010 ). They use the MRF technique to extract context information from the datasets used in Mohammad et al. ( 2009 ) and show that the surveys generated using the citations as well as context information are better than those generated using abstracts or citations alone. Figure 6 shows a portion of the survey generated from the QA context corpus. This example shows how context sentences add meaningful and survey-worthy information along with citation sentences. 7.8 Temporal analysis of citations The interest in studying citations stems from the fact that bibliometric measures are commonly used to estimate the impact of a researcher X  X  work (Borgman and Furner 2002 ; Luukkonen 1992 ). Several previous studies have performed temporal analysis of citation links (Amblard et al. 2011 ; Mazloumian et al. 2011 ; Redner 2005 ) to see how the impact of research and the relations between research topics evolve overtime. These studies focused on observing how the number of incoming citations to a given article or a set of related articles change over time. However, the number of incoming citations is often not the only factor that changes with time. We believe that analyzing the text of citing sentences allows researchers to observe the change in other dimensions such as the purpose of citation, the polarity of citations, and the research trends. The following subsections discuss some of these dimensions.
Teufel et al. ( 2006 ) have shown that the purpose of citation can be determined by analyzing the text of citing sentences. We hypothesize that performing a temporal analysis of the purpose for citing a paper gives a better picture about its impact. As a proof of concept, we annotated all the citing sentences in AAN that cite the top 10 cited papers from the 1980s with citation purpose labels. The labels we used for annotation are based on Teufel et al. X  X  annotation scheme and are described in Table 15 . We counted the number of times the paper was cited for each purpose in each year since its publication date. Figure 7 shows the change in the ratio of each purpose with time for Shieber X  X  ( 1985 ) work on parsing.

The bibliometric measures that are used to estimate the impact of research are often computed based on the number of citations it received. This number is taken as a proxy for the relevance and the quality of the published work. It, however, ignores the fact that citations do not necessarily always represent positive feedback. Many of the citations that a publication receives are neutral citations, and citations that represent negative criticism are not uncommon. To validate this intuition, we annotated about 2,000 citing sentences from AAN for citation polarity. We found that only 30 % of citations are positive, 4.3 % are negative, and the rest are neutral. In another published study, Athar ( 2011 ) annotated 8,736 citations from AAN with their polarity and found that only 10 % of citations are positive, 3 % are negative and the rest were all neutral. We believe that considering the polarity of citations when conducting temporal analysis of citations gives more insight about how the way a published work is perceived by the research community over time. As a proof of concept, we annotated the polarity of citing sentences for the top 10 cited papers in AAN that were published in the 1980s. We split the year range of citations into two-year slots and counted the number of positive, negative, and neutral citations that each paper received during that time slot. We observed how the ratios of each category changed overtime. Figure 8 shows the result of this analysis when applied to the work of Church ( 1988 ) on part-of-speech tagging. 7.9 Text classification We chose a subset of papers in 3 topics (Machine Translation, Dependency Parsing, and Summarization) from the ACL anthology. These topics are three main research areas in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Specifically, we collected all papers which were cited by papers whose titles contain any of the following phrases,  X  X  X ependency Parsing, X  X   X  X  X achine Translation, X  X   X  X  X ummarization. X  X  From this list, we removed all the papers which contained any of the above phrases in their title because this would make the classification task easy. The pruned list contains 1,190 papers. We manually classified each paper into four classes (Dependency Parsing, Machine Translation, Summarization, Other) by considering the full text of the paper. The manually cleaned data set consists of 275 Machine Translation papers, 73 Dependency Parsing papers and 32 Summarization papers for a total of 380 papers. Table 16 lists a few papers from each area.

This data set is slightly different from other text classification data sets in the sense that there are many relational features that are provided for each paper, like textual information, citation information, authorship information, venue informa-tion. Recently, There has been a lot of interest in computing better similarity measures for objects by using all the features  X  X  X ogether X  X  (Zhou et al. 2008 ). Since it is very hard to evaluate similarity measures directly, they are evaluated extrinsically using a task for which a good similarity measure directly yields better performance, such as classification. 7.10 Summarizing 30 years of ACL discoveries using citing sentences The ACL Anthology Corpus contains all the proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL) since 1979. All the ACL papers and their citation links and citing sentences are included in the ACL Anthology Network (ACL). In this section, we show how citing sentences can be used to summarize the most important contributions that have been published in the ACL conference since 1979. We selected the most cited papers in each year and then manually picked a citing sentence that cites a top cited and describes it contribution. It should be noted here that the citation counts we used for ranking papers reflect the number of incoming citations the paper received only from the venues included in AAN. To create the summary, we used citing sentences that cite the same paper at the beginning of the sentence. This is because such citing sentences are often high-quality, concise summaries of the cited work. Table 17 shows the summary of the ACL conference contributions that we created using citing sentences.
 8 Conclusion We introduced the ACL Anthology Network (AAN), a manually curated Anthology built on top of the ACL Anthology. AAN, which includes 4 decades of published papers in the field of Computational Linguistics in the ACL community, provides valuable resources for researchers working on various tasks related to scientific data, text, and network mining. These resources include the citation and collaboration networks of more than 18,000 papers from more than 14,000 authors. Moreover AAN includes valuable statistics such as author h-index and PageRank scores. Other manual annotations in AAN include author gender and affiliation annotations, and citation sentence extraction.
 In addition to AAN, we also motivated and discussed several different uses of AAN and citing sentences in particular. We showed that citing sentences can be used to analyze the dynamics of research and observe how it trends. We also gave examples on how analyzing the text of citing sentences can give a better understanding of the impact of a researcher X  X  work and how this impact changes over time. In addition, we presented several different applications that can benefit from AAN such as scientific literature summarization, identifying controversial arguments, and identifying relations between techniques, tools and tasks. We also showed how citing sentences from AAN can provide high-quality data for Natural Language Processing tasks such as information extraction, paraphrase extraction, and machine translation. Finally, we used AAN citing sentences to create a citation-based summary of the important contributions included in the ACL conference publication in the past 30 years. The ACL Anthology Network is available to download. The files included in the downloadable package are as follows.  X  Text files of the paper: The raw text files of the papers after converting them  X  Metadata: This file contains all the metadata associated with each paper. The  X  Citations: The paper citation network indicating which paper cites which other  X  Database Schema: We have pre-computed the different statistics and stored
We also include a large set of scripts which use the paper citation network and the metadata file to output the auxiliary networks and the different statistics. 5 The data set has already been downloaded from 6,930 unique IPs since June 2007. Also, the website has been very popular based on access statistics. There have been nearly 1.1 M hits between April 1, 2009 and March 1, 2010. Most of the hits were searches for papers or authors.
 Finally, in addition to AAN, we make Clairlib publicly available to download. 6 The Clairlib library is a suite of open-source Perl modules intended to simplify a number of generic tasks in natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and network analysis (NA). Clairlib is in most part developed to work with AAN. Moreover, all of AAN statistics including author and paper network statistics are calculated using the Clairlib library. This library is available for public use for motivated experiments in Sect. 8 as well as to replicate various network statistics in AAN.

As a future direction, we plan to extend AAN to include related conferences and journals including AAAI, SIGIR, ICML, IJCAI, CIKM, JAIR, NLE, JMLR, IR, JASIST, IPM, KDD, CHI, NIPS, WWW, TREC, WSDM, ICSLP, ICASSP, VLDB, and SIGMOD. This corpus, which we refer to as AAN ? , includes citations within and between AAN and these conferences. AAN ? includes 35,684 papers, with a citation network of 24,006 nodes and 113,492 edges.
