Most works actually lack a formal methodology for evaluating the results produced by their theories. tative, reproducible and generalizable results.

In this work, we aim to overcome this shortcoming, by establishing a principled framework that is capable of evaluating the community. Internally, our framework encompasses five conditions that should be satisfied by a prominent group with real influence over the other members of the community. These conditions can be summarized as follows: 1. real influencers comprise a small subset of the community, overall activity, 4. their activity that is relevant to this metric chronologically precedes that of their peer community members, and takes into account.

Conditions 1, 2 and 5 actually correspond to the pre-processing requirements of our framework. Their goal is to ensure lying community. These are fundamental prerequisites for drawing safe conclusions from the analysis performed by our performance, the one that exhibits higher correlation with the rest of the community is preferred.
Given that all five conditions rely on objectively measurable metrics, our framework allows for comparing the perfor-benchmark dataset that consists of real-world data. We actually draw our data from Twitter, 7 months. Hence, it is suitable for performing large-scale qualitative and quantitative analyses with our framework. widely used in the literature.

Similar they benefit from their individual merits.
 On the whole, the main contributions of our work are the following: text of any social network.

We analyze the performance of the selected influence theories through a novel methodology that provides insights into their functionality and the dynamics of the prominent groups they define.

We further analyze the performance of the selected influence theories, by introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that classifies influence theories according to their scope and the influence metric(s) they employ. We apply it to the main influence theories for Twitter, but it is general enough to accommodate theories for any other social network. with respect to the five conditions of our framework and in Section 5 , we introduce a novel methodology for analyzing 2.

In the following, we first examine the main influence theories for Twitter, organizing them in a two-dimensional taxon-omy. Then, we go more in depth on three additional topics that are closely related to their development and use. 2.1. Influence theories

The metric of an influence theory determines the type of information it takes into account when assessing the influence exerted by a specific user. This dimension distinguishes influence theories into the following categories: graph criteria, such as indegree, node centrality and betweeness.
 Contentual influence theories assess the influence of a user judging exclusively from the textual content she produces. consider the number of retweets and the number of mentions pertaining to an individual user.

We examine this idea in the context of topic communities through the Random Influence Theory that is presented in Sec-(cf. Section 3.3 ), when restricted in the borders of a topic community.

Section 3.3 ), adapted, though, to the local settings of topic communities. user interactions and user profiles. The former include the number of retweets, the number of replies and the number of topic-specific analysis.

In Tan and et al. (2010) , the authors proposed a Noise Tolerant Time-varying Factor Graph Model (NTT-FGM) for modeling heterogeneous social networks and was found to consistently outperform the baseline methods.
The relationship between those two types of influence was examined using data extracted from Wikipedia, with the out-comes confirming the hypothesis of a direct link between them. 2.3. Applications of influence theories through word-of-mouth advertising.

In Domingos and Richardson (2001) , the authors viewed the market as a social network that can be modeled as a Markov provided approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. This work has been the basis of several more recent studies on the subject.

On another line of research, Cha et al. examined influence dynamics in Twitter and discovered that the top influential spread of information can be maximized by targeting a small number of opinion leaders. Their findings are in accordance campaigns should target a large number of plain users in order to be successful. topology characteristics, such as degree distribution, along with the word-of-mouth influence stemming from neighboring nodes. 2.4. Homophily vs. social influence &amp; Mahdian, 2008; Aral, Muchnik, &amp; Sundararajan, 2009; Fond &amp; Neville, 2010 ).
Other works have examined the dynamics of social influence with respect to homophily. In Holme and Newman (2006) , controlled through a single parameter. The authors studied how homophily-based and influence-based dynamics affect the work data. Their outcomes demonstrate that the importance of individual attributes in forming links changes over time. 3. Problem formulation framework. 3.1. Twitter overview
Twitter constitutes one of the most popular micro-blogging services, encompassing a user base of more than 500 million registered users that post more than 340 million short messages per day. ularity are the unique characteristics that lie at its core: and time from their readers. Thus, tweets can be easily understood, memorized and shared with other people, strongly resembling marketing slogans. (e.g., a hobby) or because of content quality (e.g., news services).

Also crucial for the success of Twitter are the usage patterns that were established by its users: or more words or alphanumerics concatenated together (e.g., #twitter ). Hashtags can be used, therefore, to identify groups of people that are interested in the same topic. tation is called mention and allows for detecting users that are engaged into bilateral discussions. more influential it is ( Bakshy et al., 2011 ).
 them from our analysis; they are quite rare, though, comprising just 1423 tweets out of the 6 million messages of our benchmark communities (cf. Table 2 ).
It is worth stressing at this point that more advanced methods have been proposed in the literature for automatically detecting the sentiment of a tweet in a more comprehensive way  X  the interested reader can refer to ( Tsytsarau &amp;
Palpanas, 2012 ) for more details. However, applying a more elaborate classification scheme for sentiment analysis lies to overcome the inherent challenges of the user-generated content posted in Twitter ( Giannakopoulos et al., 2012 ): 1. High levels of noise in the form of spelling mistakes and missing or incorrect information. 2. Sparsity, as the size limitations minimize the information conveyed by individual messages. there are no metadata to indicate it or to facilitate its automatic identification. 4. Evolving, non-standard vocabulary, in the form of slang words and dialects that are commonly used in the casual com-munication between OSN users.
 the literature for building the ground-truth of polarized content ( Go, Bhayani, &amp; Huang, 2010 ). 3.2. Basic definitions quent sections, we first summarize the main notation they use in Table 1 .

The members of Twitter and the connections between them are typically modeled through a graph. Each user is repre-sented by a node, and every relationship between two users is denoted by an edge connecting the corresponding nodes. In Plugging these two abstractions together, we formally define the social graph of Twitter as follows:
Definition 3.1. The social graph of Twitter is a graph G T u e V T with the messages she has posted: M ( u )={ h m , u , t i }.
 with their authors and the time they were posted. More formally: works in the field: in Ernesto and et al. (2012) , the authors use hashtags as surrogates for topics, in Pal and Counts its authors. More formally: graph G h ={ V h , E h , N }, where N ( h ) is the set of topic metadata, V message with the label h (i.e., V h ={ u e V T : M ( u ) \ N ( h )  X  0} and E contained in V h (i.e., E h ={ h u 1 , u 2 i e E T : u 1 e V referred to as the size of the community and is denoted by | V rather passive, while others excel in some aspect of the community, affecting the behavior of other members and setting group . Formally, this group is defined as follows:
Definition 3.3. Given a topic community G h , its prominent group is a sub-graph G prominent users contained in V h , E p is the set of the edges between them in E prominent group is called prominent size .

Note that for simplicity, the overall metadata of a prominent group G
Note also that we generalize this notation to any (sub-)community G ing, we use the term (sub-)community in order to collectively refer to an entire topic community and to its prominent groups. 3.3. Local influence theories
A local influence theory is a formal model that aims at detecting the influencers inside a topic community. To this she has within the community. After mapping users to a scale of influence ratio, an influence theory sorts them in descending order, and those placed at the top k ranking positions form the community X  X  k-prominent group  X  symbol-ized by G p @ k .
 More formally, a local influence theory is defined as follows:
Definition 3.4. Given a topic community G h ,a local influence theory is a mapping of its members V
O , which assigns an influence ratio to each member u e V h order according to the following implication: F ( u i , G the user u 1 in O h . The lower the ranking position o ( u corresponding to the most influential user.

Two points are worth clarifying with respect to this definition: information drawn from the entire community (e.g., her local indegree).

Any evidence that stems outside the topic community is ignored. For example, any external user u specific community member u i e G h is not considered in the local indegree of u scale evaluation: therefore, the same level of influence and are assigned to the same influence ratio: her node). More formally: with other members of the community. The more sociable a user is, the more people get in contact with her and the mentions that pertain to them: where e ( m , u l ) is a boolean function that returns true if tweet m mentions user u been reproduced by her peer members in the topic community. More formally: otherwise. of tweets on the topic she has posted on-line: their predictive accuracy. 3.4. Evaluation framework
The behavior of prominent users is rather crucial for a topic community, as their actions and opinions are imitated and propagated by a considerable part of their peer community members  X  even those out of their direct reach. This phenom-sponding behavior of influencers. To quantitatively measure its extent, we need to compare the aggregate activity of and formally define it as follows:

PR ( G l ) takes values in the interval ( | M ( G l )|,+| M ( G and positive tweets (i.e., | Neg ( G l )| | Pos ( G l )|), thus yielding values very close to 0.
Based on the notion of ASM and its instantiation through PR , we now introduce the formal definition of our large-scale tions for true influence exertion when they are satisfied in conjunction: (i) Correlation condition . The output of an ASM allows for estimating the proximity of prominent users X  behavior with an unequivocal way and, thus, PR ( G p ) and PR ( G h ) should share the same sign and similar magnitudes. (ii) Size condition . The relative size of the prominent group (i.e., | V (iv) Rate condition . Another important aspect of real influence exertion is the temporal relationship between ASM ( G
Given an ASM , we measure the relative rate of content production between two groups during a specific time interval [ t , t 2 ] through the cumulative activity curve, a metric that is defined as follows:
Definition 4.7. Given an ASM along with a (sub-)community G
Cumulative Activity Curve ( CAC ) quantifies the production rate of the content in G follows:

In our settings that rely on PR , CAC expresses how fast the polarized content of a community G was produced during the time interval [ t 1 , t 2 ].

 On the whole, the rate condition for real influence exertion is formulated as:

Problem 1. Given an ASM along with a topic community G h that was active during the time interval [ t influence theory identifies as prominent group a subset G The stronger these conditions hold, the more effective is the influence theory.

Note that the above definition is generic enough to accommodate a wide variety of activity summary metrics. For the should be applied only in case the other requirements hold for the prominent group(s) at hand. In fact, the first three conditions filter out prominent groups that are incompatible with our evaluation framework; we cannot draw safe conclu-inating the overall or the metric-specific content of the community. The same applies to prominent groups that have not posted any relevant content for the selected ASM metric. In Section 4 , we adhere to this execution order when applying our framework to the above influence theories. 4. Evaluation of local influence theories different settings.

We additionally impose the following constraints in order to ensure that the communities we consider are large enough to draw safe conclusions 7 : it contains more than 5000 distinct tweets, it comprises more than 500 users, it entails more than 500 polarized tweets.

Our content dataset contains more than 49 million of tweets marked with at least one hashtag, which correspond to around 3 million distinct topics, in total. Among them, 728 communities satisfy all the aforementioned constraints.
To select the most vibrant ones, we ranked them in descending order of the average number of tweets posted by each member. The higher this number is, the more active the individual members are expected to be. We then selected the top 100 ranking hashtags and carefully examined their content to ensure that they define real topic communities.

Their technical characteristics are presented in Table 2 . On average, every test-bed community was active for over 6 months and comprised almost 9000 distinct members. Approximately half of these users are also included in the dataset
Each community member individually posted more than 8 tweets on average. Content-wise, every community corresponds outnumber the positive ones in 1/3 of all communities. 4.2. Volume conditions This section investigates the performance of the selected influence theories with respect to the two volume conditions.
We start with the metric volume condition, which measures the portion of polarized content per topic community that stems from the prominent users defined by each influence setting. three major categories: volume condition (i.e., 0&lt;| M ( G p , ASM , t 1 , t 2 )|) and cannot exert any real influence.
Hyperactive prominent groups monopolize the polarized content of a community, producing a disproportionately high vol-ume of positive and negative tweets. The metric volume condition does not hold for them, since their influence comes at an excessively high cost. In this study, we instantiated the second part of the metric volume condition as:
This means that we consider a prominent group as hyperactive if it produces more than 25% of the overall polarized con-rest of the community members.
 Valid prominent groups are neither inactive nor hyperactive, thus satisfying the metric volume condition. from every community.

We observe that the inactive prominent groups are rather scarce, as they merely appear in a dozen of topic communities the increase in k increases the portion of hyperactive groups. In the case of F inent sizes up to 50, but become the majority for k = 100. The relation between the mean and the median values actually topic communities into valid and hyperactive ones.

Out of the 75 topic communities considered in our study, 30 of them consistently satisfy both volume performance of F ind . 4.3. Correlation condition
The goal of this section is to investigate to which extent the aggregate sentiment of prominent groups matches that of ing user groups. In fact, our goal is to estimate the correlation between PR ( G for all influence settings.

To this end, we first defined two variables for every influence theory F of the corresponding prominent groups over the 30 valid topic communities, while Y remaining community members. We then estimated the Pearson correlation coefficient ence settings.

The results of our analysis are presented in Table 5 . A detailed breakdown of PR ( G the influence settings we are considering is given in Appendix A . Note that for F sidered the same 1000 random samples of k users from every community that were used in the previous section. small prominent groups are less accurate in predicting the overall mood of their peers. where F mnt exhibits an even lower correlation.

Internal analysis of local influence theories inent users: (i) their homophily, as inferred from the reciprocal links among them, (ii) their affinity, in terms of the frequency of their communication, and most influence theories. 5.1. Homophily community members are not necessarily linked with explicit edges on the social graph. In fact, the links in E mon than just the interest in topic h . In the same vein, reciprocal links ily , i.e., similar personal backgrounds in socially significant ways ( Weng et al., 2010 ).
The goal of this section is to examine the levels of homophily that are shared by the prominent users of each influence theory. We can infer this information from the topology of E a prominent group G p is defined as follows: summarized in Table 7 .

Note that for F rnd and for every prominent size, we repeated our measurements over the same 1000 random samples that lies close to 5% and the mean one close to 6% in all cases. Therefore, the prominent users defined by F levels of homophily.

Regarding F ind , we notice that its prominent groups exhibit substantially lower levels of reciprocity than F indicates that the most popular users inside a topic community typically share little common background.
In contrast, the reciprocity values of F mnt , F rtw , and F k = 100, the reciprocity of these three theories actually gets rather close to F
This implies that members of large prominent groups share the same average levels of homophily as any random pair of is degenerated.

On the whole, we can conclude that the prominent groups of F up to 50, forming prominent groups with a densely connected graph structure. This applies neither to F regardless of the prominent size. 5.2. Affinity
This section seeks to measure the affinity among prominent users, i.e., the extent to which they know each other and community. To quantify this idea, we employ the following two measures:
Definition 6.1. Given a topic community G h and its prominent group G
Definition 6.2. Given a topic community G h and its prominent group G

Both metrics are defined in the interval [0, 100], with higher values corresponding to more frequent interactions among influencers. Therefore, the higher these probabilities are, the stronger is the affinity between the prominent users.
We calculated these probabilities over all topic communities for the usual influence settings. For F usual 1000 groups of k random users per topic community. Note that, by definition, there is a strong bias between P

For P im , F rtw takes values 10% to 20% lower than the maximum ones (i.e., those of the tautology of F ilar pattern is exhibited for P ir , where F mnt lies within 10% of the tautology of F ity, as prominent users are more likely to refer to a fellow influencer than to any other member of their community. bridging the gap with F mnt and F rtw to some extent. Nevertheless, their values for both P on them. In general, we expect that the more members a community encompasses, the lower is the probability for a prom-ger prominent sizes. This pattern applies to all influence theories for both P

On the whole, we can conclude that the influencers of F mnt erences to each other, especially for prominent sizes larger than k = 20. In contrast, the prominent users of F cally no ties between them, unless large prominent sizes are considered. Finally, F moderate affinity that increases in proportion with k .

We start with the pair of theories that corresponds to the highest similarity, namely F inent size. In most of the cases, their median overlap is equal to the average of the minimum and the maximum ones, a
On the other hand, the lowest similarity consistently corresponds to F communities, the overlap of the prominent groups remains rather low, taking a maximum value of 20% and a mean one of community members. This means that popular users do no need to overwhelm the community with large volumes of con-tent in order to ensure their high levels of influence.

In the middle of these two extremes lie the overlaps of F numbers, the mean overlap fluctuates between 12% and 18%, with the higher values corresponding to higher prominent prominent sizes, are also consistent with earlier evidence that was derived after examining the relations between F 5.4. Discussion The outcomes of our internal analysis suggest that influence theories can be distinguished into three main categories. influencers, enabling them to maximize their influence and to achieve high performance with respect to our evaluation framework.

Starting with #iranelection , we observe that the prominent group of F and activists, the majority of whom is Iranian. The prominent group defined by F agencies and journalists/political bloggers. The influencers of F dom users and seemingly unrelated celebrities. The prominent group of F are selected as influencers by all theories, except for F (including oxfordgirl and persiankiwi ) also appear in the prominent groups of relevant topics, such as #neda .
For #noh8 , we observe that F ind , F mnt and F rtw contain an equal mix of celebrities and random users along with few moment, a strong indication that they exhibited spamming or marketing behavior. It is also worth mentioning that there is no overlap between the prominent groups of the two topic communities across all influence theories.
