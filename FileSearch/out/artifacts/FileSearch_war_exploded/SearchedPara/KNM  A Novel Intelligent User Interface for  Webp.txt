 With the explosion of the amount of web pages, readers do not have enough time to Automatic text summarization [6], which can extract the key phrases or sentences from the webpage, has become an effective tool to solve such a problem. Recently, Some research works of summarization are on how to organize the key phrases ex-tracted from the webpage in order to make them better assist reader navigation [1],[4]. Many research works are on how to present and organize the location information of the text in document, such as scrollbar [2], and profileskim [3] etc. Therefore, we believe that the positions of the key phrases in a page are rather significant for readers to search their interested information. And We propose a novel user interface called the Keyphrase Navigation Map (KNM) in order to help readers understand the result generated by automatic summarization system. 
The inspiration of designing KNM is from the overview map in some battle com-puter games, such as Ages of Empires. The overview map of the game can help player rapidly realize the runtime development of enemy and friend army, and it can also keyphrase map is a good way to present the position information of keyphrase to readers (see Fig. 1). The map can be pasted with a background of the thumbnail of the original webpage, and the keyphrase tags are located on the map according to its rela-tive position in the original webpage. The reader can select his/her interested key-phrase by virtue of the position of the keyphrase in the page and the background thumbnail. From the map readers can build an overview of the webpage content not only from keyphrase itself but also from keyphrase positions and the background. In essence, the KNM which lets reader participate in the selec-tion of the results of sum-marization, is a trade-off between time and accuracy. The architecture graph of KNM is shown in Fig. 2. The beginning of data flow is Webpage, and the end of the flow is readers' browser. The core components of KNM are three engines: (1) KEX engine, which is the main engine of them, can extract the keyphrases from the webpage by statistical method. KEX engine can not only extract keyphrases but also rank these keyphrases by their score. (2) Cluster Engine, which clusters the keyphrases by phrase relevancy into several topical groups. The phrases relevancy is determined not only by the component words of the phrases but also the position information of phrase. (3) Map Engine, which receives the clustered key-phrases and position of the phrases, draws the salient keyphrases from the topical group on the thumbnail in suitable position. 3.1 Kex Keyphrase Extraction is a task in which a set of words or phrases are extracted from a given webpage, which are most indicative of the content of the webpage. There are three components in the Keyphrase Extraction algorithm: (1) Webpage content acquisition. Keyphrase extraction algorithm directly works on (2) Keyphrases generation. This component is to generate candidate keyphrases (3) Ranking. A Candidate Key Phrase Set (CKS) consists of all selected Keywords 3.2 Clustering of Keyphrase The keyphrases extracted and ranked by KEX Engine will be sent to Cluster Engine with their hot score. Then the Cluster Engine begins to cluster those keyphrases into several topical groups. Therefore it must be a criterion about how to evaluate the relevancy between phrases. In our Cluster Engine, two phrases are relevant if two phrases have the same common word or they are in the same segment of the webpage. Cluster Engine splits each keyphrase into several words and stems [5] these words before they are compared. 
Each keyphrase sent by KEX Engine all have their rank scores. The Cluster Engine the scores of keyphrases in each group. So our algorithm must take the rank order of the keyphrases into account. The keyphrase with the highest score must be in the first keyphrase topical group, and other keyphrases relevant to the keyphrase are added into the group. Then it begins to build the second group, the first element added to the group is the keyphrase which has the highest score in the set of key-phrases have not been added to other groups. 3.3 Keyphrase Position Because the more frequently the phrase appears in the webpage the more probability it become a keyphrase. Therefore, the unique position of each keyphrase must be configured before clustering and displaying . It is obvious that the KNM needs to select the most representative position for each keyphrase. The strategy in KNM is : if the keyphrase appears in the title of a webpage or segment, the postion of the title will be selected as the Representative Position(RP) of the keyphrase; if the keyphrases occurs in title twice or above, then compare the times of keyphrase occurrence in each containing the keyphrase, then it will select the position of the segment of which the keyphrase occurrence is the highest as the RP of the keyphrase. If the absolute RP of the keyphrase in webpage is ( x 0 , y 0 ), the width and height of the webpage are W D and H is: ) , ( 0 0 In order to testify the feasibility of KNM, we build a prototype system of KNM on 1. For example, when the KNM navigates the portal website of BUC, the sub-window of web browser will display the webpage but it won't display the full web page be-cause of the limited size of the browser window. Then the Navigation Map in the right sub-window will display the thumbnail of the full page and some key-phrases tags after keyphrases extraction and clustering. The Fig. 3 is an enlarged picture of the Navigation Map. There are four keyphrase tags shown in the Fig. 3 namely, "under-grad", "campus", "student", "prospective students". These keyphrases are the salient keyphrases of each topical group. The KNM selects four or five groups to display on the thumbnail according to their precise ph rase position and each topic always con-tains not more than 5 keyphrases because the keyphrases tag will be easily overlapped if there are too many keyphrases displayed at the same time. Then readers can select reader clicks the keyphrase tag "prospective students" in the Fig. 3. When readers order to help readers navigate the keyphrases of other groups. 
Usability test is regarded as a key step in user-centered design. There are 20 col-lege participants (consists of 7 male and 13 female English Department students) in navigation to navigate 10 webpages selected from web randomly: (1) the web browser without any summarization (NB); (2) Keyphrases Navigation List (KNL), which does their keyphrase salience score; (3) Keyphrases Navigation Map (KNM). 
Each time when a participant finishes reading a webpage, he or she will be asked to give a score to the inter-face he or she just has used in navigating the webpage. The average score of the KNM is better than that of the KNL, and this result proves that the position information given by the map can indeed help readers understand the keyphrases by summarization more effectively. And we also find that the average score of the KNM and KNL are better than that of NB, which proves that the KEX algorithm is workable. Further study the rating result of KNM, we find that the KNM will work more effectively when it navigates the webpage with long text segment than that of Homepage. In this paper, a novel model of user interface: Keyphrase Navigation Map(KNM) is proposed. The KNM is mainly composed of KEX engine, Cluster engine and Map engine. The usability test proves that the KNM which presents an overview of the corresponding web page to readers can really help them to find information they are interested in effectively.For the future work of the KNM, we plan to do further re-search on the key-phrase position selection, we want to know whether showing dou-ble or more position of the keyphrase can give reader more information when the keyphrase appeared in the webpage twice or more needs future research; and we also plan to add zooming support to our present user interface.
