In this pa per, w e pr opos e a visual da ta m ining framework for fast ide ntification of actiona ble know ledge. It is inspire d by the House of Quality. The visualization displays a matrix of rich information, which enables the user to easily and quickly focus on opportunities, i.e., potentially actionable knowledge. This framework fits the following general scenario: The user wants to find (actionable) rules or patterns that can be used to solve his/her application problems. Typically in such an application, each data record has a class label. Some classes are important as they represent important real-life problems, e.g., product problems or issues that need to be addressed. In these applications, the user is not interested in prediction or classification, but rather in rules or patterns that can be used to deal with existing i ssues. In this framework, the identification of actionable rules is regarded as a post-processing step; it assumes that rules have been generated. The framework can also be used to guide the generation of rules in comparative study, as we will explain later in this paper. The concepts in our data mining setting can be readily mapped to concepts in the House of Quality. Customer requirements correspond to the target classes that the user is interested in. A company X  X  technical requirements in the House of Quality can be mapped to the set of attributes in the data. The combination of the above two concepts forms a two-dimensional matrix. Each cell in the matrix relates a class value to a particular attribute. The relationships between classes and attributes can be expressed in various forms, e.g., rules, distributions of data with regard to certain attributes and classes, etc. In the proposed framework, we are mainly concerned with rules. Our visualization enables the user to quickly determine important classes and actionable attributes and values, and to identify opportunities, i.e., actionable rules that can help solve his/her problems. The Opportunity Map also allows the user to focus on classes and the values of a particular attribute. A novel method for comparative study of rules from different subsets of data is also proposed, thereby enabling the user to perform more detailed studies resulting in more interesting and actionable knowledge. The proposed visual data mining with Opportunity Map involves: 1. Mining rules from the data, from where we get rules, classes 2. Visualizing the rules using the Opportunity Map. 3. Based on the user X  X  application and focus, arranging the map 4. Identifying interesting spots in th e specific area, i.e., attributes 5. Drilling down to a particular attribute and classes to find more 6. Performing comparative study, if needed. In the comparative All these steps can be performed in an iterative manner. Actionable rules are often identified in Steps 5 and 6. Our work makes the following contributions: 1. To our knowledge, this is th e first attempt to study rule 2. Ideas from Quality Function Deployment in management 3. It not only enables flexible and interactive analysis of Our proposed visual data mining system, Opportunity Map, displays a rich set of informati on, enabling the user to identify potential opportunities easily. We have used the system in applications with real-life and large-scale datasets from our industrial partner Motorola. The results show that the system is very promising. It helps to fi nd truly interesting and actionable rules from a large number of generated rules. Due to the success, Motorola X  X  technology transfer team is working to make Opportunity Map a tool for product reviews and ongoing decision-making by new product designers and managers. Our research is related to three main areas of data mining: interestingness, rule query, and vi sualization. Below, we review the existing literature in these areas and compare it with our work. Rule interestingness analysis aims to evaluate the interestingness of discovered rules. As we have discussed in the introduction section, little work has been done on finding actionable rules. Opportunity Map aims to perform the task using an interactive visualization system. [22] proposes to build an expert system to find actionable rules for an application. However, build ing an expert system is a major undertaking, which is often more difficult than data mining itself. [1] proposes to organize all actions that the user can perform in a hierarchy. He/she then identifies actionable rules for each node (or action) in the hierarchy. However, finding actionable rules is actually the difficult part of the process as our application shows. Our proposed method aims to help the user find such rules. [17] removes some non-actionable rules, which is an objective analysis of interestingness. It does not find actionable rules for the user. Another type of data mining techniques allows the user to issue queries to a rule query system to re trieve rules that he/she wants to see [8][19][30]. However, one cannot issue a query to a system to find actionable rules if the user does not already know what actionable rules are. Opportunity Map helps the user to interactively identify actionable knowledge quickly. Regarding visualization, there are two general approaches, which differ in terms of what content is visualized and manipulated [13]. The first one is raw data visualization, and the second is data mining results visualization. Our proposed work is more related to the latter. For rule visualization, [9] proposes interactive mosaic plots to visualize the contingency tables of the association rules. In [7], classification rules are visualized using rule polygons. Each rule is displayed as a strip covering the area that encompasses its attribute value ranges. [32] introduces a method to visualize association rules without a fixed target. Its rules come from texts collections, and thus it visualizes how words are related. [ 33] v isualiz es the be havior of rules, i.e ., c hanges of suppor ts and conf ide nces ov er tim e. In [5], pa ralle l c oor dina tes are us ed to v isualiz e rules. T hese m ethods dif fer from our appr oach in te rms of both the goal and the visualiz ation. In [4], a 3D visualiz ation is pr opos ed to v isualiz e association rules by empha sizing the ir suppor ts and c onf ide nces. A lthoug h suppor t and c onf ide nce are im por tant, the y are not the key in finding actiona ble rules. In [12] , a pos t-processing environm ent is propos ed to brow se and v isualiz e association r ules. It pr ovide s a visualizat ion is focused on one su bset at a t ime. Histogram s are used to plot the suppor t a nd c onf ide nce value s. In [20] , im por tant rules in te rms of suppor t a nd c onf ide nce value s are hig hlig hte d with a grid view. How ever, it doe s not a ctiv ely he lp the use r find actiona ble know ledge. In [18] , or dering of categorical da ta is studie d in order to im prove the visua liz ation. T he purpose is to have less visua liz ation clutte r. It is mainly useful for pa ralle l c oor dina tes [33] [34] and othe r gen eral sp read sheet types o f vi sualizat ion. It is clearl y differen t from our work. All of the abov e appr oaches dif fer from our pr opos ed Oppor tunity Ma p. I t is also im por tant to note tha t Oppor tunity Ma p is not jus t a ru le vi sualizat ion sy stem , but a f ram ew ork an d a process for fast ide ntification of actiona ble know ledge. It is also able to perform rule comparativ e analysis, w hich turns out to be very use ful in our applic ation. This section pr esents the pr opos ed O ppor tunity Ma p f ramework. We first define the proble m tha t it a ims to solv e, and the n give a short introduc tion to the H ous e of Q uality f rom Q uality Engineeri ng research an d p ract ice.

Deci sion trees, na X ve Bay esian cl assi ficat ion (NB), an d SVM are less suita ble for the ta sk. B oth SVM a nd N B do not pr oduc e inte rpretable rules. D ecision tr ees only find a small s ubs et of rules, which are often long and ha rd to unde rstand a nd to us e, and may m iss m any act ionable ru les. Thus, they are less effect ive for expla ining the relations hips between attribute s and c lasses. T he aim he re is to f ind rule s tha t can he lp s olve real-world pr oble ms. For example , a N ew Produc t Introduc tion Eng ineer m ay want to find the relations hips be tween pr oduc t a ttribute s and abnor mal classes in r ecords of pr oduc t pe rformance da ta, the reby providing ins ights regarding how to m odif y the pr oduc t de sign and reduc e the abnor mal cases oc curring in f utur e pe rformance da ta.

When presen ted with su ch vi sualizat ion for this da ta se t, the Motorola engineers started a dis cussion of the pos sible relations hips for the spe cific attribute s and da ta, le ading to som e very use ful insig hts. For a cell, the us er can br ing up a de taile d r ule window to see the exact ru les, as sh own in Figu re 8 . The user the n is inte rested in pe rforming comparison of classes, and w ants to f ind out dif ferent dom ina ting attribute s and r ules for each class. This is made easy by sev eral b uilt-in so rtin g m ethods within the Oppor tunity Ma p. Fig ure 6 s how s the results of sorting on class2022. Fig ure 7 show s the results of sorting on c lass3303. The two visualiz ations indicat e that these t wo cl asses can b e ch aract eri zed b y very dif ferent a ttribute s, a s show n on X axis. When the Motor ola engineers w ere p resen ted w ith these vi sualizat ions, they looked thr oug h the se attribute s and r ules one by one , ba sed on the ir dom ain know ledge to e ithe r inte rpret the reasons , or formula te new hy pothe ses, w hich le ad to f urther detaile d inv estig ations (unf ortuna tely, we could not dis clos e the actions ). In Fig ure 6, it is nota ble tha t class2022 a nd c lass895 ha ve m any common r elated attribute s, e xcept for only a few, e.g., a ttribute 4604. T his le ads to the hypothe sis tha t the proble ms represented by the se tw o c lasses can be de alt w ith tog ethe r. In all the visua liz ation, dy namic link ing is prov ide d whenever the user points t o a ru le. F or exam ple, in F igu re 7 , the green bar points. If those at tributes are n ot so rted toget her, a m ouse click can position them ad jacen t to each other for a b etter vi ew . Fina lly , it w as found tha t in a drill dow n v isualiz ation (s im ila r to tha t in Fig ure 5) tha t one pr oduc t ha d m any m ore failur es related to a pr oble m class tha n anothe r pr oduc t. T his im media tely leads to a comparativ e study of the tw o pr oduc ts a s reque sted by a Motor ola engineer. Fig ure 9 s how s this c ase w ith rule s f rom the two produc ts. Red is for pr oduc t 1, a nd blue is for pr oduc t 2. Ea ch pair of ba rs represents one rule, i.e ., the conf ide nce (height) and suppor t (width) of the first ba r is for pr oduc t 1, a nd the conf ide nce and suppor t of the second ba r is for pr oduc t 2. W e can clearly see tha t R ules 1, 2, 3, a nd 5 indic ate m ore failur es for produc t 1 (higher supports). Rules 2, 4, and 5 indicate that given the same conditions, product 2 is much less likely to result in failure. The insights from these rules are immediately actionable, as engineers can review the entire set, study why these are cases and identify/propose possible design changes for product 2. In summary, Opportunity Map helps to find many pi eces of truly useful and actionable knowledge from a large set of discovered rules. Motorola technology transfer team is working to make the system a tool for their product reviews and ongoing decision-making by new product designers and managers. In this paper, we proposed the Opportunity Map visualization framework, and described its application for fast identification of actionable knowledge. This framework, which was inspired by the House of Quality from Industrial Engineering, visualizes the user X  X  needs, e.g., problem classes, and attributes that produce rules as a matrix. Opportunity Map clearly shows how attributes and their values are linked to th e important classes. Combined with actionable attributes, the user can quickly focus on useful rules (and interesting cells). With sophisticated cell visualization and comparative study, Opportunity Map represents a systematic way of post-analysis of discovered rules with convenient visualization support. In our applications with real-life, large-scale data sets from our industrial partner, it has been possible to find the truly interesting and useful rules and patterns from a large number of rules generated by data mining. Thus, the technology transfer team of our industrial partner is working to make the Opportunity Map a part of product reviews and ongoing decision-making by new product designers and managers.
