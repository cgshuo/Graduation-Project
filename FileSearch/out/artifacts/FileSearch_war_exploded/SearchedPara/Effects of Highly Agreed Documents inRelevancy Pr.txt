 Finding significant contextual features is a challenging task in the development of interactive information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper investigated a simple method to facil-itate such a task by looking at aggregated relevance judge-ments of retrieved documents. Our study suggested that the agreement on relevance judgements can indicate the effec-tiveness of retrieved documents as the source of significant features. The effect of highly agreed documents gives us prac-tical implication for the design of adaptive search models in interactive IR systems.

People disagree on the judgement of document relevancy [9]. However, the judgement of highly relevant documents are more likely to be agreed than that of partially relevant documents [8]. Therefore, when multiple judgements are available for document relevancy, the degree of relevance is likely to be indicated by the level of agreement on judge-ments. In other words, highly agreed documents can be seen as highly (non-)relevant documents.

In this paper, we hypothesise that highly agreed docu-ments can facilitate the mining of significant contextual fea-tures. We defined a contextual feature as a variable that increased an information retrieval (IR) system X  X  power of discriminating relevant documents from non-relevant ones. Therefore, one can measure the effect of contextual features based on the accuracy of document relevancy prediction. Finding significant contextual features has several implica-tions for the design of effective IR systems. In particular,  X

All CT 737 1045 49.5 50.5 we aimed to contribute to methodological advance for the development of context-aware interactive IR systems [5]. An effective way to elicit significant features from a wide range of potentially relevant factors can help us make an IR system adaptive to a search environment. This paper investigates an approach for facilitating the process of finding significant features based on aggregated relevance judgements made by searchers. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses our methodology to vary the level of agreement on relevance judgements to test our hypothesis. Section 3 presents the results of our experiment and dis-cusses the implications of highly agreed documents for the design of adaptive search models.
Our overall approach was to use machine learning tech-niques as a diagnostic tool to measure the effect of highly agreed documents in relevancy prediction. In the experi-ment, four well-known probabilistic classifiers [2, 10, 4, 7] were used to predict document relevancy. Unlike the work in [3, 1], we used multiple classifiers since a single classifier was unlikely to show the significance of potential features in a complex dependency structure. Our evaluation was based on experimental data collected in a laboratory-based user study with 24 participants searching for four different top-ics independently [6]. In each topic, they were given up to 15 minutes to complete a search session. Participants were asked to bookmark a document when perceived rel-evant information was found. Both the documents which participants visited from search results (i.e., click-through documents) and the bookmarked (BM) ones were used to form varied levels of agreement on document relevancy. The distribution of click-through (CT) data is shown in Table 1. As can be seen, a total of 1045 click-through actions were recorded on 737 unique documents. Of those, 58% of click-through were recorded on the documents which had a single click-through (CT=1). While the portion of relevance judgements varied over the frequency of click-through, the overall performance was approximately 50%. From the in-Category Example Size Object features 116 Visual HTML tags/att. tags No. of bold tags 17 Special HTML tags/att. tags No. of meta tags 24 Interaction Features Query Length 5 Table 3: Relevance aggregation method (NA: Neg-ative agreement, PA: Positive agreement) teraction with the 737 documents, we extracted a total of 121 candidate features and categorised them as shown in Table 2. Object features consisted of seven sub-categories , all of which extracted from click-through and bookmarked (BM) documents. Interaction features (Query Length, Rank of click-through URLs, Number of CT URLs so far, Time Spent so far and Number of queries submitted so far) were extracted from the transaction logs recorded by an experi-mental search interface.

To vary the level of agreement on document relevancy, we devised three conditions as shown in Table 3. We varied the level of agreement by increasing the amount of docu-ments discarded from the classifiers. The first ( C 1 ) was the most liberal condition where a document was judged (non-)relevant when more than half of click-through agreed . The documents which had a complete disagreement were removed in this condition. The second ( C 2 ) was the same as C 1 excepts the criterion of non-relevant documents was strengthened to a complete agreement. Finally, C 3 used the documents whose relevancy was completely agreed on both relevant and non-relevant judgements. The varied levels of relevance judgements were used to train the classifiers and the effect of agreement was measured by the performance of relevancy prediction. The results of relevancy prediction are shown in Table 4. For the object features, the average performance of seven sub-categories is presented for simplicity. Sub-sampling was performed to keep the portion of relevant and non-relevant documents equal for the analysis, thus, the baseline per-formance was 50% in the table. As can be seen, the ef-fect of highly agreed documents was little when all click-through documents were examined. This was consistent across the feature categories. However, a significant im-provement was found in the prediction accuracy when mul-tiple click-through documents were examined. In the object features, C 2 showed the best performance, suggesting that increasing the level of agreement for non-relevant documen ts Table 4: Performance of relevancy prediction com-pared to a baseline performance (50%).
 can be effective. On the other hand, the interaction features further benefited from the increased level of agreement for both side of judgements. This suggests that an optimal level of agreement can differ across the category of features.
The results of the experiment showed that the classifiers improved the accuracy of relevancy prediction when the leve l of agreement was increased. This demonstrates that highly agreed documents can facilitate the mining of significant contextual features. An implication of this in the design of adaptive search models is that aggregated relevance in-formation can be important for effective use of interaction data. For example, one can start to analyse the features of retrieved documents only when the frequency of click-through goes beyond a threshold. It is plausible that such a simple filtering can reduce the noise in the modelling of significant contexts. While this study was based on machine learning techniques, the finding might be applied to other approaches. Further investigation of our hypothesis is our future work. [1] E. Agichtein, et al.
