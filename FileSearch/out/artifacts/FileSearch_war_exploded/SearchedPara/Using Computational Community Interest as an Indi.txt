 Ranking documents in response to users' information needs is a challenging task, due, in part, to the dynamic nature of users' interests with respect to a query. I hypothesize that the interests of a given user are similar to the interests of the broader community of which he is a part and propose an innovative method that uses social media to characterize the interests of the community and generating a community interest vector (CIV) for a given query, we use community interest to alte r the ranking score of individual documents retrieved by the query. The CIV is based on a continuously updated set of recent (daily or past few hours) user-oriented text data. The user-oriente d data can be user blogs or user comment tagged news. Preliminar y evaluation shows that the new ranking method signifi cantly improves ranking performance. H.3.3 [Information Storage and Re trieval]: Information Search and Retrieval Ranking, User, Community Interest, blog, comments Ranking is a key step in Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Existing ranking algorithms use di fferent approaches to increase performance based on similarity com putation, social link analysis, user behavior data, or personalization. Ranking is a dynamic problem; user judgments with respect to a query may change dramatically over time. We hypothesize that the ranking score for each retrieved document in the search result should depend on current community interests. In this paper, we use  X  community interest  X  to determine the ranking score; we compute the interest level of the global community in a specific document for a given query at a given time. Instead of employing us er judgments about what is interesting and what is not, we use user oriented text data (such as blog postings, news comments or us er selected news text) to represent users X  interests. By using a topic-modeling algorithm, topics of the real-time community interest in the user text data are identified as probability distributi ons over features. Each topic is then weighted by historical text data from the community. At last, the community interest vector (CIV) is constructed as a vector of infer a score (using the precomputed probability topic models) that is proportional to the level of community interest in this specific document given the query. This score, the CIV score, is then used for ranking the entire set of search results. In the Web 2.0 context, a user may generate different kinds of text data, such as blogs, selected news, and comments that reflect their interests. In this research, we employ two kinds of media to extract community interest for ranking: 1. User blogs. Blogs are written by user, and the content can 2. Comment centric news data. News is high quality text data, For each popular query (from query log), a list of real-time blogs or comment tagged news is collected. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) is used to extract the topics within the collection. Each topic is then wei ghted by historical data to show the popularity of each topic in the current community. A list of weighted topics constructs the final CIV for each query. A new search result is projected into the same topic vector space by the LDA word-topic distribution. A ranking score is computed by the cosine similarity between the CIV and the topic vector of the search result. As a real-time ranking algorithm, we cannot employ existing test collections for evaluation. Huma n judgment is used for ranking evaluation in this test. The CI V generated from blog data (CIV-blog) and from comment tagged news (CIV-com) are compared to popular ranking algorithms and existing web search results. The top ranked documents will be rated as  X  X nteresting X ,  X  X ust ok X , or  X  X ot relevant X . MAP and NDCG are used to compare results. In preliminary evaluation, experiment with Yah oo Buzz collection, the CIV-blog algorithm can increase the number of  X  X nteresting X  ratings by 16.74% while decreasing the  X  X ot relevant X  rating by 20.59% compared with popular news search engine ranking result (over 9 queries, top 5 search results by 5 users for 5 days). NDCG shows that CIV-blog can significantly (t-test p&lt;0.05) increase the ranking performance. [1] Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y., &amp; Jordan, M. I. (2003). Latent
