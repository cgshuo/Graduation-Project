 We argue that the disruption associated with war can help develop a deeper theoretical and practical understanding of how Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) enable people to repair practices in the work, social, and education spaces. We focus on how people leverage various ICTs in order to reconstitute thei r social world, which will allow us to develop new technologies to aid those who experience similar situations.
 Organizational Impacts: Computer -supported collaborative work . Keywords : Collaboration, Disrupted environments, Resilience Globally, we have been exposed to several events that have caused severe environmental disruptions. Here, in the United States, we have most recently experienced Hurricane Katrina and 9/11. In other parts of the world, people have been severely impacted by natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and wars, e.g. the most recent Chinese earthquake in 2008, the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008, and the Israel -Lebanon war of 2006.
 When people exper ience disruption, the social world on which they typically rely on may change drastically [3] . Disaster studies have looked at how affected populations deal with being socially disrupted, and how people modify t heir behaviors in order to continue acting in this new context [3] . For example, during disaster, people often halt normal activities and engage in behaviors to ameliorate the effects of the disruption, e.g. inf ormation dissemination and rescue activities.
 More recently, with the global proliferation of technology, the role ICTs (i.e. the Internet and mobile phones) play during disaster, e.g. hurricanes and earthquakes, has emerged as an active research topic in the CSCW and CHI communities [7] . The new behaviors people develop may now be enabled by various technological resources, and as such t here exists a small, but developing literature set looking at how technology is used by civilian populations who experience disaster [7] . However, t hese studies have mostly focused on the use of technology during or after a disaster; the majority of which focus on what takes place in th e short period following a specific event.
 Most disasters are events that are small in scale, narrowly localized, and not catastrophic in extent [3] . In other words, natural disasters  X  the major foci of disaster research  X  are generally single events in time and space that disrupt a society [3] . Unlike disasters, people who experience war live with constant risk and uncertainty in their environment, as it is difficult to know when the next bomb will fall, or when the next militia will strike. Citizens living in a war zone must learn to adapt to random events taking place in their environment at any time, in any place  X  they must develop continual situational awareness in order to act. Whereas some attention is now being paid to how technology is being used during or following disaster ev ents [7] , not much work has looked at how ICTs are used by people during war to reconstitute their social world or, in other words, repair various day -to-day practices that may have been disrupted. This research will build upon my previous work where, in conjunction with my advisor, Dr. Gloria Mark, and our research colleague, Dr. Ban Al -Ani, we have studied the ways in which technology makes people resilient in maintaining collaborations when experiencing war [5][6] . We define resilience as people X  X  ability to cope or  X  X ounce back X  [4] . In order to better unders tand this phenomenon, we have conducted interviews with people living in two war zones: (1) Israeli citizens who experienced the Israel -Lebanon war of 2006, and (2) Iraqis who are experiencing the current Gulf War beginning in March 2003.
 Our current focus is now on Iraq because we found that our field site in Israel had  X  X imed out X ; too much time had elapsed between when the war ended and when we conducted interviews  X  people no longer wanted to talk about their experiences at great length. We were not abl e to travel to either war zone to engage in traditional observation and interviews face -to-face, but we conducted semi -structured phone interviews with civilians living in both countries (40 in Israel, and 45 in Iraq). Computer -mediated communication enabl ed us to remain engaged in their practices and ensure not only our own safety as researchers, but the safety of our informants as well. Not only do people in these wars zones lack trust in others, but we also did not want to put them in further jeopardy by having them interact with  X  X oreigners. X  Being identified as someone who is interacting with foreigners can pose a serious threat to informants in their home countries. Additionally, we collected and analyzed archival materials, e.g. blogs, e -mail, online forum discussion threads, photo journals, and video diaries.
 Through our empirical research, we have begun to better understand how technological resources mediate people X  X  actions during disruption. We have found that in both Israel and Iraq, our informan ts were resilient in collaboration  X  that is, through the adoption and re -appropriation of technology, citizens developed assemblages of technological and physical resources where they relied on various technologies, e.g. mobile phones and online social tools, or combined technological and physical resources, in order to act. For example, in both countries, people used mobile phones in order to help negotiate travel routes, which we have referred to as  X  X obile travel networks X .
 More recently we have reporte d how people in Iraq adopted technology to be resilient in forming and maintaining relationships, continuing education, seeking trustworthy information, conducting economic transactions, and creating alternative electric and Internet infrastructures [5] . Further, we found that through the adoption of technology, old cultural practices were merged with the use of technology, and people were also expanding traditional cultural practices as a result of technology ad option [5] . For example, people were finding suitable marriage partners in an online environment due to being physically disrupted, which is uncharacteristic of Iraqi society [5] . My dissertation will continue this line of work, and more deeply explore the use of technology by people living through war. More specifically, I would like to better understand the role technology plays in allowing people to repair various p ractices, as well as maintain and repair societal trust in an environment where distance may play an important role. We often engage in various practices for (1) social life, (2) work, (3) education, (4) travel, and (5) obtaining i nformation and services. These practices, together, compose our social world . During war, people may have to modify these practices for an extended period of time, and these new behaviors may be enabled by the adoption and/or re -appropriation of various te chnologies. It is important that we better understand the ways in which ICTs facilitate people X  X  ability to maintain and repair their practices during times of major upheaval in order to develop new technologies for those living through similar situations. This leads to my main research question: 1. How can people leverage various ICTs to reconstitute the social world when experiencing war? Additionally, when citizens experience war, two major problems may further limit their ability to maintain their socia l world, namely: (1) less trust and (2) more distance.
 Where during disaster trust is not typically a factor, war can lead to a decline in societal trust [2]. Trust can mediate interactions between people, and between people and institutions [1] . Trust as a mediator between people is referred to as  X  X nterpersonal trust X  [1]. Trust as a mediator between people and institutions is referred to as  X  X mpersonal trust X , or system trust [1]. In war zones, violent conflic t can undermine both interpersonal and impersonal trust [2]. Thus, during war, people may no longer trust those around them, and they may no longer rely on governmental institutions.
 Additionally, friends, family members, and co -workers often flee the sit e of physical harm to seek refuge in safer areas, either within the country or outside of the country. It may also be difficult for people to travel to work and to school. Thus, where people may typically work in a collocated work environment, or maintain relationships with friends and family face -to-face, this may not be an option for people who are experiencing war. In this case, people may be separated and unable to work and socialize as done previously. Also, social relationships may deteriorate over ti me. This leads to my second set of questions: 2. Are people using various synchronous and asynchronous communications technologies to connect with people they trust (both old and new relationships) in order to reconstitute the social world? Which practices require trusted interaction? Which do not? 3. Are Iraqis using communications technologies to maintain their old relationships? To what extent are these relationships maintained in the war zone? Are Iraqis using communications technologies to develop new relationships? If so, how are these new connections deemed to be trustworthy? Firstly, I will conduct semi -structured interviews with a target of 50 to 100 Iraqis living in Iraq, the United States, Jordan, and Syria. Interviews with people living in Iraq will be conducted over the phone, or by using Internet telephony applications, e.g. Skype and Yahoo Messenger. The rest of the interviews I conduct will take place in person. I will record interviews using a digital voice recorder, and will transcribe all interviews for analysis.
 Secondly, I plan to conduct a survey to collect data about people X  X  changing social networks, and how they utilized both their old and new relationships to mitigate the effects of war. A survey will allow me to reac h a larger demographic. I will also collect various archival documents, e.g. blog posts, e -mail list data, and Facebook data. This will allow me to further triangulate with the data gathered throug h interviews.
 My analysis will draw from the grounded theory approach to qualitative inquiry. By foregrounding the data itself, grounded theory will facilitate the generation of thematic codes  X  X rounded X  in a deep understanding of the social phenomena at hand. In the course of this coding such patterns can give rise to hypotheses that, in turn, can be iteratively validated or falsified. In my work, I hope to better understand the ways in which technological resources have enabled people to continue acting through war. By attending the GROUP Doctoral Colloquium, I wish to discuss my research with my peers in order to further develop my research agenda, and better define the various ways in which this line of research can further develop the field of CSCW. Additionally, reviewers have been reluctant to accept the validity of our research methodology because we have used snowball sampling to recruit interviewees. This research raises methodological concerns that I would like to discuss with others, and further push this line of work. [1] Abdul -Rahman, A. and Hailes, S. (2000).
