 Commerc ial bu ildings are significant consumers of electric-ity. The first step towards better energy manag ement in commercial bu ildings is monitoring consumption. However, instrumenting every electrical panel in a large commerc ial bu ilding is expensive and wasteful. In this paper, we pro-pose a g reedy meter (sensor) placement algo rithm based on maximization of information ga ined, sub ject t o a cost constraint. The algo rithm provides a near-optimal solution guarantee. Furthermore, to identify power saving o pp ortu-nities, we use an un supervised anomaly detection techn ique based on a low-dimensional embedding. Further, to better manag e resources such as lighting a nd HVA C, we propose a semi-sup ervised app roach combining hidden Markov models (HMM) and a stand ard classifier to model occ up ancy based on readily available port-level network statistics.

In the United States alone, there are an estimated five milli on commercial bu ildings. In 2010 , these bu ildings con-sumed about 1.3 trillion kWh of electricity, roughly one third of the electricity generated in the coun try. The energy costs for commercial bu ildings exceeds $100 bill ion annu ally. Due to recent economic turmoil, and increased awareness of en-vironmental concerns (e.g., global climate change), many companies want to redu ce power use in their bu ildings. Of-ten, they turn to consulting firms for services like bu ilding energy efficiency analyses. The work described in this paper add resses shortcomings of existing a nalyses of this sort.
A first challenge for improving power use in a bu ilding is und erstand ing how much p ower each app liance or device in the bu ilding uses. One option is to install power meters on all electrical panels, to collect usage data near the con-sumers, and get a (app roximate) per-appliance breakdown of power use. The main d isadvantag e of this app roach is the cost to bu y and install the meters. For companies that own a lot of bu ildings (e.g., Walmart has more than 10 ,000 stores globally), this cost becomes prohibitively expensive. Thus, one research question we address is where to place a limited set of meters in a bu ilding, while minimizing the inform ation loss. We propose an efficient greedy algorithm that provides a near-optimal solution.

A second challenge we investiga te is how to systematically monitor bu ilding energy use and automatically detect prob-lems that arise over time. A limitation of manu al consulting services is that they can only identify issues that are occur-ring a t t he time the analysis is condu cted, and typically only a limited nu mber of panels are monitored, identified b y an expert based on the likelihoo d of energy savings. Having a consultant repeat the study on a regular (e.g., daily) basis is not cost effective, so an automated techn ique is highly desired. We present results from app lying o ur un supervised anomaly (fault) detection and ranking methods for monitor-ing tens of meters over a six month p eriod.

Lastly, consulting stud ies will typically recommend static solutions to redu ce bu ilding energy use. For example, turn on all l ights only du ring work hours (e.g., 8a m to 6 pm), and turn most off otherwise. While such techn iques do help reduce power use in a bu ilding, further savings are possible. One app roach is to only turn on lights (or HVA C systems) in areas where people are currently in, and to turn them off when the people leave. To facilitate such d ynamic resource manag ement, we developed a semi-supervised method for occ up ancy modeling.

Our group is instrumenting three large commercial bu ild-ings on the HP Labs campus in Palo Alto, CA. This instru-mentation will provide extensive data o n the campus power use, which will establish the  X  X  round truth X  aga inst which we will evaluate our power manag ement methods.

The paper makes the following contribu tions:
The remaind er of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-tion 2 provides an overview of the HP Labs campu s, the power delivery and measureme nt infrastructure, and the cam-pu s power use characteristics. Section 3 describes our KDD methods. Section 4 evaluates our methods. Section 5 dis-cusses related work. Section 6 summarizes our work and future directions.
The HP Labs campu s contains six main bu ildings with a total footprint of 700 ,000 sq. ft. We are instrumenting three two-storey bu ildings (1, 2, 3), as highlighted in Figure 1. These three bu ildings have a 300 ,000 sq. ft. footprint and host about 500 occup ants.
Buildings 1, 2 a nd 3 a re powered by a single utility feed (3-phase 12 .5kV). An emerg ency generator (3-ph ase 480 V) maintains critical l oa ds in the event of a utili ty failure. Au-tomatic transfer switches (ATS) are used to revert from the utility to backup p ower. Each bu ilding has a main distribu -tion p anel (3-ph ase 480 V) t hat branches to about 10 major sub-loads or sub-panels. A 135 kW ph oto voltaic array on top of Building 3 o ffsets power demand du ring daylight hours.
To date, 33 power meters have been deployed on our cam-pu s. These include meters for bu ilding a nd top-level load Figure 2: Cam pus power use and outsid e temp era ture. distribution panels in Buildings 1-3. We are now instrument-ing the second -tier distribu tion p anels within each bu ilding, to o btain fin er grained electrical data for our future work.
The installed electrical meters are commercial (3-phase) devices from Schn eider Electric ( www.schneider-electric. com ). Data is retrieved from each meter every 10 second s using the MODB US over Ethernet protocol. The data in-cludes metrics such as line voltag e, real and apparent power, power factor, current and frequ ency. The data is stored in a PI-Server from OSIsoft ( www.osisoft.com ).
As further motivation for the challenges add ressed in this paper, we briefly examine some characteristics of the cam-power use for Buildings 1-3 o ver a o ne week period (from Jan. 22 through Jan. 28 , 2012 ). The peak loa d is nearly 2 MW; und erstand ing how to reduce this would translate di-rectly to o perational savings for the company. The base loa d is roughly 1.5 MW. An implication of this is very little in-sight on what is responsible for campu s power consumption can b e gleaned (e.g., via disagg regation techn iques like [9] since none of the algorithms scale up to hand le hund reds to thousand s of loads present in commerc ial bu ildings, and further, none of the methods disaggregate base loa d) from the agg regate power. This means that more meters must be installed. Our meter placement algorithm addresses the issue of how many meters are needed and where they are needed, to minimize the cost while maximizing the informa-tion obtained.

The midd le three graph s in Figure 2 show the total power demand for Buildings 1, 2 a nd 3, respectively. The bot-tom graph shows the outside temperature. Comparing this graph to the others reveals a correla tion b etween outside temperature, occup ancy (i.e., work hours) and p ower use. This motivates our investigation in Section 3.3 o f occ up ancy modeling, to reduce the use of heating o r cooling in areas of the bu ilding that people are not actively using. Figure 3 shows the overall framework of our app roach. The meter placement algorithm forms the basis for instru-menting a bu ilding power infrastructure. For bu ilding power manag ement, we propose an un sup ervised anomaly detec-tion and ranking method b ased on low dimensional embed-commercial bu ildings as well. tion information at panels in A , where H ( X L | X A ) =  X  X
Unfortunately, the optimization p roblem in (1) is NP-hard. Hence, we propose a g reedy app roach to o ptimize the given problem. The greedy algo rithm choo ses panels for meter deployment in a sequential mann er, where given the set of panels that have already been chosen b y the algorithm (denoted by A ) , the next best panel is chosen to be the one that maximizes the ga in in mutual information, i .e.,
The solution obtained using the above greedy algorithm is not necessarily an optimal solution for the optimization problem in (1). However, we show below that the obtained greedy solution is guaranteed to be near-optimal.
To show that t he solution obtained using the above greedy app roach is near-optimal, we rely on the theory of sub -modu larity introdu ced by Nemhauser et al. [21] and p op-ularized by the work of Krause et al. [14, 13 ].

Krause et al. [14] stud y bud geted maximization p roblems of the form where S = { 1 ,  X   X   X  , N } is a set of elements and F : A  X  R is a function that maps the set of elements to the real line. A greedy solution to this problem is to select elements sequentially according to Krause et al. [14] show that t he solution obtained using this greedy app roach is near-optimal i n the following sense iff the objective function F is submod ular, where sub modu -larity is defined below.

De finiti on 1. (Subm odularity) Let F be a function that maps from a set of elements S to the real line R . Then, F is s aid to be submodular iff  X A  X  B  X  S and for any j /  X  B ,
In our optimization p roblem, the objective function is mu-tual i nformation, which un fortunately is not sub modu lar, except for some known special cases [13, 16 , 17 ]. However, as we will show below, i n our problem setting, mutual in-formation turns out t o be submodu lar, thu s guaranteeing near-optimality of the above greedy algo rithm.

Le mm a 1. Given the tree topo logy describe d in Section 3.1, let S denote the set of nodes in the tree and L the set of leaf nodes. Then,  X A  X  B  X  S , and for any j /  X  B , I ( X L ; X A X  j )  X  I ( X L ; X A )  X  I ( X L ; X B X  j )  X  I ( X
Proof. From the defin ition of mutual information, we have I ( X L ; X A X  j )  X  I ( X L ; X A ) = H ( X L | X A )  X  H ( X where the second equality follows from the first by expand -ing the e ntropy terms and b y simple manipu lation of the resulting terms . Note that the second term in (3) is equal to 0, i.e., H ( X j | X L , X A ) = 0, as given the power consumption at all the leaf nodes, the power consumption at any panel up stream is completely deterministic.
 Hence, the relation in (2) reduces to showing which follows from the principle of X  X nformation n ever hu rts X  in information theory [5]. Thus, proving the submodu larity of mutual information und er the given tree topology. Another strategy to select meters would be by app lying Granger causality, which considers the direction of flow of in-formation un like mutual i nformation. Note that t his could be reme died by the use of Transfer entropy, which is a ver-sion of mutual i nform ation that can d etect t he direction of inform ation fl ow [24 ], however, transfer entropy is currently restricted to bivariate situations.

Granger Causality (or G-causality) t est, which was ini-tially introdu ced in the field of economics [8], i s a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series is useful i n forecasting a nother. It is normally tested in the context of linear regression models. For example, let X ( t ) and Y ( t ) be two time series. Consider the following two auto-regressive models for predicting X ( t ) where p is the maximum nu mber of lagg ed observations in-(residu als) for the two regression models. If the variance in the prediction error is reduced by the inclusion of Y ( t ) in the model, then Y is said to G-cause X . In other words, Y is s aid to G-cause X if the coefficients in { b j } p j =1 significantly different from zero.

This test could p otentially be used to reveal any hidden causal relationships between the loa ds (leaf nodes in the tree topology). Incorporating these relationships could further lead to a better choice of panels for meter deployment.
Anomaly (or fault) detection is useful in detecting a b-normal behavior in the power usage data collected from a
Commerc ial b uildings consume significant amoun ts of en-ergy. Concerns over energy prices and global climate change are motivating bu ilding o perators to redu ce energy consump-tion. In this paper, we propose and evaluate three methods to a id in this effort. Our meter placement algorithm is both efficient and effective, guaranteeing a near optimal solution to information maximization b y exploiting submodu larity. In comparisons with other methods, the abili ty of the meter set selected using o ur algorithm to predict t he measurements of the un selected meter set were found to be superior (by an average of about 15%). Our anomaly detection method is shown to identify nu mero us types of un expected consump-tion p atterns. Lastly, our occ up ancy modeling a pp roach can be used to dynamically control li ghting o r HVA C resources, thereby reducing their energy consumption.

We plan to extend our work in several ways. We intend to leverage occup ancy modeling results for enh ancing a nomaly detection. Further, we plan to a utomate the anomaly char-acterization task, and extend our algo rithm to incorporate feedback from a bu ilding a dministrator. In add ition, we are increasing instrumentation on our campus, to a id in validat-ing o ur methods. Finally, further methods may be developed as we evolve our test bed into a demonstrator.
