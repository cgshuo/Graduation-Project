 Urbanization X  X  rapid progress has modernized many people X  X  lives but also engendered big issues, such as traffic congestion, increased energy consumption, and environmen-tal pollution. Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Ur-ban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people X  X  lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer science meets conventional city-related fields, such as transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology, in the context of urban spaces.

The objective of this special issue on urban computing is to bring together top-quality articles on the art and practice of urban computing to demonstrate and discuss its scope, methodologies, applications, and potential research topics. We received 34 submissions, from which nine articles have been selected for publication after an extensive peer review process.

The first article, entitled  X  X rban Computing: Concepts, Methodologies, and Applica-tions X  by Zheng et al., introduces the concept, general framework, and key challenges of urban computing from the perspective of computer science. The article surveys the representative research in seven categories of applications. The typical technologies that are needed in urban computing are also proposed, with a few potential research topics suggested at the end.
 The second article, entitled  X  X odel-Based Count Series Clustering for Bike Sharing System Usage Mining, a Case Study with the Velib X  system of Paris X  by Come et al., presents a statistical model to automatically partition the stations in terms of their temporal dynamics over the day with respect to the number of rented and returned bikes. The results produced by such an approach give insights into the relationships between stations X  neighborhood type and the generated mobility patterns, inducing specific usage patterns in the Bike Sharing System data.
 The third article, entitled  X  X ining User Check-in Behavior with a Random Walk for Urban Point-of-Interest Recommendations X  by Ying et al., proposes a location recom-mendation approach concerning a user X  X  preferences and the properties of a location, using the check-in data from location-based social networks.

The fourth article, entitled  X  X sing Digital Footprints for a City-Scale Traffic Simu-lation X  by McArdle et al., presents a micro-simulation of urban traffic flows within a large-scale scenario implemented for the Greater Dublin region in Ireland, using the digital footprints of city inhabitants on services like Twitter and Foursquare rather than conventional methods such as a population census and dedicated road surveys. The fifth article, entitled  X  X harging and Storage Infrastructure Design for Electric Vehicles X  by Momtazpour et al., presents a framework to support placement of charg-ing stations for an electrical vehicle deployment scenario by modeling and analyzing networks of interactions between electric systems and urban populations.
 The sixth article, entitled  X  X bject-Oriented Travel Package Recommendation X  by Tan et al., offers tourists proper travel packages composed of a set of selected land-scapes concerning additional contextual information, such as price, time, and route constraints. The proposed method was evaluated based on real travel package data sources.

The seventh article, entitled  X  X raffic Information Publication with Privacy Preserva-tion X  by Gurung et al., proposes a privacy-preserving algorithm for publishing spatial trajectories, which are widely generated when people use location-based services, such as online navigation systems.

The eighth article, entitled  X  X easuring and Recommending Time-Sensitive Routes from Location-Based Data X  by Hsieh et al., recommends time-sensitive routes, con-sisting of a sequence of locations with associated timestamps, based on knowledge extracted from large-scale timestamped location sequence data (e.g., check-ins from Gowalla) and the user-specified source and the destination.
 The ninth article, entitled  X  X heck-ins in Blau space: Applying Blau X  X  Macro-Sociological Theory to Foursquare Check-ins from New York City X  by Joseph et al., uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation to cluster Foursquare users in New York City into dif-ferent types (e.g., tourists and athletics) using geo-spatial location, time, users X  friends on social networking sites, venue function, and so forth.

We would like to acknowledge the authors of the submitted articles and the reviewers who actively collaborated in reaching the careful selection of articles in this special issue.

In addition, we would like to thank the Editor-in-Chief, Dr. Qiang Yang, for his help and strong support on this special issue!
