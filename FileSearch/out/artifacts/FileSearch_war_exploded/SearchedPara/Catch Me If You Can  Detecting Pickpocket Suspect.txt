 Massive data collected by automated fare collection (AFC) systems provide opportunities for studying both personal traveling behaviors and collective mobility patterns in the urban area. Existing studies on the AFC data have primar-ily focused on identifying passengers X  movement patterns. In this paper, however, we creatively leveraged such data for identifying thieves in the public transit systems. In-deed, stopping pickpockets in the public transit systems has been critical for improving passenger satisfaction and public safety. However, it is challenging to tell thieves from regular passengers in practice. To this end, we developed a suspect detection and surveillance system, which can identify pick-pocket suspects based on their daily transit records. Specif-ically, we first extracted a number of features from each passenger X  X  daily activities in the transit systems. Then, we took a two-step approach that exploits the strengths of unsupervised outlier detection and supervised classification models to identify thieves, who exhibit abnormal traveling behaviors. Experimental results demonstrated the effective-ness of our method. We also developed a prototype system with a user-friendly interface for the security personnel.

Passengers in the public transit systems have been the main target for pickpockets. In many cities, thefts happen frequently in public transit systems, because passengers tend to pay less attention to their belongings when they are in a rush or in a crowded environment. For example, during the first nine months of 2014, 350 pickpockets were caught in the subway system and 490 were caught on buses 1 in Beijing, China. Many other big cities in the world, such as Barcelona, Prague, Rome, and Paris, are also reported to suffer from the pickpocket problem 2 , which has led to public safety concerns [23, 7]. Indeed, it is challenging to detect theft activities committed by cunning thieves who know how to escape without being disclosed. Despite the substantial cost in manpower and resources, many thieves are still at large. It is critical to provide a smart surveillance and tracking tool for the security personnel of the transit systems.

With rapid advances in information technology and data processing capacities, transactional records collected by au-tomated fare collection (AFC) systems [20] have become valuable for understanding passengers X  mobility patterns and the urban dynamics [6, 3, 20, 29, 18]. However, most of the existing studies focused on identifying regular, collective mo-bility patterns, such as commute flows and transit networks. Our study is the first to focus on identifying thieves based on AFC data. In fact, it is possible to detect thieves using AFC records because behavioral differences are coined in the mobility footprints, which can help to separate suspects from regular passengers. Examples of such behaviors, which can make suspects notable, include traveling for an extended length of time, making unnecessary transfers, and/or wan-dering on certain routes while making random stops.
However, detecting thieves based on AFC records is not a simple outlier detection problem. Figure 1 shows the dif-ference between a known thief and an outlier. We can see a number of trajectories between hot regions A and B . By careful examination, we can see that most passengers move from one region to another using near-optimal configuration ( e.g. , shortest time/distance, or a minimal number of trans-fers). However, a passenger (a known suspect) who took the path A  X  C  X  D  X  B looks suspicious because there is no need to make transfers at C and D in order to reach B . Based on the above observation, passengers who exhibit such abnormal behaviors will be selected for further exam-ination. In contrast, another passenger who travels from E to B is an outlier, since few passengers take the same path. However, this passenger is likely just a regular passenger who originates from a less crowded area.

In summary, to identify thieves from AFC records, we are faced with a number of inherent challenges.  X  The first challenge is how to identify useful features to dis-tinguish thieves from regular passengers. These features should not only help us understand the behaviors of pick-pockets, but also help us build a suspect detection and tracking system for supporting the security personnel.  X  Second, using regular outlier detection methods tends to result in a large number of false positives. In particular, not every trip made by a regular passenger looks normal.
Regular commuters may occasionally make trips to visit friends or places of interest, and some of such trips may look suspicious by how much they deviate from regular behaviors.  X  Third, a large number of AFC records are being collected from millions of passengers, only a tiny fraction of which are pickpockets. Identifying such a small group of people in such a large-scale dataset is like looking for a needle in the haystack.  X  Finally, we also need to effectively transform our knowl-edge based on model development into a decision support system, so that real-time, personalized deployment rec-ommendations could be made to help to guide security personnel to perform their work more efficiently.

To this end, in this paper, a comprehensive approach is taken to meet the above challenges. Specifically, we first construct a feature representation for profiling passengers. Furthermore, we establish a two-step framework to separate normal movement patterns from irregular behaviors, and eventually, distinguish thieves from regular passengers. Fi-nally, we leverage real-world datasets from multiple sources for model training and validation, and implement a proto-type system for end users.
 Figure 2 shows the overall architecture of our framework. We first partition the city area into regions with functional categories. Then, the mobility characteristics of passen-gers are extracted from transit records and incident reports. Moreover, we build an individual mobility database to store the profile of each passenger. Next, we implement our frame-work by regular passenger filtering and suspect detection. The system is efficient and interactive, with both mobile and desktop clients. Finally, the user feedback information, such as newly confirmed thieves, will be entered as ground truth for future model training.

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-tion 2 provides an overview the AFC datasets, based on which we performed the study. A detailed description of features that we extract to characterize mobility profiles of passengers is presented in Section 3. A two-step framework of the suspect identification system is proposed in Section 4. Experimental results are summarized in Section 5, and an overview of the deployed system is presented in Section 6. Finally, we summarize related work in Section 7, and draw conclusions in Section 8.
The data for our study have been collected from multi-ple sources. These include transit records, geographical in-formation, and theft incident reports. In this section, we provide an overview of the data.
Our study is based on a large-scale transit records dataset collected from a public transit system that includes buses and subways. Passengers utilizing the transit service are charged by the distance they travel. A rechargeable smart card is issued to each passenger, who has to swipe the card when they board or exit a vehicle. The AFC system then calculates the fare according to the stations of boarding and exiting. As a result, each raw AFC record consists of the smart card ID, the route number, the event ( i.e. , boarding or exiting), the station, and the time stamp. We transformed the data so that each transit record consists of one board-ing and one exiting event of the same ID. There are about 1.7 billion records between April and June in 2014. After removing replicates and extremely infrequent riders, we are left with over 1.6 billion records that involve approximately 6 million passengers (for three months).
In order to describe the data and subsequent feature ex-traction process clearly, here we clarify two concepts, tran-sit records and trips , using a concrete example. Figure 3 illustrates an example passenger X  X  activities in a typical day. Part (a) is the actual trajectory on the city X  X  map; Part (b) splits the trajectory into three separate trips; and Part (c) demonstrates the corresponding transit records in our data. In particular, let us say that the passenger holds a smart card with an ID of 4322. He started by taking Route 52 at Station a , which is next to his home, at 7:15 a.m. Hav-ing to make a transfer, he exited Route 52 at Station b at 7:40 a.m., and walked across the street to take Route 26 at Station c (7:46 a.m.). Then he got off at Station d , which is next to his workplace, at 8:23 a.m. He completed Trip 1 since the next time he was in the transit system was more than 30 minutes ( i.e. , our empirical cutoff) later. Similarly, the transit in the afternoon from d to e was considered Trip 2; and the transit from e back home at a , making a transfer at f , was considered Trip 3. As a result, we collected the five transit records that describe three trips. Figure 3: An example of trips and transit records.
Intuitively, a transit record corresponds to one segment of transit between a pair of consecutive boarding and exiting events of the same passenger. Even though this segment of transit may pass a number of stations, the passenger has never left the vehicle during the time. In contrast, a trip consists of one or more such segments, which connect places of interest on the two ends, where the passenger stays for extended periods of time. A trip may include connections or transfers, as long as those breaks are relatively short in time. Formally, we provide the following definitions.
Definition 1 (Transit record). A transit record tr contains the following information:
As a result, for each transit record, we were able to com-pute the travel distance tr dist , travel time tr time and number of stops tr stops during the transit.

Definition 2 (Trip). A trip Tr is a sequence of tran-sit records Tr = ( tr 1 ,tr 2 ,  X  X  X  ,tr n ) , where the passenger X  X  origin location is Tr origin = tr 1 vboard and the destination is Tr
In practice, we construct one trip record if and only if the time gap between two consecutive transit records is no more than 30 minutes. The trip X  X  time duration is calculated as Tr
To project the transit records to the city map, we made use of two datasets of important geographical information. Namely, the points of interests (POI) data and the public transit network information.

With the POI data, we followed Yuan X  X  work [28] to seg-ment the urban area into small regions by major road net-works, and then categorize each region into one of ten func-tions, as listed in Table 1. These regions are then color coded and visualized in Figure 4(a).
The public transit network dataset provides basic infor-mation of each route of buses and subways. Each route is a sequence of stations, and the raw data include the route number, the sequence ID in the route, the name of the sta-tion, and the geo-location expressed as latitude and longi-tude. As shown in Figure 4(b), in total, we have 44,524 bus stations (points in gray) covered by 896 bus routes, and 320 subway stations (points in blue) covered by 18 subway routes. To remove the redundancy and better model the human mobility pattern, we merge stations located at the same road intersection.
Confirmed pickpocket incidents are publicly announced via Sina Weibo, the primary social network services in China. It is considered public data since posts are all visible to ev-eryone, just like Twitter in the United States. We included two types of pickpocket reports: official announcements, as announced by the police 3 , and personal complaints, as posted by the victims. Figure 5 provides an example of each type of report. We can see that the date, time, and loca-tion of the theft events are normally identified in the posts, which has helped us to link such events to other sources of data. We found 10,529 records during our study period. (a) Police report:  X  X t 7:40 a.m. on July 10th, a thief was caught (b) Victim complaint:  X  X ust now (around 5:20pm), my sister X  X 
In this section, we will describe the features we extracted from passengers X  AFC records, which are potentially useful for characterizing public transit mobility patters, and thus, will eventually be used for distinguishing pickpocket sus-pects from regular passengers. As shown in Table 2, our features are grouped into three categories: daily behaviors, social comparisons, and historical behaviors.
The daily travel time is defined as the total duration spent by each passenger in the public transit system, and the daily riding frequency is defined as the number of transit records traveled by each passenger per day. Figure 6: Distributions of travel time and the num-ber of transit records.

Indeed, picking pockets is a hard work: a thief has to spend quite long time in the crowded buses, subways, or near the transit stations to find potential victims and better crime moments. Also, in order to have more theft opportuni-ties, a thief (pickpocket) tends to travel between bus/subway stations in random ways without specific destinations. Such abnormal behaviors lead to abnormal daily travel time and riding frequency. Figure 6 plots the distribution of daily travel time and riding frequency, respectively, of passengers traveling around the city with smart cards. We can see that more than 80% passengers finish their travels in 2 hours and within 2 transit records per day. In comparison, the iden-tified thieves often spend more than 3 hours of daily travel time, and their daily riding frequency is also larger. A short ride is a transit record tr with less than 3 stops. Regular passengers normally prefer fewer transfers in each trip. Therefore, if a transit has to be made, each transit record will pass several bus/subway stops. In contrast, pick-pockets often switch routes within few stops to avoid attract-ing fellow passengers X  attention and being recognized. Figure 7: Distributions of short distance trips.

Figure 7 are the distribution of the daily number of short rides for all passengers with at least 7 and 19 transit records, respectively. The x-axis is the number of short rides and the y-axis is the percentage of passengers. For the passengers with at least 7 transit records in Figure 7(a), the distribution approximates Gaussian with mean around 3. In Figure 7(b), for the passengers with at least 19 transit records, the dis-tribution peak is shifted to the right. It shows that the frequency of short rides increases with increasing number of transit records.
A high-level view of the human mobility patterns can be summarized by transition among regions, where each re-gion covers multiple stations. For example, the morning commuting trips can be abstracted as  X  X eaving from resi-dence region, then transiting at transfer stations, and ar-riving at the workplace region at last X . Other examples in-clude  X  X hopping trips X  like residence  X  shopping facil-ities  X  residence , or  X  X ightseeing trips X  like residence  X  scenic spot  X  scenic spot  X  residence .

Indeed, such sequential information is very useful for pat-tern discovery and predictive modeling [14, 12, 30]. To dis-criminate regular passengers and pickpockets, we observed that there are typical sequential patterns followed by the regular passengers. However, pickpockets tend not to fol-low the typical patterns, and wander randomly among the functional regions.

As a result, we define features such as the number of boarding stations and the number of boarding regions. Then, we count the transition frequency between any pair of func-tion categories for the daily trip of each passenger.
In practice, the majority of human mobility patterns are regular movements between a small set of locations that the passenger is familiar with. Pickpockets often spend a signif-icant portion of the time within few routes or regions if they intend for opportunities. In particular, once a thief has com-mitted the crime or lost the target, he or she would likely come back to a familiar station for the next target. Thieves know profoundly well about and wander around these ar-eas. Therefore, we can measure such wandering behaviors by counting the maximum number of times a route was taken, or the maximum number of visits made to a region.

Moreover, the wandering behaviors lead to concentration of the passenger X  X  boarding or exiting locations. We use the number of clusters as another feature, which measures the wandering concentration.
This group of features measures the difference between the individual behaviors and the typical behaviors of the population, so we call them social features. According to our empirical study, two very informative social features are the time gap of trips and the time gap of region transi-tions. Actually, given the same origin and destination, the trip variation of the majority of the population (i.e., regular passengers) is low. For example, most of the trips will be finished within a specific amount of time given the trip ori-gin and destination, while pickpocket suspects may spend more time in the transit system during the trip.

Thus, for each pair of origin o and destination d , we find the travel time of all trips between this pair. We then con-vert the time gap significance of a given trip by the quantile of its travel time with respect to the population. Similarly, we also define the time gap significance of region transitions.
We compute the statistics (e.g., median and standard de-viation) of the daily features observed in the last seven days for each passenger, to quantify their historical behaviors. We use the median instead of the mean, because median is more robust in the presence of outliers, especially if the sample size is small. In our case, we only used data from the past seven days, and median can effectively avoid the impact of non-routine passenger behaviors. The standard deviation indicates the degree of variation of the daily behaviors of individual passengers. Regular passengers following routine trajectories normally generate statistics with less variations. Moreover, we also record the number of days (out of the recent seven days) when the passenger was detected as po-tential pickpocket suspects.
This section presents the key component of our thief foot-mark detection system. Specifically, in order to distinguish pickpockets from the regular passengers with high accuracy and low false-positives, we develop a two-step framework. The first step adopts anomaly detection techniques to iden-tify thieves as well as some suspects from the passenger pop-ulation. The second step further distinguishes the pickpock-ets from the suspects, by mapping the defined features into a high dimensional space and computing the optimal decision surface in support vector machines (SVM).

Suppose there are totally N passengers included in the dataset { ( x j ,y j ) | j = 1 ,...,N } , where x j  X  R extracted features associated with the j -th passenger, and y j  X  { 0 , 1 } is the classification label, such that y and only if the passenger is a determined as a pickpocket suspect. Our objective is to develop a predictive model which can be used to identify pickpockets from the regular passenger population.
In this study, we develop a two-step framework for identi-fying pickpocket suspects. On one hand, since the dominant majority of the passengers are regular ones, it is non-trivial to use a classification algorithm. Specifically, the percentage of confirmed pickpockets is extremely low in the passenger population. Simple heuristics like over-sampling and under-sampling would only be helpful for handling moderate class imbalance, but not imbalance as extreme as ours. Building robust machine learning models for such unbalanced data is still an active research area in the literature [21, 4, 16, 17]. On the other hand, utilizing anomaly detection algorithms, which are typically unsupervised, not only cannot scale well, but also may lead to significant false-positives, since many regular passengers who occasionally perform irregular activ-ities can be misclassified as suspects.

To address these challenges, we develop a two-step frame-work by unifying the unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised classification in a novel way. We show that the two steps can effectively utilize the supervised information, overcome the issue of unbalanced data distribution, and re-inforce the learning performances. The overall framework can predict the pickpockets with very low false-positives. In the two-step framework, we approximate the predictive function f (  X  ) as f ( x ) = g ( x ) h ( x ), and equivalently: This relationship can also be demonstrated in Figure 8. Figure 8: A two-step approach for suspect detection.
In other words, we first use function g (  X  ) (the first step) to filter out regular passengers whose mobility patterns are typical in the majority of the passenger population. If the passenger associated with feature vector x is not filtered out (i.e., g ( x ) = 1), we then use function h (  X  ) (the second step) to detect whether the passenger is a pickpocket suspect. In the following of this section, we develop the two steps (func-tion g (  X  ) and h (  X  )) in our framework.
The first step in our framework is the regular passenger filtering by anomaly detection algorithm. Its objective is to exclude regular passengers without any suspicious behaviors from later modeling steps. Therefore, we intentionally allow some false-positives in the anomaly detection result.
Many general purpose anomaly detection algorithms can be used to implement the filtering function g (  X  ). In this pa-per, we use the One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine) [25] method due to its superior detection accuracy, com-puting efficiency, and modeling flexibility. One-Class SVM computes non-linear decision boundaries to detect outliers, using appropriate kernel functions and soft margins. The kernel function  X  (  X  ,  X  ) is defined as The function  X  (  X  ) maps the original feature into a high-dimensional kernel space where the optimal decision bound-ary exists: and then
The optimization objective of the One-Class SVM is to: subject to b g ( x i ) =  X  w, X  ( x i )  X  +  X   X  i and i  X  0 for all collected passengers n = 1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,N . The parameter C con-trols the fraction of anomalies (e.g., x such that g ( x ) = 1) after the filtering.

It can be shown that the optimization process requires  X  (  X  ,  X  ) instead of an implicit formulation of  X  (  X  ). We use the widely used Gaussian kernel: and learn the best parameter h (bandwidth) by cross-validation.
The second step in our framework is the suspect detection to eventually identify the suspect pickpockets. After the reg-ular passengers filtered by the first step, now we have sub-jects including the real suspects as well as the false-positives not filtered out by the One-Class SVM. However, by control-ling the parameter C of One-Class SVM, the number of the false-positives are limited and comparable with the number of suspects. Now the second step further distinguish these two subsets with supervised information verified by the so-cial media.

Specifically, suppose there are in total M subjects after filtering in the dataset { ( x j ,y j ) | j = 1 ,  X  X  X  ,M } , where for the training purpose we have y j = 1 if and only if the passen-ger associated with feature vector x j is a verified pickpocket, otherwise y j = 0. Now, to train the suspect detection model, we again use the support vector machine (SVM), where we use the same feature mapping function  X  (  X  ) and kernel func-tion  X  (  X  ,  X  ) defined in Subsection 4.2. To classify the real suspects and false-positives, the optimal decision hyperplane is: b h ( x ) =  X  w, X  ( x )  X  +  X  and then h ( x ) = compute the optimal w and  X  in h (  X  ), we optimize: Again, C is trade-off parameter and the computing depends only on the kernel function define in Equation 4.
In this section, we present experimental results with our proposed framework. First, we describe the experimental environments and provide implementation details. Then, in comparison with several baseline methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will also evaluate the usefulness of feature extracted in Table 2. Finally, we show practical usage of our methods in a real-world system.
Datasets. We conduct our experiments on real-world datasets containing over 1.6 billion transit records, as dis-cussed in Section 2. We split the data into historical training set and evaluation test set. Specifically, training set covers three months (from April to June, 2014) and test set comes from the following two weeks (in July 2014). Also, from the training set, we filter out passengers whose maximum number of daily records is no more than three.

Platform. All experiments were conducted on a Win-dows Server 2012 64-bit system (4-CPU, each with 2.6GHz with Quad-Core, and 128G main memory). All algorithms and our real-world system were implemented with Java.
Baselines. The method is compared with a variety of competing methods grouped into the following categories: Classification methods (CM). The classification meth-Anomaly detection (AD). Anomaly detection methods, Two-step (TS) methods. As aforementioned, our approach For all the methods with parameters, we optimize the pa-rameters with 10-fold cross-validation by further dividing the training set into 80% for model fitting and 20% for pa-rameter validation.

Evaluation metrics. We use precision, recall, and F-score computed with test set to evaluate the performances of different methods. The precision is the number of cor-rectly identified positives divided by the number of identi-fied positives instances. The recall is the number of correctly identified positives divided by the number of all positive in-stances in the test set. Then, the F-score is defined as:
Table 3 summarizes the performances of our method and the baselines listed above.

We have several interesting observations which confirm our research motivation. First, the precisions of all one-step methods are very low, especially for classification methods including DT, LR, and SVM. The AD methods perform somehow better, but still lower than our two-step frame-work. In contrast, all the two-step combinations signifi-cantly improve the precisions, among which, our TS-SVM performs best. This observation shows that the two-step approach can effectively reduce the false-positives. Second, two-step methods also perform better in terms of other met-rics. For example, the recall of our TS-SVM is consistently above 90%, by finding the detection/classification bound-aries in the non-linear kernel space. Finally, given the excel-lent recall of TS-SVM, we contend that it X  X   X  X round-truth X  precision can be higher than the reported 7%. The reason is that not all the suspects have been caught or reported.
To further study the discriminative power of the features, we evaluate the performance of our framework (TS-SVM) with different feature combinations.

As shown in Figure 9, we use Db , Sc , and Hb to represent the daily behavior , social comparison , and historical behavior features, respectively. Most significantly, the precision of the daily behavior features is improved by the social comparison and further the historical behaviors. Such improvements can also be observed for other metrics in the table.

We also empirically compare the modeling performances on weekdays and weekends. As expected, since the human mobilities in weekends are more complicated, the detection accuracy of our method is slightly lower on weekends.
With the automatic feature extraction and two-step sus-pect detection model described above, we developed a deci-sion support system for the security personnel to easily spot Gulou), whereas most regular passengers only visit one func-tional region during a short period of time.
As urban sensing data, such as GPS traces, call details records, and smart card logs, grow ubiquitous, research ef-forts devoted to analyzing such data has resulted in a num-ber of works in recent years. In this section, we provide a brief review of the related work, categorized into two groups.
The first group of literature focuses on finding patterns in passenger activity records. Such knowledge can be useful in a variety of applications, and plays a vital role in effectively finding and satisfying passenger needs. Examples include assessing the performance of the transit network, identify-ing and optimizing problematic or flawed bus routes, im-proving the accuracy of passenger flow forecast between two regions, and making service adjustments that accommodate variations in ridership on different days. In particular, using AFC data, [3] estimates the crowdedness of various stations in the transportation network. [22] measures the variabil-ity of transit behaviors on different days of the week. In addition, different studies have investigated unique charac-teristics of traveling patterns of the elderly [27], students, and adults [22], which provide interesting insights for un-derstanding behavioral differences of sub-populations.
It has been suggested that human mobility patterns follow a high degree of spatial and temporal regularity, and are thus highly predictable [9, 26]. Existing studies in discovering trip patterns typically aim at discovering movement patterns by finding frequently visited places of regular passengers, who travel with the same sequence of places at the similar time of day. For example, [5] identifies spatiotemporal patterns from GPS traces of taxis for night bus route planning. [19] tries to reflect the common routing preference of the past passengers by finding the most frequent path of a certain time period. [6] discovers and explains movement patterns of a set of moving objects (e.g. traffic management, birds migration, disease spreading).
Existing studies on detecting anomalies in urban sensing data can be divided into two categories: those based on locations, and those on trajectories.

Along the line of location-based anomaly detection, [28] presents a framework that learns the context of different functional regions in a city, which provides the basis of our feature extraction approach. Besides, [15] attempts to dis-cover casual relationships among spatiotemporal outliers. [24] mines representative terms from social media that peo-ple posted when location-relevant events happen in the city, such as accidents and protests. [10] discovers black-hole or volcano patterns in human mobility data in a city, which can quickly identify gathering events, such as football matches and concerts. Detection of such anomalies can help sensing abnormal events, and provide input for intelligent decision support, such as smoothing the traffic flow [10].

The main goal of trajectory based anomaly detection is to find a small percentage of individuals, whose movement traces are different from the general population. One ex-ample is to identify fraudulent taxi driving behaviors. A large number of studies have investigated trajectory based anomaly detection using data mining techniques, such as graph based [6], clustering based [20, 3, 1], local/context-aware based [2, 13], dimension reduction based [11] and evi-dence based ( e.g. , using Dempster-Shafer theory [8]). While the trajectory of pickpockets with features that are implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful from large datasets, pickpocket suspect detection based on AFC records is a novel problem that has not been considered in the litera-ture, and is quite challenging.
In this paper, we developed a suspect detection and track-ing system by mining large-scale transit records. The sys-tem can help identify pickpocket suspects X  and enable active surveillance in high-risk areas. Specifically, we first con-structed a feature representation for profiling passengers. Then, we established a novel two-step framework to distin-guish regular passengers from pickpocket suspects. Finally, we leverage real-world datasets from multiple sources for model training and validation, and implement a prototype system for end users. Experimental results on real-world data showed the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
