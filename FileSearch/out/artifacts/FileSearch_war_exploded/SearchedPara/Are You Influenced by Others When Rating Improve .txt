 Conformity has a strong influence to user behaviors, even in online environment. When surfing online, users are usu-ally flooded with others X  opinions. These opinions implic-itly contribute to the user X  X  ongoing behaviors. However, there is no research work modeling online conformity yet. In this paper, we model user X  X  conformity in online rat-ing sites. We conduct analysis using real data to show the existence and strength of conformity in these scenarios. We propose a matrix-factorization-based conformity mod-eling technique to improve the accuracy of rating predic-tion. Experiments show that our model outperforms ex-isting works significantly (with a relative improvement of 11.72% on RMSE). Therefore, we draw the conclusion that conformity modeling is important for understanding user be-haviors and can contribute to further improve the online recommender systems.
 User Behavior, Conformity, Rating Prediction
Conformity implicitly shapes people X  X  behaviors to group norms. The phenomenon widely exists in most communi-ties and various scenarios, from political votings to dinner choices. Plenty of psychological researches aim at study-ing and understanding such behaviors [9]. Experiments also prove the existence and lead to several psychological theo-ries.

Besides traditional real-world experiments, online social networks and services now provide a new opportunity to study and to utilize the social conformity phenomenon. Peo-ple are flooded with other X  X  opinions when surfing the In-ternet. When making choices online, users are normally influenced by these just received opinions to some extent. All the opinions and actions are well recorded by the ser-vice providers as action logs, providing large-scale valuable
Rating prediction is one of the core tasks in recommender system. To accurately solve this task, one must model the user X  X  preferences and capture the item X  X  characteristic pre-cisely. Matrix factorization (MF) is the most widely used tool for this task, which represents both users and items in common low-dimension latent factor space [4]. Researchers later extend the traditional MF approach to further employ social relations [2], cross-domain user histories [6] and etc.
Existing user modeling approaches assume user X  X  actions always reflect their preferences truthfully. However, the as-sumption does not always hold. A study on review-helpfulness voting concludes that users are not always truthful judges. Whether users vote at all, as well as the polarity of their votes, depend highly on the surrounding contents [8]. Kr-ishnan et al. design and conduct a comparative experiment in [5], where users can rate twice before and after being ex-posed to the public opinions. Results prove the existence of conformity in this setting. However, due to the specialty of the experiment X  X  methodology, we can not directly ex-tend the conclusion to general online scenarios where user actions are more freely conducted comparing to actions in the controlled experiment.
Due to the special requirement of conformity modeling, there is no public dataset suitable for this task. Besides rat-ing logs, we also need the public opinions users received right before each rating action. As existing datasets only provide action logs over sampled users, the required information can not be accurately recovered.

We collect and publish a large-scale dataset that satisfies the requirement. The dataset can be freely accessed online 1 . We collect the data from Douban 2 , one of China X  X  largest movie review sites. We randomly sample 5,000 movies with more than 50 actions, and dump ALL rating actions for these movies. In total, we obtain 17,142,351 rating actions from 1,757,451 users. We recover the public opinions user re-ceived right before each rating action, including the number of reviewers, the average rating, and also the rating distri-bution for the target movie (how many reviewers rates 1-5 stars respectively).
In this section, we demonstrate the existence of conformity in online rating sites by statistical analysis.

We show the correlation between the ratings given by users and the public opinions users received according to each movie. For simplicity, we consider only the averaged rating as the public opinion for analysis. We represent each rating log instance k as ( r k ,p k ), where r k is the rating and p k is the averaged rating right before the action. For each movie, we group its rating logs by similar p k , and report the average r k for each group as the indicator of the rating distribution under that specific public opinion. We plot the results for four randomly selected movies in Figure 2. As we can notice, the rating distributions (the mean) clearly correlate with the public opinions users received.

Now we demonstrate the conformity phenomenon widely exists among most movies. Note that we can only conduct http://dataset.apexlab.org/conformity http://www.douban.com/ where  X  t is the set of parameters. Experiments and online applications both indicate that matrix factorization can suc-cessfully capture the users X  preferences towards the items.
Instead of using the preference-based estimation directly as the rating modeling ( X  r ui = t ui ), we integrate it with con-formity modeling. Specifically, we model the user X  X  final model, t ui is the prediction of traditional preference-based model, p ui is the public opinion user u receives right before she rates item i ,  X  C is the set of parameters.

Now we discuss the design of the conformity model C . As conformity is a group phenomenon, factors such as group size, unanimity and cohesion affect the level of conformity an individual displays. Therefore, we first propose the basic conformity model and then extend it for specific aspects in the following subsections.
We model the user X  X  biased rating by linear combination of pure preference-based estimation and the influence of public opinion due to conformity. For public opinions, we have p ui = ( c ui ,a ui ,d ui ), where c ui is the number of ratings for movie i before user u rates it, a ui is the average rating and d ui is the rating distribution. Examples are showed in Figure 1. In the basic model we only consider the average rating a ui . We use a hyper-parameter  X  to tune the strength of conformity. The rating prediction model is now: C
B ( t ui ,p ui ) = (1  X   X  )  X  t ui +  X   X  a ui
We employ stochastic gradient descent for the parameter learning. The inference of the gradients as well as the loss function are mostly the same as traditional matrix factor-ization, thus we skip them here.
Group size is an important factor for modeling the con-formity strength. Opinions from few people might be con-sidered as coincidence, while the voice of the crowd can not be ignored. In the rating site scenario, the group size is the number of raters for the movie ( c ui ). For example, knowing that 5 people like the movie might not affect the user a lot. However, when the group size increases to thousands, the conformity strength also boosts.

Therefore, instead of setting conformity strength with con-stant value as in the basic model, now we model it based on the group size. We model the conformity strength as a func-tion of the group size. Considering the intuitive properties of conformity, we design the function to satisfies the followings: (a) non-linear; (b) monotone increasing; (c) with constrained range; (d) has a  X  X ipping point X  to model the  X  X hreshold X  of group size for conformity. For computational convenience, we also require the function to be differentiable. To achieve the requirements, we employ the extended sigmoid function  X  ( x ) defined as follows: where  X  a , X  b control the overall scale of conformity strength and  X , X  control the shape as well as the  X  X ipping point X . The model is now:
We evaluate our conformity-based models as well as sev-eral state-of-the-art rating prediction models in the experi-ments. The models are listed as follows: UserAvg, ItemAvg: Directly predict by user/item X  X  av-erage rating according to training logs.
 PMF: Probabilistic matrix factorization proposed in [7]. BiasedMF, SVD++: Original and revised version in [3]. CM-B, CM-S, CM-C: Conformity models proposed in this paper, according to C B , C S , C C in Section 5 respectively.
All dimensions for latent factors are set to 5. Parameters are set by cross validation. We use 80% of data for training set and the rest 20% for testing.
We show the experimental results in Table 1, which indi-cate the conformity models proposed in this paper out per-form the state-of-the-art approaches that depend only on the rating matrix.

Conformity Strength. The parameter  X  in the basic conformity model (CM-B) can be viewed as an indicator of conformity strength.  X  = 0 degenerates the model to the traditional matrix factorization model (BiasedMF), and  X  = 1 indicates users always follow the public opinion. By cross validation, we set  X  to 0.9. The value is rather large and indicates strong conformity phenomenon in rating sites. Conformity vs Group Size. By comparing results of CM-B and CM-S, we conclude the conformity strength does depend on the group size (number of raters for the item). By examining the parameters, we find that the conformity strength ranges over 0.4627 to 0.8868 for only 1 raters and infinite raters respectively.

Conformity vs Cohesion. Result of CM-C indicates the cohesion also contributes to the conformity-behavior. Due to the complexity of the decision trees, we do not de-pict them here. We notice that there are plenty of nodes in the decision trees use the normalized rating distribution (percentage) as the splitting criteria.

Effect of Training Ratio. We vary the training data ratio from 50% to 80% and show the results in Table 2. As we can notice, the performance of conformity model is rather robust to the training ratio. When training ratio drops from 80% to 50%, the performances of CM-B and CM-C only drop by less than 0.01 for both MAE and RMSE For CM-C, the performance drops slightly increases due to the learning requirement of GBRT (0.0194 and 0.0189 and for the two metrics). Note that the value is still better than traditional approaches. This is because conformity model captures user behaviors in general instead of personalized, thus suffers less from the cold-start problem comparing to traditional approaches.
In this paper, we model the conformity phenomenon in online rating sites to understand the user behaviors and to improve the rating prediction accuracy. Specifically, we cap-
