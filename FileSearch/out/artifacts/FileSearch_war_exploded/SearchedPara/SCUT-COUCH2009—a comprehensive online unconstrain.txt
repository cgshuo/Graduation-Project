 ORIGINAL PAPER Lianwen Jin  X  Ya n G a o  X  Gang Liu  X  Yunyang Li  X  Kai Ding Abstract A comprehensive online unconstrained Chinese handwriting dataset, SCUT-COUCH2009, is introduced in this paper. As a revision of SCUT-COUCH2008 [ 1 ], the SCUT-COUCH2009 database consists of more datasets with larger vocabularies and more writers. The database is built to facilitate the research of unconstrained online Chinese hand-writing recognition. It is comprehensive in the sense that it consists of 11 datasets of different vocabularies, named GB1, GB2, TradGB1, Big5, Pinyin, Letters, Digit, Sym-bol, Word8888, Word17366 and Word44208. In particular, the SCUT-COUCH2009 database contains handwritten sam-ples of 6,763 single Chinese characters in the GB2312-80 standard, 5,401 traditional Chinese characters of the Big5 standard, 1,384 traditional Chinese characters corresponding to the level 1 characters of the GB2312-80 standard, 8,888 frequently used Chinese words, 17,366 daily-used Chinese words, 44,208 complete words from the Fourth Edition of  X  X he Contemporary Chinese Dictionary X , 2,010 Pinyin and 184 daily-used symbols. The samples were collected using PDAs (Personal Digit Assistant) and smart phones with touch screens and were contributed by more than 190 persons. The total number of character samples is over 3.6million. The SCUT-COUCH2009 database is the first publicly avail-able large vocabulary online Chinese handwriting database containing multi-type character/word samples. We report some evaluation results on the database using state-of-the-art recognizers for benchmarking.

OHCCR is a key technology for the input method for many portable devices, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), smart mobile phones, Tablet PCs, Electronic Learning Machines (ELM) etc. Since different people have different writing styles, a large scale online database of handwriting samples contributed by many writers is crucial for the development of a high-performance online handwriting recognizer.

Since 1993, the UNIPEN project has organized the collection of online handwritten characters from several countries [ 3 , 4 ]. In recent decades, numbers of handwriting databases have been published in the literature. To name a few, for offline databases, there are the English databases such as CENPARMI [ 5 ] and CEDER [ 6 ], French data-base IRONOFF [ 7 ], Indian database ISI [ 8 ], Japanese/Kanji database ETL-8/ETL-9 [ 10 ], Chinese databases of IAAS-4M [ 11 ], HCL2000 [ 12 ] and HIT-MW [ 13 ]. For online databases, there are the online Japanese databases Kuchibue and Nakayosi [ 9 ], and recently the publicly available online Chinese handwritten database of CASIA-OLHWDB1 [ 14 ] and SCUT-COUCH2008 [ 1 ], resulting in powerful promo-tion and rapid development of handwritten character recogni-tion. In particular, it has been noted that in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in building publically acces-sible ground-truth databases for different languages, such as the online Chinese character database [ 14 ], Arabic offline handwritten character database [ 15 ], handwritten offline Spanish text database [ 16 ], Farsi handwritten text database [ 17 ], etc.

In short, the development of handwriting databases shows definite trends. First, the collection of categories has devel-oped from a small range into a large collection. Second, the scale of sampling has grown from single characters to words, text lines and paragraphs. Third, the manner of handwriting styles has changed from regular to cursive and unconstrained forms.

In the field of online handwritten Chinese character recognition, although many key players, such as HanWang Technology in China, PenPower Technology in TaiWan, Microsoft and Motorola in the United States, have their own non-public handwritten database, no one is willing to share theirdatabasewithotherresearchersinthefield.Uptonow,to thebestofourknowledge,thereareonlytwoonlinehandwrit-ing Chinese character databases, SCUT-COUCH2008 [ 1 ] and CAISA-OLHWDB1 [ 14 ], which have both been made publicly available.

CAISA-OLHWDB1 is a database that is freely available to the academic community and was released in 2009 [ 14 ]. It contains 4,037 characters (3,866 Chinese characters and 171 symbols) written by 420 people. Although it is contributed by many writers, CAISA-OLHWDB1 does not yet include samples of words, traditional Chinese characters, complete GB2312-80 level 2 Chinese characters and Pinyin.

SCUT-COUCH2009 is a revision of SCUT-COUCH 2008 which was first released in 2008 [ 1 ]. It has the follow-ing improvements: (1) Many more samples were collected and contributed by more than 190 different people. (2) The 5401 Big5 traditional character set was added. (3) All word phrases of the Fourth Edition of  X  X he Contemporary Chinese Dictionary (Fourth Edition) X , an official popular Chinese word dictionary, were added. (4) The number of datasets was increased from the original 8 to 11 in SCUT-COUCH2009.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives a brief description of the SCUT-COUCH2009 database. In Sect. 3 , general consideration on how to design and build the SCUT-COUCH2009 database is presented. Ground-truth processing of the database is given in Sect. 4 . The analysis of the database is presented in Sect. 5 . Section 6 presents benchmark testing of the database using a state-of-the-art recognizer. Section 7 concludes this paper. 2 A brief description of the database SCUT-COUCH2009 was built for the purpose of providing researchers in the field of online handwritten Chinese rec-ognition a refined online Chinese database with training and testing samples, and also provides a standard publicly avail-able database for comparing and evaluating the performance of different algorithms.

Compared with the databases mentioned earlier, the proposed SCUT-COUCH2009 database has the following special characteristics: First, SCUT-COUCH2009 is a com-prehensive online unconstrained database composed of 11 datasets as shown in Table 1 . Second, it is the first pub-licly available Chinese handwriting database to include word samples. Some currently available online Chinese handwrit-ing databases, such as HCL2000 and CAISA-OLHWDB1, provide only samples of single characters. The lack of a data-base of Chinese words confines Chinese handwriting rec-ognition to the level of single character recognition, leav-ing Chinese word/text recognition barely addressed in the literature. Third, it is the first publicly available online handwriting database that covers the Chinese Pinyin col-lections. More frequently in practice, people can remember the pronunciation of some characters rather than their shape. A handwriting Pinyin input method will be convenient in these situations. Similar solutions have been addressed recently [ 18 ]. An unconstrained handwritten Pinyin dataset is needed to train a robust Pinyin recognition engine. 3 General consideration and preparation for building SCUT-COUCH 2009 database We fully understand, building a comprehensive online handwritten Chinese database means a great amount of work. Since, every stage in the collection of the SCUT-COUCH2009 database, from the selection of participants, sampling devices, the sampling of writers to the establish-ment of sampling rules is carefully planned and considered. In this section, we will introduce the process we used to accomplish the complete preparation for the building of the SCUT-COUCH database. 3.1 Program design After analyzing and comparing currently available devices for sampling online handwriting, we finally decided to employ five PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant) and five smart mobile phones with touch screens, instead of using trajectory recording pens or tablets as the sampling devices. This was primarily because smart phones and PDAs are more portable and universally used as handwriting input devices in daily life.

As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the input area in our program is designed to be a box of static size, large enough to accom-modate as many characters as may be required. In addition, noticing that most characters have their last strokes ending in the bottom-right corners of the characters, we place the  X  X ave and Continue X  button on the bottom of the input box and thus make it convenient for writers to proceed quickly to the next object after writing a sample. 3.2 Corpus preparation There is always a specific strategy in sampling objects of a handwriting database. For example, HCL2000 took the 3755 frequently used Chinese characters of level 1 in the GB2312-80 standard as sampling objects, while HIT-MW adopted various kinds of paragraphs in China Daily. We also have a strict principle in the choice of sampling materials for SCUT-COUCH2009. 3.2.1 Word picking The vocabulary of Chinese words is extremely large. It would be impossible to collect all the words. Therefore, taking into account the three levels, defined as small, medium and large scale, we build the handwritten Chinese word data-base into three datasets, namely Word8888, Word17366 and Word44208, respectively.

The word corpus of the Word8888 dataset is picked according to the frequencies of usage. We employed the sta-tistics on Chinese word usage frequencies published by the  X  X ogou Labs X  [ 19 ]. The frequency of appearance of 157,202 words in more than 100million web pages is counted in the statistics. In our analysis, we found words that frequently appear on the internet are also continually used in our daily life. Therefore, we intercepted the 8,888 words with the high-est usage frequencies to be word sampling objects, based on the following considerations. On the one hand, we should not make the collection work too burdensome by adopting too large a number of sample objects. Upon such consider-ation, 8,888 frequently used words that involve 19,595 single Chinese characters were picked as an appropriate number. On the other hand, we should not lose universal coverage in daily usage by adopting too small a number of sample objects. As we can see in Fig. 2 , these 8,888 words cover 71.48 % of the daily-used lexicon. We picked 8,888 words because 8,888 is considered a lucky number in China, which makes it easy for everyone to remember.

In particular, the 8,888 words we chose involved 7,499 two-character words, 984 three-character words, 383 four-character words, 20 five-character words, 1 six-character word and 1 seven-character word (see Fig. 3 ). These words are composed in total of 19,595 single characters, covering 2,078 characters among the 3,755 characters in the GB Set1, with only 26 characters belonging to the GB Set2, which also indicates that characters in GB Set1 are the most frequently used in daily life. The corpus of the Word17366 dataset is picked from PowerWord,themostpopulardigitalChinesedictionarysoft-ware developed by the KingSoft Company [ 20 ]. We manu-ally picked 17,366 daily-used words as our sampling objects for building a middle scale handwritten word dataset, which involves 14,822 two-character words, 1,195 three-character words and 1,349 four-character words. As the corpus of the Word8888 dataset was picked from websites, we hope that picking the corpus of words from the most popular digital dictionary software provides an alternative representation.
To build a large vocabulary and relatively complete word database, we built the third word dataset, the Word44208 dataset, which includes all word phrases except 4 long-char-acter words that consisted of more than 12 characters from an official Chinese dictionary,  X  X he Contemporary Chinese Dictionary X  (Fourth Edition). This dataset contains 44,208 words in total. As shown in Fig. 4 , it involves 34,039 two-character words, 6,517 three-character words, 2,722 four-character words, 531 five-character words, 252 six-character words, 73 seven-character words, 41 eight-character words, 19 nine-character words, 9 ten-character words, 4 eleven-character words and 1 twelve-character-word. In total, there are 103,840 single characters which cover 3,643 characters in level 1 of the GB2312-80 standard and 1,781 characters in level 2 of the GB2312-80 standard.

It is worth noting that the vocabularies of the three vocab-ularies overlap. In fact, there are 4,952 common words shared between the Word8888 and Word17366 datasets, 4,713 words shared by the Word8888 and Word44208 data-sets, and 11,907 words shared between the Word17366 and Word44208 datasets.

There were several words which consisted of more than 12 characters when we collected the original handwritten samples from the contents of  X  X he Contemporary Chinese Dictionary X  (Fourth Edition) (in fact there are 1 twelve-char-acter word, 1 thirteen-character word, 1 sixteen-character word and 1 seventeen-character word). As it is hard to write these words in one line on a PDA, most of them are written in two lines. Figure 5 shows some long words as handwritten samples. The bottom-left sample shown in Fig. 5 contains as many as 17 characters. However, these long-characters words provide us with a type of text sample rather than word sample. Therefore, we do not keep them when building the dataset of the Word44208. Instead, we build a separate subset for them, which is not released in the current version of the SCUT-COUCH2009 database but is available from us upon request via email. 3.2.2 Selecting single characters We selected all 3,755 level 1 and all 3,038 level 2 simplified Chinese characters in the GB2312-80 standard as our single simplified body of characters, since the 6,763 characters in the GB2312-80 standard cover more than 99.9 % of daily usage in China.

Furthermore, noticing that traditional Chinese characters are also used occasionally, an appropriate range of traditional Chinese characters is also listed in our database. Two tra-ditional Chinese character datasets, the Big5 and TradGB1 were designed. The Big5 contains 5,401 traditional Chinese characters, which are widely used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In China, as about 99 % of daily-used characters are covered within the GB2312-80 level 1, the set of TradGB1 traditional Chinese character samples is obtained by the transformation of the 3,755 simplified Chinese characters in the GB Set1 to their traditional forms. In particular, different traditional forms may be found in different lexicons for the same sim-plified character (see examples shown in Table 2 ). Finally, 1,384 traditional Chinese characters are collected as a merger of the sets found in different lexicons (including GBK and GB18030-2000). 3.2.3 Selection of pinyin material In the pronunciation of Mandarin, every kind of spelling may have as many as 5 different tones including the surd, such as shi( ), sh  X   X ( ), sh X ( ), sh  X  i( ) and sh X ( ). Although, it is more often the case that one kind of spelling has only 4 or less tones with the corresponding Chinese character. For example, no character exists relating to the pronunciation li X . Through analyzing the pronunciations of the lexicon of GB2312-80, we acquired a collection of Pinyin involving 415 kinds of spelling (regardless of tone) and 1,426 enun-ciations (considering tones). After excluding some spellings that are rarely used (such as hng, hm, ng, etc.), a lexicon of 402 types of spelling was obtained. All 5 tones of every spell-ing were included into our dataset (2,010 in total), regardless of whether or not they really have a corresponding Chinese character, due to the following concerns. First, this strategy results in five samples for every spelling, and thus increases the statistical stability of handwritten spellings. Second, it facilitates the analysis of the difference between different tones of the same spelling. Third, being a widely used and developing language, Chinese pronunciations may change along with the emergence of new characters. 3.2.4 Selection of other materials Aside from materials mentioned earlier, we also preserved the involvement of some regular materials, including 10 numeric digits, 52 upper-and lower-case English alphabeti-cal characters and 122 frequently used symbols (see Fig. 6 ). 3.3 Writer diversities Generally, our strategy in selecting candidate writers combined deliberation with randomness. Deliberately, we selected two groups of writers from two cities in China, Guangzhou (a southern China city) and Hefei (a middle northern China city). A total of 194 different people con-tributed to the collection of the database. Most writers were students from universities, which were suitable for the fol-lowing reason. College students are enrolled from all over the country, so that their handwriting samples may be con-sidered as samples written by users from different regions of the country.

With the general range of candidate writers confirmed, we started a random selection of writers. As shown in the follow-ing tables (Tables 3 , 4 , 5 ), the randomly employed writers indicated a balanced distribution by region, age and sex. 3.4 Policies of samples collection To collect patterns useful for developing powerful online handwriting recognizers in practical applications, the follow-ing policies were employed in the collecting procedure: (1) All sets of samples were written by many different writ-(2) Writers were asked to input handwritings in the input (3) Writers were aware that every object was an integral (4) Writers were asked to perform handwriting in their most (5) Writers were ignorant about the database X  X  potential (6) A continuous duration of each sampling was confined to 4 Ground-truth processing With all sets of data completely sampled by more than 190 writers individually, we started to check and store the collected data. A helpful form of word labeling was also performed, which will be discussed in this section. 4.1 Error correction For the purpose of error correction, samples of the SCUT-COUCH2009canbecheckedwithatooldevelopedbyus.For example, as shown in Fig. 7 a, there are four samples , which are written by four people individually. But the fourth person wrongly writes as . The checker can move the mouse to the fourth character and a green box will appear. By pressing the right button, the  X  X elete X  or  X  X odify X  option can be selected in the pop-up menu. If the  X  X odify X  option is chosen, a new layout will be launched as illustrated in Fig. 7 a. The sample can be rewritten in the white area shown in Fig. 7 b.

The person was asked to rewrite his/her error samples in the correction process. However, in some cases when the number of error samples was few (usually no more than 20) and the original person was not available at that moment, we used our laboratory personnel to make such corrections.
While checking the collected data, we found few sam-ples with unacceptable errors. As shown in Fig. 8 a, some samples involve sudden excursion on the trajectories, caused by occasional malfunctions in the hardware of the touch screens. The other errors were not caused by hardware but by subjective mistakes, which were also not beneficial for analyzing the disciplines of Chinese handwriting. Figure 8 b shows that some words were wrongly writ-ten as and , while the correct words should have been required to be corrected. Meanwhile, we preserved these error samples in case of special research needs. 4.2 Database labeling To make the handwritten word samples available for seg-mentation-based research, we segmented the 8,888 Chinese word samples into single characters and manually labeled each character. Our method was to record the bounding box ofeverysinglecharacteraswellastheindicesofthestrokesin each character. The labeling of word samples was meaning-ful for three reasons. First, it provided ground-truth data for conductingresearchonChinesecharactersegmentation.Sec-ond, all single characters were separated and hence enriched the samples of isolated characters and also provided samples for special research purposes, such as writer adaptation using incremental samples. Last but not least, it offered informa-tion on both the spatial and temporal relationships between character members of a Chinese word.

All the labeling of words was conducted on a PC using a semi-automatic tool. Figure 9 a shows some of the labeled word samples. Similarly, we also labeled Chinese Pinyin samples in our datasets, enriching all kinds of samples of let-ters that were written by one person. Figure 9 b shows some of the labeled Pinyin samples. 4.3 Fundamental structure of the database All the handwritten character/word sample files of SCUT-COUCH2009 share the same storage data structure. Each file contains various handwriting samples, which are stored sequentially. Each handwritten sample consists of a number of strokes, where each stroke consists of writing points. The data structure of the handwritten sample contains general description information such as the corresponding GB code, total stroke number, total point number, etc., and detail data storage organization information, which is given in Table 6 . 5 Data analysis The SCUT-COUCH2009 database is not only a publicly available online unconstrained Chinese handwriting data-base, but also innovatively contains multi-type sample objects, which is useful for online Chinese handwriting recognition. Figure 10 shows some samples in the differ-ent datasets of the SCUT-COUCH2009. In this section, we briefly introduce both statistical information and some char-acteristics of our database. 5.1 Statistical discipline of strokes The statistics of the stroke number is analyzed for the range of 8,888 words in 130 sets of samples, which is shown in Fig. 11 .FromFig. 11 , we come to the following conclu-sions. First, many Chinese characters are written cursively, with two or more strokes connected, since the average stroke number of the handwritten samples is much less than that of standard characters. Second, some Chinese words are even cursively written in one stroke. Third, the stroke number of every word varies from sample to sample, instead of being identical with the standard. Fourth, the rule-less number of strokes also reflects the original writing styles of different writers, giving proof to the unconstrained characteristic of the SCUT-COUTH database. 5.2 Handwriting diversities in SCUT-COUCH2009 Every writer has his or her own writing style. Even if written by the same person, the shape of a character may differ from timetotime.Moreover,asdifferenttypesofsamplingdevices were used in the collection, data of rich diversity were pre-sented in our collected data. The following describes some special characteristics of our database.  X  Different styles written by the same person: Different  X  Aliasing: Aliasing may sometimes appear on writing tra- X  Disconnected stroke: There can be a situation where a  X  Redundant stroke: Some writers were used to making a  X  Missing stroke: Some small strokes were missed out in  X  Over-connected stroke: In the writing process, even  X  Mis-written traditional Chinese characters: When col- X  Rewritten stroke: Occasionally, when writers found some It is worth mentioning that in order to keep the handwrit-ing diversities in SCUT-COUCH2009, most of the samples which were mis-written in traditional form or with rewrit-ten strokes were not asked to be rewritten in the correction process. However, if a sample was written too badly to be recognized by a human, it was corrected.  X  Style variation of different writers: Being a flexible form 6 Benchmark evaluations The classifier we used is a state-of-the-art compact MQDF classifier proposed by Teng Long and Lianwen Jin [ 21 ]. After extraction of the 8-directional features [ 22 ], the dimensions of the original feature vector (512D) is reduced by LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis). Then a two-level minimum distance coarse classifier was designed for the purpose of speeding up the recognition process. The first-level coarse classifier uses the first 16 dominant LDA features for clas-sification and generates about 300 candidates for the sec-ond level coarse classifier. The second level coarse classifier uses 160 dominant LDA features and generates 20 candidates for the MQDF classifier, which outputs the final recognition result. The MQDF parameters are compressed using a split vector quantization technique to form the final compact dic-tionary.

Experimental results on all 8 single character datasets and the Word8888 dataset of SCUT-COUCH2009 are given in Table 7 . It is worthwhile noting that for the recognition of the Pinyin dataset and the Word8888 dataset, a holistic approach [ 23 ] was used here. For each dataset, we randomly chose 80 % of the set as the training set and the remaining 20 % as the testing set.

Experiments on the recognition of various combina-tions of different datasets were also conducted, with the results shown in Table 8 . It is worthwhile noting that for  X  X B1+GB2+Pinyin X  and  X  X B1+GB2+Word8888 X , the same recognizer was used for both character and pinyin/word samples. This means that a Pinyin sample and a word sample were treated as a character in the same way. Another point that should be noticed is that for the case  X  X B1+GB2+Big5 X , among the total 12,164 categories of characters, there are 3,328 categories that are the same between GB1+GB2 and Big5. After merging the same categories, the actual cate-gory number of the combination of datasets GB1, GB2 and Big5 was 8,836.  X  X B1+GB2+Big5+Symbol+Letter+Digit X  was also treated in the same way.

From Table 7 , it can be seen that the recognition rates for the Pinyin dataset, Letter dataset and Symbol dataset are not good enough. This may be due to the fact that there are many similar and confusable characters in these datasets, such as  X  X  X  and  X  X  X ,  X  X  X  and  X  X  X ,  X  X  X  and  X  X  X , and tional Chinese character datasets GB1, GB2 and Big5, the Top 1 recognition accuracies are relatively higher, but still less than 96 %, indicating there is still much room to study the problem of unconstrained online Chinese character rec-ognition. From Table 8 , wecanseethat for thecombinationof different datasets, the Top 1 recognition accuracies are even lower. This demonstrates that the problem of hybrid recog-nition of Chinese/Pinyin/Symbol/English/Digit/Word is still a challenging problem that needs a lot of research effort to address. It is also observed from Tables 7 and 8 that the Top 2 recognition rates are significantly higher than the Top 1 recognition rates. This may be due to the fact that there are many similar confusable character-pairs in the datasets, such as and and and in the GB1 dataset,  X  X  X  and  X  X  X ,  X  X  X  and  X  X  X ,  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  in the Letter dataset and so on. Therefore, the recognition accuracy is greatly increased naturally when taking into account of the Top 2 recognition candidates.
 To test the recognition accuracy for Word17366 and Word44208, we used a segmentation-based classification approach as mentioned in [ 24 ]. The results are given in Table 9 . It can be seen from Table 9 that the accuracy is less than 90 % for most word datasets, indicating the problem of unconstrained handwritten Chinese word recognition is an even more challenging problem and is far from being solved.
Comparing the recognition results on Word8888 shown in Table 9 with the last row of Table 7 , we find that using a holistic approach for word recognition achieves a much higher performance. This indicates that the holistic approach may be a good choice for the recognition of handwritten word samples. However, with the increase of categories of words (for example, more than 17,000 for the Word17366 dataset and more than 44,000 for the Word44208 dataset), it would be very difficult and not be feasible to train a rec-ognizer using the holistic approach, since the parameters of the MQDF classifier would become very large, and it may cause the singularity problem [ 25 ] when applying the LDA and MQDF due to the small number of word samples in the same class. 7 Conclusions and discussion The multi-type online unconstrained Chinese handwriting database SCUT-COUCH2009 has important features that are not available in other databases. It is a comprehensive online unconstrained handwritten database composed of 11 datasets. It is the first publicly available online handwritten Chinese character database that involves a multi-type cor-pus of words such as Chinese words and Chinese Pinyins. The collection of the SCUT-COUCH2009 database was con-ducted under the supervision of carefully designed strategies. Fromtheselectionofmaterialandsamplingdevices,thesam-pling of writers, to the establishment of sampling rules, all are elaborately designed.

The SCUT-COUCH2009 promises many more substan-tial applications than online isolated character recognition. A number of novel research topics could be promoted with the assistance of our database, such as hand-written Pinyin recognition, online handwritten Chinese word segmentation and recognition, hybrid handwritten Chinese/English/Digit/Word /Symbol/Pinyin recognition, incremental learning for writer adaptation [ 26 ], and so on.
We are still extending our database, and one study we are working on is to build an online handwriting sentence/text dataset, which is in the process of being collecting now and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The corpus in text dataset comes from news of different topics from the China People X  X  Daily, dated from 2009/01/01-2009/06/31, including international, domestic, economic, cultural and sporting news, scientific education weekly, academic trends and so on. We are collecting the handwritten text data with two devices, one is a PC with touch screen, and the other is a ZPen digital pen [ 27 ]. This dataset will be released on the SCUT-COUCH website ( http://www.hcii-lab.net/data/ scutcouch/ ) when it is available.

The SCUT-COUCH2009 databases we collected are just a starting point for promoting research work in the area of online handwritten character recognition. To develop a high-performance online handwriting recognition engine, a much larger scale of databases contributed by hundreds or even thousands of people may be needed. Furthermore, the collection of handwriting character samples is never com-plete, since people X  X  handwriting styles change as genera-tions change, and also as the writing instruments change with the advance of hardware. With the progress of hand-writing recognition technology, more and more challenging data will become necessary, such as realistic cursive char-acter sentences/paragraph samples. Therefore, it would be fair to say that the task of online data collection is a journey without an end.

All the datasets of the SCUT-COUCH2009 database are freely accessible to researchers in the community and its lat-est information is available at http://www.hcii-lab.net/data/ scutcouch/ . More information is also available upon request (please email to lianwen.jin@gmail.com ).
