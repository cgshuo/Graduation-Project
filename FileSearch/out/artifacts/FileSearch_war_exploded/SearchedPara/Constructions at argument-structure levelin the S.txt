 Glo ` ria Va  X  zquez 1  X  Ana Ferna  X  ndez-Montraveta 2 Abstract In this paper we present the annotation scheme of constructions at the argument-structure level in the Spanish and Catalan Corpora SenSem. Constructions are accounted for as form-meaning pairs following the theoretical underpinning of Construction Grammar. Regarding meaning, we propose a hierarchy of construc-tions taking into account, at the highest level, the prominence of the logical subject in the sentence. Thus, we differentiate between topicalized and detopicalized sen-tences, which is an innovative proposal to solve some terminological issues related to pronominal constructions in Spanish. We further develop this classification taking into account the semantic relation of the logical subject with the verb and its coindexation, if any, with other participants. As regards form, the basic features we consider are syntagmatic categories and syntactic functions. Furthermore, we annotate the form the verb requires, that is, if it requires a pronoun in order to convey a particular meaning. Other relevant contributions are the annotation of some linguistic phenomena not taken into account in other similar resources, such as reciprocal, dative or impersonal constructions. Finally, we present the frequencies of all these constructions in Spanish.
 Keywords Constructions Subcategorization frames Argument structure Topicalization Detopicalization Pronominal constructions In this paper we present the annotation scheme for the argument-structure level in the Spanish and Catalan SenSem (acronym for Sentence Semantics) Corpora (SSC). 1 The annotation of this linguistic level in our corpus is carried out within the theoretical framework of Construction Grammar. Prototypically, information about subcategorization frames includes syntagmatic categories, semantic roles and syntactic functions. In our approach, we add another layer of semantic information at the clause level by providing an overall tag for each configuration. As we will see, the addition of this overall semantic tag is key to complete the description of subcategorization patterns, which otherwise might be ambiguous.

The most prominent contributions of our annotation scheme for constructions at this level are fourfold. First, we propose an innovative and coherent classification of constructions to solve some terminological problems in the field. Second, we present a more consistent analysis of the called  X  X  X ronominal constructions X  X  in Spanish and Catalan. Third, we annotate some phenomena that have not been taken into account in other resources, such as reciprocal, impersonal and dative constructions. And last, from a formal point of view, in SenSem we have annotated the possible changes that the verb form undergoes to express a specific clausal meaning (i.e. if it requires a pronoun or a periphrastic form or if it does not).
We have made available several interfaces to view corpora information. To see data regarding argument structure we can use the general corpus interface, 2 where users can query the DB to find out verbs and sentences associated with a given construction. In addition, users can view information using the subcategorization interface. 3 This interface allows us to obtain the list of all the constructions for each language regardless of the verb they are associated with. Finally, we have created a verbal lexicon where the subcategorization frames for each verb sense can be visualized. 4 Both corpora can be downloaded from our website in XML format. 5
In Sect. 2 we will review other corpora that have been annotated with information related to argument-structure for English, Spanish and Catalan and compare them to SenSem. Also, we will present some proposals for the classification of argument-structure patterns found in the literature and we will see how they relate to our proposal. Section 3 describes the methodology used in the process of creation and annotation of the corpora. In Sect. 4 , we present an overall description of the annotation scheme of constructions at the argument-structure level in SSC and we present examples from the Spanish corpus. 6 Section 5 shows some results about the frequency of the most important phenomena commented on. Finally, Sect. 6 is devoted to present the conclusions. In this section we review other corpora annotated with information related to argument-structure for English, Spanish and Catalan (Sect. 2.1 ) and other approaches to the study and classification of verb subcategorization and clause constructions (Sect. 2.2 ). 2.1 Corpora annotated at the argument-structure level In most research in this field, argument structure is defined by annotating syntagmatic categories and syntactic and semantic functions. The most popular corpora with information at the argument-structure level for English are PropBank 7 (Palmer et al. 2005 ) and FrameNet 8 (Ruppenhofer et al. 2010 ). The former adds a semantic layer to the Penn Treebank by manually assigning semantic roles to verb arguments. The Penn Treebank contains approximately 2 million words with 3342 verbs annotated for skeletal syntactic structure. Most of these verbs (77.22 %) have been assigned to just one frameset, and should therefore be considered monosemic. The rest have more than one and, thus, are polysemic. As for the number of sentences associated to each sense, most verbs have only one or two examples.
FrameNet is a resource built following the theory of Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1976 ) and contains around 100 millions of words (from the British National Corpus) and 190,000-tagged sentences. Along with the semantics of the arguments, the syntax is also annotated in terms of syntagmatic categories and functions. FrameNet has also been developed for Spanish (Subirats-Ru  X  ggeberg and Petruck 2003 ), although it is somewhat smaller than the English resource. In this resource there are 10,334 9 sentences annotated assigned to 1124 lexical units. That is, the average is 9.19 sentences per lexical unit. The Spanish FrameNet has been annotated using both manual and automatic methods.
 For Spanish there are two other corpora of our interest, Ancora and BDS: Base de Datos Sinta  X  cticos del Espan  X  ol Actual (Syntactic Database of Current Spanish). Ancora (Taule  X  et al. 2008 ) is also available in Catalan. It is composed of about 500,000 words for each language. In the case of the Catalan version, they claim to have fully annotated the corpus but in the case of the Spanish corpus only 187,000 words have been fully annotated. These resources provide mainly information about argument structure defined in terms of syntactic functions and categories, and the semantic labeling of arguments. Following Aparicio et al. ( 2008 ), in an extract of 100,000 words of the Spanish corpus, there is a total amount of 11,061 verbal tokens, corresponding to 2613 senses. For Catalan, a total of 48,319 verbal tokens are identified, corresponding to 4102 senses. If we assume the data provided in Aparicio et al. ( 2008 ) describing the Spanish corpus, for the most frequent 100 senses, 22 have less than 10 examples, 70 less than 50, and the rest (8) more than 50. These data lead us to believe, taking into account the total number of words analyzed in this work, that most of the 2515 remaining verbs would only have one example associated.

BDS (Rojo 2001 ) provides 160,000 clauses (1,449,005 words) that have been manually annotated. Its objective is to offer syntactic information (grammatical functions) and a very basic semantic characterization of arguments (animate vs. inanimate). The project ADESSE (Garc X   X  a de Miguel and Comesan  X  a 2004 ) adds semantic roles to the arguments identified in the BDS. There are about 3400 verb lemmas distributed in 4013 senses. In the corpus, 1278 verbs (31.87 %) have only been associated to one or two examples and 2598 verbs (64.73 %) have been exemplified by 10 sentences or less.

At this point, we would like to highlight two aspects of SenSem in relation to both Ancora and ADESSE. First, we provide a minimum of 120 sentences per lemma and, therefore, the number of examples per sense is higher than in the resources seen so far: 55.21 % of the senses exemplified in the corpus for Spanish have more than 11 sentences and only 9.2 % of the senses have just one example; in Catalan, 33.69 % of the senses have more than 11 examples associated and only 6.81 % have one sentence. Second, even though the number of verbs described is smaller than in other resources, the description of constructions is unique as regards the number of linguistic phenomena covered with the annotation provided at the semantic level, as we will see in the next section. 2.2 Approaches to the study of argument structure In this section we are going to briefly review some approaches to the study and classification of argument structures and subcategorization patterns. One of the most important initiatives in this field, for its comprehensiveness, is the Grammar Pattern Project, 10 which derives from the English Cobuild. In Grammar Patterns they propose a hierarchy of subcategorization frames for English based on the examples extracted from the corpus used (Bank of English). It is a fine-grained classification of English structures and, therefore, language dependent since they include prepositions and other lexical items.

Within the English FrameNet project we can find the English Construction (Fillmore et al. 2012 ). 11 Following the principles of Construction Grammar they put forward a classification of English constructions that goes beyond the description of argument structure since they also account for phrasal and idiomatic constructions, like the Measurement_plus_adjective or Determiner_Noun_Phrase constructions. There have been similar initiatives in some FrameNets for other languages; this is the case of Swedish (Lyngfelt et al. 2012 ). In our proposal we do not account for idiomatic and phraseological constructions since we describe a more general level of word combination, clause level.

Other proposals organize this level of linguistic description hierarchically as is the case of Levin ( 1993 ). In SenSem, constructions defined at argument-structure level are also organized following a hierarchical structure. Like in Levin X  X  proposal, the higher levels of the classification are rather general. For example, the alternations described in Levin within the group Transitivity Alternations : Object of Transitive = Subject of Intransitive Alternations would correspond to the label  X  X  X etopicalized constructions X  X  in SenSem (see Sect. 4.2 ). Also, the alternations described in Levin within Alternations involving arguments within the VP would partially correspond to the constructions labeled as  X  X  X opicalized constructions X  X  in SenSem.
 Nevertheless, there is not a complete correspondence between SenSem and Levin X  X  classification. For example, in her proposal reciprocal alternations are classified within the group Alternations involving arguments within the VP whereas reflexive constructions are regarded an independent group of alternations. In Sensem, reflexive constructions are found as a type of topicalized constructions, whereas reciprocal constructions can be found in both, topicalized and detopicalized situations (see Sect. 4.2 ). Something similar happens with passive structures, which Levin considers independently, while we include them in the group of detopicalized constructions (see also Sect. 4.2 ). On the other hand, our classification remains more general than Levin X  X  since she incorporates in her classification language-related lexical and syntactic elements as is the case of alternations such as X X  X  Way construction or There -insertion . A major difference lies on the theoretical organization of information since we do not adopt the concept of alternation, but rather follow the framework of Construction Grammar (Goldberg 1995 ); each isolated configuration of the argument-structure level is understood and annotated as a pair of form and meaning. The methodology section is divided into two parts. Section 3.1 is devoted to briefly present the constitution of the corpus and in Sect. 3.2 we present the annotation process. 3.1 Corpus composition The Spanish and Catalan SenSem Corpora contain 30,368 and 25,067 annotated sentences respectively. 12 These sentences exemplify the use of 951 verb senses in Spanish and 1291 verb senses in Catalan. The difference in the number of sentences is due to the fact that the Spanish Corpus contains 5301 extra sentences from literary texts belonging to narrative works written in peninsular Spanish in the XXth and XXIst centuries. 13
The annotated clauses are presented contextualized in the sentence so, if we take into account all the words in the context (sentence) the total number of words in the Spanish Corpus is almost one million words (with a total of 455,905 annotated words). As regards the Catalan Corpus, it is made of 700,000 words (with a total of 391,267 annotated words). Even though the SSC can be considered medium-size in number, if we take into account that all the words have been annotated at several levels (lexical, syntagmatic, clausal and sentential semantics) then we must recognize its value for its comprehensive description of meaning. The SSC clauses have been tagged with linguistic information regarding several levels of linguistic analysis, including argument-structure. To see a description of other levels of annotation in SenSem (see Ferna  X  ndez-Montraveta and Va  X  zquez 2014 ). 14 The verb senses exemplified in SenSem can be grouped in about 250 lemmas. The list of lemmas to be included in the corpus was chosen according to their frequency. In order to determine the 250 most frequent verbs in Spanish, we created, automatically, a corpus with 13,000,000 words from the online edition of two of the most popular newspapers in Catalonia, La Vanguardia and El Peri X dico (Alonso et al. 2007 ).

The choice of the journalistic genre as the basis of our corpus was adopted basically for two main reasons. Firstly, the availability of online editions of the newspapers greatly facilitates the collection of data automatically. Secondly, informative journalistic texts are characterized by being varied in nature and include diverse discursive structures such as interviews, news, essays, etc. In the case of Spanish, by adding texts from the literary genre, even if they represent a mere 15 %, we have enhanced the value since it has helped us to exemplify new senses and constructions improving, therefore, the variety of linguistic phenomena collected. 3.2 Annotation process The annotation of the SenSem Corpora started in the year 2004. All along the process, we have had several annotators and two senior members, who established the guidelines for the annotators to follow, trained them and have guaranteed the quality and homogeneity of the process.

In order to ensure homogeneity in the annotation process, we carried out a study to measure inter-annotator agreement. Four members of the team annotated the same 59 sentences, randomly chosen. Once all the sentences had been annotated, we calculated inter-annotator agreement for every one of the levels that describe argument structure, i.e. the argumentality of the participants, the syntactic category and function of the phrases, the semantic labeling of arguments and the semantics of the clause.

First, we determined pair-wise proportions of overall agreement, that is, the ratio of cases in which two annotators agreed with respect to all cases. Also, we calculated the kappa coefficient (Cohen 1960 ), which was used as an indication of the stability and reproducibility of human judgments, taking into account the probabilities of agreement by chance. It must be noted that kappa values tend to be low in general due to the small size of the annotated corpus with which it was calculated and the small number of possible values, which makes chance agreement very probable.

In what follows we will present just a brief overview of some of the values. For a complete description of all of them and the kappa values (see Alonso et al. 2007 ). One of the most important issues is deciding if a participant is an argument or an adjunct. Sometimes this is a straightforward decision but this is not always the case. There seems to be a higher consensus when a participant is considered an argument (82 %), but deciding whether a participant is an adjunct seems to be a more difficult decision (64 %). Kappa values for argumentality in our study range between 0.46 and 0.54, indicating that results are good but reproducibility is not guaranteed.
The average agreement for syntactic categories also varies depending on the category being tagged. The categories most commonly agreed on are some types of subordinate clauses (completive clauses, infinitive clauses, direct speech) with a mean of over 90 % and a kappa above 0.9. The lowest agreement was reached with prepositional clauses with 72 %. All the other categories were placed somewhere between this 72 % and the 98 % of relative pronouns. Kappa values showed a wider range of values, from 0.16 for relative clauses to 1 for negative adverbials. Overall, kappa values for syntactic categories averaged above 0.7, showing good reproducibility for this level of annotation.

The agreement on syntactic functions ranged between 100 % for agentive complements and 66 % for prepositional complements, with lower kappa values for highly infrequent functions and higher values, above 0.7, for frequent ones, except direct object, which had a kappa of 0.63.

Finally, regarding the annotation of semantic roles, the higher agreement was reached for the labels of experiences (97 %) and cause (91 %) and the lowest the non-affected theme (70 %). The more fine-grained the distinctions we make at this level, the lower the agreement became. This could be seen when we subdivided theme into subtypes: non-affected theme, affected-theme, etc. Kappa values for semantic roles were high on average, closely following the figures for agreement.

Generally speaking, we could say that agreement was comparable to that reported in similar projects. For instance, Kingsbur et al. ( 2002 ) report an agreement ranging between 60 and 100 % for predicate-argument tagging within Propbank and in SenSem, all levels of annotation fall clearly within this 60 X 100 % range. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are respectively devoted to explain the formal and semantic aspects considered in this project to define constructions. We will use square brackets to mark the tags included in our annotation scheme (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ). 15 4.1 The form of constructions In order to define constructions formally, we take into account three criteria. First, as can be seen in Fig. 1 , the basic syntactic pattern is established by annotating phrasal categories and their syntactic function.

Second, taking into consideration the function of phrases in the clause, we differentiate two types of constructions depending on the presence/absence of a syntactic subject (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section A1). On the one hand, we have [impersonal constructions] (1), in which the elimination of the logical subject implies that there no longer is a grammatical subject in the sentence and, therefore, it cannot be retrieved. (1) a. Estamos de acuerdo en que arreglen la zona porque da vergu  X  enza co  X  mo
On the other hand, we find sentences in which the subject function can be identified ([non-impersonal constructions]). 19 This is the case of (2a), where a prototypical active sentence is represented. Sometimes, as in (2b), the subject function is not instantiated to a physical constituent because, as it is known, Spanish and Catalan are pro-drop languages, and in these cases the syntactic subject is covert. Finally, in this second group, passive or anticausative constructions, where the logical object acts as the grammatical subject (in contrast to (1b)), are also included (2c). (2) a. El Gobierno vasco elabor X  un plan para erradicar el problema.
Third, constructions are classified into three groups depending on the verb form (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section A2). Thus, in some clauses the verb keeps its form (1a), in others, a [pronominal verb form] 20 is added (1b) and, finally, there are also cases where it takes a [periphrastic verb form]. 21 For example, sentences such as (1c) or (3) are different from the point of view of impersonality, but both coincide in the kind of verb form they take (periphrastic verb group). In (1c), the auxiliary hay ( haber  X  X o have to/need X ) followed by a conjunction que ( X  X hat X ) and the infinitive form of the verb is used to express impersonal obligation. In (3), the verb fue ( ser  X  X o be X ) followed by the participle form of the verb is used to build a passive construction (see Sect. 3.2 ). (3) La v X   X  ctima fue alcanzada en un brazo, el abdomen, el glu  X  teo y una pierna.
In summary, both [impersonal] and [non-impersonal constructions] can be expressed by means of a [pronominal verb form] or a [non-pronominal verb form], either a [lexical verb form] or a [periphrastical verb form]. 4.2 The meaning of constructions In order to define the semantics of constructions, we differentiate three levels of specificity. The first level allows us to classify constructions into two big groups taking into account factors related to discourse structure (Sect. 4.2.1 ). The second level permits us to further specify these two main groups by considering the semantic role of the logical subject (Sect. 4.2.2 ). And finally, at the third level, we present those constructions that are of a specific nature; some of them are only possible in one of the two main groups (Sect. 4.2.3 ). 4.2.1 Topicalization versus detopicalization In this level, we distinguish between those constructions in which the logical and grammatical subjects coincide (1) from those in which they do not (2). This allows us to differentiate between sentences in which the logical subject has been [topicalized] 22 versus those in which it is [detopicalized] (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BI). This meaning contrast is basic for many languages, including Spanish, Catalan and English. It allows the user to decide the topic, the element about which he/she is talking: if the speaker decides to provide information about the  X  X  X oer X  X  of an action, the doer will be in the position of syntactic subject; but if the speaker wants to talk about something/someone that  X  X  X eceived X  X  the action, the  X  X  X oer X  X  can be either expressed as an adjunct or be completely left aside.

Finally, in order to relate the form (dealt with in Sect. 3.1 ) and the meaning of constructions, it should be added that the cases of [impersonal constructions] are always cases of [detopicalized] clauses, since in impersonal constructions there is never a syntactic subject. On the other hand, [non-impersonal constructions] can be either [topicalized] or [detopicalized]. 4.2.2 Subspecification according to semantic role labeling In the annotation of clause constituents, the first step is deciding which phrases are arguments and which are adjuncts. Secondly, we annotate all arguments with a semantic tag that identifies the semantic functions (semantic roles) of arguments. Below (Fig. 2 ) we present again Fig. 1 but this time it has been completed with this information. 23
We further classify constructions according to the semantic role the logical subject has in the case of topicalized constructions (or would have in the case of detopicalized) according to the information provided in the lexicon (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BII).
Traditionally, topicalized sentences are considered active sentences and are usually tagged as agentive or causative, and, therefore, they should include an agent or a cause, respectively, in subject position. However, verbs such as querer ( X  X ove X ) (4), tener ( X  X ave X ) (5) or encontrar ( X  X ind X ) (6) cannot be associated with either an agentive or causative interpretation: in the first case (4), the verb describes a mental process, in the second (5) a state and in (6) an event in which the subject is not agentive (control and/or intention over the action is irrelevant for it to happen). In SenSem we would use the tag topicalized to describe these constructions and then further classify them according to the kind of semantic relation performed by the subject, namely experiencer (4), theme (5) and initiator (6). (4) Jacinta nunca le dijo a Pene  X  lope que la quer X a . (5) La residencia tiene 78 plazas en habitaciones habitualmente ocupadas por (6) Al llegar a la puerta del cuarto de la sen  X  ora, en el suelo al lado de la puerta,
As regards detopicalized constructions, the problem is similar since there is not a general term to name them. Thus, we only have available terminology to designate the cases of detopicalization of agents, exemplified in (7), or causes, represented in (8): (7) Se ha anunciado el propo  X  sito de entablar un amplio dia  X  logo pol X   X  tico con los
The first type (detopicalization of agents) is labeled with the term passive , but, in practice, detopicalization of experiencers (9) or initiators (10) is also considered a passive construction, which is not consistent with the definition of the term passive . (9) &gt; Y que  X  se pretende con el acto de man  X  ana? (10) No so  X  lo se pierde dinero, tambie  X  n se pierde el tiempo.

In the Spanish and Catalan literature, different tags are used to refer to detopicalization of causes (8). One of them is pronominal construction , which presents a twofold problem: first, it is a formal tag and, therefore, does not account for the semantics of the sentence and, second, it is ambiguous since most passive structures are also pronominal. Another common term used to refer to detopical-ization of causes in Spanish is construcci X n media ( middle construction ). The use of the adjective  X  X  X edia X  X  ( middle ) also creates a terminological problem in Spanish since middle is also used, following the English tradition, to refer to another kind of construction (see Section 4.3). 4.2.3 Specific constructions At this level we have defined five constructions according to the following semantic information: aspectuality (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BIIIa); coindexation of arguments (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BIIIb); and information provided by specific adjuncts (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BIIIc). 4.2.3.1 Aspectuality We identified three kinds of constructions: middle construc-tion, telic construction and habitual construction. The [middle construction] (11) has been largely studied in the literature both in English (Keyser and Roeper 1984 ; Hale and Keyser 1986 ) and in Spanish (Gra ` cia 1989 ; Cifuentes 1999 ). It denotes a stative sentence describing a property of an object. In our proposal it is part of the group considered within the family of detopicalized constructions. In Spanish it usually requires a pronominal construction. Nevertheless, we have established that the frequency of this construction in the corpus is extremely rare (see Sect. 5 ). (11) Bab Boujloud es una puerta monumental que se abre sobre una inmensa
With the tag [habitual construction] (12) we describe a situation that happens with repeated frequency and, therefore, the verb in the clause does not really refer to any particular event or series of events (Comrie 1976 ). Habitual meaning can be conveyed by topicalized or detopicalized constructions and the verbal form can be pronominal or not, depending on the verb. (12) A los que nos gusta la montan  X  a, a menudo nos acercamos a las zonas del
Regarding the construction we called [telic construction] (13), we use this label to describe pronominal structures in which the role of the pronoun is to bind the event denoted by the verb (Sanz 1995 24 ). This interpretation is only possible as a topicalized construction. (13) Esto le lleva, mientras se come una naranja, a hacer una reflexio  X  n sobre los 4.2.3.2 Coindexation We take into account the coindexation of participants 25 in order to annotate [reflexive] (14) and [reciprocal constructions] (15). (14) En aquel instante se consideraba superior a todos los hombres. (15) Armstrong y Crow se conocieron el oton  X  o pasado en Las Vegas.
Reciprocal constructions can be pronominal or non-pronominal. Symmetric verbs do not require a pronominal construction unless they are lexically pronominal ( encontrarse  X  X o meet X ). Also, symmetric verbs can be found in both topicalized and detopicalizad constructions. Non-symmetric verbs will always require a pronominal construction to express reciprocity and are only found in topicalized constructions. 26 4.2.3.3 The presence of specific adjuncts In Spanish it is possible the use of an extra pronoun, a dative, which adds the construction another participant acting as benefactor, a person with whom a favorable or unfavorable relationship is established, as in (16). This kind of construction is known as [dative construction] and can be used both in topicalized or detopicalized sentences, as in (16). 27 (16) ( ... ) el carnet joven hace an  X  os que no me lo renuevan .
 In this section we are going to present some information about frequency regarding formal and semantic aspects of the constructions. The data presented in this work should be interpreted as tendencies of the language, especially valid for the journalistic domain and, to a lesser extent for the literary register. If we considered other types of registers, such as the conversational register, the data could possibly vary.

In Table 1 , we can see that topicalized constructions are the most common group in the Spanish and Catalan SSC. 28 As can be observed, the general tendency is for the number of detopicalized sentences to be significantly smaller in SSC: almost the 90 % of sentences correspond to topicalization and slightly over 10 % to detopicalization in both languages. Within the set of topicalized constructions, the most relevant group is the one formed by agentive topicalized constructions, followed by stative constructions, whose subject has been labeled as theme. Within the set of detopicalized constructions, the most common case is the one in which an agent is detopicalized, followed by detopicalized causative constructions. 29 As for constructions with an elided subject, the figure is not trivial, since it represents a little more than 25.00 % of the sentences in the corpus.

As concerns the differences between registers, we would like to highlight three aspects from the data reflected in Table 1 . First, in the journalistic register, the tendency to use detopicalization constructions is higher than in the literary register, possibly because in literary texts more personal experiences are narrated. Second, the elision of the subject is more common in the literary register, probably because precision is one of the characteristics of the journalistic register. Finally, as can be seen, the results are quite similar in both languages.

In Table 2 the frequency of other constructions reviewed in Sect. 4.2 is displayed (except for the middle construction since it has only been identified twice in the whole corpus). As can be observed, the most frequent construction is the one we have called habitual construction. We can see that the other 4 constructions (telic, reflexive, reciprocal and dative) represent a really small percentage of sentences in Spanish and Catalan SSC since neither group reaches higher representability than 1%. 30 So, we can consider their use in Spanish/Catalan rather marginal.
Given the figures presented in Table 2 we believe that there are not really significant differences in both languages with the exception of the Dative Construction. We can also note a difference in the frequency of use of this construction in Spanish depending on the register. As can be seen it is approximately four times more common in the literary register. This could be due to the fact that we can find dialogues and more informal writing in books than in newspapers and, thus, subjectivity, expressed by the presence of the dative, is also more present in the former.

Next, we present some data regarding subcategorization frames taking into account their semantics (Table 3 ). As can be seen, we have identified 69 syntactic frames in Spanish and 65 in Catalan. If we consider only formal aspects, only around 25 % of the frames in Spanish and 20 % in Catalan are common to both topicalized and detopicalized constructions. Also, we would like to point out that the variability of possible frames expressing detopicalized constructions is higher even though the number of sentences in the corpus is clearly much lower.
In Table 4 , we present the five most frequent frames in the corpus regardless semantics. As can be observed, the frames are the same for both languages and the figures quite similar. The first frame, which is the prototypical transitive frame, represents almost half the sentences and doubles in frequency the second most common frame.

If we associate semantics to these frames, we see that three of them (2, 3 and 5) are present in both main construction families and the other two (1 and 4) are exclusive of topicalized constructions. Altogether these five frames represent 89.33 % of the Spanish frames and of the total 90.23 % of frames for Catalan.
Below we present Tables 5 and 6 with the percentages for the most frequent frames in both families of constructions, topicalized or detopicalized. As can be seen we present two different percentages; the former represents the percentage of the frame in all the corpus and the latter the percentage of the frame within each family.
In Table 5 , we can see the 9 most frequent frames expressing topicalized constructions from the 39 (35 for Catalan) frames associated with this semantic tag. Again, no remarkable differences between both languages are observed. The first four most frequent frames of this type coincide with the four first most frequent in the corpus (see Table 4 ). The first configuration, a typical transitive structure, represents 48.46 % (51.63 % for Catalan) of all cases while the other next three frames represent a total of 45.05 % (43.01 % for Catalan). The next five most frequent frames present raw frequencies ranging from 100 to 500 sentences and they just suppose a mere 4.87 % (3.57 % for Catalan). The remaining frames (not represented in Table 5 ) correspond to less than 2 % of all the topicalized constructions.

There are 46 frames (45 for Catalan) associated with constructions expressing detopicalization. The six most frequent frames are described in Table 6 . The purely intransitive pronominal frame is by far the most common in both languages (52.87 and 53.74 %), followed by a pronominal pattern with a PP as complement (19.76 and 19.63 %). Then, frequency abruptly descends in the next 4 frames presented. We can add that we have identified 40 (39 for Catalan) frames with less than 100 sentences. They represent only 15.90 % of the sentences in the family of detopicalized constructions (13.68 % for Catalan).
 The first three most frequent frames in Table 6 are pronominal, as is the fifth. This fact proves that pronominal constructions are the most common structure to express detopicalization in Spanish and Catalan (pronominal constructions represent a 70 % of the total of possible frames expressing detopicalization). We need to add that pronominal passives are more common than syntactic passives in Spanish. Probably this is one of the facts that contribute to the high frequency of pronominal constructions. Note that in the Spanish SSC syntactic passives represent 0.22 % (0.27 % in Catalan). In the literary register we have not found any syntactic passive construction at all. 31 In addition, anticausative constructions also require mostly a pronominal structure in this language.

If we compare Spanish and Catalan as regards the information shown in Table 6 we observe that, in general, the results are again quite similar. Nevertheless, it X  X  worth mentioning the slightly lower frequency of the pronominal pattern 3 in Catalan, which is the only impersonal pattern on the table. 32 The reason is that in Spanish the preposition a  X  X o X  is required to introduce direct objects that designate a person. This kind of complement will never become the subject of a pronominal construction of destopicalization (17a) since it is a PP. This requirement does not exist in Catalan so this argument, expressed as a regular NP, becomes the subject in the pronominal passive construction (17b). 33 The consequence is that patterns 1 and 4 (which are personal) have a slightly higher frequency in Catalan. (17) a. En ese caso se contratar X   X  a a novecientos cincuenta mil trabajadores,  X  X n this case, nine thousand five hundred workers would be hired because this is the number of micro-businesses in Spain X .
 More data about pronominal detopicalized constructions are presented in Table 7 . As can be seen, pronominalization is much more common in non-impersonal (93.90 % in Spanish and 92.93 % in Catalan) constructions, such as (2c), than in impersonal (36.88 % in Spanish and 48.42 % in Catalan), as in example (1b). As can be seen, the latter are slightly more frequent in Catalan than in Spanish. This is so because the form of the periphrasis is different in both languages. In Spanish we express obligation using a non-pronominal impersonal verb ( haber que  X  X ave to X ) whereas in Catalan the verb used to express obligation is lexically pronominal ( haver -se de ).

In relation to Table 7 , we also would like to highlight the low frequency of impersonal constructions: 17.34 % (14.06 % in Catalan) in relation to detopicalized constructions and 2.07 % (1.77 % in Catalan) considering the whole corpus. 34 In this article we have presented the annotation scheme for constructions at the argument-structure level used in SSC, which include both a Spanish and a Catalan corpus.
Our main contribution is that we have expanded the traditional annotation of argument structure, i.e. the semantic and syntactic tagging of constituents, by providing information about the meaning of the construction. Thus, SSC constitute a remarkable resource in that they incorporate information about high-level semantics.
If compared to similar resources for other languages, such as English, there are not any other corpora that include a semantic interpretation at the argument-structure level, except for FrameNet. In the case of other Spanish corpora, the other project that annotates this kind of information is BDS-ADESSE but it is not as consistent and comprehensive as SSC. As for Catalan, the SenSem corpus is the only corpus that includes semantic information at the clause level beyond the semantic roles. Furthermore, some of the constructions presented in this paper, such as reciprocal or dative constructions, have been annotated in the Spanish and Catalan corpora for the first time.

At the top level of our hierarchy of constructions at the argument-structure level, the main criterion we have used is the coincidence of the logical subject and the syntactic one. This criterion allows us to group all the sentences in two big categories: according to the topicalization or detopicalization of the logical subject. We would like to point out that we believe that the organization we propose is not necessarily language specific and we think it could be applied to other languages besides Catalan and Spanish, such as English or French.

As regards the results presented, first we would like to highlight some data related to subcategorization frames for both corpus: (1) within the group of topicalized sentences, which is clearly the most frequent construction in the corpus, just two frames represent around 70 % ( NPVNP and NPVPP ); (2) these two frames are represent 65 % of all the sentences in the corpora; (3) detopicalized constructions represent just around 11 % (12.60 % in Catalan) of the total number of sentences; (4) within detopicalized constructions, we also find two pronominal frames ( NP PRON V and NP PRON V PP ) that are approximately 70 % of the examples annotated. Second, there are some interesting differences when comparing journalistic and literary registers in Spanish, e.g. in the case of the elision of the subject, which is much more common in the latter case. Third, some specific constructions, within the topicalization or detopicalization group, such as the telic, the reflexive, the reciprocal or the dative constructions, are extremely marginal in common language use. As has been shown by the analysis of the data, the results in Spanish and Catalan are quite similar.

 Glo ` ria Va  X  zquez 1  X  Ana Ferna  X  ndez-Montraveta 2 Abstract In this paper we present the annotation scheme of constructions at the argument-structure level in the Spanish and Catalan Corpora SenSem. Constructions are accounted for as form-meaning pairs following the theoretical underpinning of Construction Grammar. Regarding meaning, we propose a hierarchy of construc-tions taking into account, at the highest level, the prominence of the logical subject in the sentence. Thus, we differentiate between topicalized and detopicalized sen-tences, which is an innovative proposal to solve some terminological issues related to pronominal constructions in Spanish. We further develop this classification taking into account the semantic relation of the logical subject with the verb and its coindexation, if any, with other participants. As regards form, the basic features we consider are syntagmatic categories and syntactic functions. Furthermore, we annotate the form the verb requires, that is, if it requires a pronoun in order to convey a particular meaning. Other relevant contributions are the annotation of some linguistic phenomena not taken into account in other similar resources, such as reciprocal, dative or impersonal constructions. Finally, we present the frequencies of all these constructions in Spanish.
 Keywords Constructions Subcategorization frames Argument structure Topicalization Detopicalization Pronominal constructions In this paper we present the annotation scheme for the argument-structure level in the Spanish and Catalan SenSem (acronym for Sentence Semantics) Corpora (SSC). 1 The annotation of this linguistic level in our corpus is carried out within the theoretical framework of Construction Grammar. Prototypically, information about subcategorization frames includes syntagmatic categories, semantic roles and syntactic functions. In our approach, we add another layer of semantic information at the clause level by providing an overall tag for each configuration. As we will see, the addition of this overall semantic tag is key to complete the description of subcategorization patterns, which otherwise might be ambiguous.

The most prominent contributions of our annotation scheme for constructions at this level are fourfold. First, we propose an innovative and coherent classification of constructions to solve some terminological problems in the field. Second, we present a more consistent analysis of the called  X  X  X ronominal constructions X  X  in Spanish and Catalan. Third, we annotate some phenomena that have not been taken into account in other resources, such as reciprocal, impersonal and dative constructions. And last, from a formal point of view, in SenSem we have annotated the possible changes that the verb form undergoes to express a specific clausal meaning (i.e. if it requires a pronoun or a periphrastic form or if it does not).
We have made available several interfaces to view corpora information. To see data regarding argument structure we can use the general corpus interface, 2 where users can query the DB to find out verbs and sentences associated with a given construction. In addition, users can view information using the subcategorization interface. 3 This interface allows us to obtain the list of all the constructions for each language regardless of the verb they are associated with. Finally, we have created a verbal lexicon where the subcategorization frames for each verb sense can be visualized. 4 Both corpora can be downloaded from our website in XML format. 5
In Sect. 2 we will review other corpora that have been annotated with information related to argument-structure for English, Spanish and Catalan and compare them to SenSem. Also, we will present some proposals for the classification of argument-structure patterns found in the literature and we will see how they relate to our proposal. Section 3 describes the methodology used in the process of creation and annotation of the corpora. In Sect. 4 , we present an overall description of the annotation scheme of constructions at the argument-structure level in SSC and we present examples from the Spanish corpus. 6 Section 5 shows some results about the frequency of the most important phenomena commented on. Finally, Sect. 6 is devoted to present the conclusions. In this section we review other corpora annotated with information related to argument-structure for English, Spanish and Catalan (Sect. 2.1 ) and other approaches to the study and classification of verb subcategorization and clause constructions (Sect. 2.2 ). 2.1 Corpora annotated at the argument-structure level In most research in this field, argument structure is defined by annotating syntagmatic categories and syntactic and semantic functions. The most popular corpora with information at the argument-structure level for English are PropBank 7 (Palmer et al. 2005 ) and FrameNet 8 (Ruppenhofer et al. 2010 ). The former adds a semantic layer to the Penn Treebank by manually assigning semantic roles to verb arguments. The Penn Treebank contains approximately 2 million words with 3342 verbs annotated for skeletal syntactic structure. Most of these verbs (77.22 %) have been assigned to just one frameset, and should therefore be considered monosemic. The rest have more than one and, thus, are polysemic. As for the number of sentences associated to each sense, most verbs have only one or two examples.
FrameNet is a resource built following the theory of Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1976 ) and contains around 100 millions of words (from the British National Corpus) and 190,000-tagged sentences. Along with the semantics of the arguments, the syntax is also annotated in terms of syntagmatic categories and functions. FrameNet has also been developed for Spanish (Subirats-Ru  X  ggeberg and Petruck 2003 ), although it is somewhat smaller than the English resource. In this resource there are 10,334 9 sentences annotated assigned to 1124 lexical units. That is, the average is 9.19 sentences per lexical unit. The Spanish FrameNet has been annotated using both manual and automatic methods.
 For Spanish there are two other corpora of our interest, Ancora and BDS: Base de Datos Sinta  X  cticos del Espan  X  ol Actual (Syntactic Database of Current Spanish). Ancora (Taule  X  et al. 2008 ) is also available in Catalan. It is composed of about 500,000 words for each language. In the case of the Catalan version, they claim to have fully annotated the corpus but in the case of the Spanish corpus only 187,000 words have been fully annotated. These resources provide mainly information about argument structure defined in terms of syntactic functions and categories, and the semantic labeling of arguments. Following Aparicio et al. ( 2008 ), in an extract of 100,000 words of the Spanish corpus, there is a total amount of 11,061 verbal tokens, corresponding to 2613 senses. For Catalan, a total of 48,319 verbal tokens are identified, corresponding to 4102 senses. If we assume the data provided in Aparicio et al. ( 2008 ) describing the Spanish corpus, for the most frequent 100 senses, 22 have less than 10 examples, 70 less than 50, and the rest (8) more than 50. These data lead us to believe, taking into account the total number of words analyzed in this work, that most of the 2515 remaining verbs would only have one example associated.

BDS (Rojo 2001 ) provides 160,000 clauses (1,449,005 words) that have been manually annotated. Its objective is to offer syntactic information (grammatical functions) and a very basic semantic characterization of arguments (animate vs. inanimate). The project ADESSE (Garc X   X  a de Miguel and Comesan  X  a 2004 ) adds semantic roles to the arguments identified in the BDS. There are about 3400 verb lemmas distributed in 4013 senses. In the corpus, 1278 verbs (31.87 %) have only been associated to one or two examples and 2598 verbs (64.73 %) have been exemplified by 10 sentences or less.

At this point, we would like to highlight two aspects of SenSem in relation to both Ancora and ADESSE. First, we provide a minimum of 120 sentences per lemma and, therefore, the number of examples per sense is higher than in the resources seen so far: 55.21 % of the senses exemplified in the corpus for Spanish have more than 11 sentences and only 9.2 % of the senses have just one example; in Catalan, 33.69 % of the senses have more than 11 examples associated and only 6.81 % have one sentence. Second, even though the number of verbs described is smaller than in other resources, the description of constructions is unique as regards the number of linguistic phenomena covered with the annotation provided at the semantic level, as we will see in the next section. 2.2 Approaches to the study of argument structure In this section we are going to briefly review some approaches to the study and classification of argument structures and subcategorization patterns. One of the most important initiatives in this field, for its comprehensiveness, is the Grammar Pattern Project, 10 which derives from the English Cobuild. In Grammar Patterns they propose a hierarchy of subcategorization frames for English based on the examples extracted from the corpus used (Bank of English). It is a fine-grained classification of English structures and, therefore, language dependent since they include prepositions and other lexical items.

Within the English FrameNet project we can find the English Construction (Fillmore et al. 2012 ). 11 Following the principles of Construction Grammar they put forward a classification of English constructions that goes beyond the description of argument structure since they also account for phrasal and idiomatic constructions, like the Measurement_plus_adjective or Determiner_Noun_Phrase constructions. There have been similar initiatives in some FrameNets for other languages; this is the case of Swedish (Lyngfelt et al. 2012 ). In our proposal we do not account for idiomatic and phraseological constructions since we describe a more general level of word combination, clause level.

Other proposals organize this level of linguistic description hierarchically as is the case of Levin ( 1993 ). In SenSem, constructions defined at argument-structure level are also organized following a hierarchical structure. Like in Levin X  X  proposal, the higher levels of the classification are rather general. For example, the alternations described in Levin within the group Transitivity Alternations : Object of Transitive = Subject of Intransitive Alternations would correspond to the label  X  X  X etopicalized constructions X  X  in SenSem (see Sect. 4.2 ). Also, the alternations described in Levin within Alternations involving arguments within the VP would partially correspond to the constructions labeled as  X  X  X opicalized constructions X  X  in SenSem.
 Nevertheless, there is not a complete correspondence between SenSem and Levin X  X  classification. For example, in her proposal reciprocal alternations are classified within the group Alternations involving arguments within the VP whereas reflexive constructions are regarded an independent group of alternations. In Sensem, reflexive constructions are found as a type of topicalized constructions, whereas reciprocal constructions can be found in both, topicalized and detopicalized situations (see Sect. 4.2 ). Something similar happens with passive structures, which Levin considers independently, while we include them in the group of detopicalized constructions (see also Sect. 4.2 ). On the other hand, our classification remains more general than Levin X  X  since she incorporates in her classification language-related lexical and syntactic elements as is the case of alternations such as X X  X  Way construction or There -insertion . A major difference lies on the theoretical organization of information since we do not adopt the concept of alternation, but rather follow the framework of Construction Grammar (Goldberg 1995 ); each isolated configuration of the argument-structure level is understood and annotated as a pair of form and meaning. The methodology section is divided into two parts. Section 3.1 is devoted to briefly present the constitution of the corpus and in Sect. 3.2 we present the annotation process. 3.1 Corpus composition The Spanish and Catalan SenSem Corpora contain 30,368 and 25,067 annotated sentences respectively. 12 These sentences exemplify the use of 951 verb senses in Spanish and 1291 verb senses in Catalan. The difference in the number of sentences is due to the fact that the Spanish Corpus contains 5301 extra sentences from literary texts belonging to narrative works written in peninsular Spanish in the XXth and XXIst centuries. 13
The annotated clauses are presented contextualized in the sentence so, if we take into account all the words in the context (sentence) the total number of words in the Spanish Corpus is almost one million words (with a total of 455,905 annotated words). As regards the Catalan Corpus, it is made of 700,000 words (with a total of 391,267 annotated words). Even though the SSC can be considered medium-size in number, if we take into account that all the words have been annotated at several levels (lexical, syntagmatic, clausal and sentential semantics) then we must recognize its value for its comprehensive description of meaning. The SSC clauses have been tagged with linguistic information regarding several levels of linguistic analysis, including argument-structure. To see a description of other levels of annotation in SenSem (see Ferna  X  ndez-Montraveta and Va  X  zquez 2014 ). 14 The verb senses exemplified in SenSem can be grouped in about 250 lemmas. The list of lemmas to be included in the corpus was chosen according to their frequency. In order to determine the 250 most frequent verbs in Spanish, we created, automatically, a corpus with 13,000,000 words from the online edition of two of the most popular newspapers in Catalonia, La Vanguardia and El Peri X dico (Alonso et al. 2007 ).

The choice of the journalistic genre as the basis of our corpus was adopted basically for two main reasons. Firstly, the availability of online editions of the newspapers greatly facilitates the collection of data automatically. Secondly, informative journalistic texts are characterized by being varied in nature and include diverse discursive structures such as interviews, news, essays, etc. In the case of Spanish, by adding texts from the literary genre, even if they represent a mere 15 %, we have enhanced the value since it has helped us to exemplify new senses and constructions improving, therefore, the variety of linguistic phenomena collected. 3.2 Annotation process The annotation of the SenSem Corpora started in the year 2004. All along the process, we have had several annotators and two senior members, who established the guidelines for the annotators to follow, trained them and have guaranteed the quality and homogeneity of the process.

In order to ensure homogeneity in the annotation process, we carried out a study to measure inter-annotator agreement. Four members of the team annotated the same 59 sentences, randomly chosen. Once all the sentences had been annotated, we calculated inter-annotator agreement for every one of the levels that describe argument structure, i.e. the argumentality of the participants, the syntactic category and function of the phrases, the semantic labeling of arguments and the semantics of the clause.

First, we determined pair-wise proportions of overall agreement, that is, the ratio of cases in which two annotators agreed with respect to all cases. Also, we calculated the kappa coefficient (Cohen 1960 ), which was used as an indication of the stability and reproducibility of human judgments, taking into account the probabilities of agreement by chance. It must be noted that kappa values tend to be low in general due to the small size of the annotated corpus with which it was calculated and the small number of possible values, which makes chance agreement very probable.

In what follows we will present just a brief overview of some of the values. For a complete description of all of them and the kappa values (see Alonso et al. 2007 ). One of the most important issues is deciding if a participant is an argument or an adjunct. Sometimes this is a straightforward decision but this is not always the case. There seems to be a higher consensus when a participant is considered an argument (82 %), but deciding whether a participant is an adjunct seems to be a more difficult decision (64 %). Kappa values for argumentality in our study range between 0.46 and 0.54, indicating that results are good but reproducibility is not guaranteed.
The average agreement for syntactic categories also varies depending on the category being tagged. The categories most commonly agreed on are some types of subordinate clauses (completive clauses, infinitive clauses, direct speech) with a mean of over 90 % and a kappa above 0.9. The lowest agreement was reached with prepositional clauses with 72 %. All the other categories were placed somewhere between this 72 % and the 98 % of relative pronouns. Kappa values showed a wider range of values, from 0.16 for relative clauses to 1 for negative adverbials. Overall, kappa values for syntactic categories averaged above 0.7, showing good reproducibility for this level of annotation.

The agreement on syntactic functions ranged between 100 % for agentive complements and 66 % for prepositional complements, with lower kappa values for highly infrequent functions and higher values, above 0.7, for frequent ones, except direct object, which had a kappa of 0.63.

Finally, regarding the annotation of semantic roles, the higher agreement was reached for the labels of experiences (97 %) and cause (91 %) and the lowest the non-affected theme (70 %). The more fine-grained the distinctions we make at this level, the lower the agreement became. This could be seen when we subdivided theme into subtypes: non-affected theme, affected-theme, etc. Kappa values for semantic roles were high on average, closely following the figures for agreement.

Generally speaking, we could say that agreement was comparable to that reported in similar projects. For instance, Kingsbur et al. ( 2002 ) report an agreement ranging between 60 and 100 % for predicate-argument tagging within Propbank and in SenSem, all levels of annotation fall clearly within this 60 X 100 % range. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are respectively devoted to explain the formal and semantic aspects considered in this project to define constructions. We will use square brackets to mark the tags included in our annotation scheme (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ). 15 4.1 The form of constructions In order to define constructions formally, we take into account three criteria. First, as can be seen in Fig. 1 , the basic syntactic pattern is established by annotating phrasal categories and their syntactic function.

Second, taking into consideration the function of phrases in the clause, we differentiate two types of constructions depending on the presence/absence of a syntactic subject (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section A1). On the one hand, we have [impersonal constructions] (1), in which the elimination of the logical subject implies that there no longer is a grammatical subject in the sentence and, therefore, it cannot be retrieved. (1) a. Estamos de acuerdo en que arreglen la zona porque da vergu  X  enza co  X  mo
On the other hand, we find sentences in which the subject function can be identified ([non-impersonal constructions]). 19 This is the case of (2a), where a prototypical active sentence is represented. Sometimes, as in (2b), the subject function is not instantiated to a physical constituent because, as it is known, Spanish and Catalan are pro-drop languages, and in these cases the syntactic subject is covert. Finally, in this second group, passive or anticausative constructions, where the logical object acts as the grammatical subject (in contrast to (1b)), are also included (2c). (2) a. El Gobierno vasco elabor X  un plan para erradicar el problema.
Third, constructions are classified into three groups depending on the verb form (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section A2). Thus, in some clauses the verb keeps its form (1a), in others, a [pronominal verb form] 20 is added (1b) and, finally, there are also cases where it takes a [periphrastic verb form]. 21 For example, sentences such as (1c) or (3) are different from the point of view of impersonality, but both coincide in the kind of verb form they take (periphrastic verb group). In (1c), the auxiliary hay ( haber  X  X o have to/need X ) followed by a conjunction que ( X  X hat X ) and the infinitive form of the verb is used to express impersonal obligation. In (3), the verb fue ( ser  X  X o be X ) followed by the participle form of the verb is used to build a passive construction (see Sect. 3.2 ). (3) La v X   X  ctima fue alcanzada en un brazo, el abdomen, el glu  X  teo y una pierna.
In summary, both [impersonal] and [non-impersonal constructions] can be expressed by means of a [pronominal verb form] or a [non-pronominal verb form], either a [lexical verb form] or a [periphrastical verb form]. 4.2 The meaning of constructions In order to define the semantics of constructions, we differentiate three levels of specificity. The first level allows us to classify constructions into two big groups taking into account factors related to discourse structure (Sect. 4.2.1 ). The second level permits us to further specify these two main groups by considering the semantic role of the logical subject (Sect. 4.2.2 ). And finally, at the third level, we present those constructions that are of a specific nature; some of them are only possible in one of the two main groups (Sect. 4.2.3 ). 4.2.1 Topicalization versus detopicalization In this level, we distinguish between those constructions in which the logical and grammatical subjects coincide (1) from those in which they do not (2). This allows us to differentiate between sentences in which the logical subject has been [topicalized] 22 versus those in which it is [detopicalized] (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BI). This meaning contrast is basic for many languages, including Spanish, Catalan and English. It allows the user to decide the topic, the element about which he/she is talking: if the speaker decides to provide information about the  X  X  X oer X  X  of an action, the doer will be in the position of syntactic subject; but if the speaker wants to talk about something/someone that  X  X  X eceived X  X  the action, the  X  X  X oer X  X  can be either expressed as an adjunct or be completely left aside.

Finally, in order to relate the form (dealt with in Sect. 3.1 ) and the meaning of constructions, it should be added that the cases of [impersonal constructions] are always cases of [detopicalized] clauses, since in impersonal constructions there is never a syntactic subject. On the other hand, [non-impersonal constructions] can be either [topicalized] or [detopicalized]. 4.2.2 Subspecification according to semantic role labeling In the annotation of clause constituents, the first step is deciding which phrases are arguments and which are adjuncts. Secondly, we annotate all arguments with a semantic tag that identifies the semantic functions (semantic roles) of arguments. Below (Fig. 2 ) we present again Fig. 1 but this time it has been completed with this information. 23
We further classify constructions according to the semantic role the logical subject has in the case of topicalized constructions (or would have in the case of detopicalized) according to the information provided in the lexicon (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BII).
Traditionally, topicalized sentences are considered active sentences and are usually tagged as agentive or causative, and, therefore, they should include an agent or a cause, respectively, in subject position. However, verbs such as querer ( X  X ove X ) (4), tener ( X  X ave X ) (5) or encontrar ( X  X ind X ) (6) cannot be associated with either an agentive or causative interpretation: in the first case (4), the verb describes a mental process, in the second (5) a state and in (6) an event in which the subject is not agentive (control and/or intention over the action is irrelevant for it to happen). In SenSem we would use the tag topicalized to describe these constructions and then further classify them according to the kind of semantic relation performed by the subject, namely experiencer (4), theme (5) and initiator (6). (4) Jacinta nunca le dijo a Pene  X  lope que la quer X a . (5) La residencia tiene 78 plazas en habitaciones habitualmente ocupadas por (6) Al llegar a la puerta del cuarto de la sen  X  ora, en el suelo al lado de la puerta,
As regards detopicalized constructions, the problem is similar since there is not a general term to name them. Thus, we only have available terminology to designate the cases of detopicalization of agents, exemplified in (7), or causes, represented in (8): (7) Se ha anunciado el propo  X  sito de entablar un amplio dia  X  logo pol X   X  tico con los
The first type (detopicalization of agents) is labeled with the term passive , but, in practice, detopicalization of experiencers (9) or initiators (10) is also considered a passive construction, which is not consistent with the definition of the term passive . (9) &gt; Y que  X  se pretende con el acto de man  X  ana? (10) No so  X  lo se pierde dinero, tambie  X  n se pierde el tiempo.

In the Spanish and Catalan literature, different tags are used to refer to detopicalization of causes (8). One of them is pronominal construction , which presents a twofold problem: first, it is a formal tag and, therefore, does not account for the semantics of the sentence and, second, it is ambiguous since most passive structures are also pronominal. Another common term used to refer to detopical-ization of causes in Spanish is construcci X n media ( middle construction ). The use of the adjective  X  X  X edia X  X  ( middle ) also creates a terminological problem in Spanish since middle is also used, following the English tradition, to refer to another kind of construction (see Section 4.3). 4.2.3 Specific constructions At this level we have defined five constructions according to the following semantic information: aspectuality (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BIIIa); coindexation of arguments (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BIIIb); and information provided by specific adjuncts (see  X  X  X ppendix 1  X  X ; section BIIIc). 4.2.3.1 Aspectuality We identified three kinds of constructions: middle construc-tion, telic construction and habitual construction. The [middle construction] (11) has been largely studied in the literature both in English (Keyser and Roeper 1984 ; Hale and Keyser 1986 ) and in Spanish (Gra ` cia 1989 ; Cifuentes 1999 ). It denotes a stative sentence describing a property of an object. In our proposal it is part of the group considered within the family of detopicalized constructions. In Spanish it usually requires a pronominal construction. Nevertheless, we have established that the frequency of this construction in the corpus is extremely rare (see Sect. 5 ). (11) Bab Boujloud es una puerta monumental que se abre sobre una inmensa
With the tag [habitual construction] (12) we describe a situation that happens with repeated frequency and, therefore, the verb in the clause does not really refer to any particular event or series of events (Comrie 1976 ). Habitual meaning can be conveyed by topicalized or detopicalized constructions and the verbal form can be pronominal or not, depending on the verb. (12) A los que nos gusta la montan  X  a, a menudo nos acercamos a las zonas del
Regarding the construction we called [telic construction] (13), we use this label to describe pronominal structures in which the role of the pronoun is to bind the event denoted by the verb (Sanz 1995 24 ). This interpretation is only possible as a topicalized construction. (13) Esto le lleva, mientras se come una naranja, a hacer una reflexio  X  n sobre los 4.2.3.2 Coindexation We take into account the coindexation of participants 25 in order to annotate [reflexive] (14) and [reciprocal constructions] (15). (14) En aquel instante se consideraba superior a todos los hombres. (15) Armstrong y Crow se conocieron el oton  X  o pasado en Las Vegas.
Reciprocal constructions can be pronominal or non-pronominal. Symmetric verbs do not require a pronominal construction unless they are lexically pronominal ( encontrarse  X  X o meet X ). Also, symmetric verbs can be found in both topicalized and detopicalizad constructions. Non-symmetric verbs will always require a pronominal construction to express reciprocity and are only found in topicalized constructions. 26 4.2.3.3 The presence of specific adjuncts In Spanish it is possible the use of an extra pronoun, a dative, which adds the construction another participant acting as benefactor, a person with whom a favorable or unfavorable relationship is established, as in (16). This kind of construction is known as [dative construction] and can be used both in topicalized or detopicalized sentences, as in (16). 27 (16) ( ... ) el carnet joven hace an  X  os que no me lo renuevan .
 In this section we are going to present some information about frequency regarding formal and semantic aspects of the constructions. The data presented in this work should be interpreted as tendencies of the language, especially valid for the journalistic domain and, to a lesser extent for the literary register. If we considered other types of registers, such as the conversational register, the data could possibly vary.

In Table 1 , we can see that topicalized constructions are the most common group in the Spanish and Catalan SSC. 28 As can be observed, the general tendency is for the number of detopicalized sentences to be significantly smaller in SSC: almost the 90 % of sentences correspond to topicalization and slightly over 10 % to detopicalization in both languages. Within the set of topicalized constructions, the most relevant group is the one formed by agentive topicalized constructions, followed by stative constructions, whose subject has been labeled as theme. Within the set of detopicalized constructions, the most common case is the one in which an agent is detopicalized, followed by detopicalized causative constructions. 29 As for constructions with an elided subject, the figure is not trivial, since it represents a little more than 25.00 % of the sentences in the corpus.

As concerns the differences between registers, we would like to highlight three aspects from the data reflected in Table 1 . First, in the journalistic register, the tendency to use detopicalization constructions is higher than in the literary register, possibly because in literary texts more personal experiences are narrated. Second, the elision of the subject is more common in the literary register, probably because precision is one of the characteristics of the journalistic register. Finally, as can be seen, the results are quite similar in both languages.

In Table 2 the frequency of other constructions reviewed in Sect. 4.2 is displayed (except for the middle construction since it has only been identified twice in the whole corpus). As can be observed, the most frequent construction is the one we have called habitual construction. We can see that the other 4 constructions (telic, reflexive, reciprocal and dative) represent a really small percentage of sentences in Spanish and Catalan SSC since neither group reaches higher representability than 1%. 30 So, we can consider their use in Spanish/Catalan rather marginal.
Given the figures presented in Table 2 we believe that there are not really significant differences in both languages with the exception of the Dative Construction. We can also note a difference in the frequency of use of this construction in Spanish depending on the register. As can be seen it is approximately four times more common in the literary register. This could be due to the fact that we can find dialogues and more informal writing in books than in newspapers and, thus, subjectivity, expressed by the presence of the dative, is also more present in the former.

Next, we present some data regarding subcategorization frames taking into account their semantics (Table 3 ). As can be seen, we have identified 69 syntactic frames in Spanish and 65 in Catalan. If we consider only formal aspects, only around 25 % of the frames in Spanish and 20 % in Catalan are common to both topicalized and detopicalized constructions. Also, we would like to point out that the variability of possible frames expressing detopicalized constructions is higher even though the number of sentences in the corpus is clearly much lower.
In Table 4 , we present the five most frequent frames in the corpus regardless semantics. As can be observed, the frames are the same for both languages and the figures quite similar. The first frame, which is the prototypical transitive frame, represents almost half the sentences and doubles in frequency the second most common frame.

If we associate semantics to these frames, we see that three of them (2, 3 and 5) are present in both main construction families and the other two (1 and 4) are exclusive of topicalized constructions. Altogether these five frames represent 89.33 % of the Spanish frames and of the total 90.23 % of frames for Catalan.
Below we present Tables 5 and 6 with the percentages for the most frequent frames in both families of constructions, topicalized or detopicalized. As can be seen we present two different percentages; the former represents the percentage of the frame in all the corpus and the latter the percentage of the frame within each family.
In Table 5 , we can see the 9 most frequent frames expressing topicalized constructions from the 39 (35 for Catalan) frames associated with this semantic tag. Again, no remarkable differences between both languages are observed. The first four most frequent frames of this type coincide with the four first most frequent in the corpus (see Table 4 ). The first configuration, a typical transitive structure, represents 48.46 % (51.63 % for Catalan) of all cases while the other next three frames represent a total of 45.05 % (43.01 % for Catalan). The next five most frequent frames present raw frequencies ranging from 100 to 500 sentences and they just suppose a mere 4.87 % (3.57 % for Catalan). The remaining frames (not represented in Table 5 ) correspond to less than 2 % of all the topicalized constructions.

There are 46 frames (45 for Catalan) associated with constructions expressing detopicalization. The six most frequent frames are described in Table 6 . The purely intransitive pronominal frame is by far the most common in both languages (52.87 and 53.74 %), followed by a pronominal pattern with a PP as complement (19.76 and 19.63 %). Then, frequency abruptly descends in the next 4 frames presented. We can add that we have identified 40 (39 for Catalan) frames with less than 100 sentences. They represent only 15.90 % of the sentences in the family of detopicalized constructions (13.68 % for Catalan).
 The first three most frequent frames in Table 6 are pronominal, as is the fifth. This fact proves that pronominal constructions are the most common structure to express detopicalization in Spanish and Catalan (pronominal constructions represent a 70 % of the total of possible frames expressing detopicalization). We need to add that pronominal passives are more common than syntactic passives in Spanish. Probably this is one of the facts that contribute to the high frequency of pronominal constructions. Note that in the Spanish SSC syntactic passives represent 0.22 % (0.27 % in Catalan). In the literary register we have not found any syntactic passive construction at all. 31 In addition, anticausative constructions also require mostly a pronominal structure in this language.

If we compare Spanish and Catalan as regards the information shown in Table 6 we observe that, in general, the results are again quite similar. Nevertheless, it X  X  worth mentioning the slightly lower frequency of the pronominal pattern 3 in Catalan, which is the only impersonal pattern on the table. 32 The reason is that in Spanish the preposition a  X  X o X  is required to introduce direct objects that designate a person. This kind of complement will never become the subject of a pronominal construction of destopicalization (17a) since it is a PP. This requirement does not exist in Catalan so this argument, expressed as a regular NP, becomes the subject in the pronominal passive construction (17b). 33 The consequence is that patterns 1 and 4 (which are personal) have a slightly higher frequency in Catalan. (17) a. En ese caso se contratar X   X  a a novecientos cincuenta mil trabajadores,  X  X n this case, nine thousand five hundred workers would be hired because this is the number of micro-businesses in Spain X .
 More data about pronominal detopicalized constructions are presented in Table 7 . As can be seen, pronominalization is much more common in non-impersonal (93.90 % in Spanish and 92.93 % in Catalan) constructions, such as (2c), than in impersonal (36.88 % in Spanish and 48.42 % in Catalan), as in example (1b). As can be seen, the latter are slightly more frequent in Catalan than in Spanish. This is so because the form of the periphrasis is different in both languages. In Spanish we express obligation using a non-pronominal impersonal verb ( haber que  X  X ave to X ) whereas in Catalan the verb used to express obligation is lexically pronominal ( haver -se de ).

In relation to Table 7 , we also would like to highlight the low frequency of impersonal constructions: 17.34 % (14.06 % in Catalan) in relation to detopicalized constructions and 2.07 % (1.77 % in Catalan) considering the whole corpus. 34 In this article we have presented the annotation scheme for constructions at the argument-structure level used in SSC, which include both a Spanish and a Catalan corpus.
Our main contribution is that we have expanded the traditional annotation of argument structure, i.e. the semantic and syntactic tagging of constituents, by providing information about the meaning of the construction. Thus, SSC constitute a remarkable resource in that they incorporate information about high-level semantics.
If compared to similar resources for other languages, such as English, there are not any other corpora that include a semantic interpretation at the argument-structure level, except for FrameNet. In the case of other Spanish corpora, the other project that annotates this kind of information is BDS-ADESSE but it is not as consistent and comprehensive as SSC. As for Catalan, the SenSem corpus is the only corpus that includes semantic information at the clause level beyond the semantic roles. Furthermore, some of the constructions presented in this paper, such as reciprocal or dative constructions, have been annotated in the Spanish and Catalan corpora for the first time.

At the top level of our hierarchy of constructions at the argument-structure level, the main criterion we have used is the coincidence of the logical subject and the syntactic one. This criterion allows us to group all the sentences in two big categories: according to the topicalization or detopicalization of the logical subject. We would like to point out that we believe that the organization we propose is not necessarily language specific and we think it could be applied to other languages besides Catalan and Spanish, such as English or French.

As regards the results presented, first we would like to highlight some data related to subcategorization frames for both corpus: (1) within the group of topicalized sentences, which is clearly the most frequent construction in the corpus, just two frames represent around 70 % ( NPVNP and NPVPP ); (2) these two frames are represent 65 % of all the sentences in the corpora; (3) detopicalized constructions represent just around 11 % (12.60 % in Catalan) of the total number of sentences; (4) within detopicalized constructions, we also find two pronominal frames ( NP PRON V and NP PRON V PP ) that are approximately 70 % of the examples annotated. Second, there are some interesting differences when comparing journalistic and literary registers in Spanish, e.g. in the case of the elision of the subject, which is much more common in the latter case. Third, some specific constructions, within the topicalization or detopicalization group, such as the telic, the reflexive, the reciprocal or the dative constructions, are extremely marginal in common language use. As has been shown by the analysis of the data, the results in Spanish and Catalan are quite similar.
