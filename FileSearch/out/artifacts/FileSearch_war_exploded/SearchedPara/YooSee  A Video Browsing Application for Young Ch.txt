Nowadays children as young as two years old can eas-ily interact with mobile touch screen devices and personal computers to watch online videos through services such as YouTube. However, such services present a number of chal-lenges for young children (e.g. fine grain gestures/interactions and good typing/literacy skills). In addition, when children use such services there is a risk that they may stumble upon content that is inappropriate. YooSee 1 is a web-based ap-plication developed using the PuppyIR framework [1] and designed for children aged between two and six years old. YooSee enables children to: (1) search and browse through video content using an engaging, novel interaction paradigm, and (2) be able to safely enjoy moderated video content.
The application was motivated by a desire to address the issues that children have with text based searching. In [2], Druin et al show that children face a number of problems associated with formulating queries, such as: spelling, se-lecting the right words, and the use -or not -of natural language. Additionally, in [3], it was found that children prefer to browse through content. YooSee avoids the prob-lems associated with querying by providing a novel interac-tion paradigm based around a globe of videos for children to explore. Conceptually the globe can be thought of as a series of carousels containing videos: where the interaction paradigm allows two forms of browsing/scrolling: 1. in carousel to access similar and related content, and, 2. between carousels to access different content. Providing content around a globe allows the child to have seamless and continuous interaction with the content pro-vided i.e. as they with move around the carousels, or move between carousels, they will eventually loop around the globe.
YooSee also adopts a minimilist interface in response to concerns raised in [2] about the information overload expe-rienced by children. Consequently, only a small part of the content space is presented at once as shown in Figure 1,
