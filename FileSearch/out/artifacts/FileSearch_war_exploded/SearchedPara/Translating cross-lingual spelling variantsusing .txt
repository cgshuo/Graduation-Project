 1.Introduction
Technical terms and proper names are often central keys in requests for information. In dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) they constitute a major problem, since they are not found in general translation dictionaries, except for the most commonly used terms and names. In dic-source language forms. Unless they are identical to the corresponding database index terms, they do not each other, as German konstruktion and English construction . This allows the use of fuzzy matching (approximate string matching) techniques to find the target language correspondents of source language keys.

Approximate matching techniques involve Soundex and Phonix, which compare words on the basis of between the strings is computed on the basis of the number of similar n -grams and the total number of unique n -grams in the strings.
 The technique bears some resemblance to query translation and transliteration reported in Fujii and
Ishikawa (2001). Fujii and Ishikawa use character-based rules to establish mapping between English characters and romanized Japanese katakana characters. They also utilize probabilistic character-based focus from ours.

In the first step of our technique, source language words are transformed into intermediate forms by forms to their target language equivalents than the original source language words. We call this step transformation rule based translation (TRT). A transformation rule refers to an automatically extracted regular correspondence between the characters in two languages, for instance Spanish character string ia corresponds to English character y , e.g., in the term pair somatologia X  X omatology . their target language equivalents through fuzzy matching. The benefits of the combined technique are in language equivalents. This allows n -gram matching to rank the correct equivalents high.
The transformation rules were generated automatically by extracting equivalent term pairs from a target language and Finnish, French, German, Spanish, and Swedish source languages. different domains. The intermediate forms obtained using TRT were matched through n -gram matching been retrieved. We will demonstrate that the combined fuzzy translation technique performs better, sometimes considerably better, than n -grams alone.

In Pirkola, Toivonen, Keskustalo, Visala, and J  X  arvelin (2003) we presented first results on the fuzzy how effective TRT is as such when used alone without fuzzy matching. This is an important question when
TRT applications are considered. We evaluated the effectiveness of TRT by considering what proportion of word forms obtained through TRT are correct translations (translation precision) and what proportion of source words are translated correctly (translation recall).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology and data, and Section 3 the findings. Section 4 contains the discussion and conclusions. 2.Methodsanddata 2.1. Automatic generation of rules
This section describes the automatic rule generation process. Fig. 1 illustrates the process by means of examples. The process consisted of the following main steps:  X  Extracting similar terms from a dictionary.  X  Selection of transformations.  X  Generation of transformation rules. 2.1.1. Extracting similar terms
The source and target language term pairs that were sufficiently similar were identified, and were ex-tracted from a dictionary for further processing. The similarity was determined using edit distance (ED, the minimum cost needed to convert one string into another. Conversion includes the operations of
The equation thus gives the minimum sum of the number of operations needed to convert string A into string B .

Transformation rules were produced for the following language pairs:  X  Finnish X  X nglish,  X  French X  X nglish,  X  German X  X nglish,  X  Spanish X  X nglish,  X  Swedish X  X nglish.

German X  X nglish, French X  X nglish, and Spanish X  X nglish term pairs were extracted from the multilingual medical dictionary provided by Andr e Fairchild. The number of dictionary entries varied between 11,000 and 12,000 depending on the language pair. Finnish X  X nglish and Swedish X  X nglish term pairs were by Kielikone Plc. The Finnish list contained 5970 terms. The Swedish list was small containing just 657 terms. 2.1.2. Selection of transformations
In the next step, all the transformations that produced the minimum ED were searched for each term pair using a recursive algorithm. The algorithm was based on the AllAlignment algorithm described in Charras and Lecroq (1998). From the result set of all transformations, one transformation was selected.
The selection was done using the smallest sum of error values. The error values for the transformations were calculated as follows (Covington, 1996):  X  0, terms share the same character at the same position,  X  1, consonant X  X onsonant substitution, and vowel X  X owel substitution,  X  1, insertion or deletion of a character,  X  2, consonant X  X owel substitution, and vowel X  X onsonant substitution.

 divided by the number of source words where the source string of the rule occurs. All these, context information, frequency, and confidence factor are utilized when the automatically generated rules are applied. 2.2. Sample rules
Table 1 shows sample German-to-English rules, sorted on the basis of the frequency of the rules. The middle of words, with the confidence factor being 89.25% (100% 191/214). 2.3. Testing the effectiveness of two-step fuzzy translation
For each source language, terms in the following five domains were used as test words:  X  Place names, n  X  55.  X  Terms in economics, n  X  31.  X  Terms in technology, n  X  36.  X  Miscellaneous terms, n  X  59.
 The bio terms and place names were gathered by browsing the target word list from the start to the end.
A set of English terms was selected as test words and was translated into the five source languages by a research assistant. The translations were checked by native speakers or advanced students of the source languages. The terms in economics, technology and the miscellaneous terms were selected from the dic-words were available for the tests.

As we tested five source languages the total number of test words used in the experiments was 5 (90 + 55 + 31 + 36 + 59)  X  1355 words. In addition, for determining confidence factor and frequency thresholds, we used a separate Spanish training data.

The source words were translated by means of TRT to obtain the intermediate forms (Section 2.3.1). The intermediate forms were then matched using n -gram matching against the words of the target word list 189,000 words. Similarity between the intermediate forms and the words in the target word list was computed to obtain a ranked list of target words.

As baselines we used digrams and trigrams, i.e., n -grams containing two and three characters respec-tively. For baselines similarity was computed between the source words and the words in the target word list. 2.3.1. Translating source words through TRT
Two TRT translation strategies were examined in combination with n -gram matching. The first one is strategy seeks to minimize the number of incorrect transformations. Based on the training results a con-fidence factor of 50% was used as a threshold. For each source word one intermediate form was produced associated with HCF is that the number of rules that are available is limited.

In HCF the rules were applied to source words in the following reading order: (1) the location of the was applied to a word. As TRT is a new method we did not have prior knowledge which order might give the most accurate intermediate forms. The application order of the rules has effects in the case of competitive rules which, however, were not common. However, the optimization of the application order is a question that needs further investigation.

The second strategy is called a low confidence factor (LCF) strategy . For each source word all the possible intermediate forms were produced by applying to a source word all the rules applicable to it. and convection . In LCF the application order of the rules is irrelevant, as each order yields the same intermediate forms. Each intermediate form of the source word gave one result list. These were combined on the basis of the scores of each match to yield one ranked result list.

The rationale behind LCF is that it is likely that the set of intermediate forms obtained through TRT word was included in the set of intermediate forms). A drawback associated with LCF is that it may give many incorrect transformations.

Both in HCF and LCF the (bad) rules whose frequency was less than 50 were removed. 2.3.2. n -Gram matching In n -gram matching words are decomposed into n -grams, i.e., into substrings of length n (Keskustalo, reported to be an effective technique among various approximate matching techniques in name searching 2003) and is an appropriate fuzzy matching technique for use with TRT.

In this study, digrams and trigrams were used as baselines, and in combination with TRT. Both in digrams and trigrams the start and end white spaces were used as constituent characters of n -grams.
The degree of similarity between the source words (intermediate forms) and target words, w computed on the basis of the number of n -grams that the words have in common and the total number of unique n -grams in the words, as follows (Pfeifer et al., 1996): where N i refers to the set of n -grams derived from the word w
For each test word precision was calculated. In this context precision is defined as the proportion of matching. Finally, average precision over all test words was computed. Sometimes two or more words share the same SIM-value. Therefore two variants of precision were computed: in the first one, the correct equivalent was assumed to be the last word among the words with equal SIM-value; in the second one, the correct equivalent was assumed to be in the middle of the set of the words with equal SIM-value. Due to the small number of matching words having the same SIM-value the two variant measures of precision gave almost the same results. We therefore show average position precision results only in Tables 2 X 9 in
Section 3. 2.4. Testing the effectiveness of TRT proportion of correct equivalents among all word forms yielded by TRT. Both translation recall and precision were computed at four confidence factor (CF) and frequency (Fr.) levels. The following combi-nations were tested:  X  CF  X  50%, Fr.  X  50  X  CF  X  10%, Fr.  X  50  X  CF  X  10%, Fr.  X  10  X  CF  X  2.0%, Fr.  X  4 In this test the test words were the same as in the fuzzy translation test (Section 2.3). 3.Findings 3.1. Two-step fuzzy translation
For Swedish, transformation rules were produced by using only 657 term pairs. The combined TRT and fuzzy matching technique was not useful, but it performed as well or slightly worse than fuzzy matching alone. The Swedish results suggest that the rules should be formed on the basis of thousands rather than hundreds of term pairs.

The results of fuzzy translation tests are presented in Tables 2 X  5(HCF strategy) and Tables 6 X 9 (LCF strategy). There are several clear trends in Tables 2 X 9:  X  The combined TRT and fuzzy matching technique performs well, but its effectiveness depends on the source language. For Finnish performance improvements are considerable (Tables 2 and 6). For German and Spanish performance improvements are smaller but the combined technique performs clearly better than digrams and trigrams alone. For French precision is changed only slightly (Tables 3 and 7). In most cases it is improved but sometimes slightly decreased.  X  LCF yields better results than HCF in particular for French and Spanish. However, no major differences are found between the effectiveness of the strategies.  X  In HCF, TRT with digrams performs better than TRT with trigrams in most cases. In LCF, TRT with trigrams performs roughly as well as TRT with digrams. medical terms). In fact, the best improvements are achieved in the domain of technology. However, using several specific dictionaries might add rules and improve the results.

In part, the results can be explained on the basis of the number of identical terms shared by a source follows: Finnish (0.0%), French (48.8%), German (21.7%), and Spanish (11.1%). Thus, French and English issue needs further investigation. 3.2. TRT effectiveness
Tables 10 X 13 report translation recall and precision results by term domain. The number of rules (NoR) and frequency are decreased. For French, German and Spanish at CF  X  2.0% and Fr.  X  4 recall is between 77.8% and 97.8% in the domains of bio terms and technology. For Finnish the percentages are generally word forms yielded by TRT). On the other hand, the automatic rule generation process was not able to capture some important Finnish-to-English rules (some vowel deletion rules) for reasons which have to be analyzed. This may in part explain lower recall for Finnish.
 We analyzed the transformation errors in Finnish-to-English and French-to-English TRT in the case of
In the error type 3, transformation occurs frequently in a language pair but our method was not able to capture the rule. An example of such a case is the word pair koodi ! code , where a common deletion of a vowel occurs when translating from Finnish to English. Probably, this rule was not found in our rule collection due to a relatively small number of Finnish-English word pairs available for rule generation.
As shown in Table 14, the most common error types are 1 and 3. It might be possible to address them by promising method to improve TRT effectiveness. It could give correct translations in cases where direct rules are not available for source and target words.

As shown in Tables 10 X 13, TRT translates most terms correctly at low confidence factor and frequency percentages are 97.8% and 12.8% (88/685), respectively. These numbers suggest that TRT as such without fuzzy matching is insufficient in machine translation, in CLIR, or other applications, and must be sup-plemented with a disambiguation method capable of filtering out the incorrect word forms. In the domain of place names recall is generally lower than in the other domains for all test languages. Cross-lingual variation in geographical names cannot be captured by means of transformation rules to the same extent as variation in technical terms, since cross-lingual geographical names have often diverged much from their original forms. 4.Discussionandconclusions
Technical terms and proper names often are untranslatable due to limited coverage of translation dic-queries. In this study we presented a novel fuzzy translation technique based on automatically generated transformation rules and fuzzy matching. Two translation strategies were tested. In the high confidence source word often yielding several intermediate forms. Digram and trigram matching were tested in combination with TRT. The results were encouraging as both strategies and combination methods per-formed better than digrams and trigrams alone. The results also showed that the effectiveness of HCF and LCF translation strategies, as well as digrams and trigrams, depends on a source language.
Digrams and trigrams alone often failed to give precise translations for terms which differed in more list, whereas in the combined TRT and digram list it was at the first position, since TRT gave a correct list of Fin-Eng/TRT and digram matching (avg. precision 72.0%, Table 2). The distribution statistics is typical of all cases of this level precision.

As shown, 80% of the correct equivalents are within the set of four highest ranked words. Manual list. The distribution figures above suggest that the TRT based fuzzy translation technique is viable in ways to improve this novel technique (see below).

In the second test we investigated how effective TRT is as such. Recall improvements were remarkable
TRT may be applied without fuzzy matching. However, at low confidence factor and frequency levels precision was low. In most applications precision close to 100% is required. Therefore an effective dis-the source words translated by means of TRT. One possible disambiguation method might be the use of word collocation statistics.

Our future research also involves the identification of language pairs for which fuzzy translation is specific language pair, selecting the best TRT and fuzzy matching combination, and testing how to apply fuzzy translation in actual CLIR research. Regarding the best combination we will explore other fuzzy matching techniques than those tested in this study together with TRT. One promising method is LCS (longest common subsequence) and another skipgrams described in Keskustalo et al. (2003) and Pirkola et al. (2002). The actual CLIR research seeks to answer the question how fuzzy translation should be performance.
