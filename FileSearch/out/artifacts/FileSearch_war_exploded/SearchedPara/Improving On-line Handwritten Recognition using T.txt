 Although current state-of-the-art machine transla-tion (MT) systems have improved greatly in the last ten years, they are not able to provide the high qual-ity results that are needed for industrial and busi-ness purposes. For that reason, a new interactive paradigm has emerged recently. In interactive ma-chine translation (IMT) (Foster et al., 1998; Bar-rachina et al., 2009; Koehn and Haddow, 2009) the system goal is not to produce  X  X erfect X  translations in a completely automatic way, but to help the user build the translation with the least effort possible.
A typical approach to IMT is shown in Fig. 1. A source sentence f is given to the IMT system. First, the system outputs a translation hypothesis  X  e s in the target language, which would correspond to the out-put of fully automated MT system. Next, the user analyses the source sentence and the decoded hy-pothesis, and validates the longest error-free prefix e p finding the first error. The user, then, corrects the erroneous word by typing some keystrokes  X  , and sends them along with e p to the system, as a new val-idated prefix e p , X  . With that information, the sys-tem is able to produce a new, hopefully improved, suffix  X  e s that continues the previous validated pre-fix. This process is repeated until the user agrees with the quality of the resulting translation.
The usual way in which the user introduces the corrections  X  is by means of the keyboard. How-ever, other interaction modalities are also possible. For example, the use of speech interaction was stud-ied in (Vidal et al., 2006). In that work, several sce-narios were proposed, where the user was expected to speak aloud parts of the current hypothesis and possibly one or more corrections. On-line HTR for interactive systems was first explored for interactive transcription of text images (Toselli et al., 2010). Later, we proposed an adaptation to IMT in (Alabau et al., 2010). For both cases, the decoding of the on-line handwritten text is performed independently as a previous step of the suffix e s decoding. To our knowledge, (Alabau et al., 2010) has been the first and sole approach to the use of on-line handwriting in IMT so far. However, that work did not exploit the specific particularities of the MT scenario.
The novelties of this paper with respect to previ-ous work are summarised in the following items:  X  in previous formalisations of the problem, the  X  the use of specific language modelling for on- X  additionally, a thorough study of the errors
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-lows: The statistical framework for multimodal IMT and their alternatives will be studied in Sec. 2. Sec-tion 3 is devoted to the evaluation of the proposed models. Here, the results will be analysed and com-pared to previous approaches. Finally, conclusions and future work will be discussed in Sec. 4. In the traditional IMT scenario, the user interacts with the system through a series of corrections intro-duced with the keyboard. This iterative nature of the process is emphasised by the loop in Fig. 1, which indicates that, for a source sentence to be translated, several interactions between the user and the system should be performed. In each interaction, the system produces the most probable suffix  X  e s that completes the prefix formed by concatenating the longest cor-rect prefix from the previous hypothesis e p and the keyboard correction  X  . In addition, the concatena-tion of them, ( e p , X ,  X  e s ), must be a translation of f . Statistically, this problem can be formulated as
The multimodal IMT approach differs from Eq. 1 in that the user introduces the correction using a touch-screen or an electronic pen, t . Then, Eq. 1 can be rewritten as
As t is a non-deterministic input (contrarily to  X  ), t needs to be decoded in a word d of the vocabu-lary. Thus, we must marginalise for every possible decoding:
Furthermore, by applying simple Bayes transfor-mations and making reasonable assumptions,
The first term in Eq. 4 is a morphological model and it can be approximated with hidden Markov models (HMM). The last term is an IMT model as described in (Barrachina et al., 2009). Finally, Pr ( d | e p , f ) is a constrained language model. Note that the language model is conditioned to the longest correct prefix, just as a regular language model. Be-sides, it is also conditioned to the source sentence, since d should result of the translation of it.
A typical session of the multimodal IMT is ex-emplified in Fig. 2. First, the system starts with an empty prefix, so it proposes a full hypothesis. The output would be the same of a fully automated system. Then, the user corrects the first error, not , by writing on a touch-screen. The HTR subsys-tem mistakenly recognises in . Consequently, the user falls back to the keyboard and types is . Next, the system proposes a new suffix, in which the first word, not , has been automatically corrected. The user amends at by writing the word , which is cor-rectly recognised by the HTR subsystem. Finally, as the new proposed suffix is correct, the process ends. 2.1 Decoupled Approach In (Alabau et al., 2010) we proposed a decoupled approach to Eq. 4, where the on-line HTR decod-ing was a separate problem from the IMT problem. From Eq. 4 a two step process can be performed. First,  X  d is obtained,
Then, the most likely suffix is obtained as in Eq 1, but taking  X  d as the corrected word instead of  X  ,
Finally, in that work, the terms of Eq. 5 were in-terpolated with a unigram in a log-linear model. 2.2 Coupled Approach The formulation presented in Eq. 4 can be tackled directly to perform a coupled decoding. The prob-lem resides in how to model the constrained lan-guage model. A first approach is to drop either the e p or f terms from the probability. If f is dropped, then Pr ( d | e p ) can be modelled as a regular n -gram model. On the other hand, if e p is dropped, but the position of d in the target sentence i = | e p | + 1 is kept, Pr ( d | f ,i ) can be modelled as a word-based translation model. Let us introduce a hidden vari-able j that accounts for a position of a word in f which is a candidate translation of d . Then,
Both probabilities, Pr ( j | f ,i ) and Pr ( d | f j ) , can be estimated using IBM models (Brown et al., 1993). The first term is an alignment probability while the second is a word dictionary. Word dic-tionary probabilities can be directly estimated by IBM1 models. However, word dictionaries are not symmetric. Alternatively, this probability can be estimated using the inverse dictionary to provide a smoothed dictionary,
Thus, four word-based translation models have been considered: direct IBM1 and IBM2 models, and inverse IBM1-inv and IBM2-inv models with the inverse dictionary from Eq. 9.

However, a more interesting set up than using lan-guage models or translation models alone is to com-bine both models. Two schemes have been studied. The most formal under a probabilistic point of view is a linear interpolation of the models,
Pr ( d | e p , f ) =  X Pr ( d | e p ) + (1  X   X  ) Pr ( d | f ,i )
However, a common approach to combine models nowadays is log-linear interpolation (Berger et al., 1996; Papineni et al., 1998; Och and Ney, 2002),
Pr ( d | e p , f ) =  X  m being a scaling factor for model m , h m the log-probability of each model considered in the log-lineal interpolation and Z a normalisation factor.
Finally, to balance the absolute values of the mor-phological model, the constrained language model and the IMT model, these probabilities are com-bined in a log-linear manner regardless of the lan-guage modelling approach. The Xerox corpus, created on the TT2 project (SchulmbergerSema S.A. et al., 2001), was used for these experiments, since it has been extensively used in the literature to obtain IMT results. The simplified English and Spanish versions were used to estimate the IMT, IBM and language models. The corpus consists of 56 k sentences of training and a development and test sets of 1 . 1 k sentences. Test perplexities for Spanish and English are 33 and 48 , respectively.
 For on-line HTR, the on-line handwritten UNIPEN corpus (Guyon et al., 1994) was used. The morphological models were represented by con-tinuous density left-to-right character HMMs with Gaussian mixtures, as in speech recognition (Ra-biner, 1989), but with variable number of states per character. Feature extraction consisted on speed and size normalisation of pen positions and veloc-ities, resulting in a sequence of vectors of six fea-tures (Toselli et al., 2007).

The simulation of user interaction was performed in the following way. First, the publicly available IMT decoder Thot (Ortiz-Mart  X   X nez et al., 2005) 1 was used to run an off-line simulation for keyboard-based IMT. As a result, a list of words the system independent HTR (  X  ) 9 . 6 10 . 9 7 . 7 9 . 6 decoupled ( ? ) 9 . 5 10 . 8 7 . 2 9 . 6 best coupled 6 . 7 8 . 9 5 . 5 7 . 2 failed to predict was obtained. Supposedly, this is the list of words that the user would like to cor-rect with handwriting. Then, from UNIPEN cor-pus, three users (separated from the training) were selected to simulate user interaction. For each user, the handwritten words were generated by concate-nating random character instances from the user X  X  data to form a single stroke. Finally, the generated handwritten words of the three users were decoded using the corresponding constrained language model with a state-of-the-art HMM decoder, iAtros (Luj  X  an-Mares et al., 2008). 3.1 Results Results are presented in classification error rate (CER), i.e. the ratio between the errors committed by the on-line HTR decoder and the number of hand-written words introduced by the user. All the results have been calculated as the average CER of the three users.

Table 1 shows a comparison between the best results in this work and the approaches in previ-ous work. The log-linear and linear weights were obtained with the simplex algorithm (Nelder and Mead, 1965) to optimise the development set. Then, those weights were used for the test set.

Two baseline models have been established for comparison purposes. On the one hand, (  X  ) is a completely independent and context unaware sys-tem. That would be the equivalent to decode the handwritten text in a separate on-line HTR decoder. This system obtains the worst results of all. On the other hand, ( ? ) is the most similar model to the best system in (Alabau et al., 2010). This system is clearly outperformed by the proposed coupled ap-proach.

However, the results did not show significant differences between them, except for the 1-gram. Thus, context does not seem to im-prove much the performance. This may be due to the fact that the IMT and the on-line HTR systems use the same language models (5-gram in the case of the IMT system). Hence, if the IMT has failed to predict the correct word because of poor language modelling that will affect on-line HTR decoding as well. In fact, although language perplexities for the test sets are quite low ( 33 for Spanish and 48 for En-glish), perplexities accounting only erroneous words increase until 305 and 420 , respectively.

On the contrary, using IBM models provides a significant boost in performance. Although in-verse dictionaries have a better vocabulary coverage ( 4 . 7% vs 8 . 9% in English, 7 . 4% vs 10 . 4% in Span-ish), they tend to perform worse than their direct dictionary counterparts. Still, inverse IBM models perform better than the n-grams alone. Log-linear models show a bit of improvement with respect to IBM models. However, linear interpolated models perform the best. In the Spanish test set the result is not better that the IBM2 since the linear parameters are clearly over-fitted. Other model combinations (including a combination of all models) were tested. Nevertheless, none of them outperformed the best system in Table 2. 3.2 Error Analysis An analysis of the results showed that 52 . 2% to 61 . 7% of the recognition errors were produced by punctuation and other symbols. To circumvent this problem, we proposed a contextual menu in (Al-abau et al., 2010). With such menu, errors would have been reduced (best test result) to 4 . 1% in Span-ish and 2 . 8% in English. Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words also summed up a big percentage of the error ( 29 . 1% and 20 . 4% , respectively). This difference is due to the fact that Spanish is a more inflected language. To solve this problem on-line learning al-gorithms or methods for dealing with OOV words should be used. Errors in gender, number and verb tenses, which rose up to 7 . 7% and 5 . 3% of the er-rors, could be tackled using linguistic information from both source and target sentences. Finally, the rest of the errors were mostly due to one-to-three letter words, which is basically a problem of hand-writing morphological modelling. In this paper we have described a specific on-line HTR system that can serve as an alternative interac-tion modality to IMT. We have shown that a tight in-tegration of the HTR and IMT decoding process and the use of the available information can produce sig-nificant HTR error reductions. Finally, a study of the system X  X  errors has revealed the system weaknesses, and how they could be addressed in the future.
