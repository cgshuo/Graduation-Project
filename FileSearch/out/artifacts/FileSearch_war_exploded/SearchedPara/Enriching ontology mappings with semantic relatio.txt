An ontology O consists of a set of concepts C and relation R , where each r that each relation in O is either of type  X  is-a  X  or of type from a root to a concept is called a concept path . We denote concept paths as follows: root . concept concept is referenced by its label .
 A correspondence C between two ontologies O 1 and O 2 consists of a source concept c correspondence to determine its semantic relation type. The

For relation type detection, STROMA needs to combine the results of the one type per correspondence or  X  undecided  X  if no type can be con  X  inverse is-a  X  , while Multiple Linkage decided on  X  is-a  X  we derive the highest score for  X  inverse is-a  X  so that this type is assigned to the correspondence.

 equivalence correspondences. Given a default threshold  X  for the minimal con value s , we now apply the following selection rules: 1. If s  X   X  we accept the correspondence to the fi nal mapping without restrictions. correspondence to improve precision.

With this selection step we aim at an improved recall for the because each correspondence accepted from the critical interval [ 5. Implemented strategies applicable. By contrast, Structure and Itemization are more speci does not depend on other strategies, but rather on the relative size of the input ontologies. experiments with different taxonomies containing itemizations. 5.1. Compound strategy In linguistics, a compound is a special word W that consists of a head W speci fi es W H [3] . Inmanycases, a compoundthus expresses somethingmore speci rather more-general (inverse is-a) than more-speci fi c, as in Bosnia bitter  X  sweet, which means both bitter and sweet (not necessarily a (as in blackboard ).
 Compound approach allows us to identify the three is-a correspondences shown in Fig. 1 (bottom).
We added an additional rule to this simple approach: B is only considered a compound to A if length ( B ) although we cannot cover all cases, such as derivations like (disadvantage, advantage).
For this reason, we also keep a list of common English pre many cases. We therefore discard such correspondences from the match result, since they are probably incorrect.
We also tested a variation of the approach where we extracted the modi appears in a word list or dictionary. This would prevent false conclusions where the pseudomodi occurs only once in a language and has (today) no speci fi and scienti fi ccompoundswhosemodi fi ers are of fi cial words of a language, but are too speci list or dictionary, e.g., in the medical domain. For this reason, checking the modi pursue this idea.

 WordNet as well as several other sources for background knowledge (see below). not, we gradually remove the modi fi ers of C in order to detect the relations. We start with the left-hand modi whetherthenew form C  X  is found in the dictionary. If C  X  that the actual concept C is a hyponym of C  X  (as it is a compound). If C head of C . This method does not work with other compound types, though most speci compounds. We call this technique Gradual Modi fi er Removal .

The implementation of Gradual Modi fi er Removal for an open compound C = mH consisting of a modi mind that H can also be a compound) that matches the non-compound concept W is as follows: 1. Is W contained in the dictionary? YES:Proceedwithstep2.

No: Type cannot be determined. 2. From C remove the modi fi er m so that C  X  = H .Is C  X  YES:Proceedwithstep3.

NO: Proceed with step 2. 3. Is rel ( C  X  , W )  X  { equal , isa }? YES: Return relation type  X  is-a  X  .
 NO: Type cannot be determined.

For instance, we encountered correspondences such as  X  US Vice President dictionary. However,  X  Vice President  X  is in the dictionary, so after the a). Since  X  US Vice President  X  is a  X  Vice President  X  (Compound approach) and we assign the is-a relation to the correspondence.

Givena correspondence ( C 1 , C 2 ) let's assumethat we want to testthis correspondence for anis-a relation.We concepts are represented in the dictionary. If so, we retrieve all hypernyms of C by this set. If not, we retrieve the hypernyms H ( C i ) for each C this procedure until we fi nd C 2 in a hypernym set or reach the root concepts of WordNet. were carefully assigned by linguists. We observed that WordNet is a very reliable source that helps believed to comprise about a million words, not even including very speci computing .

Additionally, we use OpenThesaurus and parts of the UMLS Metathesaurus as background knowledge. OpenThesaurus source to deal with German-language scenarios. for the rather speci fi cdomainitcovers. 5.3. Itemization strategy as a list of items, where an item is a word or phrase that does not contain commas, slashes or the words concepts containing only one item simple concepts , like  X  like  X  Champagne and Wine  X  .

Regarding itemizations also prevents us from detecting pseudocompounds, like there are is-a relations between the items of an itemization. This is necessary to is equivalent to a concept  X  computer  X  , since laptop is just a subset of computer.
We now show how our approach determines the correspondence types between two concepts C concepts is an itemization with more than one item. Let I w  X  w 2 . Our approach works as follows: 1. In each set I remove each w 1  X  I which is a hyponym of w 2. In each set I , replace a synonym pair ( w 1  X  I , w 2 3. Remove each w 1  X  I 1 , w 2  X  I 2 if there is a synonym pair ( w 4. Remove each w 2  X  I 2 which is a hyponym of w 1  X  I 1 . 5. Determine the relation type: (a) If I 1 =  X  , I 2 =  X  :equal (b) If I 1 =  X  ,| I 2 |  X  1: is-a (c) If | I 1 |  X  1, I 2 =  X  : inverse is-a (d) If | I 1 |  X  1, I 2  X  1: undecided.
 compare what is left in the two sets and come to the conclusions presented in step 5.
Let us consider the concept pair C 1 =  X  books, ebooks, movies, loss of information (steps 1 + 2). We remove fi lms in I 1 cds in either set (step 3). Lastly, we remove a hyponym in I book .Wehave I 1 ={ books , movies }, I 2 =  X  .Since I 1 still contains items, while I general, i.e., it holds C 1 inverse is-a C 2 .
 5.4. Structure strategy we check whether we can derive a semantic relation between a father concept X of Y and Z (or vice versa).
For an is-a relation between Y and X we draw the following conclusions:  X 
X equiv Z  X  Y is-a Z  X  X is-a Z  X  Y is-a Z.

For a part-of relation between Y and X we can analogously derive:  X 
X equiv Z  X  Y part-of Z  X  X part-of Z  X  Y part-of Z .
 of concepts for which the semantic relation cannot directly be determined.
For example, consider the correspondence (vehicles.cars.convertibles, vehicles.cars). Let us assume that dictionary. No other strategy would trigger here. However, it can be seen that the leaf node father of the leaf node in the fi rst concept. Since  X  convertibles relation for the correspondence.

 ( Section 6.2 ). We then evaluate the enrichment approach mapping ( Section 6.6 ). Finally, we compare our approach with S-Match and TaxoMap ( Section 6.7 ). 6.1. Evaluation measures
We denote the untyped match mapping used as input for enrichment with M and the enriched mapping with semantic (highlighted in dark gray) for the benchmark. Hence, their intersection considered relation type.
 based on the mapping cardinalities (number of correspondences): recall/precision ( r e / p e )de fi ned as follows: and may contain false correspondences (it always holds that r although these correspondences might be correctly typed (e.g., set missing in the input mapping M and thus in ME , e.g., set accuracy of relation type detection. It holds that r e geqr
Inaddition to theseoverall measures, we evaluate the type-speci recall/precision ( type may refer to any relation type such as is-a):
We illustrate the introduced measure swithanexample.Let'sassumethat| B |=| BE | = 100, | M |=| ME |=150and| B results in a recall r = 80/100 = 0.8 and a precision p = 80/150 = 0.53 for input mapping M .Let'ssaythat| BE 70 of the 80 correspondences in | B  X  M | were correctly typed. We have r the strict precision p s = 70/150 = 0.47.

Assume now that the number of is-a correspondences in the benchmark is | BE alsoassumethatthenumber of correctly typedis-a correspondences is | BE them are truly of type  X  is-a  X  .

We thus have a strict recall r s ( isa ) = 45/80 = 0.56 and an effective recall r 100 = 0.45, while the effective precision is p e ( isa ) =45/60=0.75. 6.2.
