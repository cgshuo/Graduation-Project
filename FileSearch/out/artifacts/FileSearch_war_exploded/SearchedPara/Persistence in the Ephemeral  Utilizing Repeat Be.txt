As the abundance of information on the Internet grows, an increasing burden is placed on the user to specify his or her query precisely in order to avoid extraneous results that may be relevant, but not useful. At the same time, users have a tendency to repeat their search behaviors, seeking the same URL (re-finding)[2, 5] as well as issuing the same query (re-searching)[1, 3, 4]. These repeated actions reveal a form of user preference that the search engine can utilize to personalize the results.

In our approach, we personalize search results related to ongoing tasks, allowing for a different degree of strength of interest , and diversity of interest per task. We use both re-finding and re-searching to identify tasks, and user pref-erence within the task. Such task based queries may be of higher value than non-task related queries, since they may be used again in the future.

When a user re-finds within a task, he or she shows a strong interest in the particular URL, or the specific con-tent from the URL. Within the same task, users also have a tendency to seek new information in terms of new URLs, and new content. This action is a form of diversity seeking. Some of these new found URLs may be related, revealing subtopics that are of interest to the user. When the user clicks on multiple related results, but does not re-find those results, he or she may be looking for new content within the subtopic. The goal of task oriented multi-session search is to support the dual need of personalized diversification, as well as the need to return to valuable information.
Consider an example of a user searching for colleges. She clicks on academic rankings frequently, occasionally clicking on athletics and fraternities while skipping over sites con-cerning campus dinning. As she continues her search over time, her often re-found URLs reveal her primary interests, but the clicks on athletics and fraternities show shallow in-terests in these areas. The search engine could filter out topics for which she shows no interest, provide greater di-versification for her shallow interests and help her re-find her deep interests.

Users usually multi-task, and could be engaged in multi-ple tasks in any given session. If we consider the task to be the state the user is in, then each new query issued by the user is an observed variable indicating whether the user has transitioned to a new task. The transition probability could depend on all past tasks the user has previously been engaged in within the session, as well as where the user is in the session. A natural model for task identification would be a conditional random field.

Predicting whether a URL will be clicked depends on the probability of the URL to satisfy the user X  X  need to re-find or find new information via diversification. The URL will satisfy a user X  X  diversification needs if it is relevant to the subtopics the user is interested in. The probability to satisfy a user X  X  re-finding needs depends on how often and when it was previously clicked. This concept is closely related to the constant elasticity of substitution property in economics, which models the relative gain of a repeated action. Thus we will explore using economics and probabilistic models to solve the task oriented multi-session search problem. [1] A. Aula, N. Jhaveri, and M. K  X  aki. Information search [2] H.
