 Service-oriented computing (SOC) suggests that the Internet will be an open repository of millions of modular capabilities realized as web services. Organi zations may be able to leverage this SOC paradigm if their empl oyees are able to ubiquitously incorporate such capabilities and their resulting information into their daily practices. This paper presents an architecture, Software Agent-Based Groupware using E-services (SAGE), that incorporates the use of inte lligent agents to help integrate organizational processes with we b services. Our first steps toward the development of S AGE consist of an operational concept and middleware prototype (i.e. groupware plug-in) to mediate service-oriented information.

Design, Experimentation, Standardization, Languages Service-oriented computing, ag ents, groupware, web services Service-oriented Computing (SOC) is a paradigm where the capabilities of network-accessible services (i.e. web services) can be easily searched by and integrated among multiple organizations. In this paper, we suggest that smaller specialized teams may also benefit from the incorporation of services available both among the team members and broadly throughout their enterprise or perhaps even from the Internet. It may be unrealistic for human stakeholders to search and track relevant services in the context of thei r job. Consequently, we propose the use of automated, adaptive software techniques (i.e. intelligent software agents), to facilitate the integration of human-managed processes and potential service-oriented capabilities. Furthermore, we characterize these techniques in the context of intelligence analysts that track individuals for the benefit of national security. Although there are other agent-based approaches for groupware [3][4], this is perhaps the first study that attempts to integrate agent-mediated groupware with open services in context of evolving web services paradigms. Furthermore, we introduce a publish and subscribe technique [1] to uniquely implement three different interfaces, agent-to-agent (implicitly analyst-to-analyst), agent-to-web service, a nd agent-to-web information. The SAGE project is toward the establishment of general capabilities to allow human users to incorporate services into their group-oriented processes. In the context of the architecture, a lead analyst performs his daily procedures. SAGE agents would maintain a knowledge base consisting of keywords and historical actions of the analyst. Either through the request of the analyst or proactively, in th e future, the agent queries other agents in addition to open service repositories to find information or relevant services. This architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. SAGE application has currently been implemented in Beta form using the Java Web Services Deve lopment Kit, Jess rule engine, and WSDL4J (for integration with web service descriptions). Although the use of agents in gr oupware is promising, very few projects exist. However, there are other agent-based groupware projects [3][4] that focus on the social effects of the human collaboration. This work takes a systems approach by addressing the ability to integrate human processes with external software capabilities. In future st udies, we plan to experiment with the SAGE approach using a real-time simulated intelligence community.
