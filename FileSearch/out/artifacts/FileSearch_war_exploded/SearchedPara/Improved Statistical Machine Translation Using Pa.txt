 As with many other statistical natural language pro-cessing tasks, statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) produces high quality results when am-ple training data is available. This is problematic for so called  X  X ow density X  language pairs which do not have very large parallel corpora. For example, when words occur infrequently in a parallel corpus param-eter estimates for word-level alignments can be in-accurate, which can in turn lead to inaccurate phrase translations. Limited amounts of training data can further lead to a problem of low coverage in that many phrases encountered at run-time are not ob-served in the training data and therefore their trans-lations will not be learned.
 Here we address the problem of unknown phrases. Specifically we show that upon encountering an un-known source phrase, we can substitute a paraphrase for it and then proceed using the translation of that paraphrase. We derive these paraphrases from re-sources that are external to the parallel corpus that the translation model is trained from, and we are able to exploit (potentially more abundant) parallel corpora from other language pairs to do so.

In this paper we:  X  Define a method for incorporating paraphrases  X  Show that by translating paraphrases we  X  Argue that while we observe an improvement  X  Present an alternative methodology for targeted Statistical machine translation made considerable advances in translation quality with the introduc-tion of phrase-based translation (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004). By Figure 1: Percent of unique unigrams, bigrams, tri-grams, and 4-grams from the Europarl Spanish test sentences for which translations were learned in in-creasingly large training corpora increasing the size of the basic unit of translation, phrase-based machine translation does away with many of the problems associated with the original word-based formulation of statistical machine trans-lation (Brown et al., 1993). For instance, with multi-word units less re-ordering needs to occur since lo-cal dependencies are frequently captured. For exam-ple, common adjective-noun alternations are mem-orized. However, since this linguistic information is not explicitly and generatively encoded in the model, unseen adjective noun pairs may still be han-dled incorrectly.

Thus, having observed phrases in the past dramat-ically increases the chances that they will be trans-lated correctly in the future. However, for any given test set, a huge amount of training data has to be ob-served before translations are learned for a reason-able percentage of the test phrases. Figure 1 shows the extent of this problem. For a training corpus containing 10,000 words translations will have been learned for only 10% of the unigrams ( types , not tokens). For a training corpus containing 100,000 words this increases to 30%. It is not until nearly 10,000,000 words worth of training data have been analyzed that translation for more than 90% of the vocabulary items have been learned. This problem is obviously compounded for higher-order n-grams (longer phrases), and for morphologically richer lan-guages. encargarnos to ensure, take care, ensure that garantizar guarantee, ensure, guaranteed, as-velar ensure, ensuring, safeguard, making procurar ensure that, try to, ensure, endeavour asegurarnos ensure, secure, make certain usado used utilizado used, use, spent, utilized empleado used, spent, employee uso use, used, usage utiliza used, uses, used, being used utilizar to use, use, used Table 1: Example of automatically generated para-phrases for the Spanish words encargarnos and us-ado along with their English translations which were automatically learned from the Europarl corpus 2.1 Handling unknown words Currently most statistical machine translation sys-tems are simply unable to handle unknown words. There are two strategies that are generally employed when an unknown source word is encountered. Ei-ther the source word is simply omitted when pro-ducing the translation, or alternatively it is passed through untranslated, which is a reasonable strategy if the unknown word happens to be a name (assum-ing that no transliteration need be done). Neither of these strategies is satisfying. 2.2 Using paraphrases in SMT When a system is trained using 10,000 sentence pairs (roughly 200,000 words) there will be a num-ber of words and phrases in a test sentence which it has not learned the translation of. For example, the Spanish sentence may translate as
The strategy that we employ for dealing with un-known source language words is to substitute para-phrases of those words, and then translate the para-phrases. Table 1 gives examples of paraphrases and their translations. If we had learned a translation of garantizar we could translate it instead of encargar-nos , and similarly for utilizado instead of usado . Paraphrases are alternative ways of expressing the same information within one language. The auto-matic generation of paraphrases has been the focus of a significant amount of research lately. Many methods for extracting paraphrases (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003) make use of monolingual parallel corpora, such as multiple trans-lations of classic French novels into English, or the multiple reference translations used by many auto-matic evaluation metrics for machine translation.
Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) use bilin-gual parallel corpora to generate paraphrases. Para-phrases are identified by pivoting through phrases in another language. The foreign language translations of an English phrase are identified, all occurrences of those foreign phrases are found, and all English phrases that they translate back to are treated as po-tential paraphrases of the original English phrase. Figure 2 illustrates how a German phrase can be used as a point of identification for English para-phrases in this way.
 The method defined in Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) has several features that make it an ideal candidate for incorporation into statistical ma-chine translation system. Firstly, it can easily be ap-plied to any language for which we have one or more parallel corpora. Secondly, it defines a paraphrase probability, p ( e the probabilistic framework of SMT. 3.1 Paraphrase probabilities The paraphrase probability p ( e in terms of two translation model probabilities: p ( f | e 1 ) , the probability that the original English phrase e other language, and p ( e candidate paraphrase e guage phrase. Since e eign language phrases, we marginalize f out:
The translation model probabilities can be com-puted using any standard formulation from phrase-based machine translation. For example, p ( e can be calculated straightforwardly using maximum likelihood estimation by counting how often the phrases e and f were aligned in the parallel corpus:
There is nothing that limits us to estimating para-phrases probabilities from a single parallel corpus. We can extend the definition of the paraphrase prob-ability to include multiple corpora, as follows: where c is a parallel corpus from a set of paral-lel corpora C . Thus multiple corpora may be used by summing over all paraphrase probabilities calcu-lated from a single corpus (as in Equation 1) and normalized by the number of parallel corpora. We examined the application of paraphrases to deal with unknown phrases when translating from Span-ish and French into English. We used the pub-licly available Europarl multilingual parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005) to create six training corpora for the two language pairs, and used the standard Europarl development and test sets. 4.1 Baseline For a baseline system we produced a phrase-based statistical machine translation system based on the log-linear formulation described in (Och and Ney, 2002) The baseline model had a total of eight feature functions, h ity, a phrase translation probability, a reverse phrase translation probability, lexical translation probabil-ity, a reverse lexical translation probability, a word penalty, a phrase penalty, and a distortion cost. To set the weights,  X  rate training (Och, 2003) on the development set us-ing Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) as the objective func-tion.

The phrase translation probabilities were deter-mined using maximum likelihood estimation over phrases induced from word-level alignments pro-duced by performing Giza++ training on each of the three training corpora. We used the Pharaoh beam-search decoder (Koehn, 2004) to produce the trans-lations after all of the model parameters had been set.

When the baseline system encountered unknown words in the test set, its behavior was simply to re-produce the foreign word in the translated output. This is the default behavior for many systems, as noted in Section 2.1. 4.2 Translation with paraphrases We extracted all source language (Spanish and French) phrases up to length 10 from the test and development sets which did not have translations in phrase tables that were generated for the three train-ing corpora. For each of these phrases we gener-ated a list of paraphrases using all of the parallel cor-pora from Europarl aside from the Spanish-English and French-English corpora. We used bitexts be-tween Spanish and Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Swedish to gener-ate our Spanish paraphrases, and did similarly for the French paraphrases. We manage the parallel corpora with a suffix array -based data structure (Callison-Burch et al., 2005). We calculated para-phrase probabilities using the Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) method, summarized in Equation 3. Source language phrases that included names and numbers were not paraphrased.

For each paraphrase that had translations in the phrase table, we added additional entries in the phrase table containing the original phrase and the paraphrase X  X  translations. We augmented the base-line model by incorporating the paraphrase probabil-ity into an additional feature function which assigns values as follows: h ( e , f 1 ) = Just as we did in the baseline system, we performed minimum error rate training to set the weights of the nine feature functions in our translation model that exploits paraphrases.

We tested the usefulness of the paraphrase fea-ture function by performing an additional experi-ment where the phrase table was expanded but the paraphrase probability was omitted. 4.3 Evaluation We evaluated the efficacy of using paraphrases in three ways: by calculating the Bleu score for the translated output, by measuring the increase in cov-erage when including paraphrases, and through a tar-geted manual evaluation of the phrasal translations of unseen phrases to determine how many of the newly covered phrases were accurately translated. Figure 3: Test sentences and reference translations were manually word-aligned. This allowed us to equate unseen phrases with their corresponding En-glish phrase. In this case enumeradas with listed . Although Bleu is currently the standard metric for MT evaluation, we believe that it may not meaning-fully measure translation improvements in our setup. By substituting a paraphrase for an unknown source phrase there is a strong chance that its translation may also be a paraphrase of the equivalent target language phrase. Bleu relies on exact matches of n-grams in a reference translation. Thus if our trans-lation is a paraphrase of the reference, Bleu will fail to score it correctly.

Because Bleu is potentially insensitive to the type of changes that we were making to the translations, we additionally performed a focused manual evalu-ation (Callison-Burch et al., 2006). To do this, had bilingual speakers create word-level alignments for the first 150 and 250 sentence in the Spanish-English and French-English test corpora, as shown in Figure 3. We were able to use these alignments to extract the translations of the Spanish and French words that we were applying our paraphrase method to.

Knowing this correspondence between foreign phrases and their English counterparts allowed us to directly analyze whether translations that were be-ing produced from paraphrases remained faithful to the meaning of the reference translation. When pro-

 Figure 4: Judges were asked whether the highlighted phrase retained the same meaning as the highlighted phrase in the reference translation (top) ducing our translations using the Pharaoh decoder we employed its  X  X race X  facility, which tells which source sentence span each target phrase was derived from. This allowed us to identify which elements in the machine translated output corresponded to the paraphrased foreign phrase. We asked a monolin-gual judge whether the phrases in the machine trans-lated output had the same meaning as of the refer-ence phrase. This is illustrated in Figure 4.
In addition to judging the accuracy of 100 phrases for each of the translated sets, we measured how much our paraphrase method increased the cover-age of the translation system. Because we focus on words that the system was previously unable to translate, the increase in coverage and the transla-tion quality of the newly covered phrases are the two most relevant indicators as to the efficacy of the method. We produced translations under five conditions for each of our training corpora: a set of baseline translations without any additional entries in the phrase table, a condition where we added the trans-lations of paraphrases for unseen source words along with paraphrase probabilities, a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases of multi-word phrases along with paraphrase probabilities, and two additional conditions where we added the transla-tions of paraphrases of single and multi-word para-phrase without paraphrase probabilities. measured in sentences.
 5.1 Bleu scores Table 2 gives the Bleu scores for each of these con-ditions. We were able to measure a translation im-provement for all sizes of training corpora, under both the single word and multi-word conditions, ex-cept for the largest Spanish-English corpus. For the single word condition, it would have been surprising if we had seen a decrease in Bleu score. Because we are translating words that were previously untrans-latable it would be unlikely that we could do any worse. In the worst case we would be replacing one word that did not occur in the reference translation with another, and thus have no effect on Bleu.
More interesting is the fact that by paraphrasing unseen multi-word units we get an increase in qual-ity above and beyond the single word paraphrases. These multi-word units may not have been observed in the training data as a unit, but each of the compo-nent words may have been. In this case translating a paraphrase would not be guaranteed to received an improved or identical Bleu score, as in the single word case. Thus the improved Bleu score is notable.
Table 3 shows that incorporating the paraphrase probability into the model X  X  feature functions plays a critical role. Without it, the multi-word paraphrases harm translation performance when compared to the baseline. 5.2 Manual evaluation We performed a manual evaluation by judging the accuracy of phrases for 100 paraphrased translations from each of the sets using the manual word align-each of the translations of paraphrases were judged to have the same meaning as the equivalent target phrase. In the case of the translations of single word paraphrases for the Spanish accuracy ranged from just below 50% to just below 70%. This number is impressive in light of the fact that none of those items are correctly translated in the baseline model, which simply inserts the foreign language word. As with the Bleu scores, the translations of multi-word paraphrases were judged to be more accurate than the translations of single word paraphrases.
In performing the manual evaluation we were ad-ditionally able to determine how often Bleu was ca-pable of measuring an actual improvement in trans-lation. For those items judged to have the same meaning as the gold standard phrases we could track how many would have contributed to a higher Bleu score (that is, which of them were exactly the same as the reference translation phrase, or had some words in common with the reference trans-lation phrase). By counting how often a correct phrase would have contributed to an increased Bleu score, and how often it would fail to increase the Bleu score we were able to determine with what fre-quency Bleu was sensitive to our improvements. We found that Bleu was insensitive to our translation im-provements between 60-75% of the time, thus re-Corpus size 10k 20k 40k 80k 160k 320k 10k 20k 40k 80k 160k 320k Multi-word 64% 65% 66% 71% 76%  X  71%  X  60% 67% 63% 58% 65% 42%  X  taken as reliable estimates.
 Table 5: The percent of the unique test set phrases which have translations in each of the Spanish-English training corpora prior to paraphrasing inforcing our belief that it is not an appropriate mea-sure for translation improvements of this sort. 5.3 Increase in coverage As illustrated in Figure 1, translation models suffer from sparse data. When only a very small paral-lel corpus is available for training, translations are learned for very few of the unique phrases in a test set. If we exclude 451 words worth of names, num-bers, and foreign language text in 2,000 sentences that comprise the Spanish portion of the Europarl test set, then the number of unique n-grams in text are: 7,331 unigrams, 28,890 bigrams, 44,194 tri-grams, and 48,259 4-grams. Table 5 gives the per-centage of these which have translations in each of the three training corpora, if we do not use para-phrasing.

In contrast after expanding the phrase table using the translations of paraphrases, the coverage of the unique test set phrases goes up dramatically (shown in Table 6). For the first training corpus with 10,000 sentence pairs and roughly 200,000 words of text in each language, the coverage goes up from less than 50% of the vocabulary items being covered to 90%. The coverage of unique 4-grams jumps from 3% to 16%  X  a level reached only after observing more Table 6: The percent of the unique test set phrases which have translations in each of the Spanish-English training corpora after paraphrasing than 100,000 sentence pairs, or roughly three mil-lion words of text, without using paraphrases. Previous research on trying to overcome data spar-sity issues in statistical machine translation has largely focused on introducing morphological anal-ysis as a way of reducing the number of types ob-served in a training text. For example, Nissen and Ney (2004) apply morphological analyzers to En-glish and German and are able to reduce the amount of training data needed to reach a certain level of translation quality. Goldwater and McClosky (2005) find that stemming Czech and using lemmas improves the word-to-word correspondences when training Czech-English alignment models. Koehn and Knight (2003) show how monolingual texts and parallel corpora can be used to figure out appropriate places to split German compounds.

Still other approaches focus on ways of acquiring data. Resnik and Smith (2003) develop a method for gathering parallel corpora from the web. Oard et al. (2003) describe various methods employed for quickly gathering resources to create a machine translation system for a language with no initial re-sources. In this paper we have shown that significant gains in coverage and translation quality can be had by inte-grating paraphrases into statistical machine transla-tion. In effect, paraphrases introduce some amount of generalization into statistical machine translation. Whereas before we relied on having observed a par-ticular word or phrase in the training set in order to produce a translation of it, we are no longer tied to having seen every word in advance. We can exploit knowledge that is external to the translation model about what words have similar meanings and use that in the process of translation. This method is particularly pertinent to small data conditions, which are plagued by sparse data problems.

In future work, we plan to determine how much data is required to learn useful paraphrases. The sce-nario described in this paper was very favorable to creating high quality paraphrases. The large number of parallel corpora between Spanish and the other languages present in the Europarl corpus allowed us to generate high quality, in domain data. While this is a realistic scenario, in that many new official languages have been added to the European Union, some of which do not yet have extensive parallel cor-pora, we realize that this may be a slightly idealized scenario.

Finally, we plan to formalize our targeted manual evaluation method, in the hopes of creating a eval-uation methodology for machine translation that is more thorough and elucidating than Bleu.
