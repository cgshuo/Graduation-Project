 The popularity of social networking platforms ( e.g., Twitter and Facebook ) is redefining the roles of information provider and information consumer and changing the way people access and recei ve information online. On the one hand, more users receive information pushed by o ther users through social platforms, which potentially reduces the number of direct visits to news websites. On the other hand, news websites remain important mainstream media for providing high-quality news articles written by professionals and offering comprehensive news coverage.

To be better connected with users and attract more visits, most news websites facilitate social interactions among their readers in at least three forms. One form of social interaction is to enable user discussion through comments to the news articles. Comments received from reade rs are maintained by the news websites and are often presented together with the news articles to the next readers [6]. Another form of social interaction is to minimize the effort for users to share a news article to her social networks. Many news websites provide a list of buttons; sharing a news article to Facebook, Twitter or other social networks becomes a single click of a button. The last form of social interaction is to directly push news articles to the social networks through the news providers X  accounts registered with the social networks. It is observed that mass media accounts ( e.g., CNN Breaking News, the New York Times, TIME) gain large followership in Twitter [9]. The link (often with a short description) of a news article then reaches more users in a social network though user re-sharing. The next question is: to what extent the user commenting and sharing mechanism influence news article viewership?
In this paper, we take the very first step and report a preliminary study on the most-popular news articles from a major news provider and try to answer the following questions: (i) are the most-viewed news articles most-shared, and vice versa? and (ii) are the most-viewed news articles most-commented, and vice versa? The answers to the above questions would help the news providers to better understand users X  news reading behavior, so as to improve the effectiveness of news delivery to users through all possible channels including social platforms and news personalization or recommendation [4,11,12].

In the following, we first present the data collected for this study and then report the analysis based on topic modeling and named entity extraction. We collected the most-popular headlines published by Yahoo! News 1 for about two months from 15 April 2013 to 13 June 2013. Illustrated in Figure 1, the popular news headlines are categorized into most-popular, most-viewed, most-shared, and most-commented, for five s ections: All, U.S., World, Science, and Health. For each kind of popular news ( e.g., most-viewed) in each section, max-imum 100 news headlines are listed. We crawled the popular headlines and the full content of the news articles on daily basis at a fixed time. The number of distinct news articles collected for m ost-viewed/-commented/-shared in each section is listed in Table 1. We do not include the category  X  X ost-popular X  in our following study because the meaning of popular here is not clearly defined. Observe from Table 1, the number of news falling under Health and Science sections is much smaller compared to the other three sections probably due to topic specificity.
The first row in Table 2 reports the conditional probability of a news ar-ticle being most-viewed provided it i s one of the most-commented articles in one of the five sections. Similarly, the conditional probabilities of being most-commented/most-shared are reported in the table. Observe that, the conditional probabilities reported under the Health and Science sections are above 90%. That is, for a news article, reporting a new finding in Health or Science area, if it is one of the most-viewed, very likely, it is one of the most-commented and the most-shared, and vice versa. One possible reason is that Health and Science are relatively topic-specific and the news ar ticles are often about advices or new findings in these two areas with good support from scientific studies. Most users are not experts in Health or Science. Thus users have common background or common context in understanding the news. In other words, users X  self-interests and inter-subjective interests 2 are likely to be the same.

For news articles falling under World and U.S. sections, the conditional proba-bilities are mostly over 80%. Under All section, the chance of a news article being most-viewed is below 70% even if it is on e of the most-shared or most-commented article. That is, for a news article under this section, a good number of users read the article but do not share or comment it. A most-shared article in this section may not attract enough viewership to make it one of the most-viewed article. Compared with World and U.S., n ews articles in All section cover all happenings worldwide and cover various diverse topics. The diverse topics may affect users X  behavior in viewing, comment ing, and sharing the news articles. We therefore conduct our analysis mainly on the news articles in All section. We now analyze the news articles under All section and try to understand why not all most-viewed articles are not among most-shared/-commented or the most-shared/-commented articles are not among the most viewed. To begin with, we make the following assumptions.  X  A news article X  X  viewership consists of two groups of users: (i) users who dis- X  After reading a news article, a user may: (i) leave a comment on the  X  Because we cannot access the exact n umber of views, number of shares,
Let V , S ,and C be the sets of news articles that are most-viewed, most-shared, and most-commented, respectiv ely, in the All section. Next we perform topic modeling to analyze the topic distributions of the documents in All section. 3.1 Analysis by Topic Modeling Topic modeling has demonstrated promising results in understanding the topic distribution of documents as well as in many prediction tasks [2]. Here, we are interested in finding out whether the topics of the news articles influence the viewing, commenting, and sharing behavior. More specifically, we are more in-terested in finding the topics for which the news articles are most-viewed but are less likely to be most-shared (or -co mmented), or the news articles are most-shared (or -commented) but are l ess likely to be most-viewed.

We adopt latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) in our analysis. In LDA, a doc-ument in the collection is a distribution over a set of topics, and each topic is a probabilistic distribution over words. Given all the most-viewed/-shared/-commented documents in All section, we applied standard LDA model with fol-lowing parameter setting: number of topics is set to 100 3 , the Dirichlet prior on the per-document topic distribution  X  =0 . 5, the Dirichlet prior on the per-topic word distribution  X  =0 . 01, the number of iteration is 1000.
 Viewing vs Sharing. With the result of topic modeling, each news article has a distribution over the 100 topics inferred from the news collection. For easy analysis, we assign each news article one topic ( i.e., the topic with the highest probability among the 100 topics for this news article) 4 . With the topic assignment, we get the number of documents for each topic in the set V (most-viewed news articles) and in the set S (most-shared news articles) respectively. For each topic, we then compute its user preference of sharing .Let t s be the number of news articles under topic t in set S , and let t v be the number of news articles under the same topic in set V . The user preference of sharing for topic t is computed as the ratio R s = t s t topic t is computed in a similar manner R v = t v t is among both most-viewed and most-shared, the news article is counted in both t and t v for its assigned topic t .

Table 3 reports the topics selected by the user preference of sharing and viewing. The upper half of the table lists the topics with higher user sharing preference than viewing ranked by R s in descending order; the lower half of the table lists the topics of higher user preference of viewing than sharing ranked by R v in descending order. For each topic, the top-10 most relevant words are listed by their probabilities of belonging to that topic. The topic labels, in boldface in Table 3, are manually assigned based on the topical words and the content of the news articles in the topic. From Table 3, we make the following observations:  X  The top-10 topics with higher preference of sharing and the top-10 topics  X  Users are more willing to share news articles under topics of economy (5  X  Users are less likely to share news articles under topics of sports (3 out of
Usefulness is one of the key motivations users use social networks [10]. A user in a social network therefore carefully se lects who to make friend with and/or who to follow so as to receive useful informatio n from the selected friends/followees. On the other hand, to be able to maintain or increase one X  X  social capital [5,7], it is important for a user to provide useful information to her friends or followers. After reading a news article, a user shares this article to her friends/followers if she believes that this piece of informat ion is useful to others. A piece of useful information in a social network feed has the potential to catch attention, attract new friends/followers, or strength social bonding with other users by initiating a conversation. From this point of view, it becomes reasonable that users are more willing to share news articles under topics of health and economy which are perceived to be more relevant to everyone X  X  daily life or have impact to ev-eryone X  X  daily life in short term ( e.g., news about worker X  X  right and employment environment).
 A user X  X  friends/followers in social networks usually have diverse interests. For example, to users who are not interested in sports, news updates on sports become less relevant or even spam to them. I n particular, followee X  X  informative-ness is a major factor affecting the decision to unfollow in Twitter [8]. Sports news and crime news, in this sense, might not be useful to most other users in a social network unless in a domain-sp ecific community formed by many users sharing the same interest. Another key issue a user has to consider before sharing a news article in social network is that the action of sharing reveals what she reads to all her friends/followers. Depending on her social status, a user may not share news about celebrity gossips for example.
 Viewing vs Commenting. Table 4 lists the top-10 topics with higher user preference for commentin g and top-10 topics with hi gher user preference for viewing respectively, computed in a s imilar manner as that for Table 3. Note that, the topics listed in the lower parts of Table 3 and 4 are different because the user preference for viewing R v is computed differently, one is for viewing against sharing (Table 3) and the other is for viewing against commenting (Table 4).
Observe from Table 4, users have very different preferences for commenting and viewing (but not commenting) news articles. Among the top-10 topics at-tracted lots of comments, 9 of them are politics. For topics with higher user preference of viewing only, 3 are about s ports, 3 are about science and technol-ogy, and 2 are about health. The results suggest that users are willing to express themselves through commenting on news articles about political issues ( e.g., government administration, tax and budget, immigration, and gay marriage). However, these political issues have less impact to most people X  X  daily life, at least in short term. Different from sharing through social networks, commenting on news articles can be made anonymously and the comments are not pushed to the social network feeds. A user therefore has  X  X ore freedom X  of expressing her opinion about a news article without the worry about offending some of her friends/followers who may hold different opinions about the political issues. On the other hand, when sharing a news article ( i.e., its URL) in her social network, a user usually adds a description or her comments to the article. Such descriptions/comments are push to her friends/followers.

We also observe that many comments are organized into conversations through replying to existing comments. A news article in this case serves as a starting thread of a temporal forum facilitating user discussions. Like in most forums, users participating the discussions are not strongly connected through social relationships.

To summarize the key observations made from Tables 3 and 4 based on topic modeling:  X  Sports news often attracts large number of views. However, users are unlikely  X  Health news has higher chance of being viewed and shared, but relatively  X  Economy news is more likely to be shared and politics news is the most 3.2 Analysis by Named Entity A news article often reports an event involving people, organization, location, and time. In this section, we conduct discriminant analysis based on the named entities recognized from the news articles, to find out the named entities that may attract large number of views, shares, or comments.

We utilized the Stanford NLP package 5 to extract names of people, organi-zations, and locations, from the news articles. Recall that we use V , S ,and C to denote the sets of news articles that are most-viewed, most-shared, and most-commented. We now partition the news articles into 4 groups.  X  V  X  S : This is the group of news articles that are among most-viewed articles  X  S  X  V : This is the group of news articles that are among most-shared articles  X  V  X  C : This is the group of news articles that are among most-viewed articles  X  C  X  V : This is the group of news articles that are among most-commented
Based on the extracted named entities, each news article can be represented as a list of named entities contained in it. To find out which are the most discrim-inative named entities for identifying news articles in one group against another ( e.g., V  X  S against S  X  V ), many feature selection t echniques can be applied directly [13]. We adopted Odds Ratio in our analysis for its effectiveness in many text classification tasks.
Table 5 and Table 6 list the top-20 most discriminative named entities for the two groups S  X  V and V  X  S , and the two groups C  X  V and V  X  C , respectively. The type of each named entity determined by the Stanford NLP package ( e.g., [P]erson, [L]ocation, and [O]ganization) is indicated in the front of the name entity. Based on the news articles in which the named entity appear, we manually assign each named entity a topic. Nevertheless, it is hard to identify the topic of some named entities, particularly the named entities referring to country names or locations. Another reason for not being able to identify a topic is that, a name entity extracted is not a full name ( e.g., Berry).

Observe from Table 5, the top-20 most discriminative named entities are mostly organizations for S  X  V while the most discriminative named entities for V  X  S are mostly persons. The topics of named entities are quite consistent with that in Table 3, with economy being the dominate topic covering nearly half of the top-20 named entities. Many of these named entities are from the finance sector such as Federal Reserve, Ben Be rnanke, Dow Jones, IMF, and European Central Bank. Again, we argue that news a rticles related to these named entities have higher chance of affecting many people in short time and are perceived to be useful to many users for sharing. Science and health cover a quarter. The sad stories about the kidnappings of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Michelle Knight 6 gained large viewership but not many sharing.
Let us look at the named entities listed in Table 6. Almost all the named entities attracted large number of comments are from the politics topic. For named entities that attract large viewership but not commenting are mostly sportsman. The two observations are consistent with that from Table 4. Users are willing to comment on politics issues more freely (or even with anonymous ids) without sharing the comments with their friends/followers. On the other hand, news articles about sports gain a la rge readership but receive relatively fewer comments.

To summarize, the observations made from the analysis of named entities are consistent with the observations made from the analysis using topic modeling. User behavior understanding and analysis is a major research topic [5,7]. Partic-ularly the studies on motivation of the use of social networks are related to our work to help to understand the possible reasons that a user would or would not share a news article after reading it. On the other hand, user behavior analysis on social platforms ( e.g., Twitter and Facebook ) has attracted significant re-search interests [3,14]. However, social platform is much more complicated with many more factors ( e.g., number of friends, strength of the relationships, degree of activeness) affecting users X  behavior. In our study, we are more focused on the textual content of the news articles.

The most related work to our study is the analysis of the relationship between different user actions (view, share, comment) reported in [1]. The authors found that the number of times people sharing a news article is related to the number of times people viewing this news article although the correlation is not very strong. This finding is consistent with our findings that users selectively share news articles depending on perceived usefulness of the topic of the news articles. The authors also reported that comparin g to view action and share action, view action and comment action are even less correlated. We show in our study that politics topic receives large number of comments and sports topic receives large number of views but less commenting. In [1], the authors divided the news articles into different categories and found that the correlations between view action and other actions are diverse among categories. However, as the categories are predefined by news publishers, the number of categories is limited and may cover all news articles in fine granularity. In our study, we use topic modeling to infer the topics from the collection of news art icles. Another major difference between our study is that, we use the most-viewed, most-shared, and most-commented news articles which are believed to be more representative for the view, share, and comment actions. The news article s used in [1] were randomly selected. In this paper, we collected two months of m ost-viewed, most-shared, and most-commented news articles from a major news agency. Through topic modeling and named entity analysis we tried to answer the question: are most-viewed news articles most-share d or most-commented, and vice versa? Our analysis re-veals that the sharing and commenting beh avior from users is largely affected by the topic of news. Specifically, sports news articles receive large viewership but are less likely to be shared or commented; politics news articles are more likely to receive large number of comments; users like to share news articles about health and economy. We believe these findings are useful for news agencies in determin-ing the best news promotion strategies to enlarge their readership. The findings are also helpful in the design of news personalization and recommendation sys-tems. Although the lack of exact numbers of views, shares, and comments of the news articles in the data collection is considered as a limitation of this study, we believe the findings remain valid.
