Traditionally recommender systems have been focusing on recommending the most relevant items to users or the most appropriate users to items. While the traditional recommendation technologies have performed reasonably well in several applications, in many other app lications, such as location-and time-based services, including travel recommendations, it may not be sufficient to consider only user s and items  X  it is also important to incorporate contextual information into the recommendation process. In this tutorial, we w ill review various ways of providing recommendation algorithms and suggest possible research directions in this area of recommender systems. We start this tutorial by reviewing the concept of contextual information that is used exte nsively throughout the computer science and then focus on how the contextual information is used in recommender systems. We first explain what contextual information is in recommender syst ems and then present different ways to leverage it in order to provide better recommendations.
