 KDD is that proactive new area of information technology driven by enormous data bases with significant knowledge buried deep inside them. It X  X  objective is to make useful sense out of data. The data is not experimental but opportunistic; it just happens to be there --with alluring potential. It can be diverse, heterogeneous, overwhelming and maybe even non-stationary in sp ace and time. Necessity demands it be analyzed all together. KDD analysis is application-oriented and driven by computation. Probability and statistics are there to help but not drive the process of getting results. Although this situation is on the fringe of statistical tradition, it is not outside the boundary of statistical techniques and statistical thinking. KDD is actually reminiscent of the real beginnings of statistics: there was data to be mined before there was a theory to guide it. KDD did not intend to become statistics; yet, it is not only uses, computing and statistics, and there is much to be achieved --by both data miners and statisticians --in bridging the technique and thinking gap between these two fields. It was a 1965 UCI seminar by Arthur Samuel, on t eaching the computer to play checkers, that inspired me to conceive of the need for meetings at the interface of computer science and statistics. This area is composed of those employing computers for statistical problems, using statistics in computer problems, and utilizing both of them on those significant problems of other important knowledge areas. The first formal meeting, Interface  X 67, had sessions on computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, applications within the Interface, and computer simulation. In 1972, Barry Merrill at State Farm Insurance became the first commercial customer of SAS, when he mined the first data warehouse of SMF records from IBM mainframe computers. From the perspective of the statistical world, decision trees were provided to KDD by Leo Breiman, Jerry Friedman, Richard Olshen and Charles Stone in their 1984 book on the extremely useful CART technique. Both Interface  X 97 and Interface  X 98 Keynote Addresses dealt with KDD: Jerry Friedman said that statistics is no longer the only data game in town, and David Rocke said that the algorithm is the estimator. KDD poses great opportunities, as well as great challenges, for statistics as a field. KDD-97 appeared at Interface  X 98, Interface X 98 is appearing at KDD-98, and KDD-98 will itself appear at Interface  X 99. A relationship is being developed between the two meetings, to lead toward increasing their interaction and o S. Stanley Young &amp; Andrew Rusinko III, "Data Mining of Software technology: o R.
