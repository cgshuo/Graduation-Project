 This paper addresses Named Entity Mining (NEM), in which we mine knowledge about named entities such as movies, games, and books from a huge amount of data. NEM is po-tentially useful in many applications including web search, online advertisement, and recommender system. There are three challenges for the task: finding suitable data source, coping with the ambiguities of named entity classes, and incorporating necessary human supervision into the mining process. This paper proposes conducting NEM by using click-through data collected at a web search engine, employ-ing a topic model that generates the click-through data, and learning the topic model by weak supervision from humans. Specifically, it characterizes each named entity by its associ-ated queries and URLs in the click-through data. It uses the topic model to resolve ambiguities of named entity classes by representing the classes as topics. It employs a method, referred to as Weakly Supervised Latent Dirichlet Alloca-tion (WS-LDA), to accurately learn the topic model with partially labeled named entities. Experiments on a large scale click-through data containing over 1.5 billion query-URL pairs show that the proposed approach can conduct very accurate NEM and significa ntly outperforms the base-line.

Named Entity Mining (NEM) is a text mining task in which the information on the named entities of a class is mined from a large amount of data. The classes can be, for example, movie, game, book and music, and the task can be to mine all the titles of movies in a textual data collection.
NEM is potentially useful in many applications such as web search, online advertisement, and recommender system. For example, if we can identify named entities in search queries using the results of NEM, then we will be able to understand users X  interests and Internet trends better, and deliver search results and ads which are more relevant and interesting to the users. Although there were some studies on NEM and certain progresses were made, further investi-gations on the problem is still needed.

In our view, there are three challenges that stand in the way of achieving high performance NEM: (1) finding a suit-able data source for NEM, because the mining task needs sufficient named entity information existing in the data, (2) effectively dealing with ambiguities in classes of named en-tities because the classes of named entities are highly am-biguous, and (3) properly supervising the mining process, because it would be difficult even for humans to determine the classes of named entities without additional knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new approach to NEM, which (1) makes use of click-through data, (2) employs a topic model on click-through data, (3) learns the topic model us-ing partially labeled seed entities, to overcome the challenges described above. As far as we know, there was no previous work using click-through data and topic model for NEM. (1) Nowadays, web search becomes the major means for people to access information. Click-through data at search engines, containing queries and clicked URLs associated with the queries, emerges as a rich data source for NEM. Ac-cording to our statistics, over 70% queries contain named entities. Furthermore, in the click-through data, the con-texts of named entities in queries and the websites of asso-ciated URLs provide rich clues for identifying the classes of named entities. For example, if named entities appear to-gether with the word  X  X railer X  in queries, then they are likely tobemovies. (Werefertosuchkindofwordsascontexts in this paper.) Moreover, if named entities are associated with the website  X  X mdb.com X  in the click-through data, then they are also likely to be movies. The use of click-through data for NEM has other advantages. The scale of the data is large and thus the wisdom-of-crowds can really be lever-aged. The data can be kept updated and novel knowledge on named entities can be kept discovered.
