 The Quantum Probability Ranking Principle (QPRP) has been recently proposed, and accounts for interdependent document relevance when ranking. However, to be instan-tiated, the QPRP requires a method to approximate the  X  X nterference X  between two documents. In this poster, we empirically evaluate a number of different methods of ap-proximation on two TREC test collections for subtopic re-trieval. It is shown that these approximations can lead to significantly better retrieval performance over the state of the art.

The Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) provides a the-oretically sound ranking strategy, that assumes the inde-pendence between document relevance [7]. To move beyond independence, a number of ranking strategies have been pro-posed which account for interdependent document relevance assessments [6, 8, 9]. A theoretically motivated development that also accounts for this limitation is the recently proposed Quantum Probability Ranking Principle (QPRP) [11]. How-ever, to instantiate a retrieval model that upholds the QPRP the  X  X nterference X  between documents needs to be estimated (see [10] for more details). This ranking principle prescribes that documents should be ranked according to: d i =argmax P ( d )+ where I d,d is the interference between documents d and d , P ( d ) is the estimated probability of relevance of doc-ument d ,and RA is the list of documents already ranked. The angle  X  d,d is the difference between the phases of the probability amplitudes associated to documents d and d . The interference term arises because in quantum probability theory, the total probability obtained from the composition
To study the effectiveness of the strategies proposed in the previous section, we evaluate the QPRP in the context of subtopic retrieval, employing the TREC 678 interactive col-lection with the subtopics judgements described in [9], and the recent ClueWeb collection (part B only), along with the topics defined for the Web diversity track. Using the Lemur Toolkit 4.10 we indexed these collections, where stemming was applied and stop words removed. For the QPRP, we test both pairwise and surrogate comparisons, and exam-ine a number of similarity functions to act as f sim :L1and L2 norms, cosine similarity, J accard coefficients, Pearson X  X  correlation, Bayesian correlation score, KL, JSD, skew diver-gences [5]. The best performing approximations are reported here. Each of the different QPRP approximations were com-pared against the default PRP baseline, i.e. Okapi BM25 and against the state of the art Portfolio Theory (PT) [8] 3 . For PT, we tuned the parameters in each collection to max-imise  X  -ndcg@10. All the models have been implemented in C++/Lemur and code is available on request. We evalu-ated each model employing the diversity measures suggested in [1, 2, 3, 9].
 In Table 1 we report the results for the PRP (i.e. BM25), PT and a subset of the approximations we tried for the QPRP models. First of all we note that the KL based QPRP model performs the best on each collection when surrogates are used in the TREC 678 and pairwise comparisons are used on ClueWeb. These differences might be due to the limited number of topics available for the TREC 678 collection (20 in total), but also because of the different kind of documents in these collections (newswire articles vs. Web pages). Fur-thermore, while no significance can be calculated for the improvements on TREC 678 due to the number of topics, improvements over PRP and PT obtained on ClueWeb are statistically significant. The Pearson based QPRP consis-tently provides excellent retrieval performance regardless of the comparison method -and while this is not always better than the optimised PT, it is not significantly worse, and in
