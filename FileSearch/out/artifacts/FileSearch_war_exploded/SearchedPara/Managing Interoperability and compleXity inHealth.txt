 Data management and knowledge engineering have long been important research fields in computer science, and rapid progress in recent years have increasingly seen these tech-nologies successfully applied to solve complex biomedical challenges and support health services professionals in the course of their intellectually-demanding clinical duties, such as through the use of decision-support or expert systems. Yet, as the biomedical knowledge available in the modern digital world grows exponentially, there is a pressing need for a focused forum to promote technology and knowledge transfer from basic research to biomedical applications as well as allowing for implementers of healthcare systems to share their experiences with the research community. The Managing Interoperability and Complexity in Health Sys-tems, MIXHS workshops are designed for such a purpose with the view that multi-disciplinary approaches within a holistic forum is essential to rise to the ever new challenges of biomedical knowledge complexity and interoperability of health systems and services.
 J.3 [ Computing Applications ]: Life and Medical Sci-ences X  Medical information systems ; H.4.m [ Information Systems Applications ]: Miscellaneous Design, Management, Standardization Bio-medical Knowledge Management; Electronic Health Sys-tems Interoperability and Integration The Managing Interoperability and Complexity in Health Systems (MIXHS) workshops aim: (i) to identify existing challenges in biomedical and health-services research where technology has an important role to play in resolving current issues, (ii) to review recent developments in basic research, research methodologies and emerging technologies and assess how multi-disciplinary approaches can provide suitable and ef-fective solutions to previously identified challenges, (iii) to share experiences of practical development of en-terprise biomedical systems and pragmatic implementations within national health systems, and finally, (iv) to assess the effectiveness of these implementations and review the impacts on key stakeholders.

MIXHS 2012 follows on and builds upon the success of the first MIXHS workshop, held in conjunction with the 20th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowl-edge Management in Glasgow in October 2011[1]. Our work-shop attracted submissions from the U.S, the U.K, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and Brazil. The elec-tronic proceedings of MIXHS X 11 are available on the ACM Digital Library 1 . The level of interest and engagement gen-erated by MIXHS is a clear sign that the themes and topics covered in the workshop are addressing important imple-mentations challenges of modern and future enterprise and national electronic health systems.

There is currently a pressing need for making a tight connection between emerging information technologies and health care applications. The Health Information Technol-ogy for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), for example, is intended to  X  X romote the widespread adoption of health information technology (HIT) to support the elec-tronic sharing of clinical data among hospitals, physicians, and other health care stakeholders X  [2]. The US National Research Council Committee on Engaging the Computer Science Research Community in Health Care Informatics, as another example, has been organized to conduct studies on the engagement of computer science research community in meeting challenges in health care information technology. Its goal is to identify  X  X ow current computer science-based methodologies and approaches can be applied more effectively h ttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2064747 to health care, and to explicate how the limitations in these methodologies and approaches might be overcome through ad-ditional research and development X  [3].
The aims of MIXHS are to (1) create synergies between computer scientists and clinical informatics researchers to apply emerging methodologies and technologies to complex biomedical and healthcare data and systems, and (2) to identify future directions to overcome long-term challenges in biomedical and healthcare IT. These research fields are of significant importance, with the potential to impact quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care delivery systems. Targeting these two aims, the workshop includes two tracks: Full Research Paper Track and Challenges and Visions Track.

All submissions were reviewed by an average of 3 reviewers and the program chairs wrote detailed meta-reviews for each submission summarising the comments of the members of the International Technical Program Committee.
