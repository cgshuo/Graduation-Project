 priority criteria. 3.1. Problem representation
The presented multi-criteria decision making approaches have the following components: the set C of the n considered criteria: C ={ C 1 , ... , C uating the i th criterion; the collection of documents D ; an aggregation function F to calculate for each document d 2 D a score F ( C uation scores of the considered criteria.
 criterion, which is taken into account in the RSV computation.

Let us assume that the C 1 , C 2 , ... , C n considered criteria have been ordered by the user in the sequence C
C j 1 (except the case of criterion C 0 1 , to which the importance weight 1 is assigned).
We denote by k i 2 [0,1] the importance weight associated with criterion C importance weights for the same document for different users.
 criteria we denote by C 1 the most preferred criterion, by C list), and we assume that C i is preferred to C j ( C i C
The above intuition may be formalized as follows: for each document d , the weight of the most important criterion C the weights of the other criteria C i , i 2 [2, n ], are calculated as follows: where C i 1 ( d ) is the degree of satisfaction of criterion C 3.2. The prioritized scoring model
Operator F s is defined as follow: F s :[0,1] n ? [0, n ] and it is such that, for a given document d , The RSV s of the document d is then given by: where C i  X  X  represent the considered relevance dimensions.

Let us come back to the introductory example. C 1 = Safety and C degree of 0.6 and an  X  X  X nexpensiveness X  X  degree of 0 would have an RSV
RSV
RSV s of (1 0) + (0 1) = 0.

Let us consider two further simple examples with four criteria (i.e., n = 4): C tant criterion and C 4 is the less important criterion. If document d
C ( d i ) = 1, we have: k 1 =1; k 2 = k 1 C 1 ( d i ) = 0.6; k 3 = k 2 C 2 ( d i ) = 0.48; k 4 = k 3 C 3 ( d i ) = 0.432; and the RSV s is then:
Instead, if we exchange the satisfaction degrees of C 2 and C k 1 =1; k 2 = k 1 C 1 ( d i ) = 0.6; k 3 = k 2 C 2 ( d i ) = 0.54; k 4 = k 3 C 3 ( d i ) = 0.432; and the RSV s is then: ond more important criterion is in the first example. 3.2.1. Properties of the prioritized  X  X  X coring X  X  operator
Here, we present some mathematical properties of the prioritized  X  X  X coring X  X  operator. 3.2.1.1. Continuity. The proposed aggregation is a polynomial; therefore, the property of continuity holds. 3.2.1.2. Boundary conditions. The  X  X  X coring X  X  operator satisfies: if " iC i ( d ) = 0 then P n i  X  1 k i C i  X  d  X  X  0; if " iC i ( d ) = 1 then P n i  X  1 k i C i  X  d  X  X  n ; " i 2 {1, ... , n } we have 0 6 and let us consider the two sets of criteria { C 1 ( d ), C C 0 i  X  d  X  X  C i  X  d  X  , " i  X  j , C 0 j  X  d  X  P C j  X  d  X  .
 We have than k 0 j  X  C 0 1  X  d  X  C 0 2  X  d  X  ... C 0 j 1  X  k j (see Eq. (1) ), and C 8 k &gt; j k 0 k P k k (by construction, see Eq. (1) ) and then k 3.2.1.4. Absorbing element. The  X  X  X coring X  X  operator has an absorbing element : C with k i = C 1 ( d ) C 2 ( d ) ... C i 1 ( d )=0, " i &gt;2.
 all, i.e., C k ( d ) = 0, then we have 3.3. The prioritized  X  X  X nd X  X  operator also the least important one, the overall satisfaction degree will be greater than C isfaction degree.

The aggregation operator F a is defined as follows. F a : [0,1]
The RSV a of the document d is then given by: RSV a ( d )= F where the C i  X  X  represent the satisfaction degrees of the considered relevance dimensions.
Let us come back again to the introductory example. C 1 = safety and C a  X  X  X afety X  X  degree of 1 and a  X  X  X nexpensiveness X  X  degree of 0 would have an RSV RSV a of min (0.9 1 ,0.8 0.9 ) = 0.818.

Let us consider two further examples with four criteria C
C is the less important criterion. If document d i is such that C k 1 =1; k 2 = k 1 C 1 ( d i ) = 0.9; k 3 = k 2 C 2 ( d i ) = 0.63; k 4 = k 3 C 3 ( d i ) = 0.567; and the overall score would then be: Instead, if
C 2 ( d i ) = 0.9, C 3 ( d i ) = 0.7, we would have: k 1 =1; k 2 = k 1 C 1 ( d i ) = 0.9; k 3 = k 2 C 2 ( d i ) = 0.81; k 4 = k 3 C 3 ( d i ) = 0.567; and the overall score case than the second more important criterion in the former case. 3.3.1. Properties of the prioritized  X  X  X nd X  X  aggregation operator
Here, we present some mathematical properties of the prioritized  X  X  X nd X  X  operator. 3.3.1.1. Continuity. The proposed aggregation is a polynomial, as it can be written as which is continuous, because, 8 x ; y 2 R ; min  X  x ; y  X  X  3.3.1.2. Boundary conditions. The proposed  X  X  X nd X  X  operator satisfies: if " iC i ( d ) = 0, then min n i  X  1 k i C i  X  d  X  X  0; if " iC i ( d ) = 1, then min n i  X  1 k i C i  X  d  X  X  1; " i 2 {1, ... , n }, we have 0 6 min n i  X  1 k i C i  X  d  X  increases, the overall final aggregation value can decrease.

For example, if we have C 1 ( d ) = 0.7, C 2 ( d ) = 0.1, C we replace C 1 ( d ) by a greater value C 0 1  X  d  X  X  0 : 9, we obtain that min (0.9 ous value. 3.3.1.4. Absorbing element. The proposed operator has an absorbing element , C
C ( d ) = 0, we have and to the fact that lim k ? 0 x k =1. 3.3.1.5. Neutral element. The proposed operator has a neutral element , C
C ( d ) = 1, we have x 2 [0,1], we have If k 2 [0,1], we have x 6 x k 6 1 for all x 2 [0,1].
 aggregation oprators produces distinct and intuitive results.

Let us suppose that C 1 ( d ) = 0.9 and C 2 ( d ) = 0.2, with C ness X  X  criterion. The different scores associated with John 1 and John 2 are computed as follows. k John 1: RSV s = k 1 C 1 ( d )+ k 2 C 2 ( d ) = 0.9 + 0.18 = 1.08; John 2: RSV a = min (0.9 1 ,0.18 0.9 ) = 0.213.
