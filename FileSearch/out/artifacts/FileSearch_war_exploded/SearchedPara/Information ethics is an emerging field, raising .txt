Information ethics is an emerging field, raising novel and complex problems as new technologies make more information from databases, e-mail correspondence, searches, and surveillance widely available, eroding privacy and an individual  X  s ability to control information about oneself and others  X  access to it. Different readers will find certain articles and sections more or less relevant to their work, and might have made dif-ferent choices about selections to include. Nevertheless, this anthology provides an excellent range of provoc-ative articles on multiple and varied topics. It reviews important background on ethics, privacy and free speech. The book also highlights the many unresolved moral and legal problems concerning intellectual prop-erty and ownership, genetic data and surveillance and information control, conflicts between free speech and privacy, and the erosion of privacy and civil liberties through e-mail monitoring and searches and surveillance justified for government agencies through Carnivore and the USA Patriot Act provisions. The importance of these current topics, and the diverse points of view represented, should help the book get the wide attention it deserves.

Richard Rogers, Information Politics on the Web, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2004, 216 pp., ISBN: 0-262-18242-4
Information Politics on the Web , by Richard Rogers, is both an  X  X  X xpose of the politics of information de-vices X  X  and a call for new practices of source inclusion and information adjudication that will help increase the inclusivity, fairness and scope of representation in electronically mediated politics. Rogers argues that a com-bination of exclusivity and closed logics in key information portals, such as Google, privilege entrenched polit-ical actors and official sources, reinforcing traditional hierarchies at the expense of alternative accounts of political reality. For example, a search for  X  X  X errorism X  X  in Google yields  X  X  X he White House, the CIA, the
FBI, the Heritage Foundation, a smattering of strategic studies groups at Universities, CNN, and Al Jazeera X  X  within the top twenty listings. These results provide an indication that the Web is becoming increasingly dom-inated by what Manual Castells refers to as  X  X  X nformational politics, X  X  where governments and political parties act not through traditional government X  X itizen exchanges but through mediated forums such as newspapers, broadcasting media and the Internet. 1 Although cyberspace may be seen as opening opportunities for political representation, this outcome is by no means guaranteed.

To counter these anti-democratic trends, Rogers introduces instruments designed specifically to flatten the hierarchies of political voice and move the processes of information adjudication back into the public sphere X  from the back-end politics of paid search engine placement, for example, to the front end politics of transpar-ent (but not necessarily inclusive) information tools.

By creating instruments that can illuminate the Web  X  s  X  X  X mbedded information X  X  (that information gener-ated online and not simply repurposed from offline sources) and the  X  X  X djudicative cultural processes X  X  that drive its evolution, Rogers hopes to open a new space for informational politics, a space where formally dis-enfranchised actors may have a voice  X  X  X ide by side X  X  with more mainstream political actors. The book will likely be of interest to a wide range of readers: social scientists looking for new approaches to Internet re-search, activists frustrated with the obstacles of traditional information politics, politicians and policy makers interested in the democratic potential of new media, and even artists striving to provide new windows into the dynamics of reality construction in new electronic social spaces.

Rogers details four instruments in the book: the lay decision support system, the Web issue index, the issue barometer and the election issue tracker. Each tool will likely appeal to different sectors of the reading audience.

The  X  X  X ay decision support system X  X  playfully and artistically exposes the collision of official and unofficial accounts of Viagra as they appear in Web space. This  X  X  X iagra tool X  X  leverages the relative flatness of the open
Web to highlight the many (occasionally illicit) uses of this Pfizer drug that one is unlikely to see in a promo-tional brochure or even the evening news. Rogers argues that the emergence of Viagra culture is more effec-tively mirrored by, and thus observable in, the information dynamic of Web media. While the overall point that the Web harbors important points of view and clusters of information we are unlikely to encounter through official channels or corporate media is clearly established, the instrument itself offers few insights into new instrument design for researchers. 2
The  X  X  X ssue index X  X  and its extension in the  X  X  X lection issue tracker X  X  are likely to be of interest to the politi-cian, activist, and researcher alike as they provide new measures of issue prominence within the space of civil society organizations and a way of mapping the flows of attention to political issues between political orga-nizations, the press and NGOs.

Of particular interest to communication scholars and social scientists is the issue barometer, a concrescence of major innovations turning formerly opaque data embedded in the Web to transparent indicators of key players in political issue networks and their interrelations, as well as the  X  X  X eat, X  X   X  X  X ntensity X  X  and  X  X  X erritorial-ization X  X  of the issues they debate, that is sure to stimulate even the most jaded of researchers. The heat or temperature of a debate is inferred from the relative number of times content has been refreshed on Web pages within the network. Intensity is determined via the number of actors in the network who, on the basis of tex-tual analysis, take a position on the issue. Finally, the territorialization of the debate is determined by the rel-ative number of countries represented in the actor domains that comprise the issue network. While there are certainly methodological issues related to each of the component measures of the barometer, the barometer concept itself represents one of the first serious attempts to establish a dynamic measure of political issue de-bates on the Web. As such, the tool is an excellent start.

While the book provides a wealth of insight into the development of instruments for researching the sociol-ogy of the Web, I found Rogers  X  decision to include four tools instead of focusing on one or two a bit frustrat-ing. The most methodologically rigorous and potentially useful of these tools, the Issue Crawler software, which maps issue networks for the Web barometer, is given short shrift. This network mapping software, which Rog-ers has generously made available to the global research community, has helped to drive an increase in interest in the sociological study of the Web graph. A full chapter at least covering methodological and validity issues would have added to the value of the instrument and this book. Further, though the book deals with the polit-ical implications of different structures of classification, it ignores some of the more controversial and interest-ing issues surrounding information ontology. Rogers points out how Web-based information instruments might serve to enhance the public sphere by  X  X  X lattening the hierarchies of credibility, X  X  but ignores the growing debate over emerging open and inclusive, organic ontologies employed by popular social bookmarking tools, a movement increasingly referred to as  X  X  X olksonomy. X  X  To be fair, Information Politics on the Web is a 2004 edi-tion and social categorization only a recent Web phenomenon.

The above criticisms aside, this book is highly recommended for anyone struggling with the challenges of researching patterns of social interaction and expression on the Internet. Rogers  X  attempts to develop new instruments of measurement should be of immediate benefit to political activists and strategists of all types.
For more mainstream academic researchers, however, most of these tools are too early stage to satisfy reliabil-ity and validity requirements met by more established methods such as traditional ethnography, survey re-search and content analysis. Nevertheless, the tools embody an innovative analytical approach with tremendous promise that interested researchers will be able to carry forward in the years to come. For this reason, I find Information Politics on the Web an invaluable resource.
