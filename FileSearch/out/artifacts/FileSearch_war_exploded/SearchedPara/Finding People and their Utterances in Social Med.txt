 H.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Theory, Experimentation, Measurement Social media, information retrieval Since its introduction, social media,  X  X  group of internet-based ap-plications that (...) allow the creation and exchange of user gen-erated content X  [ 1], has attracted more and more users. Over the years, many platforms have arisen that allow users to publish in-formation, communicate with others, connect to like-minded, and share anything a users wants to sh are. Text-centric examples are mailing lists, forums, blogs, community question answering, col-laborative knowledge sources, social networks, and microblogs, with new platforms starting all the time. Given the volume of in-formation available in social media, ways of accessing this infor-mation intelligently are needed; this is the scope of my research.
Why should we care about information in social media? Here are three examples that motivate my interest. (A) Viewpoint re-search; someone wants to take note of the viewpoints on a partic-ular issue. (B) Answers to problems; many problems have been encountered before, and people have shared solutions. (C) Product development; gaining insight into how people use a product and what features they wish for, eases the development of new prod-ucts. Looking at these examples of information need in social me-dia, we observe that they revolve not just around relevance in the traditional sense (i.e., objects relevant to a given topic), but also around criteria like credibility, author ity, viewpoints, expertise, and experiences. However, these additional aspects are typically condi-tioned on the topical relevance of information objects.

In social media,  X  X nformation objects X  come in several types but many are utterances created by people (blog posts, emails, ques-tions, answers, tweets). People and their utterances offer two nat-ural entry points to information contained in social media: utter-ances that are relevant and people that are of interest .Ifocuson three tasks in which the interaction between the two is key.
The first task concerns finding utterances in social media. Al-though this resembles a traditional ad hoc retrieval task, the lack of top-down rules and editors in social media entails the use of un-expected language: spelling and grammar errors are not corrected, and the vocabulary is unrestricted, unlike edited content. In my re-search, I use two features of social media to overcome the problem of unexpected language: (i) I translate several credibility indicators to measurable features, and implement these in the blog post re-trieval process to enhance retrieval effectiveness [ 2]; (ii) Utterances are surrounded by their environment, and this influences their con-tent. I use this observation to introduce a model for query modeling using external collections [ 5], and investigate which context levels are useful in email retrieval [ 4].

The second task, finding people in social media, is operational-ized in blog feed search : identify blogs that show a recurring inter-est in a given topic. This task shows similarities with expert finding, and models from this field have been successfully adopted. Blog-based models build and rank representations of bloggers based on their utterances, whereas post-based models rank utterances and ag-gregate scores to construct a ranking of bloggers. The former cap-ture the centrality of the topic to the blog, but are not very efficient; the latter can identify interesting posts and are efficient. In [ 6, 7] I introduce a two-stage model that ranks utterances and constructs models for the blogs these utterances belong to and ranks these blog models. My two-stage model is more efficient than blog-based models, and more effective than post-based models.

The third and final task builds on the previous two, and focuses on finding utterances using people . Applied to search in email archives, personal profiles can be constructed from people X  X  utter-ances. On top of these personal profiles, communication profiles are built, containing informatio n extracted from t hreads, quotes and replies as well as linguistic clues. Communication profiles can in-dicate the role of people in a topic-dependent way. For a given topic, I use both communication and personal profiles of people to find utterances that are relevant to the topic [ 3].
