 Abstract This paper presents an empirical evaluation of coreference resolution that covers several interrelated dimensions. The main goal is to complete the comparative analysis from the SemEval-2010 task on Coreference Resolution in Multiple Languages . To do so, the study restricts the number of languages and systems involved, but extends and deepens the analysis of the system outputs, including a more qualitative discussion. The paper compares three automatic coreference resolution systems for three languages (English, Catalan and Spanish) in four evaluation settings, and using four evaluation measures. Given that our main goal is not to provide a comparison between resolution algorithms, these are merely used as tools to shed light on the different conditions under which coreference resolution is evaluated. Although the dimensions are strongly interdependent, making it very difficult to extract general principles, the study reveals a series of interesting issues in relation to coreference resolution: the portability of systems across languages, the influence of the type and quality of input annotations, and the behavior of the scoring measures.
 Keywords Coreference resolution and evaluation NLP system analysis Machine learning based NLP tools SemEval-2010 (Task 1) Discourse entities 1 Introduction Coreference resolution is the problem of identifying the expressions (usually NPs) in a text that refer to the same discourse entity. Despite the extensive work on this topic over the last years, it is still a highly challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Given a text like (1), the coreference community aims to build systems that automatically output  X  X  X ajor League Baseball, X  X   X  X  X ts, X  X  and  X  X  X he league X  X  as mentions of the same entity,  X  X  X ts head of security X  X  as a mention of a separate entity, and so forth. (1) Major League Baseball sent its head of security to Chicago to review the A discourse entity (henceforth, entity) is defined as the collection of textual references to the same object in the discourse model, and each of these textual references is called a mention . Mentions of the same entity are said to corefer , whereas an entity that has one single mention is called a singleton . The terms  X  X  X oreference X  X  and  X  X  X naphora X  X  are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are not always the same. A coreferent expression is only anaphoric if its interpretation depends on a previous expression in the text (i.e., its antecedent ). In (1) above, its and the league are anaphoric, as the reader goes back in the text to find their antecedent. In contrast, a further mention of Major League Baseball using a lexical repetition would be coreferent but not anaphoric, as it could stand on its own.
We, as language users, can quickly and unconsciously work out the reference of every linguistic expression, linking the information provided by those that refer to the same entity. Resolving these dependencies is necessary for discourse compre-hension, and thus for NLP. However, the underlying process of how this is done is yet unclear, which makes the task of coreference resolution a real challenge. The mere task of producing the same results as those produced by humans is difficult and largely unsolved. There is nonetheless a strong interest in automatically identifying coreference links as they are needed by information extraction to merge different pieces of information referring to the same entity (McCarthy and Lehnert 1995 ), by text summarization to produce a coherent and fluent summary (Azzam et al. 1999 ; Steinberger et al. 2007 ), by question answering to disambiguate references along a document (Morton 1999 ; Vicedo and Ferra  X  ndez 2006 ), and by machine translation to translate pronouns correctly. Recently, state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems have been helpful for sentiment analysis (Nicolov et al. 2008 ), textual entailment (Mirkin et al. 2010 ; Abad et al. 2010 ), citation matching and databases (Wick et al. 2009 ), machine reading (Poon et al. 2010 ), for learning narrative schemas (Chambers and Jurafsky 2008 ), and for recovering implicit arguments (Gerber and Chai 2010 ; Ruppenhofer et al. 2010 ).

There have been a few evaluation campaigns on coreference resolution in the past, namely MUC (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997 ), ACE (Doddington et al. 2004 ), and ARE (Orasan et al. 2008 ). More recently, a task on Multilingual Coreference Resolution was organized at the SemEval-2010 evaluation exercise (Recasens et al. 2010 ). The goal of this task was to evaluate and compare automatic coreference resolution systems for six different languages in four evaluation settings and using four different evaluation measures. This complex scenario aimed at providing insight into several aspects of coreference resolution, including portability across languages, relevance of linguistic information at different levels, and behavior of alternative scoring measures. The task attracted considerable attention from a number of researchers, but only six teams submitted results. Moreover, participating systems did not run their systems for all the languages and evaluation settings, thus making direct comparisons among all the involved dimensions very difficult.

As discussed in the task description paper and slides, 1 the task contributed to the coreference community with valuable resources, evaluation benchmarks, and results along several dimensions. However, some problems were also identified and discussed. These were mainly related to the high complexity of the task, the limited number of participants, and a wrong design decision that did not allow a fair comparison between the settings using gold-standard input information and those using automatically predicted input information.
 The current study shares the same fundamental motivations as SemEval-2010 Task 1, but places greater emphasis on analyzing the different conditions under which coreference resolution is evaluated rather than comparing different resolution algorithms. We provide a more thorough empirical analysis overcoming the aforementioned problems in the definition of the task. More precisely, greater insight is provided into: (1) coreference annotations across corpora and languages, (2) the evaluation measures and their different focus on assessing the quality of a system output, and (3) a qualitative analysis of the results, including commented examples.

To conduct such an in-depth analysis and keep every piece under control, some simplifications with respect to SemEval-2010 Task 1 were necessary. More specifically, we reduced the number of languages from six to three (English, Spanish, and Catalan), and we did not maintain the distinction between closed and open scenarios. Since this meant reevaluating the systems, we additionally restricted the comparison to three coreference resolution systems. Two of them, C ISTELL and R
ELAX C OR , are in-house systems. The third one, R ECONCILE , is freely available as open-source software.

With the aim of promoting continued research on this problem and the use of our data sets by the coreference community, we have made available all the corpora used in this study (i.e., the SemEval-2010 corpora updated with a few additional annotations), the scoring software upgraded with some new functionalities, and the system outputs of the different evaluation scenarios. For the latter we provide not only the regular textual representation, but also an HTML representation that can be viewed in any browser and where colors and meta-annotations facilitate the interpretation and comparison of the coreference annotations made by the three systems. 2 This is an additional contribution of this work, and it can also be used to reproduce the results reported here.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the corpora used in this study, together with some statistics and an analysis of their main properties. Section 3 describes the three automatic systems for coreference resolution that are used in the study. Section 4 is devoted to the experimental setting, with a special emphasis on the evaluation measures. Section 5 provides the numerical results of the baselines and systems across languages and settings. In Sect. 6 , a deeper analysis of the system outputs is performed by focusing on more qualitative aspects and discussing specific examples. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes and identifies key issues for future research. 2 Corpora and coreference annotation The corpora used in this study comprise the English, Catalan, and Spanish data sets from the SemEval-2010 Task 1 on Multilingual Coreference Resolution. These corpora are excerpts from the OntoNotes Release 2.0 (Pradhan et al. 2007 ) and AnCora corpora (Recasens and Mart X   X  2010 ). They contain coreference annotations of entities composed of pronouns and full noun phrases (including named entities), plus several annotation layers of syntactic and semantic information: lemma, part-of-speech, morphological features, dependency parsing, named entities, predicates, and semantic roles. Most of these annotation layers are doubly provided, once as gold standard and once as predicted , i.e., manually annotated versus predicted by automatic linguistic analyzers. The coreference annotation also includes the entities consisting of a single mention (singletons). For more information on these corpora, including formatting details and the linguistic processors used to produce the predicted layers of information, we refer the reader to the task description paper and website (Recasens et al. 2010 ).

The corpora of the three languages are divided into training, development and test sets following the same partitions as SemEval-2010 Task 1. The development corpora were used for parameter tuning. All the results reported in Sects. 4 , 5 and 6 were obtained on the test sets. Table 1 summarizes the number of documents (#docs), sentences (#sents), and tokens in the training, development and test sets. As can be seen, the Catalan and Spanish corpora are comparable in size, although the latter is slightly larger, while the English corpus is significantly smaller (about 30 % of the total number of tokens).

Table 2 presents general statistics on the coreference annotation of the three corpora, which give a first impression of the similarities and differences between the languages. The first two blocks of rows show the absolute number (also averaged per document) of tokens, entities, mentions, and singletons. 3 It can be observed that the concentration of entities per document is larger in English, with an average of 68 entities per document, as opposed to 51 and 55 entities per document in Catalan and Spanish, respectively. This difference is largely explained by the high number of singleton entities in English, which represent * 86 % of the entities and * 63 % of the mentions. The same figures for Catalan and Spanish are about 15 and 10 points below, respectively.

The average entity size (in number of mentions) of the three languages is quite comparable if singletons are not taken into account. Unlike AnCora, where non-referential NPs like nominal predicates were filtered out, the OntoNotes corpus was only annotated with multi-mention entities. To make all the data sets as similar as possible for the SemEval shared task, singletons were identified heuristically in the English data set, although a few non-referential NPs that could not be automatically detected were unavoidably annotated as singletons. This accounts for the larger number of singletons in English. The bar chart in Fig. 1 compares the distribution of non-singleton entities according to entity size across the three languages. Remarkably, most of the cases (&gt;50 % of the total number of entities) fall into entities of size two. The distribution is very similar for all the languages. Catalan and Spanish show an almost identical distribution. English contains a slightly smaller number of entities of size two, but a slightly larger number of entities of size three (the variation is around five percent points).

The last two blocks of rows in Table 2 analyze how far apart coreferent mentions are from one another. To this end, we calculated the average distance to the preceding coreferent mention, and then averaged it on the entire corpus. 4 Three measurements of this distance were calculated by counting the number of word tokens (#tok), sentence boundaries (#sent), and mentions (#ment) in between two coreferent mentions. Additionally, this comparison was also measured in terms of decayed density (Daume  X  and Marcu 2005 ). This measure was designed to capture the fact that some entities are referred to consistently across a document, while others are mentioned in only one short segment. This is a density measure, so it should correlate negatively with the distance-based measures. A clear picture emerges from this comparison: the English corpus contains a smaller number of dense entities, with mentions spread across longer distances on average and with more intervening mentions. Catalan and Spanish follow in this order. The fact that relative pronouns are annotated in the Catalan and Spanish data, but not in the English data, helps to account for the smaller distance between mentions observed in the first two languages.

We also carried out a more detailed study of the coreference relations in the three corpora. We grouped mentions into meaningful classes according to their morphology and their relation with the other mentions in the same coreference chain. The list of classes is described in Table 3 . They follow the ideas from Stoyanov et al. ( 2009 ), but are adapted to our setting and languages. Given that Catalan and Spanish pronouns are always gendered, the P_3 U class makes no sense for them. In the case of English, we omit the P_ ELL and P_ REL classes as it is not a pro-drop language, and relative pronouns are not coreferentially annotated in the English data set. Note that the same mention classes are used again in Sect. 6 to compute detailed results of the three coreference resolution systems.

Table 4 shows the number and percentage of each mention class for the three corpora. As can be seen, Catalan and Spanish present again a very similar distribution. When English is compared to the two Romance languages, we clearly observe that English has a higher number of PN_ E coreference relations, but a lower number of CN_ N . This can be accounted for by the same reason pointed out by Lundquist ( 2007 ) for Danish (of the same language family as English) and French (of the same language family as Catalan and Spanish). She observes a preference in French for unfaithful anaphors (that is, coreferent NPs whose head is different from that of the previous NP in the chain) that contrasts with the preference in Danish for faithful anaphors (that is, coreferent NPs that are pronouns or that repeat the previous coreferent NP). She attributes this difference to the different lexicalization patterns of Romance and Germanic languages. The former tend to lexicalize nouns at a more concrete and subordinate level, whereas the latter lexicalize more semantic features in verbs. As a result, Romance languages are said to be exocentric because they distribute the information onto the noun, and Germanic languages are said to be endocentric because they concentrate the information in the verb.
Also, if we assume that coreferent mentions that match exactly (i.e., PN_ E and CN_ E ) are generally easier to resolve than non-matching mentions (PN_ N and CN_ N ), we find that English shows a more favorable proportion of  X  X  X asy X  X  and  X  X  X ifficult X  X  non-pronominal mention classes (25.46 X 24.97 %) as compared to Catalan (23.21 X 28.11 %) and Spanish (22.55 X 29.6 %). This could certainly influence the relative performance across languages achieved by coreference resolution systems. In regard to pronouns, the small numbers of P_1 [ 2 and P_3 G in Catalan and Spanish are counterbalanced by the large number of P_ ELL , but English still has more pronouns altogether ( * 37 vs. * 22 % in the two Romance languages, excluding relative pronouns). The  X  X  X mptiness X  X  of elliptical subjects adds to the difficulty of resolving coreference for Catalan and Spanish. 5 3 Coreference systems This section introduces the three coreference systems that were used in the study. They represent the main classes of supervised learning coreference systems according to the classification model, and to the way the classification and linking steps are integrated. Classification models mainly fall into mention-pair and entity-mention models (Ng 2010 ). The former classify every pair of mentions as coreferent or not. This is the model followed by R ECONCILE and R ELAX C OR . The latter models, used by C ISTELL , define an entity as a bag of (ordered) mentions and extract a set of properties defining the whole entity, then classification is done by comparing mentions with entities. In terms of integrating classification and linking, a distinction can be drawn between two-step and one-step models. R ECONCILE is a two-step system because it first classifies all the mention pairs, and then links the mentions to entities. In contrast, C ISTELL and R ELAX C OR are one-step systems because they collapse classification and linking into a single step.

In terms of features, the three systems use a similar feature set that captures the information classically used by coreference systems: textual strings (e.g., head match, substring match, distance), morphology (e.g., NP type, gender, number), syntax (e.g., grammatical function), and semantics (e.g., NE type, synonymy/ hypernymy relations in WordNet). The difference in the size of the feature set, ranging from the 30 features used by C ISTELL to the over 100 features used by R
ELAX C OR , generally stems from different choices in terms of binary or multi-valued features, rather than different kinds of information.

Table 5 reports the main properties and configurations of the three systems used in our study. The reader will find a detailed description of the aspects included in the table in the following Sects. 3.1 , 3.2 and 3.3 , respectively devoted to C ISTELL , R The approach taken in devising the C ISTELL coreference system (Recasens 2010 ) adds to the body of work on entity-mention models. These models are meant to determine not the probability that a mention corefers with a previous mention, but the probability that a mention refers to a previous entity, i.e., a set of mentions already classified as coreferent. Luo et al. ( 2004 ) pioneered this line of research, and concluded that it is  X  X  X n area that needs further research. X  X  C ISTELL is based on the belief that keeping track of the history of each discourse entity is helpful to capture the largest amount of information about an entity provided by the text, and to this end it handles discourse entities as (growing) baskets. 6 The notion of a growing basket is akin to Heim X  X  ( 1983 ) file card in file change semantics, where a file card stands for each discourse entity so that the information of subsequent references can be stored in it as the discourse progresses.

After identifying the set of mentions, C ISTELL allocates to each mention a basket that contains mention attributes such as head, gender, number, part-of-speech, NE type, modifiers, grammatical role, synonyms, hypernyms, sentence position, etc. The convenient property of baskets is that they can grow by swallowing other baskets and incorporating their attributes. When two baskets are classified as coreferent, they are immediately clustered into a growing basket (which can grow further). The general resolution process is inspired by Popescu-Belis et al. ( 1998 ).
C ISTELL follows the learning-based coreference architecture in which the task is split into classification and linking (Soon et al. 2001 ), but combines them simultaneously. A pairwise classifier that predicts the probability of two mentions coreferring is trained with the TiMBL memory-based learning software package (Daelemans et al. 1999 ). It is jointly trained for coreference resolution and discourse-new detection. This is achieved by generating negative training instances that, unlike Soon et al. ( 2001 ), include not only coreferent mentions but also singletons. The 30 learning features that were used in this study for English, and the 32 learning features that were used for Catalan and Spanish, are a subset of those described in Recasens and Hovy ( 2009 ). Separate classifiers were trained for each of the evaluation scenarios, depending on whether the annotation was gold-standard or predicted, and whether true or system mentions were used.

Linking is identified with basket growing, the core process, that calls the pairwise classifier every time it considers whether a basket must be clustered into a (growing) basket. When the two baskets are singletons, they are linked if they are classified as coreferent by the classifier. Otherwise, the basket under analysis is paired with each of the baskets contained within the larger basket, and it is only linked if all the pairs are classified as coreferent. This is how the strong match model behaves, which turned out to obtain the best results among all the evaluated techniques for basket growing. R
ELAX C OR (Sapena et al. 2010a ) is a coreference resolution system based on constraint satisfaction. It represents the problem as a graph connecting any pair of candidate coreferent mentions, and it applies relaxation labeling over a set of constraints to decide the set of most compatible coreference relations. This approach combines classification and linking in one step. Thus, decisions are taken considering the entire set of mentions, which ensures consistency and avoids local classification decisions.

The knowledge of the system is a set of weighted constraints. Each constraint has an associated weight reflecting its confidence. The sign of the weight indicates whether a pair or group of mentions corefer (positive) or not (negative). Only constraints over pairs of mentions were used in the current version. However, R
ELAX C OR can handle higher-order constraints. Constraints can be obtained from any source, including a training data set from which they can be manually or automatically acquired. For the present study, all constraints were learned automatically using more than a hundred features over the mention pairs in the training sets. The typical attributes were used, like those in Sapena et al. ( 2010b ), but binarized for each possible value. In addition, other features that could help, such as whether a mention is an NE of location type or a possessive phrase, were included. A decision tree was generated from the training data set, and a set of constraints was extracted with the C4.5 rule-learning algorithm (Quinlan 1993 ). The so learned constraints are conjunctions of attribute-value pairs. The weight associated with each constraint is the constraint precision minus a balance value, which is determined using the development step.

The coreference resolution problem is represented as a graph with mentions in the vertices. Mentions are connected to each other by edges. Edges are assigned a weight that indicates the confidence that the mention pair corefers or not. More specifically, an edge weight is the sum of the weights of the constraints that apply to that mention pair. The larger the edge weight in absolute terms, the more reliable.
R ELAX C OR uses relaxation labeling for the resolution process. Relaxation labeling is an iterative algorithm that performs function optimization based on local information (Hummel and Zucker 1987 ). It has been widely used to solve NLP problems such as part of speech tagging (Padro  X  1998 ) and opinion mining (Popescu and Etzioni 2005 ). An array of probability values is maintained for each vertex/ mention. Each value corresponds to the probability that the mention belongs to a specific entity given all the possible entities in the document. During the resolution process, the probability arrays are updated according to the edge weights and probability arrays of the neighboring vertices. The larger the edge weight, the stronger the influence exerted by the neighboring probability array. The process stops when there are no more changes in the probability arrays or the maximum change does not exceed an epsilon parameter.

The R ELAX C OR implementation used in the present study is an improved version of the system that participated in the SemEval-2010 Task 1 (Sapena et al. 2010b ). The largest differences involve the training and development processes. The current R
ELAX C OR includes a parameter optimization process using the development data sets. The optimized parameters are balance and pruning . The former adjusts the constraint weights to improve the balance between precision and recall; the latter limits the number of neighbors that a vertex can have. Limiting the number of neighbors reduces the computational cost significantly and improves overall performance too. Optimizing this parameter depends on properties like document size and the quality of the information given by the constraints. Both parameters were empirically adjusted on the development set for the CEAF evaluation measure. 3.3 Reconcile In addition to C ISTELL and R ELAX C OR we decided to include a third system to gain a better insight into coreference resolution. There are only a few freely available coreference systems, such as BART (Versley et al. 2008 ), the Illinois Coreference Package (Bengtson and Roth 2008 ), Reconcile (Stoyanov et al. 2010 ), and OpenNLP. 7 Given that we wanted the three systems of our study to solve coreference using the same input information, we needed a system that accepted an already preprocessed document as input. After reviewing the different options, we chose R ECONCILE as it satisfied our needs with minimal effort. However, R ECONCILE , as well as the rest of publicly available systems, only works for English. Indeed, there seems to exist no language-independent coreference system.

The R ECONCILE system is different from C ISTELL and R ELAX C OR in that it is a platform meant as a research testbed that can be easily customized by the user to experiment with different coreference resolution architectures, learning algorithms, feature sets, data sets, and scoring measures. In this way, it facilitates consistent comparisons of different coreference resolution systems (for English). The structure of R ECONCILE is best described by the seven desiderata that guided its design: (1) to implement the basic architecture of state-of-the-art learning-based coreference resolution systems; (2) to support experimentation on the MUC and ACE data sets; (3) to implement the most popular coreference resolution scoring measures; (4) to create an end-to-end coreference resolver that achieves state-of-the-art performance (using its default configuration); (5) to make it easily extendable with new methods and features; (6) to make it relatively fast and easy to configure and run; (7) to include a set of pre-built resolvers that can be used as black-box coreference resolution systems.

The basic architecture of R ECONCILE includes five major steps. Firstly, it preprocesses the data using a sentence splitter, tokenizer, POS tagger, parser, NER, and NP detector. Secondly, it produces feature vectors for every NP pair, including over 80 features inspired by Soon et al. ( 2001 ) and Ng and Cardie ( 2002 ). Thirdly, it learns a classifier that assigns a score indicating the likelihood that a pair of NPs is coreferent. Fourthly, it employs clustering to form the final set of entities. Finally, it evaluates the output according to the MUC, B 3 , and CEAF scores. For the experiment reported in this paper, we discarded the first and final steps, and we used the default configuration, namely the Reconcile 2010 implementation, which includes a hand-selected subset of 60 features, an averaged perceptron classifier, and a single-link clustering with a positive decision threshold of 0.5.

Adapting the system to work in our experimental setting required only a minimal effort of format conversion at the input and output of the R ECONCILE module. In contrast, the effort necessary to port the system to Spanish and Catalan would have required substantial programming and extensive knowledge of the system imple-mentation. This is why we report R ECONCILE scores only for the English data set. 4 Experimental setup 4.1 Evaluation scenarios Four different evaluation scenarios are considered in this work, differing along two dimensions: (1) true versus system mentions, and (2) gold versus predicted input information. Combining these two dimensions yields four different settings, which allow us to study the differences of solving coreference relations under an ideal scenario versus a more realistic one, in which mention boundaries and all the input linguistic features have to be automatically predicted. 8
True mentions as well as gold and predicted morphosyntactic layers of annotation were already available in the SemEval-2010 Task 1 data sets (see Sect. 2 for more details), while system mentions were supposed to be generated by the participating systems. In this work, we implemented a simple mention detection procedure for supplying mentions so that the three coreference resolution systems use the same set of mentions in the system mention scenarios. System mentions are included as new annotation columns in the updated data sets released with this work.

The mention detection algorithm adds one mention for every noun and pronoun encountered in the text, except for multiple consecutive nouns (in this case, the mention is added for the last noun, a heuristic for identifying the syntactic head). Nouns and pronouns are detected by checking their part-of-speech tag. Mention boundaries are determined by looking at the dependency syntactic tree (either gold or predicted, depending on the setting) and selecting the complete segment of text that is covered by the noun or pronoun under analysis. That is, the rightmost (or leftmost) dependency modifying the noun is recursively followed to locate the right (or left) mention boundary. This simple mention detection algorithm can be considered as a baseline, but it performs reasonably well (especially for English), as reported in Sect. 5 . Typical errors made by the system mention extraction procedure include extracted NPs that are not referential (e.g., predicative and appositive phrases), mentions with incorrect boundaries, and mentions that are not correctly extracted in a sequence of nouns (due to the NP head heuristic). Obviously, the number of errors increases with predicted annotations. 4.2 Evaluation measures Automatic evaluation measures are crucial for coreference system development and comparison. Unfortunately, there is no agreement at present on a standard measure for coreference resolution evaluation. This is why we included the three measures most widely used to assess the quality of a coreference output X  X amely B 3 (Bagga and Baldwin 1998 ), CEAF (Luo 2005 ), and MUC (Vilain et al. 1995 ) X  X lus the recently developed BLANC (Recasens and Hovy 2011 ), to provide a more complete picture of the behavior of the different evaluation approaches. B 3 and CEAF are mention-based, whereas MUC and BLANC are link-based.

The following describes in more detail what each measure quantifies as well as its strengths and weaknesses. In evaluating the output produced by a coreference resolution system, we need to compare the true set of entities (the key or key partition , i.e., the manually annotated entities) with the predicted set of entities (the response or response partition , i.e., the entities output by a system). Entities are viewed as sets of mentions. The cardinality of an entity is the number of mentions it contains. The mentions in the key are known as true mentions , and the mentions in the response are known as system mentions . The MUC, B 3 and CEAF results are expressed in terms of precision (P), recall (R), and F 1 , which is defined as the harmonic mean between precision and recall as usual: F 1  X  2 P R =  X  P  X  R  X  . 4.2.1 The MUC scoring algorithm The MUC scoring algorithm was first introduced by the MUC-6 evaluation campaign in 1995. It operates by comparing the entities defined by the links in the key and the response. In short, it counts the least number of links that need to be inserted in or deleted from the response to transform its entities into those of the key. The resulting formula ( 1 ) takes the set of entities in the key (to compute recall) or in the response (to response (to compute recall) or to the key (to compute precision). For instance, for those entities in the response that overlap S i , including implicit singletons. Precision works the other way around and takes the response as S .

As observed by many (Bagga and Baldwin 1998 ; Luo 2005 ), the MUC measure taining wrong mentions: classifying one mention into a wrong entity counts as one precision and one recall error, while completely merging two entities counts as a single recall error. This can easily result in higher F-scores for worse systems. Finkel and Manning ( 2008 ) point out that if all the mentions in each document of the MUC test sets are linked to one single entity, the MUC measure gives a score higher than any published system. Second, given that it only takes into account coreference links, it ignores correct singleton entities. It is only when a singleton mention is incorrectly linked to another mention that precision decreases. For this reason, this measure is not a good choice when working with data sets that, unlike the MUC corpora (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997 ), are annotated with singletons. 4.2.2 B-CUBED (B 3 ) The B 3 measure was developed in response to the shortcomings of MUC. It shifts the attention from links to mentions by computing precision and recall for each mention, and then taking the weighted average of these individual precision and recall scores. For a mention m i , the individual precision represents how many mentions in the response entity of m i corefer. The individual recall represents how many mentions in the key entity of m i are output as coreferent. The formula for recall for a given mention m i is given in ( 2 ), and that for precision is given in ( 3 ), where R m i is the response entity of mention m i , and K m i is the key entity of mention m . Their cardinality is the number of mentions. The final precision and recall are computed by averaging these scores over all the mentions.

However, this measure has also been criticized. Luo ( 2005 ) considers that B 3 can give counterintuitive results due to the fact that an entity can be used more than once when computing the intersection of the key and response partitions. Besides, Re-casens and Hovy ( 2011 ) point out another weakness. When working with corpora where all entities are annotated and singletons appear in large numbers, scores rapidly approach 100 %. More seriously, outputting all the mentions as singletons obtains a score close to some state-of-the-art performances. 4.2.3 Constrained entity-alignment F-measure (CEAF) Luo ( 2005 ) proposed CEAF to solve the problem of reusing entities in B 3 .Itfindsthe best one-to-one mapping between the entities in the key and the response, i.e., each response entity is aligned with at most one key entity. The best alignment is the one maximizing the total entity similarity X  X enoted as U  X  g  X   X  and it is found by the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. Two similarity functions for comparing two entities are suggested, resulting in the mention-based CEAF and the entity-based CEAF that use ( 4 )and( 5 ), respectively, where K refers again to the key partition, and R to the response partition. We use the mention-based CEAF to score the experiments reported in this paper because it is the most widely used. It corresponds to the number of common mentions between every two aligned entities divided by the total number of men-tions. When the key and response have the same number of mentions, recall and precision are the same. On the basis of the best alignment, they are computed according to ( 6 ) and ( 7 ).
 Again, CEAF is not free of criticism. It suffers from the singleton problem just as B 3 does, which accounts for the fact that B 3 and CEAF usually get higher scores than MUC on corpora such as ACE where singletons are annotated, because a great percentage of the score is simply due to the resolution of singletons. In addition, the entity alignment of CEAF might cause a correct coreference link to be ignored if that entity finds no alignment in the key (Denis and Baldridge 2009 ). Finally, all entities are weighted equally, irrespective of the number of mentions they contain (Stoyanov et al. 2009 ), so that creating a wrong entity composed of two small entities is penalized to the same degree as creating a wrong entity composed of a small and a large entity. 4.2.4 BiLateral assessment of noun-phrase coreference (BLANC) The main motivation behind the BLANC measure is to take the imbalance of singleton vs. coreferent mentions into account. To this end, it returns to the idea of links, but with a fundamental difference with respect to MUC: it considers the two aspects of the problem, namely not only coreference links but also non-coreference links (i.e., those that hold between every two mentions that do not corefer). The sum of the two remains constant across the key and response. Although this is an idea that comes from the Rand index (Rand 1971 ), BLANC puts equal emphasis on each type of link by computing precision and recall separately for coreference and non-coreference links, and then averaging the two precision or recall scores for the final score. This is shown in ( 8 ) and ( 9 ), where rc are the number of right coreference links, wc are the number of wrong coreference links, rn are the number of right non-coreference links, and wn are the number of wrong non-coreference links. Finally, the BLANC score averages the F-score for coreference links and the F-score for non-coreference links.

Four simple variations are defined for those cases when either the key or the response partition contains only singletons or a single entity. Unlike B 3 and CEAF, a coreference resolution system has to get high precision and recall for both core-ference and non-coreference simultaneously to score well under BLANC. Although it is a very new measure and has not undergone extensive testing yet, its main weakness is revealed in the not very likely scenario of a document that consists of singletons except for one two-mention entity, as BLANC would penalize too severely a system that outputs all the mentions as singletons. 4.2.5 Evaluating on system mentions An issue that has been discussed by various authors (Bengtson and Roth 2008 ; Stoyanov et al. 2009 ; Rahman and Ng 2009 ; Cai and Strube 2010 ) is the assumption made by B 3 , CEAF and BLANC that the mention set in the key partition is the same as the mention set in the response partition. Arguably, end-to-end systems may output some mentions that do not map onto any true mention, or vice versa, some true mentions may not map onto any system mention. These are called twinless mentions by Stoyanov et al. ( 2009 ). To handle twinless mentions, the above measures have been implemented with minor tweaks.

Bengtson and Roth ( 2008 ) simply discard twinless mentions, while Stoyanov et al. ( 2009 ) suggest two variants of B 3 :B 3 0 and B 3 all. The former discards twinless system mentions and sets recall( m i ) = 0if m i is a twinless true mention; the latter retains twinless system mentions, and sets precision( m i ) = 1 j R twinless system mention, and recall( m i ) = 1 j K Another adjustment for both B 3 and CEAF is proposed by Rahman and Ng ( 2009 ): they remove only those twinless system mentions that are singletons, as they argue that in these cases the system should not be penalized for mentions that it has successfully identified as singletons. Recently, Cai and Strube ( 2010 ) have pointed out several outputs that are not properly evaluated by any of the above approaches. To deal with system mentions more successfully, they present two variants of B 3 and CEAF that (1) insert twinless true mentions into the response partition as singletons, (2) remove twinless system mentions that are resolved as singletons, and (3) insert twinless system mentions that are resolved as coreferent into the key partition (as singletons).

At a closer look, it appears that the two variants introduced by Cai and Strube ( 2010 ) can be regarded as adjustments of the key and response partitions rather than variants of the evaluation measures themselves. By adjusting the two partitions, each true mention can be aligned to a system mention, so that both the key and response partitions have the same number of mentions, and systems are neither unfairly favored nor unfairly penalized. We realized that the three adjustments by Cai and Strube ( 2010 ) for B 3 and CEAF make it possible to apply any coreference evaluation measure, and this is the approach followed in this paper to evaluate the system mentions 9 gold annotation and system mentions 9 predicted annotation scenarios. This new adjustment is a contribution that has been already incorporated into the scoring software. This software, which is distributed with the rest of materials of the paper, has also been adopted by the CoNLL-2011 shared task (Pradhan et al. 2011 ) as the official scorer. 4.2.6 Evaluating mention detection Performance on the task of mention detection alone is measured in Table 7 with recall, precision, and F 1 . System mentions are rewarded with 1 point if their boundaries coincide with those of the true mentions, with 0.5 points if their boundaries are within the true mention including its head, and with 0 otherwise. 5 Baseline and system results This section presents the results of the C ISTELL ,R ELAX C OR and R ECONCILE coreference resolution systems on the SemEval data. Before this, Tables 6 and 7 provide relevant information to interpret the results of the three systems. Table 6 shows the scores of two naive baselines together with oracle scores, and Table 7 shows the results of C ISTELL ,R ELAX C OR and R ECONCILE on the mention detection task.
 5.1 Baseline scores The two baselines reported in Table 6 represent the most straightforward outputs: (1) S INGLETONS does not create any coreference link, but considers each mention as a separate entity, and (2) A LL -IN -O NE groups all the document mentions into one single entity. The O RACLE represents the best results achievable given a particular mention detection setting. Obviously, 100 % for the four evaluation measures is only achievable when true mentions are used.

We only provide the S INGLETONS scores once for each language as using true mentions or system mentions does not make any difference in the final score if no coreference link is output. This is so, however, due to the adjustment of the outputs that we make inspired by Cai and Strube ( 2010 ). As explained above in Sect. 4.2 , twinless true mentions are inserted into the response partition as singletons, and singleton twinless system mentions are removed. This invariance is evidence that Cai and Strube X  X  ( 2010 ) adjustment makes it possible for the coreference resolution measures to strictly evaluate coreference resolution without being influenced by mention detection performance.

Surprisingly enough, the A LL -IN -O NE baseline using system mentions obtains higher scores than the one using true mentions according to CEAF, B 3 and BLANC in the three languages. The fact that only MUC behaves as initially expected hints at the most plausible explanation: the difference is due to singletons as well as to Cai and Strube X  X  ( 2010 ) adjustment for aligning true and system mentions. Unavoidably, a large number of true mentions are missing from the set of system mentions, but the adjustment inserts them into the response partition as singletons, thus they are not included into the same entity as all the mentions automatically detected. If we also keep in mind that the majority of mentions are singletons, especially long and syntactically complex NPs that are hard to detect automatically, twinless true mentions that escape from being included in the A LL -IN -O NE entity account for the increase in performance.

These simple baselines reveal limitations of the evaluation measures on the two extremes (see Sect. 4.2 ): CEAF and B 3 reward the naive S INGLETONS baseline too much, while MUC gives a too high score to the naive A LL -IN -O NE baseline. As a result, Table 6 also illustrates differences between the data sets. The English data set obtains the highest CEAF and B 3 scores for the S INGLETONS baseline, whereas the Catalan and Spanish data sets obtain the highest MUC scores for the A LL -IN -O NE baseline. This is easily accounted for by the slightly larger number of singletons in the English data (see Sect. 2 ). Because of the 50 % recall upper limit of BLANC, the S INGLETONS baseline scores considerably lower.
 The O RACLE agrees with our expectations, except for the very small difference in English in the performance using system mentions based on gold syntax with respect to that based on predicted syntax, as opposed to the seven-or eight-point difference observed in Catalan and Spanish. There are two reasons for this. First, the English parser performs better than the Catalan and Spanish counterparts. Wrong PoS tag or dependency relations are likely to have a negative effect on the quality of mention detection. As shown in Table 7 , the decrease in mention detection performance in Catalan and Spanish using predicted syntax is considerably larger than in English. Second, the smaller decrease in English may have to do with the fact that the mention detection architecture was originally designed for English and not particularly adapted for either Catalan/Spanish or the different data sets (see the description in Sect. 4.1 ). 5.2 Mention detection scores Table 7 shows that, even if the quality of the mention detection module is high, especially for English, it represents a drop of 12 points with respect to true mentions (from 100 to * 88 %), and a further drop of 8 points when detection is based on predicted instead of gold annotation (from * 88 to * 80 %). The results are between 10 and 15 points lower for Catalan and Spanish. These drops are not so sharp in the O
RACLE (Table 6 ) because of the singleton adjustment for mapping the response onto the key partition that inserts missing singletons. Although our initial goal was to have the three systems use the same set of true mentions and system mentions, Table 7 shows that, unlike R ELAX C OR and R ECONCILE ,C ISTELL did not reach 100 % in the true mentions 9 predicted annotation setting. Although true mentions were provided, C ISTELL is highly dependent on the syntactic tree as it requires mentions to coincide with a syntactic node, which is clearly not always the case when predicted annotations are used. 5.3 System scores Table 8 displays the results of C ISTELL and R ELAX C OR for English, Catalan, Spanish, and averaged results for the three languages, as well as the results of R ECONCILE for English, in the four evaluation settings and according to the four evaluation measures. Results are presented sequentially by language and setting. Unlike the corresponding table in the task description article of Proceedings of SemEval-2010 (Recasens et al. 2010 ), all the cells of Table 8 are filled except for the Catalan and Spanish results of R ECONCILE . We are then in a better position to compare coreference systems at multiple levels. This section presents the results from a quantitative point of view, while the next section tries to shed additional light on these results and provides some qualitative discussion. 5.3.1 Overall performances The best system appears to be R ELAX C OR , especially for English, while the measures disagree in ranking R ECONCILE and C ISTELL . The former is the second top system according to CEAF and B 3 , whereas the latter is according to MUC and BLANC. This disagreement is associated with the opposite tendencies of the two systems: they obtain similar F 1 scores, but R ECONCILE favors precision over recall, while the opposite is true for C ISTELL , as the examples in the next section illustrate. The limitations of the measures in relation to the baselines become apparent again (Table 6 ): although R ECONCILE and C ISTELL only slightly outperform the B 3 and CEAF results of the S INGLETONS baseline, and generally underperform the MUC classifying all the mentions as singletons, or linking them all under the same entity. 5.3.2 Languages In terms of language, the best results are obtained for English, followed by Spanish and Catalan (R ELAX C OR and C ISTELL come close to each other if we follow the BLANC ranking). Two factors account for this difference. First, the larger number of singletons observed in English, which boosts the B 3 and CEAF performance. Second, the system that actually shows the most dramatic decrease, R ELAX C OR , was originally designed with the English language in mind. As a result, it does not include language-specific features for Spanish and Catalan like whether a mention is or not an elliptical subject. The slightly worse performance in Catalan as compared with Spanish reflects the different composition summarized in Table 2 (Sect. 2 ). Despite the similarity between the two corpora, Catalan is expected to be harder given the higher distance between coreferent mentions and its lower decayed density. 5.3.3 Gold versus predicted, true versus system In terms of gold versus predicted annotation, and of true versus system mentions, it emerges that the largest drop in performance is observed for the link-based measures. Performance decreases by 5 X 6 MUC points in the case of R ELAX C OR and R
ECONCILE in English, but only by 2 points in the case of C ISTELL , while the decrease is hardly noticeably looking at B 3 . In Catalan and Spanish, the C ISTELL score decreases to a larger extent than that of R ELAX C OR when true mentions are used, but R
ELAX C OR experiences a very remarkable drop when system mentions are used. This is very likely due to the fact that R ELAX C OR was not separately trained on system mentions. The system was trained for each language, but not for each evaluation scenario due to the high computational cost of learning the constraints (the only scenario tuning occurred during development).
 This also explains that C ISTELL comes very close to R ELAX C OR for Catalan and Spanish in the system mentions 9 gold annotation setting, and even outperforms it in system mentions 9 predicted annotation . The performance decrease from true to system mentions is the expected one given the mention detection results shown in Table 7 . In general, recall registers a higher decrease than precision as the true mentions that are missed cannot be recovered, while the system mentions that do not have a true counterpart can still be counterbalanced during the training stage if the system learns to classify them as singletons. 5.3.4 State of the art It is not possible to compare the results of Table 8 with state-of-the-art results because different data sets were used, and because of the disagreements between the evaluation measures. All the data sets and evaluation software for this task are publicly available for anyone who wishes to assess their results, and Table 8 can be used as a baseline in the future.
 6 Analysis and discussion The results of Table 8 are compressed into a single score for each system output, making it hard to know what are the specific strengths and weaknesses of each system, whether they perform differently for different mention types, or whether they show similar patterns. In order to reveal details that cannot be seen in the numerical table of results, and by way of an error analysis, this section breaks down the true mentions 9 gold annotation coreference results by mention class (Table 9 ), and examines specific real examples (Figs. 2 , 3 ). This also leads us to reflect on the different evaluation measures, and consider how to choose the best output. 6.1 System analysis Breaking down the coreference score by mention class makes it easier to identify the  X  X  X asy X  X  and  X  X  X ard X  X  coreference relations, and consider whether they are system specific. To this end, we modified the four evaluation measures to obtain partial scores according to the mention classes described in Table 3 (Sect. 2 ). Table 9 displays the results by mention class; due to lack of space, we restrict it to the true mentions 9 gold annotation scenario (also because in this way we avoid errors from other annotation layers) and to the scores of one mention-based measure (CEAF) and one link-based measure (BLANC). 9 6.1.1 General observations about the scores by mention class The first notable observation from Table 9 is that the best-scoring classes in English are PN_ E and PN_ P , that is, proper nouns with either exact or partial match. However, not all the systems behave the same in this respect: while R ELAX C OR and R ECONCILE perform clearly better on PN_ P than on CN_ E , the C ISTELL scores for PN_ P are lower than for CN_ E and CN_ P . The example in Fig. 2 shows, for instance, that C ISTELL is the only system that links the Yemeni port of Aden and the port .In general, R ELAX C OR is a more precision-oriented system that is reluctant to corefer common nouns even if they match partially (recall also that R ELAX C OR was tuned for the CEAF evaluation measure, which is a measure that favors precision more than recall as can be seen in the baselines results). In contrast, in an attempt to improve recall, C ISTELL corefers more common nouns, but this results in an overall worse performance. R ECONCILE is the most precision-oriented system of the three and links a very small number of mentions (only two mentions in the example). Note that apart from PN_ E and PN_ P , it obtains very low scores for the other classes. This behavior could probably be changed by adjusting the value of the coreference decision threshold (set to the default 0.5 for this study) on the development set. If we rank the systems by the number of links, from highest to lowest, we obtain C between precision and recall.

The lowest-scoring classes for non-pronominal mentions in English are the non-exact-match ones, namely CN_ N and PN_ N to a lesser extent for C ISTELL , and CN_ N and CN_ P for R ELAX C OR and R ECONCILE . This is to be expected as these are the mentions that require more semantic and world knowledge to be solved, and it is in accordance with previous research. The semantic features used by the three systems are limited to NE type (i.e., whether two NE mentions belong to the same class) and WordNet (i.e., whether the two mention heads are connected by a synonymy or hypernymy relation in WordNet). In Fig. 2 , all the systems fail to link the USS Cole destroyer and the ship ,or a suspected terrorist attack that killed at least six sailors and the blast . There seems to be a trend in that C ISTELL evens out the classes of proper nouns and of common nouns, while a major strength of the other two systems is in solving proper nouns. 6.1.2 Languages Although the rankings of classes in Catalan and Spanish are highly comparable with the ranking in English, they show differences that are worth mentioning. Unlike in English, R ELAX C OR performs better on CN_ E than PN_ P in the two Romance languages. This was already the case for C ISTELL in English. This might have to do with the larger percentages of CN_ E but lower percentages of PN_ P in Catalan and Spanish observed in Table 4 . Despite the generally lower results in Catalan and Spanish, it is remarkable that the CN_ N and CN_ P classes obtain similar or even higher scores than English, especially for R ELAX C OR . The performance drop of R
ELAX C OR for the Romance languages appears to be largely due to the drop in the performance for proper noun classes (as well as pronouns, discussed next). 6.1.3 Pronouns In terms of pronouns, the systems behave differently: the hardest class is P_1 [ 2 for R
ELAX C OR , while it is P_3 U for C ISTELL and R ECONCILE (but not far from P_3 G for the latter). R ECONCILE performs the worst for pronominal mentions. It gives again priority to precision at the expense of a very low recall. R ELAX C OR stands outs especially in third-person pronouns, but the ungendered it pronoun poses problems for all the systems, as shown in Fig. 2 . In general, pronouns are harder to solve than full NPs. The scores for Catalan and Spanish are again lower than those for English, although they are not directly comparable because of the prevalence of elliptical subjects in the Romance languages. Interestingly enough, C ISTELL performs better than R ELAX C OR on P_ ELL , while the opposite is true on P_ REL . Recall that R ELAX C OR did not include any language-specific feature, which probably accounts for its low performance on ellipticals. Clearly, the scores for elliptical subjects would be much lower if they were not marked as tokens in both the gold-standard and predicted annotations. 6.1.4 Singletons The scores for singletons in Table 10 are computed as standard recall, precision, and F , because there is no need to use sophisticated coreference measures like CEAF or BLANC when we do not want to compare entities composed of more than one mention. From best to worst performance, the systems are R ELAX C OR &gt;R ECONCILE &gt; C
ISTELL . Again, C ISTELL and R ECONCILE behave the opposite in terms of recall and precision, the former showing a lower recall as it tends to link more mentions, whereas the conservative nature of R ECONCILE in establishing coreference links accounts for its very large recall but very low precision for singletons. Again, the performance drop in Catalan and Spanish is larger for R ELAX C OR than C ISTELL . Whereas C ISTELL shows no difference between the two Romance languages, R
ELAX C OR performs worse for Catalan. 6.2 Measure analysis As it was the case with the results in Tables 8 and 9 also reveals various contradictions between the evaluation measures in scoring the different outputs. C
ISTELL , for instance, obtains a larger score for CN_ E than CN_ P according to CEAF but smaller according to BLANC in English. The same tendency occurs with R ELAX C OR in Catalan, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, CEAF always shows that the CN_ E class is easier than the CN_ P class. It is not straightforward to explain the reason for this. It could be due to one of the drawbacks of CEAF: given that it establishes the best one-to-one entity alignment, if a CN_ P mention is correctly linked to a preceding mention but this does not fall under the  X  X  X est one-to-one alignment, X  X  X hen CEAF does not reward this link correctly solved at a local level. The examples in Figs. 2 and 3 also show disagreements between the scores. In the first example, C ISTELL and R ELAX C OR obtain the same CEAF score in both cases, whereas B 3 ranks R ELAX C OR first, and MUC and BLANC rank C ISTELL first. The link-based measures put more emphasis on correct coreference links (even if it is at the expense of incorrect ones), whereas the score of mention-based measures decreases rapidly in the presence of incorrect coreference links, as singletons count as an entity per se.
The example in Fig. 3 , where we can compare the outputs using true and system mentions in the gold scenario, also reveals the different sensitivities of each measure. In this example, singletons are marked within square brackets to better illustrate the true-system versus system-mention outputs. Surprisingly, the CEAF score stays the same in the two scenarios for C ISTELL and R ELAX C OR , also the MUC score for the latter system, while the rest of measures rank better the output in system mentions 9 gold annotation . This is a very short document and (in)correctly solving a single link can make a big difference. In the case of C ISTELL , for instance, although the first output might seem better at first sight, it links wrongly the mention Bechtel Power Corp . together with Consumers Power Co . and Consumers Power and Bechtel Power Corp . The second output also links wrongly one mention, power , but only with another mention ( Consumers Power and Bechtel Power Corp .). A similar issue happens in the R ELAX C OR outputs. Notice again the more precision-oriented nature of R ELAX C OR versus the more recall-oriented nature of C ISTELL .
Both examples illustrate the difficulty of evaluating coreference resolution: Do we prefer few but good links rather than more recall but less precision? The different results reported in this study indicate that the extreme cases are clear and the different measures agree, but in-between cases are not so clear and this is where the measures (and human annotators) often disagree. There is no correct answer in absolute terms, but a possible range of answers, and evaluation is very task-specific. Depending on the intended application, one or another answer will be preferred. If recall matters more than precision, it is wiser to use a link-based measure, whereas if precision matters more than recall, then it is wiser to use a mention-based measure. Although the tradition in coreference resolution evaluation has been to use intrinsic measures, the coreference community should start applying more extrinsic evaluation methodologies. 7 Conclusions This paper has presented a multi-dimensional empirical study of coreference resolution. The analyzed dimensions include:  X  Multilinguality : by using English, Catalan and Spanish corpora.  X  Approaches to coreference resolution : by including the entity-mention system  X  Evaluation measures : by evaluating with the mention-based measures B 3 and  X  Evaluation scenarios : by training with gold versus predicted input information,
Departing from the definition and materials of the SemEval-2010 Task 1 (Recasens et al. 2010 ), this study slightly reduces the complexity (fewer languages and systems, fewer evaluation settings), but produces a complete study, fixing also some of the design errors of the SemEval-2010 task and including a detailed discussion of system outputs and examples.

In Sect. 2 , a first study of the corpora is conducted, presenting statistics on the coreference annotation. The statistics reveal remarkable differences between the English and Romance corpora with respect to the proportion of singletons, the density of entity mentions, and the distribution of mentions by classes. Some of these phenomena have a linguistic interpretation, and they are later shown to influence the performance of the coreference resolution systems in each language.
Section 4 presents the full table with the results of all the systems across languages, settings and measures. This table represents the completion of the main analysis from the SemEval-2010 task. In general, systems perform better for English, followed by Spanish and Catalan. Reasons for this include properties of the corpora (e.g., the proportion of singletons) as well as the original language for which a system was originally developed.

All the evaluation measures agree that R ELAX C OR performs consistently better, especially for English. However, when comparing C ISTELL and R ECONCILE , they disagree in the overall results. Since the two systems have very different behavior in terms of precision and recall, this reveals that the measures tend to reward different aspects of quality. Therefore, unless the differences between systems are large, a single evaluation measure is not enough to allow for general quality comparisons. It seems necessary to apply more than one evaluation measure to make an informed decision about which measure fits best in each situation. Going one step further, the authors believe that the most reasonable way to go would be to use task-specific measures, both for developing and comparing systems, in order to provide valuable insights into how coreference resolution impacts the performance of NLP applications.

This work also highlights the limitation of the measures in relation to the extreme baseline systems. We show that according to some measures, there are cases in which real systems perform comparably or even worse than simply considering all the mentions as singletons (S INGLETONS ), or joining them all into a single entity (A
LL -IN -O NE ). Another subtle aspect of the difficulty of evaluating coreference is the mapping between true and system mentions when they do not coincide. As shown in this work, the adjustment proposed by Cai and Strube ( 2010 ) can be generalized to all the measures in order to avoid unfair evaluations. However, this adjustment turned out to have the counterintuitive effect of making the A LL -IN -O NE baseline based on system mentions obtain higher scores than the one based on true mentions.
Moreover, it was hard to draw reliable conclusions regarding the comparison between mention-pair (R ELAX C OR and R ECONCILE ) and entity-mention (C ISTELL ) approaches to coreference resolution. At first sight, it seems that mention-pair systems are biased toward high precision, while entity-mention systems are biased toward high recall. However, with only three systems it is not possible to determine whether performance differences are attributable to the intrinsic properties of each approach or to aspects from other dimensions. On the other hand, it seems that the factor that matters most for adapting a system to a specific corpus or language is adjusting the right parameters, learning features, and training conditions, rather than the approach or architecture itself. At this stage, we leave these two issues for further research.

In Sect. 6 , a more detailed analysis is performed by evaluating the systems according to mention classes. Previous research has emphasized that head matching mentions are the easiest to resolve, and we add to this observation that mentions headed by proper nouns are easier to resolve than mentions headed by common nouns. Obviously, coreferent mentions with different heads remain a major challenge. Some examples are also provided to back up some of the quantitative observations from the previous section with regard to the trends for each system and evaluation measure.

Last but not least, an additional valuable contribution of this work is the collection of resources that it has made available to the community, including the updated versions of the corpora and the scoring software, and the system outputs in a user-friendly format for viewing. We hope that these resources will be of interest to the coreference community, and that they will become benchmarks for future evaluations.
