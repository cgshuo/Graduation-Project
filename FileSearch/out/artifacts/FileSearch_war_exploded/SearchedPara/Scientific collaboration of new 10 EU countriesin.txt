 1. Introduction social sciences. The present study was based on the material of SSCI DB for 2002 . As is well known social ences make 8% and humanities only 3% of the total number of publications). It should be kept in mind that publications in those fields are mostly devoted to local and regional problems, and accordingly are not included in ISI DB.

Research cooperation is witnessed by the authors X  addresses: if a paper has two or more authors from dif-authors X  addresses were in would-be new member-states of EU. 2. Research activity and citation statistics
According to NSI Standard version: 1998 X 2002 saw 3 599 665 papers in the fields of science and social sci-ence published with USA as world leader contributing 34.17% of publication. The scientists from 15 EU mem-or more than 113 thousand papers).

The cited papers constitute 59.87% of all papers in NSI DB and 63.15% of all papers in EU countries. The corresponding figures of the 15 EU countries, except Greece, are higher  X  from 69.2 (Denmark) to 57.92 (Portugal). As for 10 EU candidate countries they vary little around the average figure in DB NSI (except
Slovakia and Malta) and much lower than average figure for 15 EU countries. To some extent lesser citedness tific production is reflected in the total number of citation of papers from this or that country.
The  X  X itation Impact X  is the ration of number of citation to the number of publications. The measure is
Impact in DB NSI is 4.25 and 4.54 for EU counties. The most significant differences among 15 EU countries are Netherlands, Denmark, UK and Sweden with higher Citation Impact and all 10 EU candidate-countries  X  with low Citation Impact less than 2.75; only two countries Estonia (the former USSR country) and Hungary exceed the figure at 3.
 tries is shown in Table 1 . 3. Research cooperation in the social sciences: results of study
In social sciences research activity is much lower than in science, e.g. in 2002 England had 13112 publica-the 10 new member-states is given in Table 2 .
 The per cent of joint publications is very high, the only exception is two states of former Czechoslovakia.
The indexes  X  X umber of publication per 1000 inhabits X  are approximately the same for most new EU mem-ber-states : 0.02 X 0.05, except Latvia, Poland and Lithuania which have the corresponding figures more less.
The analogous index of Germany is 0.06, France and Spain is 0.04, Italy  X  0.03. It need to note (emphasize) 2003 ).

As might be expected about 70% of all joint papers published in English, second comes Czech  X  20%, third place goes to Slovakian (nearly 7%).
 The statistics on the language of publication is given in Table 3 .

The 10 new member-states published 1060 papers in 380 scientific journals represented in DB SSCI. Titles of 14 journals which included 10 and more papers is given in Table 4 .

The 10 new EU candidate-countries in 2002 collaborated mostly with 15 EU countries and USA. Scientific the countries under study are given in Table 5 .
 On the basis of Table 5 a map of collaboration of the ten countries may be drawn.
 to the formula:
X ij  X  real number of joint publications of countries i and j ; m  X  mathematical expectation of number of joint publications of countries i and j ; F i  X  number of joint publications of country i ; F j  X  number of joint publications of country j ; N  X  total number of joint publications of 10 new EU countries ( N = 429).
 Collaboration relatedness between pairs of countries is given below in Table 6 (with S &gt; 0.5) and Fig. 1
Map of collaboration of 10 new EU member-states. 4. Conclusion 1. The 10 new EU member-states collaborated with 45 countries including the leaders in scientific research:
USA (101 joint publications), UK (55), Japan (5), Germany (44), France (16), Italy (8), Canada (11), China (2) and Russia (16), but also with such outsiders as Middle East countries (Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria), Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia), the developing countries of Africa (Morocco, Ethiopia) and Latin America (Brazil).

 both with 15 EU countries and their mutual collaboration in social science. There is no doubt that entrance into EU will boost research cooperation of new member-states with the core of EU. The EU scientific and education programs are sufficient proofs for that optimism.
