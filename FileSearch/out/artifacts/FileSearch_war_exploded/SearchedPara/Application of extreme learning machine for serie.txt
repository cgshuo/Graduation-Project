 1. Introduction
Series compensations are widely used these days due to increased power transfer capabilities of transmission lines. A typical series compensation scheme possesses a capacitor that is protected by a metal-oxide varistor (MOV) and an air-gap arrangement. Phadke and Thorp (1988) and Saha et al. (1999) discussed that protection of series compensated line is considered to be one of the most difficult tasks for relay manufactures and utility engineers due to the following reasons:
With series compensation, the steady state current is increased significantly, which may be greater than line-ground fault current toward the boundary of the line.

Since the MOV protected series capacitor introduces nonli-nearity in the circuit and causes additional transients in the system, distance relays will have a tendency to mal-operate.
Identification and classification of faults on a transmission line are essential for relaying decision and auto-closing requirement.
A conventional approach classifies the fault based on the funda-mental frequency components only. However, in a series compensated line, load current level may be of the order of fault current toward the boundary of a zone that will lead to wrong classification and malfunction of the relay. Further, in the presence of a series capacitor at the midpoint, the current level may be of the same order at two different fault points of the transmission line for the same type of fault. This will result in more complexity while locating the fault point on a transmission system. Therefore, in a series compensated transmission line, a more reliable approach is necessary for identifying the type of fault and the fault zone, which are behind or in front of the capacitor. Fault location estimation is another desirable feature in any protection scheme. Locating the fault on the transmission line accelerates line restoration and reduces the power disruption to consumers.

To address the above complexities of the protection of series compensated transmission line, different researchers have suggested various techniques in their literature. Thomas and
Christopulos (1992) proposed an algorithm based on traveling waves for the protection of series compensated lines. However, this method discusses only about a  X  g fault. Megahed et al. (2006) suggested wavelet based technique for protection of series compensated transmission line. However, the sampling frequency is high (200 kHz), which may prove to be little inconvenient for practical implementation. In general, the disadvantage of using conventional method of protection is that they operate on fixed settings and have to be reset for changes in the network config-uration. Artificial intelligence has evolved to be a remarkable tool for adapting to the changing network conditions and configura-tions and for providing an excellent performance.
 system protection are discussed in Warwick et al. (1997) . Fault classification in series compensated transmission line using fuzzy logic is discussed in Pradhan et al. (2004) , Pradhan et al. (2005) and Das and Vittal Reddy (2005) . Application of neural network to series compensated transmission line protection is discussed in
Dash et al. (2001) and Abdelaziz et al. (2005) . Although the ANN based approaches have been found to be quite successful in identifying the correct fault type, the main disadvantage is that it requires a considerable amount of training effort for good performance, especially under a wide variation of operating conditions (such as system loading level, fault resistance, fault inception instance, etc.). Recently, Dash et al. (2007) have pro-posed the SVM based method for fault section identification and classification of TCSC compensated transmission line. However, the performance of this method has been demonstrated only in over 200 cases. Also, the authors have not discussed the effect of variations in the source impedance and compensation level on the accuracy of fault classification and also the problem of fault location. Parikh et al. (2008) applied the SVM method for fault zone identification in a series compensated transmission line and tested with 25,200 fault cases. However, the authors have not demonstrated SVM for fault classification and location in a series compensated transmission line. Also, in this method, combined wavelet-SVM technique is applied for fault zone identification of series compensated transmission line with full-cycle data to produce classification accuracy of 93.917%. Malathi and
Marimuthu (2009) applied SVM for faulted phase detection in transmission line. However, the authors have not discussed fault classification and location in transmission line. Malathi et al. (2009) applied multi-class SVM and ELM for fault classification in series compensated transmission line. However, in this method, only the nature of fault has been identified, but the phases involved in the fault have not been determined.
 popular for solving classification and regression problems because of its universal approximation capability. Universal approximation capability of ELM is discussed in Huang et al. (2006a , 2006b) . Liang et al. (2006) have applied ELM for classifi-cation of mental tasks and Zhang and Kezunovic (2007) applied ELM for classification problem in cancer diagnosis.
 classify and locate the fault in a series compensated transmission line using combined wavelet transform-extreme learning machine. This technique uses the half-cycle data measured at one end of the transmission line. The proposed scheme has been tested on a 400 kV, 300 km series compensated transmission line under variety of fault conditions. The combined wavelet-ELM based approach identifies the fault section, classifies all the ten
This method is capable of protecting a series compen-sated transmission line under wide variations in operating con-ditions (i.e. fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault dis-tance, percentage compensation level, source impedance and load angle) in half-cycle period of fundamental frequency. The perfor-mance of the developed algorithm has been tested over a large data (28,800 test cases) with different system operating conditions. 2. Wavelet transform
Wavelet analysis discussed in Daubechies (1992) is a relatively new signal processing tool and is applied recently by many researchers in power systems due to its strong capability of time and frequency domain analysis. The definition of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for a given signal x ( t ) with respect to a mother wavelet C ( t ) is given by CWT  X  a , b  X  X  1 ffiffiffi a p where a is the scale factor and b is the translation factor. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of x ( k ) can be written as
DWT  X  m , n  X  X  1 ffiffiffiffiffiffi where the parameters a and b in (1) are changed to be the functions of integers m and n ,and x ( k ) is the sequence of samples from the continuous time function x ( t ). In Eq. (2), a 0 and b 0 scale and translation factor, resp ectively. The wavelet transform is useful in analyzing the transi ent phenomena associated with transmission line faults and/or switching operations. This technique can be used effectively for analyzing non-stationary signals compris-ing high and low frequency components, through the use of a variable window length of the signal. The ability of the wavelet transform to focus on short time intervals for high frequency components and long time intervals for low frequency components facilitates the analysis of transient signals effectively.
The choice of mother wavelet plays a major role in the characterization of the signal under study. The mother wavelet, whose characteristics match closely with the signal under con-sideration, would be the best choice. For studying power system fault signals, it has been reported by Zhang and Kezunovic (2007) and Urmil B. Parikh that Daubechies wavelet is the most suitable one. 3. Extreme learning machine (ELM)
Extreme learning machine proposed by Huang et al. (2006a , 2006b) is a new learning algorithm for single layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) whose learning speed is faster than traditional feed forward network learning algorithm like back propagation algorithm while obtaining better generalization per-formance. ELM has several significant features different from traditional popular gradient based learning algorithms for feed forward neural networks: (1) The learning speed of ELM is extremely fast. (2) The ELM has better generalization performance than the (3) The traditional classic gradient based learning algorithm has (4) Unlike the traditional classic gradient based learning algo-
The architecture of a single layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) is given in Fig. 1 . ELM randomly chooses and fixes the weights between input neurons and hidden neurons based on continuous probability density function, and then analytically determines the weights between hidden neurons and output neurons of the SLFN. The probability density function is a uniform distribution function in the range from 1to  X  1.

(3) Calculate the output weight b using b  X  H y T , where T is the target matrix, H is the hidden layer output matrix, H y is the Moore X  X enrose generalized inverse of the matrix H and b is the hidden layer output matrix. 4. Combined wavelet transform-ELM (WT-ELM) technique for series compensated transmission line protection
The framework of the entire protection scheme using the combined WT-ELM technique is shown in Fig. 3 . Sampled current values at the relaying point when the fault is persisting are used in first level decomposition of the current samples using discrete wavelet transform. Subsequently, the extracted features are applied as inputs to ELMs. ELM-1 is used for fault section identification; ELM-2 classifies the fault type an d ELM regression estimates the fault distance from the relaying point. The proposed method is tested on a 400 kV, 50 Hz series compensated transmission line. The single line diagram of a power system consisting of two sources representing two areas and a tie line of 300 km long, which connects middle of the line as shown. The MOV conduction level has been chosen as 2.5 times the rated current. The system and line parameters are given in Appendix. 4.1. Feature extraction
For fault section identification, classification and location, half-cycle fault current signal is pre-processed through DWT to extract the high frequency contents of a signal, which act as the features of the fault current. Through a series of studies, the sampling rate of 1.6 kHz (32 samples per cycle) is selected in this paper. Four different types of Daubichies mother wavelets (db1 X  X b4) are analyzed. The wavelet coefficients after the first level decomposi-tion of the fault current of each phase are used as inputs to ELMs for training and testing. 4.2. ELM training
The fault currents required for getting the training patterns for fault classification and section identification are generated by simulating ten different types of faults on the series compensated transmission line discussed in Section 4. To study the effective-ness of the proposed method under different system conditions, different combination of source impedances ( Z G1 and Z G2 percentage compensation levels ( X c ) have been considered. The different combinations of Z G1 , Z G2 and X c values, which have been investigated in this paper, are shown in Table 1 . From this table it is observed that, a total of ten different system conditions have been studied in this paper.

For the purpose of training, the fault simulation studies for all of load angle (10 1 ,30 1 ), fault inception angle (0 1 ,90 resistance (1 O ,10 O ) and fault locations (40%, 80%) for each of this ten system conditions. Thus a total of (10 10 2 2 2 2)  X  1600 cases are simulated.

The training patterns for fault location are generated by at different locations (starting from 10 km with increment of 10 km) on the transmission lines. Overall, the training patterns are generated for each type of fault on the transmission line over 29 locations with 2 fault resistances, 2 source impedance, 2 load angles and 2 fault inception angles. For each type of fault, the number of training pattern is 29 2 2 2 2  X  464 patterns.
All the simulations required for training and testing are carried out in MATLAB 7 environment running in a Pentium IV, 1.75 GHz
CPU. DWT has been implemented using WT toolbox in MATLAB environment. ELM is implemented using http://www.ntu.edu.sg/ home/egbhuang/ in MATLB environment. 4.3. Parameter selection testing of ELM. For ELM, the numbers of hidden neurons are gradually increased by 1 and the optimal number of hidden neurons for ELM is then selected based on training accuracy.
The number of hidden neurons selected for fault section identi-fication is 5. For fault classification, three ELMs (ELM-a, ELM-b,
ELM-c), one for each phase, are used. Training accuracy for variation in hidden neurons for ELM-c is shown in Fig. 4 .As shown in Fig. 4 , the number of hidden neurons selected for  X  X  X  phase is 5. Similarly, the number of hidden neurons selected for ELM-a and ELM-b are 2 and 4, respectively.
 hidden neurons are gradually increased by 1 till the root mean square error (RMSE) is less than 0.01. Fig. 5 shows variation of RMSE with variation of hidden neurons for LG fault. As in Fig. 5 ,
RMSE reduces as the number of hidden neurons increases. As shown in Fig. 5 , the number of hidden neurons selected for fault location with LG fault is 294. Similarly, the number of hidden neurons is selected as 204, 158 and 192 for LL, LLG and LLL faults, respectively.

Studies have also been made to investigate the performance of the ELM for fault section identification and classification with the sinusoidal activation function. It has been found that, with the sinusoidal activation function the maximum accuracy obtained for section identification and fault classification is 90.87% and 91.34%, respectively.

Studies have been carried out with different types of db mother wavelets, and the classification accuracies obtained for
From this table, it is observed that among the different db mother wavelets, db2 gives the best accuracy, and therefore, it has been used for feature extraction of current signals. Also, for fault location, db2 gives the least error, and hence, db2 is considered in this paper for fault section identification, classification and location. 4.4. ELM-1 for fault section identification
The samples of the fault currents during the half cycle immediately after the fault inception are used as input to DWT to extract the features, and the output of the DWT is given as input to ELM-1. The training and test patterns are normalized to [  X  1, 1]. Fig. 6 shows the fault currents observed at the relay point for a fault on the transmission line before and after the series capacitor. The ELM-1 is trained with 1600 datasets and series capacitor and  X  X  X 1 X  X  for faults after the series capacitor. 4.5. ELM-2 for fault classification
The wavelet coefficients obtained for the half-cycle fault current samples after the fault inception are taken as input to ELM-2. The structure of ELM-2 for fault classification is shown in ground, respectively. Three ELMs (ELM-a, ELM-b, ELM-c) are used to identify the faulted phase(s).The training and test patterns are normalized to [  X  1, 1]. The ELM-2 is trained with 1600 dataset and tested with 28,800 dataset. The output of each ELM (ELM-a, fault on that phase or not. To detect the involvement of ground during the fault, a zero-sequence current based indicator of the type proposed by Akke and Thorp (1998) :
Index  X  is used. When the index value exceeds the threshold value of 0.05, it indicates the involvement of ground in the fault. The ground Fault current, A detection is carried out in parallel with the ELM calculations. For example, if the outputs of ELM-2 are: y a  X  1, y b  X  1, y value is less than 0.05, then it is an L X  X  fault involving phases a and b. 4.6. ELM for fault location
The structure of ELM for fault location consists of four regres-sion blocks as shown in Fig. 8 . One of these blocks is triggered based on the fault type information obtained from ELM-2. The pre-processed fault current signals are used to train ELM. The training and test patterns are normalized to [  X  1, 1] and given as input to the ELM modules. In this case, the target value of each pattern is the distance from relay locations.

The testing patterns are generated for each type of fault on the transmission line over 29 locations with 10 fault resistances, 2 source impedances, 2 fault inception angles and 2 load angles.
For each type of fault, the number of testing pattern for fault location is 29 10 2 2 2  X  2320.

The criterion for evaluating the performance of the fault locator is defined as % error  X  5. Results and discussions
To test the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, a number of simulation studies have been carried out in the test system. The test sets are composed of over 28,800 cases including different fault resistances (1 X 200 O ), fault inception angles (0 X 120 source impedances (40 X 125%), percentage compensation levels (20 X 75%), load angles (20 X 60 1 ) and fault distances (20 X 80%). Test results for fault section identification are given in Table 3 .
As observed from Table 3 , the accuracy of the proposed method is quite satisfactory for all types of faults. The overall accuracy for fault section identification is 96.53% with half cycle data. This result is compared with the result obtained in Parikh et al. (2008) where the problem of fault section identification using the combined WT-SVM has been reported. Parikh et al. (2008) have used full cycle data and obtained an accuracy of 93.917%. Hence it may be observed that the result obtained using the method proposed in this paper for fault section identification in a series compensated line is better than the results reported in Parikh et al. (2008) .

Test results for fault classification are given in Table 4 .As shown in Table 4 , the overall classification accuracy for 28,800 test cases is found to be 99.11%. The results are compared with the results reported in Dash et al. (2007) , wherein the fault classification is done using SVM. Dash et al. (2007) have tested 200 cases only and obtained accuracies as stated in Table 4 .Itis 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 % error 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 % error 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 % error 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 % error observed that the results obtained in this paper for various faults are better compared to the results reported in Dash et al. (2007) . % testing error with WT-ELM is shown in Fig. 9 and the maximum error is less than 0.5%. Similarly, % testing error with WT-SVR is shown in Fig. 10 . The minimum and maximum error with WT-ELM and WT-SVR are given in Table 5 . From Table 5 ,itis observed that maximum fault location error with WT-ELM is less than WT-SVR.

The training and testing parameters are given in Table 6 .As shown in Table 6 , the system is trained with fault resistances of 1 and 10 O only and is tested with fault resistance up to 200 O . Similarly, the proposed method is also tested with parameters that are not included as part of training. Hence, it is observed that the proposed method is robust to parameter variations.
The authors have also studied fault section identification and classification using the current samples directly as input to ELM without pre-processing by DWT. The overall classification accu-racy obtained from this study for fault section identification and classification is 89.07% and 90.63%, respectively. As the technique presented in this paper gives better accuracy, the combined WT-ELM technique with half cycle current data is recommended compensated transmission line. 6. Conclusion
In this paper, a new method to identify the fault section, classify and locate different faults using combined WT-ELM technique is proposed for series compensated transmission line. The WT-ELM has been trained using a dataset consisting of 1600 typical cases and tested using 28,800 different cases. The average classification accuracy of the proposed WT-ELM method for fault section identification is 96.53% and for fault classification is 99.11%. The WT-ELM based approach shows better performance for fault section identification and classification for series com-pensated transmission line. It is interesting to note that the maximum fault location error with the combined wavelet-ELM is less than 0.5%. Also, the maximum fault location error with WT-ELM is less than WT-SVR for variation in fault resistance. It is also found that WT-ELM is robust to parameter variations such as fault distance, fault inception angle, load angle, source impedance, percentage compensation and fault resistance. This method is capable of protecting series compensated transmission line under wide variations in operating conditions in about half-a-cycle period of fundamental frequency, and hence, is quite suitable for integration in digital distance protection schemes.
