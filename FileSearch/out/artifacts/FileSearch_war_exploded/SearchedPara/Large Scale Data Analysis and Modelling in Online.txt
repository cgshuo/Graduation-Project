 1. We present the unique challenges involved in building a new advertisement ranking algorithm for Paid Search. To guide the modelling task, we developed a tool-chain which allows the storage and querying of weeks of click-through data from raw logs. In this task, we managed more than 3 billion advertisement impressions occupy-ing more than 1 TB of information. Ultimately, we were able to answer within minutes questions about the empirical dependency of the click-through rate on user features such as client IP and advertisement fea-tures such as match type . Central to this task was the development of a very fast object-relational mapping for converting data between the F# [3] type systems and the SQL type-system in order to build a data store of click-through meta-information about users and ad-vertisements. This tool-chain guided the development of features for training a Bayesian click-through es-timation algorithm based on expectation propagation [2]. We discuss how systems issues such as memory consumption and algorithmic performance influenced the modelling process. We also discuss the issue of sci-entific programming languages capable of dealing with CPU intensive task while allowing rapid prototyping and give a quick overview of F#, a functional pro-gramming language ideally suited for this task.
