 1. Introduction
The capability to link nodes is a (or rather  X  X  X he X  X ) major feature of hypertext systems. The largest such system, the WorldWideWeb cameto existence merely twelve yearsago,isaninherently distributedsystem, on which nearly everyone can publish pages. Publishing on the Web is more than just setting up a page or a site; it also usually involves linking to other pages on the Web.

Our literature searches showed that so far little has been done towards gaining an understanding of why and when authors of Web pages create links, and what are the characteristics of these links. The lack of researchin this area is rather surprising, since links are not only a means to link documents; links have been extensively used to improve the performance of IR systems (e.g. Brin &amp; Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1999;
Lempel &amp; Moran, 2001). Henzinger, Motwani, and Silverstein (2002) state that there has not been much research on link types, and although such research is needed since it may facilitate distinguishing commercial from editorial links or links to metainformation from links that relate to the actual content of the site.

Link analysis employed by Google (Brin &amp; Page, 1998), and the concepts of hubs and authorities (Kleinberg, 1999) are utilized to identify high quality sites. Those methods are based on the quasi-quali-tative assumption that high quality pages are those pages that receive links from a large number of high quality pages. One of the basic assumptions underlying link analysis is that links to a page or site show some sign of appreciation or approval of the target. Links are sometimes seen as analogues of citations in scientific publications. There are a large number of different reasons for citing a publication (see Liu, 1993, for an extensive review), and most of these motivations are positive, thus citations can be seen as a sign of appreciation for the cited work. Simple un-weighted citation counts work well for evaluating scientific publications but are not sufficient for the uncontrolled Web environment (although such methods were suggested, see for example, Carriere &amp; Kazman, 1997). A ranking scheme based on simple link counts can beeasilydeceivedbyspammers.Thus,links areweighted accordingtothe X  X  X uality X  X  X fthepagefromwhich they emanate, where  X  X  X uality X  X  is a function of the links pointing to that page. Link analysis methods are based on a quantitative measure of  X  X  X uality X  X .

Some of the links are almost surely created as a sign of appreciation, but others may very well be set up for technical reasons (e.g. for downloading applications) or they may be links to advertisements (e.g. in exchange for free space on a Web server, the page is required to carry some advertisement) or reciprocal links or created as part of emerging Web conventions. Henzinger et al. (2002) claim that such conventions do exist, but there are no empirical findings to support this claim.
 Links have also been studied in order to characterize the Web graph (Broder et al., 2000). Barabasi and
Albert (1999) found that the node connectivity follows a scale-free, power law distribution. This distri-bution is explained by X  X  X referential attachment X  X  X  X  X ew pages tend to link to pages that alreadyhave alarge number of links pointing to them. This behavior may be true for the Web as a whole, but Pennock, Flake,
Lawrence, Glover, and Giles (2002) discovered a considerably less biased distribution among subcategories of pages, i.e. although the overall distribution is close to a power law, in the distribution within the sub-categories  X  X  X referential attachment X  X  is much less emphasized, thus nodes with a small number of existing links also have a reasonable chance to receive new links. Their findings exemplify that modeling the global system based on numbers only may not be sufficient, and it is worthwhile to take a closer look.
The purpose of this study was to createaframeworkfor characterizingthe uses of links on the Web. The scopewaslimitedtotheacademicenvironment,i.e.links betweenacademicinstitutions,forseveralreasons: 1. An inclusive study of all types of Web pages would not allow us to create a detailed enough framework.
This study should be viewed as a first part of a larger study. 2. We wanted to look at an environment that is more  X  X  X deal X  X  than the Web as a whole. Presumably and hopefully, there are no financial or business oriented motives involved in linking or not linking in the academic environment (this may not be entirely true, institutions or units may choose to ignore the com-petition). Thus, if our assumption is true, this setting enables us to study  X  X  X ure X  X  linking motivations. 3. Henzinger et al. (2002) speak about  X  X  X eb conventions X  X  in general (rules Web authors follow without anybody imposing these rules on them). We believe that if such conventions exist, they will appear in the academic environment, where there are pre-Web conventions about the way CV X  X  or course syllabi or call-for-papers should look like.

In the following sections, we discuss the relevant literature and introduce our proposed framework. As a means of developing and validating the framework, we created a sample: the sample was drawn from pages residing in the domains of the eight public universities in Israel and having links pointing to pages in the domains of the other universities in this set (excluding internal or self links, i.e. links from a university page to a page residing in the domain of the same university). This sample has its limitations because links from abroad, from organizations, the industry and the government offices are not considered, but still this set was chosen, because of its relatively small size, that enabled us to retrieve all the pages in this set. 2. Literature review and background
Links are often seen as analogues of citations in scientific literature, although this analogy has its lim-itations (see for example, Egghe, 2000). Citation analysis (Garfield, 1979), the un-weighted predecessor of link analysis, is generally accepted as a useful tool for supporting research evaluations, studying the structureofscientificdisciplines,identifying X  X  X ot X  X  X esearchareasandforfollowingdevelopmentsisscience. The motivations for citations, unlike linking, were extensively studied.

Cronin (1984) discussed the role and significance of citations in scientific communications. He claimed that the composition of the reference links of scientific publications reflects the authors X  personalities, but because of the subjectivity of the process, citation motivations remain a matter of conjecture. In spite of this, several studies attempted to classify citations appearing in scientific literature, based on different factors, including: context, location (in which section of the article the reference appears), the extent to which the reference is discussed, the essentiality and the quality of the reference (e.g. supplementary, perfunctory), the waythe reference isdiscussed (e.g. criticism, affirmative,negative), the useof the reference within the citing publication, type of referenced sources (primary/secondary). Liu (1993) published an extensive review of citation studies. Some of the schemes are very detailed and complex (e.g. Lipetz, 1965; 29 categories in several groups), while others are much shorter (e.g. Peritz, 1983; 8 categories). Peritz X  X  aim was to design a scheme, which could be applied with as little subjective judgment as possible. Systems that do not rely heavily on subjective judgment and clearly delineate the different categories are more reliable (i.e. the results are more reproducible) and may be candidates for automating the process.

Existing typographies for citation motivations can be used as an inspiration for link motivations, but they cannot be utilized for the Web environment. The Web is a much more diverse environment and links haveadditionalfunctionsotherthanreferring toarticles,e.g. e-mails oftheauthorslinks totheiraffiliations or to their pictures or to sites where a utility to view some application can be downloaded.

Reasons for using hypertext links in hypertext systems other than the Web were also classified. Trigg (1983) developed a taxonomy of link types for a system made up of scientific publications. The taxonomy was very extensive; it included more than 50 link types in two main categories: normal (rhetorical links, e.g. background, formalization) and commentary (opinions of authors or readers). Baron, Tague-Sutcliffe,
Kinnucan, and Carey (1996) considered link labeling (adding information on link type) and experimented with it on a user X  X  guide. They differentiated between organizational links (these links ease navigation in the system) andcontent-basedlinks,whichwerefurthersubdividedtosemantic(e.g.similar,partof),rhetorical (e.g. definition, summary) and pragmatic links (e.g. warning, example). For an overview of existing clas-sification schemes one may consult Kopak X  X  review (1999).
 Note that these hypertext systems were much more homogeneous and controlled than the Web. On the
Web, the target page is often created by someone unknown to the creator of the source. Authors of Web pages have diverse goals for publishing their pages. The creator of the source interprets the target page and usually inserts the link without notifying or consulting the author of the target. Thus the intentions of the creators of the source and the target can be very different. The above-mentioned categorizations cannot be applied  X  X  X s-are X  X  to the Web, the first (Trigg, 1983) does not even consider navigational links, while in the second (Baron et al., 1996) there does not seem to be an appropriate category for example for link pages or for personal bookmarks.
 The last part of our literature review covers work related to link and page type classification on the Web.
Cronin, Snyder, Rosenbaum, Martinson, and Callahan (1998) classified page types for pages on which the names of prominent information scientists appeared. Additional page type classifications, but not strictly for the academic environment, were introduced by Bar-Ilan (2000, 2002). Kim (2000) interviewed authors of scholarly e-papers, about the reasons for inserting hypertext links into the article. She defined three major categories: scholarly, social and technological motivations.

Haas and Grams (1998a, 1998b) developed a classification of link types for this environment. The major categories were: navigation (e.g. within a site, within a document, link to help or contact info), expansion (e.g. definition, abstract, diagram), resource (topically related or specific) and miscellaneous. Besides identifying the intended use of a link, they also looked at the setting of the link, and differentiated between isolated, labeled and embedded settings. Isolated and embedded related to the position of the anchor in the document, while a labeled anchor was preceded by a word or a phrase that explicitly defined the role of the link anchor. They also examined the availability of the target page, whether the link was to the same page, to the same site, to the whole page or to a specific fragment and whether the target contained a direct reciprocallinktothesourcepage.Inadditiontoclassifyinglinks,theexaminedpageswerealsocategorized.
Haas and Grams analyzed the content of 75 pages containing nearly 1500 links. The pages were collected through a no longer existing utility of AltaVista, called the  X  X  X urprise Link X  X .

Crowston and Williams (2000) used a random sample of 1000 URLs from the AltaVista database to study  X  X  X enres X  X  on the Web. They identified about 50 different genres, some existed  X  X  X s-is X  X  in the pre-Web world, others were adapted (traditional genres enhanced with links) and they also identified novel genres that did not exist previously, yet are already well accepted by the general Web community (e.g. hotlists and interactive pages).

Thelwall and his coauthors classified target pages and links between academic institutions in several papers (Thelwall, 2001, 2002, 2003; Thelwall &amp; Harries, 2003; Wilkinson, Harries, Thelwall, &amp; Price, 2003).
In the first paper (Thelwall, 2001), a relatively coarse classification of the target pages was carried out in ordertodifferentiate between research orientedandnon-researchorientedlinks.In2002,Thelwallclassified the contents of the top 100 linked-to pages on UK University Web Sites. The major finding was that the mostly highly linked-to pages were not providing scholarly content.

Thelwall and Harries (2003) again characterized the target and not the links, and examined the corre-lation between the target types and the research activity of the institutions. They introduced four target types: non-locally created, non-academic content, high profile pages and subsites and other. Different models for the target were used: pages, directories, domains and universities. The Web page is not a logical but a physical unit, and thus it is reasonable to examine aggregated units as well. They classified the aggregated units as well using the same categories as for single pages. The paper shows that when con-sidering links counts only to research oriented units of classification (pages, directories, domains) the correlation between such link counts and research activity becomes even stronger.

The above-mentioned papers by Thelwall and his coauthors classified the page type of the targets only, while in Wilkinson et al. (2003) they characterized the links themselves. They picked a random set of 414 links between UK academic institutions, downloaded both the source and the target pages and charac-terized the links. Ten reasons for linking were identified: learning material, information for students, re-search support and resources, research partners, recreational, page creator or sponsor, research reference, tourist information, libraries and e-journals and similar department. They found that more than 90% of the links were created for scholarly reasons, but only two were equivalent to journal citations. In an additional paper, Thelwall (2003) characterized the motivations for linking to university homepages from a random set of 100 anchors emanating from pages residing at the domains of other UK universities. Five types of motivations were identified: ownership (authorship or coauthorship), social, general, navigational and gratuitous (link not expected to be used).

Our classification framework was developed inductively based ona sample of the collected pages. Again, we were unable to apply the existing schemes  X  X  X s are X  X . Haas and Grams defined the category  X  X  X avigation X  X  in great detail. This category contained subcategories of different types of organizational links within a site or within a  X  X  X ogical document X  X . This detailed classification was well justified for their case, since almost 50% of the links belonged to this category. They examined and classified all links emanating from a page, whereas we limited the scope to links between different academic institutions. Navigational links (i.e. back, home, top) are usually within the same site. We only considered links between different domains, thus we hadcomeacrossonly afew links thatwerenavigationalin nature. Thusalmostall ofthe links in thesets we examined would have been categorized as  X  X  X opically related resource X  X  (with no further subdivisions) according to the taxonomy proposed by Haas and Grams. This category was appropriate for the set examined by them, since only 15% of the links were classified as resource (with the subcategories topically related resources and specific information). Here we needed a much finer classification for  X  X  X esource links X  X , in order to identify possible emerging Web conventions.

Cronin et al. (1998) defined page types for pages on which prominent information scientists are men-tioned. Such pages overlap with pages from which links to other universities emanate, but again do not cover allpossibilities sincethey were only looking atpages mentioning(not linking to)persons,while inour case we looked at pages containing links not only to persons but to academic or administrative units and to applications as well. On the one hand they defined finer units for page types (e.g. abstract, article and syllabus),butontheotherhandtheyhadnotincluded categorieslikeservices andadministrativeunits.Bar-
Ilan (2000, 2002) defined page types for specific cases, but these were not directly applicable for the aca-demic environment. Crowston and Williams (2000) identified emerging genres on the Web; their work was helpful for defining page types. Thelwall (2001) did not include the specific page types in his paper X  X  X here the aim was to differentiate only between research and non-research oriented pages. The most heavily linked pages were classified into 13 categories. Some of his categories are similar to ours, however we had more categories: one highly prevalent category in our set X  X  X ersonal homepages X  X  X oes not appear in his list X  X  X here were no such pages among the top linked-to pages. Thelwall and Harries (2003) identified four major page types X  X  X xamples of each type were already given before. We see that there is similarity between thesepagetypesandthepagetypeswedefined,butourclassificationismorerefined.Wilkinsonetal.(2003) characterized reasons for links they defined 10 categories, again some overlap our categories. Thelwall (2003) considered only motivations. To summarize X  X  X e see similarities between previous characterizations and the one developed in this study, but our classification is more complete, since we used multiple facets instead of a single facet at a time, like in most previous papers (except for Haas &amp; Grams, 1998a, 1998b).
We also searched for additional sources in order to try to utilize existing classifications/typologies. The recommendations of the Dublin Core Initiative (DCMI, 2003) are rather general, however some of the definitionsoftheDCMITypeVocabularyaresimilartoours(e.g.eventandservice).Indevelopingsomeof the proposed categories we also consulted the DAML ontology library (DAML, 2003).
 The current study examines only academic sites and is limited only to links to other academic sites.
Linking out of the source site is probably less significant in the business domain, since Rhodes (1999) advises to  X  X  X ink out of your own site as a last resort ... you want to keep your visitors on your site X  X .
However linkage patterns of business sites should be examined as well, but they are not in the scope of this study. The study is limited only to academic sites in order to be able to gain a deeper understanding of a certain type of sites as a first step in a larger study. 3. Link and page type classification
The specific purpose of our study was to identify possible reasons for linking between academic sites on the Web. Such a study can either be carried out by examining Web pages and trying to assign reasons for inserting links, or by interviewing the Web page creators for their motivations. We chose the first option, so that we could base and test our initial classification on a large set of diverse pages.

A hypertext link connects two pages, the source and the target, thus it is not sufficient to characterize the link itself, the source and the target pages have to be taken into account as well. The main properties for characterizing sources, targets and links appear in Table 1 and the relationships between the examined objects are depicted in Fig. 1 in an E-R type diagram (see for example, Korth, Silberscahtz, &amp; Sudershan, 2001,Chap. 2).Therectanglesrepresent entities andthe diamonds relationships between entities, InanE-R diagram there can be no direct connection between two entities X  X  X hey are always connected through a relationship. In Fig. 1, the arrow from  X  X  X inked area X  X  to  X  X  X elongs X  X  designates the fact that a certain  X  X  X inked area X  X  belongs to one source page only. The converse is not true, there can be several  X  X  X inked areas X  X  on a source page. Thus the relationship is one-to-many, and because of this there is no need to create an object named  X  X  X elongs X  X  in our framework. Ellipses designate the attributes describing the entities and the rela-tionships. In our framework we call them  X  X  X roperties X  X .

The source was examined more thoroughly than the target for two reasons: 1. The source page was available, while the target page was often non-existent (was either removed from the Web or the creator of the source misspelled its URL) or might have changed since the link to it was created (we had no way of knowing this). 2. Links are directed and can be (most often are) created without the knowledge of the author of the target.
When examining linker motivation we believe that characteristics of the source page are more influential than those of the target page. A different approach, mainly for convenience, was taken by Thelwall (2001).
He based the decision whether a link was research related or not only on the target page only, although he notedthatitwas X  X  X undamentallyimpossibletodetermine thereasonforthelinkbaseduponthetargetpage only X  X .
 The categories for page type (source and target) and for link context properties appear in Table 2.
Page type roughly means what the page as a whole describes. When speaking of units and persons we mean that the page  X  X  X elongs X  X  to them or describes them (i.e. the homepage of a society, a department, a project or a course, or a personal homepage). Event pages provide details of specific events (e.g. a con-ference or a seminar), while examples of services in the academic environment are libraries, helpdesks and databases. A page is categorized as content , if it contains textual information, but does not describe entities (e.g. a research article). Non-textual resources are rarely source pages (except for clickable images and sensitive maps), but can appear as targets. A page as a whole was classified under structural information only if navigational information makes up the major part of the page.

Linked area is the anchor text and the text in the immediate vicinity of the anchor that is closely related to the anchor itself (e.g. in a list of links, the link and its short description is the linked area ). Often no additional description is given, in which case the linked area is only the anchor text. Linked area is an object that is described through the property link context .

Link context describes the way the link is discussed on the source page. We used the same categories for link context as for page type but with a slightly different meaning: here we meant what was discussed by the source page related to the specific link (i.e. the anchor text and the text around it, called link area ). To exemplify the difference between the page type and the link context , consider the following: a source page announcing a conference may mention the organizers (persons) with links to their homepages and departments. In this case, the source describes an event , mentions a person and links to two targets: a person and an unit . In this case the linked area of both links will be the respective anchor text.

Additional aspects that we found relevant to the classification and were identifiable by examining the page were:  X  Creator/publisher  X  X  X t was nearly impossible to differentiate between the two just by looking at the page  X  Academic field of creator (either administrative or belonging to a specific discipline). The value for this  X  Intention of creator ( observed ) X  X  X ere we attempted to identify why the page was created. In order to find  X  Language (relevant for non-English sites).

The links to the target institution were classified according to relationship between source and target , intention , tone and placement of link . The tone of the link was either positive , negative , neutral (e.g. a navigational link) or Web convention (e.g. inserting a link to the Alma Mater) or unknown . Links that are classified as Web conventions are links that the author of the source page is expected to insert, often without the intention that the link is to be followed (similar to the gratuitous motivation defined by
Thelwall, 2003). If and when categorizations such as the ones developed here will be taken into account for developing finer link analyses techniques, probably positive links should receive higher weights than the other types. The values for the property placement of link were: part of a list , embedded and sidebar/menu/ logo . For intention we used the same values as for the intention property of the source. A link was classified as professional when the target person/unit was in some kind of professional/work relation with the person/ unit mentionedin the source; andwasdefinedas research oriented when itreferred to some research activity of the target university. The intention of the source page can be rather different from the intention of the insertedlink.Forexample,consideraconferencepage(itsintentionis research oriented )thatcontainsalink describing the tourist sites at the conference venue (the intention of the link is social/leisure ). The values for the property relationship between source and target appear in Table 3.

For the target pages, we only specified their page type (see Table 2). In case the target page was unavailable, we tried to rely on the URLs to fill in the missing information. When we were not confident enough in our decision, the  X  X  X nspecified X  X  value was assigned to this field. When the link pointed to the opening page of a site, we attempted to considered the whole site (when accessible), and not the specific page, because when linking to an opening page of a site, we assumed that the author of the source page often wants the reader to browse or use the whole target site and not just the opening page. In cases where the site as a whole contained a substantial amount of direct information it was categorized as contribution ( direct information ),even thoughasasinglepageitwouldhavebeen categorized as mixed content or evenas structural info . Thus page types of source and target pages are not directly comparable.

Multiple assignments were allowed for each category, since the Web page is not a well-defined infor-mation unit, and often can be logically subdivided. Even when a page was related to a single issue only, it could contain multiple links to pages at the target institution, and these links could be of different type and purpose. Each such link was identified and classified separately. The values assigned to the different properties were based on the examination of currently existing Web pages appearing in academic sites.
In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, we characterized a small sample of pages and links between academic institutions. The data collection and the results are described in the following sections. A slightly different characterization of another subset of pages from the Israeli academic
Web appears in Bar-Ilan (2004). In the current paper we had drawn conclusions from the previous char-acterization exercise and developed the framework and the specific values of properties that are introduced in the current paper.

We only considered links between domains of academic institutions within a country. This clearly is a limitation, but it allowed us to collect a complete set of data using a public search engine. Public search engines limit the number of displayed results, usually to around 1000. At the time of the data collection
FAST (now AlltheWeb) displayed around 4000 results for a given query. 4. The dataset
The Israeli Web domains are relatively well organized, academic sites are all in the domain ac.il, where the pages of aspecific university are all (or most, there are always some exceptions) in the same second level subdomain, e.g. the pages of the Tel-Aviv University are all in domains whose names end with tau.ac.il.
Thus the organization is similar to the .edu domain in the US or the ac.uk domain in the UK. Data was collected using the FAST search engine ( http://www.alltheweb.com ) at the end of May 2002. The advanced search form was utilized, the main search box was left empty and two out of the three text boxes under it were filled in. For both of them the  X  X  X ust include X  X  option was chosen. In the first box we entered the subdomain of the linking university and chose the  X  X  X n the URL X  X  option; in the second box we entered the subdomain of the linked university and chose the  X  X  X n the link to URL X  X  option. Recently FAST added an additional option  X  X  X n the host name X  X , however this option was non-existent at the time of data collection.
Self-links were not collected only a count of them, as reported by the search engine was recorded. We also recorded the number of pages belonging to each university that were indexed by the search engine. The results pages were saved, the URLs of the displayed hits were extracted, and all the URLs were down-loaded. The collection of Web data was facilitated by helper applications, programs written in Visual Basic for running the queries and extracting the URLs from the search results and by the freeware application
URL2FILE ( http://www.chami.com/free/url2file_wincon.html ) for downloading the URLs. Altogether 5783 pages were downloaded. Note that a page could be downloaded several times in case it had links to several universities. The distribution of the downloaded Web pages appears in Table 4. The universities in the list appear in alphabetical order.

Before defining the sample, a little background about the Israeli universities: There are eight universities in Israel (see Council for Higher Education in Israel, 2002). The largest and best-known universities are the
Tel-Aviv University and the Hebrew University. These two and the fast-developing Ben-Gurion University cover most disciplines. Bar-Ilan University X  X  mission is to integrate Jewish tradition and science. It does not have a medical school and just recently opened engineering. The University of Haifa puts an emphasis on the humanities, the social sciences and law and does not have a medical school or a faculty of science.
The Technionis the Israel Institute of Technology and besides engineering, architecture and exact sci-ences it also has a medical school. The Weizmann Institute of Science only teaches graduate students and it is an outstanding research institution in the exact and life sciences. The Open University has a similar structure to other open universities in the world; it is accredited to award bachelor X  X  and master X  X  degrees only.

For the classification we picked a random 10% subset of these pages (584 URLs). Note that a URL could appear several times in the dataset in case it had links to several other universities. Thus each page was tagged with the name of the target university. Sometimes several links to the target university were located on a given page; in this case each link was classified separately (altogether, we classified 1007 links).
To asses the reliabilityof the classifications itis customary that some of the documents are also classified by a second coder. Thus 10% of the set of 584 URLs were classified by an additional coder. Inter-coder agreementwasbetween81%and96%dependingonthefacet(therewas100%agreementonthelanguageof the page and the placement of the link): 96% agreement on the academic unit and tone, 92% on page type, link context and creator, 90% on the intention of the page and of the link, 85% on target type and 81% on relationship. 5. Results Here we summarize the results of the classification of the above-mentioned 10%. In another paper (Bar-
Ilan, 2004) we carried out a more extensive content analysis of a larger sample, but as we pointed out before, slightly other properties were used X  X  X specially for the categories page type and link relationship, that were much more specific (Bar-Ilan, 2004).

We analyzed 584 pages and identified 1007 links from these source pages to the given target institution, i.e. the average number of links from a page to the given university (links to different universities were examined separately) was 1.72. The number of links ranged between 1 and 21.

The most frequently occurring source pages types were: compilations (lists) (209 pages, 35.8%), contri-butions (actual information) (114 pages, 19.5%), units (physical and logical) (78 pages, 13.4%) and persons (72 pages, 12.3%). The largest set of pages (188, 32.2%) was created by individuals, followed by academic units (111, 19.9%) and external units (mainly societies and organizations whose pages reside at the given university) (57 pages, 9.8%) and libraries (47 pages, 8.0%). On the other hand the distribution of the target page types was rather different (here the percentages are calculated out of 1007): the most popular target type was person (359 mentions (could be a Web page or an e-mail address), 35.7%), followed by unit (physical or logical) (318 mentions, 31.6%) and contribution (actual information) (133 pages, 13.2%). The most frequent category for source type X  X  X ists X  X  X omprised only 3.7% of the target types. This finding seems to demonstrate the hub-authority nature (see Kleinberg, 1999) of the Web: links emanate from hubs (lists) and point to sources that carry actual information (authority). As a further demonstration of the  X  X  X ubby X  X  nature of the source pages, we found that 803 of the examined links (79.7%) appeared as part of a con-centration (in lists of links), and only 18.5% of the links were classified as embedded (the rest, 1.8% ap-peared in menus/sidebars/logos).

The creators of 176 pages (29.6%) came from the fields of computer science/mathematics/engineering, followed by the social sciences (104 pages, 17.8%), the medical and life sciences (89 pages, 15.2%) and the humanities (84 pages, 14.4%). These numbers seem to indicate that the level of technological enabling and background influences Web publishing. It will be interesting to follow up on this point.

We found slight differences between the observed intention of the pages and the links: in both cases the most frequently assigned value was professional (36.0% and 31.9% respectively), however a larger per-centage (27.6%) of the links than pages (21.1%) was classified as research oriented . The third most fre-quently occurring value for pages was educational (13.5%), while for links it was informative (13.7%). In most cases pages classified as belonging to a given value (e.g. research oriented ) had links that were inserted with the same intention.

Finally we present our major findings on the relationship between the link area and the target . The most frequentlyassignedvalues were(indescending order):isA(12.7%),providesInformation(10.4%),isRelated/ isSimilar (8.6%), isCreatedBy (8.2%), providesService (7.6%) and isUseful/isRelevant (7.0%).

Naturally, one cannot arrive at far reaching conclusions based on such a small sample; it only dem-onstrates the applicability of the proposed framework. 6. Conclusion
We created a detailed framework for link characterization in order to learn about the nature of links between academic institutions. The Web is on the one-hand dynamic and ever changing, on the other hand
Web standards and customs are emerging slowly. If, as we believe, these standards and customs are becoming stable, then the proposed framework is a good basis for future work as well. Naturally such a scheme cannot be fixed; it will have to be updated periodically in order to reflect the social and techno-logical changes on the Web.

Human classification of links is very time consuming, but it provides empirical evidence that Web conventions related to the creation of links are emerging. Such classification should lead to a finer auto-matic link analysis that emphasizes content-bearing links, along the lines suggested by Henzinger et al. (2002). A better understanding of the different functions of linking will lead to a better understanding of  X  X  X uality links X  X , and to more finely tuned algorithms for link analysis, which in turn will improve ranking and the identification of  X  X  X igh quality X  X  sites.

We demonstrated on arather small samplethe applicability of the proposed framework. We recommend that further studies should be carried out to assess applicability and to suggest refinements of the current framework.

The classifications proposed here can be useful for creating personalized rankings X  X  X f for example only research related pages are of interest, research related links should receive higher weights. We also believe that positive tone should receive higher weight that neutral or Web convention.

Even if some of the properties introduced here are not going to be directly applied to improve rankings, they can still be useful for studying the structure and the social influences of the Web. References
