 Understanding what items will be retained in the public consciousness, and why, is a question of fun-damental interest in many domains, including mar-keting, politics, entertainment, and social media; as we all know, many items barely register, whereas others catch on and take hold in many people X  X  minds.

An active line of recent computational work has employed a variety of perspectives on this question. Building on a foundation in the sociology of diffu-sion [27, 31], researchers have explored the ways in which network structure affects the way information spreads, with domains of interest including blogs [1, 11], email [37], on-line commerce [22], and so-cial media [2, 28, 33, 38]. There has also been recent research addressing temporal aspects of how differ-ent media sources convey information [23, 30, 39] and ways in which people react differently to infor-mation on different topics [28, 36].

Beyond all these factors, however, one X  X  everyday experience with these domains suggests that the way in which a piece of information is expressed  X  the choice of words, the way it is phrased  X  might also have a fundamental effect on the extent to which it takes hold in people X  X  minds. Concepts that attain wide reach are often carried in messages such as political slogans, marketing phrases, or aphorisms whose language seems intuitively to be memorable,  X  X atchy, X  or otherwise compelling.

Our first challenge in exploring this hypothesis is to develop a notion of  X  X uccessful X  language that is precise enough to allow for quantitative evaluation. We also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered  X  highly-cited quotes tend to have been delivered under com-pelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural, po-litical, or social narrative, and potentially what ap-peals to us about the quote is really just its invoca-tion of these extra-linguistic contexts. Is the form of the language adding an effect beyond or indepen-dent of these (obviously very crucial) factors? To investigate the question, one needs a way of control-ling  X  as much as possible  X  for the role that the surrounding context of the language plays.
 The present work (i): Evaluating language-based memorability Defining what makes an utterance memorable is subtle, and scholars in several do-mains have written about this question. There is a rough consensus that an appropriate definition involves elements of both recognition  X  people should be able to retain the quote and recognize it when they hear it invoked  X  and production  X  peo-ple should be motivated to refer to it in relevant sit-uations [15]. One suggested reason for why some memes succeed is their ability to provoke emotions [16]. Alternatively, memorable quotes can be good for expressing the feelings, mood, or situation of an individual, a group, or a culture (the zeitgeist ):  X  X er-tain quotes exquisitely capture the mood or feeling we wish to communicate to someone. We hear them ... and store them away for future use X  [10].
None of these observations, however, serve as definitions, and indeed, we believe it desirable to not pre-commit to an abstract definition, but rather to adopt an operational formulation based on exter-nal human judgments. In designing our study, we focus on a domain in which (i) there is rich use of language, some of which has achieved deep cultural penetration; (ii) there already exist a large number of external human judgments  X  perhaps implicit, but in a form we can extract; and (iii) we can control for the setting in which the text was used.

Specifically, we use the complete scripts of roughly 1000 movies, representing diverse genres, eras, and levels of popularity, and consider which lines are the most  X  X emorable X . To acquire memo-rability labels, for each sentence in each script, we determine whether it has been listed as a  X  X emo-rable quote X  by users of the widely-known IMDb (the Internet Movie Database), and also estimate the number of times it appears on the Web. Both of these serve as memorability metrics for our purposes.
When we evaluate properties of memorable quotes, we compare them with quotes that are not as-sessed as memorable, but were spoken by the same character, at approximately the same point in the same movie. This enables us to control in a fairly fine-grained way for the confounding effects of con-text discussed above: we can observe differences that persist even after taking into account both the speaker and the setting.

In a pilot validation study, we find that human subjects are effective at recognizing the more IMDb-memorable of two quotes, even for movies they have not seen. This motivates a search for features in-trinsic to the text of quotes that signal memorabil-ity. In fact, comments provided by the human sub-jects as part of the task suggested two basic forms that such textual signals could take: subjects felt that (i) memorable quotes often involve a distinctive turn of phrase; and (ii) memorable quotes tend to invoke general themes that aren X  X  tied to the specific setting they came from, and hence can be more easily in-voked for future (out of context) uses. We test both of these principles in our analysis of the data. The present work (ii): What distinguishes mem-orable quotes Under the controlled-comparison setting sketched above, we find that memorable quotes exhibit significant differences from non-memorable quotes in several fundamental respects, and these differences in the data reinforce the two main principles from the human pilot study. First, we show a concrete sense in which memorable quotes are indeed distinctive : with respect to lexi-cal language models trained on the newswire por-tions of the Brown corpus [21], memorable quotes have significantly lower likelihood than their non-memorable counterparts. Interestingly, this distinc-tiveness takes place at the level of words, but not at the level of other syntactic features: the part-of-speech composition of memorable quotes is in fact more likely with respect to newswire. Thus, we can think of memorable quotes as consisting, in an ag-gregate sense, of unusual word choices built on a scaffolding of common part-of-speech patterns.
We also identify a number of ways in which mem-orable quotes convey greater generality . In their pat-terns of verb tenses, personal pronouns, and deter-miners, memorable quotes are structured so as to be more  X  X ree-standing, X  containing fewer markers that indicate references to nearby text.

Memorable quotes differ in other interesting as-pects as well, such as sound distributions.

Our analysis of memorable movie quotes suggests a framework by which the memorability of text in a range of different domains could be investigated. We provide evidence that such cross-domain prop-erties may hold, guided by one of our motivating applications in marketing. In particular, we analyze a corpus of advertising slogans, and we show that these slogans have significantly greater likelihood at both the word level and the part-of-speech level with respect to a language model trained on mem-orable movie quotes, compared to a corresponding language model trained on non-memorable movie quotes. This suggests that some of the principles un-derlying memorable text have the potential to apply across different areas.
 Roadmap  X  2 lays the empirical foundations of our work: the design and creation of our movie-quotes dataset, which we make publicly available (  X  2.1), a pilot study with human subjects validating IMDb-based memorability labels (  X  2.2), and further study of incorporating search-engine counts (  X  2.3).  X  3 de-tails our analysis and prediction experiments, using both movie-quotes data and, as an exploration of cross-domain applicability, slogans data.  X  4 surveys related work across a variety of fields.  X  5 briefly summarizes and indicates some future directions. 2.1 Data To study the properties of memorable movie quotes, we need a source of movie lines and a designation of memorability. Following [8], we constructed a corpus consisting of all lines from roughly 1000 movies, varying in genre, era, and popularity; for each movie, we then extracted the list of quotes from IMDb X  X  Memorable Quotes page corresponding to the movie. 1
A memorable quote in IMDb can appear either as an individual sentence spoken by one character, or as a multi-sentence line, or as a block of dialogue in-volving multiple characters. In the latter two cases, it can be hard to determine which particular portion is viewed as memorable (some involve a build-up to a punch line; others involve the follow-through after a well-phrased opening sentence), and so we focus in our comparisons on those memorable quotes that appear as a single sentence rather than a multi-line block. 2
We now formulate a task that we can use to eval-uate the features of memorable quotes. Recall that our goal is to identify effects based in the language of the quotes themselves, beyond any factors arising from the speaker or context. Thus, for each (single-sentence) memorable quote M , we identify a non-memorable quote that is as similar as possible to M in all characteristics but the choice of words. This means we want it to be spoken by the same charac-ter in the same movie. It also means that we want it to have the same length: controlling for length is important because we expect that on average, shorter quotes will be easier to remember than long quotes, and that wouldn X  X  be an interesting textual effect to report. Moreover, we also want to control for the fact that a quote X  X  position in a movie can affect memorability: certain scenes produce more mem-orable dialogue, and as Figure 1 demonstrates, in aggregate memorable quotes also occur dispropor-tionately near the beginnings and especially the ends of movies. In summary, then, for each M , we pick a contrasting (single-sentence) quote N from the same movie that is as close in the script as possible to M (either before or after it), subject to the conditions that (i) M and N are uttered by the same speaker, (ii) M and N have the same number of words, and (iii) N does not occur in the IMDb list of memorable quotes for the movie (either as a single line or as part of a larger block).

Given such pairs, we formulate a pairwise com-parison task : given M and N , determine which is the memorable quote. Psychological research on subjective evaluation [35], as well as initial experi-ments using ourselves as subjects, indicated that this pairwise set-up easier to work with than simply pre-senting a single sentence and asking whether it is memorable or not; the latter requires agreement on an  X  X bsolute X  criterion for memorability that is very hard to impose consistently, whereas the former sim-ply requires a judgment that one quote is more mem-orable than another.

Our main dataset, available at http://www.cs. cornell.edu/  X  cristian/memorability.html, 3 thus con-sists of approximately 2200 such ( M, N ) pairs, sep-arated by a median of 5 same-character lines in the script. The reader can get a sense for the nature of the data from the three examples in Table 1.
We now discuss two further aspects to the formu-lation of the experiment: a preliminary pilot study involving human subjects, and the incorporation of search engine counts into the data. 2.2 Pilot study: Human performance As a preliminary consideration, we did a small pilot study to see if humans can distinguish memorable from non-memorable quotes, assuming our IMDB-induced labels as gold standard. Six subjects, all na-tive speakers of English and none an author of this paper, were presented with 11 or 12 pairs of mem-orable vs. non-memorable quotes; again, we con-trolled for extra-textual effects by ensuring that in each pair the two quotes come from the same movie, are by the same character, have the same length, and appear as nearly as possible in the same scene. 4 The order of quotes within pairs was randomized. Im-portantly, because we wanted to understand whether the language of the quotes by itself contains signals about memorability, we chose quotes from movies that the subjects said they had not seen. (This means that each subject saw a different set of quotes.) Moreover, the subjects were requested not to consult any external sources of information. 5 The reader is welcome to try a demo version of the task at http:
Table 2 shows that all the subjects performed (sometimes much) better than chance, and against the null hypothesis that all subjects are guessing ran-domly, the results are statistically significant, p &lt; 2  X  6  X  . 016 . These preliminary findings provide ev-idence for the validity of our task: despite the appar-ent difficulty of the job, even humans who haven X  X  seen the movie in question can recover our IMDb-induced labels with some reliability. 6 2.3 Incorporating search engine counts Thus far we have discussed a dataset in which mem-orability is determined through an explicit label-ing drawn from the IMDb. Given the  X  X roduc-tion X  aspect of memorability discussed in  X  1, we should also expect that memorable quotes will tend to appear more extensively on Web pages than non-memorable quotes; note that incorporating this in-sight makes it possible to use the (implicit) judg-ments of a much larger number of people than are represented by the IMDb database. It therefore makes sense to try using search-engine result counts as a second indication of memorability.

We experimented with several ways of construct-ing memorability information from search-engine counts, but this proved challenging. Searching for a quote as a stand-alone phrase runs into the prob-lem that a number of quotes are also sentences that people use without the movie in mind, and so high counts for such quotes do not testify to the phrase X  X  status as a memorable quote from the movie. On the other hand, searching for the quote in a Boolean conjunction with the movie X  X  title discards most of these uses, but also eliminates a large fraction of the appearances on the Web that we want to find: precisely because memorable quotes tend to have widespread cultural usage, people generally don X  X  feel the need to include the movie X  X  title when in-voking them. Finally, since we are dealing with roughly 1000 movies, the result counts vary over an enormous range, from recent blockbusters to movies with relatively small fan bases.

In the end, we found that it was more effective to use the result counts in conjunction with the IMDb labels, so that the counts played the role of an ad-ditional filter rather than a free-standing numerical value. Thus, for each pair ( M, N ) produced using the IMDb methodology above, we searched for each of M and N as quoted expressions in a Boolean con-junction with the title of the movie. We then kept only those pairs for which M (i) produced more than five results in our (quoted, conjoined) search, and (ii) produced at least twice as many results as the cor-responding search for N . We created a version of this filtered dataset using each of Google and Bing, and all the main findings were consistent with the results on the IMDb-only dataset. Thus, in what fol-lows, we will focus on the main IMDb-only dataset, discussing the relationship to the dataset filtered by search engine counts where relevant (in which case we will refer to the +Google dataset). We now discuss experiments that investigate the hy-potheses discussed in  X  1. In particular, we devise methods that can assess the distinctiveness and gen-erality hypotheses and test whether there exists a no-tion of  X  X emorable language X  that operates across domains. In addition, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these hypotheses. 3.1 Distinctiveness One of the hypotheses we examine is whether the use of language in memorable quotes is to some ex-tent unusual. In order to quantify the level of dis-tinctiveness of a quote, we take a language-model approach: we model  X  X ommon language X  using the newswire sections of the Brown corpus [21] 7 , and evaluate how distinctive a quote is by evaluat-ing its likelihood with respect to this model  X  the lower the likelihood, the more distinctive. In or-der to assess different levels of lexical and syntactic distinctiveness, we employ a total of six Laplace-smoothed 8 language models: 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram word LMs and 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram part-of-speech 9 LMs.

We find strong evidence that from a lexical per-spective, memorable quotes are more distinctive than their non-memorable counterparts. As indi-cated in Table 3, for each of our lexical  X  X ommon language X  models, in about 60% of the quote pairs, the memorable quote is more distinctive.

Interestingly, the reverse is true when it comes to syntax: memorable quotes appear to follow the syn-tactic patterns of  X  X ommon language X  as closely as or more closely than non-memorable quotes. To-gether, these results suggest that memorable quotes consist of unusual word sequences built on common syntactic scaffolding. 3.2 Generality Another of our hypotheses is that memorable quotes are easier to use outside the specific context in which they were uttered  X  that is, more  X  X ortable X   X  and therefore exhibit fewer terms that refer to those set-tings. We use the following syntactic properties as proxies for the generality of a quote:  X  Fewer 3 rd -person pronouns , since these com- X  More indefinite articles like a and an , since  X  Fewer past tense verbs and more present
Table 4 gives the results for each of these four metrics  X  in each case, we show the percentage of quote pairs for which the memorable quote scores better on the generality metric.

Note that because the issue of generality is a com-plex one for which there is no straightforward single metric, our approach here is based on several prox-ies for generality, considered independently; yet, as the results show, all of these point in a consistent direction. It is an interesting open question to de-velop richer ways of assessing whether a quote has greater generality, in the sense that people intuitively attribute to memorable quotes. 3.3  X  X emorable X  language beyond movies One of the motivating questions in our analysis is whether there are general principles underlying  X  X emorable language. X  The results thus far suggest potential families of such principles. A further ques-tion in this direction is whether the notion of mem-orability can be extended across different domains, and for this we collected (and distribute on our web-site) 431 phrases that were explicitly designed to be memorable: advertising slogans (e.g.,  X  X uality never goes out of style. X ). The focus on slogans is also in keeping with one of the initial motivations in studying memorability, namely, marketing appli-cations  X  in other words, assessing whether a pro-posed slogan has features that are consistent with memorable text.

The fact that it X  X  not clear how to construct a col-lection of  X  X on-memorable X  counterparts to slogans appears to pose a technical challenge. However, we can still use a language-modeling approach to as-sess whether the textual properties of the slogans are closer to the memorable movie quotes (as one would conjecture) or to the non-memorable movie quotes. Specifically, we train one language model on memo-rable quotes and another on non-memorable quotes and compare how likely each slogan is to be pro-duced according to these two models. As shown in the middle column of Table 5, we find that slogans are better predicted both lexically and syntactically by the former model. This result thus offers evi-dence for a concept of  X  X emorable language X  that can be applied beyond a single domain.

We also note that the higher likelihood of slogans under a  X  X emorable language X  model is not simply occurring for the trivial reason that this model pre-dicts all other large bodies of text better. In partic-ular, the newswire section of the Brown corpus is predicted better at the lexical level by the language model trained on non-memorable quotes.

Finally, Table 6 shows that slogans employ gen-eral language, in the sense that for each of our generality metrics, we see a slogans/memorable-quotes/non-memorable quotes spectrum. 3.4 Prediction task We now show how the principles discussed above can provide features for a basic prediction task, cor-responding to the task in our human pilot study: given a pair of quotes, identify the memorable one.
Our first formulation of the prediction task uses a standard bag-of-words model 10 . If there were no information in the textual content of a quote to determine whether it were memorable, then an SVM employing bag-of-words features should per-form no better than chance. Instead, though, it ob-tains 59.67% (10-fold cross-validation) accuracy, as shown in Table 7. We then develop models using features based on the measures formulated earlier in this section: generality measures (the four listed in Table 4); distinctiveness measures (likelihood ac-cording to 1, 2, and 3-gram  X  X ommon language X  models at the lexical and part-of-speech level for each quote in the pair, their differences, and pair-wise comparisons between them); and similarity-to-slogans measures (likelihood according to 1, 2, and 3-gram slogan-language models at the lexical and part-of-speech level for each quote in the pair, their differences, and pairwise comparisons between them).

Even a relatively small number of distinctive-ness features, on their own, improve significantly over the much larger bag-of-words model. When we include additional features based on generality and language-model features measuring similarity to slogans, the performance improves further (last line of Table 7).

Thus, the main conclusion from these prediction tasks is that abstracting notions such as distinctive-ness and generality can produce relatively stream-lined models that outperform much heavier-weight bag-of-words models, and can suggest steps toward approaching the performance of human judges who  X  very much unlike our system  X  have the full cul-tural context in which movies occur at their disposal. 3.5 Other characteristics We also made some auxiliary observations that may be of interest. Specifically, we find differences in let-ter and sound distribution (e.g., memorable quotes  X  after curse-word removal  X  use significantly more  X  X ront sounds X  (labials or front vowels such as represented by the letter i ) and significantly fewer  X  X ack sounds X  such as the one represented by u ), 11 word complexity (e.g., memorable quotes use words with significantly more syllables) and phrase com-plexity (e.g., memorable quotes use fewer coordi-nating conjunctions). The latter two are in line with our distinctiveness hypothesis. How an item X  X  linguistic form affects the reaction it generates has been studied in several contexts, in-cluding evaluations of product reviews [9], political speeches [12], on-line posts [13], scientific papers [14], and retweeting of Twitter posts [36]. We use a different set of features, abstracting the notions of distinctiveness and generality, in order to focus on these higher-level aspects of phrasing rather than on particular lower-level features.

Related to our interest in distinctiveness, work in advertising research has studied the effect of syntac-tic complexity on recognition and recall of slogans [5, 6, 24]. There may also be connections to Von Restorff X  X  isolation effect Hunt [17], which asserts that when all but one item in a list are similar in some way, memory for the different item is enhanced.
Related to our interest in generality, Knapp et al. [20] surveyed subjects regarding memorable mes-sages or pieces of advice they had received, finding that the ability to be applied to multiple concrete sit-uations was an important factor.

Memorability, although distinct from  X  X emoriz-ability X , relates to short-and long-term recall. Thorn and Page [34] survey sub-lexical, lexical, and se-mantic attributes affecting short-term memorability of lexical items. Studies of verbatim recall have also considered the task of distinguishing an exact quote from close paraphrases [3]. Investigations of long-term recall have included studies of culturally signif-icant passages of text [29] and findings regarding the effect of rhetorical devices of alliterative [4],  X  X hyth-mic, poetic, and thematic constraints X  [18, 26].
Finally, there are complex connections between humor and memory [32], which may lead to interac-tions with computational humor recognition [25]. Motivated by the broad question of what kinds of in-formation achieve widespread public awareness, we studied the the effect of phrasing on a quote X  X  mem-orability. A challenge is that quotes differ not only in how they are worded, but also in who said them and under what circumstances; to deal with this dif-ficulty, we constructed a controlled corpus of movie quotes in which lines deemed memorable are paired with non-memorable lines spoken by the same char-acter at approximately the same point in the same movie. After controlling for context and situation, memorable quotes were still found to exhibit, on av-erage (there will always be individual exceptions), significant differences from non-memorable quotes in several important respects, including measures capturing distinctiveness and generality. Our ex-periments with slogans show how the principles we identify can extend to a different domain.

Future work may lead to applications in market-ing, advertising and education [4]. Moreover, the subtle nature of memorability, and its connection to research in psychology, suggests a range of further research directions. We believe that the framework developed here can serve as the basis for further computational studies of the process by which infor-mation takes hold in the public consciousness, and the role that language effects play in this process.
