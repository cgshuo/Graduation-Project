 Figure 8. Activation of all the slices using one of the (natural image) bases. This figure clearly shows high corelations of a feature in few consecutive slices. This is an artifact of slice X  X y X  X lice treatment during feature extraction. Figure 9. Activation of the median (34 th ) slice using all the (natural image) bases. This figure shows how di  X  erent bases have higher activations (shown in red) around di  X  erent areas of brain supposed to be filled with cerebrospinal fluid. By applying max-pooling, we captured some sort of markers leading to high diagnostic accuracy. Given that we have 100
