 In online collaborative communities such as open source software development, people often encounter unknown others who they must work with in the absence of any previous interaction or formal organizational relationship. These settings are increasingly supported by social networking systems that provide detailed information about individuals X  activities and behaviors. My research focuses on understanding h ow individuals form impressions of others in work environments supported by social media, and how these impressions influence collaborative outcomes . H5 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Miscellaneous Impression formation, open source development, peer production In peer production and other collaborative communities, participants may be located all over the world and often must interact with individuals they have not previously met and with whom they do not share a common organizational context. As social network functionalities (like interest networks and activity feeds) are tied with online work environments in these communities, participants are exposed to more and more cues and traces about these new colleagues X  work activities and communication interactions. However, it is unclear how these traces influence the impressions they form about these collaborators, and how viewing these traces influences work outcomes. In online interactions, people form impressions about each other based on limited information. These impressions shape the way they interact and relate to each other. Negative or inaccurate first impressions may be hard to change and can lead to undesirable outcomes such as relational conflict and delays. While much work has been done on interpersonal impression formation in settings such as online dating and friendship formation, less is known about how people form impressions of others in an online work setting. My work extends what is known about impression formation and online interpersonal interactions in other domains to a complex and large-scale distributed work context where social media support lightweight ways of sharing information about others X  behaviors and actions . Drawing from social science theories relating to social cognition and subjective distance in distributed teams , I consider how increasingly detailed behavior traces influence impression formation. My research brings literature and theory on social cognition together with advances in social technology design to understand and support impression formation in a complex distributed work context. Individuals involved in large-scale peer production communities such as open source software development often initially lack detailed information about each other X  X  contexts, personalities, and expertise. This lack of cues may lead to a greater feeling of psychological distance from their collaborators [1] and can negatively affect satisfaction with relationships, learning from distant colleagues, and desire to work together again [3]. Wilson et al. [1] propose that organizational, task, individual, and social factors may all influence perceived distance among distributed team members. In my research, I focus specifically on the influence of social factors on impression formation, attitudes, and behaviors towards remote colleagues. I focus particularly on the early stages of impression formation in order to see how initial impressions are shaped by social technology design before direct interactions occur, and how these initial impressions affect subsequent working behaviors . The uncertainty reduction theory of impression formation suggests that individuals form impressions of others, whether meeting face to face or in a computer mediated context, to help reduce uncertainty about how someone will behav e in the future and to decide whether or not to pursue further interactions. Providing different types of information about a person or their context could theoretically influence the relationship in different ways. For example, information about an individual X  X  personality, interests, or context could lead to feelings of interpersonal closeness, while information about their work behaviors could influence impressions of expertise or skill. Thus far, I have focus ed specifically the impact of viewing traces of work and interaction history, which, in the absence of synchronous communication, may help distant collaborators to form more detailed impressions of each other, reduce psychological distance and improve the collaboration process. An important aspect of person perception in distributed work is impressions of teammate s X  skills, abilities and personalities. Psychological distance also affects the impression formation process by influencing how perceivers construe behavioral information about another person [2]. In many distributed work settings, team members initially do not have sufficient personal knowledge of each other X  X  past behavior to accurately assess their abilities. Instead, they view people as members of a category rather than assessing their individual behaviors [1]. While this can be an efficient way of processing information, it can backfire if the initial impression is negative or inaccurate. Increasingly, online peer production communities like GitHub are incorporating social media functionalities that let users view the actions and interactions of unknown developers. By providing more concrete information about individuals X  expertise and past behaviors, it may be possible to reduce psychological distance and help people form more accurate impressions of each other . However, we do not yet understand how, when, or why users form impressions of each other in workspaces instrumented with social media functionality and how these impressions influence the work that is don e. To investigate these questions, I have conducted a qualitativ e study of impression formation in GitHub. This study involved interviews with a number of GitHub project owners asking them about 1) when they have consulted the profiles of unknown others contributing code to projects they own on the site, 2) what cues they have attended to on these profiles and 3) what impressions they have formed about these contributors based on these cues. To understand the influence of impressions on the work process, I have examined a series of case studies around specific cod e-based interactions mentioned by interviewees, looking at the role of profile -based impressions on outcomes such as code acceptance and relational conflict. With respect to scenarios in which developers were likely to consult other members  X  profiles, t hree main motivations emerged from the interviews. These included discovery and exploration of new people and projects (independent of any direct interaction with the person,) forming expectation s about the skills of people submitting pull requests (code contributions) to the owner X  X  project, and informing interactions with these contributors. The second research question focused on which cues people attended to on GitHub profiles and on how they used these cues to form impression s about others. We found that profile cues such as amount of activity, type of projects, type of contributions, and specific aspects of coding style were used to assess a user X  s general coding abilities and specific areas of expertise . Trac es of previous discussions with others on the site were sometimes used to get a feel for what a person would be like to interact with. Overall, the results indicate that users in this setting seek out additional information about each other to explore the project space, inform interactions around contributed code, and understand the potential future value of a new contributor to their project . They form impressions of other users X  expertise based on their history of activity across projects, and success ful collaborations with key high status projects in the community. The interviews also asked people to identify recent cases in which they had received a pull request (request to commit code to a proj ect) from a contributor w ith whom they were not familiar and who they had never worked with before . This process is important because it is the primary way open source projects attract new contributors and extend their code base. Interviewees described w hat happened in the pull request process and their interactions with the submitter (including whether or not they viewed that person X  X  profile.) We focused on the following key outcomes associated with a pull request interaction in light of the previous work on software development and project success: whether the contribution was accepted, how long the exchange took, and whether conflict arose in the process. Based on the pull request case studies, we found that profile information was not necessarily u seful in cases where the value and benefit of the code contribution was evident. However, when the code was problematic and not immediately acceptable, some developers used the contributors X  profiles to form quick impressions of their abilities and attitud es, which then helped them to form a cost -benefit analysis guiding further interaction. For example, the cost of working with someone to fix their code so that it could be accepted (which could be high in cases where contributors were newcomers or novices ) was weighed against the potential benefits of helping to mentor a new project member who could contribute in the future, or the risks of being annoyed by time consuming arguments with a novice about why their contribution was not acceptable. Cues leading to the formation of negative impressions of e xpertise when the contributor was a novice could be diminished by other cues indicating they we re worthy of mentoring. However, one obstacle preventing many project owners working on large projects f rom attending to profile cues is that the process req uires time and effort . Thus far, I have gained a better understanding of factors that influence the impression formation process for open source software developers based on the cues and activity traces that are provided in the GitHub environment . In the future , I plan to examine the impression formation proc ess in other large -scale collaborative and creative environments to see how the process is similar and different in varied contexts that provide different types of behavior and activity traces. I will then use these findings to inform and e valuate interventions designed to improve the impression formation process ( e.g. , by investigating new ways of presenting information about other users X  relevant attributes, such as work history, expertise, and interaction style. ) For example, the interv iews with GitHub users have provided implications for the design of better summaries of individuals X  activity and skills that can be more effective in allowing project owners to quickly and effectively assess new contributors prior to interacting with them . These summaries may also be supplemented by more information about a person X  X  work history and /or details regarding their location (a topic investigated in [1] .) Overall, I am interested in theoretically and empirically informing the design of simple, lightweight asynchronous interventions to help people learn about each other more ef ficiently and accurately, thereby reducing psychological distance and improving both task -related and social outcomes in large scale collaborative environments.
