 and AI community have been focused on developing image and video analysis and understanding. However, despite their extensive efforts on these, there are still several significant challenges such as robust object segmentation and tracking, motion feature extraction, context modeling, and machine learning algorithms. Therefore, more advanced related issues should be taken into account. We have selected nine research papers whose topics are strongly related to the intelligent surveillance system in smart home environment. 1. Introduction services for human and promotes to the application technologies of innovation industry. The applicat ion technologies include multiple sensors (such as wireless sensor network, microphone, ultrasonic, infrared rays and pressure), human i nterface machine (such as touch panel, image/voice recognitions a nd remote control), internet ser-vices, smart devices and access monitoring. It is an important issue how to integrate and manage with a ll devices and heterogeneous networks.
 improved image processing technologies, intelligent surveillance system has become one of rapidly emerging applications in smart home environment. Traditional closed-circuit television (CCTV) requires a relative small amount of operators to continuously monitor a significant number of cameras in areas which need security, such as military installations, roads, and airports. Intelligent surveillance systems can provide automated services such as abrupt incursion detection, shortest path recommend ation using traffic jam analysis, robbery monitoring, and people counting. During the last decades, many researchers in image processing and AI community have been focused on developing image and video analysis and understanding.
However, despite their extensive efforts on these, there are still several significant challenges su ch as robust object segmentation streaming while the network is congested. P-R 2 CP is a cross-layer protocol that considers both the transport-layer issues and the media content X  X  properties in application-layer.

The fourth paper entitled  X  X  X tatistical Skin Color Detection Method without Color Transformation for Real-Time Surveillance Systems, X  X  by Chen et al. (2012) develop a statistical skin color model using the default RGB color space, which is especially suitable to implement on hardware for image processing app lications. An efficient face detec-tion system is also presented with the proposed skin color model for hardware implementation.

The fifth paper entitled  X  X  X otion detection with pyramid struc-ture of background model for intelligent surveillance systems, X  X  by Huang and Cheng (2012) propose a pyramidal background matching structure for motion detection. The proposed method utilizes spectral, spatial, and temporal features to generate a pyramidal structure of the background model. After performing the back-ground subtraction based on the proposed background model, the moving targets can be accurately detected at each frame of the video sequence. In order to produce high accuracy for the motion detec-tion, the proposed method also further includes a noise filter based on the Bezier curve to smooth noise pixels, after which the binary motion mask can be computed by the proposed threshold function.
Next paper entitled  X  X  X daptive fra me synchronization for surveil-lance system across a heterogeneous network, X  X  by Leu et al. (2012) propose an adaptive frame synchr onization mechanism for frame capturing at cameras based on the network condition to improve the frame synchronization between two sides across a heterogeneous network. Based on a brief theoretical analysis of the asynchronization effect for video communication in a heterogeneous network environ-ment, the proposed adaptive pause time mechanism can be an effective solution to relieve the asynchronization effect in the unmatched transmission rate situation.

The seventh paper entitled  X  X  X  Service Scenario Generation Scheme based on Association Rule Mining for Elderly Surveillance System on a Smart Home Environment, X  X  by Kim et al. Kang et al. (2012) propose a scheme for translating associat ion rules among appliances mined from their usage information into service scenarios. After showing that the existing algorithms are limited in improving the usefulness of association rule generation by means of adjusting the confidence level due to such unique characteris tics, they propose a new service scenario generation scheme which calculates the confidence level based on hypothesis testing. This paper also demonstrates that association rule mining based on the dependence between appliances is feasible and its performance is very much comparable with that of an existing association rule mining algorithm.
 The eighth paper entitled  X  X  X ire Flame Detection in Video Sequences using Multi-Stage Pattern Recognition Techniques, X  X  by Kim et al. propose an effective technique that is used to automatically detect fire in video images. The proposed algorithm is composed of four stages: (1) an adaptive Gaussian mixture model to detect moving regions;(2) a fuzzy c -means (FCM) algorithm to segment the candidate fire regions from these moving regions based on the color of fire; (3) special parameters extracted based on the tempo-spatial characteristics of fire regions; and (4) a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm using these special parameters to distinguish between fire and non-fire.
The last paper entitled  X  X  X ocal Feature-based Multi-Object Recog-nition Scheme for Surveillance, X  X  by Kim et al. (2012) propose an efficient multi-object recognition scheme for surveillance based on interest points of objects and their feature descriptors. In this scheme, they first define a set of object types of interest and collect their sample images. For each sample image, they detect interest points and construct their feature descriptors using SURF. Next, they per-form a statistical analysis of the local features to select representative
