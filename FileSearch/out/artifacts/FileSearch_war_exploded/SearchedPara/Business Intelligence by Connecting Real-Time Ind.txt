 and adopted including GPS, RFID, UWB, acoustic based, cellular based, WLAN based and many more. A good summary of existing techniques considering both reso-lution and scale of application can be found in [1]. Retail among all has been the most mature industry where Indoor Location Based Services (ILBS) have flourished. Play-ers in this field range from start-ups to MNCs. The ability to weave consumer location context into browsing, social sharing and buying activities is the common mandate of ILBS, which presumably will have more potential to drive online clicks into increased become an inseparable part of behavior based personalization in mobile marketing &amp; commerce. signal strength triangulation considering constraints such as cost and coverage. Through the POC development we found the accuracy of collected in door location coordinates to be limited and unstable. Accord ing to available references such as [2], changes in settings and customer crowds attenuated the signal sensing. We have therefore applied Bayesian smoothing which was able to reduce data jumping but not quite significantly. 
A mobile app was developed for the POC and rolled out in a small scale to connect customer location data with their loyalty status (member or non-member) and the retailer X  X  product sales. Through this research attempt we have discovered certain less communicated aspects of LBS namely the lack of accuracy, the response time lag, and during its test implementation in the week of Great Singapore Sales in year 2013. In general, GPS, signal strength triangulation via Cell Tower locating, Wi-Fi network, BLE (Bluetooth low energy), scanning of RFID (radio frequency identification), UWB (ultra wideband), mapping of Magnetic Field, and processing of video content are some of the technologies adopted in indoor LBS applications. For those interested in details of these technologies such as locating accuracy and setup effort, [1], [2] and [4] can be referred to. We have selected Wi -Fi signal triangulation considering cost of implementation and the ease of scaling up. 
Six Wi-Fi access points and one master router for signal strength triangulation were implemented in our retail business partner X  X  physical store.

They communicated with one another through the 5GHz Wi-Fi spectrum. Data generated were passed to cloud server via 3G mobile broadband network every a few illustration only and not exact to the scales. 
Before setting up the Wi-Fi infrastructure to do signal fingerprinting, we tried also built-in sensors in smartphone including GPS, compass and accelerometer for location from these sensors to make any sense. BLE (Bluetooth low energy) was tested as well during scoping phase. Reports said Apple has been working on the retrieval of micro locations through iBeaco n which in essence is BLE locating [10]. It was dropped out Bluetooth option of their smartphones for a prolonged period of time.

However when the size of on-site crowd increased, the improvement in accuracy became less satisfying. Literatures such as [3] and [4] provide good readings of real world application scena-retail venue hosting multiple branded counters.

It is one of the most mobile savvy popu-summarized in next section. First of all, we have found the achieved locating accuracy comparable to commercial grade products as reported by established providers such as Motorola Solutions data consumption through Wi-Fi network. The Bayesian smoothing had not signifi-crowd. The crowd attenuated the Wi-Fi signal strength in all different directions. Also effective link node models for drawing of Bayesian inferences. 
Secondly, the time lag for access points to pick up the Wi-Fi signal search from in-dividual smartphones varied from 1 to 10 minutes. This complicated the accuracy issue further more and led to larger location bias. The users using the navigation app did move, it jumped from place to place. The good news was the time lag and location for longer than 10 minutes received the marketing push notification. For users merely walking by, the chance decreased to around 50%. 
Considering both time lag and location bias, the location based crow behavior ana-lytics were found with low credibility in real time. However the accumulated statistics over a certain amount of time such as an hour or a day become more reliable and in-15th of July 2013. Different line types/colors are used for different branded counters. tracting onsite consumers in the first 2 weeks of June which coincided with the week of Great Singapore Sale, especially when compared to  X  X rand B X  represented by the rest of time window. 
When we combined the above footfall data with the number of sales from the 2 mentioned brands to compute the Conversion Rate, which is Number of Deals divided customers. 
In addition we have tried to mash up the amount of dwell time with the amount of money spent for selected brands, as illustrat ed in Figure 4. The correlation coefficient was found slightly larger than 0.5. 
Last but not the least we have done a survey with the retail partner to conclude the research. The feedbacks can be summarized as: (1) Mobile ILBS for end consumers are attractive but there is lack of evidence in the tracked conversion rate. (2) The mi-cro location based crowd behavior report is considered less useful than the tracking of users. (3) The business user prefers monthly subscription of above reports instead of owning and viewing of the real time location data. Through this research effort we have come to a better understanding about the differ-Both have been elaborated in previous ch apters.

Wh ile the overall percentage of smartphone owners who have used Location Service is quite high  X  74% as reported in FactBrowser in year 2013, prolonged activation of it for non-outdoor navigation pur-poses is actually rare. 
One reason behind such reluctance is people are wary of battery drain. GPS chip requires the biggest power consumption among all mobile sensors. Although experts have claimed the location based reminders consume less power than commonly as-sumed because they request less accurate information and query less frequently than navigation, most smartphone owners prefer to turn off the Location Service option to save power. The same concern is held towards the Bluetooth option and Wi-Fi option. vantage of Wi-Fi signal strength triangulation. 
Another contributing factor is the privac y concern and it is becoming increasingly prominent. Criticisms towards the possibility of revealing uniquely identifiable data in social sharing activities have never stopped. Their influence gradually shows both in country level regulations and individual level conversations. For the mobile phone users we have come across in this research project  X  from C-level users in their 50s to interns in their early 20s -all responded that they only checked in locations via mobile make sure the Wi-Fi option of their smartphones is turned off when not in use. 
Tero Kuittinen [11] has cautioned that privacy concern could kill the mobile LBS enable LBS and mobile phone users X  overall attitude towards location sharing, we tend to agree the limitations of LBS applications are still too many for them to make great market impact or drive noticeable behavior change. 
Nevertheless, meaningful business intelligence can be generated by combining real time location footfalls with sales record, such as the inference of Conversion Rate. It possible without connecting the real time non-transactional data to transactional sales database.
