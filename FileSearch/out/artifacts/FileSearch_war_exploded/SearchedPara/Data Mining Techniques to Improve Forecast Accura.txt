Optimization of the expected net revenue on future flights is one of the main issues in the airline business. The net revenue is here defined as the revenue generated from sold seats minus the costs of denied boardings and excess capacity like empty seats. In order to maximize the revenue from sold seats, a variety of fares (differentiated in terms of service amenities and travel restric-tions) are grouped in booking classes. Statistical models are applied to historical booking data (data from previous departures of the same flights) to estimate the seat demand for each booking class on future flights. The demand forecast is used to determine the number of seats in each booking class that is made available for sale. The lower priced seats have to be limited and more expensive seats have to be protected for briefly before departure booking passengers. This enables the airline to avoid that low priced booking classes are purchased by passengers who are willing to pay a higher price, and to ensure that seats that are expected to go out unsold are available at a lower price to passengers who would otherwise not travel. 
For optimization of the expected net revenue, an accurate forecast of cancellations and so-called no-show passengers is essential. 
No-shows are passengers who hold a valid booking, but do not appear at the gate to board for the flight. In contrast to cancellations, no-shows give no notice that they will not occupy a seat on the aircraft. To reduce the risk of unnecessarily empty seats, the flights are typically overbooked (number of seats available for sale is higher than the physical capacity of the aircraft). An optimized overbooking rate leads to reduced expenses due to denied boardings and to reduced revenue loss due to seats that are not sold although there is a demand for those seats. 
The current forecast method is in the following called 'standard method'. The average show-up rate s for each booking class b is determined as 
B(b) is the observed number of boarded passengers in booking class b on the applicable historical flights, and S(b) is the according number of seats sold (observed number of valid bookings a few hours prior to departure) on the considered historical flights. At any time during the booking period (from 331 days to -1 day before departure), the number of passengers It is w(b,t) = 0 when the predicted number of retaining bookings is equal to the estimated seat demand, and w(b,0 is negative when the predicted number of retaining bookings is larger than the estimated seat demand. Whenever a customer books a flight, a PNR is generated. The PNR can contain more than one flight, as well as more than one passenger. A sequence of flights that build an itinerary is stored in the same PNR. Each time a customer contacts the airline in order to change the state of the booking (confirmation, cancellation, etc.), an additional transaction record is written into the PNR and stored in the reservation system. Every transaction record can be identified by its creation time. If one of the passengers in a PNR decides to change the itinerary, then the PNR is split, i.e. a new PNR is generated for those passengers who changed minds. The information stored in a PNR gives a detailed overview of the booking history and allows to extract a variety of information on the passenger characteristics and the travel purpose (see Table 1). When a passenger holding a valid booking does not show up at the gate to board for the flight, a post departure transaction record is also written into the PNR, stating that the passenger is a no-show. This post departure record is transformed in a binary variable that is used as the target for modeling the noshow probability. Similarly, a binary attribute that reflects whether a passenger has cancelled the flight or not, is used as the target variable for modeling the cancellation probability of a passenger. The PNR data is transferred from the reservation system to a data warehouse from where it can be accessed. In this study, two random samples of PNRs were used as training and test data. The PNRs of both data samples were created in the time period between 28.09.98 and 08.11.00, the departure date of the corresponding segments 1 is from 01.10.98 to 18.09.01. All transaction records are preprocessed in order to create meaningful attributes. Together with attributes that are directly available from the PNRs, the generated attributes serve as explanatory variables for modeling no-show as well as cancellation probabilities (Table 1). The preprocessed data include only the latest transaction record for each booked segment in a PNR, and a variety of attributes to characterize the passenger behavior. Preprocessed training and test data samples consist of a total of 251 '000 and 141 '000 records, respectively. Figure 1 gives an example of the univariate visualization of the influence of one of the available attributes (booking time) on the observed no-show frequency. 1 The connection between two cities that can be booked on the same aircraft (one flight number) is called a segment. Using the balanced training data sample, a large classification tree was grown by allowing small sized terminal nodes. In a next step, the derived classification tree is pruned backwards in order to account for over-fitting, i.e. the possibility that the splitting rules are adapted to well to the training sample. Backward pruning is done by cross-validation. The training sample is split into 2 equally sized parts. One part is used to grow the tree, the second part is used to test it, and vice versa. This is done ten times, and the results are averaged. Backward pruning by cross-validation suggest, that a classification tree with six terminal nodes is sufficient. However, larger trees are still interpretable from the business point of view. The classification tree was therefore only pruned back to size 15. The probability that a passenger in a record of the balanced training sample turns out to be a no-show (Pl) can be estimated from the number of records with ns= 1 and the number of records with ns=0 in the corresponding terminal node. It is given by where not and nlt are the number of records with ns=0 and ns=l in terminal node t, respectively. N O and N 1 are the numbers of records with ns=0 and ns=l in the unbalanced data sample. variable selection. Similar to Figure 2, Figure 3 shows the comparison between the observed no-show frequency in the test data set and predicted no-show probability derived with a logistic regression model that includes only main effects. A logistic regression model that includes interaction effects was also specified, the results are very similar to the main effect model. The comparison between observed no-show frequencies and estimated probabilities agrees well for both methods. However, the logistic regression model covers a much wider range of probabilities than the classification tree. In contrast to the derived classification tree, the logistic regression model allows to identify groups of passengers that have very high no-show probabilities (_&gt; 20%). The same situation is also found when classification trees and logistic regression are applied to estimate cancellation probabilities. We therefore prefer the logistic regression approach to build the final predictive models. Figure 2: Individual no-show probabilities estimated by application of the derived classification rules on the test data sample were grouped into probability classes. Shown is the average observed no-show frequency of the passengers in each probability class. show forecast obtained by the standard method. In this comparison, the forecast is done on flight level rather than on booking class level. Figure 4 shows the result of the model comparison in terms of a measure denoted as the average improvement. The average improvement for a number of N test flights is defined as with rli the observed number of no-shows for flight i. A positive average improvement means, that the average deviation of model and observation is smaller for the blending model than for the standard method. The average difference of the forecast accuracy of the two methods is expressed as the number of more accurately predicted no-shows per 100 passengers. As shown in Figure 4, the average improvement for the test flights (N=42) is positive for forecasts made during the time between 60 and 1 days before departure. The no-show forecasts with the blending model are therefore superior to the forecasts using the standard method. It can also be seen that the average improvement is increasing for short-term forecasts. Long time before departure the number of bookings is small and the blending model is therefore dominated by the standard method (see section 3). As a consequence, the average improvement is close to zero. For short-term forecasts, the number of bookings is approaching the estimated seat demand, and the influence of the standard method in the blending model is decreasing. For the considered test flights, the PNR-based blending model leads to an average improvement of the short-term forecast (1 to 14 days before departure) that can be expressed as about 1 no-show per 100 passengers. This means that for every 100 passengers on fully booked flights, on average either one extra seat can be sold or one denied boarding can be avoided by replacing the standard method by the more accurate blending model. The accuracy of no-show forecasts can be improved when individual passenger information extracted from passenger name records (PNRs) is used as input. For a certain segment, the improvement of the PNR-based approach depends on the flight to flight variation of the characteristics of the booked passengers. If the passenger composition is not varying at all, predictive models on PNR level should be equivalent to averaging over historical flights on booking class level (standard method). The difference in forecast accuracy between blending model and standard method is expected to increase with the variation of the passenger composition on the considered segment. In a next step, no-show and cancellation forecast for individual PNRs will be implemented as new metrics in the booking data warehouse, in order to use them for reporting and to gain further experience with the accuracy of the predictive models.
