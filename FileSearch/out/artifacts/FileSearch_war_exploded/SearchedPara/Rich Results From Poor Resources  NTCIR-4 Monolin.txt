INTRODUCTION In addition to Chinese and Japanese, Korean is an Asian language that has significant influence on world politics, trade, economics, science, and technology. English-Korean cross-language IR would therefore be useful to English-speaking people who need to monitor Korean events but ar e not necessarily expert in the language. This article investigates two questions: translation where queries in a source language are translated into the target collection language for retrieval purposes; document tr anslation where the docu ments are translated into a source query language; and a third appr oach where both are translated into an article we focus our attention on translati ng queries to the document language and perform monolingual target language retrieva l to accomplish the CLIR task. Associated with the pivot Chinese-Korean bilingual re trieval are studies of English-Korean and Chinese-English CLIR. Good performance fo r such capability would facilitate English-speaking users to access Korean documents, and for Chinese-speaking users to access English documents. 2004]. Topics are composed of sections such as title, description, narrative, etc. We will report experiments using the title (t) or description (d) sections only. These correspond to short queries of a few words and to medium-length queries of about a sentence. Figure 1 shows how queries (Q), composed of the title (t) or description (d) sections of a topic, are used to retrieve from (vertical arrows) do cument collections (D). Both queries and documents have superscripts describing the language they are expressed in (C for Chinese, E for English, and K for Korean). A concatenation of superscripts such as Q CEK means that these are Korean qu eries that are translated fro m Chinese to English, then from English to Korean. In these experiments, the topic content in different languages is parallel, but the documents are not. They are given systematic run IDs, and are called (see below) English (E-E) and Korean (K-K) monolingual retrievals: Chinese-English (C-E) and English-Korean (E-K) bilingual runs: and Chinese-English-Korean (C-K) pivot bilingual runs: which is summarized in the next section. Evaluation of these experiments shows that the results submitted for NTCIR-4; and poor in the sense described in the following sections). Section 3 describes the translation resources we used; Section 4 concerns Korean text processing; Sections 5, 6, and 7 describe, respectively, the monolingual, direct bilingual, and pivot-cross language experiments and results; Section 8 concludes. 2. PIRCS RETRIEVAL ENGINE We employed our PIRCS (Probabilistic Indexing and Retrieval  X  X omponents-System) [1995; 2000]. Here we summarize its salient properties and also define the meaning of some symbols. Given a query q and a docume nt d from a collection, our basic algorithm assigns retrieval status value (RSV) for d in two ways, which are called q , d k are the within-item (query or document) frequency of term k; L q , L d are the lengths functions that flatten variations at the low and high end of the argument value. Also: collection frequency of term k. If we use x k to count only the presence and absence of a term in a document as 1 or 0 (ignoring frequency), then the document frequency of term k is D k =  X  k x k . [Robertson and Sparck 1976] and on the following assumptions: Information retrieval may be realized by spreading activation (as in neural networks) from query node q to d, or vice versa from document node d to q, both via an intermediate layer of term nodes. Equation (1) means that query q has an S(q k /L q ) amount of term k, which has weight w dk in document d; while Eq. (2) says document d contributions of all connected terms on the document or query node constitutes the two RSV values. In practice, a combination of the two RSVs, (  X  is a constant between 0.5 to 0.7) is more stable, and often more effective, than either of them alone; it is our default formula. The advantage of PIRCS is that it can bootstrap itself (i.e., defines weights for features via se lf-relevance) even at the initial stage without user relevance information, and can account naturally for non-binary features in the probabilistic retrieval framework. It has b een shown that the document-focused RSVd formula can also be cast into a form (after some algebraic manipulation) similar to a simple language model for IR [Hiemstra and Kraaij 1998; Kwok 2000]. This is due to our departure from Robertson and Sparck [1976] in counting conceptual components (single terms in this formulation) rather than documents, leading to the use of collection term frequency F k (instead of document frequency D k ) and the number of tokens in collection N (instead of the number of documents N) in the probabilistic formula (Eq. 3). The ratios d k /L k , F k /N w , which represent a language model X  X  probability of generating term k from a document and the background collection, are therefore captured in w dk . Thus, our approach may also be viewed as combining pr obabilistic retrieval with a language model; Eq. (5) is the basis of our PIRCS ranking formula.
 retrieval for feedback, whether in monolingual or cross-language retrieval, has been shown again and again to be useful in impr oving mean average precision over a set of investigations [Vogt and Cottrell 1999], it was also found that different retrieval that combining these different retrieval lists (data fusion) often provides improved effectiveness. In this investigation, we em ploy different indexing strategies such as bigram-or word-indexing to Asian texts. Combining their retrieval lists is also a technique that we tested re gularly in these experiments.
 3. TRANSLATION RESOURCES translation as corpus-based, dictionary-based , and as MT software. To these we add a fourth, the Web-based category. Some properties of these methods are tabulated in Table 1, where  X  X ranularity X  refers to the size of a translation unit;  X  X apping X  is a measure of quantitative estimate of the quality of a paired bilingual mapping.  X  X ser control X  indicates whether a user has the ability to influence or disambiguate the translation output. With corpus-based method [e.g. Xu and Weischedel 2000], one does lexicon alignment and bilingual pair creation from available parallel texts (or mining of parallel texts from the Web for more up-to-date information). Th is allows complete user control over the probabilities (for instance, via Model 1 [Brown et al. 1990]). With the dictionary-based approach, users employ existing, fixed bilingual dictionaries or lexicon lists to find translation mappings. Some limited weighting can be assigned as in Kwok [2001a] based on dictionary structure. These mappings are normally 1 to m, and users can have control over the output by disambiguation techniques such as using term frequency or correlation information from a target collection. In th is category, we may also include use of existing bilingual classification schemes that may be employed as an intermediate language. Investigators usually consider translation via MT software as less desirable control of output. This is because the purpos e of MT is to generate accurate, grammatical, and readable sentences for human consumption; it is not supposed to have multiple i.e., high for the automatic methods where there is more opportunity for exploitation; low for MT software where control is limited or nonexistent. The Web-based translation category is discussed in Section 3.3. corpus-based or dictionary-based approach is the scarcity of parallel resources. For timeliness, and update issues are seldom discussed. For the better MT systems, however, we could expect market forces to make vendors render their internal dictionaries more accurate and up-to-date. English to Korean for our study of Chinese to Korean pivot bilingual CLIR. Direct for testing in the US. We decided to use commercially available MT software, which may be viewed as a poor man X  X  bilingual dictionary with 1 to 1 mapping and no user control. In general, commercial MT can provide reasonab le translations for general English, but it may not be sufficient for entities or recent te rminology. We augment the translation result with an entity/terminology-oriented Web-ba sed translation methodology developed in-house. to test whether concatenating multiple MT outputs for query translation works better than a single MT output . Our hypothesis is that a combination of MT outputs can bring more robust results. Given a query, assume two separate translations are performed and the two MTs, they may be regarded as  X  X onfirme d, X  and the probability that they are correct is assumed high. They are given a heavier weight, and may improve precision. When translations differ, th ere are three possibilities: (a) there are different synonyms or highly associated terms for the same source term; (b) one term is correct and the other wrong; or (c) both are wrong. The first possibility provides better cove rage and can improve recall. For example, in the case of English-Korean , one MT may provide semantic translation while the other may output transliteration. For the second case, the output provides where both translations are wrong is the wors t situation; it is then better to use only one translation. We assume that concatenating translation output has benefits that can outweigh the cost. In Kwok [2001a] we c oncatenated translations from MT and a bilingual lexicon list in direct English-Chin ese CLIR and improved effectiveness. In Gollins and Sanderson [2001] researchers used  X  X riangulated X  translation through different pivot languages to arrive at the target language by intersecting or merging translation outputs. Their results involve European languages only, and provide performance close to direct CLIR. In this ar ticle we employ two MT routes from Chinese to Korean via the same pivot language, English. We also study additional control over the output from multiple Korean MT suggestions in Section 6.2 . 3.1 Chinese-English MT Software The Systran (http://www.systransoft.com) and Loto (http://www.lotousa.com) software packages were used for Chinese-English translation. Systran has a long history of C-E translation, and offers software with vary ing levels of sophistication. We used the Standard 4.0 version. Loto is new to the US market; it evolved from the Chinese HuaJian English-Chinese MT software. A license to use Loto gives us a stand-alone MT package on a PC, as well as Web access to the company X  X  central translation software. The latter stand-alone version. For these experiments, we used the online translation facility. topic X  X  description section. Included at the end of each query are six additional terms obtained from pretranslation expansion processing from the NTCIR-4 Chinese collection (see Section 6.3). appears from both the segmentation and transl ation points of view acceptable for CLIR. For Chinese to English, these two MT softwa re packages manage to translate all 60 queries with only a few words untranslat ed. Our entity-oriented Web translation (described in Section 3.3) was not used in the C-E experiments. 3.2 English-Korean MT Software In the US, resources for Korean are not as common as for other major languages. For English-Korean, we employed the Systran so ftware X  X  English/CJK capability. We also acquired a package from LniSoft, called EnGuide (http://www.lnisoft.co.kr). These and low status (Table 1). LniSoft has difficulty handling sentences with words that have a capitalized first letter in the middle of a senten ce (which is the case with the title section of the English queries). We overcame this problem by producing two versions of the title section: one with the words all in lower-case; the other with the case information retained, but each word appears on a separate line. below, including untranslated English words picked up by our entity/terminology-oriented translation procedure (Section 3.3). In addition, the Chinese-English translations in Section 3.1 are fed directly into the English-Korean MTs to provide four mappi ngs between Chinese-Ko rean via transitive Section 3.1 is shown below: 3.3 Web-Based Entity/Terminology Translation The MT software described in the last section can provide reasonable translations for general language expressions but may not be sufficient for entities such as names of person or places. Bilingual entity dictionaries vary from very expensive to nonexistent. We implemented a Web-based translation from English to Korean (and Chinese) that is oriented to entity names and terminology [Kwok, et. al. 2005]. It is based on the normal conventions that writers use to express translations in bilingual document fragments in S will contain some kind of translation of S E , or vice versa. We employ Google X  X  word in a query) as key and request output snippets in Korean. These snippets are scanned for the pattern above, and candidates fo r translation are isolated and ranked after some text-processing, noise-filtering, and frequency counts. Patterns are also weighted (according to whether the English key term matches string S E exactly, partially, or minute per query. Because the Web is rich and huge, it is an excellent resource for discovering translations for popular entity names and terminologies and very useful for supplementing a general translation process, and it is applicable to any popular language pairs. with the occurrence frequency indicated in the returned Web snippets. This was not done for query 2 via LniSoft because additional E nglish words were adj acent to  X  X onnie X . To gain precision by Web translation, our procedure regards such a word sequence as an indivisible phrase. Apparently our procedure failed to locate such a phrase. In query 55, the translation for  X  X aepodong X  was not found by our procedure either. During the E-K query translation using Systran and Lni, there were 68 English terms left untranslated out they produced 69 Korean words as a result. 4. KOREAN TEXT PROCESSING AND INDEXING Korean text is written with a blank space as a delimiter, but the character string in between spaces are eojoels that can denote words, compo unds, or phrases [Seo et al. 2004]. For all tasks involving Korean, we employed a simple strategy of overlapping bigram indexing without stemming or stop-word removal as a default. In Section 5.1, we additionally employ simple stemming as preprocessing before bigram formation. We also download a program called HAM version 6.0.0 (http://nlp.kookmin.ac.kr/HAM/kor/ download.html) for the E-K and C-K retrieval tasks. HAM is an acronym for Hangul Analysis Module (or model). It is a Korean lexical analyzer for Hangul (Korean) text. It supports an  X  X ndex X  program that removes suffixes and stop-words and extracts simple nouns and other words from compounds. For our indexing purposes, we kept the simple nouns (previously, verbs and adjectives were also kept) and the original compound nouns. Keeping the compounds allows us to do some phrase indexing and to hedge the outcomes of segmentation. In what follows we call this procedure HAM indexing. 5. MONOLINGUAL RETRIEVAL Monolingual retrieval is the basis of CLIR. T echniques that improve its performance are also beneficial for CLIR. The effectiveness of monolingual retrieva l also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the corresponding CLIR results. In this section, two monolingual retrieval experiments (K-K, E-E) are described. During the NTCIR-4 time summarized using three measures: R% (mean pe rcentage recall of all relevant documents based on a 1000-document retrieval list per query); MAP (mean average precision); and P10 (average precision for 10 retrieved documents). For a topic, NTCIR-4 employs multigrade relevance judgments on the basis of pooled documents: highly relevant S, relevant A, partially relevant B, and not relevant C. If only class S and A documents are considered relevant, the evaluation is called rigid . Evaluations that consider classes S, A, relaxed and rigid assessment columns, each of which shows the total number of relevant documents found (e.g., the K-K rigid judgment has 3131 documents, and includes only those judged highly relevant and relevant ). R% is a percentage of these numbers within the 1000 retrieved documents. 5.1 Korean-Korean Retrieval Since bigram indexing has worked well for Chinese [Kwok 2001b] and Korean retrieval [Lee and Ahn 1996], we used this technique for Korean retrieval without first removing stop-words or stemming; results are shown in Table II. Rows marked  X  X TCIR-4 X  tabulate results obtained during NTCIR-4 blind-retrieval submissions (i.e., when retrieved documents have not yet been judged and relevant answers to each topic are unknown), and unsubmitted runs. The run ID K-K-T-b, for example, means it is K-K submitted run (subm). The tag  X  X  in the next run ID means HAM word indexing, and the tag  X  X w shows results using fusion of the bigram and word retrieval lists. During NTCIR-4, our HAM indexing retained all simple words (including verbs and adjectives), which affected performance adversely by about 4% . Rows marked  X  X ew: X  indicate retrievals for bigram with stemming and HAM that retain only nouns and their compounds. have more of an adverse impact on bigram retrieval than we realized. Korean has its agglutinated. Korean stemming is not simple and requires complicated linguistic analysis, contextual information, and even character changes. Since we did not have a good morphological analysis tool, we decided to experiment with simple stemming by manually creating sets of n-character suffi xes (n=1,2,3; see Appendix 1). These are removed longest-first from the end of each eojoel in the original text before bigram indexing is performed. Stemming without context may sometimes lead to erroneously removing characters from a word or compound . These suffixes are our second  X  X oor X  resource. retrieval (tagged as  X  b2), as well as new HAM word-indexing results. For title queries, run ID K-K-T-b2 has MAP value .4948 (underscored), not much different from K-K-T-b, which does not involve stemming. For description queries however, K-K-D-b2 leads to over 13% improvement in MAP ( relaxed ) over K-K-D-b, from .4049 to .4621. We without many suffixes to trim. For descriptio n queries it is different, and suffixes become noisy index terms. This is contrary to Chin ese retrieval, where stemming is not necessary for bigram indexing. but similar for description queries. Titles are often in good noun forms for retrieval; they do not need text processing which may result in over-stemming. For example, the characters corresponding to  X  X  X  X  X  ( Hu Jinto ) were stemmed to  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  (Kurosawa) to  X  X  X  X  . New noun-indexing improves substantially for description queries compared to word-indexing performed during NTCIR-4. Combining retrieval lists from bigram and word indexing (tag -b2w) helps slightly for title and a lot for description queries. As a reference, the best K-K monolingual MAPs among NTCIR-4 and .4685 (rigid) for description queries. Without HAM indexing, our simple stemming and bigram indexing approach can bring us to within about 10% from these best values. Combined with HAM indexing, retrieval brings us to within 2% of the best values for description queries, but does not help much for titles. character; 1,2: one and two ch aracters; and 1,2,3: one to three characters) can affect bigram MAP values on our submitted monolingual and cross-lingual runs using titles Q K (solid bars), Q EK (cross-hatch), and Q CEK (hollow). For K-K, we can see that the effect of removing 1 to 3 character suffixes on MAP is very small compared to  X  X ubm, X  submitted runs without stemming. When this operation is done asymmetrically on the documents only,  X  X 1,2,3 X  (without stemming the queries), MAP improves 2% to .5066 vs. submitted results of 0.4934. Title queries often consist of nouns without suffixes, and suffix removal based on this simple scheme may lead to erroneous truncations. E-K behaves effect. Trading-off missing suffixes against stemming too much, we chose suffix sets 1,2 as the default for stemming in Table II and  X  X ew X  runs in other tables. 5.2 E-E Monolingual Retrieval E-E monolingual retrieval is recorded here to present new results after the blind experiments and as a measurement basis for CLIR. After NTCIR-4 experimentation, it was discovered that a different command file that used Eq. (1) for retrieval only and ignored the combination with Eq. (2) was used for the submitted run. These E-E experiments were repeated w ith the correct command file for Eq. (5); the results are tabulated below as  X  X ew X  rows . They are about 10% better than the ones submitted, and comparable to some of the best results from participants. In this article, we will use the corrected results as a basis for comparison. 6. BILINGUAL CLIR Bilingual CLIR makes use of one translation from source query to target language. The MT translation sometimes outputs terms that are completely out of context with the source content. This is also observed in dictionary-based mapping when bad errors exist in some dictionary entries. We attempt to disambiguate the concatenated output by removing some of the noisy terms based on word correlations and the two independent translation outputs. This process is not a pplied to bigrams, as correlation between bigrams is not as meaningful as between words. different sizes. Which English source word maps to which Korean target is also unknown. We separate these words into three classes: (a) those that appear in both translation outputs; (b) those that have a high correlation between translations; and (c) the remaining words. Class (a) words are assumed correct because they have been confirmed by both MTs. Class (b) words are determined by evaluating the log-likelihood ratio between synonymous, highly associated. If words k 1i and k 2j have the following occurrence pattern: where +/-denotes whether a term occurs or does not occur in a document. For example, k and k 2j co-occur in c 12 documents, while they occur in c 1 and c 2 documents separately in a collection of size n. Then log-likelihood LR, defined as is interpreted (based on observed data) to mean that k 1i and k 2j are exp(-LR) times more likely to co-occur than to occur independently [Manning and Schutze 1999]. We also tested the  X  2 correlation, but it seems LR works better. Both class (a) and (b) words are kept as correct translation core terms. The remaining words in class (c) are candidates for conceptual outliers which may be quirks due to MT software, and are removed from the concatenated output. 6.1 E-K Bilingual CLIR In our NTCIR-4 E-K blind retrieval, two MT outputs were concatenated to represent a rows labeled  X  X TCIR-4 X  in Table IV confirm our conjecture. Thus, for both title and description retrievals, a vertical comparison shows that runs E-K-T(or D)-sys-lni-web improves over single MT translation via  X  X ys-web or  X  X ni-web in all cases. Horizontal comparisons across columns show that  X  X etri eval combination X  (data fusion) also works moderately for description queries. Thus, ou r submitted description retrieval with MAP 0.3249 ( rigid ) performed better than Systran translation alone (MAP .2823) by more than 15%, and better than bigram indexing alone (MAP .3118) by more than 4%. We also tabulated runs E-K-T(or D)-sys-lni (no Web) without our Web translation. They are entity-oriented Web-based translation is effective and is a substantial improvement for description queries where there are more entity terms. stemming for bigram processing and the effects of combining with HAM noun indexing. Bigram processing after 1-2 character-stemming is a substantial improvement over simple bigram (-b) for desc ription queries and a slight improvement for titles (values the description relax evaluation has .3648; a 2% and 6% improvement over no stemming. HAM noun-only indexing is a substantial improvement over the NTCIR-4 result for description (e.g., relax MAP .3675 vs. .3154), and is a slight improvement for titles, as in KK monolingual. Combination with HAM noun indexing improves results further. These E-K results represent about 76 to77% of m onolingual K-K effectiveness for title queries and 77 to 79% for description queries. translation is not consistent. It leads to a good improvement in MAP (HAM-w) for vs. .3172 rigid ). Similar effects were observed when disambiguated word retrievals are combined with bigram retrievals. In both title and description queries approximately 14-18% of index terms were removed; two examples follow: Disambiguation removed  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  , which include  X  X okyo X  and depressed average precision substantially for this query. 6.2 C-E Bilingual CLIR Chinese-English CLIR is an intermediate step towards pivot C-K bilingual IR via English, but it is analyzed here as a task in itself. Here, source Chinese queries require segmentation first and then translation of the resulting words. Both Systran and Loto MT perform these operations with only a few Chinese words left untranslated. Our Web-based translation was not performed. During NTCIR-4, our submitted runs have pre-translation expansion (ptx) of the Chinese queries via the Chinese collection. After judging relevance , it was found that pretranslation expansion actually led to worse MAP results. Moreover, an error in processing was discovered. In Table V, we present corrected runs without query expansion and new runs with disambiguation. The table shows results using Systran and Loto MT syst ems separately, and confirms that C-&gt;E translation concatenation works better than i ndividual translations. For example, for Systran translation alone. These C-E runs provide about 76% of monolingual description query effectiveness, and 81% to 84% for title queries. description queries where there are more terms, but is slightly worse for titles. During this process, an average of 6-7% terms were re moved from the title and description queries; some examples of terms that were removed follow: Only the word  X  X rushing X  was removed, which was helpful.
 The word  X  X ucleus X  was selected for removal, which was bad for the query. 7. C-K ENGLISH-PIVOT BILINGUAL CLIR The results of our C-K retrieval using Q CEK transitive translation qu eries are tabulated in Table VI, where the Chinese queries were tr anslated into English in two ways, using Systran and Loto, as discussed in Section 2. Th e English outputs were then translated into Korean by Systran and EnGuide, resulting in four Korean mappings for each query. Any English terms left untranslated were processed by our Web-based translation. The final queries were then indexed two ways: bigram (b) and HAM indexing (w) as in E-K. using Loto for C-E and Systran for E-K translations), 0.2554 outperforms the concatenation of the four translations, 0.252 0 (row  X  X +b+c+d X ). But together with the help retrieval combinations, they provide the best MAP values. high percentage of noise for bigram indexing. When simple b2-stemming is performed, MAP results improved substantially (see the New  X  X +b+c+d bigram X  cells) as in previous Korean runs. The disambiguation rows show worse results after translation outliers are removed. Chinese query characters to Hangul via Hanja (our third poor resource). These represent transliterations of the Chinese words in Hangul , and could be missed during C-E-K MT translations. We added these direct CK character-mappings for each query for bigram processing only. The MAP values get another boost  X  for example, title rigid bigram evaluation goes from 0.2580 to 0.2869 ( X +direct Ckmap X  row), and the combined result improves from 0.2688 to 0.2968. While 33 queries improved their average precision by a total of 2.0535, 24 suffered small losses that sum to 0.4583. This could mean that certain terms are expressed as transliterations in documents that are not reflected in the MT translations of the queries. However, th is mapping is peculiar to the Chinese-Korean language pair and not applicable to general pivot CLIR. effectiveness for title and description querie s with CK character-mapping. Without the mapping, effectiveness drops to 58-59%. Using bigram indexing alone results in 62% monolingual for titles, 58-59% for description queries with CK-mapping, and about 55-56% monolingual without the mapping. Thus, HAM noun-indexing retrieval combinations with bigram provide improved results over bigram retrievals alone. MAP values ( rigid ) of 0.3978 and 0.3973, respectively, for title and description queries, using direct C-&gt;K bilingual dictionary translation and PRF from different retrieval schemes. Our best results at 0.2968 (title) and 0.2964 (description) are about 25% worse. But this comparison is not in the same categor y, since Korean words are fairly related to Chinese, and this makes direct translation be tween the two languages more accurate. In Sakai et al. [2004] investigators reported good results for Chinese-English CLIR via Japanese as a pivot language. We conjecture that this scheme is also easier because both the source and pivot are re lated Asian languages. our pivot C-K title with rigid retrieval (MAP=0.2688, without CK-character map) is compared to our K-K monolingual retrieval (MAP=0.4599), 11 queries have average precision values of at least 0.4 deficit, and account for 0.098 (over 50%) of the MAP difference. Out of the 11 queries, 7 faile d due to wrong entity-name or terminology translations at the C-E stage, such as: #2 (Jonnie Walker), #8 (Viagra), #12 (Kurosawa), #34 (Kyoto mixed up with Tokyo), #43 (derivatives), #58 (contactless), and #59 (digitalization). 7.1Analysis of Pivot Bilingual Retrieval In these investigations, queries in different languages have the same conceptual content. E-K retrieval involves a single English to Ko rean translation, while our C-K retrieval involves an additional Chinese to English translation. We analyze how the intermediate pivot English queries function for C-K compared to the original English. It seems natural to assume that if a specific query q CE (English query translated from its original Chinese) returns a poor performance for English retrieval compared to its monolingual q E counterpart (i.e., MAP(q E )-MAP(q CE ) is positive and large), it is likely due to a bad C-&gt;E translation. This query will continue to return poor performance using its q CEK for Korean retrieval in comparison to its corresponding q EK (i.e., MAP(q EK )-MAP(q CEK ), which is also positive and large). To see if this is true, we show in Figure 3 a scatter plot of these differences: MAP(q E )-MAP(q CE ) vs. MAP(q EK )-MAP(q CEK ) for the possible 56 title queries. The MAP differences ar e unnormalized raw values. (+x,+y) quadrant shows 19 of the 31 queries, after the E-&gt;K translation, that continue to perform better for their MAP(q EK ) vs. MAP(q CEK ) comparisons. But the remaining 12 better than MAP(q EK ). This 22% (12/56) of the queries do not follow the assumption discussed earlier. Moreover, there are 10 q CE queries (or 18% of 56) shown in the (-x,-y) quadrant that outperform their corresponding q E . Their q CEK queries continue to out-perform their q EK counterparts. We analyze some of the outliers qualitatively to see why they behave this way. A summary is provided below with the raw data tabulated in Appendix 2. These queries are divided into four groups: English retrieval with q E . If the query C-&gt;E translation involves ordinary English, it may lead to Korean retrieval that is comparable to or outperforms q EK . However, if the query involves entity names or terminology (such as: Jonnie Walker, Dioxin, Griffith Joyner), it can fail completely at the pivot language and continue to produce garbage for q CEK direct E-&gt;K or C-&gt;K translations than via pivot. 8. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION For our Korean-oriented CLIR experiments, we employed relatively poor resources such as commercial MT software, simple stemmi ng for Korean bigram indexing, and Chinese-Korean direct character mapping within the NTCIR-4 environment. To this, we added our Web-based entity-oriented translation and the HAM morphological analysis tool for Korean noun indexing. Relatively rich results have been obtained via our techniques for concatenating translations and data fusion (combining retrieval lists). For example, both considering the difficulty of translating entity/terminology at the C-E stage. bar) denotes retrieval MAP values achieved with bigram indexing alone (with 1-2 character stemming), while series B (cross-h atch) denotes the effectiveness achieved when bigram retrievals are combined with HAM noun-indexing. We can see that this combination is helpful in all cases, but ha s a more pronounced effect for description queries (where there are more terms) than for titles. (horizontal hatch). Series C denotes bigram-only indexing, but augmented with direct Chinese-Korean character mapping, while D denotes C combined with HAM word-indexing results. This mapping is specific to Chinese-Korean and no t applicable for other language pairs. Direct character mappings can result in useful transliterations and augment bigram indexing. Adding these CK character mappings will consistently and noticeably outperform us ing translations alone for bigram indexing. with a combination of bigram and HAM noun -indexing retrieval lists, is consistently effective, and is recommended. Simple stemming (of 1 and 2 character suffixes) before bigram processing is effective and necessary . Simple bigram alone is competitive for short title queries in both monolingual and CL IR retrieval. The morphological analysis tool with the HAM module is useful, provided we keep only noun outputs. English pivot provides reasonable results using MT for C-K CLIR; its effectiveness can be boosted by the use of C-K character maps. When named entities or terminology wordings are corrupted during C-E translation, there is little chance for E-K translation to recover; C-K direct translation would have a better probability of being correct. appropriate translations at th e expense of introducing nois e. In these experiments, concatenation leads to improved results compared to using a single MT. We conjecture that this would also be true for other tran slation sources such as different bilingual dictionaries. Systran MT has an edge over the other packages. Web-based translation for leftover OOV (out-of-vocabulary) terms that are mainly entity names or terminology adds significantly (more than 10%) to our results. Translation disambiguation based on likelihood ratio has not been consistently useful. Selecting translation outliers, like pinpointing salient terms in sentences may be a difficult task. and Chinese retrieval using English as a pivot, and combining dictionary translation with MT software. Identifying translation outliers is useful, and we will explore other methods of disambiguation. We thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions. Peter Deng provided the software for the Web-based translation. APPENDIX
