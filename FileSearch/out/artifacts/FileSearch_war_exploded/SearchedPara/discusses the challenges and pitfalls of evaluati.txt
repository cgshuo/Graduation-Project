 discusses the challenges and pitfalls of evaluation and how to avoid them. She discusses such pitfalls as judg-mental biases, post-rationalizations, and false conclusions.

Because of the number of techniques, the author uses a standard framework to discuss each technique. The framework consists of briefly discussing: (1) areas of application (2) description (3) assumptions for applica-tions (4) perspectives (5) frame of reference for interpretation (6) perils and pitfalls (7) advice and comments and (8) supplementary readings. She uses a set of icons at the beginning of each technique section to describe the usefulness of the technique. The author also discusses when to use a given technique in the system lifecycle.
The Handbook is not designed to be read from start to finish. Rather, it is a reference manual. This is the type of book that one would pull off the shelf if she wanted to get some quick information on a particular technique or evaluation problem. Although the book is useful to a wide audience, it may be particularly beneficial to readers who have little knowledge about evaluation and want an easily understandable reference. However, readers looking at this book to provide insight into evaluation methods, problems, and challenges particular to healthcare will be disappointed. There is actually very little discussion about healthcare related issues. Most of the techniques discussed are general and could be used in a number of domains. The author does provide a number of healthcare informatics references at the end of each technique section for readers. Yet, when we looked at the title we expected it be more closely tied to the healthcare informatics field which it is not.

Overall, we found the Handbook to be a good if general overview of evaluation and different evaluation techniques. We would encourage readers to buy this book especially if they want a reference guide of evalu-ation techniques.

If one desires to know how to evaluate, and when to automate the evaluation process, this book has an answer. Dr. Melody Ivory offers an analytical view of what works in automated evaluation of the Web site. This analysis brings a value added perspective in terms of understanding the invisible Web logs. It comes at a right time when the spider X  X  web has progressively become semantic Web (i.e., a web of intentions, seam-lessly connected, and synchronously networked in the global village).

Two different sets of precursors are today making the Web technically feasible, financially viable and hu-manly useful. First, evident in survival issues including a post-bubble X  X  cautionary attitude but forwarding looking corporate portals, shrinking funds but a need to intensify the Web presence, and a dominating hor-izontal Web but temptations to move towards a vertical Web, etc. Second, visible in the trends that enhance communicability, such as, attempt at mapping the invisible content (p. 31), accountability in Web develop-ment (pp. 46, 56, 97, 108), and benchmarking (p. 58). Incidentally, all of the above reiterates the pressing need for testing the Web infrastructure. This demand and supply of the market is summarized in the book with highlights of the emerging strategies. Current, coherent, contextual, compatible, and comparative, Automated
Web Site Evaluation , manifests its strength by an extensive analysis  X  with a number of methods, along with a variety of automation types, and effort level  X  of the field.

For the sake of categorization of the evaluation process (of design, structure, content, etc.), Ivory relies on adapting the taxonomy developed by Sandrine Balbo (p. 16). The book is arranged has three parts. Part I has
Background (and Chapter 1 deals with Work Practices of Web Practitioners). Part II is on Researcher X  X  Per-spective (with Chapters 2 X 9, covering Automated Evaluation Methods, Usability Testing Methods, Inspection
Methods, Inquiry Methods, Analytical Modeling Methods, Simulation Methods, The WebTango Method, and Promising Research Directions). Part III dwells on Practitioner X  X  Perspective (Chapters 10 X 14, focused on Automated Evaluation Tools, Comparison of Guideline Review Tools, Empirical Study of Guideline Re-view Tools, Analysis of Web Design Guidelines, and Promising Tool Development Directions). In addition, an Appendix catalogs evaluation methodologies and tools.

While Automated Web Site Evaluation cites and documents useful tools, there is no way to know what is free among these tools, and what is for a fee. Furthermore, among the popular Web freebies, missing is any reference to Websitegarage (or any successors of this type), Netmechanic, Google page rank prediction &lt;www.rustybrick.com/pagerank-prediction.php&gt;, etc. There is no mention of other significant resources, such as, GlobalTester ( Load Testing Elements ), Jeff Nyman;  X  X  Load Testing for eConfidence  X  X  booklet distributed by

The title, Automated Web Site Evaluation implies that the book is all about automated process! Reading the book, however, will remove this illusion and show that automation, per se, does not offer a total solution.
Obviously, automated tool compliments the process. Because automation is still dependent on human input, human intervention and human inferences for a good return-on-investment in today X  X  volatile business envi-ronments  X  be it for satisfying the needs of researchers or practitioners. And the author is conscious about this interdependency (pp. 16, 123). For instance, under the caption, Role of Automated Evaluation Tools , Ivory states:
What I found interesting, although quite brief, is the book X  X  outlook in the area of information visualiza-tion (pp. 31, 44, 119). Incidentally, information visualization finds, its compatibility, in the Web X  X  distinct characteristic of multimedia-based semantic interoperability. And a useful reference book on Web site evalu-ation should have not just remained contented with textual stories (logs of the visible and perceptible content). There is a whole world of categories befitting the emerging visualization genre including streaming media, animated graphics, flash images, (server or client based) database driven visuals, sensory perceptible technol-ogies and interfaces (e.g., touch screen), etc., along with facets (type of medium, relay method, synchronizing tools, load time and speed, accessed via mobile or other modes, etc.), standards, etc. Automated Web Site Eval-uation can include this multifaceted dimension, with all its colors, in a future revision. Following, gives an idea of visualization and relevance to the evaluation process. The author says,
This book, nevertheless, based on so many detailed studies, is also focused on two pillars of Web infrastruc-ture: viz., accessibility and usability. Within this framework it serves as a source to understand best practices. Hopefully, businesses will apply Ivory X  X  findings and avoid another burst of the bubble. Also, Automated Web Site Evaluation systematically highlights input, throughput and output for creating, developing, maintaining and sustaining the web site. With these advantages, the book can be a handy tool for researchers, practitio-ners, and developers in the web domain. Inhibitive price for individuals apart, readers of the above-cited Automated Web Testing Toolkit , or a novice designer in this field will find, Automated Web Site Evaluation , far more beneficial.
 An Introduction to Search Engines and Web Navigation, Mark Levene, Addison Wesley Publisher (2006). 392 pp., ISBN: 0321306775, US$97.5
Effective searching and navigating on the World Wide Web (Web) have become important to various users in recent years, since the Web has already become the largest and most important information resource for an extremely diverse set of applications and users. We can also easily observe the ever-increasing utilization of the Web for the presentation and exchange of information in daily life and the ability of an individual or orga-nization to publish almost anything on the Web at very little cost. Without the technological advancements in search engines and navigation tools within Web browsers, using the huge Web resource would become almost impossible, since it is always growing in size and evolving in structure complexity.

This book attempts to introduce the readers to the subjects of Web searching and navigation and covers comprehensive issues in the rapidly growing field of Web technology. In its ten chapters, the book presents very readable materials on subjects from the background of search engines as early as the primitive hypertext prototype, the Bush X  X  Memex machine, dating back to 1945, to the state-of-the-art technologies for Web searching on mobile phones. In terms of its organization, the book is divided into three parts. The first part (Chapters 1 X 3) presents an account of existing search engines and highlights the underlying problems of Web interactions, such as the surprising low Web coverage by existing Web search engines. The second part (Chap-ters 4 X 6) discusses the Web search engines and includes an evaluation of search quality and the details of search mechanisms. The third part (Chapters 7 X 9) looks at the more advanced issues, such as mobile and
