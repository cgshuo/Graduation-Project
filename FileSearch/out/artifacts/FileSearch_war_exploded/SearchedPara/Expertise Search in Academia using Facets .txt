 H3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval. Algorithms, Design. Expert Search, Faceted Search, Terrier People search is an important problem, because users often require to identify relevant pe ople rather than documents. For instance, in an academic research setting, researchers may seek other researchers with complement ary skills for a given project. People search systems such as Spock [1] and ArnetMiner [2] allow retrieval of people with re levant expertise for a query. Faceted search is a common featur e in shopping websites, (as seen on Amazon and Ebay), where the results are grouped into a number of categories, typically including resu lt counters. This allows users to drill down to the particular aspects of the results that interest them most. In expert search, the presentation of the retrieved expert person is important, as users need to judge on whether to contact a given expert using the presented eviden ce. In this demo, we present a novel faceted search inte rface for a people sear ch engine, allowing results to be broken down by f acets such as university, and number of publications. It is of note that no other expert search engine provides a faceted inte rface for result exploration. AcademTech is a computing science-specific expert search engine based on the Terrier IR platfo rm [3]. Persons working at computing science departments in Scottish universities are considered as candidate experts by the system. Profiles of their expertise evidence are then mined from their homepages and publications retrieved from DBLP [5]. Using the expertise evidence, experts are ranked using the expCombMNZ voting techniques from the Voting Model [3]. Pre-determined facets , such as geographical location, university and publication count, are recorded during indexing. User queries return a ranked list of persons, into which the user can browse and explore by usi ng the facet options. The system demonstrates faceted search for academics by presenting refinement options using universit y, location and total publication range categories. The profile page for a person, linked from the result page, gives contact inform ation, publicati ons, as well as webpage and image search results provided by the Yahoo! BOSS API. Figure 1 presents a typical scenario where faceted search is useful with an expert search. Here a search for information retrieval experts can be refined to only s how experts located in Glasgow, with further refinement possible. Future work will investigate the selection of appropriate facets to display on a per-query basis. [1] Spock Website: http://www.spock.com/ [2] ArnetMiner Website: http://www.arnetminer.org/ [3] C.
