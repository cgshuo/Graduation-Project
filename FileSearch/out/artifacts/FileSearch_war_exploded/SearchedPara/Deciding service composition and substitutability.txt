For an open net N and a set X # P while to cover a transition t means that t is not dead. Such a strategy M is then called a Cover position may contain livelocks.
 3.1. Deciding coverability of open net nodes In this section, we show how a strategy M for N can be discovered as a Cover guideline of N . In order to define our notion of Cover X

With Strat Cover X  X  N  X  we denote the set of all Cover ined by an employee if the customer is not fixed in his credit control decision. Then M not (because transition t 5 cannot be enabled in M 1 N ).

 Corollary 1. The most permissive strategy MP for N is a strategy for N. For the proof of this corollary, we rely on a fact about operating guidelines as constructed in [5].
Proposition 2 [5]. For every operating guideline OG  X  X  Q ; C ; d ; q 1. uses only literals c where there is some q 0 2 Q with  X  q ; c ; q 0 2 d , and 2. is satisfied for the assignment assigning true to all literals in U  X  q  X  . marking of MP . By induction, it can be shown that, for all q 2 Q , m according to Definition 9 .So MP matches with OG N and thus MP is a strategy for N . h If inner M is in a marking m , then K  X  m  X  (the knowledge that inner while inner M is in marking m .
 Definition 14 ( Knowledge ). Let M be a strategy for an open net N . Let Mark markings of inner M and N , respectively. Let further m M inner M . The knowledge K : Mark M ! P  X  Mark N  X  that inner by K  X  m M  X  X f m N j X  m M m N  X  is reachable from  X  m 0 M
As an example, for the most permissive strategy MP N c for N

As the following proposition states,  X  m ; q 2 . implies that K  X  m  X  K  X  m most permissive strategy that corresponds to state q of an operating guideline.

MP ; OG The notion of knowledge can be applied to the operating guideline OG to a state q of OG N , the knowledge OG N has about N in q is equivalent to the knowledge inner Definition 15 ( Knowledge in OG). For an open net N let MP be the most permissive strategy for N and OG Let Mark N denote the set of markings of N and m q be a marking of inner about the possible markings of N in state q 2 Q is defined by K  X  q  X  X  K  X  m a Cover X -strategy for N .

 inner M and N , respectively. As t is a transition of N , t is enabled in m
Proposition 3 , there must be a state q in OG N where m N m 2 K  X  q  X  , and t is enabled in m N . From Proposition 3 follows m m M m N which can be extended by an occurrence of t since activation of t in m holds. h covered by a strategy for N if there is a state q in OG N enabled. That way, it is easily possible to annotate each state q of OG This can be done during the calculation of the operating guideline.
As an example, based on the knowledge values K  X  X  p q0  X   X  K  X  X  p nodes of N c that are covered in states q 0  X  q 4 of OG t 3.2. A finite representation of all Cover X -strategies guideline.

Consider again our running example N c in Fig. 1 a. Suppose we want to cover X  X f acc g in N  X  acc 2 K  X  q 4  X  ; K  X  q 6  X  ; K  X  q 9  X  , K  X  q 11  X  ; K  X  q at least a marking m acc of inner M that matches with q 4 we have  X  t 5 2 K  X  q 6  X  ; K  X  q 14  X  and  X  t 6 2 K  X  q 4 matches with q 6 or q 14 and it has a marking m t 6 of inner concept of an operating guideline.
 Consider again the example above. Since OG N c (see Fig. 2 ) represents all strategies and every Cover for every open net node x 2 X to be covered, at least one state q in OG tion between OG N c and a Cover X -strategy. This constraint can be expressed as a Boolean formula w between an open net and such an annotated automaton.
 Definition 16 ( Annotated automaton with global constraint). Let A Boolean formula with propositions taken from the set Q . Then, A w .

As an example for a global constraint to OG N c , consider w  X  X  q is assigned to sufficiently many states to cover the set X  X f t matches with A U , and in addition satisfies w .
 Definition 17 ( Matching withA U ; w ). Let M be an open net, and let A M : Q A !f true ; false g where c M  X  q  X  X  true iff there is a marking m of M such that  X  m ; q 2 . .
Finally, we are ready to construct the operating guideline with global constraint OG tation of the set Strat Cover X  X  N  X  of all Cover X -strategies for N . Definition 18 ( Global constraint for covering X). Let N be an open net and OG is enabled. Then w X  X  V x : x 2 X W q : x q q . OG w X  X  N  X  X  X  OG
As a direct consequence of Theorem 1 , we obtain the main result of this section; that is, OG strategies for N .

Theorem 2. M is a Cover X -strategy for N iff M matches with OG
Proof. ( ) ) Let M be a Cover X -strategy for N and let OG M matches with OG w X  X  N  X  .
 Since M is a Cover X -strategy for N , M is a strategy for N and thus matches with OG q 2 Q of OG N , a marking m M in inner M , and a marking m
Definition 17 , M matches with OG w X  X  N  X  . (  X  ) Let M match with OG w X  X  N  X  . We show M is a Cover Since M matches with OG w X  X  N  X  we know by Definition 17 that M matches with OG

 By construction, the obtained service automaton MP 0 P is a Cover MP P and no state becomes unreachable.

 The apparent candidate for the desired automaton S would be MP essence, the problem with MP P is that there may be several q constructing S differently. The idea is to use the simulation relation . tiple ( lcm ). This name is inspired by the observation that, if P is a simple loop of length m and P S would have exactly lcm  X  m ; n  X  states.

Let, the other way round, q P ! a q 0 P and  X  q with q P 0 ! a q 0 P 0 which is uniquely determined since P  X  q 0 since P is deterministic, so there is no other choice to match a in P . Analogously, presence of  X  q 0 Next, we show that there is a simulation of arbitrary Cover Lemma 4. Let A 2 Strat Cover X  X  P  X  . Then there is a simulation of A by lcm  X  OG Proof. As A 2 Strat Cover X  X  P  X  , there is a simulation of A by OG lcm  X  OG P ; OG P 0  X  . Since simulation is transitive, there is a simulation of A by lcm  X  OG Now we can show the main claim of this section. Assume there is an arbitrary Cover Cover Y -strategy for P 0 . Using the simulation of A by lcm  X  OG

 Lemma 5. If A is a Cover X -strategy for P, so is Im  X  A  X  .
 Proof. We have to show (1) OG P simulates Im  X  A  X  , (2) Im  X  A  X  satisfies the local annotations of OG global constraint w X .
 Ad (1). Im  X  A  X  is (by Definition 22 ) a subautomaton of lcm  X  OG Q Ad (2). We proceed by showing first that  X  q A ;  X  q P ; q the initial states. Let  X  q A ;  X  q P ; q P 0 2 .

By construction of lcm  X  OG Now we can show that Im  X  A  X  satisfies the local annotations of OG there is a state q A of A where  X  q A ;  X  q P ; q P 0 2 .

The  X  X  X inal X  proposition is true in  X  q  X  q ; q P 0 . We distinguish two cases. If there is a send event leaving  X  q true. In the other case, the assignment used for checking U the assignment used in q A is true. Since U OG P  X  q P  X  is monotonous, U
Im  X  A  X  . Since A is a Cover X -strategy for P , w X evaluates to true. h
Now we prove that Im  X  A  X  is not a Cover Y -strategy for P that local annotations accord to each other. Thus, A must satisfy local annotations of OG show that, if A violates the global constraint w Y of OG P 0 ficient for establishing this claim. It proves that A touches at least as many states in OG does A .
