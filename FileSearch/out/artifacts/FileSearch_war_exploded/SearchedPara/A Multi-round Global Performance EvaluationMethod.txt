 In interactive image retrieval systems, when users search images in an image collection, they first input some queries, which can be keywords or images, to get some initial image search results. In contrast to web page search, in image retrieval, it may be not easy for users to reach the targets in the direct search results of the queries. Some reasons can lead to their failures on reaching the targets in these initial search results. For example, users do not exactly describe their specific targets in the queries because it is a difficult or boring task; the targets of users may be still not clear when they start their searches, because they are just seeking the information they are interested in; the performance of image retrieval methods are still not good enough to return results matching the query topics or detect user intentions for personalized search results. Therefore, many image retrieval systems provide interfaces of user interactions, e.g., relevance feedback, to gather additional information for refining the search results. recent systems have succinct and convenient interfaces. They allow users to click images to view other similar or related images until they reach the targets. Figure 1 shows an example with Google image search 1  X  X yoto X  as the search keyword, Google returns the initial image search results. There is a link of  X  X earch by image X  for each image in the search results. The user can click these links to reach further results until he finds satisfied results. After several rounds of clicks and views, this user finally finds his target image which is about the cherry-blossom at Arashiyama in Kyoto in spring. Existing evaluation approaches of image retrieval methods in the scenario of interactive image retrieval provide local evaluation by selecting some sam-ples and using single-round evaluation with initial search results and first-round user interaction on the initial search results. On one hand, they does not eval-uate the performance of results after multi-round interactions. On the other hand, whether the selected samples can represent the whole information space of the data collection which may have tens of thousands of or millions of images, and whether this local performance is equivalent to the global performance are unknown. Therefore, to evaluate the performance of image retrieval methods in the interactive scenario, besides single-round local evaluation approach, we also need to propose a multi-round global evaluation approach by considering the images in the whole data collection and multi-round interactions in a search session.
 We find that the image search behavior with user interactions in a search session can be regarded as navigation on the information space of the image collection. A query image or the first clicked image in the search results of a query keyword is the start of this navigation. The end of this navigation is some images which may contain the final target images. The user may find the targets or fail to find the targets in current search session and give up at the end of this navigation. In a search session, there is a route from the start image to the target image. The user navigates the images in the image information network through this route. Figure 2 shows an example of the navigation perspective of interactive image retrieval. In this search session, there is a route from the start image to the target image. Full lines mark the route, and dotted lines show other images that are not clicked in the search results. A user navigates the images in the image information network through this route.
 network for an image collection based on a specific image retrieval method. The nodes in the network are images, and the edges in the network depend on the image retrieval method which generates top k search results of an image from the image collection. We utilize the properties of this information network to propose our multi-round global evaluation metrics. This information network can also be utilized for various applications such as image re-ranking, user inten-tion detection and personalized target prediction in image retrieval. In this paper we concentrate on using it for the evaluation on the performance of an image retrieval method on an image collection. The length of shortest path of two images on information network can show the difficulty of reaching the target image from the start image in ideal.
  X  We propose an approach for evaluating multi-round global performance of  X  We provide a novel model with navigation perspective for interactive image in Section 2. In section 3, we introduce how to construct the image information network and propose our evaluation method. We report the experimental results in Section 4 and give a conclusion in Section 5. On the hand, Ref. [ 1 ] lists many works on image retrieval. Many of them focus on the issue of one query and its direct image search results without further interactions. In their evaluation, they select a subset with some labeled samples. On the other hand, Relevance feedback has been widely used in image re-ranking in supervised scenarios and is an important solution in interactive image retrieval. Rui et al. [ 3 ] and Porkaew et al. [ 4 ] proposed query reweighting, query reformulation, query modification, query point movement and query expansion approaches. Ref. [ 5 ] only requires the user to click one image in the interaction to minimize the effort of selecting relevance feedback instances. Our model of interactive image retrieval assumes a succinct and convenient user interaction interface in which users click an image in the results to search by this image. The evaluation approaches used in interactive image retrieval, e.g., Ref. [ 3  X  5 ], mainly consider only one round user interaction; they select a small number of samples and take local evaluation in the data collection.
 In contrast to the single-round local evaluation used in related work, our pro-posed evaluation approach based on the image information network can provide an ideal multi-round global evaluation. In this section, we first describe our model of interactive image retrieval and then introduce the approach of how to construct the information network for a given image collection based on a specific image retrieval method. After that we propose our evaluation approach based on this information network. 3.1 Interactive Image Retrieval Our model of interactive image retrieval is as follows. We define the images as a in a given image collection C . In a search session, the queries that user input can be images or keywords. In the case of query by image, the start image is the query; in the case of query by keyword, the start image is the clicked image in the initial search results. This definition of start image can simplify the constructed information network with only one type of nodes to facilitate the analysis on the graph for various applications. Each node in this graph represents an image. There is no node representing other types of objects such as text.
 It may be boring for users to input too many additional actions in user inter-actions, and users may prefer succinct and convenient interfaces. Therefore, in our scenario of interactive image retrieval, in each round of user interaction, we simplify that a user selects and clicks only one image. Such one-click inter-face is used in recent image search engine like Google image search. After the user clicks, a specific image retrieval method F is used to return top search results by using this clicked image as query. This image retrieval method can use either visual content information or textual context information of the clicked image. There are several rounds of user interactions in a search session. The images clicked in all rounds construct a navigation sequence on the graph which is a path from the start image to the end images. Note that end images can be target images or not. It depends on whether the search sessions success or fail.
 the areas like web page search. We assume that when a user modifies his original query, the current search session is regarded as finished, no matter whether the user reaches his targets. There are no jumps from one image node to another image node between which there is no edge, because such jump is regarded as a new session. In this way, the navigation behavior on the image information network in a search session is continuous by following the edges on the graph. All the simplifications in this model can smooth the analysis on the graph when using it for applications. 3.2 Information Network Construction The steps of image information network construction for an image collection based on the search results of an image retrieval method F automatic process doesn X  X  require users X  participation.  X  1. Create a node for each image a i in the image collection  X  2. For each image a i , compute its top k image search results  X  3. Create an edge from a i to each image a j in A i . This image information images in the search engine results page (SERP). Therefore, the out-degrees in this constructed information network is at most k . This constrain is able to control the edges of the graph and the time cost when computing the graph properties for analysis.
 be stored as the weights of the edges. Because it is not yet necessary in this paper, we still use same weights (equal to 1) for all edges. 3.3 Performance Evaluation Method The image information network can be used in various applications. In this section, we specially discuss the issue about how to evaluate the performance of an image retrieval method on an image collection using this information net-work. In the communities of graph theory and social network analysis, many metrics have been proposed for analyzing various properties of graph, e.g., aver-age shortest path, diameter, centrality, and so on. We select two metrics which can reflect the difficulty of navigation from one start image to another target image. One is the length of average shortest path of two images on the information network which shows the average navigation difficulty in ideal; the other is the diameter of the graph which shows the upper limit of steps in a navigation in ideal.
 Because we use top k search results to construct the information network and thus the out-degrees in this network are at most k , the cut-off size parameter becomes an important factor that influences the network properties. Therefore, the evaluation metrics we propose include this parameter k Shortest Path at top k results ( ASP@k ) and Diameter at top The evaluation approach we propose reflect the multi-round global perfor-mance of an image retrieval method by using all rounds of user interactions in a search session and considering the images in the whole data collection. Our evaluation approach is an evaluation approach in the ideal case on the image collection for the following several reasons.  X  First, users may not select the ideal shortest path to reach the targets.
West et al. [ 6 ] made an analysis of human wayfinding in entity information network. They find that human wayfinding is different from shortest paths but is still very efficient. How to assist users to select the paths close to ideal ones is one of our future work.  X  Second, not all start and target image pairs included in the evaluation metrics are meaningful enough. Although we assume that users intention in a query session can change and the start and target images can be not similar or related to each other, there are still start and target pairs that rarely appear in the real world search.  X  Third, these evaluation metrics assume that users do not give up the search sessions, do unlimited rounds and do not click the back button until they reach the targets.
 Because it is an ideal evaluation, this evaluation approach is not proposed to instead the exiting evaluation methods. It provides the evaluation on another aspect of the performance and is a useful supplement to existing single-round local evaluation approaches.
 Because the graph construction and property analysis are time consuming for huge collections, in practice, we can only use a subset of the collection to speed up the construction. Such subset can contain tens of thousands of images and is still much larger than a selected samples used in exiting evaluation approaches. 4.1 Experimental Settings The dataset we use for our experiments is MIRFlickr 25000 [ 2 ] which is con-structed by images and tags downloaded from Flickr. It contains 25,000 images and provides the raw tags of these images on Flickr. We use two kinds of visual features as two different content based image retrieval methods respectively. One is color feature. The feature descriptor is a 1024-Dimension color histogram on the HSV color space. The other one is the SIFT feature with the bags of words model and 1000 visual words in the codebook.
 by computing the distance of visual feature vectors. The distance between image a and a j is computed using a Pearson correlation distance s where H i and H j are feature vectors. N is the size of the feature vector. related images to the query image. The textual information in the dataset is social tag. We use the tag list of an image as its textual feature vector, and gen-erate the top k relevant images of an image by computing the Ochiai coefficient of textual feature vectors. The distance between image a i where T i and T j are textual feature vectors, and | X | is the number of tags. The images without textual information have no related images. 4.2 Experimental Results After we construct the information networks with this dataset and the three image retrieval methods, we evaluate the performance of these methods on the metrics of ASP@k and Dia@k. Table 1 lists the experimental results. based on different purposes, i.e, visual similar images and textual related images. We use two content based methods to show how to make comparison with our evaluation metrics. In these two content based methods based on different visual features, for a given parameter k , the method using SIFT feature always has smaller average shortest path and diameter (except the diameter on the method using HSV feature. We therefore claim that this SIFT feature based image retrieval method has better global performance than the HSV feature based image retrieval method for this data collection. The reason may be that in this image collection, more images are better to be represented by SIFT feature when searching for visual similar images.
 In addition, Table 1 also shows that as the k increases, both length of average shortest path and diameter decrease. It is as expected because when more edges are added in the graph, it is easier to move from one node to another node. ASP @ k can also be used as reference for evaluating the proper value of image retrieval method, which means the number of images returned in the top search results, e.g., the maximum k with ASP @ k  X  6. It means that in average any two images  X  X now X  each other within six degrees. Although there is no proof that the six degrees of separation theory [ 8 ] is proper here, it can be a candidate criteria for tuning parameter k . In this paper, we model the image search behavior with user interactions as navigation on a information network of image collection. We propose a global evaluation approach on the performance of multi-round user interactions on the whole image collection by using the properties of this image information network. For the future work, we will make further verification to this evaluation approach.
