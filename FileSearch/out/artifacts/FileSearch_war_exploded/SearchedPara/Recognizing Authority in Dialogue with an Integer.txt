 In this work, we seek to formalize the ways speak-ers position themselves in discourse. We do this in a way that maintains a notion of discourse structure, and which can be aggregated to evaluate a speaker X  X  overall stance in a dialogue. We define the body of work in positioning to include any attempt to formal-ize the processes by which speakers attempt to influ-ence or give evidence of their relations to each other. Constructs such as Initiative and Control (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988), which attempt to operationalize the authority over a discourse X  X  structure, fall under the umbrella of positioning. As we construe posi-tioning, it also includes work on detecting certainty and confusion in speech (Liscombe et al., 2005), which models a speaker X  X  understanding of the in-formation in their statements. Work in dialogue act tagging is also relevant, as it seeks to describe the ac-tions and moves with which speakers display these types of positioning (Stolcke et al., 2000).
To complement these bodies of work, we choose to focus on the question of how speakers position themselves as authoritative in a discourse. This means that we must describe the way speakers intro-duce new topics or discussions into the discourse; the way they position themselves relative to that topic; and how these functions interact with each other. While all of the tasks mentioned above focus on specific problems in the larger rhetorical question of speaker positioning, none explicitly address this framing of authority. Each does have valuable ties to the work that we would like to do, and in section 2, we describe prior work in each of those areas, and elaborate on how each relates to our questions.
We measure this as an authoritativeness ratio . Of the contentful dialogue moves made by a speaker, in what fraction of those moves is the speaker po-sitioned as the primary authority on that topic? To measure this quantitatively, we introduce the Nego-tiation framework, a construct from the field of sys-temic functional linguistics (SFL), which addresses specifically the concepts that we are interested in. We present a reproducible formulation of this so-ciolinguistics research in section 3, along with our preliminary findings on reliability between human coders, where we observe inter-rater agreement of 0.71. Applying this coding scheme to data, we see strong correlations with important motivational con-structs such as Self-Efficacy (Bandura, 1997) as well as learning gains.

Next, we address automatic coding of the Ne-gotiation framework, which we treat as a two-dimensional classification task. One dimension is a set of codes describing the authoritative status of a contribution 1 . The other dimension is a segmen-tation task. We impose constraints on both of these models based on the structure observed in the work of SFL. These constraints are formulated as boolean statements describing what a correct label sequence looks like, and are imposed on our model using an Integer Linear Programming formulation (Roth and Yih, 2004). In section 5, this model is evaluated on a subset of the MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) and shows a high correlation with human judgements of authoritativeness ( r 2 = 0.947). After a detailed error analysis, we will conclude the paper in section 6 with a discussion of our future work. The Negotiation framework, as formulated by the SFL community, places a special emphasis on how speakers function in a discourse as sources or recip-ients of information or action. We break down this concept into a set of codes, one code per contribu-tion. Before we break down the coding scheme more concretely in section 3, it is important to understand why we have chosen to introduce a new framework, rather than reusing existing computational work.
Much work has examined the emergence of dis-course structure from the choices speakers make at the linguistic and intentional level (Grosz and Sid-ner, 1986). For instance, when a speaker asks a question, it is expected to be followed with an an-swer. In discourse analysis, this notion is described through dialogue games (Carlson, 1983), while con-versation analysis frames the structure in terms of adjacency pairs (Schegloff, 2007). These expec-tations can be viewed under the umbrella of con-ditional relevance (Levinson, 2000), and the ex-changes can be labelled discourse segments .
In prior work, the way that people influence dis-course structure is described through the two tightly-related concepts of initiative and control . A speaker who begins a discourse segment is said to have ini-tiative, while control accounts for which speaker is being addressed in a dialogue (Whittaker and Sten-ton, 1988). As initiative passes back and forth be-tween discourse participants, control over the con-versation similarly transfers from one speaker to an-other (Walker and Whittaker, 1990). This relation is often considered synchronous, though evidence sug-gests that the reality is not straightforward (Jordan and Di Eugenio, 1997).

Research in initiative and control has been ap-plied in the form of mixed-initiative dialogue sys-tems (Smith, 1992). This is a large and ac-tive field, with applications in tutorial dialogues (Core, 2003), human-robot interactions (Peltason and Wrede, 2010), and more general approaches to effective turn-taking (Selfridge and Heeman, 2010). However, that body of work focuses on influenc-ing discourse structure through positioning. The question that we are asking instead focuses on how speakers view their authority as a source of informa-tion about the topic of the discourse.
 In particular, consider questioning in discourse. In mixed-initiative analysis of discourse, asking a question always gives you control of a discourse. There is an expectation that your question will be followed by an answer. A speaker might already know the answer to a question they asked -for instance, when a teacher is verifying a student X  X  knowledge. However, in most cases asking a ques-tion represents a lack of authority, treating the other speakers as a source for that knowledge. While there have been preliminary attempts to separate out these specific types of positioning in initiative, such as Chu-Carroll and Brown (1998), it has not been stud-ied extensively in a computational setting.

Another similar thread of research is to identify a speaker X  X  certainty , that is, the confidence of a speaker and how that self-evaluation affects their language (Pon-Barry and Shieber, 2010). Substan-tial work has gone into automatically identifying levels of speaker certainty, for example in Liscombe et al. (2005) and Litman et al. (2009). The major difference between our work and this body of liter-ature is that work on certainty has rarely focused on how state translates into interaction between speak-ers (with some exceptions, such as the application of certainty to tutoring dialogues (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2009)). Instead, the focus is on the person X  X  self-evaluation, independent of the influence on the speaker X  X  positioning within a discourse.

Dialogue act tagging seeks to describe the moves people make to express themselves in a discourse. This task involves defining the role of each contri-bution based on its function (Stolcke et al., 2000). We know that there are interesting correlations be-tween these acts and other factors, such as learning gains (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2006) and the rel-evance of a contribution for summarization (Wrede and Shriberg, 2003). However, adapting dialogue act tags to the question of how speakers position themselves is not straightforward. In particular, the granularity of these tagsets, which is already a highly debated topic (Popescu-Belis, 2008), is not ideal for the task we have set for ourselves. Many dialogue acts can be used in authoritative or non-authoritative ways, based on context, and can posi-tion a speaker as either giver or receiver of informa-tion. Thus these more general tagsets are not specific enough to the role of authority in discourse.
Each of these fields of prior work is highly valu-able. However, none were designed to specifically describe how people present themselves as a source or recipient of knowledge in a discourse. Thus, we have chosen to draw on a different field of soci-olinguistics. Our formalization of that theory is de-scribed in the next section. We now present the Negotiation framework 2 , which we use to answer the questions left unanswered in the previous section. Within the field of SFL, this framework has been continually refined over the last three decades (Berry, 1981; Martin, 1992; Martin, 2003). It attempts to describe how speakers use their role as a source of knowledge or action to position themselves relative to others in a discourse.
Applications of the framework include distin-guishing between focus on teacher knowledge and student reasoning (Veel, 1999) and distribution of authority in juvenile trials (Martin et al., 2008). The framework can also be applied to problems similar to those studied through the lens of initiative, such as the distinction between authority over discourse structure and authority over content (Martin, 2000).
A challenge of applying this work to language technologies is that it has historically been highly qualitative, with little emphasis placed on repro-ducibility. We have formulated a pared-down, repro-ducible version of the framework, presented in Sec-tion 3.1. Evidence of the usefulness of that formu-lation for identifying authority, and of correlations that we can study based on these codes, is presented briefly in Section 3.2. 3.1 Our Formulation of Negotiation The codes that we can apply to a contribution us-ing the Negotiation framework are comprised of four main codes, K1, K2, A1, and A2, and two additional codes, ch and o. This is a reduction over the many task-specific or highly contextual codes used in the original work. This was done to ensure that a ma-chine learning classification task would not be over-whelmed with many infrequent classes.
 The main codes are divided by two questions. First, is the contribution related to exchanging infor-mation, or to exchanging services and actions? If the former, then it is a K move (knowledge); if the latter, then an A move (action). Second, is the contribution acting as a primary actor, or secondary? In the case of knowledge, this often correlates to the difference between assertions (K1) and queries (K2). For in-stance, a statement of fact or opinion is a K1:
By contrast, asking for someone else X  X  knowledge or opinion is a K2:
In the case of action, the codes usually corre-spond to narrating action (A1) and giving instruc-tions (A2), as below:
A challenge move (ch) is one which directly con-tradicts the content or assertion of the previous line, or makes that previous contribution irrelevant. For instance, consider the exchange below, where an in-struction is rejected because its presuppositions are broken by the challenging statement.
All moves that do not fit into one of these cate-gories are classified as other (o). This includes back-channel moves, floor-grabbing moves, false starts, and any other non-contentful contributions.

This theory makes use of discourse segmenta-tion. Research in the SFL community has focused on intra-segment structure, and empirical evidence from this research has shown that exchanges be-tween speakers follow a very specific pattern:
That is to say, each segment contains a primary move (a K1 or an A1) and an optional preceding secondary move, with other non-contentful moves interspersed throughout. A single statement of fact would be a K1 move comprising an entire segment, while a single question/answer pair would be a K2 move followed by a K1. Longer exchanges of many lines obviously also occur.

We iteratively developed a coding manual which describes, in a reproducible way, how to apply the codes listed above. The six codes we use, along with their frequency in our corpus, are given in Table 1. In the next section, we evaluate the reliability and utility of hand-coded data, before moving on to au-tomation in section 4. 3.2 Preliminary Evaluation This coding scheme was evaluated for reliability on two corpora using Cohen X  X  kappa (Cohen, 1960). Within the social sciences community, a kappa above 0.7 is considered acceptable. Two conversa-tions were each coded by hand by two trained anno-tators. The first conversation was between three stu-dents in a collaborative learning task; inter-rater re-liability kappa for Negotiation labels was 0.78. The second conversation was from the MapTask corpus, and kappa was 0.71. Further data was labelled by hand by one trained annotator.

In our work, we label conversations using the cod-ing scheme above. To determine how well these codes correlate with other interesting factors, we choose to assign a quantitative measure of authori-tativeness to each speaker. This measure can then be compared to other features of a speaker. To do this, we use the coded labels to assign an Authori-tativeness Ratio to each speaker. First, we define a Code Meaning Count Percent function A ( S,c,L ) for a speaker, a contribution, and a set of labels L  X  X  K 1 ,K 2 ,A 1 ,A 2 ,o,ch } as: A ( S,c,L ) = We then define the Authoritativeness ratio Auth ( S ) for a speaker S in a dialogue consisting of contributions c 1 ...c n as:
The intuition behind this ratio is that we are only interested in the four main label types in our analy-sis -at least for an initial description of authority, we do not consider the non-contentful o moves. Within these four main labels, there are clearly two that ap-pear  X  X ominant X  -statements of fact or opinion, and commands or instructions -and two that appear less dominant -questions or requests for information, and narration of an action. We sum these together to reach a single numeric value for each speaker X  X  projection of authority in the dialogue.

The full details of our external validations of this approach are available in Howley et al. (2011). To summarize, we considered two data sets involving student collaborative learning. The first data set con-sisted of pairs of students interacting over two days, and was annotated for aggressive behavior, to assess warning factors in social interactions. Our analysis showed that aggressive behavior correlated with au-thoritativeness ratio ( p &lt; . 05 ), and that less aggres-sive students became less authoritative in the second day ( p &lt; . 05 , effect size . 15  X  ). The second data set was analyzed for Self-Efficacy -the confidence of each student in their own ability (Bandura, 1997) -as well as actual learning gains based on pre-and post-test scores. We found that the Authoritativeness ratio was a significant predictor of learning gains ( r 2 = . 41 , p &lt; . 04 ). Furthermore, in a multiple re-gression, we determined that the Authoritativeness ratio of both students in a group predict the average Self-Efficacy of the pair ( r 2 = . 12 , p &lt; . 01 ). We know that our coding scheme is useful for mak-ing predictions about speakers. We now judge whether it can be reproduced fully automatically. Our model must select, for each contribution c i in a dialogue, the most likely classification label l i from { K 1 ,K 2 ,A 1 ,A 2 ,o,ch } . We also build in paral-lel a segmentation model to select s i from the set { new,same } . Our baseline approach to both prob-lems is to use a bag-of-words model of the contribu-tion, and use machine learning for classification.
Certain types of interactions, explored in section 4.1, are difficult or impossible to classify without context. We build a contextual feature space, de-scribed in section 4.2, to enhance our baseline bag-of-words model. We can also describe patterns that appear in discourse segments, as detailed in section 3.1. In our coding manual, these instructions are given as rules for how segments should be coded by humans. Our hypothesis is that by enforcing these rules in the output of our automatic classifier, per-formance will increase. In section 4.3 we formalize these constraints using Integer Linear Programming. 4.1 Challenging cases We want to distinguish between phenomena such as in the following two examples.
In this case, a one-token contribution is indis-putably a K1 move, answering a yes/no question. However, in the dialogue below, it is equally inar-guable that the same move is an A1:
Without this context, these moves would be indis-tinguishable to a model. With it, they are both easily classified correctly.

We also observed that markers for segmentation of a segment vary between contentful initiations and non-contentful ones. For instance, filler noises can often initiate segments:
Situations such as this are common. This is also a challenge for segmentation, as demonstrated below:
A long statement or instruction from one speaker is followed up with a terse response (in the same segment) from the listener. However, after that back-channel move, a short floor-grabbing move is often made to start the next segment. This is a distinc-tion that a bag-of-words model would have difficulty with. This is markedly different from contentful seg-ment initiations:
All three of these lines look like statements, which often initiate new segments. However, only the first should be marked as starting a new segment. The other two are topically related, in the second line by contradicting the instruction, and in the third by re-peating the previous person X  X  statement. 4.2 Contextual Feature Space Additions To incorporate the insights above into our model, we append features to our bag-of-words model. First, in our classification model we include both lexical bigrams and part-of-speech bigrams to encode fur-ther lexical knowledge and some notion of syntac-tic structure. To account for restatements and topic shifts, we add a feature based on cosine similarity (using term vectors weighted by TF-IDF calculated over training data). We then add a feature for the predicted label of the previous contribution -after each contribution is classified, the next contribution adds a feature for the automatic label. This requires our model to function as an on-line classifier.
We build two segmentation models, one trained on contributions of less than four tokens, and an-other trained on contributions of four or more to-kens, to distinguish between characteristics of con-tentful and non-contentful contributions. To the short-contribution model, we add two additional fea-tures. The first represents the ratio between the length of the current contribution and the length of the previous contribution. The second represents whether a change in speaker has occurred between the current and previous contribution. 4.3 Constraints using Integer Linear We formulate our constraints using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). This formulation has an ad-vantage over other sequence labelling formulations, such as Viterbi decoding, in its ability to enforce structure through constraints. We then enhance this classifier by adding constraints, which allow expert knowledge of discourse structure to be enforced in classification. We can use these constraints to elim-inate label options which would violate the rules for a segment outlined in our coding manual.

Each classification decision is made at the contri-bution level, jointly optimizing the Negotiation la-bel and segmentation label for a single contribution, then treating those labels as given for the next con-tribution classification.

To define our objective function for optimization, for each possible label, we train a one vs. all SVM, and use the resulting regression for each label as a score, giving us six values ~ l i for our Negotiation label and two values ~s i for our segmentation label. Then, subject to the constraints below, we optimize: Thus, at each contribution, if the highest-scoring Negotiation label breaks a constraint, the model can optimize whether to drop to the next-most-likely la-bel, or start a new segment.

Recall from section 3.1 that our discourse seg-ments follow strict rules related to ordering and rep-etition of contributions. Below, we list the con-straints that we used in our model to enforce that pattern, along with a brief explanation of the intu-ition behind each.
The first constraints enforce the rule that a pri-mary move cannot occur before a secondary move in the same segment. For instance, a question must initiate a new segment if it follows a statement.
These constraints specify that A moves and K moves cannot cooccur in a segment. An instruc-tion for action and a question requesting information must be considered separate segments.
This pair states that two primary moves cannot oc-cur in the same segment unless they are contiguous, in rapid succession.
The last set of constraints enforce the intuitive notion that a speaker cannot follow their own sec-ondary move with a primary move in that segment (such as answering their own question).
Computationally, an advantage of these con-straints is that they do not extend past the current segment in history. This means that they usually are only enforced over the past few moves, and do not enforce any global constraint over the structure of the whole dialogue. This allows the constraints to be flexible to various conversational styles, and tractable for fast computation independent of the length of the dialogue. We test our models on a twenty conversation sub-set of the MapTask corpus detailed in Table 1. We compare the use of four models in our results.  X  Baseline: This model uses a bag-of-words fea- X  Baseline+ILP: This model uses the baseline  X  Contextual: This model uses our enhanced  X  Contextual+ILP: This model uses the en-
For segmentation, we evaluate our models using exact-match accuracy. We use multiple evaluation metrics to judge classification. The first and most basic is accuracy -the percentage of accurately cho-sen Negotiation labels. Secondly, we use Cohen X  X  Kappa (Cohen, 1960) to judge improvement in ac-curacy over chance. The final evaluation is the r 2 coefficient computed between predicted and actual Authoritativeness ratios per speaker. This represents how much variance in authoritativeness is accounted for in the predicted ratios. This final metric is the most important for measuring reproducibility of hu-man analyses of speaker authority in conversation.
We use SIDE for feature extraction (Mayfield and Ros  X  e, 2010), SVM-Light for machine learning Model Accuracy Kappa r 2 Baseline 59.7% 0.465 0.354 Baseline+ILP 61.6% 0.488 0.663 Segmentation 72.3% Contextual 66.7% 0.565 0.908 Contextual+ILP 68.4% 0.584 0.947 Segmentation 74.9% (Joachims, 1999), and Learning-Based Java for ILP inference (Rizzolo and Roth, 2010). Performance is evaluated by 20-fold cross-validation, where each fold is trained on 19 conversations and tested on the remaining one. Statistical significance was calcu-lated using a student X  X  paired t -test. For accuracy and kappa, n = 20 (one data point per conversation) and for r 2 , n = 40 (one data point per speaker). 5.1 Results All classification results are given in Table 2 and charts showing correlation between predicted and actual speaker Authoritativeness ratios are shown in Figure 1. We observe that the baseline bag-of-words model performs well above random chance (kappa of 0.465); however, its accuracy is still very low and its ability to predict Authoritativeness ratio of a speaker is not particularly high ( r 2 of 0.354 with ratios from manually labelled data). We observe a significant improvement when ILP constraints are applied to this model.

The contextual model described in section 4.2 performs better than our baseline constrained model. However, the gains found in the contextual model are somewhat orthogonal to the gains from using ILP constraints, as applying those constraints to the contextual model results in further performance gains (and a high r 2 coefficient of 0.947).
Our segmentation model was evaluated based on exact matches in boundaries. Switching from base-line to contextual features, we observe an improve-ment in accuracy of 2.6%. 5.2 Error Analysis An error analysis of model predictions explains the large effect on correlation despite relatively smaller changes in accuracy. Our Authoritativeness ratio does not take into account moves labelled o or ch . What we find is that the most advanced model still makes many mistakes at determining whether a move should be labelled as o or a core move. This er-ror rate is, however, fairly consistent across the four core move codes. When a move is determined (cor-rectly) to not be an o move, the system is highly ac-curate in distinguishing between the four core labels.
The one systematic confusion that continues to appear most frequently in our results is the inabil-ity to distinguish between a segment containing an A 2 move followed by an A 1 move, and a segment containing a K 1 move followed by an o move. The surface structure of these types of exchanges is very similar. Consider the following two exchanges:
These two exchanges on a surface level are highly similar. Out of context, making this distinction is very hard even for human coders, so it is not surpris-ing then that this pattern is the most difficult one to recognize in this corpus. It contributes most of the remaining confusion between the four core codes. In this work we have presented one formulation of authority in dialogue. This formulation allows us to describe positioning in discourse in a way that is complementary to prior work in mixed-initiative dialogue systems and analysis of speaker certainty. Our model includes a simple understanding of dis-course structure while also encoding information about the types of moves used, and the certainty of a speaker as a source of information. This formulation is reproducible by human coders, with an inter-rater reliability of 0.71.

We have then presented a computational model for automatically applying these codes per contribu-tion. In our best model, we see a good 68.4% accu-racy on a six-way individual contribution labelling task. More importantly, this model replicates human analyses of authoritativeness very well, with an r 2 coefficient of 0.947.

There is room for improvement in our model in future work. Further use of contextual features will more thoroughly represent the information we want our model to take into account. Our segmentation accuracy is also fairly low, and further examination of segmentation accuracy using a more sophisticated evaluation metric, such as WindowDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002), would be helpful.

In general, however, we now have an automated model that is reliable in reproducing human judg-ments of authoritativeness. We are now interested in how we can apply this to the larger questions of po-sitioning we began this paper by asking, especially in describing speaker positioning at various instants throughout a single discourse. This will be the main thrust of our future work.
