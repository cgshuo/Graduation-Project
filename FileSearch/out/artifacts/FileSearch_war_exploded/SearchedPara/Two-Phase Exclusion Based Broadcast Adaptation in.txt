 provide better performance. In this paper, we mainly deal with the problem of how to update the broadcast content. of broadcasted data, and then removes data with popularity lower than the predefined remedy this deficiency, a solution called  X  X emperature probing X  was proposed by [6]. from Ministry of Education, China (Grant no. 20020335020).
 performance. How to identify the popularity of data being broadcasted and reduce the improper exclusions effectively is then the focus of this paper. 
In this paper, we propose a two-phase exclusion model, which initially divides data are popular. The primary rationale is that some data are always requested together in most cases. cepts and the proposed algorithm. The experimental study and results are presented in Section 3. Section 4 concludes the paper. 2.1 Related Definition implication of the form FD  X  SD , FD and SD are two data sets satisfying FD  X  SD = 2.2 Update of Broadcast Data In our paper, we adopt the prediction-based solution such as [6]. Each data for broad-tance marks are lower than a certain baseline. 2.3 Two-Phase Exclusion Scheme correlations based broadcast scheme. In our paper, we further study the inner correla-tions of deleted data and propose a two-phase exclusion scheme. the corresponding relevancy identification earlier. 
Data_Division( ed , firstpart , secondpart , ar ){ sort ar in an ascending order by the number of the consequent data of each rule. If two rules have same length, rule that has shorter antecedent has the priority; for each r in ar { if( non-overlap ( anteced ( r ), secondpart )){ add data of anteced ( r ) to firstpart ; for each data d of conseq ( r ) if(! belong ( d , firstpart )) add d to secondpart ; } else if( belong ( anteced ( r , secondpart ) &amp;&amp; | anteced ( r )| &lt; | conseq ( r )| &amp;&amp; ! belong ( conseq ( r ), firstpart ))){ remove data of anteced ( r ) from secondpart ; add anteced ( r ) to firstpart ; add conseq ( r ) to secondpart ; } } for each data d of ed if(! belong ( d , firstpart ) &amp;&amp; ! belong ( d , secondpart )) add d to firstpart ; } 
Based on the data divided above, the two-phase exclusion is implemented to real-are re-called back to broadcast successively. In the second phase, based on the asso-data in wpd are identified.

For each database, transaction number varies from 10k to 1M of time. 
In our experiments, we defined three basic performance metrics. Let ed be data to are denoted as rpd , then Racc can be defined as: Rcmp is defined as: Rrdc is defined as: items. From figure 1, we found out that our scheme performs best when the number of Obviously, the more number of items a data set has, the more randomicity of the gen-larity can be referenced. The two figures similarly prove that the experiments perform well if there exists suf-improve the accuracy of popularity identification. that are being broadcasted, their popularity can be inferred based on the valued asso-ciations existing in client requests. The most popular data will continue being broad-method avoids a large number of unnecessary data omissions and thereby reduces the overall client requests.
