 Interest in subjective meaning and individual, inter-personal or social, poetic/creative, and affective di-mensions of language is not new to linguistics or computational approaches to language. Language analysts, including computational linguists, have long acknowledged the importance of such topics (B  X  uhler, 1934; Lyons, 1977; Jakobson, 1996; Halli-day, 1996; Wiebe et al, 2004; Wilson et al, 2005). In computational linguistics and natural language pro-cessing (NLP), current efforts on subjective natural language problems are concentrated on the vibrant field of opinion mining and sentiment analysis (Liu, 2010; T  X  ackstr  X  om, 2009), and ACL-HLT 2011 lists Sentiment Analysis, Opinion Mining and Text Clas-sification as a subject area. The terms subjectivity or subjectivity analysis are also established in the NLP literature to cover these topics of growing inquiry.
The purpose of this opinion paper is not to pro-vide a survey of subjective natural language prob-lems. Rather, it intends to launch discussions about how subjective natural language problems have a vi-tal role to play in computational linguistics and in shaping fundamental questions in the field for the future. An additional point of departure is that a continuing focus on primarily the fundamental dis-tinction of facts vs. opinions (implicitly, denotative vs. connotative meaning) is, alas, somewhat limit-ing. An expanded scope of problem types will bene-fit our understanding of subjective language and ap-proaches to tackling this family of problems.
It is definitely reasonable to assume that problems involving subjective perception, meaning, and lan-guage behaviors will diversify and earn increased at-tention from computational approaches to language. Banea et al already noted:  X  X e have seen a surge in interest towards the application of automatic tools and techniques for the extraction of opinions, emo-tions, and sentiments in text ( subjectivity ) X  (p. 127) (Banea et al, 2008). Therefore, it is timely and use-ful to examine subjective natural language problems from different angles. The following account is an attempt in this direction. The first angle that the pa-per comments upon is what motivates investigatory efforts into such problems. Next, the paper clarifies what subjective natural language processing prob-lems are by providing a few illustrative examples of some relevant problem-solving and application ar-eas. This is followed by discussing yet another an-gle of this family of problems, namely what some of their characteristics are. Finally, potential im-plications for the field of computational linguistics at large are addressed, with the hope that this short piece will spawn continued discussion. The types of problems under discussion here are fundamental language tasks, processes, and phe-nomena that mirror and play important roles in peo-ple X  X  daily social, interactional, or affective lives. Subjective natural language processing problems represent exciting frontier areas that directly re-late to advances in artificial natural language be-havior, improved intelligent access to information, and more agreeable and comfortable language-based human-computer interaction. As just one example, interactional systems continue to suffer from a bias toward  X  X eutral X , unexpressive (and thus commu-nicatively cumbersome) language.

From a practical, application-oriented point of view, dedicating more resources and efforts to sub-jective natural language problems is a natural step, given the wealth of available written, spoken or mul-timodal texts and information associated with cre-ativity, socializing, and subtle interpretation. From a conceptual and methodological perspective, auto-matic subjective text analysis approaches have po-tential to challenge the state of theoretical under-standing, problem-solving methods, and evaluation techniques. The discussion will return to this point in section 5. Subjective natural language problems extend well beyond sentiment and opinion analysis. They in-volve a myriad of topics X  X rom linguistic creativity via inference-based forecasting to generation of so-cial and affective language use. For the sake of illus-tration, four such cases are presented below (bearing in mind that the list is open-ended). 3.1 Case 1: Modeling affect in language A range of affective computing applications apply to language (Picard, 1997). One such area is au-tomatically inferring affect in text. Work on auto-matic affect inference from language data has gener-ally involved recognition or generation models that contrast a range of affective states either along af-fect categories (e.g. angry, happy, surprised, neu-tral, etc.) or dimensions (e.g. arousal and pleasant-ness). As one example, Alm developed an affect dataset and explored automatic prediction of affect in text at the sentence level that accounted for differ-ent levels of affective granularity (Alm, 2008; Alm, 2009; Alm, 2010). There are other examples of the strong interest in affective NLP or affective interfac-ing (Liu et al, 2003; Holzman and Pottenger, 2003; Francisco and Gerv  X  as, 2006; Kalra and Karahalios, 2005; G  X  en  X  ereux and Evans, 2006; Mihalcea and Liu, 2006). Affective semantics is difficult for many au-tomatic techniques to capture because rather than simple text-derived  X  X urface X  features, it requires so-phisticated,  X  X eep X  natural language understanding that draws on subjective human knowledge, inter-pretation, and experience. At the same time, ap-proaches that accumulate knowledge bases face is-sues such as the artificiality and limitations of trying to enumerate rather than perceive and experience hu-man understanding. 3.2 Case 2: Image sense discrimination Image sense discrimination refers to the problem of determining which images belong together (or not) (Loeff et al, 2006; Forsyth et al, 2009). What counts as the sense of an image adds subjective complex-ity. For instance, images capture  X  X oth word and iconographic sense distinctions ... CRANE can re-fer to, e.g. a MACHINE or a BIRD; iconographic distinctions could additionally include birds stand-ing, vs. in a marsh land, or flying, i.e. sense distinc-tions encoded by further descriptive modication in text. X  (p. 547) (Loeff et al, 2006). In other words, images can evoke a range of subtle, subjective mean-ing phenomena. Challenges for annotating images according to lexical meaning (and the use of verifi-cation as one way to assess annotation quality) have been discussed in depth, cf. (Alm et al, 2006). 3.3 Case 3: Multilingual communication The world is multilingual and so are many human language technology users. Multilingual applica-tions have strong potential to grow. Arguably, future generations of users will increasingly demand tools capable of effective multilingual tasking, communi-cation and inference-making (besides expecting ad-justments to non-native and cross-linguistic behav-iors). The challenges of code-mixing include dy-namically adapting sociolinguistic forms and func-tions, and they involve both flexible, subjective sense-making and perspective-taking. 3.4 Case 4: Individualized iCALL A challenging problem area of general interest is language learning. State-of-the-art intelligent computer-assisted language learning (iCALL) ap-proaches generally bundle language learners into a homogeneous group. However, learners are individ-uals exhibiting a vast range of various kinds of dif-ferences. The subjective aspects here are at another level than meaning. Language learners apply per-sonalized strategies to acquisition, and they have a myriad of individual communicative needs, motiva-tions, backgrounds, and learning goals. A frame-work that recognizes subjectivity in iCALL might exploit such differences to create tailored acquisition flows that address learning curves and proficiency enhancement in an individualized manner. Counter-ing boredom can be an additional positive side-effect of such approaches. It must be acknowledged that a problem such as inferring affective meaning from text is a substan-tially different kind of  X  X east X  compared to predict-ing, for example, part-of-speech tags. 1 Identifying such problems and tackling their solutions is also becoming increasingly desirable with the boom of personalized, user-generated contents. It is a use-ful intellectual exercise to consider what the gen-eral characteristics of this family of problems are. This initial discussion is likely not complete; that is also not the scope of this piece. The following list is rather intended as a set of departure points to spark discussion.

It must be recognized that, as one would expect, one cannot  X  X eatly X  separate out problems of this type, but core characteristics such as non-traditional intersubjectivity , variation in human behavior , and recognition of absence of real  X  X round truth X  may be quite useful to understand and appropriately model problems, methods, and evaluation techniques. The cases discussed above in section 3 are just se-lections from the broad range of topics involving aspects of subjectivity, but at least they provide glimpses at what can be done in this area. The list could be expanded to problems intersecting with the digital humanities, healthcare, economics or finance, and political science, but such discussions go be-yond the scope of this paper. Instead the last item on this agenda concerns the broader, disciplinary im-plications that subjective natural language problems raise.

It is important to recognize that there is a broad fam-ily of relevant subjective natural language problems with theoretical and practical, real-world anchoring. The paper has also pointed out that there are certain aspects that deserve special attention. For instance, there are evaluation concepts in computational lin-guistics that, at least to some degree, detract atten-tion away from how subjective perception and pro-duction phenomena actually manifest themselves in natural language. In encouraging a focus on efforts to achieve  X  X igh-performing X  systems (as measured along traditional lines), there is risk involved X  X he sacrificing of opportunities for fundamental insights that may lead to a more thorough understanding of language uses and users. Such insights may in fact decisively advance language science and artificial natural language intelligence.
