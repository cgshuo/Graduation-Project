 In today X  X  computerized and information-based society, we are soaked with vast amounts of text data, ranging from news articles, scientific publications, product reviews, to a wide range of textual information from social media. To unlock the value of these unstructured text data from various domains, it is of great importance to gain an understanding of entities and their relationships.

In this tutorial, we introduce data-driven methods to rec-ognize typed entities of interest in massive, domain-specific text corpora. These methods can automatically identify to-ken spans as entity mentions in documents and label their types ( e.g. , people, product, food) in a scalable way. We demonstrate on real datasets including news articles and tweets how these typed entities aid in knowledge discovery and management.
 Motivation: Entity recognition/typing and structured anal-ysis of massive text corpora. The success of database tech-nology is largely attributed to the efficient and effective man-agement of structured data. The construction of a well-structured database is often the premise of consequent ap-plications. Although the majority of existing data generated in our society is unstructured, big data leads to big oppor-tunities to uncover structures of real-world entities, such as people, products and organizations, from massive amount but inter-related unstructured data. By mining token spans of entity mentions in documents, labeling their structured types and inferring their relations, it is possible to construct semantically rich structures and provide conceptual summa-rization of such data. The uncovered structures will facili-tate browsing information and retrieving knowledge that are otherwise locked in the data.
 Example: Entity recognition and typing in Yelps reviews. In a business review corpus like Yelp reviews 1 , entities such as http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge This tutorial presents a comprehensive overview of the tech-niques developed for entity recognition in recent years. We will discuss the following key issues.
 Recognition and typing of entities from massive, un-structured text corpora We introduce the background of entity recognition and typ-ing problem. We will provide examples on different docu-mentary data collections where entities are explicitly typed and linked with documents, or need to be extracted or in-ferred from the text data. We demonstrate the growing needs on recognizing and typing entities for a wide range of applications including information extraction and knowl-edge base population.
 Entity mention detection We discuss different paradigms and methodologies for de-tecting entity mention in text data, ranging from super-vised learning, unsupervised approaches, to distant super-vised methods. We introduce efforts to combine corpus statistics from massive document collection with a variety of document-level features, and to leverage distant super-vision from structured knowledge bases. We demonstrate the benefits of various phrase mining-based approaches over traditional supervised entity detection methods.
 Entity recognition in a single document We outline different supervised methods for recognizing typed entities in a single, general-domain document. We discuss the limitations of these methods when they are applied to single, domain-specific document such as business review and tweet. We introduce previous work on designing meth-ods that can specifically handle different domains. We fur-ther demonstrate efforts towards recognizing fine-grained entity types and adopting distant supervision from large amount of external knowledge sources.
 Entity recognition in a massive, domain-specific text corpus Often times, it is hard to obtain label data for a large, domain-specific and dynamic text corpus. We demonstrate efforts on data-driven entity recognition and typing meth-ods to more effectively model the data redundancy in the massive text corpus. We focus on the problem of entity recognition and typing with distant supervision and demon-strate the benefits of leveraging rich entity information in structured, semantically-rich knowledge bases. We demon-strate how creating information networks that embody the interaction between different text units in text can assist in high-quality entity typing. We argue that such a network mining approach can holistically model the corpus-level in-formation in a principled way.
 Evaluation, Case Studies and Recent Progress We outline different evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets for named-entity recognition (NER), and introduce several popular NER systems and NER shared tasks. We discuss the findings from applying different NER methods on new article domain and Yelp review domain. We outline the recent progress on combining entity recognition with other related text mining tasks, extracting entities from multiple data sources, integrating NER results from multiple systems, and applying deep learning for NER.
