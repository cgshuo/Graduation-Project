 This pape r investigates how users cognitively coordinate multitasking Web search across different information search problems. The analysis suggests that (1) multitasking is a prevalent Web search behavior including both sequential multitasking (31%) and parallel multitasking (69%); (2) multitasking is performed through a task switching process; and (3) such a process is supported and underpinned by cognitive coordination mechanisms and strategy coordination.

Recent Web query log studies show that multitask searching is a common human information retrieval behavior . Many users conduct information searching on multiple related or unrelated topics and also switch between the topics, with a mean of 2.1 topic changes per search session [5]. Buzikashvili X  X  multitasking study based on the automatic task session detection procedure further reported that more than 98% search sessions were sequential execution, during which a searcher executed tasks one-by -one . This is in contrast to only 1% parallel execution, during which a user interrupted one task, started and completed the second task, and returned to the interrupted task later [1]. Unfortunately, previous multitasking Web search studies did not examine the type and complexity of multiple search tasks switching in detail. Existing research limits findings to information tasks level. The literature of psychology and cognitive sciences, however demonstrates that multitasking behavior is correlated closely to humans X  cognitive processing and coordination capabilities [2]. The cognitive executive control systems govern processes including the selection, initiation, execution and termination of each task [4]. People could consciously trade-off performing one task for the other stemmed from their coordination capability. Cognitive coordination allows humans to manage the dependencies among tasks and the resources available [3]. The research presented in this poster is part of an investigation of multitasking and coordination behavior in Web search. This poster examines the following research questions: (1) what are characteristics of multitasking and task switching during Web search? and (2) how do users cognitively coordinate between multiple information search problems? In multitasking Web search, the number of submitted search queries varied from 4 to 39, with a mean of 18; the number of employed Web search systems varied from 1 to 10, with a mean of 4; and the mean number of browsed windows/tabs was 17 (Table 1). The results show the complexity of multitasking behavior involving users X  interactions with Web technologies. The study participants were found to switch between searching on original information problems (SOIP) and searching on evolving information problems (SEIP). A process of 275 searching task switches over the 42 Web searches was identified, with 6 task switches per multitasking search. People handled the demands of multiple tasks sequentially or interleaving through task switching, namely, sequential multitasking or parallel multitasking (Table 2), accounting for 31% and 69% of Web searches, respectively. For sequential mu ltitasking, study participants spent an average of 12 minutes per task before switching to another task. In contrast, parallel multitasking study participants spent an average of only 8 minutes on one task before switching to another. Based on the content analysis of search-utterance segments (combin ing search logs and transcribed think-aloud audio data), we found that the occurrence of cognitive coordination played an active role in multitasking and task switching activities. Multitasking and task switching were underpinned and supported by cognitive coordination processes including coordination mechanism and strategy coordination. Coordination mechanism involved a conscious reasoning and judging process  X  most of these were content relevance feedback of making relevance judgments on the returned results, and self-learning and regulating process of making sense of the gathered information. Coordination mechanism was identified as the most important reason for users X  task switching behavior (Table 2 last column, 45% for sequential multitasking and 95% for parallel multitasking). Multitasking Web search was cognitively constructed as users learned with information attainment during the process. Evidence c an be elicited from study participants X  utterance, such as  X  X  have found enough related information , I X  X  move on to next information problem  X  (SP37) ,  X  X  did not think the information was useful, I might change the keywords X  (SP13), and  X  X ince this problem [OIP3] is about a tour available in Malaysia, I just quickly check the visitor visa [EIP1]  X  (SP8). Strategy coordination was a strategic plan for solving multiple information problems within the resources available. Strategy coordination was viewed as the second most important reason
