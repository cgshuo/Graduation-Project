A little over 10 years ago, I have had the pleasure and the privilege to take over as Editor-in-Chief of Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence after Professor Leo Motus, who had led the Journal for 7 years.
 In those 10 years a lot has changed. At that time, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence was still accepting hardcopy manuscript submissions, sent in by post, to editors all around the world. The manuscripts were then dispatched, via post, to reviewers, who sent back their reviews back, via post. Finally, the editors were able to get back to the authors of the manuscripts with a first assessment of their manuscripts, via post. The Journal started do some experiments with electronic reviewing in the 1990s, but in the end only introduced manuscript handling in 2002, taking out a part of the long loop. Indeed, the manuscripts were submitted electronically and the feedback was sent back to the authors via the same system. The reviewing correspondance with the reviewers of the manuscripts had to be done outside the system. Then, in 2005, the presently used electronic manuscript handling system was introduced, that allows for a complete coherent manuscript handling between authors, editors, and reviewers (and in the end through to the publishers).

Of course, the introduction and deployment of electronic manuscript handling has had tremendous impacts on the running of Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence . The different regional offices were no longer really necessary, and a new structure for the Editorial Board was set up, so to better support this new era of manuscript handling.

As a direct result of the electronic manuscript submission era, the number of submitted papers has gone up from about a 100 papers per year at the end of the 1990s to close to 600 in 2009. Thanks to the excellent cooperation with our Publishers, we have been able to increase step-by-step the page budget so to be able to publish the best papers; the number of pages has increased gradually from about 600 pages at the end of the 1990s (6 issues per year) to 1200 pages today (over 8 issues).

At the same time, the appreciation of our Journal has improved. Frequently the Impact Factor is used to measure this appreciation, as an independent measure on the level of the papers published in scientific journals. For Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence the impact factor has gradually gone up from about 0.2 in the 1990s, to close to 1.4 in 2009.
Also at the content-side of the Journal one can see important changes of the past 10 years. Where 10 years ago there was still a very important focus on expert system techniques, today one can see a much bigger focus on evolutionary systems, fuzzy logic, etc. A clear shift can be observed and it will be interesting to see where the Journal will go to over the next few years.

Since 1995, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence was an IFAC affiliated Journal, linked to the IFAC Technical Committee Artificial Intelligence in Real-Time Control. Given the success in this connection between the Journal and the Technical Commit-tee, IFAC decided in 2002 to make Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence a full IFAC Journal, next to, at that time, Automatica and Control Engineering Practice.

For me, the time has now come to step aside, and leave the place to my successor, Professor Bernard Grabot of the University of Toulouse, France. Bernard has a very broad knowledge on artificial intelligence techniques and a specific know-how on supply chain management and fuzzy logic.

I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the editors and reviewers who have worked for our Journal over the past years; their efforts have been, and are, the key to the success and the quality of the Journal. I also would like to wish Bernard Grabot and Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence all the best for the coming years.

Professor Grabot has already started to lay down the lines for further improvements to the Journal, and I am sure that under his new leadership Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence will have all the possibilities to continue to grow, to allow you as authors to get your work published, and to allow you as readers to get access to interesting work.
 With very best wishes,
 After having been active for Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence in different roles and finally as Deputy-Editor-in-Chief, I feel honoured to succeed Rob Vingerhoeds as Editor-in-Chief of the journal.

In his editorial (see the previous issue of EAAI), Rob has summarized some key issues highlighting the evolution of the journal over the last ten years. He mentioned in particular volume of submissions, papers published and impact factor as indicators of the evolution. Whereas the introduction and the generalisation of electronic submission is one driver of this evolution, the improved links between the journal and IFAC are equally important.

I would like to thank Rob for his tremendous work as Editor-in-Chief, which has allowed the journal to evolve to its present state. At the same time, as did Rob, I would like to thank the people  X  X  X ehind the scenes X  X , Editors, reviewers, and authors, who have all in their way contributed to this success. I would like to take the opportunity to introduce to you Professor Rainer Unland, until now one of our Editors, who has accepted the position of Deputy-Editor-in-Chief, and who will work along with me to continue the development of the journal.
 The role of Editor of a journal such as EAAI is a demanding task. You will certainly have noticed regular changes in the Editorial Board, mainly motivated by reorientations in the scientific activities of our Editors.

In relation with the constantly increasing number of submitted papers, I would like to re-emphasise the positioning of the journal in the ever growing landscape of scientific publications.
Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence is targeting practising scientists and engineers in Artificial Intelligence Technology and its application in Engineering. This includes both theory and application oriented papers. For theoretical papers, the journal aims at novel techniques/architectures and their applica-tion in engineering. For more application-oriented papers, the journal wants the application to bring new knowledge to the targeted readership.

An important aspect of this area is that AI has greatly matured since 1987, the year of creation of the journal. Twenty years ago, most AI tools were still rather new and were looking for their first applications. Other approaches were not even created. At that time, implementing existing AI tools on real engineering pro-blems was a challenge and involved real research work. Nowa-days, many tools or techniques have been the object of hundreds or thousands of industrial applications (like expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy reasoning, case based reasoning, etc.). Given this changed situation, simply describing a new application of a known technique is no longer considered by the Journal as a paper for our targeted readership. Therefore, the Journal aims to publish papers describing innovative applications, i.e. applications requiring new tools, or at least adaptation or improvement of existing ones. This also includes real lessons learned, detailed comparisons with other techniques, etc. The aim should always be that there is something that our targeted readership can learn from.

The reviewing process is a key aspect in the life of every scientific journal. Peer-reviewed journals aim at having all submitted manuscripts that are suitable for publication reviewed by independent researchers to ensure the quality of the papers that are in the end retained for publication. Many authors ask  X  X  X ow long will the review take? X  X  Behind this apparently simple question lies the major issue of scientific publication: the peer review process as mentioned above. This issue is similar for all scientific journals, and many are struggling to find suitable reviewers, who are doing the reviews on a voluntary basis and within a reasonable amount of time. Many reviewers never reply to invitations to review a paper, some decline and even of those who accept sometimes never finish it due to overloading. Reviewers are all busy people working for free and on a voluntary basis. A problem is the lack of recognition in their universities and research institutes, who prefer that they spend time on publishing papers or getting funding from external sources. Following the proposal of Philippe Baveye in his recent editorial in the Journal of Hydrology we would like to invite Elsevier and the other publishers to think about an  X  X  X -Index X  X , which would express the quantitative effort made by a researcher for reviewing. Provided by each journal, this index would allow the reviewers to better argue on this part of their scientific commitment towards their university (or employer in case of reviewers from industry). Provided by a large publisher, or by several ones, it would give a major indicator of the recognition of a person, and of its efforts for the scientific community.

My objective as Editor-in-Chief of EAAI is now to consolidate the journal that has grown up to its present level .Thanks to my predecessors. I believe that it is now more important than ever to attract and publish the best papers of the field: this is the challenge that we all have to address, as editors, reviewers, authors y and readers.


In recent years, metaheuristics have become important tools for solving hard optimization problems encountered in industry as well as in the theoretical field. Many different metaheuristics exist (and new ones are under constant development). Some of the most famous ones are evolutionary algorithms, Tabu search, simulated annealing, Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Proce-dures (GRASP), ant systems, memetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, etc. This special issue aims at bringing together outstanding research and recent developments in the field of metaheuristics and their applications in the industrial world.
This feature issue includes 17 papers that cannot be easily divided into groups, since they cover a very wide variety of topics.
Some of them develop variants of well established methods (Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony Optimization, Variable Neighborhood Search, GRASP,
Evolutionary Algorithms, Differential Evolution). Others are interested in the design of new methods, which are either based on original approaches (e.g. Reduced Space Searching algorithm) or most often built by hybridizing classical metaheuristics. Some papers are focused on particular features of the field (namely, multi-objective or dynamic optimization). Above all, the accepted papers deal with a wide assortment of applications (system identification, manufacturing processes, image processing, elec-tronics, routing, ad hoc networks, scheduling, project manage-ment, etc). Accordingly, no classification is really relevant, so that we simply present the papers in the order of their submission.
In the first paper, by Bipul Luitel and Ganesh K. Venayaga-moorthy, Particle Swarm Optimization with Quantum Infusion (PSO-QI) is used in identification of benchmark infinite impulse response systems and a real world problem in power systems. PSO-QI X  X  performance is compared with PSO and Differential
Evolution PSO (DEPSO) algorithms. The results show that PSO-QI has better performance over these algorithms in identifying dynamical systems.

In the next paper, Monaldo Mastrolilli and Christian Blum point out that many metaheuristics are either based on neighbor-hood search or the construction of solutions. Recent algorithmic variants include two important features: the use of bounds for evaluating partial solutions, and the parallel and non-indepen-dent construction of solutions. The authors give a theoretical reason of why these algorithms generally work very well in practice. Then, they confirm their theoretical findings by means of practical examples.

In the next paper, an optimization algorithm based on a new reduced space searching strategy is presented by Qian Zhang and
Mahdi Mahfouf. This algorithm originates from an idea relating to a simple experience: when humans search for a candidate solution given a certain objective, a large area tends to be scanned first. Should one succeed in finding clues in relation to the predefined objective, then the search space is greatly reduced for a more detailed search. This new algorithm is extended to the multi-objective optimization case.

Siarry, presents both adaptation and comparison of six metaheur-istic techniques to solve the multilevel image thresholding problem: a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), ant colony, simulated annealing and tabu search. Experimental results notably show that GA, PSO and DE are much better in terms of precision, robustness and time convergence than the three other competing algorithms. and Ajith Abraham, presents an application of a recent swarm intelligence technique, namely Artificial Bee Colony, to extract the small signal equivalent circuit model parameters of GaAs Metal
Extended Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MESFET) device and compares its performance with that of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.
 ing for controlling node voltages in a power network. A widely used solution is based on adjusting the taps in under load tap changers (ULTCs) power transformers. The aim of this 6th paper, by Francisco G. Montoya, Rau  X  l Ban  X  os, Consolacio  X  n Gil, Antonio
Esp X   X  n, Alfredo Alcayde and Julio Go  X  mez, is to evaluate the performance of several multi-objective algorithms, in order to minimize both voltage deviation and power losses by operating ULTCs located in high voltage substations.
 characteristics of an aircraft starting from a set of requirements.
These studies can be summarized as global constrained optimiza-tion problems, which are currently manually conducted, as many input data frequently evolve during the study. This paper by
Ce  X  line Badufle, Christophe Blondel, Thierry Druot, Christian B es and Jean-Baptiste Hiriart-Urruty introduces mathematical meth-ods that are useful in a sizing tool to ease, fasten and enhance the aircraft configuration optimization problem.
 satisfying assignment that makes a Boolean expression evaluate to True. The growing need for more efficient and scalable algorithms has led to the development of a large number of solvers. This paper by Noureddine Bouhmala and Ole-Christoffer
Granmo reports the first approach that combines finite learning automata with the greedy satisfiability algorithm. That algorithm is validated through a benchmark set containing randomized and structured problems from various domains.
 The next paper by Idel Montalvo, Joaqu X   X  n Izquierdo, Rafael Pe  X  rez-Garc X   X  a and Manuel Herrera deals with a new variant of
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in which no, a priori, parameter tuning is necessary. In this paper, within a framework that also includes other variants previously introduced by the authors, the algorithm X  X  parameters are coevolved with the particles. Experiments are performed on two benchmarking problems from the literature, namely the Hanoi water supply system and the New York tunnel water supply system.

Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problems (WCSP) are used to model and to solve constraint optimization problems. In this paper, Samir Loudni, Patrice Boizumault and Nicolas Levasseur propose new generic neighborhood heuristics dedicated to WCSP.
Their heuristics take advantage of both conflicted variables and the topology of the constraints graph. Experiments are reported on real life instances as well as random instances.
 In the next paper, Safa Khalouli, Fatima Ghedjati and Abdelaziz
Hamzaoui address a hybrid flow shop scheduling problem, considering the minimization of the sum of the total earliness and tardiness penalties. Their algorithm based on an ant colony approach is tested by numerical experiments, on a large number of randomly generated problems. A comparison is presented with the performance achieved by some constructive heuristics.
The next paper, by Li Liu and S. Ranji Ranjithan, proposes an evolutionary-based adaptive algorithm for solving time-dependent optimization problems. The purpose of this approach is to identify the current optimal solution as well as a set of alternatives. The resultant solutions may then serve for the subsequent search while change is occurring. That algorithm avoids the clustering of individuals in the same region, as well as adapts to changing environments, by exploiting diverse promising regions in the solution space. The next paper, by Juan G. Villegas, Christian Prins, Caroline
Prodhon, Andre  X  s L. Medaglia and Nubia Velasco, addresses the single truck and trailer routing problem with satellite depots: a vehicle composed of a truck with a detachable trailer serves the demand of a set of customers reachable only by the truck without the trailer. The problem is solved through two metaheuristics based on greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, variable neighborhood descent and evolutionary local search.

J. Garcia-Nieto, Jamal Toutouh and E. Alba are interested in the emerging field of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), which deals with a set of communicating vehicles that are able to spontaneously interconnect without any pre-existing infrastructure. The problem they consider in this paper lies in configuring the File Transfer protocol Configuration, with the aim of optimizing the transmission time, the number of lost packets, and the amount of data transferred in realistic VANET scenarios.

In the next paper, by Hui Cheng and Shengxiang Yang, the problem of dynamic quality-of-service multicast routing in mobile ad hoc networks is investigated. In the construction of the dynamic network environments, two models are investigated. In the first one, called general dynamics model, the topologies are changed since the nodes are scheduled to sleep or wake up. In the other, namely the worst dynamics model, the topologies are altered because some links on the current best multicast tree are removed.

Optimization of directional over-current relay settings is an important problem in electrical engineering. It turns out to be nonlinear and highly constrained in which two settings, namely time dial setting and plug setting, of each relay are considered as decision variables. To solve the problem, Radha Thangaraj, Millie Pant and Kusum Deep have applied five newly developed versions of differential evolution. The results are compared with the classical DE algorithm and with five more algorithms available in the literature.

A better integration of preliminary product design and project management processes at early steps of system design is nowa-days a key industrial issue. In this paper, Paul Pitiot, Thierry Coudert, Laurent Geneste and Claude Baron propose a model for integrated product/project optimization, which uses a multi-objective optimization technique, to provide managers with appropriate scenarios, in a reasonable amount of time. That approach is based on the interaction between an adapted evolutionary algorithm and a model of knowledge.

I do hope you will find this special issue interesting and thought provoking.
