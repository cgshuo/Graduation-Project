 Proper name transliteration, the pronunciation-based translation of a proper name from a source language to a desired target language, is important to many multilingual natural language processing tasks, including Cross Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), multilingual spoken document retrieval and Machine Translation (MT). Tra-ditionally, transliteration is achieved by human translators using hand-crafted transla-information, more and more proper names become undefined in the lexicon. These undefined proper names can be referred as Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) word, and potentially introduce harm to the system performance, especially in CLIR task. Since proper names usually carry distinctive information, when not carefully handled, the mean average precision (mAP) can reach 50% degradation [1]. Transliteration between languages that use irrelevant alphabets and phonemes, e.g. English and Chinese or English and Arabic is especially challenging [1-4]. Due to the pronunciation differences between the source and target languages, particular pho-nemes in the source language can either have no corresponding phoneme or have a few close phonemes in the target language. These pronunciation differences usually yield  X  X any to one X ,  X  X ne to many X  or  X  X ne to none X  phoneme mappings. Thus, one proper name can be transliterated into multiple foreign names with similar pronuncia-tion outcomes in the target language. In addition, because of homophones, a single proper name can be transliterated to multiple foreign names with identical pronuncia-transliterated into  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X ,  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X ,  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  and so on. These varieties can significantly degrade the CLIR performance when a different set of transliterations was used by the query and its relevant documents. Despite that the state-of-the-art statistical machine transla tion (SMT) techniques have been developed, Hence, alternative methodology that targets mu ltiple transliter ations is indispensible. 
Proper name CLIR was mostly tackled by two essential steps [1, 4-6]: (1) one or multiple alternative transliterations were generated for each unknown word using the retrieval module. However, two potential problems remained unaddressed. Firstly, ment collection. An approximate string matching technique is usually required to alleviate this drawback. Secondly, the retrieval performance will be compromised if To our best knowledge, no unified framework has been used to seamlessly integrate transliteration and retrieval model. Therefore, we proposed a novel transliteration retrieval model that incorporates a transliteration similarity function into the relevance scoring mechanism as a single component. The proposed framework computes the quires and documents are represented in two irrelevant languages. In this framework, we employed an efficient and robust method to measure the similarity of a given proper name pair using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based alignment. Related work in CLIR can be roughly grouped into two major categories [7]: (1) translating the query into the language us ed in the document collection and (2) incor-collection, the remaining retrieval procedure can be derived from the standard ad hoc method. In the second category, researches have attempted to apply the statistical Language Model (LM) to CLIR [8-10]. The LM aims to capture the regularity in human natural language and to quantify the acceptability of a given word sequence. The basic idea is that a document is deemed to be relevant to a query if its corresponding document language model is more likely to generate the query. A probabilistic language model is developed explicitly for each individual document in the collection. Therefore, the translation probability translation model that handles all the possible proper name translation. 
The proper name transliteration was often modeled by the SMT framework. Virga Chinese characters for Mandarin spoken document retrieval [4]. Knight and Graehl proposed a generative transliteration model for Japanese and English using finite state transducers [11]. Meng et al. developed an English-Chinese Named Entity (NE) trans-literation technique using a pr onunciation lexicon and phon etic mapping rules [3]. Most of the above statistical machine tran slation approaches were based on the IBM noisy source-channel model framework [12]. Instead of using the noisy source-channel model, Gao et al. proposed a direct modeling approach to estimate the poste-rior probability using phoneme chunks as the contextual features [13]. Li et al. proposed direct orthographic mapping with a joint source-channel model for proper name transliteration [14]. Kumaran and Kellner [15] also implemented a generic transliteration framework using an approach similar to [14]. On the other hand, due to the challenge of machine transliteration, additional data source such as comparable corpora and web were explored to improve the performance [16-17]. All of these approaches had a scoring mechanism to test how likely a given pair of names in source and target languages is the transliteration of each other. This is a key compo-nent and is the aspect we focus on in this paper. 
One popular approach for proper name CLIR is to translate queries from the source language to the target language. IR module is then applied for document retrieval. By this approach, the CLIR is addressed by two separated tasks. For the LM based IR, a probabilistic language model is developed explicitly for each individual document in In this paper, we propose a unified framework which integrates the proper name transliteration similarity measurement into the retrieval model. proposed transliteration retrieval model. We then present our approach to calculate proper name transliteration similarity in latter section. 3.1 Retrieval Model In language model based IR, a probabilistic generative framework is used for ranking each document D in the collection by a given query Q . This concept can be de-scribed by hood of Q generated by D , i.e., treated as a probabilistic language model for generating the query. If Q is treated as a sequence of words, N w w w Q " 2 1 = , which is assumed to be independent of each assumption), the relevance measure probabilities of the query words generated by the document: where document ranking is now simplified by the document model way to construct collection can respectively offer a unigram distribution for observing a query word. 
A similar notion can be applied to CLIR by introducing the translation probability Chinese document term 1 [19]. The retrieval model for CLIR given the English query Q and the Chinese document f D can be formulated as: estimate the translation probability of function as where by the following sigmoid operation: The weight  X  and  X  describe the steepness and central of the sigmoid function, respectively. The the document term f w . This sigmoid function is introduced to converts the similarity measure, propriate transliteration. 3.2 Transliteration Similarity target language, our goal here is to explore approaches with reliable similarity scoring mechanism which yields high accuracy with low computational complexity. For ease of illustration, we choose English and Chinese name transliteration for this study. 
Intuitively, proper name transliteration  X  X ranslates X  a proper name from the source language to the target language based on pronunciation. Phonetic based edit distance measures should provide a good evaluation method. However, the source and target language can have very different base phone sets. One has to convert these phone sets between the source and target languages, the phone set mapping can be  X  X ne to many X ,  X  X any to one X  or  X  X ne to none X . Additionally, pronunciation difference be-tween some phone pairs can be more significant than the other pairs. For example, the similarity measure rather than phonetic based edit distance. Some linguistic back-ground may help hand craft the phone set mapping rules with weights. Instead, we use a phonetic based SMT framework to derive the mapping rules. 
We propose a left-to-right discrete HMM based alignment to measure the similar-verted to phone sequences. In the discrete HMM alignment, we treat each phone to be aligned as a state which is characterized by a multinomial distribution. The emission given by phone in source language probability model is presented by either framework can be utilized to derive the state emission probability state transition is from left to right with self looping, and with the maximum jump of can be calculated by the dynamic time wrapping (DTW). The similarity score is the best alignment score normalized by the total length. The parallel training corpus for SMT to derive p(f|e) is organized as such that the Chinese phone sequences (in Chinese phone set). Words with multiple pronunciations are fully enumerated. The SMT models are developed by a commonly used recipe [22]. The phrase table alignment. The phrase table size is set to 2. Thus, one or two phone sequences in the source language can mapped to one or two phone sequences in the target language and vice versa. Please refer to [24] for more details. Two consecutive experiments were setup to verify the proposed framework. The first experiment is to assess the performance of proper name transliteration similarity measurement. To this end, a parallel corpus consisting of English and Chinese proper name pairs was extracted from the people section of the multilingual Wikipedia. Ap-proximately 3,000 pairs were used for training and 300 pairs for testing. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed similarity measurement, match and unmatched condi-tions were both tested. The 300 pairs were used as a matched condition test. A sepa-rated 1,000 unmatched test pairs were created randomly from the 300 matched pairs. The English and Chinese pronunciations were obtained by the IBM voice toolkits. Multiple pronunciations for a given word were considered to be uniformly distributed. All possible combinations of pronunciation were created in both training and test set. The second experiment is document retrieval using the data compiled from the NTCIR-7 Information Retrieval for Question Answering (IR4QA) task [20]. IR4QA evaluates the performance of document retrieval using Average Precision (AP) met-this study, we used the EN-CS (English to Simplified Chinese) subtask, which in-cludes 545,162 documents and 97 queries, for the retrieval experiments. Of the origi-verify our proposed method. The retrieval results were presented by AP. We first evaluated the performance of the proper name transliteration similarity measurement. The phonetic based transliteration SMT system was developed. The log score for both matched and unmatched proper name pair test set. A larger value repre-pair is higher than the threshold, this pair is falsely accepted. The performance metrics rejection of matched pairs and the false acceptance of unmatched pairs are identical. The EER for our proposed method was 3.47%. This low EER provides a good foun-dation for proper name CLIR. For comparison, the transliteration employing the commonly used SMT framework was also explored. The translation of a given phone sequence from the source language to the target language was performed. The similar-ity of the translated phone sequence and true target phone sequence was calculated using BLEU score [23]. While setting the phrase table size equal to 8, the SMT framework yielded the best performance at the EER of 7.1%, which is substantially higher than that of our approach. We also compared the edit distance between spelling of English name and Pinyin of Chinese names. The EER for the orthographic based edit distance is 22%. Table 1 summarizes these results. monolingual task (CS-CS) using entire 97 queries. The unigram document language model ter  X  is determined by maximizing the leave-one-out log likelihood of the entire document collection [21]. The AP of this approach is 0.5764. The best performance for this query set from the NTCIR report is 0.6184 and the average AP from all par-ticipated systems is 0.4276. Our monolingual baseline retrieval model is comparable to the best systems of the NCTIR-7 report. We then performed retrieval experiment using the 10 proper name query topics. Our baseline yielded overall AP of 0.6911, which outperformed the average AP 2 of 0.4894 from all systems (cf. Table 2). However, while examining the AP of each individual query topic, our baseline performed is worse than the average for the query ACLIA-CS-T42. The reason is that the proper name  X  X in Laden X  has been transliter-ated as  X   X  X  X  X   X ,  X   X  X  X  X   X , and so on, in the document collection. This multiple transliterations degrade the performance of our baseline, which uses words as the indexing unit. To address the problem of ACLIA-CS-T42 query topic, it is necessary similarity function into the retrieval model (cf. Eq. (3)). To evaluate the performance of proposed approach, we needed the document collection equipped with controlled multiple transliterations. We created a homogenous name list for those proper names document collections. The homogenous names list and associated Pinyin are shown in document collection was presented at Table 3 (denoted as  X  Synthetic  X ). When a proper name has n alternatives, the performance degradation will be approximately ( n / n +1). We then evaluated the proposed method against the synthetic collection document. can be the Oracle results of our approach (denoted by  X  Oracle  X  in Table 4). The Ora-cle results outperform the baseline results for query topics  X  X CLIA-CS-T42 X  and  X  X CLIA-CS-T367 X , which suggests that the original document collection may have performs the baseline in a few query topics. This performance improvement can stem from the segmentation error. For example, if  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X s included in the document lexicon, it might be a mis-segmentation of  X   X  X  X   X   X , whereas our approach is able to retrieve this document . However, this experiment is impractical since the complete list of transliterations for the document collection is unknown. 
Next, we manually tagged 2,000 candidate proper names from the document col-lection for similarity function evaluation. These 2,000 candidate proper names are related to the homogenous name list. At least one character from the candidate proper name has a similar pronunciation to the homogenous name list. This test data was used to evaluate the robustness of our approach against the false acceptance of OOVs.  X  used in sigmoid operation (cf. Eq. (4)) were optimized based on the experiments shown in Table 1 (with an EER of 4.3%). The corresponding results were shown in Table 4 (denoted by  X  Taggers  X ). The average of all APs was degraded slightly from 0.7254 to 0.6516, while compared to the Oracle results. 
Last, we evaluated the worse scenario by using the vocabulary from the complete scenario when the Named Entities (NE) tagger is not available. This test scenario created the maximum number of false acceptance of OOVs. The average AP for this experiment drops from the Oracle performance of 0.7254 to 0.4040 (denoted by trieval approach on synthetic document collection. The results clearly showed that our proposed transliteration retrieval model and the low EER of similarity function can properly handle the multiple proper name transliteration problems. Even without the NE tagger (cf.  X  Worst  X  in Table 4), the proposed method provides significant im-provements over the baseline of the synthetic document collection. Due to the diversity of proper name transliteration, the transliteration accuracy can be impaired, leading to performance degradation in proper name CLIR. We proposed a unified transliteration retrieval framework which integrates the transliteration similar-ity measurement into the relevance scoring function. Instead of performing proper The EER of the proposed similarity function can be as low as 3.5%, which reduces the negative impact of proper name CLIR due to the uncertainty of transliteration. The CLIR experiments were conducted using the NTCIR7 IR4QA dataset. The cor-proper names severely degraded the IR performance. The CLIR performance was recovered by our proposed method.
