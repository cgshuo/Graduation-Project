 Design of cortically implanted neural prosthetic sensors ( CINPS)is an active area of research in the rapidly emerging field of brain machine interfaces (BMI) [1, 2]. The core technology used in these sensors are micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) that facil itate real-time recording from thousands ure 1) and transmitted to an off-scalp neural processor whic h controls the movement of a prosthetic process high-dimensional signals generated at the interfa ce of micro-electrode arrays [3, 4]. Sen-sor arrays consisting of more than 1000 recording elements a re common [5, 6] which significantly sion and transmitting the recorded neural signals ( at a samp ling rate of 10 KHz) can easily exceed the power dissipation limit of 80 mW/cm 2 determined by local heating of biological tissue [7]. In control of neural prosthesis [3].
 One of the solutions that have been proposed by several resea rchers is to perform compression of common-mode effects introduces unwanted redundancy at the output of the electrode array [4]. As a result, neural signals typically occupy only a small sub-s pace within the high-dimensional space spanned by the micro-electrode signals. An optimal strateg y for designing a multi-channel analog-to-digital converter is to identify and operate within the s ub-space spanned by the neural signals and in the process eliminate cross-channel redundancy. To a chieve this goal, in this paper we pro-of the data converter to micro-electrode arrays and signal p rocessing modules pose to use large margin principles [10], which have been hig hly successful in high-dimensional information processing [11, 10]. Our approach will be to for malize a cost function consisting of L expansion. Within this framework the correlation distance between the channels will be minimized which amounts to searching for signal spaces that are maxima lly separated from each other. The architecture called multiple-input multiple-output ( MIMO)  X  X  converter is the first reported data conversion technique to embed large margin principles . The approach, however, is generic and can be extended to designing higher order ADC. To illustrate the concept of MIMO A/D conversion, the paper is organized as follows: section 2 introduces a reg ularization framework for the proposed MIMO data converter and introduces the min-max gradient des cent approach. Section 3 applies the technique to simulated and recorded neural data. Section 4 c oncludes with final remarks and future directions. In this section we introduce an optimization framework for d eriving MIMO  X  X  converters. For the where each dimension represents a single channel in the mult i-electrode array. It is also assumed matrix A  X  X  M  X  M and an regression weight vector w  X  X  M . Consider the following optimization problem where and 1 represents a column vector whose elements are unity. The cos t function in equation 2 consists of two factors: the first factor is an L second factor that maximizes the correlation between vecto r w and an input vector x transformed using a linear projection denoted by matrix A . The choice of L in equation (2) will become clear when we present its corresp onding gradient update rule. To ensure that the optimization problem in equation 1 is well defined, t he norm of the input vector || x || will be assumed to be bounded.
 Under bounded condition, the closed form solution to optimi zation problem in equation 1 can be found to be w  X  = 0 . From the perspective of A/D conversion we will show that the iterative steps minimizing 1 at iteration n is given by where  X  &gt; 0 is defined as the learning rate. The choice of L w  X  . Combining equation (3) with equation (2) the following rec ursion is obtained: where ers [9] coupled together by the linear transform A . If we assume that the norm of matrix || A || is bounded, it can be shown that || w equation 4 yields which using the bounded property of w asymptotically leads to as N  X  X  X  .
 Therefore consistent with the theory of  X  X  conversion [9] the moving average of vector digital increases. It can also be shown that N update steps yields a digital representation which is log bits accurate. 2.1 Online adaptation and compression The next step is to determine the form of the matrix A which parameterize the family of linear transformations spanning the signal space. The aim of optim izing for A is to find multi-channel signal configuration that is maximally separated from each o ther. For this purposes we denote one independent component analysis (ICA) based approaches [12 ], where the objective is to search for maximally independent signal space including the referenc e channel. Even though several forms of the matrix A = [ a A is chosen to be a lower triangular matrix such that a ij = 0; i &lt; j and a ij = 1; i = j . The choice of a lower triangular matrix ensures that the matrix A is always invertible. It also implies that the first channel is unaffected by the proposed transfor m A and will be the reference channel. The problem of compression or redundancy elimination is the refore to optimize the cross-elements a ij , i 6 = j minimized. This can be written as a min-max optimization cri terion where an inner optimization performs analog-to-digital conversion, where as the outer loop adapts the linear transform matrix A such as to maximize the margin of separation between the resp ective signal spaces. This can be denoted by the following equation: a gradient ascent step given by hardware implementation by considering only the sign of the regression vector w [ n ] and the input vector x as The update rule in equation 10 bears strong resemblance to on line update rules used in independent component analysis (ICA) [12, 13]. The difference with the p roposed technique however is the integrated data conversion coupled with spatial decorrela tion/compression. The output of the MIMO  X  X  converter is a digital stream whose pulse density is proport ional to the transformed input data vector as By construction the MIMO converter produces a digital strea m whose pulse-density contains only non-redundant information. To achieve compression some of the digital channels can be discarded signal can be reconstructed from the compressed digital str eam by applying an inverse transforma-tion A  X  1 as An advantage of using a lower triangular form for the linear t ransformation matrix A with its diag-ever, analogous to many naturally occurring signal the unde rlying statistics of multi-dimensional signal changes slowly as the signal itself. Therefore the tr ansmission of the matrix A needs to be performed at a relatively slower rate than the transmission of the compressed neural signals. Similar to conventional  X  X  conversion [9], the framework for MIMO  X  X  can be extended to time-varying input vector under the assumption of high oversampl ing criterion [9]. For a MIMO A/D converter oversampling ratio (OSR) is defined by the ratio of the update frequency f imum Nyquist rate amongst all elements of the input vector x [ n ] . The resolution of the MIMO put signal vector can be assumed to be approximately station ary. For time-varying input vector Figure 3: Functional verification of MIMO  X  X  converter on artificially generated multi-channel produced by MIMO converter steps as Thus if the norm of the matrix A is bounded, then asymptotically N  X   X  the equation 13 imply that the cross-channel correlation between the digital out put and the sign of the input signal ap-proaches zero. This is similar to formulations in ICA where h igher-order de-correlation is achieved using non-linear functions of random variables [12].
 The architecture for the MIMO  X  X  converter illustrating recursions (4) and (11) is shown in F igure represents the output of the  X  X  integrator. All the adaptation and linear transformation s teps can digital-to-analog converters or floating gates synapses. E ven though any channel can be chosen as a reference channel, our experiments indicate that the chan nel with maximum cross-correlation and maximum signal power serves as the best choice.

The multi-channel data was presented to a MIMO sigma delta co nverter implemented in software. The equivalent analog representation of the pulse density e ncoded digital stream was obtained using a moving window averaging technique with window size equal t o the oversampling ratio (OSR). The resultant analog representation of the ADC output is sho wn in 3(b). It can be seen in the the fundamental sinusoids, where as the rest of the digital s treams converged to an equivalent zero output. This simple experiment demonstrates the functiona lity of MIMO sigma-delta in eliminat-ing cross-channel redundancy. The first two digital streams were used to reconstruct the original recording using equation 12. Figure 4 shows the reconstruct ion error averaged over a time window of 2048 samples showing that the error indeed converges to ze ro, as the MIMO converter adapts. The Figure 4 also shows the error curves for different OSR. It can be seen that even though better reconstruction error can be achieved by using higher OSR, th e adaptation procedure compensates for errors introduced due to low resolution. In fact the reco nstruction performance is optimal for intermediate OSR.

 Figure 7: Demonstration of common-mode rejection performe d by MIMO  X  X  : (a) Original multi-The last set of experiments demonstrate the ability of the pr oposed MIMO converter to reject com-mon mode disturbance across all the channels. Rejection of c ommon-mode signal is one of the most important requirement for processing neural signals whose amplitude range from 50  X V -500  X V , where as the common-mode interference resulting from EMG or electrical coupling could be as high as 10 mV [14]. Therefore most of the micro-electrode arrays use bio-potential amplifiers for enhanc-ing signal-to-noise ratio and common-mode rejection. For t his set of experiments, the recorded neu-ral data obtained from the previous experiment was contamin ated by an additive 60Hz sinusoidal interference of amplitude 1 mV . The results are shown in Figure 7 illustrating that the refe rence channel absorbs all the common-mode disturbance where as th e neural information is preserved in other channels. In fact theoretically it can be shown that th e common-mode rejection ratio for the proposed MIMO ADC is dependent only on the OSR and is given by 20 log In this paper we presented a novel MIMO analog-to-digital co nversion algorithm with application to principles, where the data converter maximizes the relativ e distance between signal space corre-sponding to different channels.
