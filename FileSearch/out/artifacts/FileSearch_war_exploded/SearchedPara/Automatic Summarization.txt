 so it X  X  possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that me003 but there is some technology you could try to apply me010 yeah me010 now I don X  X  know that any of these actually apply i n this case me010 uh so if you co-you could ima-and i-me010 mmm me003 there X  X e ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your bayes-net-edness me010 and me010 uh i-i slipped a paper to bhaskara and about noisy-or X  X  and noisy-maxes which is there are technical ways of doing it me010 uh let me just mention something that i don X  X  want to pursue today me010 there there are a variety of ways of doing it me010 discriminative training.
