 There have been many works aiming to retrieve news video contents. However, not much has been reported on what can be done and what can be acquired from a very large news video archive. In other words, most of the works aimed at analyzing and/or retrieving the contents in an archive either from individual units (shots, stories, and so on), or simply within each independent program. quantities. We have built an automati c broadcast video archiving system [Katayama et al. 2004], which has up to now, archived approximately 700 hours of daily Japanese news video spanning over the past four years. Even without such a system, large scale news video archives have become available, for exam-ple by participating to the TREC-Video workshop [NIST]. This has encouraged some groups to start exploring a news video archive according to its contents as a whole, in the aspect of  X  X uestion and Answering X  [Yang et al. 2003],  X  X opic threading X  [Ide et al. 2004, Duygulu et al. 2004], and so on.
 provides access to an archive based on human relations extracted from the archive itself. This approach is proposed since human activity is the core contents in news videos, and that interactions between the humans cause such activities. Therefore, we consider that extracting human relations from a news video archive is an essential foundation for the understanding of its contents. 2.1 Overview Extracting human relations from a large quantity of data has been a hot topic in the data mining, the semantic web, and the social network analysis fields [Kautz et al. 1997]. Works in these fields have focused mainly on e-mail cor-respondence [Golbeck et al. 2004], web links [Matsuo et al. 2005], references in academic papers [Yoshikane et al. 2004], and so on. However extraction of social networks from multimedia data has not been sought.
 in order to realize a retrieval and browsing interface based on the relations. As this enables a user to track down news stories according to human relations, the interface is named trackThem . It is generally considered that the so-called  X 5W1H X  ( i.e. When, Where, Who, What, Why, and How) are essential compo-nents of a news text in journalism, where  X 4W X  ( i.e. When,Where,Who,and What) are especially important entities to describe a story. Most previous works in news video retrieval field retrieve similar stories based on what has happened ( X  X hat X ), some new works consider the time order ( X  X hen X ) as an important fac-tor [Ide et al. 2004, Duygulu et al. 2004], and some other work provides an abil-ity to retrieve/browse by geographical location ( X  X here X ) [Christel et al. 2000]. According to this classification, our proposal can be considered as a method based on  X  X ho X , which has not been sought deeply in previous works. extraction. The overall flow of the process is shown in Fig. 1. 2.2 Detecting Noun Phrases with a Human Attribute Since news videos not only talk about famous people, but they also refer to nameless people, we would like to detect noun phrases that indicate persons (hereinafter personal nouns), including but not limited to names with proper nouns, as in named entity analysis.
 phrase. Based on this nature, we have collected nouns that may represent humans either individually or as a suffix of a noun phrase.
 audio speech provided from the broadcaster) is analyzed by a Japanese morpho-logical analyzer. 1 Next, noun phrases are extracted according to the morphemes, followed by semantic attribute analysis based on the collected nouns. in [Ide et al. 1999]. According to evaluations applied to 2,549 super-imposed captions that appeared in news videos, a precision of 72.47% and a recall of 82.13% were achieved by this method. 2.3 Topic Segmentation Topic segmentation is a major research topic in the text retrieval and the natural language processing fields. The aim of our work is not to compete with the existing works, so we applied a relatively simple method for the segmentation. caption text: 1. Create keyword vectors for each sentence. Keyword vectors for four semantic 2. For each sentence boundary, concatenate w adjacent vectors on both sides 3. Combine the similarities in each semantic attribute and detect a topic bound-4. Concatenate over-segmented topics by measuring the similarity of the key-evaluations applied to 384 manually annotated topic boundaries as a ground-truth, a precision of 90.5% and a recall of 95.4% were achieved by this method when we allowed mis-judgments at a maximum of  X  1 sentence. 2.4 Extracting Human Relations We consider that persons that co-occur within a topic have some kind of relation. The relation R ( p i ,p j ) between two persons p i and p j is defined as follows: where t represents a topic, and f ( p, t ) the frequency of personal noun p in topic t .
 a sentence, and gradually release the weights according to their distance within a topic. However this is left for future investigation. Grouping of the same person with different representation is another issue needed to be solved. However, the solution to this issue may not be trivi al since some representations may be ambiguous and change along time. Currently, the process in Sect. 2 is running fully automatically every night after the broadcast of the program. As of June 5, 2005, we have 17,468 topics ranging over 1,454 days. Within these topics, there were 150,238 noun phrases with a human attribute, of which 15,686 were different. There were 307,951 edges, or human relations, between the 15,686 noun phrases.
 strong bilateral edges (relations) between the nodes (persons) and also strong unilateral nodes that link only the nodes that appeared in the bilateral structure. This structure was extracted automatically by referring to the top ten edges from each node, except for the merger of different representations of the same person. an interface that enables a user to retrieve and view news topics related to a selected pair of persons, while at the same time, track down the human relations. A snapshot of the interface, namely the trackThem interface, is shown in Fig. 3. We believe that this should provide a better understanding of news topics from the view point of human relations. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for news video retrieval; retrieval and browsing according to human relations within a very large-scale archive. Future work includes the evaluation on the extracted relations and the efficacy of the interface. We are also considering to make use of co-occurrences of faces in the image, in order to extract relations that do not appear in the text.
