 Social tagging systems which allow users to create, edit and share collections of internet resources associated with tags in a collabora-tive fashion are growing in popularity in recent years. The rapidly growing amount of shared data in these folksonomies , i.e., tax-onomies created by the folk, presents new technical challenges in-volved with discovering resources which are likely of interest to the user. Social tags which reflect the meaning of resources from the user X  X  points of view provide an opportunity to enhance the quality of retrieval. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to search relevant resources to the user query by incorporating in-formation obtained from folksonomies X  underlying data structures tional retrieval and recommendation techniques which represent a collection by a matrix, we represent our data as a third-order tensor on which a novel Cube Latent Semantic Indexing (CubeLSI) tech-nique is proposed to capture latent semantic associations between tags. With the latent semantic representation we show how to rank relevant resources according to their relevance to user queries. The excellent performance of the method is demonstrated by an exper-imental evaluation on the deli.cio.us dataset.

With the rapid development of Web 2.0 technology, social tag-ging systems, such as Flickr 1 , del.icio.us 2 , Last.fm 3 are emerging to help users share their internet resources with tags. A tag is a term that provides a piece of textual information that is related to an annotated resource. For example, Flickr is a popular photo-sharing website which allows users to upload, manage and share their favorite photos. One of the key features of Flickr is tags with which users describe the content of photos, the brands of cam-eras making the photos, the date of taking the photos and so forth. These tags allow users to explicitly express their interests to the photos and facilitate users to retrieve the photos again by brows-ing and searching. del.icio.us is a social bookmarking system in which users can save, organize and share web pages. Unlike tra-ditional bookmarking systems which use folders to organize book-marks, del.icio.us provides a tagging tool to help users organize their bookmarks more e ff ectively. Tags are not only used to de-scribe, manage, and retrieve bookmarks but also serve to aid users to find interesting new bookmarks.

Social tagging advocates a natural way to form a so-called folk-sonomy , a portmanteau of the words folk and taxonomy , for col-laboratively generating tags to annotate and to categorize internet resources. What is considered as a resource relies on the nature of the system. For Flickr the resources are photos, and for Youtube the resources are videos. Tags can provide precise descriptions of content items, flavored with the respective personal interest of the user who generates the tag.

Folksonomies benefit from the fact that no specific skills are needed to narrow the semantic gap between various types of re-sources and users X  personal perspectives as well as interests to these resources. Since it is proven to be intuitive to adopt, an increasing number of users have been taking part in social tagging systems and have contributed a great amount of resources. As these systems are growing, the rapidly increasing amount of shared data presents new technical challenges to the discovery of resources that match users X  interests. There are several critical issues that potentially impair the quality of search results. The first one is tag synonymy where dif-ferent tags bear similar meanings. Tag synonymy leads to degrada-tion in search recall in that the system may fail to discover a relevant resource without the tags which appear in the query. For example, a search for  X  X ar X  raised by a specific user who intends to find car-related photos may not obtain a photo with the tag  X  X utomobile X , even though these two tags have the same meaning. Apart from tag synonymy, tag polysemy, which means a single tag has mul-http: // www.flickr.com http: // del.icio.us http: // www.last.fm http: // www.youtube.com Table 1: Examples of records in del.icio.us bookmarking system
User ID Tag Bookmark URL tiple meanings, leads to degradation in search precision because it is likely to result in mismatch between the given query and re-sources which are in fact irrelevant. For instance, an entomologist and a software engineer looking for the tag  X  X ug X  probably desire di ff erent sets of resources. Both tag synonymy and tag polysemy result from the user-generated tags informally chosen from an un-controlled vocabulary, which likely a ff ects the retrieval of resources [9]. Additionally, the query ambiguity is aggravated by the fact that typical user queries are rarely more than a few tags in length and thus likely represent many potential information needs.

To remedy all of the above problems, unlike traditional infor-mation retrieval systems, we advocate leveraging the  X  X isdom of crowds X  by investigating the folksonomy X  X  underlying data struc-ture consisting of a set of user / tag / resource triplets to enhance the quality of search results in social tagging systems. As shown in Ta-ble 1 which presents several exemplary records in del.icio.us book-marking system, each line represents a record that a user ( u ) anno-Thus each record can be represented by a triple ( u , t , r ).
This paper presents a framework to search relevant resources to a given query by incorporating information obtained from folk-sonomies X  underlying data structures. By extending the matrix rep-resenting a collection for traditional retrieval and recommendation techniques, we represent our data structure as a third-order tensor on which a novel Cube Latent Semantic Indexing (CubeLSI) tech-nique is proposed to capture latent semantic associations between tags, such that the correlations between users, tags and resources can be captured simultaneously. With the latent semantic repre-sentation, we apply hierarchical agglomerative clustering to learn a latent concept space in which tags corresponding to the same latent concept are grouped together. With this latent concept space, bag-of-concepts model, an extension of bag-of-words model, is used for ranking relevant resources in collection according to their relevance to the user query. It is worth noting that our approach is feasible for social tagging systems with various types of data sources (e.g. photos and videos), since it is independent of any inherent feature of the resource itself.
A folksonomy can be represented by a tuple F B ( U , T , R , Y ) where U , T and R are the set of users, tags and resources respec-tively and Y is a ternary relation between them, i.e., Y  X  U  X  T  X  R . We use u , t and r to denote the elements of U , T and R , respectively. source r . Di ff erent from traditional search systems which ignore the "users" dimension, our CubeLSI technique adopts a third-order tensor A X  R | U | X | T | X | R | of boolean values to represent the underlying data structure of a folksonomy F .

A tensor is a multidimensional array which extends the notion of scalar, vector, and matrix. The value of the element ( u , t , r ) of our third-order tensor A is determined by,
The matrix unfoldings operation is the process of reordering the elements of a tensor into matrices. By performing  X  X atrix un-A the unfolding procedures. Intuitively, we can see that the matrix A 1 is formed by cutting the tensor A along the second mode into several  X  X atrix slices X  and listing these matrices one after another.

CubeLSI initially employs a third-order tensor A to reveal the underlying data structure of a folksonomy. Then latent semantic analysis is conducted on tensor A to obtain its approximation by which pairwise distances between tags are computed in Step 3. Algorithm 1 provides the details on how CubeLSI is applied on tensors and how pairwise distances between tags are calculated based on the approximated tensor.
With the pairwise distances computed between tags based on the latent semantic representation, hierarchical agglomerative cluster-ing is performed to learn a latent concept space for tags. The dis-covered tag clusters, each of which is regarded as a latent concept, form the basis of our ranking model.

In traditional information retrieval, the bag-of-words assumption is widely used. Here, we use a similar idea for resource represen-tation over a set of latent concepts, referred as to bag-of-concepts. Each resource r is modeled as a vector r = ( w ( l 1 , r ) , w ( l w ( l | L | , r )) over the set of latent concepts where each weight w ( l in each dimension corresponds to the importance of a particular la-tent concept l i to a resource. Similarly, the given query containing a set of tags can also be modeled as a weighted vector over the set of latent concepts. To calculate the vector weights, we employ the t f -id f weighting scheme due to its simplicity and e ff ectiveness. Then, we sort the resources in the collection in descending order based on the Cosine similarity score calculated between the given query and each resource. The Cosine similarity is defined as:
We now describe briefly each of the algorithms for our evalua-tion.

Freq. A direct and straightforward search scheme is to calculate the similarity based on the count of use frequency of shared terms between the query and tag set of each resource, which has been widely applied in current social tagging systems. In a folksonomy the the set of users who annotate resource r with tag t , equation (8) shows the similarity measure between query q and resource r . Note that S im freq ( q , r ) is defined as 0 when tags ( r ) is empty.
FolkRank. The PageRank algorithm [2] reflects the idea that a web page is important if there are many pages linking to it, and if those pages are important themselves. The same principle was employed for folksonomies in [3]: a resource which is tagged with important tags by important users becomes important itself. The same holds, symmetrically, for tags and users. By modifying the weights for a given tag in the random surfer vector, FolkRank can compute a ranked list of relevant resources.

LSI. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a typical indexing and retrieval method that identifies patterns in the relationships between the terms and concepts contained in an unstructured collection of text by performing SVD on the weighted term-document matrix. We employ the same principle for folksonomies by constructing the weighted tag-resource matrix, each element of which is assigned a weight based on the t f -id f weighting scheme.

CubeSim. CubeSim adopts a third-order tensor A X  R | U | X | T | X | R | of boolean values to represent the underlying data structure of a folksonomy ( U , T , R , Y ). Normally the tensor A is sparse. We de-fine the distance between tag t i and t j as: Dist( t i , t A matrices). Each element of A : , t i , : is assigned 1 if user u annotates resource r with tag t i , 0 otherwise. || X || F denotes Frobenius-norm.
There are many social tagging systems on the Web. For our ex-periment, we use a data collection crawled from del.icio.us, a social bookmarking system, during December 2008. In total, our data set consists of 3,398,402 bookmarking records having 326,526 unique user IDs, 171,584 unique tags, and 56,452 unique URLs.

This data set is raw data and very sparse. To reduce the noise, we first clean this data set by removing those records with system-generated tags, such as  X  X ystem:imported X  and  X  X ublic X . All tags are converted to be lowercase. Then, we follow a similar approach applied in [5] to get denser data. We adapt the notion of a p -core [1] at level k = 30 to the constructed tripartite hypergraph and obtain 726,164 bookmarking records, 10,119 unique users, 1,809 unique tags and 3,340 unique URLs.
We evaluate the ranking algorithms by computing normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) [4]. NDCG is a retrieval mea-sure devised specifically for search evaluation. It is well suited to search evaluation as it rewards relevant objects that are top-ranked more heavily than those ranked lower. Figure 3 shows the comparison of five ranking algorithms, i.e., CubeLSI, CubeSim, LSI, FolkRank and Freq. We can observe that using CubeSim together with the bag-of-concepts model to utilize social wisdom does improve the performance of resource discovery. By perform-ing CubeLSI on the third-order tensor to learn the latent seman-tic representation for each tag, the performance can be further im-proved.
In this paper, we studied the novel problem of collaborative re-source discovery in social tagging systems. We have developed a framework to search relevant resources to the user query by incor-porating information obtained from folksonomies X  underlying data structures which consist of a set of user / tag / resource triples. To capture the latent semantic associations between tags, we proposed a novel CubeLSI technique based on a third-order tensor. Then, hi-erarchical agglomerative clustering was employed to learn a latent concept space. With this latent concept space, the bag-of-concepts model was used to not only discover relevant resources, but also rank the search results.

Encouraging results are reported. It is worth noting that although we have only used del.icio.us data for the experiment, the proposed method is a general approach and can be applied for other data sources. We believe this work can provide new facilities and op-portunities for social tagging services. [1] V. Batagelj and M. Zaversnik. Generalized cores. CoRR , [2] S. Brin and L. Page.
