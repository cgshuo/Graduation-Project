 dimensionality of gene expression data constitutes a challenging analytical problem. on gene expression profiles. For example, unsupervised methods such as clustering [1] and self-organizing maps [2] and supervised methods such as artificial neural networks role in the problem of tumor classification without doubt. dataset. For example, Xuewu Zhang et al [7] applied independent component analysis (ICA) to extract independent components (ICs) from gene expression data to be used as classification information. Wang X.H. et al [8] use stationary wavelet transform to propose a novel feature extraction method which combines gene ranking and wavelet package decomposition (WPD) to extract tumor-related features which are used as the input of SVM classifier. 2.1 Representation of Gene Expression Profiles gene expression profiles can be represented as matrix where
The matrix X is composed of m row vectors n data. The expression levels of two samples selected randomly in leukemia dataset are shown in Fig. 1 in which one is an ALL sample and another is an AML sample. 2.2 The Algorithm Model problem. To achieve this goal, the framework of classification algorithm is designed introduced in the following sections. Step 1. Gene selection: for each gene top-ranked genes with the highest scores as the selected gene subset Step 2. Applying three-layer WPD to the top-ranked gene subset to extract its eigenvectors. classification. accuracy of tumor classification. 2.3 Gene Selection (Step 1) expression profiles. In measuring the classification information of genes, Golub et al [9] proposed FSC as gene selection method. For each gene correspond to the gene its score with the FSC formula () ( )/( ) score values. However, when the mean values of gene are equal, there is a fault in this formula because this gene from informative gene subset due to 0 ) ( = proposed [10]. RFSC consists of two parts. The first part is the original FSC formula, and the second part concerns the classification performance of variance. 2.4 Wavelet Package Decomposition (Step 2) [11] frequency. Therefore, it is the more precise method than wavelet decomposition. As it extraction of a sample is described as follows. Step 2.1. Sample viewed as signal is decomposed into three-layer wavelet package to signals of various frequency scopes. signal S can be expressed as follows: constructing eigenvectors for each sample. Let 2.5 Support Vector Machines (Step 3) [12] Vapnik. SVM builds up a hyper-plane as the decision surface to maximize the margin of sample eigenvector equivalent to finding all the support vectors 3.1 The Descriptions of Two Tumor Datasets the colon dataset [13]. The descriptions of the two datasets are shown in Table 1. 3.2 Experiment Methods data using WPD is implemented in MATLAB 7.1, and the corresponding source code is shown in Fig. 3. 
We firstly apply FSC and RFSC to roughly select the top-ranked gene subset, extract eigenvectors which are used as the input of the SVM software LIBSVM [14] also used in our experiments. However, finding the best combination for the SVM classifier. 3.3 Experiment Results different gene selection methods. Experiments show that FSC is better than RFSC to the leukemia dataset in our classification method and in contrast RFSC is better than FSC to the colon dataset, which is obviously validated in Fig. 4. Table 2 partly shows the classification accuracy for the leukemia and colon datasets using different wavelet RFSC to the colon dataset, respectively. It is obvious that the classification accuracy relatively suitable for the two datasets simultaneously. 
The 4-fold CV accuracy of 94.44% can be achieved when extracting eigenvectors correspondingly 82.26% for raw colon samples. Why the CV accuracy is not enough classification when using wavelet db9 from 20 to 400 top-ranked genes. From Fig. 4 for the colon dataset. 3.4 Comparison of the Classification Accuracy Many feature extraction and machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to the tumor classification based on gene expression data. Comparison of the classification accuracy among different tumor classification approaches are shown in Table 3 from which we can conclude that our approach obtains almost the best results and the validity of our approach is also evaluated. In fact, among the published tumor datasets, classifying the colon dataset is more difficulty than doing others. A novel feature extraction method to extract eigenvectors from high dimensional gene expression profiles using three-layer WPD is proposed, which deal with gene well-known tumor datasets are examined to assess the classification performance, and the experiment results show that the 4-fold CV accuracy of 100% is obtained for the sample from patient can be extracted independently.
