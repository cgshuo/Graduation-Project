 One of the strong points of E-commerce websites is that they are often abundant with product reviews from consumers who experienced the products and testify to the usefulness of the products or otherwise. These reviews are helpful for consumers to optimize their purchasing decisions. However, while popular products receive many reviews, many other products do not have an adequate number of reviews lead-ing to the cold item problem. In this proposal, we propose a solution outline for the cold item problem by automati-cally generating reviews and predicting ratings for the cold products from available reviews of similar products in e-commerce websites as well as users X  opinion shared in the microblogging platforms such as Twitter. We propose a framework to build a formal semantic representation of prod-ucts from unstructured product descriptions, user reviews as well as user ratings. Such presentations assist us to mea-sure product similarity and relatedness in a accurate and cost-effective way. Besides, we propose a model to generate additional reviews for a cold product by mining users X  posts shared on medium such as Twitter and transfer them to the e-commerce website. Preliminary experiments show promis-ing results in finding products similar to the cold products.
With the growing popularity of online services, many com-mercial websites have provided user feedback section as one of their most important services which allows users to ex-press their opinions about products and services and rate them. On the one hand, users X  opinions can help others to make an informed purchase decision, and on the other hand, they help providers to improve the quality of their services and products. Recommender systems can also benefit from users opinions to improve their recommendations through collaborative filtering .

However, various studies have shown that in commercial websites such as Amazon.com and Epinions.com, there are not adequate number of reviews and ratings for different products: more than 90% of products have less than 10 re-views, leading to so-called cold items problem [7]. The prob-lem of data sparsity and cold start is particularly challenging in recommender systems as recommendation performance in a cold start situation degrades dramatically.

There are various earlier works that address the prob-lem of cold start and cold item in recommender systems [3, 7, 8, 10]. Some works use content information to bridge the gap between existing and new items by inferring simi-larities among them and combine them with collaborative algorithms in various ways [1, 10]. Some works exploit ad-ditional external taxonomies or ontologies [2, 3]. The main issue of these works is that they rely on an external ontol-ogy which is non-generalizable and hard to scale. There are other works that don X  X  need the taxonomy but work with product category information that is inherently structured [1, 8]. The problem with this approach is it will limit the extraction of information to one or potentially few websites. In this proposal, we go beyond these approaches and mine information about a product from anywhere on the Web, specifically microblogging platforms and any unstructured description about products. We aim to propose a frame-work to address cold item problem by finding a unique rep-resentation of items using description texts of products and exploiting this representation to find further information on microblogging platforms which are rich in information.Our main contributions can be enumerated as follows: 1-As a first step of our work, we propose a technique to extract product representations. We are interested in find-ing a suitable formal representation of products that can be mined from unstructured product descriptions, user reviews as well as user ratings. Such representation would need to enable us to measure product similarity and relatedness in an accurate and cost-efficient way. We are interested in ex-ploring methods proposed in Word Embedding literature [5, 9] for producing vector representation for e-commerce prod-ucts. 2-Given the formal vector representation of products, we will explore a review selection model to select ratings and reviews of non-cold products with similar vector representa-tion to the cold start product; and then transfer a subset of them as a potential review for the cold product. Note that, selected reviews should satisfy different metrics, which will be discussed in Section 3. 3-To collect more reviews for cold products, we aim to ex-ploit some auxiliary and rich sources such as microblogging platforms (e.g., Twitter), in order to find users feedback re-lated to the cold start product. We then generate reviews from users X  feedback; predict users X  ratings and finally trans-fer them to e-commerce website.
In recent years, common approaches to mitigate the cold start problem rely on exploiting external contents in addi-tion to users ratings and combine them with collaborative filtering approaches. Examples of external content include item taxonomies, product categories and external knowledge bases which are adopted by several researchers [2, 3].
Leung et.al [3] integrate item taxonomy information within the collaborative filtering model. To do so, they proposed Cross-Level Association RulEs (CLARE) based on item tax-onomies to infer rating for the cold start item. However, since building item taxonomies for different types of prod-uct is not a trivial-task, this approach might not be easily scalable for different domains.

Barjasteh et al. [1] propose a matrix factorization ap-proach which constructs a similarity matrix based on struc-tured contents of items available on different websites. First, they filter out cold items from the original matrix and then fill in the missing values of the non-cold items. Afterwards, they transduct the information from non-cold items to cold items by applying spectral clustering on similarity matrix. However, the functionality of this approach depends on prod-ucts X  structured information which limits the extraction of product information to few websites.

Park et al. [8] propose to retrieve relevant opinion sen-tences from the reviews of other products using specifica-tions of a new product. Their key idea is that opinions on similar products may be applicable to the product that lacks reviews. They computed similarity between products based on the structured product specifications which are available in the some review websites. They further introduce a prob-abilistic approach to generate a set of review sentences from similar product for the cold start product. However, this approach can only perform on the structured content and is not applicable on unstructured description of products, which limit its capability in product modeling and presen-tation.
 Our proposed work borrow from the same principals as Park et al. but does not limit itself to structured product specifications. In our research, we propose an approach to address the limitations of existing works in dealing with the cold item problem. Our approach is generalizable in that it does not rely on any external structured information such as product taxonomies or ontologies. Rather, we propose to mine product information from unstructured data anywhere on the Web and create a formal representation for products. We further exploit microblogging platforms such as Twit-ter to identify users X  feedback about the cold product to be transferred onto the e-commerce website.
In this section, we present our proposed framework for ad-dressing cold item problem. Our framework consists of three components: 1) Product representation model and the asso-ciated method for extracting it, which will produce domain-independent representation of products; 2) Review selection model to find suitable reviews from similar products to be assigned to the cold product; and 3) Review transferring ap-proach to enrich the reviews of cold products by exploiting auxiliary information from source such as Twitter.
In the following, we describe each component of our frame-work in more details.
The idea of producing product representations for the pur-pose of product similarity, clustering and recommendation has already been widely explored in the literature [8]. There have also been approaches that build product representa-tions to address the cold start problem [1]. However, the majority, if not all, of these approaches build the product representation from structured specifications provided by e-commerce websites. For instance product categories, tags, and property/values are used for generating the product rep-resentation; therefore, limiting their applicability to the ap-plicability of the extracted representation to the source from which the representation was extracted.

We are interested in learning product representations that can be transferable across multiple domains. To this end, we will consider Word Embedding techniques in our work. Word Embedding techniques have been applied by some re-searchers for the purpose of semantic text annotation, con-tent disambiguation and entity linking. The work in [13] ap-plies the Skipgram model [5] to produce continuous real val-ued vectors for each word from entity name (surface words) and takes an average of the vectors to represent the entity. We propose that the same strategy that has been used for entity and concept representation can be extended for learn-ing product representations. However, we argue that build-ing vectors based on the surface words is limiting, as the meaning of the composing words can be different from the meaning of the entity as a whole. Our proposed approach in product representation addresses these limitations.
The basic idea of our proposed work for SPR is to extract products descriptive contents available on the Web, which are mainly unstructured, and semantically represent them based on the Word Embedding approaches. In SPR, we will consider an unstructured text about the product, e.g., the description of a product in the website, review texts of the product, wikipedia pages, among other, as an input and ex-ploit Word Embedding methods such as Skipgram, CBOW, [5] and GloVe [9] to represent the product as vector of fea-tures. The reason that we are interested in Word Embed-dings is that they are distributional representations of words which give collective meaning to the words which are used in similar contexts. So, by exploiting this technique and using descriptive contents available on the Web, we can poten-tially bring products into a semantic representation space which preserve distance and geometric properties, which is desirable for the sake of review transfer in the later stages of our work. This representation of products opens up many possibilities such as product mention identification, product similarity calculation, product categorization and clustering, just to name a few.
 We formalize the product representation model as follows:
Given a product p and its associate descriptive text, we first pre-process the text to remove stopwords and also stem the words. We then replace any mentions of the target prod-uct with a unique token, rather than treating it as just union of words. The reason for this action is that the meanings of the exact words are different from the meaning of the product as a whole. For example, we cannot reach a proper representation for product  X  X pple iPhone 6s Plus X  by sim-ply composing the meanings of { Apple, iPhone, 6s, Plus } . Alternatively, we should consider all these words as one to-ken e.g., { Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus } , and then represents it as a vector. Now we introduce interleave function: Where t is a text, w is a word, k is a constant integer, and t [1 ..k ] denotes the substring of t containing the first k words of t . The operator + here represents the strings concatenation operation. we obtain final text t 0 as follows: Where t is the descriptive text, ut represents a unique to-ken for p , and ilf is an interleaving factor that defines the distance between two product tokens in the final text. The goal of interleaving is to place ut in every ilf words of t . We interleave to make sure that all relevant words for a product are placed in a visible context for the Word Embedding tech-nique. Given numerous Word Embedding techniques [5, 9] in the literature, we apply different Word Embedding method such as Skipgram and GloVe on t 0 to produce a model that contains feature vectors for each word in t 0 . Where model contains the set of all word vectors in the t 0 . The generated vector of the p is presented as: v is the vector in the model which corresponds to ut .
Park et al. [8] have already argued that an effective ap-proach for fixing the cold item problem is to transfer ratings and reviews from similar products. We adopt a similar strat-egy and are interested in identifying transferable reviews and ratings from similar products. Unlike the work by Park et al. that identifies similar products based on structured product information, we will use our own SPR model to mine product specifications. We will use various vector sim-ilarity measurement techniques to identify similar products. The reviews and ratings of warm products that are highly similar to the cold products can then be transferred to the cold products. However, the review selection mechanism is a non-trivial task and there are several issues that need to be properly addressed: 1) the number of selected reviews: finding an optimal number of reviews that would be trans-ferred is challenging. On the one hand, a small number of reviews would contain only a limited set of information and would not be able to address the cold products problem. On the other hand, a large set of reviews could potentially carry irrelevant information and may confuse users. We are interested in applying the work in microblog summariza-tion techniques [12] for determining an optimal number of reviews or ratings that would be transferred 2) review cov-erage: it is most probable that reviews only cover one or few aspects of the product. We need to identify major aspects of the products and then select those covering reviews that ad-dress the majority of them. This would need to be addressed in concert with the problem of identifying the number of re-views. We will consider the literature on mining product review aspects [6] for the purpose of determining the most important aspects of a product that have been mentioned in reviews or social microblogging platforms 3) review central-ity: It is important that the selected reviews should reflect the central opinion of users [8]. That is, the selected reviews should include the orientation distribution of users X  reviews. For example, if there are more reviews that contains a  X  X oor screen display X  than a value  X  X igh quality display X  for a cer-tain feature, it is more desired to select those review with a higher observation frequency.
In the third step of our work, we intend to enrich the products reviews by collecting more information about them from some auxiliary and rich sources. For our purpose, we choose Twitter, one of the most popular microblogging plat-forms, which allows users to freely share their feelings and opinions in a real-time manner. We propose a review trans-ferring approach to retrieve those tweets that express users feedback about cold product, and then transfer them to the e-commerce website. There are already work that perform sentiment mining for certain brands or products from mi-croblogging platforms [11], but to the extent of our knowl-edge, none have considered the idea of generating reviews and transferring them for the cold item problem. Our pro-posed model consists of three steps: 1) tweet selection : Our objective is to find a representation that would be able to detect Related Products (RP) that are not necessarily the exact product that we are looking for but have sufficiently similar characteristics for their reviews and comments to be transferable to the product of interest. 2) rating prediction from tweets : Since in Twitter users share their feeling and opinion about products, we employ sentiment analysis techniques on RP X  X  tweets. The overall rating of the tweets would be transferred to the e-commerce website in the form of summarized ranking for the cold item. 3) review generation : A subset of RP X  X  tweets which are compliant with the characteristics described earlier such as review centrality, coverage and size are selected and consid-ered to be used for generating reviews. Our hypothesis will be that tweets about products could potentially be viewed as product reviews that have been posted on Twitter as op-posed to an e-commerce website. We will summarize the set of tweets to serve as the generated reviews for a cold product and would be transferred to the e-commerce web-site. It is important to note that, selecting tweets relevant to specific products is non-trivial for two reasons: 1) struc-tured descriptive content that are available for products are not necessarily present in the microblog posts; and 2) en-tity linking techniques identify the mention of a device but not its brand, make and other details; therefore, making it harder to identify close matches. Our SPR model that relies on Word Embedding techniques can help in this respect as such techniques have already been used for entity linking on Twitter [14].
In order to evaluate our proposed approach, we need to first collect a dataset of real-world users reviews and ratings associated with products which is available in e-commerce websites such as Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, and CNET.com. Among them, we chose CNET.com because it has reason-able number of products and review information and rela-tively large descriptions. We have crawled CNET.com and extracted related information about products such as their descriptive content, their associated reviews and ratings as well as the users X  information.
The goal of the proposed approach is to generate reviews and predict their associated ratings for the cold products. We plan to incorporate different Word Embedding tech-niques such as Glove, Skipgram and LDA in SPR; and choose the one which yields the best possible results in review gen-eration and rating prediction.

For evaluating the performance of the review generation approach, using standard retrieval measures do not seem ap-propriate. Instead, we select a set of non-cold products and we apply our review generation approach on such products. Then we measure the proximity between the generated re-views and their actual reviews. Since the generated reviews can be considered as summarization task, as indicated in [8] we then employ summarization evaluation methods such as ROUGE [4], which is a standard evaluation system for multiple document summarization, and evaluate the quality of an automatically generated reviews by comparing them with the actual reviews of non-cold products. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of rating prediction approach, the common approach is to measure how much the predicted ratings are close to the actual ratings. Metrics such as MSE, RMSE and MAE would be adopted for this purpose.
As a preliminary step for our work, we crawled the phone category in CNET.com website which contains 4,848 phone products, 6,215 reviews; and ratings within a range of [0,5] from 867 users. We extracted the description of products that are available on the website as the input for SPR, de-scribed in Section 3.1. We then experimented three different interleaving factors: 1, 5, 20 and used Skipgram and GloVe methods to make the model with window size of 5 and vec-tor dimension of 200. We applied K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm on feature vectors of products. We then evaluate rating prediction error of the model using RMSE metric. Experimental results are shown in Table 1 and indicate that the prediction error of KNN based on PRS model is mini-mum when ilf = 1, as well as skipgram outperforms GloVe in rating prediction with similar settings.
In this research, we propose to address cold item prob-lem in e-commerce website. Our approach is generalizable as there is no need for structured information like exter-nal taxonomies or ontologies or structured specifications of products. Our proposed approach enables us to mine infor-mation about products from anywhere on the Web, specifi-cally microblogging platforms and any unstructured descrip-tion about products. Our contributions are three-folds: 1) we introduce an algorithm to build a formal representation of products using unstructured content; 2) we propose a re-view and rating selection model to find similar products and transfer their reviews to the cold start products; and 3) to benefit from the abundance of information on Twitter, we propose mechanisms to analyse those tweets related to a cold product; and then transfer them as reviews to e-commerce websites.
