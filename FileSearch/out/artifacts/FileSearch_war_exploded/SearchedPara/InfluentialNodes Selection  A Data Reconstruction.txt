 Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of seed nodes in social network for maximizing the spread of influence. Traditionally, researchers view influence propa-gation as a stochastic process and formulate the influence maximization problem as a discrete optimization problem. Thus, most previous works focus on finding efficient and effective heuristic algorithms within the greedy framework. In this paper, we view the influence maximization problem from the perspective of data reconstruction and propose a novel framework named Data Reconstruction for In uence Maximization (DRIM). In our framework, we first construct an influence matrix, each row of which is the influence of a n-ode to other nodes. Then, we select k most informative rows to reconstruct the matrix and the corresponding nodes are the seed nodes which could maximize the influence spread. Finally, we evaluate our framework on two real-world data sets, and the results show that DRIM is at least as effective as the traditional greedy algorithm.
 H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Applications X  Data Mining Social Networks, Influence Maximization, Data Reconstruc-tion In recent years, social network sites such as Facebook 1 and Twitter 2 have become very popular and many people com-municate with each other on them.

Thus, the key problem is how to figure out these influential nodes. To this end, Kempe et al. [9] formulate it as a discrete optimization problem known as influence maxi-mization problem. In their paper, two classical propagation models were discussed: Linear Threshold (LT) model [7] and Independent Cascade(IC) model [5]. Furthermore, they proved that influence maximization is an NP-hard problem in both models and proposed a greedy solution. Due to the submodular property of this problem, the greedy algorithm can approximate the optimal solution within a constant fac-tor. Meanwhile, Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the influence spread (i.e., the expected number of nodes that will be influenced) of the node set in the greedy algorithm, as influence propagation is treated as a stochastic process in both LT and IC models.

One of the biggest challenges of the greedy algorithm is that we need to run Monte Carlo simulation sufficient-ly many times (e.g., 10,000) for accurately estimating the influence spread, i.e., very time-consuming. Thus, the fol-lowing researchers mainly focus on reducing the calculation. Leskovec et al. [11] exploited the submodular property and proposed CELF algorithm which is 700 times faster than the greedy algorithm without effectiveness loss. Chen et al. [3] proposed degree discount heuristic algorithm which is much faster than the greedy algorithm but not as effective as it. Along this line, several other heuristic algorithms have been proposed [2, 4, 6, 15]. These algorithms exploit the property of the social network or approximate the influence propaga-tion models for computing the influence spread of a set of nodes faster [1]. In this way, they speed up the algorithm but are usually less effective.

However, we can explore other aspects of the influence maximization problem besides searching for more effective heuristics. That is, we may think about this problem from a different perspective. Actually, influence maximization finds some influential nodes whose influence can cover the whole network, which is similar to selecting some informative rows to reconstruct a matrix. Inspired by [16, 8], in this paper we treat influence maximization as a data reconstruction prob-lem. Specifically, we propose a novel framework called Da-ta Reconstruction for In uence Maximization (DRIM) which finds the influential nodes by minimizing the reconstruction error. In our framework, we first construct an influence ma-trix, each row of which is the influence of a node to other nodes. Then, we try to select k most informative rows to reconstruct the influence matrix and the corresponding n-odes are the seed nodes which could maximize the influence sp read. We verify our framework on two real-world data set-s, and the experimental results show that DRIM is at least as effective as the greedy algorithm. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
In this section, we propose a new framework to solve the influence maximization problem from the perspective of da-ta reconstruction. We first review the definition of influ-ence maximization problem, and then describe the proposed framework in detail.

Let G = ( V; E; T ) represent a social network, where V is the node set and E is the edge set. If there is an edge from node i to node j in E , t i;j in influence propagation matrix T = [ t i;j ] n  X  n is the influence transmission probability from i to j . According to the definition of Kempe et al. [9], influence maximization problem is a discrete optimization problem: given a social network, and a number k , find k nodes, called the seed set, such that by activating them, the expected number of final activated nodes is maximized. Different from traditional methods, we find the influential seed nodes from the perspective of data reconstruction. The proposed framework contains two steps: 1. Construct an influence matrix X  X  R N  X  N , where x i  X  2. Select k most informative rows from the matrix X to There are a few ways to construct the influence matrix. However, in IC and LT model, we have to use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the influence spread which is very time-consuming. Thus we turn to the linear model proposed by Xiang et al. [14]. In their model, we can get a closed-form solution of the influence of a single node or a set of nodes. Specifically, the influence from i to j , f i  X  j , is defined as : where N j = { j 1 ; j 2 ; :::j m } is j  X  X  neighborhood node set, and j are two parameters of the model 3 .

According to the solution given by Xiang et al. [14], we can obtain the influence vector f i = [ f i  X  1 ; f i  X  2 node i by solving the linear system P  X  1 P  X  i = e i , where P = ( I + I  X  T  X  )  X  1 . And f i is exactly the i -th row of the influence matrix X .
Given influence matrix, we can find influential nodes with data reconstruction method. Since each row of the influence
Plea se see [14] for more details matrix is the influence of a node to other nodes, finding informative rows to reconstruct the influence matrix essen-tially means finding influential nodes whose influence can cover the whole network. Specifically, we try to select k most informative rows to reconstruct the influence matrix and the corresponding nodes are the seed nodes. Inspired by [16, 8], we formulate this problem as follows: min s:t: a i;j  X  0 j  X  0 and a i  X  R n i = 1 :::n; j = 1 :::n where A T = [ a 1 ; ::: a n ]. = [ 1 ; :::; n ] T is an auxiliary variable to control nodes selection. We impose l 1 norm [13] on to induce sparsity. If j = 0, the j -th column must be 0 which means the j -th node is not selected.

We X  X  like to give more implication about the nonnegative constraints [10] used in Eq. (1). Since one X  X  influence will not fade with the existence of others, which shares a similar assumption with IC model, the nonnegative constraints used here can make the result more interpretable. That is, it allows only additive, not subtractive, combination of the nodes X  influence vectors.

By fixing a i  X  X  and setting the derivative of J with respect to to be zero, we can obtain the closed-form solution of :
By fixing , the remaining problem can be solved by pro-jected gradient descent. The gradient is :
Thus the update formula is: Algorithm 1 gives the details of the procedure.

We provide validation on two real-world data sets. One of them is the Wikipedia who-votes-on-whom network (Wiki-Vote), and the other one is the collaboration network from DBLP. Specifically, we demonstrate that our framework is at least as effective as the greedy algorithm. Data Sets . The first data set is downloaded from S-NAP 4 . The second data set is downloaded from DBLP 5 . As for the second data set from DBLP, we focus on three re-search domains (i.e., three subnetworks), which are  X  X nfor-mation Retrieval X (IR),  X  X ata Mining X (DM) and  X  X achine Learning X (ML). We select the papers that are published be-fore January 2013 from several top-ranked journals and con-ferences for each domain. The authors of these papers are used as nodes in the collaboration network. When two au-thors have one co-authored paper, an edge will be added between the corresponding nodes.

The propagation probability of an edge ( i; j ) is set to indeg ree ( j ) , as widely used in the literature [9, 3, 6, 15]. In order to make the linear system in Section 2.1 converge, we slightly change the probability by multiplying it with a small real number. For the propagation probability in real world is quite small, we set it as 0.1 in our experiment.
In total, we get four social networks. More detailed infor-mation is shown in Table 1.

Parameter Settings . There are two parameters: and in linear model. When we compute the influence matrix, we set the same value for all nodes. Here, we set the to 1, which means that each node has full confidence of itself and the self-influence is 1. As for , we choose the same value as [14], which is 0.176. In the data reconstruction step, there is a parameter that controls the sparsity of the matrix. We have tried a few values in our experiment and discovered that the algorithm gets its best performance when equals to 0.4.

Baseline Algorithms . We compare the proposed frame-work, referred as DRIM , with three baseline algorithms on the IC model. The baseline algorithms are as follows:
Given the output of each algorithm, we use it as the initial seeds to compute their influence spread on the IC model. In the computation process, we run 10,000 Monte Carlo simu-lations to obtain an estimation of the influence spread. h ttp://snap.stanford.edu http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/
Effectiveness validation . We run tests on four social networks to obtain influence spread results. The seed set size k ranges from 1 to 100, and the parameter is 0.4. Figure 1 shows the influence spread results on the four social networks. The influence spread results in Figure 1 show that DRIM and Greedy obviously outperform the Degree Discount and PageRank . DRIM and Greedy have a similar effectiveness when the seed size k is small. However, when k increases, DRIM has a bit better performance than Greedy . We can discover such a tendency in all four social networks. Actually, Table 2 compares the influence spread results of DRIM and Greedy when k is greater than 80. In Table 2, we use  X + X  and  X - X  to denote the wins and losses of DRIM compared with Greedy respectively. When we pay attention to the nodes these algorithms find, we discover another interesting phenomenon: DRIM and Greedy find the same top 10 influential nodes on Wiki-Vote data set. As for other social networks, most of the influential nodes that DRIM and Greedy find are the same, when k increases from 10 to 100. Finally, Table 3 shows the high number of the same influential nodes found by DRIM and Greedy . This phenomenon demonstrates the effectiveness of DRIM from another angle.

Case Study . We show a case study by illustrating the names of influential seed nodes ( k =10) in DM domain in Ta-ble 4. From Table 4, we can see that the influential authors found by DRIM and Greedy are quite similar. Because of the lack of ground truth, we refer to top authors list in DM domain provided by Microsoft Academic Search 6 . This list ranks the authors in DM domain according to their field rating. The first four authors found by DRIM is exactly the top-4 authors in the list of Microsoft Academic Search. However, the fifth and seventh authors found by DRIM are ranked 147 and 466 in the list of Microsoft Academic Search. The remaining four authors are ranked top-100 in the list of Microsoft Academic Search. The influential authors found by Greedy have a similar phenomenon. The results show that neither DRIM nor Greedy simply ranks the influence of a single author. In fact, both algorithms select influential nodes that could maximize the influence spread.

 There are several future directions related to this work. First, we will parallelize Algorithm 1 to speed up the pro-posed framework. Second, we try to preprocess the network with clustering method to reduce the size of the influence matrix. Third, we believe that the idea used to solve the in-fluence maximization problem can be applied to solve other similar discrete optimization problems. Thus we X  X l extend our framework to solve other similar problems.
