 SIGKDD Explorations . Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 90 Below we describe the winning system that we built for the KDD Cup 2002 Task 1 competition. Our system is a Rule-based Information Extraction (IE) system. It combines pattern matching, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, semantic constraints based on the domain and the specific task, and a post-processing stage for making the final curation decision based on the various evidence (positive and negative) found within the document. Development and implementation were made using the DIAL IE language and the ClearLab development environment. The results achieved were significantly superior than those achieved using categorization approaches. Papers discussing the Drosophila genes and their products are lengthy and complex. They typically include not only text, but also images that are crucial for understanding the papers X  results. On the other hand, they usually have a relatively fixed structure and present results obtained using a set of known techniques (such as Northern or Western Blot). Since the focus of this task is the experimental results and not the other information within the paper, focusing on templates used within the figure legends, together with information within the title and the paper abstract proved to be sufficient for most cases. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe briefly our rule-based approach and in Section 3 we outline the actual implementation of the system in the DIAL language. In Section 4 we present the results and discuss briefly the advantages of our approach in comparison to other approaches. IE approaches can be divided into supervised, rule-based approaches and unsupervised (statistical) approaches. The most common unsupervised approach is Hidden Markov Model (HMM), see for example [3]. While unsupervised methods are generally considered less domain-specific and thus theoretically more attractive, actual implementations in complex domains such as the biomedical domain proved to be rather difficult. We believe that the rule-based approach is more suitable for the KDD Cup task. Presented at the most simplified level, this approach involves writing rules for matching the common patterns for the desired template (experimental evidence for a gene product expression), as in the figure legend:  X  Fig 4. Expression of dGATAc transcript  X . However, our approach involves more than simple pattern matching. It uses lexical resources, NLP tools and semantic constraints, achieving better coverage and accuracy. In [1] we described this approach in detail in the context of the SIGKDD Explorations . Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 91 The KDD task was unique in that the output required was not single phrases within the document, but a global decision regarding the whole document (whether it should be curated or not). In order to support this decision, the IE process included two main stages: (i) Extracting evidence from the title, abstract, figure legend and GenBank footnotes, keeping a score entry for the whole document and for each product (transcript/protein) of a candidate gene (ii) Using the scores to decide on the curation of the document and the products of the candidate genes, after processing the document: if a gene X  X  score is above a certain threshold, mark the gene as having an experimental result, and mark the whole document as curatable. Our system is implemented in DIAL ( D eclarative I nformation A nalysis L anguage), a rule-based general IE language developed at ClearForest. We outline its main elements below and give an example for a rule in Figure 1. More information is provided in [1]. The  X  X uilding blocks X  of DIAL are rules. Rules are sequences of Pattern Matching elements, augmented by a set of Constraints that the matched patterns must obey and by a set of Assignments of the rule X  X  parameters and/or actions concerning external variables / data structures. The Pattern Matching elements themselves can be either: literal strings found in the text (e.g.  X  expression  X ), a lexicon (called in DIAL wordclass, e.g. wcInducedVerbs in Figure 1), or another rule (e.g. ExtractedGene ). A sample constraint is shown at the end of the InducedExpression predicate  X  Stem must be a member ( InWC ) of wcInducedVerbs. (Otherwise, it isn X  X  an  X  X nduced Expression X ). DIAL enables the user to implement separately the different operations required for performing IE: tokenization, sectioning (recognizing sentence boundaries), and morphological and lexical processing, parsing and domain semantics. DIAL has built-in modules that perform the general tasks of tokenization and part-of-speech tagging. In addition, we have developed a general SIGKDD Explorations .
