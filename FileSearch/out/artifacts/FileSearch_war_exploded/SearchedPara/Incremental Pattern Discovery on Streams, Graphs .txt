 Incremental pattern discovery targets streaming applications where the data continuously arrive incrementally. The questions are how to find patterns (main trends) incrementally; or how to efficiently update the old patterns when new data arrive; or how to utilize the patterns to solve other prob lems such as anomaly detection? We first investigate a powerful data model, tensor stream (TS), where there is one tensor pe r timestamp. To capture diverse data formats, we have a zero -order TS for a single time -series (e.g., the stock price over time), a first -order TS for multiple time -series (sensor measurement streams), a second -orde r TS for matrices (graphs), and a high -order TS for multi -array s (Internet communication network, source -destination -port). Second, we develop different online algorithms on TS: 1) the centralized and distributed SPIRIT [7] for mining a 1st -order TS, as well as its extensions for local correlation function and privacy preservation; 2) the compact matrix decomposition (CMD) [5] and GraphScope [4] for a 2nd -order TS; 3) the dynamic tensor analysis (DTA) [2] , streaming tensor analysis (STA) and window -based tensor analy sis (WTA) for a high -order TS. All the techniques are extensively evaluated for real applications such as network forensics, clust er monitoring .
 Data mining, Stream mining, Graph mining, Tensor analysis. Incremental pattern discovery targets at streaming applications where data continuously arrive incrementally. In this thesis, we want to answer the following que stions: How to find patterns (main trends) incrementally? How to efficiently update the old patterns when new data arrive? How to utilize the patterns to solve other problems such as anomaly detection and clustering? Some examples include:  X  Sensor Networks [3] monitor different measurements (such  X  Cluster Management Error! Reference source not found.  X  Social Network Analysis [2] observes an evolving network  X  Network Forensics [2] monitors Internet communication in  X  Financial Fraud Detection [8] examines transactional To deal with the diversity of data, we introduce an expressive data model tensor from multi -linear analysis [6] . For the Sensor Networks example, we have one measurement (e.g., temperature) from each sensor every timestamp, which form s a high d imensional vector (first order tensor) as shown in Figure 1 (a). For the Social Network Analysis, we have authors publishing papers, which forms graphs represented by matrices ( second order tensors). For t he network forensics example, the 3rd order tensor for a given time period has three modes: source, destination and port, which can be viewed as a 3D data cube (see Figure 1 (c)). An (c)) has the number of packets from the corresponding source i to the destination j through port k , during the given time period. Figure 1 illustrates three tensor examples where the blue region indicates a single element in the tensor such as a measurement from a single sensor in (a), the number of papers that an author wrote on a given keyword in (b), the number of packets sent from a s ource IP to a destination IP through a certain port in (c). Focusing on incremental applications, we propose the tensor stream (TS) which is an unbounded sequence of tensors. The streaming aspect comes from the fact that new tensors are arriving continuou sly. (a) 1 st order (b) 2 nd order (c) 3 rd order Incremental Pattern discovery is an online summarization process. In this thesis, we focus on incrementally identifying low -rank structures of the data as the patterns and monitor them over time. In another words, we consider the incremental pattern discovery as an incremental dimensionality reduction process. In this sense, the following terms are interchangeable: summaries, p atterns, hidden variables, low -dimensional representations, core tensors. Let us illustrate the main idea through the network forensics application. In this example, the hourly c ommunication data are represented by high dimensional (3rd order) tensors, which are summarized as low dimensional (3rd order) core tensors in a different space specified by the projection matrices (see Figure 2 ). Moreover, the pr ojection matrices capture the overall correlations or hidden variables along three aspects (modes): source, destination and port. For example, the Source projection characterizes the client correlations; the Destination projection summarizes the server cor relations; the Port projection monitors the port traffic correlations. The projection matrices are dynamically monitored over time. The notation of projection matrices can be very general. In particular, we explore three different s ubspace construction str ategies: 1. orthonormal projection , which forms orthogonal matrices 2. exampl e -based projection , which judiciously select examples 3. clustering based projection , which consists of indicator The incremental aspect of t he algorithms arrives from the fact that model needs to be constantly updated. More specifically, the problems we study are as the fol lows: Given a stream of tensors, how to compress them incrementally and efficiently? How to find patterns and anomalies? W e plan to address two aspects of incremental pattern discovery:  X  Incremental update : We want to update the old model  X  Model efficiency : We want an efficient method in terms of The results from incremental pattern discovery can be used for many important tasks: Compression : The core tensor captures most of the information of the original data but in a much lower dimension. For example, our InteMon system [1] can achieve 10 -100X compression gain on performance sensor monitoring data of a data center. Anomaly detection : Fr om the core tensor, we can approximate the original tensor and compute the reconstruction error. A large reconstruction error often indicates an anomaly. Our CMD [5] and DTA [2] can successfully det ect abnormal network flows. Clustering : We can often cluster the original data based the projection. Our GraphScope [4] successfully identifies interesting groups and time segments on several large social networks such as Enro n email dataset. Thesis statement Incremental and efficient summarization of streaming data through a general and concise presentation enables many real applications in diverse domains .
 Incremental Pattern Discovery provides a unified view of se veral fundamental problems from the data mining perspective. A set of related tools are presented all embodying the same approach, i.e., the pursuit of efficient and effective algorithms for analyzing data streams automatically. Its success on diverse appl ications has confirmed the significance of all the algorithms. In this thesis, we addressed the problem from a data mining perspective, which emphasizes an algorithmic perspective and also provides a few system prototypes. In the future, all these techniqu es can be leveraged with a more system -oriented approach, such as deployment to de -centralized clusters and integration with existing monitoring systems.
