The 8th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS X  2006) was organized during 23 X 27 of May 2006 at Paphos/Cypus by the Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Commu-nication and Control (INSTICC) in collaboration with the University of Cyprus, the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the Athens University of Economics and Business. ICEIS has become a major point of con-tact between research scientists, engineers and practitioners in the area of business applications of information systems and has several tracks, including  X  X  X atabases and Information Systems Integration X  X ,  X  X  X rtificial Intel-ligence and Decision Support Systems X  X ,  X  X  X nformation Systems Analysis and Specification X  X ,  X  X  X oftware Agents and Internet Computing X  X  and  X  X  X uman X  X omputer Interaction X  X . ICEIS X  2006 received in total 404 paper sub-missions from more than 40 countries in all continents. After a double-blind review process, 63 papers (about 16%) were published and presented as full papers, in the conference proceedings.

The present special issue contains 3 revised and extended papers selected from the 8th ICEIS event. In par-ticular, out of the 35 full and short papers that were included in the proceedings of the track on  X  X  X atabases and Information Systems Integration X  X , 8 papers were initially selected for possible publication in the Data and Knowledge Engineering. After a two-rounds reviewing process, only 3 papers were selected for inclusion in the Data and Knowledge Engineering journal.

The first paper by D. Stojanovic, A.N. Papadopoulos, B. Predic, S. Djordjevic-Kajan and A. Nanopoulos is entitled:  X  X  X ontinuous range monitoring of mobile objects in road networks X  X . The authors propose a method for continuous range query processing for different types of queries, characterized by mobility of objects and/ introduces an additional pre-refinement step to support efficient, incremental reevaluation of continuous range queries in periodically performed refinement steps.

The second paper by E. Malinowski and E. Zima  X  nyi is entitled:  X  X  X  conceptual model for temporal data warehouses and its transformation to the ER and the object-relational models X  X . The authors introduce a tem-poral extension of the MultiDimER model. Temporal support is provided for levels, attributes, hierarchies, and measures. For hierarchies they discuss different cases depending on whether the changes in levels or rela-tionships between them are important to be kept. For measures, they study different scenarios that show the usefulness of inclusion of different temporal types. Further, since measures can be aggregated before being in-serted into DWs, they discuss the issues related to different time granularities between source systems and DWs. Finally, they finish the paper presenting a transformation of MultiDimER schemas to Entity-Relation-ship and Object-Relational schemas.

Lastly, the third paper by J. Groppe and S. Groppe is entitled:  X  X  X iltering unsatisfiable XPath queries X  X . The authors focus on the satisfiability problem for the queries formulated in the XML query language XPath, and propose a schema-based approach to the satisfiability test of XPath queries, which checks whether or not an
XPath query conforms to the constraints in a given schema. If an XPath query does not conform to the con-straints given in the schema, the evaluation of the query will return an empty result for every XML document.
Thus, the XPath query is unsatisfiable. They present a complexity analysis of their approach and an experi-mental analysis of their developed prototype, which shows the optimization potential of avoiding the evalu-ation of unsatisfiable queries.
