 There has b een increasing focus on creativity to design the unique solutions needed to address wic k ed probl ems in complex environments . This paper describes a process for creating such solutions using knowledge creation as the framework. Creativity is addressed from th e knowledge creativity perspe c-tive s focusing on combining external and tacit knowledge. The p aper contribution is to provide the modeling tools to support this design perspective by providing the tools and methods nece s sary to create solutions that provide value for stakehol d ers.
 Keywords: Knowledge creation, Design Thinking , Design Processes , Customization , Modelling Tool . The contribution of the paper is to show ways to create design spaces for knowledge creation in wic k-ed environments . Wicked environments are characterized by c hanging customer needs, high -competitive market sett ing , disruption of established business models, or the digital ization are only a few challen g es today X  X  enterprises must face . This ultimately leads to the requirement to design new products, services, or combinations ( Johnson, 2008). There is virtually a consensus that, to remain competitive, firms must continuously develop and adapt their business models. The paper draws on emer g ing ideas from design thinking and knowledge management and combines them to defin e an innovative a p proach of customized design processes addressing emerging needs.
 Design in wicked environments calls for creativity to provide the often needed unique solutions . A cre a tive solution is seen as new knowledge. Design thinking in this regard adds value to knowledge ma n agement through pr oviding tools that foster creating new knowledge in the form of new design s . Earl i er , Nonaka developed the SE C I model where knowledge creation passes through four phases -social i zation, externalization, combination and internalization. Further research in this area has led to the idea of a knowledge spa ce (Von Krogh, 2016) where the knowledge space can be seen as a canvas . The focus is on creativity , but at the same time to put creative ideas into practice to provide value to stakeholders . Such value s have been illustrated by e xamples that include PEPSI (Nooyi, 2015) and many others d e scribed in Liedtka (2013) o r Yee (2012). The challenge is to combine the open and what seems to be a chaotic process of idea generation in d e-sign into a formal structure that characterizes knowledge management . It must satisfy generic design requirements such as processes that are repeatable, focus on the problem rather than process , and ide n-tify in depth issues . Other important characteristics of d e sign thinking have been def ined by Martin (2009). It is here that systems are viewed from different perspectives and that stakeholders can see the system from these perspectives to develop insights into imaginative sol u tions. The emphasis here is on visualization of systems and look ing at systems from different perspectives to provide sol u tions while (2016 a ) ) . This often calls for a multi -disciplinary approach where stakeholders from different disc i-plines can s ear ch for altern a t iv e solutions and then through brainstorming combine the m in consistent ways that provides value for all.
 Design in complex environments requires new tools to be in troduced as design proceeds to address emergin g problems . The paper describes a modelling platform where modelling tools can be asse m-bled into knowl edg e space s to help d e signers in their creative tasks as suggested by Krogh (2014 The paper begins by describing the characteristics of knowledge creation spaces. ..
 Knowledge creation and design are two paradigms that have been emerging as ways to provide cre a-tive solutions to address increasingly complex problems. Solutions in complex enviro n ments are most often unique and call f or a creative and innovative ways to construct them. To some they require ima g-inative use of knowledge that can in Nonaka X  X  terms externalize and combine knowledge el e ments into unique solutions.
 In complex environments , we thus need to develop knowledge not only on how to create a solution but also on what is a good solution. It requires the ability to choose a design method that matches value that is to be created. Knowledge is often seen as familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something , such as facts, information, descriptions or skills, which is acquired through experience or education, by pe r ceiving, dis covering, or learning (Dorst, 2011, Beckman, 2007) from earlier work. stakeholders. In this, we define design thinking as providing the tools, practices and methods to create such new knowledge forms.
 One of the most important initial activities of design is to develop an in -depth und erstanding and knowledge of what is going on in a complex environment. Design must include a way to capture stakeholder values and then develop ideas , to find methods that realize these values. Dorst (2011) d e-fines design as a form of reasoning and differe ntiates it from co n ventional reasoning rationale. In this rationale often known as problem solv ing we know t he result we want to achieve and know how to achieve it and what methods to use; often known as deductive reasoning. This often requires the abi l-ity to decompose the situation in its most elementary form, and then r e combine it in new ways using elements of knowledg e. As shown in Figure 1 a design thinking activity (Beckman, 2007): Figure 1 . Design Thinking Activity Re a ders may see here th e correspondence to Nonaka X  X  SEC I process (1994) . Observations here closely correspond to socialization , whereas the frameworks are externalization of information gathered du r-ing o b servations. Ideation is then the combination of ideas into an implementatio n. What is needed to satisfy our goal is a set of models that can be quickly assembled into knowledge creation spaces that support Nonaka X  X  phases. The spaces should support collaboration by i nterdisc i plinary teams look ing at a current visualization s displ ayed on a canvas and record their views and su g gestions. The platform should pr o vide: To satisfy our first goal we need to show how to map SECI onto tools that fos ter creativ it y and su p port collaboration. The challenge is to balance the creativity with the forma lity of a manageable design process. Visual m odels (Martin, 2009 ) are increasingly used to provide the visualizations that foster creative and imaginative thought. Typical design thinking models , which are used in the design thin k-ing cycle of Figure 1 are shown in T a ble 1.
 Models for Externalization Analy z e the outputs of the Discover phase; Synthesi z e the Models for Internalization Taking product or service to launch; Ensure customer fee d back Table 1 . Som e tools used to create new knowl edge . To answer the second research question we define a knowledge creation platform that uses the creati v-ity enabling tools practiced in design t hinking. To do this we are developing CuTiDe (Customized D e-sign Thinking) , which is a metamodel based modelli ng platform integrating design thin k ing tools as shown in Table 1 and providing ways to create spaces as customized compos itions of these to ols . Th is en a bles selection and combination of tools to addresses a pa rticular problem and a certain skill level of the participants . We are thus customizing knowledge creation spaces to speci f ic needs. This section describes a platform that puts the tools togeth er by means of conceptual models, thereby support ing design process es . The relationships are the brainstorming sessions that create new models re c orded as artifacts. In current practice, sev eral online platforms like Development, Impact &amp; You ( http://diytoolkit.org/ ), and design schools like the Stanford dSchool ( http://dschool.stanford.edu ) support designers during the design thinking process. However, most of them only provide limited means when considering: i) formalization of the knowledge; ii) re -use of existing knowledge; iii) methodological support; and iv) tooling. This paper bridges that gap by introdu cing a novel platform . The idea is shown in Figure 2. The platform therefore contributes to the current trend towards collaborative and collective intell i-gence approaches in knowledge ma n agement (Johannsen and Fill, 2014).
 The modeling platform ( Hawryszk iewycz and Prackwieser , 2016) , has been developed as a project within the Open Models Laboratory (OMiLAB) ( www.omilab.org ), a physical and virtual enviro n-ment for modeling method engineering and tool development. OMiLAB fosters domain -specific co n-ceptual m ode l ing and provides all realized modeling tools on an open use basis (cf. Karagiannis et al., ( 2016b ) for an overview of realized modeling methods and tools). Designers can use a tool of their choosing and follow a procedure of their definition while cre ating new propositions. The designer can choose the most suitable depending on his /her knowledge, experience, or the appr o priateness to the task at hand.

In CuTiDe , we e x ternalize to circle diagrams like that shown in Figure 8 . This figure is a knowledge creation place for ex ternalization where we us e the persona maps and stories. It is possible to copy a modeltype from one space to a n-other to preserve continuity. It also shows a table of theme issues that need s to be resolved when co m-bining into a new system.

 Figure 9 then shows the combination of the themes into the business. The design thin k ing tool choosen here is the join t value proposition.
 Figure 9 A customized knowledge sp a ce to support c ombination . Th is paper described design thinking processes and models and their relationship to knowledge sha r-ing. It then showed how tools used in design thinking can supp ort the SECI knowledge creation pr o-cess and be integrated into a design methodology, in this case the Double Diamond method. Afte r-wards , it showed ways to su p port them with a flexible metamodel base platform and showed , how th this paltform can be used to support knowledge creation by customization knowledge creation spaces to the SECI phases. The realized platform can be downloaded and used free of charge in order to pr o-mote exploitation and create a community of design thinking practitioners .
 In the futur e, we are planning to use the platform in university courses and projects with industry in order to gather more feedback. Moreover, additional design thinking tools can be added as the pla t-form is open for extension. Lastly, making the platform available w ithin the OMiLAB community e n-ables the possibility to get further feedback from modelling experts all over the world. Beckman, S.L., Barry, M.
