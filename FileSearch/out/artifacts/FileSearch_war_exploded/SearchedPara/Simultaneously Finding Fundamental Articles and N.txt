 With the development of the World Wide Web, the number of on line publications has clear that there are increasing costs for researchers to conduct the task of paper survey. A basic question every researcher would ask is: Which papers are worth reading? bution. It is widely adopted in both the trad itional Institute of Scientific Information X  X  Impact Factor (ISI IF) [1] and modern sear ch engines such as Google Scholar, Micro-other paper B citing an existing paper A, the citation count of A will increase by 1. It is clear that citation-based systems are unabl e to differentiate between research fields. Further more, the intention of researchers in practice is usually focused on looking for rion, as citations accumulate over time. 
In this paper, we are particularly interested in the problem of finding significant ar-ticles even in the very early stages of a specific research topic. These articles should open up new scientific areas and have the potential to be continuously cited for quite a closely related to that of topic emergence detection. 
There has been great interest in analyzing general research trend from large amount of history documents [2-4][13][14]. Recent research has found that changes in net-work structure could be used to trace topic development [5][6]. In this study, we first model communities in the citation graph as documents related by a specific topic. The task of topic emergence detection is then formulated as identification of new commu-nities, which can be performed by comparing communities at two time periods. How-ever, communities are always varying over time: some members will join while some members may leave; one community will divide, and the other may fuse. To address the problem of community tracking, we employ a  X  X ode-guided community X  ap-proach, which can identify a new topic community by tracking the communities where the top cited nodes lie. After a new theme is detected in such a way, the papers mostly cited at this stage are then recognized as fundamental articles. We evaluate the proposed approach on a real-world dataset. Results demonstrate that our method can topics have a much longer lifespan than ordinary top-cited papers. evaluate the importance of publications. Besides the simple but widely adopted citation count [1] [7], a set of social network centrality metrics have been proposed for current evaluation systems. The work in [12] associated scientific theme with funda-mental articles. However, their analysis is conducted on co-word frequency, which emergence. topic models have been proposed to discover summaries of documents. Notable is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) style topic model [2] [13]. The authors of [4] also presented an LDA-style topic model, associ ating each topic with a continuous distri-bution over timestamps. Unlike other work based on LDA, their model does not dis-cretize time and does not make Markov assumptions for state transitions over time. In parameters in the model are estimated using an EM algorithm to obtain the theme overall tendency at a coarse granularity. How long can a highly cited paper keep holding researchers X  interest? 
Fig.1 (a) reports the yearly citation ranking for the top 5 articles in 1993. One can observe from this figure that the citation ranking for these articles decreases dramati-keeps staying in top 300 by 1996. From 1998, all of the top 5 papers even leave the top-1000 sequence. 
Next, we consider the problem of topic distribution of the top K articles. As the in-energy to read papers from all sub-areas, it is important to classify papers into different topics. Fig.1 (b) shows that the top 10 articles in 1993 belong to 3 topic communities. 
From Figure 1, following statements can be made: (1) A top cited paper may not have a high continuous citation over time. (2) Citation number does not reflect topic theme. 4.1 Fundamental Articles Identification and edge set E . Each vertex in V is an element from P . Each edge in E is of the form: of edge &lt; p i , p j &gt; which is exactly same as when p i is published. 
As citation reflects the admission from other authors, we intend to select fundamen-tal articles for researchers to read from this citation graph. 
Given the above defined citation graph, citation number of a paper is the degree of a node. It is easy to choose the nodes with the highest degree for users. However, as we have illustrated in the previous section, (a) citation number (degree) does not dif-ferentiate topics, thus can not well meet information needs today, (b) a current highly may not be papers we want to recommend. 
According to the paradigms of Kuhn [17], the life of a scientific theme follows the survive to further periods. In contrast, the follow-up research causes an existing theme to saturate and mature. From this, we can reach the conclusion that fundamental arti-before a fundamental article can be r ecommended as the one worth reading. 4.2 Article, Community and Topic ences among documents taken together comprise a citation network. Community structure is defined as groups of vertices within which connections are dense but be-tween which they are sparse [15]. Observation 1: Each paper must be part of an existing community when it first lished bibliography. Hypothesis 1: Generally speaking, the transformation of a community corresponds to strated by experimental results on Supreme Court dataset [5]. Experiments on KDD-Cup03 dataset also show very similar characteristics, which we discuss later. Modeling topic community: Given a scientific paper set P and a citation graph C P , in which the citation edges are more dense than those linked to any other community.
Community, cluster or group in other terminology, can be found by a variety of methods, such as community discovery, clustering and graph partitioning. However, current research on community discovery from documents works with only a static snapshot of network data [6]. These methods are unable to discover the temporal trends in community evolution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to focus on detecting the exact time a new community emerges. For this particular task, snapshots, and detect whether there is qu alitative change in a topic community. indicates that a new topic community can not appear suddenly, but rather must evolve gradually. Thus we propose the following definition. Definition 1. Indication of Topic emergence: When a sub-community (subset of a new topic is said to have emerged, represented by the sub-community. Observation 2: A new research topic must include recent most cited papers (top papers), otherwise it could not draw enough attention and have no chance to develop into a full-fledged community. 
Based on observation 2, we now present a  X  node-guided community  X  strategy to Two communities where the top nodes are located in successive time steps should be one community in different phases. We further have: Definition 2. Topic emergence time: time step at which the top cited paper separates from the old community and forms a new community. Definition 3. Fundamental article  X  the most cited articles that play key roles in the formation of new topics. 4.3 Topic Emergence and Fundamental Article Detection (TE-FAD) Algorithm topic can be detected by tracking the communities where the nodes lie in. If the com-mental articles. Definition 2 involves how to distinguish two communities. There are etc. For computational efficiency, in this paper we adopt Jaccard coefficient to meas-and fundamental article detection is shown in Figure 3. 
In Figure 3, line 1 initiates some variables, lines 2-3 find topic communities of cita-tion graphs at the all time period, and then assign each node to the community it be-longs to . Lines 4-10 find the new topics and fundamental articles. Line 5 finds nodes with the top K largest degree in Gi . Lines 6-10 search the communities where a highly predefined threshold  X  and this community has not entered the topic list, then lines 9-fundamental articles. 
For step 3, i.e., the topic community findin g algorithm, there exists a lots of algo-rithms to do this task. For a particularly implementation, we choose the fast modular-ity algorithm [15] because this algorithm is fast and parameter free. Input: G1, G2, ..., Gn : Snapshots of a series of citation graphs at time T1, T2, ..., Tn . control factor Output: TList -Topic List, Alist-Fundamental Article List Method: 2. for i = 1 to n 3. Find topic communities of G i , denotes the topic 4. for i = 3 to n 5. Find nodes with the top K largest degree in i G 6. for each node j n with the K largest degree in i G 7. if newTopicEmerge(C i-2 (n j ),C i-1 (n j ),C i (n j ), 8. if (C i ( j n )  X  TList) then 9. Tlist = TList  X  {C i ( j n )} 10. AList = AList  X  { j n } 
Line 7 in Fig.3 calls a procedure for detecting new topic, which is listed below. //Procedure for new topic community emergence detection Parameter: Output: true if a new topic emerges and C i+1 is a new Method: 3. if s 2 -s 1 &gt; 4. then return true; 5. else return false; We have conducted experiments on hep-th (high-energy physics theory) dataset from KDD Cup 2003 [16], which is based on arXiv, an e-print service in the fields of phys-352807 citations from January 1993 through May 2003. For each month m we create the relevant time sub-graph G 1 , G 2 ... . G 125 . In order to find the exact time when topic community appears, we ran the proposed TE-FAD algorithm on G 1 , G 2 ... G 124 . The parameter values we used were K = 5 ,  X  = appeared at Aug. 1996, Dec. 1993 and Dec. 1998, respectively. Please note that these with the 5 th column in Table 1, it is clear that the initial sizes of these three communi-ties are much smaller than their final sizes. That is to say, these topic communities are still in their very early stage when they are detected by our algorithm. 
Table 2 presents the fundam ental articles according to TE-FAD algorithm. For each citations . We can see that articles identified by our algorithm all have a high citation number, even after the emergence time of its relevant topic. This reveals that TE-FAD can help find articles that ought to be read shortly after their publication. In this paper we proposed a topic emergence and fundamental article detection algo-rithm TE-FAD which is based on community division and citation number. It can identify new theme emergence in a timely manner, using data up to a specific moment, while identifying fundamental articles in the new topics simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the topics found by our algorithm have seman-recommendation. The framework introduced in this paper can apply to many other support. Acknowledgments.
