 system using fuzzy approaches. Two types of identi fi cation (parameter identi fi cation and structure identi fi cation) are necessary for the fuzzy modelling ( Sugeno and Yasukawa, 1993 ). Parameter identi the determination of the parameters of the fuzzy model. In neuro-fuzzy systems, the antecedent and consequent parameters are opti-mised by a learning technique in the parameter identi fi cation step sub-groups. The fi rst sub-group is called input selection, and means the determination of the appropriate input variables from among all thepossibleinputcandidates.The second sub-group is the determina-tion of the number of rules ( Linkens and Chen, 1999 ).
 the model increases ( Alizadeh et al., 2012 ). Thus, an input selection procedure is employed to select the appropriate input variables ( Sindelar and Babuska, 2004 ). Up to now, many different input selection algorithms have been developed and utilised for the modelling, and the input selection of fuzzy systems (e.g., Chiu, 1994; Jang, 1996; Nakashima et al., 1997 ; Gaweda et al., 2001 ; Vieira et al., 2010 ).
 the variables and to determine the signi fi cant rules in the neuro-fuzzy techniques. The clustering technique can be performed based upon the input, output, and the joint input  X  output datasets ( Mascioli et al., 1997 ). Fuzzy C-mean Clustering (FCM) ( Bezdek, 1973, 1981 )isoneof the most widely-used clustering techniques in the fuzzy modell-ing studies employed from among the different developed clustering techniques, (e.g., Wong and Chen, 1999; Yao et al., 2000; Panella et al., 2001; Angelov, 2004; Panella and Gallo, 2005 ). The most important problem in the application of the FCM technique in the fuzzy mod-elling techniques for the determination of the rules is that the number of rules must be known in advance. The determination of the opti-mum number of rules is very important in fuzzy modelling, and fuzzy modelling with an optimum number of rules can achieve a generalised model ( Panella et al., 2001 ). There are two opportunities for this problem (1.utilizing of iterative techniques, 2. fi nding the optimal clusters) ( Tsekouras et al., 2005 ). Many studies have been endeavoured to determine the optimum number of fuzzy-rules (the number of clusters) (e.g., Chiu, 1994 ; Emami et al., 1998; Chen et al., 1998 ; Chen and Linkens, 2000; Tsekouras et al., 2005; Dong and Wang, 2011; Panella, 2012 ).

In addition, some methods have been developed that not only select the signi fi cant input variables for fuzzy models, but also dete-rmine the optimum number of fuzzy rules (clusters) (e.g., Sugeno and Yasukawa, 1993; Lin and Cunningham, 1995; Yinghua and Cunningham, 1995; Linkens and Chen; 1999; Chen and Linkens, 2001 ; Min-You and Linkens, 2001 ).

A neuro-fuzzy system is a fuzzy system which is presented in the network architecture and the parameter identi fi cation of the fuzzy system is performed by an automatic learning technique of an ada-ptive network ( Subasi, 2007 ). ANFIS (Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System) ( Jang, 1993 ) is one of the well-known neuro-fuzzy approaches, and it has shown appropriate results in the modelling of complex non-linear problems ( Alizadeh et al., 2012; Subasi, 2007 ). The parameter identi fi cation of ANFIS is performed by a learning techn-ique in an adaptive network ( Jang, 1993 ),butitneedstostructure identi fi cation.

In this study, a new structure identi fi cation scheme for ANFIS is presented, which is able to determine not only the signi fi input variables, but also the number of fuzzy rules (clusters).
There are some major objectives for the installation of air pollution monitoring networks in urban areas, such as the description of the spatio-temporal concentrations of pollutants and the validation of the mechanistic models which describe the transporting and the conversion of the pollutants in the atmosphere ( Van Egmond and Onderdelinden, 1981 ), investigation of the compliance of the concen-determination of critical air pollution conditions, and, consequently, decisions regarding the issuing of pu blic warnings or the imposition of temporary immediate emission reductions ( Chow et al., 2002 ), and the evaluation of the exposure of people and other vulnerable receptors to pollution, and the protection of public health ( Trujillo-Ventura and Hugh Ellis, 1991; Lozano et al., 2009 ).

To achieve the major objectives of air pollution monitoring net-work development in an appropriate manner, the number of air poll-ution monitoring stations in urban areas must be increased ( Stalker and Dickerson, 1962; Beaulant et al., 2008 ). Although an increase in the number of stations in a monitoring network leads to better achi-evement of the main objectives of the monitoring network develop-ment, it is very expensive ( Kanaroglou et al., 2005 ). The total cost of a monitoring network has a direct relation with the total number of stations in the network ( Hickey et al., 1971; Modak and Lohani, 1985 ), and it is the main constraint on the development of a dense air pollution monitoring network ( Trujillo-Ventura and Hugh Ellis, 1991 ).
There are about 0.32 cars and LDV (Light Duty Vehicles) per resident and about 100,000 HDV (Heavy Duty Vehicles) in Berlin. Berlin is situated approximately 200 km northwest of the industria-lised area at Germany  X  s borders with Poland and the Czech Republic, which is called the  X  Black Triangle  X  ( Lenschow et al., 2001 ). Although Berlin had a dense air pollution monitoring network in 1990s, it now has a small number of monitoring stations and many of its station have been shut down because of the high total cost of the dense monitoring network. One of the techniques for the densi fi air pollution monitoring network is the simulation of a virtual station that is completely free-of-charge. The idea of a virtual station was introduced by Ung et al. (2001, 2002) .

In this study, the shut-down stations in Berlin are virtually re-constructed by simulation technique, and these re-constructed (virtual) stations are added to the current monitoring network for the development of a dense air pollution monitoring network for Berlin. Here, a new structure identi fi cation scheme is developed and joined to the ANFIS technique for the simulation of some virtual air pollution monitoring stations in Berlin.

The European Union (EU) has set two limit values for PM10 (Particulate matter less than 10 m m in aerodynamic diameter) for the protection of human health. According to these limits, the mean daily PM10 concentration may not exceed 50 ( m g/m 3 )morethan35times per year, and the mean annual PM10 concentration may not exceed 40 ( m g/m 3 )( European Union, 2008 ). The concentration of PM10 in Berlin sometimesexceedstheEUlimit( G X rgen and Lambrecht, 2007 ). Accordingly, particulate matter as an important pollutant in Berlin is selected as an important case study, and virtual particulate matter monitoring stations in Berlin are simulated in this study. 2. Algorithm of modelling
In this study, an input  X  output database is introduced to the new structure identi fi cation algorithm. The algorithm of this new structure identi fi cation scheme is described in the next section. This structure identi fi cation scheme determines the optimum number of rules and the signi fi cant input variables from among the candidate input variables.

Then, the input  X  output database is divided into two databases (training and testing databases). Then, fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering technique ( Bezdek, 1973, 1981 ) is utilised for the clustering of the training database to the optimum nu mber of clusters, determined by structure identi fi cation scheme.
 An initial TS (Takagi-Sugeno) fuzzy inference system (Takagi and Sugeno, 1983) is developed by de fi ning the input and output member-ship functions. In this fuzzy system, each cluster is considered as a rule; hence, the number of fuzzy rules is equal to the number of clusters, developed by FCM.

Next, the parameters of the initial fuzzy inference system is tuned in an ANFIS architecture.

Finally, the performance of trained model is evaluated using testing database.

In order to clarify the modelling procedure, a brief explanation is presented, given that the ANFIS modelling procedure is a well-known technique.

First, the input  X  output database is introduced to the structure identi fi cation scheme. Imagine that the X and Y are determined as signi fi cant input variables and the optimum number of clusters is determined equal to 2.

The FCM clustering technique divides the data into two clusters and the initial TS fuzzy inference system initially adjusts a rule for each cluster as below: If X A  X  A If X A  X  A where  X  A p ; q 1 ; r 1 ; p 2 ; q 2 and r 2 are the constant values.
Then, the ANFIS architecture is utilised to tune the values of p ; q 1 ; r 1 ; p 2 ; q 2 and r 2 (consequent parameters) and the para-meters of the membership functions (premise parameters).
ANFIS has fi ve layers. The outputs of layer 1 are membership functions. In the second layer, the membership functions are multi-plied and the output of layer 2 is w i : w i  X   X  A
In the third layer, the w i values are normalised w i  X  X  w w  X  X  ; i  X  1 ; 2  X  .

 tuning of the premise and consequent parameters in the ANFIS (e.g., Jang and Mizutani, 1996; Mascioli et al., 1997; Tang et al., 2005; Ho et al., 2009 ). In this study, the hybrid of the gradient descent and least squares technique, developed by Jang (1993) ,is employed to tune the premise and consequent parameters. 3. New structure identi fi cation scheme method is utilised for the partitioning of the main MISO (Multi Inputs
Single Output) database to some MIS O sub-databases in a successive manner. Each MISO sub-database is converted to some SISO (Single
Input  X  Single Output) sub-databases. In each SISO sub-database, the non-linear relationship between the input and the output is deter-mined by a fuzzy curve fi tting technique, and a non-linear one-variable function is developed. Among the developed one-variable functions for the SISO sub-databases in each MISO sub-database, the best one for the output estimation is determined, and, consequently, the overall accuracy of the output estimation in the main MISO database is evaluated. The heuristic partitioning method is iterated to achieve the maximum overall accuracy of output estimation. When the heuristic partitioning method is terminated, the number of MISO sub-databases is utilised as the optimum number of fuzzy rules for
ANFIS. The selected input variables for partitioning in the heuristic method are considered as the fi rst group of candidate input variables and their relative importance are determined based upon the number of partitioning times of each candidate variable. In addition, the employed input variables in the non-linear one-variable functions are considered as the second group of candidate variables, and their relative importance are determined based upon the number of estimated output data by each variable. Finally, the suitable input variables for ANFIS are determined by the combination of the relative importance of two groups of candidate variables.
 technique, hence, its results are completely compatible with fuzzy modelling techniques (e.g., ANFIS). In addition, the main database is randomly divided into training and testing datasets in this new structure identi fi cation scheme. Hence, the algorithm of structure identi fi cation is iterated according to a user-de fi ned number of iterations, and, in each iteration, the main database is randomly divided again. Finally, the suitable input variables and number of fuzzy rules are determined based upon the combination of the results of all of the iterations. These iterations neutralise the effects of random dividing and generalise the results of structure identi fi is described in detail, step by step.
 where T 1 k is the median of X k in database D . Q 1 is the number of observations in each database and it is equal to M /2.

In the second iteration, it is decided which database should be divided into two smaller databases D 11 k or D 12 k .Imagine D selected for the dividsion and it is divided to two smaller databases by dividing the k 0 th variable of D 11 k in the second iteration. In the second iteration, D has been divided to three databases as below:
D 12 k  X  x t l ; y t ; t  X  1 ; ... ; Q 1 ; l  X  1 ; ... ; n if X where Q 2 is the number of observations in each database and is equal to Q 1 = 2. T 2 k 0 is the median of X k 0 in database D
This algorithm is iterated and the D is divided into more small databases. In general, D in the d th iteration is divided into d  X  1 small databases.

Which database is selected for the division into two smaller databasesineachstep,andwhich X k is the best one to be divided into the selected database?
First, the method for the determination of the appropriate X dividing a database is explained here. Then, the method for the selection of a database for the division will be explained in Step 4.
For the determination of the best variable for the division, all of the possible dividing options are performed. Hence, for the division of the D ds k into two smaller databases, n possible options are performed and 2 n databases are generated. The data in each generated database are divided into n one-variable databases.
Thus, when the j th variable is divided into two small databases, 2 n one-variable databases ( S ) are generated.
 Q d is the number of  X  x ; y  X  points in the one-variable database.
The relationship between X i and Y  X  ^ Y i  X  f j i X i  X  X  of S i j 1 is calculated by a fuzzy interpolation technique called IDS (Ink Drop Spread) ( Bagheri Shouraki and Honda, 1999 ). Similarly, the relationship between X i and Y ^ Y i  X  g j i X i  X  X  ; of S i j 2 is calculated. The accuracy of f j i and g j i variable functions) for the estimation of output ( Y )isevaluated.

North-eastern part of Germany. It has a population of 3.4 million residents and covers an area of about 900 km 2 .Atpresent,Berlinhas only 12 PM10 monitoring stations ( Fig. 1 ). At the beginning of the 1990s, it had a high level of airborne particulate matter concentration ( Lenschow et al., 2001 ), and it had a dense monitoring network with more than 40 stations, developed for the appropriate monitoring of the pollutants in the city ( SenStadt, 1998 ). The number of monitoring stations decreased great ly until the end of 1990s ( Lenschow et al., 2001 ). Fig. 2 shows some of these removed stations that are used as virtual stations in this study.
 data from these stations, represented in Figs. 1 and 2 . Table 1 shows the time period and the number of the concurrent data of each rem-oved station (the stations in Fig. 2 ) and some of the current stations (the stations in Fig. 1 ). The stations in Table 1 are either far from the main traf fi c lanes or the current traf fi c level around them has no signi fi cant difference with the traf fi c level in the time period of the simulations ( Table 1 ). In this study, the current stations and each removed station in Table 1 are considered as input and output variables for simulation, respectiv ely. Finally, each simulated remo-ved station is considered as a virtual station, and, consequently, the particulate matter monitoring network of Berlin is densi fi 18  X  30 stations).

A computer programme was developed in MATLAB (R2013b) for the implementation of our new structure identi fi cation scheme, and, consequently, ANFIS was also implemented in MATLAB. 4.2. Results and discussion For each row in Table 1 , an input  X  output database was created. The input and output variables in each database were the hourly particulate matter concentration of the stations of second and columns of Table 1 , respectively. Finally, 18 input  X  output databases were created. The structure identi fi cation scheme was applied to these databases, and, consequently, the appropriate input vari-ables and the optimum number of rules in the databases were determined ( Table 2 ).

Then, initial TS fuzzy inference systems were generated, after which the parameters of the fuzzy inference systems were tuned using ANFIS. After each training step (epoch), the performance of the model is evaluated by the testing dataset. If the error of the model is less than the previous step, then the training procedure is continued and the next training step is performed, otherwise the training procedure is terminated. The EU limit for PM10 is expressed as daily and annual scales, and, hence, the results of the hourly simulations of 18 virtual stations are converted to daily scales.

The results of the training of the 18 ANFIS model for the simulation of the 18 virtual stations have been presented in Table 3 . Then, the test dataset was employed for the evaluation of the performance of the developed models. The evaluation results of the 18 developed models for the estimation of the mean daily PM10 concentration have been presented in Table 4 . The R, MAE, RMSE, MBE, FOEX and MAPE values in Tables 3 and 4 represent the correlation coef fi cient, the Mean Absolute Error MAE  X  X  1 = n  X   X  q n  X  S i O i  X  X  , the Factor Of Exceedance  X  FOEX  X  X  X  n S 4 O = n  X  0 100  X  , and the Mean Absolute of Percentage Error MAPE  X  1 P i  X  1 j O i S i j = j O i j 100  X  , respectively. n is the number of obs-ervation data, O i and S i are the observed and simulated PM10 con-centration of the i th data, respectively. n S 4 O is the number of data whose simulated values is higher than their observation values.
The results of Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that the appropriate virtual stations have been simulated. According to Table 4 ,theMAPE of the developed models is less than 10 percent, and the correlation coef fi cients of the models are more than 0.94. In addition, the uncertainty of the daily PM10 measurement in Berlin is about 10 percent (K. Grunow, personal communication, 2014) and the percent of error for all of the simulations is less than 10 percent ( Table 4 ). These results demonstrate that the simulated stations have excellent performance for the estimation of the daily PM10 concentration. The MAEandRMSEofthesimulationsarelessthan2.4and3.4 m g/m 3 , respectively. In addition, the range of the MBE is between 1.0 and 0.5 m g/m 3 and the range of the FOEX is between 14.8 and 10.8 percent. It means that the simulated virtual stations have a small bias, and that some of the simulations have been over-estimated while others have been under-estimated.
 The scatter plot of the mean daily test data for 3 stations (MC 020, MC 027 and MC 080) has been presented in Fig. 3 . In addition, the time series which simulated and measured the daily PM10 concentration ( m g/m 3 ) in the test dataset of MC 020, MC 027 and MC 080 stations have been presented in Fig. 4 . Figs. 3 and 4 demonstrate the high accuracy of the developed models and imply the appropriate performance of the joined new structure identi fi cation scheme and

In this study, a new structure identi fi cation scheme has been developed. This structure identi fi cation technique is able to deter-mine the optimum number of fuzz y rules and select the signi input variables. This technique was joined with ANFIS in a modelling framework, and was applied for the simulation of virtual air pollution monitoring station in Berlin. The results of simulation of 18 virtual particulate matter stations for Berlin ( R 4 0.94 and MAPE percent) demonstrated the capabilities of this new structure identi-fi cation technique.
