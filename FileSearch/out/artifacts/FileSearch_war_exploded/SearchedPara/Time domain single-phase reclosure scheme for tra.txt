 1. Introduction
Customer costs due to electric supply interruptions, service restoration cost due to damages caused by mal-operation of circuit breakers and system transient stability are of great importance in deregulated power systems. Transients are one of the most common issues, which cause mal-operation of protec-tion devices and interruptions in power delivery. The most prevalent reason for transients in power systems are lightning, transmission lines switching and jiff contact by external objects.
Experiences show that almost 70% of faults are single phase faults, among which 80% are transients. In the case of self-clearing faults, the line could be re-energized by means of Single Phase Auto-
Reclosing (SPAR) that enhances reliability and promotes transient stability of power system. In this case, more than half of the transmitted power transits through the two robust phases because only the faulty phase is disconnected. However reclosing of permanent faults is not only unfavorable to system stability but also harmful to generators and other electric apparatus. A main concern in auto-reclosure schemes is to reduce the risk of the second shock to the system in the case of a permanent fault.
Although the conventional reclosures were simple in design and operation but the blind behavior due to adopting a fixed dead time also may cause a delay when there is a chance to reenergize the line adaptively after secondary arc extinction moment. So it is essentially important to (1) discriminate between transient and permanent faults avoiding reclosing on permanent faults and (2) distinguish the moment which the secondary arc being extin-guished in order to reenergize the line as fast as possible. As the result, the adaptive-dead time based schemes would prevent long time electric power delivery interruptions. This makes the adap-tive dead time methods more preferable than fixed dead time based methods. Nowadays digital protection has known to be the most common auto-reclosing control strategies.

Many sophisticated approaches ha ve been introduced to discri-minate between permanent and transient faults. For example Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to analyze current and voltage signals ( Djuric and Terzija, 1995 ).Themethodproposedby( Ahn et al., 2001 ) simply tracks the increment of RMS value of faulty phase voltage and compares it to a predefined threshold to detect second-ary arc extinction moment. A fuzzy logic based method is proposed by ( Lin and Liu, 1998 ) where one of the shortcomings is the complexity of developing fuzzy rel ations. The method presented by ( Elkalashy et al., 2007 ) uses the fundamental component of zero sequence instantaneous power and differential protection principles. This needs synchronization of line terminal communication channels signals. Some references ha ve used wavelet transform ( Sanaye-Pasand and Kadivar, 2006 ) and some others have used neural network ( Aggarwal et al., 1994 ) as control logics to reclose the breakers by recognizing certain di stinct features within the system signals. One of the disadvantages of neural network is the blind decision based on learning pattern s. Combinatorial approaches have been proposed to fulfill the requirements of single phase reclosing by means of advantages of both wavelet transform and ANN ( Yu and
Song, 1998 ). The algorithm presented by Radojevic  X  and Shin (2006) is based on fundamental and third component of voltage and current waveforms to lock the reclosing equipment on permanent faults. The arc voltage has been estimated by means of the least-squares technique through spectral analysis. The technique accuracy is dependent on the arc model and parameters. The THD factor of faulty phase voltage can also be used ( Radojevic  X  and Shin, 2007 ), considering the fact that the faulty phase voltage becomes polluted by high amplitude harmonics while secondary arc establishes. Novel signal processing methods by means of generalized multi-resolution morphology gradient ( Lin et al., 2006 ) and close-opening-open-closing morphology gradient ( Lin et al., 2007 ) filters have been used to extract high frequency comp onents of the signal to improve discrimination accuracy. These methods are specially based on sampling the current of transmission line phases, because the nonlinearity of the arc can be trans mitted to the currents of healthy phases by virtue of the mutual inductance of the transmission line.
The proposed method by Yan and Zengping (2008) is based on the fact that the amplitude of the cap acity coupling voltage is much larger in transients than in permanent faults. In EHV/UHV transmis-sion lines with neutral shunt reactors, this capacitance is partially or totally compensated and the proposed method could not guarantee accurate operation of relays. The work presented by Dadash Zadeh et al. (2008) has widely investigated line parameters effects on secondary arc extinction and pro poses some applicable rules to reduce dead time such as neutral reactors. A new yardstick based on learning error function of Adaptive Linear Neuron and voltage sampling has been applied to discriminate between transient and permanent faults ( Vahidi et al., 2008 ). A valuable and efficient method that discriminates faults b y comparison of calculated shunt reactor current and measured signal is proposed by Suonan et al. (2009) . This method has overcome the drawback of shunt reactor installation. But it needs the samp ling of both voltage and current of phases in addition to neutral shunt and compensating shunt reactor currents. It may also encounters problems while the CT is saturated.
A main drawback of some methods presented above is the need to determine threshold. Probabili stic classification methods such as
GMM could overcome this disadvantage. The GMM has been applied also used for multiple limb motion classification ( Huang et al., 2005 ), image processing and classification ( Zhou and Wang, 2006; Hamouz et al., 2005 ), control engineering ( Principe and Motter, 2007 ), simplification of controller design ( Ruano, 2005 ), tracking elliptical living objects in video frames ( Xiong et al., 2006 ), and rotating machinery fault diagnosis ( Marwala et al., 2006 ), but recently is used in power engineering ( Jazebi et al., 2009 ).

In this paper a time domain anal yzer with a suitable criterion using the principles of GMM is int roduced. A complete power system experienced an arcing fault is modeled in EMTP/ATP environment.
Different aspects which can influe nce the reclosure responses are investigated. GMM has demonstrated the ability to discriminate between transient and permanent faults in all operating conditions. 2. Basic principles of GMM
A suitable classifier should be fast and accurate. It is also essential to have the capability to be optimized for the unique patterns. The flexibility to be adapted to novel patterns is required because it must satisfy the real time uncertainties of fault signals. Although not essential, it should be trained in lowest computational effort. The GMM satisfies almost all above criteria.
The following describes the structure of GMM algorithm. 2.1. Definition
Mixture models are a kind of probability densities which provide greater flexibility and precision in modeling the underlying statistics pattern classifier, a set of GMMs f I 1 , I 2 , ::: , I S random variable x with D -dimensions follows a Gaussian mixture pattern, if its probabil ity density function can be formulated by (1) with constraints presented in (2):
P  X  x 9 I  X  X  k  X  1 , a k 4 0  X  2  X  sotheGaussianmixturedensityisacombinationof m Gaussian density function components, y k , k  X  1, 2, y m . In the previous equations a k is mixture weight for kth component, I  X f a model and y k  X f m k , P k g is the kth component mean and covariance, respectively ( Jazebi et al., 2009 ). Each component density is a D -variant Gaussian function introduced by a D 1 mean vector and
D D covariance matrix. The parameters P  X  x 9 y k  X  are normal prob-ability distribution swhicharedefinedby
P  X  x 9 y k  X  X  2.2. Training process
GMM training process is identical to estimate the parameters of I g so that the Gaussian mixture density can best match the distribution of the training feature vectors. For a set of n independent and identically distribution vectors X  X f x 1 the likelihood corresponding to a mixture is
P  X  X 9 I  X  X  which represents the likelihood of the data X given the distribu-tion parameters I . The goal is to find ^ I that maximizes the likelihood: ^ I  X  arg max
This function is maximized indirectly by calculating the logarithm of the above probability: log P  X  X 9 I  X  X 
This is log-likelihood function that is easier to calculate but not analytically. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is widely used to estimate the parameters of GMM ( Xiong et al., 2006 ). EM is an iterative algorithm which maximizes the likelihood prob-ability of GMM, P  X  X 9 I g  X  , given the data for that class. This algorithm consists of two steps. 2.2.1. E-step
In this stage the posterior probability of sample x i in the t th step is computed through the following equation:
P  X  l 9 x 2.2.2. M-step
This re-estimation process will continue by replacing ^ I instead of I  X  t  X  by using following equations: a  X  m  X 
X
Assuming S independent classes (models), the estimation problem of S class pdfs can be divided into S separate estimation problems ( Jazebi et al., 2009 ). 3. Modeling and data gathering
All data required to evaluate the proposed scheme is derived from simulations of a power system presented in Fig. 1 . The system consists of a 400 kV and 300 km power transmission line with the parameters illustrated in Fig. 1 . JMarti line model of
EMTP is selected. The line is compensated in both ends through 50 MVar reactors. An accurate representation of the arc model is an essential requisite for the fundamental design of the technique because of its nonlinear phenomena which could distort fault arc path voltage and cause high frequency details in aforementioned signal. For permanent fault simulation, a linear resistance is usually an adequate representation. For transient fault a non-linear arc model should be employed. Extensive research has shown that the dynamic volt-ampere characteristics of the electric arc can be simulated by the empirical equation ( Vahidi et al., 2008 ): dg dt  X 
G  X  where g k is the dynamic arc conductance, t is the time constant of the arc channel, G is the stationary arc conductance, i is the arc current, U o is the arc voltage drop per unit length along the main arc columns,  X  is the arc length and R is the total resistance of the cathode and anode region of the arc, which is independent of the current. The value of t , U 0 and R varies by characteristics of line and other environmental conditions. They could be estimated from EHV lab tests. The arc length variation could be approximated by the following equation for relatively low wind velocities from 0 X 1 m/s  X  t t s  X  X  where  X  so is the length of primary arc and t s is the moment of circuit breaker opening. Using the above mentioned equations a non-linear time dependent dynamic resistan ce representing the primary and secondary arc is simulated in t his study. Secondary arc current consists of inductive and capacitive components. The capacitive effect is much greater than inductive effect. This is dependent on Double circuit lines, Tower shape, operating voltage, overall tower geometry, transposition and line length ( Elkalashy et al., 2007 ). These parameters are of the characterist ics of the transmission line under study. Other effective parameters which have considered are the fault point located on transmission line, load variations, fault impedance and compensation shun t reactor with or without neutral reactors. Also the effect of auxiliary equipments such as four legged reactors and High Speed Grounding Switches has been investigated. Arc extinction time is usually smaller in symmetrically transposed lines in comparison to the lines which are partially transposed or are not transposed either. This parame ter is also getting smaller when using neutral reactor in compensated lines but in solidly grounded or isolated neutral of compensating r ector, this parameter increases ( Dadash Zadeh et al., 2008 ). Therefore these severe conditions should be evaluated. The voltage wavefo rm at the sending end of transmis-sion line has been sampled at frequency rate of 10 kHz. Totally 400 cases have been simulated to train the GMMs. 4. Characterization of SPAR
Fig. 2 a illustrates the voltage wave form in main stages of adaptive reclosing in presence of transient fault. Period (a) introduces pre-fault voltage waveform. Assume that a single line to ground fault has occurred. Primary arc is a high amplitude short circuit current which has passed through the conductors while bus voltage reduces in this stage (b). After a short time, protective relays open the faulted phase. Primary arc will be quenched by opening circuit breakers completely. Consequently some voltage is induced in the isolated phase due to capacitive and inductive couplings among the healthy and faulted phases. In spite of the breaker opening at both ends of the faulted phase, the induced voltage feeds current through arc in the faulted point causing secondary arc which can stop arc extinction after breaker opening (c). At the period ( d), the arc is extinguished. This process is the voltage recovery stage during secondary arc. The time at which the secondary arc is quenched by insulator deionization is called  X  X  X ead Time X  X . Therefore determination of secondary arc extinction moment in transient faults could reduce dead time and consequently the delay in system restoration. In the case of perma-nent fault ( Fig. 2 b), the fault is not cleare d during breaker opening and hence the single phase auto reclosing should be blocked. 5. Method principles 5.1. Fault characteristics
As mentioned before, the faults can be either permanent or temporary. Temporary faults are followed by arc. The plasma discharge in an arcing fault is a source of various harmonics. As the result, the line terminal voltage waveform is distorted by =0.8838 mH/km =0.04624  X  /km =0.0043  X F/km nonlinearity characteristics after the breaker trips. But it would be near sinusoidal after the secondary arc is quenched. Also the voltage of the faulted phase increases at this moment.
In contrast, during permanent faults usually the waveform has sinusoidal behavior except at the moment of fault. In many cases, the arcing will also continue with a permanent fault after the primary arc is extinguished. The reason is the insulation resis-tance will not usually become zero instantaneously. In the case of insulator contamination, or sagging of a line down to a tree, the permanent fault will have an arc across the reduced air insulation.
Therefore it is not practical to differentiate between a permanent fault and a transient fault by the presence or absence of an arc in the primary fault. However, the char acteristic due to the secondary arc still exists after the faulty phase is isolated ( Lin et al., 2006 ).
Therefore transient faults could be identified through detection of high frequency components generated during the secondary arc.
The voltage cannot be returned to the faulted phase in permanent faults and the transmission line should be completely switched off. In the event of transient fault, signal should be monitored continuously. The arc must be extinct and air gap at the fault point should be deionized before reclosing could be performed. This necessitates that reclosing would be performed by a delay ( Dadash Zadeh et al., 2008 ). Therefore it is necessary to monitor the line for this period of time. 5.2. Fault identification 5.2.1. Algorithm structure
First a phase selector locates the faulty phase of a single phase fault as long as a fault occurs. The identification process breaks into two stages. Stage 1 identifies whether a fault is permanent or transient. The second stage determines the moment of secondary arc quenching. For each stage two separate GMM blocks must be trained. Block 1 of the first stage is trained by the data gathered from primary arc of transient faults and the permanent fault signals. Block 2 of this stage is trained by voltage waveforms during the secondary arc. In the second stage, block 3 should be trained by post fault signals and block 4 by secondary arc signal.
After the training stage, GMM requires only a small amount of computation for decision-making. The faulty signal must first be fed into the blocks of first stage. The probability for each model should then be calculated. A decision will be made by comparison of the model output probabilities for a given observation sequence. The comparison process should be performed for 5 ms, if the likelihood probability of block 2 is higher than the output of block 1 during the period, the fault is transient, otherwise the fault is permanent and the reclosing relay should be blocked. During the secondary arc detection, the signal will be fed into the second stage blocks with a wider window. Block 3 and Block 4 will track the voltage signal until the likelihood probability of block 3 exceeds block 4. This fact should be monitored for a cycle to make sure that secondary arc is extinguished. After this process, the reclosing command could be established. This process is organized in Fig. 3 . Therefore four
GMM Blocks should be trained for two stages. The parameters of each GMM should be calculated off-line by training process presented in previous sections. The length of the windows should be selected according to the following criterions ( Lin et al., 2006 ): a) It should guarantee a steady output during the steady state operating condition. b) The length should be less than the time interval of any two neighboring singular outputs of the signal.

The step length of the second moving window has been selected higher since it should identify the steady state condition but for the first one which should classify two transients, the window is selected smaller. After investigating sufficient simula-tion tests the data window lengths have been taken 5 ms and 10 ms, respectively. Sliding motion is to put 1 ms and 2 ms of the new signals at the front of the window, and discard it from the end of the previous window for the first and second stages, respectively.

As mentioned before the identification process in each stage is based on comparison of two probabilities P 1 and P 2 . Assume that the faulted signal vector is x . The criterion could be defined by the following equation:  X  P  X  I 1 9 x  X  P  X  I 2 9 x  X  X  14  X 
Using the Bayes rule (14) can be expressed as  X  Assuming each fault model is equally the same and noting that
P  X  x  X  is the same for all models, the identification task can be summarized by finding the logarithm of the following equation:  X  Log  X  P  X  x 9 I 1  X  X  Log  X  P  X  x 9 I 2  X  X  X  16  X  or  X  Log where a k 1 , a k 2 and y k 1 , y k 2 are mixture weights, means, and covariance X  X  of two fault models. 5.2.2. Algorithm optimization
The performance of GMM would be increased if some para-meters such as model order, convergence criterion and type of covariance matrix are optimally selected. In this work, diagonal covariance matrices are selected. Different values of the conver-gence threshold were carefully examined and a value of 0.001 was found to be the one which fulfill the requirements. Experi-ences show that too many or too few mixtures would reduce performance or computation efficiency ( Jazebi et al., 2009 ).
Therefore, the optimal number of mixture components must be carefully examined by computation of classification rate pre-sented in (18) applying test data set and varying number of mixtures to achieve high classification performance. As it is obvious from Fig. 4 , a Gaussian model with 7 mixtures is best suited for first stage and 5 mixtures for second stage
CR  X  Correct classif ied transient events Total transient events 6. Simulations and case studies
A variety of simulation tests in the condition of different fault types and locations, etc., are carried out to validate the presented method. It is observed that the proportion of output probability of the blocks in worst cases is more than 1.25. This shows the robustness of the proposed scheme. Some general simulation results are given in Table 1 . The presented values are the secondary arc duration (dead time). The estimated time error is less than 10 ms in all simulation results. Following case studies has been selected from test cases to show the performance of the method in harsh situations.
 Example 1. A ground fault occurs on the phase B of the transmis-sion line at the distance of 130 km from substation number 1 and 20 degree inception angle ( t  X  0.1277 s). The breaker opens at 0.16 s. As the low inception angle reduces the faults the high frequency details of voltage signal reduces. But the algorithm performs well as identified the permanent fault. Voltage wave-form related to the receiving end of transmission line and the decision signal is depicted in Fig. 5 .
 Example 2. A temporary fault is applied at the end of the simulated transmission line. In this case the line is untransposed with no shunt reactor. The fault is occurred on phase A at t  X  0.22 s and the breaker opens at 0.26 s. The measured voltage from network 2 is illustrated in Fig. 6 . This transient fault has been identified in 2 ms ( t  X  1.08) after secondary arc extinction, but according to the imposed delay, the reclosing command issues 22 ms after the fault is quenched ( t  X  1.058). It means that the reclosure action could be made after the fault arc is fully extinct, which can avoid the wrong decision in the process of arc extinction and reignition.
 Example 3. A High Impedance Fault (HIF) occurs on phase B at the middle of the line with 80 degree inception angle. The breaker opens with two power frequency cycles delay. The algorithm performs well as identified the permanent fault. Voltage waveform related to the receiving end of transmission line and the decision signal is depicted in Fig. 7 .

Example 4. This case is a symmetrical transposed line with solidly grounded shunt reactors. A transient fault is occurred at 100 km from network 2 in t  X  0.25 s. The measured voltage from the relay point of view and the decision signal are illustrated in
Fig. 8 . In this condition due to presence of the compensation reactor the coupling voltage is modulated and the extinction time is longer than usual. The estimated extinction moment using the developed GMM based method is 1.211 ms, while the actual extinction moment is 1.205 ms. According to the imposed delay, the algorithm monitors the voltage for 20 ms after the estimated extinction moment.

Example 5. This case is an untransposed line with shunt and neutral reactors. A transient fault in 20 km from the substation number 1 takes place in 0.158 s. Circuit breaker opens the line with approximate 2 cycles delay. As it is obvious in Fig. 9 , the arc extinction time is considerably less than previous case due to presence of neutral reactor. The needed reclosure reclaim time is 231 ms which is 4.32 times smaller than the usual adjusted dead time in conventional auto reclosures (about 1 s). 7. Discussion through reclosing relaying scheme
Since the discrimination method based on GMM is performed with probabilistic characteristics of signals without application of any deterministic index, high reliable and accurate classification is achieved. The permanent fault and secondary arc extinction time can always be identified from the transient one by means of the proposed method no matter how the fault location and fault resistance change. In compensated lines with shunt reactors, the method behaves robust and trustable as well. If load resistance changes during normal operation conditions, it would not dras-tically change current and voltage of the busses as a fault may change, consequently the line current would be bellow or equal to rated current. The same happens for the voltage drop and oscillations. This means that protective relays do not operate following a load change as discussed in Section 4 . Thus the third block in Fig. 3 would not consider this as a SLG fault and the situation would be recognized as normal operating condition.
As discussed earlier in Section 3 , a main advantage of the paper is that a wide variety of simulation conditions have been considered. In this section, other advantage and disadvantages are highlighted.

Harmonic based methods could not represent fast yardsticks due to the delay of harmonic extraction procedure (one power frequency cycle). However time domain analyzers like GMM could classify patterns more accurate and faster. As the analysis performs in time domain, none of the components in the signals frequency spectrum are eliminated and so all of them are consid-ered. In contrast frequency domain analyzers i.e. filters, wavelet transform, Fourier transform, etc . can eliminate some discriminant features or significant frequency bandwidth information.
The work presented by Suonan et al. (2009) is only accurate in the lines equipped with four legged reactors. For example if the line is equipped with high speed grounding switches, the pattern of voltage waveform will be different and the method perfor-mance may not be accurate. But the GMM-based method is adjusted to these conditions by considering some such samples in training matrix.

Methods like ( Ahn et al., 2001 ) use a constant magnitude threshold for identification, so with a change in power system configuration or when implementing in other system with differ-ent voltage range, a new threshold should be defined. GMM-based method not only needs any threshold but also gives extra information like probabilities. Some of classification algorithms such as ANN classify patterns perfectly but the results do not determine the classification accuracy. The variance between probabilities of GMMs is a criterion in which higher extent in difference shows higher accuracy. This criterion is very simple. According to its probabilistic manner, GMM is flexible to over-come excessive operation uncertainties and trends occurring in a large scale power system. Moreover the scheme is adaptive which means the faster the arc winks out the more quickly the breaker reenergizes the line. In addition, since the method investigates the voltage waveform, it would not influence by CT saturation.
Although the proposed method can detect secondary arc extinction in less than 10 ms but it is suggested to apply a time delay about one cycle to improve the reliability. It is still a fast method in comparison to other published methods.
 In summary, the method has the following advantages: No need to set a threshold.
 No need to sample current waveforms.
 Fast identification (about half a cycle).
 Simple identification criterion.

Multi functionality (Identify the fault type and arc quenching time).

Its stochastic inherent best suited for a large power system protection which is full of uncertain parameters and fault conditions.

To validate the ability of the proposed method, a quantitative comparison study has been made with Radojevic  X  and Shin (2007) and Sanaye-Pasand and Kadivar (2006) . Since there was no access to the data sets used in latter publications, these methods were tested under similar condition and with our testing dataset. The classification rate is an appropriate gage to investigate the powerfulness of classification methods which has been calculated and presented in Table 2 . The comparison shows the superiority of the proposed scheme.

The algorithm could be applied to any power system transmis-sion line; the only limitation is preparation of enough accurate fault patterns. One should have complete power system informa-tion to simulate it precisely and get training patterns as accurate as possible. If recorded fault patterns are available, the models would be closer to reality and higher accuracies would be achieved. 8. Conclusions
Accurate identification of whether a fault is permanent or transient and secondary arc extinction time is the key to improve the performance of single phase auto reclosures in transmission lines. A time domain analyzer based on GMM models has been introduced to discriminate permanent and transient faults. The entire work has been broken down into the tasks of problem identification, method representation, data acquisition, classifica-tion, and performance evaluation. Required data set has been achieved through excessive simulations in EMTP/ATP platform.
The proposed method only operates by sampling of one signal, the voltage of faulted phase. The algorithm could identify sec-ondary arc quenching time less than 10 ms (fast discrimination for on-line applications). It has also satisfactory performance when applied on transmission lines compensated by shunt reactors. This scheme could increase the rate of successful reclosure, improve system stability and prevent equipments damage under the shock of permanent fault reclosing. The accuracy and speed of response suggest more investments in application of GMMs in advance reclosing relaying.
