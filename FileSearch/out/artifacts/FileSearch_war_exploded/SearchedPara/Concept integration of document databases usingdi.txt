Introduction tion (DDC), thesauri such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and subject heading lists such as Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) are defined as controlled indexing languages while keyword index-ing schemes are defined as uncontrolled indexing languages. An integrated information retrieval system
Traditionally, attempts have been made using standardization to achieve compatibility between indexing languages, for example the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) or the Dublin Core Metadata (DC). language of the other agency ( Lancaster, 1986 ).

Another conventional method is to create a new form of indexing languages. Macrothesauri, microthe-papers and projects ( Zhang, 1999 ). An intermediate lexicon is nothing more than a switching language.
Terms from various indexing languages are mapped (converted) to a term in a switching language. A mac-mation related to social and economic development ( OECD, 2004 ). A microthesaurus can be defined as of knowledge are divided into microthesauri. These thesauri are groupings of terms which are conceptually related by subject. An integrated vocabulary approach accumulates a number of computerized thesauri in a meaning, in which alternative names for the same concept are interlinked together and a number of rela-widely known projects is the Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLS) from the National Library of
Although these methods improve the compatibility of indexing languages considerably, it is too complicate and expensive to implement in a majority of information centers.
 In recent years, some projects such as MACS (Multilingual Access to Subjects) and CARMEN (Content
Analysis, Retrieval and MetaData: Effective Networking) have been carried out for the purpose of creating relations are classified into the following types ( International Terminology Working Group, 2004 ): in the source language. guage term, although the meanings of these terms are not precisely identical.  X  Broader equivalence and narrower equivalence: The term in the source language cannot be matched by an exactly equivalent term in the target language, but a near translation can be achieved by selecting a term with a slightly broader or narrower meaning.

Krause (2001a, 2001b) calls the lists of intellectually acquired links between the heterogeneous meaning terms  X  X  X ross-concordance X  X , whose aim is to find partial connections between existing indexing languages rather than to create a new form of indexing language or standardization ( Krause, 2001a, 2001b ). This means that a cross-concordance method only achieves partial compatibility of indexing languages. Gener-and domain experts. Furthermore, not all documents are indexed with controlled indexing languages. In relations between the keywords by means of a cross-concordance method, because the number of correlated keywords is not limited. Alternatively, statistically based measures, i.e. similarity measures, have been tested and implemented in a few projects. For example, the conditional probability is used in the CARMEN
Project ( Krause, 2003 ), and the log-likelihood ratio is used to produce LCSH heading/DDC number pair-languages can be approximated automatically, provided objects in a large enough database are classified that statistically based measures need few resources and can be used to supplement or replace a cross-concordance method ( Krause &amp; Marx, 2000 ).
 There are numerous traditional and well-known similarity measures, for example, Mutual Information,
Dice, Cosine, Jaccard, Overlap and equivalence index which are widely used in information retrieval and indexing languages are directional or asymmetric. Conversion from language A to language B is not the relations and the similarity of two correlated terms simultaneously. In theory, if two indexing lan-guages X  A (the source language) and B (the target language) X  X re compatible, for each term t in A there is a set of terms { t 0 }in B with the same meaning, which means that retrieval using { t assignment of broad terms or narrow terms.

Obviously, the major disadvantages of conventional similarity measures are identified as follows:  X  Most similarity measures are symmetric. equivalence X  X  or  X  X  X nexact equivalence X  X  or  X  X  X roader equivalence  X  X  or  X  X  X arrower equivalence X  X .
This paper describes a method for overcoming these problems. This method is the rough set-based trans-fer (RST) model. It provides a concept for integrating document databases using different indexing lan-guages. It is based on rough set theory and characteristics of indexing languages. Theoretically, the research results could also be used to integrate document databases using all types of indexing languages and different ontologies. 2. Preliminaries of rough set theory
Assuming we have a knowledge base K =( U , R ), where U is a certain set called the universe and R is the relation on U and denoted by IND ( R ). IND ( K )={ IND ( R ) j an approximation space. With each subset X U and an equivalence relation R 2 IND ( K ) we associate two subsets:
The terms R X and RX are called the R -lower and R -upper approximation of X respectively. Set R X is the set of elements of U which can be possibly classified as elements of X , employing knowledge R . as equivalence relations over U , the P -positive region of Q denoted by POS
If all or partial elementary categories of Q can be defined in terms of some elementary categories of knowledge P , then we say that knowledge Q depends in a degree k (0 6 k 6 1) from knowledge P , K is defined by of P . Therefore, there is a semantic relation between P and Q .

However, the measure k does not capture how this partial dependency is actually distributed among clas-ing knowledge P . Therefore, c P ( X ) can be used to measure the semantic similarity of knowledge Q with respect to knowledge P in each class of U / Q . c P ( X ) is defined by respect to the classification U / Q ( Pawlak, 1991 ).
 are given a knowledge K =( U , R ), U ={ x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x lence relations having the following equivalence classes: where Y 1 ={ x 1 , x 5 }, Y 2 ={ x 2 , x 8 }, Y 3 ={ x 3 }, Y
X 3 ={ x 3 , x 6 }, X 4 ={ x 4 } and X 5 ={ x 5 , x 8 }.

Thus PX 1 = / , P X 2 = Y 6 , P X 3 = Y 3 [ Y 6 , P X 4 = Y degree of dependency between P and Q is c P ( Q ) = 4/8 = 0.5, and c c ( X 4 )=1, c P ( X 5 )=0.

Assuming that there are two knowledge bases K =( U , R 1 )and K
IND ( R 1 ) IND ( R 2 ), then knowledge base K 0 is more specific than K . Knowledge R cation of knowledge R 2 ( Zhang et al., 2001 ). 3. The rough set-based transfer (RST) model
The RST model is based on two document databases. Each database is indexed with a specific indexing language. The identical documents in both databases are extracted with their indexing terms and two parallel corpora are then created.

Within the rough set theory, one corpus can be viewed as a knowledge base, attributes of which are la-language used in the corpus B be the target language. If the two corpora are equal knowledge bases, and terms P and Q are from the two corpora respectively, c P ( Q ) reduces to Formula 6 , c to P instead of c P ( X ).
 Assuming that:
C is the occurrence frequency of term Q in the corpus A .

C is the occurrence frequency of term P in the corpus B .

C is the co-occurrence frequency of P and Q in both corpora.
Therefore, we can transform the semantic relations between Q and P into the subsumption of two associ-ated sets based on Formulae (6) and (7) , just as follows:
Thus k 1 ( Q ! P ) identifies  X  X  X xact equivalence X  X , k 2 ( Q ! P ) identifies  X  X  X arrower equivalence X  X , k 2001 ) and identifies  X  X  X nexact equivalence X  X .

Pre-coordinate indexing language coordinates the terms at the time of indexing, whereas post-coordinate indexing languages put terms together at the time of retrieval. In general, a post-coordinate indexing language uses more terms to describe a single concept than a pre-coordinate indexing language. Exhaustiv-indexing length is the unique parameter quantitatively measuring the characteristics of an indexing lan-guage employed by a document database. Under the rough set theory described in Section 2, if two parallel corpora have identical indexing length, we say that they are equal and the semantic relations can be com-puted using Formulae (8) X (11) , otherwise the Formulae should be modified as a rough set-based transfer (RST) model. The RST model makes two parallel corpora roughly equal through a coefficient a .
The RST model is defined as follows:  X  If a = 1, the Formulae (8) X (11) are used.  X  If a &gt;1  X  If a &lt;1 Obviously, the basic RST model is used to integrate two databases using different indexing languages. mation retrieval system by mapping the terms of each indexing language to that of the others with the RST model. An alternative that avoids this requirement for vast computation time or complex computations is databases using only the indexing language of C . 4. Case study
Schlagwortnormdatei (Subject Authority File, SWD), a thesaurus developed in the domain of scientific (IZ) edited by the Social Science Information Center in Germany is post-coordinated. The parallel corpora (DDB) are generated from two library catalogues. One is created by the Germany Library (Die Deutsche Bibliothek) and indexed with SWD, and the other is created by the Social Science
Information Center in Germany and indexed with IZ. 33328 identical documents are collected in the par-allel corpora. 10260 distinct terms from SWD are used to index the documents in the corpus A ; whereas istics of SWD and IZ in DDB.

Riesthuis (1996) presents three compatibility levels. Compatibility at the level of terms is called term compatibility. Sentence compatibility means that an expression (term or sentence) of language A converts into a sentence of language B . However, in many cases the subject of a document is not expressed by one expression but by a combination of expressions. If the whole combination can convert to one expression in how to create transfer relations from SWD to IZ at three compatibility levels by means of the RST model. 4.1.  X  X  X ne to one X  X  transfer relations (1  X  1)
In the generation of  X  X  X ne to one X  X  transfer relations, each indexing term used in the corpus A and the corpus B are considered as an equivalence relation. Accordingly, the coefficient a is defined by Table 2 shows two documents and their indexing terms. Table 3 shows the term  X  X  X ffekt X  X  (affect) from SWD and its correlated terms from IZ. Each row represents one transfer relation.

 of their importance for precision ratio can be defined by
For a given term Q from SWD, we assume that P 1 , P 2 , ... , P which are created according to the decreasing order of the semantic relations.

If a user uses  X  X  X ffekt X  X  from SWD as the query term to search the above-mentioned library catalogue using IZ, no document can be found. However, it is surprising that more than 170 relevant documents ent terms but have similar meanings. 4.2.  X  X  X ne to multiple X  X  transfer relations (1  X  N)
One single indexing term cannot adequately express one subject or combined concepts in one document. equivalence X  X  or  X  X  X arrower equivalence X  X  or  X  X  X nexact equivalence X  X .
 sible term permutations is often very large. Our experiment finds that the maximum number of combined mented in our experiment. It is noticeable that a should be changed with the number of combined terms. a is defined by
For instance, a for  X  X  X ne to two X  X  transfer relations from SWD to IZ should be defined by The filtering criteria are the same as those for  X  X  X ne to one X  X  transfer relations.
For example, the term  X  X  X kademikerarbeitslosigkeit X  X  (graduate unemployment) from SWD is correlated with the following combined terms from IZ (see Table 4 ).
 4.3.  X  X  X ultiple to multiple X  X  transfer relations (M  X  N) tence compatibility level or a subject compatibility level.

In the majority of retrieval systems, Boolean operators are used to connect query terms. Any Boolean combination of terms in the initial query can be converted into a Boolean combination of target terms every useful combination of terms and operators. In practice, this process is quite complex and resource-intensive.

Obviously, it is easy to define the maximum number of N based on the methods for creating  X  X  X ne to multiple X  X  transfer relations, provided that we can determine the maximum number of M . According to Zhang (1999) , a user generally forms one query formulation with no more than 5 terms ( Zhang, 1999 ).
Therefore, we suggest that the maximum number of M be less than 5. Coefficient a is redefined accordingly by
For example, a for  X  X  X wo to two X  X  transfer relations is computed by
The term  X  X  X bweichendes Verhalten AND Jugend X  X  (deviant behavior AND adolescence) from SWD is cor-The filtering criteria are the same as those for  X  X  X ne to one X  X  transfer relations. 4.4. Integration of transfer relations
The above three types of transfer relations are implemented separately. However, their optimal transfer combined terms as possible and achieve the highest possible precision ratio.

P  X  k 4 ( Q ! P M 1 ) P Max{ k 4 ( Q ! P M 2 )}, if k 1 ( P !

 The optimal transfer relation is described as follows:
The transfer relations from IZ to SWD can be created analogously. 5. Experimental evaluation
In any real-world transformation task, the semantic relevance judgment between terms is highly subjec-precise transfer relations.

A cross-concordance method means that documentary and professional experts create semantic transfer
Science Information Center in Germany has already created transfer relations between SWD and IZ through a cross-concordance method. Although it works well for some terms, empirical studies have shown that such simple mappings will be restricted to a small subset of the terms in question ( Krause, 2003 ).
Transfer relations extracted from existing parallel corpora by mathematical methods are not based on human knowledge, but reflect the actual use of the indexing terms in the underling data. So they are more also created by the Social Science Information Center in Germany using a conditional probability based if the same document has been indexed by term P from the target indexing language. A probable transfer relation between term Q and term P is therefore defined by ( Hellweg et al., 2001 )
The JESTER tool was created to generate of transfer relations with a conditional probability based method. In JESTER, a few parameters such as the thresholds of occurrence frequency of terms can be manipulated simultaneously in one central configuration dialog and a small number of examples of transfer relations is determined ( Hellweg et al., 2001 ).
 was carried out on another parallel corpora (USB), in which the corpus A is created by the Cologne Uni-the corpus B is created by the Social Science Information Center in Germany and indexed with IZ. In our experiment with a conditional probability based method, DDB are the training data and USB are the test retrieval performance. No other techniques of hypothesis testing, for example chi-square, are applied. In this section, we will introduce the following four parameters to analyze the results achieved with the RST model, a cross-concordance method and a conditional probability based method.
It should be pointed out that transfer relations generated with mathematic methods are reviewed by index-ing experts. The error ratio is used to verify the correctness of different methods.
The matching ratio expresses the proportion of overlaps of transfer relations generated by mathematic methods from the whole transfer relations created by a cross-concordance method. The matching ratio measures the ability of one method to replace the cross-concordance method.
 the retrieval performance of the system with them ( Salton et al., 1983 ). The conventional performance parameters are the recall ratio and the precision ratio. Assuming that Q in the corpus A with query term Q from the source language, P corpus B with query terms P 1 , P 2 , ... , P i , ... , P
P are shown in Tables 7 and 8 .
Firstly, it can be seen from Tables 7 and 8 that the RST model achieves better retrieval performance than the conditional probability based method or the cross-concordance method. Normally, attempts to increase esting that the RST model improves the recall ratio and the precision ratio simultaneously.
Secondly, the error ratio of transfer relations created by the RST model is much lower than that of the conditional probability based method. It is important to note that the error ratio of the condi-tional probability based method in DDB was greater than 50% (see Table 7 ). The main reason is that one third of the relations are created in  X  X  X ne to multiple X  X  and  X  X  X ultiple to multiple X  X  transfer rela-tions. However, most of them are checked as failures by our experts. This shows that the indexing length bility levels.

In addition, the experiment found that a few transfer relations defined by the cross-concordance method cational opportunity) from SWD, the cross-concordance method defines the transfer relation A and the RST model identifies the transfer relation B . The transfer relations are shown as follows:
We can also see from Tables 7 and 8 that the RST model in the USB works as well as in the DDB. It proves that the RST model could also be extended in other cases, as long as the two databases collect enough documents in common.

Finally, it should be stated that the RST model finds fewer transfer relations than does the cross-con-cordance method. That is because the correlated terms usually occur less frequently than our defined thresholds in the parallel corpora.

In fact, none of the transformation methods is solely responsible for the concept integration of document one another. Therefore, we combine the transfer relations created by the three methods. Although the parameters in Tables 7 and 8 show that the retrieval performance decreases slightly, many more transfer relations are obtainable, something that is very useful for users. 6. Conclusion and future work
According to our investigation, there is no previous research focusing on the application of rough set theory in the concept integration for cross-searching of multiple databases. This research has shown that the RST model effectively links concepts of document databases using different indexing languages. It achieves better retrieval performance than the conditional probability based method and the cross-concor-defined by the cross-concordance method.

Our future research would focus on the performance of the RST model, if the co-occurrence frequency documents. More sensible relations with low co-occurrence frequency at document level could then be iden-parallel corpora.
