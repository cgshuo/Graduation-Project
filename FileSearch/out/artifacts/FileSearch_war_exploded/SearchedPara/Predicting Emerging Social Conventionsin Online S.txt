 The way in which social conventions emerge in communities has been of interest to social scientists for decades. Here we report on the emergence of a particular social convention on Twitter X  X he way to indicate a tweet is being reposted and attributing the con-tent to its source. Despite being invented at different times and having different adoption rates, only two variations became widely adopted. In this paper we describe this process in detail, highlight-ing the factors that come into play in deciding which variation in-dividuals will adopt. Our classification analysis demonstrates that the date of adoption and the number of exposures are particularly important in the adoption process, while personal features (such as the number of followers and join date) and the number of adopter friends have less discriminative power in predicting adoptions. We discuss implications of these findings in the design of future Web applications and services.

The importance of social norms in a society can hardly be un-derstated. They can affect our most basic perceptions [2] and are the basis of massive social movements [34]. They guide everyday behaviors of the general public [1] as well as those of the most extreme members of a society [43]. As a consequence of their im-portance, social norms have been the topic of a multitude of studies in anthropology [5], sociology [24], and psychology [17, 41].
Social norms may begin as social conventions, i.e., simple habits of social interaction. Over time, some social conventions become more strongly associated with the group identity and some even be-come so central that failure to obey the social convention results in censure X  X t which point they have transitioned from a social con-vention to a social norm. This transformation can serve multiple purposes; it reinforces the system that acts as a guide in social in-teractions [21, 33], enhances group identity and feelings of belong-ingness [36], and facilitates group performance on tasks by estab-lishing standardized roles [30].

The factors influencing an individual X  X  decision to conform to a social norm have been studied extensively in psychology [17]. In some cases, the individual is adopting a norm because they believe doing so leads to more accurate and useful judgments; that is, be-cause they believe it is practically useful to adopt the norm [20] and their peers are providing  X  X ocial proof X  [16]. For instance, one may believe that the reason everyone owns an iPod is because they are objectively better than the alternative portable music players. In these cases, factors like unanimity [2], the publicness of the ac-tion [20], the authority or personal importance of the source(s) [9], and the size of the relevant group [9, 26] all affect the probability that an individual will adopt a social norm.

In other cases, the motivation to adopt a social norm has more to do with a desire to build and maintain relationships with group members. In this case, the decision to adopt a norm has less to do with the correctness of the normative behavior but instead more with  X  X itting in. X  As before, the publicness of the action [28] is important, as is the extent to which the individual identifies with the group that embodies the norm. Similarly, the extent to which the norm is enforced by other members of the group [32] is important in the decision to adopt it. There are also individual differences that affect the likelihood of adopting a social norm, such as one X  X  need for social approval [47].

However, nearly all of these conclusions are based on the as-sumption that a social norm is firmly established in the group be-fore individuals are in a situation in which they could be influenced by the norm. While the factors that lead an individual to conform to a social norm of a group are well-studied, the factors that come into play when an individual decides to adopt a social convention are not as well understood. In this case, the decision to adopt a par-ticular convention has an impact on whether that convention comes to be widely adopted. This in turn could affect the likelihood it will ever become associated with group identity or become proscrip-tively normative.
 Social conventions can be established in many different ways. They may be created and enforced by institutions, such as the Inter-national System of Units for units of measurements. Many times, however, there is no established institutional code or even an in-stitution, in which case a convention evolves , arising from inter-personal interaction and spreading from person to person within a community [33].

In this research, we observe the emergence of a social conven-tion that evolves over time and document the characteristics of the convention, the environment, and the dynamics of competing varia-tions of the convention. Specifically we focus on the Twitter online community and the convention used to indicate that one is repost-ing a tweet to one X  X  followers while attributing the content to the source X  X n act commonly known as  X  X etweeting X  [10]. We study seven variations of this convention: RT, via, Retweeting, Retweet, HT, R/T, and the recycle icon. Utilizing a near-complete collection of tweets, we track the birth and spread of each of these retweeting variations over the first 3.5 years of Twitter X  X  existence.
There are several unique advantages in studying the retweeting convention. To begin with, the convention is specific to Twitter, therefore is unlikely to be imported from existing conventions in the way other conventions have been, such as greetings in other online communities [7]. This also means that before the convention was established, a user was most likely to encounter it through his or her contacts on Twitter. Consequently, another advantage of studying retweeting is that one X  X  contacts on Twitter are explicit, so we can observe how a convention spreads from one user to another. A third advantage is that the convention is not usable outside of Twitter, so nearly all uses of the convention will have been on Twitter, limiting potential exposures outside the environment.

Because we have nearly all of the tweets, this means that we also have nearly all of the uses of the convention. In other words, by studying this particular convention we can explore not just the micro-level processes of adoption or the macro-level outcomes but actually explore how one led to the other. Among many findings, some of our key results are as follows: 1. The final reach of the retweeting variations does not seem to 2. Nearly all adopters had been exposed to the convention 3. When users adopted multiple variations, they were loyal to 4. RT and via were the most popular in almost all geographical 5. The decision to adopt a particular variation has more to do 6. The number of exposures had more discriminative power
We built a classifier that predicts which variation individuals would have adopted at a given time X  micro-level prediction . De-spite much effort, it was increasingly clear from our analysis that the micro-level processes of convention adoption could not be eas-ily predicted. Before adopting a variation, most users (96.71%) had been exposed to it at least once, but this was not sufficient to predict the adoption. Considering a wide range of features, our classifier could achieve an accuracy of on average 22% improvement against the baseline (i.e, predicting 61% of cases correctly) and up to 65% improvement for less popular variations (i.e., predicting 82.3% of cases correctly). After ensuring stronger definitions of social ties (i.e., mentioning links) and adoptions (i.e., usage of at least 3 or 5 times), the overall prediction accuracy improved by an additional 10%.

The uncertainty in the outcome of which variation will be adopted at the micro-level perhaps may be intrinsic to the process of convention spreading. Similar to the uncertainty introduced by social feedback mechanisms [39], the choice of adoption may be in-herently difficult to predict reliably or accurately. This is especially likely given that a similar uncertainty is observed at the macro-level; what was once the dominant variation (e.g., via, Retweeting) was no longer the most popular after a few months.

This paper is one of the first to analyze the underlying process in the establishment of a social convention with a massive data set. We believe our research, although preliminary, opens the door to new methods for studying social conventions. In the future, we hope to replicate this study over a much longer period of time (e.g., 10 years) to examine how social conventions turn into social norms.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-tion 2, we review literature on social norms, social conventions, and social influence. In Section 3, we describe the Twitter data set and our methodology to extract variations of the convention. Sec-tion 4 presents the analysis of possible features that could be used to determine the adoption process of the convention and Section 5 presents the results of the prediction analysis based on these fea-tures. In Section 6, we discuss further implications of our work and we conclude in Section 7.
One of the first studies that observed the effect of norms on hu-man behavior was Sherif X  X  study on the phi effect [41]. In his study, peoples X  estimates of how much a dim light moved in a dark room not only stabilized when participants were organized in pairs or teams, but also converged to each other X  X  estimates. The influence of other people X  X  judgments affected the participants X  judgments of simple perceptual phenomena. This effect was more dramatically demonstrated by Asch [2], who asked participants to decide which of three lines was the shortest. One line was clearly shorter, but when a set of confederates all chose a longer line, participants con-formed to the group X  X  decision and gave an incorrect response in 37% of cases.

Since these studies established the powerful effects social norms can have, others have sought to identify the features that influence the decision to adopt a social norm. Cialdini and Trost [17] re-view a large body of work and highlight a few of the factors that have been identified as most important. One of the main motiva-tions they cite is merely the accurate interpretation of the world; when many peers adopt a particular behavior, it is a signal that the behavior is optimal in some way [20]. For instance, Stanley Milgram and colleagues found that a large number of people were induced to stare at blank space simply by having others engage in the same behavior [31]. The other main motivation Cialdini and Trost identify is the need to belong [6]. When this social affilia-tion need is activated, the perceived injunctive norm X  X hat one X  X  peers approve or disapprove of X  X ecomes more important than the descriptive norms X  X hat one X  X  peers actually do. These injunctive norms can be powerful; one study found it to be the second largest predictor of whether one would engage in extradyadic sex [12].
For both kinds of motivations, certain factors can influence the likelihood of adopting the norm. The perceived relative propor-tion [9] and absolute number [26, 28] of one X  X  peers who have adopted the norm are positively related to the likelihood of adop-tion. The greater the perceived similarity between one X  X  self and the perceived group, the more likely one is to adopt the norm [22]. Similarly, the more one values the group [9, 25, 32], the more likely one will be to adopt the norm. However, most or all of these fac-tors in the decision to adopt a social norm assume that the norm is firmly established in the group. There has been much less work on how people respond when social conventions are just emerging.
There have been laboratory studies on how conventions arise, most of which frame the emergence of a social convention as a solution to a coordination problem. One of the first to explicitly in-vestigate how people solve coordination problems focused on lin-guistic conventions for reference. In [46], participants were asked to develop short-hand verbal code for referring to images that al-lowed them to communicate more efficiently and therefore com-plete tasks with the images more quickly. As a result of the need to coordinate efficiently, the participants developed linguistic or pseudo-linguistic conventions. Such an experiment in a controlled environment allows the examination of the exact steps involved in the process of creating a social convention.

A more popular approach to study the emergence of social con-ventions has been to create mathematical or computational models that embody a theory, in order to demonstrate how a specific mech-anism could lead to the emergence of social conventions [3, 11]. In many of these models, the decision of agents to adopt a norm or a convention is assumed in the model [44] or proves beneficial to the agents because of the reward structure that is implicit in the model [27,42]. Even models that factor in social network structures in the emergence of a social norm do not focus on the individual X  X  decision to adopt the corresponding social convention [19, 40].
It seems plausible that when social conventions emerge, the indi-vidual X  X  decision to adopt a particular variation of a convention may not be simply the economically rational outcome of a coordination problem, but instead may be influenced by other factors such as the number or proportion of one X  X  peers who are using that particular variation and the desire to affiliate with the group that is using the variation. Moreover, since peer influence is clearly a factor in the decision to adopt an established norm and in the resolution of co-ordination problems, it is probable that the process may resemble other forms of social diffusion.
 In one of the seminal works on social diffusion, Christakis and Fowler find evidence for the spread of obesity [15] and coopera-tive behavior [23] through social networks (but see [18]). In [13], Centola studies the spread of behavior in an online social network experiment with almost 1500 users. The study shows that individ-ual adoption is much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. Even more importantly, Bakshy and colleagues [4] conducted an experi-ment on Facebook to demonstrate the role of social networks in in-formation diffusion. They randomly assigned users to be exposed to a link shared by a friend or to have the link hidden and found that users who were exposed to peer influence are 7 times more likely to share a piece of information than those who never saw the link.
These studies strongly suggest that peer influence is critical in the spread of information and normative behavior [15]. In this work, we seek to find the factors that influence an individual X  X  deci-sion to adopt one variation of a social convention over another. The factors we consider include the behavior of one X  X  peers, as well as the number and proportion of one X  X  peers who have adopted it. By identifying which factors play a key role, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the micro-level process underlying the emergence of a social convention.
This paper focuses on the retweeting convention in Twitter, which is used for indicating when a message is reposted while at-tributing the source. In this section, we describe the Twitter dataset and its high-level characteristics. We also present the methods we employed to identify the retweeting convention and briefly intro-duce the seven retweeting variations that we analyze in this paper.
We obtained the Twitter data set from [14], which comprises the following three types of information: profiles of 54 million users, 1.9 billion directed follow links among these users, and 1.7 billion public tweets posted by the collected users. The oldest tweet in the data set is from March 2006, when the Twitter service was publicly launched. The follow link information is a snapshot taken at the time of data collection in September 2009, while the user and tweet information is near-complete because user IDs were sequentially queried from all possible ranges (0 X 80 million) at the time of data collection. Therefore, this data set provides a unique opportunity to study the birth and progress of new collective behaviors in Twitter.
The Twitter network exhibits topological features that distin-guish it from other online social networks. First, although the distributions for both in-and out-degree are heavy-tailed similar to other networks, certain Twitter users have extremely large in-degrees (i.e., the number of followers), at a scale that is unprece-dented. The maximum in-degree is on the order of millions (as opposed to tens of thousands in other social networks). This is because Twitter users include celebrity and mainstream media ac-counts like Oprah Winfrey and BBC. Second, the social links are directional and only 23.8% of the links are reciprocal. In contrast, in other social networks social links are bidirectional by design or the majority are reciprocal. These differences should be taken into account when trying to apply the results of convention propagation described in this paper to a broader context.
Several different variations of the retweeting convention emerged during the first few years of Twitter [29]. They arose organically and became widely adopted by many individuals and third-party applications, until and even after Twitter rolled out the official, built-in  X  X etweet" button in November 2009. The retweeting convention typically had a syntax of  X  X oken @user-name repeated-text" [10]. We searched for this syntax in the tweet data set to find all potential variations of this conven-tion. Among them, we study the four most frequently used variations ( X  X T X ,  X  X ia X ,  X  X etweet X , and  X  X etweeting X ) and three lesser used ones ( X  X T X ,  X  X /T X , and recycle icon 1 , shown below). RT is short for  X  X etweet X  and HT stands for  X  X eard through X  or  X  X at tip. X 
We say a user adopted a given retweeting variation if the user has employed the variation at least once. Table 1 shows the number of adopters and tweets according to this definition. The two most popular variations, RT and via, reach 1.8 million and 750 thou-sand adopters respectively, yet the rest reach a far fewer number of adopters. In total, 2 million or 3.7% of all Twitter users adopted the retweeting convention and an impressive 59 million or 3.5% of all tweets ever posted used any variation of this convention.
Can be used by copying and pasting the symbol from Unicode symbol map. Table 1: The number of adopters and tweets per convention
The table also shows the date when the seven variations first ap-peared. The birth of the retweeting convention establishes that there is a need on Twitter to indicate a message is passed on from another source and to attribute the message to the source. The first variation ever used was via in the following context, which indicates that the original tweet message came from another user (@kosso). This tweet was posted in March of 2007, only twelve months from the launch of Twitter and only 4 months af-ter the first  X  X username X  reference appeared in Twitter.

For most variations, their invention seems to arise naturally from the need to replicate a message. Nearly nine months after via was invented, we see the the very first usage of RT: The tweet had exactly 140 characters, the length limit set by Twit-ter. This finding suggests that the invention of RT was a result of a previous variation being adapted to the constraints of the social environment.

The recycle icon, on the other hand, seems to have been created for the purpose of improving the existing variations, as it appeared explicitly in the discussion of which variation should be used on Twitter. The recycle icon variation was in fact the last one to be invented, in 2008 September. More details about the emergence process are described in [29]
The seven variations, although started at various points in time with different contexts, were invented to act as a convention indi-cating retweeting and once introduced in Twitter were subsequently adopted by other users who were exposed to them. In this work, we ask are there any features in the Twitter data set that would allow one to predict which variation would have been adopted by whom and when? As we demonstrate shortly, the final reach of these vari-ations does not seem to be strongly related either to the amount of time each variation had to grow or the rate at which it grew. There-fore, we sought to investigate the user-level traits and the social network characteristics that determine the adoption process.
The longitudinal tweet data set allows us to track how each of the variations was adopted. Figure 1 shows the time series of week-to-week usages over the first 3.5 years of Twitter X  X  existence. Via started early with a slow growth pattern relative to the other vari-ations, but ended with the second highest number of adopters. In contrast, RT started late but soon became a leading variation. The recycle icon, HT, and R/T continued to add new users, but their popularity seems to have nearly stabilized. Retweet and Retweet-ing once grew as fast or faster than any other variations, but never approached the reach of RT. In fact, they began losing popularity in late 2008, as the number of usages declined.

With respect to predicting the future popularity of a social con-vention, we focus on one specific problem, which we call the Con-vention Prediction Problem and define as follows: Suppose we are given a social network with records of users and times of adop-tions, but information about which variation was adopted by user u at time t is hidden. How reliably can we infer which variation v the user chose to adopt?
The prediction problem takes into account a wide range of features including personal preference (e.g., in-degree and geo-location of adopters) as well as social correlation due to homophily and influence (e.g., the frequency and degree of exposures from friends). We chose these features because they correspond to po-tential causes identified in the research on adopting existing social norms [17] and the diffusion of other social phenomena [4]. In the remainder of this section, we consider the effect of some of the key features in the emergence of the retweeting convention. Then in Section 5, we describe our solution to the prediction problem, considering the combined effect of all features.
One way to distinguish the small group of users who adopted one of the variations of the retweeting convention from the typical Twitter user is a simple count of one X  X  followers and followings. Adopters had higher in-degree than the average Twitter user. In fact, as can be seen in Figure 2, adopters have an order of magnitude more followers than the typical user. The figure also shows that RT and via were adopted by less popular users than the other variations. We hence consider in-degree and out-degree of adopters as one of the predictive features.

An in-depth examination revealed that in-degree distributions of the first 500 adopters were not particularly different from one varia-tion to another [29]. This finding may suggest that when a variation becomes extremely popular, it starts to be adopted by users beyond the circle of highly-connected core users and reach more periph-eral users X  X  finding that is in tune with the famous  X  X iffusion of innovations X  theory [37]. In contrast, adopters of the less popular variations may have never broken out of the core group of Twitter users who pay attention to the new trends and technologies of the service.

We also examined whether a user X  X  geographical location affects her decision to adopt a variation. It is possible that the conventions differed from location to location because of language or cultural differences. In order to infer the geo-location of adopters, we em-
Figure 1: Number of usages of different variations over time Table 2: The fraction of different variations in top 10 countries ployed two fields from user profiles: the location field and the time zone field. The location field is a free-text string entered by users, while the time zone field is a drop-down menu in Twitter. To re-solve the free-text string in the location field, we used both the Ya-hoo! Map and the Bing Map APIs (Application Programming In-terfaces) and obtained the country-level information for each user. The time zone field has a location name appended with the Unix Time offset, with which we can resolve the country individual users belong to. We annotated users with the geo-location information only when at least two of the three inference results matched. In this manner, we were able to retrieve the geo-location for 75.5% of all adopters.

Investigating the distribution of variations across geography, we found that geo-location had little impact in the spread of popular variations like RT and via. However, geo-location showed some variability for less popular variations like HT and recycle icon. Table 2 shows the top 10 countries based on the total number of adopters and the distribution of variations within that country. In all ten countries (and in most other countries not listed in the table), RT was the leading variation, followed by via. For the remaining variations, however, the ordering was not consistent. For instance, users in France and Germany preferred the recycle icon to Retweet, while users in Iran and Australia preferred HT much more than in other countries. In order to capture the effect of geo-location, we consider the country of the adopters as a predictive feature.
One of the key factors that is essential in convention adoption is exposures . These are so crucial because of informational influ-ence [20]; that is, users are made aware of the variation by their peers and as a consequence adopt the variation. This is especially true when conventions are first being established, because there is a utility simply in coordinating on the same variation [33]. Of course, it is likely that some users independently invented the same varia-tion or learned about the variations through some external source. However, because retweeting is specific to Twitter, there is a high chance that adopters of this convention were exposed to the vari-ation through their social contacts in Twitter. We call these users internal adopters .

Table 3 shows the percentage of internal adopters. It should be noted that these percentages are likely an overestimate, as the graph of social contacts is based on a snapshot at the end of the data set in mid 2009, and connections in online social networks are much more likely to be added than deleted. Nonetheless, the proportion of adopters whom we assume learned about the convention inter-nally is so high (96.71%) that it is unlikely the amount we over-estimate the internal adoptions would be so substantial as to affect our conclusions. The three most popular variations (i.e., RT, via, and Retweeting) have the highest fraction of internal adopters. The overall high rate of internal adopters indicate that exposure is a key factor in the spread of a convention. From this observation, we later consider frequency of exposure to a particular variation and the number of adopter friends as prediction features.

The effect of exposure sometimes became stronger with repeti-tion. Figure 3 shows a plot of the fraction of users who adopted a given variation after k of her friends adopted the same variation, as a function of k . RT and via show a two-phase pattern: a ramp-up to a peak followed by a decline, where the peak values are at k =20 and k =11, respectively. This observation indicates that the more a user is exposed to the variation up to these points, the more likely she will adopt it. The three lesser popular variations (i.e., HT, R/T, and recycling icon) do not have a ramp-up period and their peaks are at k =1. This means that for these variations repeated exposures were less effective than the first exposure.

Table 3: Percentage of internal adopters for each variation
Despite the fact that social exposure significantly increases the chance of adoption, it does not necessarily mean that the prediction problem is easy. The reason is two-fold. First, most adopters are exposed to not just one but multiple variations before adopting any of them. In fact, a mere 2.49% of the adopters were exposed to exactly one variation. Second, people do not always choose to use the variation that they are most frequently exposed to. Of those who adopted RT, 80.40% had been exposed to RT the most frequently. However, for the other variations, only 6.17% X 30.39% of adopters had been exposed to that variation more than any other variation.
Amazingly, despite the fact that nearly every adopter was ex-posed to more than one variation, a great majority of the users (72.68%) only adopted a single variation. Most others (24.47%) switched from one variation to another once or used two different variations back and forth. Only a small fraction of users (2.85%) adopted three or more variations. In order to understand why users adopt multiple variations, we analyzed how frequently users switch between different variations.

We approach this by treating adoption of convention as a Markov process, in which we model the usage of each variation as individ-ual states and switching from one variation to another as a transi-tion between states. These individual decisions to switch from one variation to another on aggregate also reflect the proportion of the population moving from one variation to another. Let the transition probability from state i to state j be P ij and let V denote the set of all variations. Then, we may calculate the probability of switching-in and switching-out of a particular variation i as P j  X  V P j  X  V P ij , respectively. The former represents the attractiveness of the variation, while the latter represents the loyalty of an adopter upon employing the variation.

Table 4 shows the two transition probabilities. RT and via have relatively low switch-out probabilities; once a user employs these variations, he will likely continue to use it further. Retweeting and Retweet have high switch-out probabilities; once a user employs these variations, he is likely to switch to another variation in the future. This is potentially because Retweeting and Retweet are at-tractive at first because of their straightforward meaning, but are costly for subsequent usages because of their long length, given the 140 character limit. In terms of the switch-in probability, HT and recycle icon have the highest attractiveness upon exposure.
We can also examine the switch-in and switch-out probabilities at different points in time. Figure 4 shows how the switch-out prob-ability changes for each variation when we divide the data set into four different time windows. During the first phase until Octo-ber 2008 X  X  year and a half after the first usage of the retweeting convention X  X here is not much difference in the switch-out prob-abilities across the seven variations. Until this time, the concept of retweeting was still settling within the Twitter community and there was no agreement as to which variation should be used.
However, by the end of the second phase in February 2009, RT became much more popular than the other variations, with hun-dreds of thousands of uses compared to only thousands for the other variations. After this time period, the switch-out probability for re-dundant variations of RT such as Retweeting, Retweet, and R/T show a sharp increase. This trend reflects the collective action that users who previously adopted these variations quickly switched to a new variation (i.e., RT). Other variations also exhibit changes in the switch-out probability over time, albeit at a marginal level.
This collective switch out action can be observed clearly in the state diagram of the Markov model in Figure 5, which shows the normalized switch out probability from each state so that the sum of probabilities outgoing from each state adds up to one. A transition in the model indicates what fraction of adopters of a given varia-tion ever switched out to another variation. A self-loop represents the fraction of adopters who used exactly one variation. Self-loops are more evident for popular variations than the less popular ones. When switch out happens, we find that RT and via are the most popular destinations. In particular, adopters of HT and recycle icon preferred to switch out to via, while adopters of all other variations preferred RT over via.

The time-varying switch-out probability implies that the choice of which variation to adopt is no longer a local decision but a global one, where individuals are affected by the phase of the entire con-vention spreading process. What seems to play a role here is the global popularity of each variation. In order to incorporate this finding, we later consider the date of adoption as a feature of the convention prediction problem.
In this section, we use features about a user X  X  characteristics and behavior on Twitter ( personal ), the behavior of those they follow on Twitter ( social ), and the date of adoption ( global ) to predict the behavior of individuals who adopted the retweeting convention in Twitter. By examining how well we can predict an individual X  X  decision to use one variation over another, we aim to understand which features play a key role in the adoption.
The quality of any prediction algorithm depends on the choice of features. Based on the observations from the previous section, we considered the following features from the three categories de-scribed above: (1) personal features including the join date, geo-location, in-degree, out-degree, the number of tweets, and the num-ber of URLs; (2) social features including the number of exposures to each variation and the number of friends who exposed the user to each variation; and (3) global features like the date of adoption. We Figure 5: Transition probabilities between different variations (Probabilities below 0.05 are not drawn for visual clarity.) consider the date of adoption because it correlates with the global popularity of the adopted variation.

Table 5 shows a sample data point. This sample represents a sin-gle adoption instance of an individual with different features at the time of adoption separated by comma in the order we introduced the features in the previous paragraph. The first number (i.e., 625) shows the join date of the adopter, in terms of number of days af-ter Twitter was started. The next number indicates the location of the adopter, Germany in this case. The third and fourth numbers are the in-degree (321) and out-degree of the adopter (167), respec-tively. The numbers of posted tweets (252) and URLs (57) are the next two fields. The next seven fields are the total number of ex-posures to the seven different variations, which means the adopter was exposed 54 times to RT, 22 times to via, 5 times to Retweeting, and so on. Similarly, the next seven numbers show the number of adopter friends: 30 RT-adopter friends, 18 via-adopter friends, and so on. The last number represents the date of adoption in terms of number of days after Twitter was launched, 665 in this case, which is 40 days after the user joined Twitter. The final field shows the target variation of adoption (RT) that we want to predict.
In order to determine the discriminative power of each one of the 21 features, we computed the chi-square (  X  2 ) value and the information gain. Table 6 shows the order of all features based on the  X  2 value, where a larger value indicates a higher discriminative power. The order of the features were very similar when ranked by information gain (i.e., the Kullback-Leibler divergence), and in both cases the top three features span all three categories: global (date of adoption), social (the number of exposures to RT), and personal (the number of posted URLs).

Analysis of the discriminative power of the 21 features brings two key insights. First, the fact that the global feature (i.e., date of adoption) had the most predictive power suggests that the deci-sion at the microscopic level X  X ndividuals deciding which variation to adopt X  X as more to do with the global popularity of the varia-tions than its local popularity or a user X  X  personal traits. Second, for each of the seven variations, the number of exposures had more predictive power than the number of adopter friends of that vari-ation. This difference is important because most existing models of diffusion and adoption, such as the independent cascade model or the linear threshold model, are based on the distinct number of adopting friends rather than the sheer volume of exposures.

Table 6: Predictive features and their discriminative power
To test the combined effect of the 21 features described in Ta-ble 6, we built a classifier that predicts which variation a user adopts given the time of adoption. Predicting which of multiple variations a user will adopt (i.e., multi-class classification) is hard in this case because the classes are unbalanced. In total, 68.2% of all adoptions were RT, which means that a classifier that always predicts that a user will adopt RT will achieve at least that level of accuracy. In contrast, all other variations had much fewer adopters, for instance, recycle icon was only adopted by 0.2% of users. This means a clas-sifier can achieve an accuracy of 99.8% for recycle icon by always predicting that the user did not adopt recycle icon, which is a very difficult baseline to improve upon.

For prediction, we used several classifiers in the WEKA machine learning toolkit [45] including SVM, Bayesian models, boosting, and decision trees. In particular, we used a popular ensemble clas-sification technique, bagging , to achieve very high classification accuracy. Bagging aggregates the decision from a number of clas-sifiers such that the accuracy is always at least as good as, and typically better than, the best classifier in the ensemble. In order to promote model variance, bagging trains each model in the en-semble using a randomly-drawn subset of the training set and then makes a prediction by taking an equally-weighted vote across all classifiers in the ensemble.

We tried many different combinations and subsets of the features and found that excluding 8 features (e.g., the number of adopter friends for each variation and the geo-location of the adopter) pro-duced the best result. Table 7 shows the results of the multi-class prediction by using a random half of the data samples for training and the other half for testing. We correctly predicted 72.6% of the instances. Compared to the baseline of 70.4%, which is also shown in the table, this is a marginal improvement (&lt;2.2%). Table 7: Result of multi-class prediction for each variation Weighted average 0.610 0.607 0.615 0.657
As mentioned earlier, the classes are unbalanced and this makes it hard to see how much each feature helps to predict an adoption. To investigate whether the features were at all useful for predicting which variation a user would adopt, we selected all of the cases where a target variation and another variation were adopted on the same date. In this way, we ensured a balanced set of adoptions and controlled for the shifting popularity that we observed in the multi-class prediction problem. After selecting these cases, we performed the analysis with the same tool, method, and features (other than the date of adoption).

Table 8 shows the results of predicting variations separately. The classifier could achieve the accuracy of on average 22.0% improve-ment over the baseline, which is now 0.50 for all seven variations. The classifier could more accurately predict the adoptions for vari-ations with fewer total adopters. In the case of HT, 82.3instances were correctly predicted, a 65This difference could be explained by the fact that adopters of these variations are in general more active and popular than the adopters of popular variations (Figure 2).
In order to understand the extent to which classification results are sensitive to any assumptions made, we repeated the prediction analysis with two stronger definitions of a social tie. Therefore, a user was not considered an adopter unless she had used a given variation at least three or five times. In addition, we considered the network structure based on user interactions rather than a simple follow link. In building the social network, we define user A to be linked to user B if and only if user A explicitly mentioned user B  X  X  name using  X  X username X  in her tweets at least twice, following the definition of a  X  X riend X  in [8]. Directing a post to someone is called a mention in Twitter. Compared to a typical follow link, a  X  X ention X  link represents a stronger social relationship.
Figure 6 shows the prediction results under these different as-sumptions about a social link as well as the results for the standard definition of adoption and links as shown in Table 8. The accu-racy when enforcing the 3-use threshold is better for the top five variations, but slightly worse for the bottom two variations. This is because having a stronger definition of adoption lead to fewer samples, and this meant the less popular variations had less data
Figure 6: Prediction accuracy under different assumptions for training. The overall prediction accuracy improved by an ad-ditional 5.4% compared to the previous prediction. Continuing to enforce a stronger definition (i.e., the 5-use threshold), however, did not continue to increase accuracy for the popular variations.
The prediction results for limiting the diffusion over the mention links as opposed to regular follow links are worse than the original prediction for all seven retweeting variations. This suggests that enforcing a stronger definition of social relationship does not nec-essarily improve the prediction power. This only resulted in cases where we could not explain the adoption process through social network. What seems more important is the exposure to the social convention itself, rather than the information source in the spread of retweeting convention in Twitter.
Our analysis suggests that the most important feature in predict-ing the user-level adoption was the global trend, as opposed to so-cial or personal features. This is surprising, as one would expect that for this domain X  X here the convention is only useful within Twitter and is most likely to be learned about from one X  X  peers on Twitter X  X he importance of local features would be greater.
There are, however, a number of possible reasons why the global trend would outweigh personal features. One could be that the Twitter culture was changing in ways over time that we did not measure or were unobservable. For instance, a different kinds of people could have joined Twitter, where the first group of people preferred via and later people preferred RT. Or it could be that inde-pendent of the new users, the culture within Twitter or even outside of Twitter was changing in some way that led users to prefer one variation over another (e.g., an increase in the sharing of breaking news and URLs). If this is true, it raises questions about how these changes in the culture are affecting the Twitter population en masse if it is not evident in the interactions between individuals.
We could also reasonably assume that some users prefer to adopt the more globally popular convention as opposed to the more lo-cally popular one. Users can get the global view in different ways; for example popular users and celebrities who are followed by many users could represent the global view. Users can also be ex-posed to a set of random tweets shown in the front page of Twitter or from the search results.

It is worth pointing out that just because a global feature proved to be the strongest predictor, it does not mean that the most popu-lar variation at the moment will necessarily receive strictly more adopters. Twitter was not a  X  X inner-take-all X  market. In fact, the dominant variant was no longer the most popular after a few months; the top ranked variation was initially via for nearly a year, then switched back and forth between Retweeting and via for half a year until RT became the dominant one in late 2008 (Figure 1). This means that there may be a process of constant re-evaluation within the Twitter community, through which the rank of the varia-tions could change.

A second key results is that the number of exposures had more discriminative power than the number of adopter friends. This is interesting because other work has suggested that the number of distinct adopter friends is crucial for predicting one X  X  adoption [28]. However, we saw that the number of adopter friends was less im-portant than the volume of repeated exposures. With respect to the effect of repeated exposures in adoptions, Romero and colleagues found a similar positive effect in the spread of political hashtags in Twitter [38]. They describe this as  X  X omplex contagion X  and explain that when a particular behavior is controversial or con-tentious, people may need more exposure to it from others before adopting it themselves. In the case of the retweeting convention, people may also need to be exposed to this new practice multiple times before they start to adopt it. This seems especially likely, since in the development of a social convention, as framed in the coordination problem [42], users require even more  X  X ocial proof X  before deciding to adopt the convention. How do social conventions emerge and settle in human societies? In this paper, we presented one of the first studies using large-scale empirical data to study the emergence of a social convention. The convention we study is not based on simulations or experiments in a controlled environment as in most existing work, but is an actual practice that was adopted by more than 2 million people in the pop-ular social network Twitter. The retweeting convention we studied is specific to Twitter, hence serves as a relatively clean case study in which we have records of nearly all usages and exposures of the convention.

Given the need to establish a convention for retweeting, a num-ber of variations of the convention emerged organically in Twit-ter. As we saw in the tweets of the early adopters, users ac-tively engaged in the discussion of which variation should be used. Throughout the course of the first few years, different variations competed to reign as a leading practice and in this process certain variations (e.g., longer ones) showed to be more easily abandoned than others. When it comes to individual X  X  decision to adopt a vari-ation, a number of factors such as social exposures and the date of adoption played an important role. However, predicting the adop-tion process at a user level turned out to be challenging.
There are several exciting directions to pursue. Since the fea-tures we considered only represent simple personal traits such as the node degree and geo-location, we believe more nuanced fea-tures about the adopters (e.g., socio-economic factors) would have the potential to improve the prediction. For instance, Pennacchiotti and Popescu demonstrated that users X  political affiliation, ethnicity, and affinity for a particular business can be inferred in Twitter [35], and these features may be useful for determining which retweet-ing variation a user will adopt. Furthermore, it is possible that by leveraging the features we studied as well as other potential fea-tures, one may be able to extrapolate to the macroscopic problem of predicting which variation would come to be the most popular based on early usages.
