 Social web platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr are used by millions of users daily, leading to a vast volume of semantically rich and dynamically updated social data. This data richness represents an unprecedented opportunity for any researcher inter-ested in modeling human interactions. Making sense of the data generated from social web platforms can also be important for developing new technologies and applications including sentiment analysis for elections, ad serving, and social recommender sys-tems. Various methods have been developed at commercial and academic laboratories for these purposes.

This special issue consists of eight articles accepted by ACM Transactions on Intel-ligent Systems and Technology Special Issue on Social Web Mining. The articles have been selected according to a strict review process. There were in total 33 submissions to this special issue, and each submission received peer reviews by three reviewers.
The accepted articles cover topics in mining the social web, including new approaches for prediction tasks (e.g., link predictions, tag recommendations, user preferences) and community detection for social networks. They also cover new approaches for topic modeling in social media including dynamically modeling sentiments and topics for social networks considering the underlying dynamics and personalized emerging topic detection.

The complex, highly dynamic temporal behavior of topics is clearly one of the distin-guishing aspects of social media. Not only it is important to determine topics and users X  views at any given moment, but also to track and describe their evolution over time in an interpretable manner. Four of the contributions to the special issue deal with this temporal aspect.
 The first such article,  X  X ynamic Joint Sentiment-Topic Model X , by He, Lin, Gao, and Wong, describes methods for dynamically building and incrementally adjusting the joint sentiment-topic distributions, allowing for a multiscale perspective. The second article,  X  X ersonalized Emerging Topic Detection Based on a Term Aging Model X , by Cataldi, Di Caro, and Schifanella, proposes a method for retrieving emerging topics, built on aging models for terms and topics, in real time and recommending them at the user level.

Arias, Arratia, and Xuriguera in their article,  X  X orecasting with Twitter Data X , study how much mood analysis in Twitter helps to improve prediction in time series when used as a complement to predictors that use standard information, in particular for predicting volatility in stock markets and movie box office revenues.

Finally, Lee, Caverlee, Cheng, and Sui in  X  X ampaign Extraction from Social Media X  study the problem of identifying orchestrated campaigns in social media, ranging from spam, celebrity promotion, and politically-oriented campaigns. Both graph mining and techniques for linking text posts to topics are used.

The interaction between network structure and user-generated content and how they are analyzed together is also a common topic of several articles in this special issue. The work by Lee et al. just mentioned is one of these.

Another article covering this topic is  X  X omputationally Efficient Link Prediction in a Variety of Social Networks X  by, Fire, Tenenboim-Chekina, Puzis, Lesser, Rokach, and Elovici. The authors propose methods for predicting the existence of missing or hidden links in social networking sites where either full information is not available or social links existing in the real world have not been transferred to the online network.
Cruz, Bothorel, and Poulet in their article,  X  X ommunity Detection and Visualization in Social Networks: Integrating Structural and Semantic Information X , propose ways of using the semantic and structural information (e.g., both content and links) for community detection, going beyond existing methods that look at the problem in purely graph-theoretic terms. They also propose a layout method that highlights both the role of nodes within communities and their role as bridges among communities.

Personalization in social network applications is clearly another important aspect for social network analysis (e.g., tag recommendations for social bookmarking systems). This aspect is common to the following two contributions.
 The work by Cagliero, Fiori, and Grimaudo,  X  X ersonalized Tag Recommendation Based on Generalized Rules X , shows how to build rules that can be used to recommend tags to partially annotate web resources; it exploits user-specific context as well as collectively gathered knowledge.

Finally, in  X  X ctive Learning Strategies for Rating Elicitation in Collaborative Fil-tering: A System-Wide Perspective X , Elahi, Ricci and Rubens, consider the setting for making recommendations when the data on user preferences are sparse and noisy. They propose active learning for this and systematically evaluate existing rating-elicitation strategies.
 We hope that you will find this fine collection of articles as interesting as we did. We wish to warmly thank the reviewers for their efforts in providing detailed high-quality reviews, ensuring the quality of this special issue. We would also like to thank Professor Qiang Yang, Editor-in-Chief of TIST for his support in preparing this special issue. Last but not least, we would also like to thank all the authors who submitted their interesting work to this special issue.
