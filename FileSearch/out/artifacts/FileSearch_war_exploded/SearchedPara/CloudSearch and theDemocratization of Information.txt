 Amazon CloudSearch is a new hosted search service, built on top of many cloud-based AWS services, and based on the same technology that powers search on Amazon X  X  retail sites. Because of its ease of configuration and scalability, Cloud-Search represents the next step in the democratization of in-formation retrieval. This democratization process, increas-ing access to search for both end users and potential search providers, has continued over several decades, through tech-nologies like early online metered search services, enterprise search software, web search, and open source search tools. CloudSearch further reduces barriers to entry, allowing a person or organization to basically say  X  X ake my content searchable X  and have it happ en automatic ally. CloudSearch may also offer an opportunity to overcome the stagnation that has occurred in search user experiences over the past 15 years. When you no longer need to be a search expert to make your content available, you X  X e not stuck with ten blue links. Instead, you can focus on providing the kind of interaction that makes sense for your application and your users. CloudSearch enables a flowering of search applica-tions that need not be tied to the web, and an opportunity to explore new ways of interacting with information retrieval technology.

CloudSearch is based on the product search technology developed by A9 for use by Amazon. This engine was designed from the ground up with semistructured data in mind, including support for faceted metadata and numeric range searches. And since tf  X  idf -style text matching isn X  X  always the most important ranking feature for many real-world applications, Cloud-Search provides relevance functions based on a configurable mix of query-dependent and query-independent features. In addition, the engine was designed for memory-resident in-dexes, with internal data structures that take advantage of this architecture.

CloudSearch relies on many proven AWS services, not only for raw computation (EC2) and storage (S3), but also for im-portant process components. For example, Elastic MapRe-duce (EMR) is used for index construction, Simple Workflow Service (SWF) for coordinating customer actions, and Elas-tic Load Balancing (ELB) for routing traffic.
The history of information retrieval is one of increased ac-cess, or what we call the democratization of search. This process has two aspects: increased access by end-users and increased access for potential search providers. New gener-ations of search technology were often accompanied by im-provements in one or the other of these kinds of access.  X  Web search. The rise of web search in the mid-to-late 1990s brought search to the general public for the first time. Eventually, end users could search the web from nearly any location and at no incremental cost. While this was a huge step forward in terms of end-user access to search, in some sense it offered less flexibility and control to organizations who had searchable content.  X  Open source search. The past 10 years have seen the growth and adoption of high-quality open source search tools such as Lucene/Solr and Indri in a variety of do-mains. Like enterprise search, these tools allow their users to decide what data to make searchable, but without the licensing fee. However, they still require a fair degree of skill to configure and maintain, as well as hardware to run on.
 CloudSearch represents the next stage in the process of de-mocratization, particularly for potential search providers. With CloudSearch, people or organizations who want to make their data searchable no longer have to choose be-tween putting it on the web and becoming search engine experts. Instead, they can essentially say  X  X ake this collec-tion searchable, X  and the service does the rest. There are several attributes of CloudSearch that make this possible:  X  Ease of configuration. To set up a CloudSearch do-main, clients provide data in XML or similar format, answer a few questions about the structure of the data via a simple dashboard interface, and they are done. In some cases Clo udSearch ca n automatically deduce the correct configuration from a sample of documents. If the client wants to experiment with the configura-tion  X  for example, to change which fields should be facets or how stemming is applied  X  this can be easily done from the dashboard, without the need to upload documents again.  X  No hardware or software management. This is one of the most obvious benefits of a cloud-based solution, but it is no less important for being so. The amount of effort required to install and operate a stable ser-vice running on one X  X  own hardware is nontrivial; keep-ing it up 24 x 7 while protecting against a variety of threats, both malicious and natural, requires a seri-ous investment. CloudSearch customers don X  X  have to worry about these issues. F urthermore, CloudSearch automatically upgrades the system with new software without incurring any downtime.  X  Scalability and Elasticity. Perhaps the most impor-tant benefit of CloudSearch is its ability to automati-cally scale in multiple dimensions. As the size of the data grows, the CloudSearch service will automatically repartition the index across multiple servers, providing horizontal parallelism. As the amount of query traf-fic grows, the service will automatically replicate the query servers, providing vertical parallelism. Further-more, the elastic nature of the service means servers will be added at peak times to handle the increased traffic, then removed later so customers aren X  X  paying for capacity they don X  X  need.
The early days of commercial search were characterized by the use of text-based interfaces and complex Boolean query syntax. As computers shifted from command-line to graphical user interfaces, interaction with search systems be-came much simpler. The widespread adoption of unstruc-tured queries also made a huge difference in search usability. Unfortunately, there has been little further improvement in search interfaces, at least those available to the general pub-lic, since 1995.

In the intervening years, a typical user X  X  computing power has increased by more than a factor of 50 and her bandwidth by a factor of 200. Operating systems such as Mac OS X and Windows 7 provide dramatically richer interaction, with photorealistic graphics, animation, and so on. Internet ser-vices allow multiuser video chat, immersive game environ-ments, and streaming HD video. Yet search interfaces, and web search interfaces in particular, have barely changed.
The reasons for this are complex, but one of them is that the web search market quickly became dominated by a small number of players who stayed with the now-familiar design. Many users have never seen a search engine other than a web search engine and assume this is just the way search is supposed to work.

CloudSearch offers an opportunity to overcome this stag-nation. First, it dramatically lowers the barrier of entry for a person or organization that wants to provide search as part of their application or service. A small business or organization that didn X  X  have the resources to offer search before now can. So there will be an explosion of new applica-tions and content sources, filling small niches other than gen-eral web search and aimed at a variety of devices. Second, search providers no longer need to be search experts. In-stead, they X  X l be experts in their own applications and their own ways of interacting with their content. Search inter-faces will be designed by and for photographers and music lovers and literature scholars, and the results will reflect the different needs of their diverse domains.
