 The goal of this tutorial is to introduce and discuss VerbNet, a broad coverage verb lexicon PropBank, and FrameNet. Since its first release in 2005 VerbNet is being used by a large number of researche rs as a means of characterizing verbs and verb classes.
 introduce the main VerbNet components , such as thematic roles and syntactic and semantic representati ons, and present a comparison with other available lexical resources. During the second part of the tutorial, we will explore VerbNet extensions (how new classes were derived and created through manua l and semi -automatic processes ) , and we will present domain -adaptation and tuning of VerbNet for real -world applications which require this. Th e last part of the tutorial will be devoted to discussing the current status of VerbNet; including recent work mapping to other lexical resources, such as PropBank, FrameNet, WordNet , OntoNotes sense groupings, and the Omega ontology . We will also present changes designed to regularize the syntactic frames and to make the naming conventions more transparent and user friendly. Finally, we will describe some applications in which VerbNet has been used.
 VerbNet overview: VerbNet extensions: VerbNet mappings and applications: groupings, Omega ontology ) Karin Kipper Schuler Karin Kipper Schuler received her PhD from the Computer Science Department of the University of Pennsylvania. Her pr imary research is aimed at the development and evaluation of large -scale c omputational lexical resources. D uring the past couple of years she worked for the Mayo Clinic where she was involved in applications related to bio/medical informatics including automatic extraction of named entities and relations from clinical data and d evelopment of knowledge models to guide this data extraction. Anna Korhonen Anna Ko rhonen received her PhD from the Computer Laboratory of the University o f Cambridge in the UK. Her research focuses mainly on automatic acquisition of lexical information from texts. She has developed techniques and tools for automatic lexical acquisition for English and other languages, and has used them to acqui re large lexical resources , extend manually built resources, and help NLP application tasks (e.g. parsing, word sense disambigua tion, information extraction) . She has applied the techniques to different domains (e.g. biomedical) and has also used them to advance on research in related fields (e.g. cognitive sciences). Susan Brown University of Colorado susan.brown@colorado.edu Susan Brown is currently a PhD student in Linguistics and Cognitive S cience at the University of Colorado under Dr. Martha Palmer X  X  supervision . Susan X  X  research focuses on lexical ambiguity, especially as it pertains to natural language processing tasks. Her research m ethodologies include psycholinguistic experimentation, corpus study, and annotation analysis. She has also been involved in the development of large -scale lexical resources and the design and construction of a lexically based ontology.
