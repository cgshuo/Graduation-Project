 We adopt the concept of human infra structure as our analytic lens to examine two high energy physics collaborations. Our analysis goes beyond the macro level of vi rtual organizations to include the human infrastructures in sc ientists X  home institutions and personal networks. While previous literature tends to focus on the macro level of analysis of management and coordination within virtual organizations, our study concentrates on individual scientists, especially junior scie ntists X  gains and challenges when participating in international collaboration. We compare the experiences of scientists from lesser-resourced and well-resourced nations to examine how specifi c components of basic social structures enable or impede individual scientists X  participation in international collaboration. Identif ying the social mechanisms that constrain scientists will enable us to better understand how to build human infrastructure to facilitate individual scientists X  participation in collaboration. K.4.3 [ Organizational Impacts ]: Computer-Supported Collaborative Work; K.6.1 [Proj ect and People Management]: Systems Analysis and Design Design, Human Factors Human infrastructure, Internati onal collaboration, Collaboration between differently resourced nations, High energy physics The advancement of science, technology, and education depend increasingly on internationally dist ributed scientific collaboration facilitated by virtual organizations [8]. International collaboration allows researchers to tackle complex research problems by harnessing the creativity of distri buted investigators and applying locally-based scientific resources [14].Virtual organizations bring about rich opportunities, but previous research has identified many challenges in distributed collaboration, including difficulty in establishing and maintaini ng common ground [6], trust among collaborators [28], poorly designed incentive systems [12,25], and differing organizational structures and governance systems [13]. Lee et al. [17] assert that most prior research on distributed scientific collaboration focuse s on management and social coordination within virtual organizations. They argue that virtual organizations are  X  X ot so virtual X  because participants in virtual organizations are enabled or constrained by their home institutions. Researchers of distributed collaboration contend that the unit of analysis should extend beyond the boundary of virtual teams. More research is need ed to understand how resources, policies, and administrative a nd management structures in individual researchers X  home institu tions shape their participation in collaborative projects. We also need to understand how individuals X  personal networks, existing outside or along with traditional and virtual organizati ons, enable them to overcome organizational constraints and access information and resources [17,22]. We studied human infrastructure in two large international high energy physics (HEP) collaborations with a focus on the social processes that shape and are affected by dynamic relations among participants from differently resourced nations. Human infrastructure is defined as  X  X he arrangements of organizations and actors that must be brought into alignment for work to be done X  ([17], p491). Infrastructure mediates between  X  X ocal X  and  X  X lobal. X  The theoretical framework of human infrastructure allows us to examine not only the dynamics within virtual organizations, but also the impact of local organizations and personal networks on the effectiveness and productivity of individuals. In this paper, we seek to understand how different components of human infrastructure facilitate or impede individual scientists X  participati on in international collaboration and how we can improve human infrastructure to facilitate scientists X  participation in international collaboration. Our research makes two contributions to the literature of distributed scientific collaborati on: (1) Previous literature on the social practices of distributed collaboration tends to focus on macro analysis of coordination and management within virtual organizations. In our study, through examining multilayered human infrastructure, we intend to connect individuals with the administrative and management in frastructure in which they are embedded and to reveal how human infrastructures constrain and enable individual participants in collaborations; (2) Prior literature often considers all participants within the same rank as uniform, and directs little attention to the impact of scientists X  position in the social structure of science. Scientists X  national, institutional, and research cultures, their home institutions X  policies and resources, and their personal networ ks define their position in the social structure of science. In our study, by comparing scientists from both well resourced and lesser resourced nations and institutions, we reveal the impact of human infrastructure on participation in international co llaboration by scientists with various backgrounds. A large body of research on distributed collaboration has been performed in scientific resear ch settings. Sonnenwald X  X  [29] review paper synthesizes factors th at have an impact on scientific collaboration. Political factors affecting scientific collaboration include the leadership and organizational structure of participating institutions and participants X  learning from each other. Socio-economic factors include adoption and implementation of information and communications technology. Resource accessibility, individuals X  social networks, and personal factors can also affect scientific collaboration. Much of our knowledge of distributed collaboration also comes from studies of corporate settings, where virtual teams collaborate at a distance, adopt information technologies and social practices to help them coordinate and collaborate to accomplish their work (for review, see [26]). A large component of  X  X omputer Supported Cooperative Work X  (CSCW) examines distributed collaboration and technologies and social practices that facilitate its success (e.g., [23]). CSCW research focuses primarily on the situational components, such as technology used, habits of use, and so on. Studies in organizational behavior and management concentrate on virtual team members X  inherent characteristics (such as expertise, motivation to collaboration, leadership, etc.) and the collaboration structure that help maximize the integration of individual efforts (e.g., [3]). Some research leads toward a more comprehensive understanding collaboration. Olson and colleague s [24] develop the Theory of Remote Scientific Collaborati on (TORSC) based on their own research on collaboratories and pr evious studies of distributed collaboration. The TORSC first de fines a broader range of success measures, including effects on science itself, science careers, learning and science education, inspiration for other collaborations, funding and public perception of collaboration, and tool use. The TORSC then asserts that there are five clusters of factors that are critical to success in distributed collaboration, including the nature of work, management, planning and decision-making, common ground, collabora tion readiness and technology readiness. Other researchers note that litera ture on distributed collaboration tends to focus on coordination a nd management within virtual teams, but fails to reveal the dy namics of interaction between the virtual organizations and the local organizations from which participants in distributed collaboration come. Lee et al. [17] point out that virtual organizations are actually  X  X ot so virtual. X  Through the conceptual lens of hum an infrastructure, Lee et al. examine multiple layers of the local organizations that support distributed collaboration in virtual organizations. Researchers involved in distributed collaboration rely on their local organizations for resources su ch as research equipment, computing services for data storage and analysis, subject recruitment, etc. Lee et al. also discuss how researchers X  personal networks shape and are shaped by their participation in distributed collaboration. Lee et al. recommend considering the variations in researchers X  personal networks and local institutions. However, they did not address how differences in researchers X  personal networks and institutional backgrounds may result in different corresponding locations in the social structure of science, which will ultimately affect participation in collaboration. In CSCW and team science literature, discussion of researchers X  differential locations in the social structure of science has been limited to rank (i.e., senior vs. junior) and disciplinary differences [31]. Previous studies in the sociology of science have shown that scientists X  productivity is affected by their working environments [1,18,19]. Prestigious institutions promote scholarly productivity, while non-prestigious institutions often fail to do so. However, this line of literature does not specify which environmental factors lead to the productivity differe nces between scientists from prestigious and non-prestigious institutions. Nor does the literature discuss how institutiona l affiliation affects scientists X  participation in collaboration. Some researchers hypothesize that distributed collaboration facilitated by virtual organization has the potential to enable scientists from lesser resourced in stitutions to overcome the limits of their local institutions and access resources and highly productive researchers from other institutions their local institutions cannot afford [10]. A large portion of the literature on collaboration between developing and developed countries focuses on how collaboration change s the structure of science and how this change may affect scientific outcomes. For example, Duque et al. [9] study the relationship between collaboration and scientists X  self-reported productivity in developing areas. They find that, in general, collaboration is not associated with an increase in scientific productivity. They also find that although access to email helps attenuate research problems, difficulties in research are defined more by na tional and regional contexts than by the collaboration process itself. They suggest that benefits brought about by information technology might be attenuated by the local conditions, which conf ounds the relationship between collaboration and scientific productivity. They did not explain how the national and local contexts interact with information technology, which in turn affects the collaboration process and ultimately affects scientific productivity. We studied two experiments in high energy physics X  X EP1 and HEP2, which are two virtual organi zations that share similar goals and management structures. The enormous size of the HEP1 and HEP2 collaborations is unprecedented. Both require great amounts of funding and human res ources. HEP1 consists of 3000 scientists from 38 countries, while HEP2 consists of 3200 scientists from about 41 countries. In order to join either collaboration, participating institutions typically obtain support from funding agencies in their home countries. The main instruments of HEP1 and HEP2 are placed in Institute X, which is located on the border of Switzerland and France. Institute X is also the physical center of HEP1 and HEP2. Institute X is comprised of 20 European member states. Funding from the member states is allocated or controlled by Institute X and experiment leadership. Other funds are controlled by participating institutes in accordance with the experiments X  Memoranda of Understanding. The HEP collaborations aim to accomplish two major tasks: to build and maintain detectors (which are used to measure properties of particle s passing through them), and to perform physics analysis. Scientis ts work in different workgroups and subgroups, which are aligned with different parts of the detector and the different particles their physics analyses target. We adopt qualitative research methods to analyze complex relationships such as research collaborations. Our research is informed by, but not limited to Lee et al. X  X  [17] conceptual framework of human infrastructur e. We sift evidence about how physicists X  home institutions exert systematic influence on participants in the HEP collaborations. We compare individuals and research groups coming from resource rich and resource poor institutions along three dimens ions: culture, which includes language, interpersonal styles and research cultures associated with nations and institutes; pers onal networks within and outside the collaborations; and organizati on structure, the management and policies within the virtual organizations and participating institutions that support the HE P collaborations. These three dimensions largely determine the position of countries and individuals in the social structure of science and within scientific collaboration groups. Infrastructure is invisible until it breaks [30]. In the HEP Collaborations studied, some collaboration participants X  concerns come up again and again, and we examine those concerns because we agree with Ribes and Finholt [27] that tensions  X  X eveal[s] conflicting goals, purposes, and mo tivations of participants. X  Understanding the causes for these tensions enables us to understand how human infrastructures facilitate individuals X  participation in international collaboration in some ways and imped it in other ways. Our data collection includes 24 semi-structured interviews complemented by field observati ons and document analysis. We focus on sub-projects of HEP1 and HEP2 that involve close collaboration among Chinese, Korean, and Japanese scientists and their partners in the U.S. and Europe. The lead author of this paper interviewed five Japanese, seven Chinese, four Korean, one German, one French, and six U.S. scientists. She conducted field observation in Institute X for three weeks. She also visited three home institutions for Chinese par ticipants and stayed at each institution for a week. Except that one interview was conducted via Skype, all the others were face-to-face. She interviewed junior and senior scientists to re veal different perspectives. Analysis of interview data and field notes was performed using NVivo 9.0 software on transcripts of the interviews and field notes, which were coded by speaker, topic, and themes and then codes were cross checked with one of the other authors. Main themes were coded and analyzed by the constant comparative method [21]. We compared soci al and technological processes involved in international co llaboration formation and how collaboration members relate to one another, especially regarding similarities and differences in work process. The HEP collaborations involve many countries, and the management of these virtual or ganizations does not have power over individual countries. Yet, thousands of international participants work together towards the same scientific goal. We find that the human infrastructure of the HEP collaborations interfaces with a communitarian, competitive, and reputation culture, which motivates physicists to contribute their very best efforts. The epistemic culture in high energy physics is characterized by a  X  X ommunitarian structure X  that emphasizes  X  X ollective ways of working X  and  X  X erases] the individual as an epistemic subject X  [15]. Within an experiment, researchers align themselves with different workgroups and work ta sks. The division of labor in HEP collaborations is based on wo rk tasks, which then provide the loci for the formation of work groups [4]. When building detectors, workgroups were form ed based on the components of the detector such as inner detector, muon, trigger/data acquisition, etc. There are also different work groups for physics analysis, including Higgs, B physics, top phy sics, Heavy Higgs, SUSY, etc. The Higgs group includes subgroups such as gluton-gluton fusion, Vector Boson fusion, and WH/ZH Higgs. The communitarian culture of HE P collaborations is highlighted by  X  X yperauthorship. X  X 2,7] Pub lications from HE P experiments include thousands of authors. The rationale behind the  X  X yperauthorship X  is that all th e scientists and engineers that contribute to detector building and physics analysis should be credited. A high energy physicist  X  X  name may appear on hundreds of papers, some of which they have never read. The hyperauthorship system distinguishes HEP from other fields, such as biomedical science, because it is difficult to use publications to evaluate individual high energy physicists during the hiring and promotion process. However, the communitarian culture does not extend to crediting high energy physicists collectively when it comes to hiring and promotion. Hiring and promotion evaluations are still based on individual achievements, which are measured by a person X  X  reputation in the work community and word-of-mouth recommendations. Competitiveness also thrives in the high energy physics community. The reputation system encourages participants in HEP collaborations to strive hard to  X  X et noticed X  and obtain a favorable reputation. Participants X  contributions in daily work are the basis for evaluation. Even though a researcher X  X  name may appear on hundreds of papers, a researcher knows which papers are  X  X y pape rs X  and the community would also know in which papers the researcher made a major contribution. The fierce competition in the HEP community and the pressure individual researchers feel every day is represented by this Korean postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Kim X  X  1 statement: All scientists X  names appearing in this paper are pseudonyms. Participation in research group meetings, contribution to data analysis, presentations at conferences, and writing internal notes are all opportunities for participants to increase their visibility as well as chances for them to be evaluated. This motivates researchers to contribute their best efforts to build up their reputation. In addition to making intellectual contributions, researchers also strive to build their reputations through service work. In the HEP collaborations, service work includes maintenance of the detector X  X  hardware, data genera tion, and other activities that do not directly produce physics results. Performing service work well means others will seek out their help and their skills will be valued. Researchers said that through service work, they can become known as a  X  X eliable X  pe rson. For example, a U.S. doctoral student working in a highly competitive physics analysis group commented that U.S. and Eur opean scientists dominated his group. However, a Japanese pos tdoctoral fellow became noticed amid the fierce competition within the group because he was in charge of the data production task and people became very reliant on him. Displaying leadership is another way for researchers to  X  X et noticed. X  Senior researchers mentioned that they hoped to give junior researchers opportunities to increase their visibility. Thus, they try to offer opportunities for junior researchers to take leadership roles, such as serving as conveners for different workgroups, as sub-workgroup team leaders, and as editors for major papers. When asked about their career development plan, many junior researchers mentioned that they would next endeavor to be a team leader and then a convener. A postdoctoral fellow from Germany, Dr. Haufmann mentioned: Leadership is related to service work because it is time consuming to manage people from different cultures and with different working styles. Dr. Haufmann who was leading a research team mentioned that he needed to spend time guiding doctoral students and considering how to best make appropriate work assignments for the doctoral students. He be lieved that working as a team leader enhanced his management skills, but he had to sacrifice time that could have been used for physics analysis. He commented: The organization of the HEP collaborations creates ample opportunities for physicists to display their intellectual capability, service contribution, and leadership. Workgroups and subgroups in the HEP collaborations are interdependent. People who focus on physics analysis may want to know the hardware and operation of a detector. A subgroup X  X  physics analysis may depend on another subgroup X  X  results. The interdependency between workgroups and subgroups creates the need and the occasion for individual physicists to display th eir contributions in different roles: that of a researcher, a service person, or a team leader in daily work. Thus, the high energy physicists tend to value opportunities for sharing valuable information and for service to the group because this work will contribute to building up their reputation. This contrasts sharply with other fields, where scientists are motivated by produc ing first-authored papers. When researchers focus on first-authored papers, they tend to keep the important information to themselves so that they can retain their competitive edge [5] and are not motivated to contribute service work to the group. The lack of hierarchical management structure in HEP collaborations allows individuals to choose the workgroups where they believe they can make their best contributions. It is not uncommon at research group meetings or big conferences to hear presenters say that they need help in certain areas and invite anybody interested to join. Creativity and love for the work are also accommodated in the HEP collaboration. For example, a researcher working for a U.S. institution devoted part of his research time to creating 3D animation materials for the HEP1 outreach programs, mainly out of his own interest. He enjoyed this work enough to continue it in his spare time and became known for it. Another strength of the interpla y among the reward structure, communitarian culture, and flat management style lies in that it creates potentials for an egalitarian evaluation process. When physicists are evaluated based on their contributions in daily work, this means that everybody has an equal opportunity to show their talents, regardless of thei r seniority or their institutional affiliation. A U.S. postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Peterson, described how Chinese students are diffe rent from other students: She also described how one Chinese student she worked with became visible in one of the highly competitive work groups: Thus, even though they are from less resourced institutions, the Chinese students got noticed because of their hard work and their contribution to the collaboration. Despite opportunities that exist for researchers to display their talents, the degree to which researchers can seize these opportunities is affected by the researchers X  positions in the social structure of science, which is influenced by researchers X  organizational affiliation and their formal training. When physicists first enter the large-scale HEP collaborations we studied, they face information overload. They need to decide which groups to join, what analytical tools they should use, and where and how they can learn about those tools. They must also understand how to efficiently locat e people to get the information they need as well as learn how to navigate the immense labyrinth of collaboration web pages. Researchers who are provided a better orientation to the experime nt, and are not just dropped into a collaboration, are able to start their work more quickly. Different institutions offer new re searchers different levels of orientation, which will be discussed in our next section. Scientists that succeed are separated from those that are lost by their abilities to communicate thei r ideas, demonstrate useful skills, and show their scientific prowess. Junior researchers experience hardship and delays in their professional involvement in work groups when they do not have enough English to express themselves and understand what others are saying and doing. People with very different cultural origins, especially those from strict hierarchical societie s, may have trouble asserting themselves and being aggressi ve enough to promote their own ideas in such a competitive environment. A Korean postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Lee commented: Power struggles in the collaboration also lead to some researcher X  X  ideas being neglected , which will be discussed in our next section. Lee et al. [17] contend that collaboration participants X  home institutions  X  X et the context X  for an individual researcher X  X  participation in large collaborations. Our study finds that researchers are both enabled and constrained by their home institution X  X  incentive structure, funding limitations, and research culture. The large-scale experiments HEP1 and HEP2 are challenging for junior scientists who must dige st mountains of rapidly changing knowledge and information. One Chinese doctoral student, Mr. Ping, gave an example of the challenges he faced: Researchers mentioned that staying at Institute X and belonging to a work group is the most efficient way to access information and experts. If a home institution can afford to fund researchers with different levels of expertise to stay at Institute X, it helps to increase individual researcher X  X  competitiveness and nurture junior scientists X  development. The lead researcher of this study used a U.S. university, University M X  X  office at Institute X as a temporary office when she worked there for three weeks during June and July of 2011. While there, she observed how researchers from University M worked together. For example, tw o doctoral students and a senior faculty member from University M collaborated in a very competitive physics analysis group. The University M group tried to obtain results faster than ot her members. Group members sat in the same cubical area and disc ussed ideas and issues among themselves whenever they needed to do so. Sometimes they divided their work. Once Mr. Lian, a doctoral student, commented,  X  X n these days, I mainly focus on analysis. My adviser works like an information processor. He reads all the email messages related to analysis, filters and digests all the messages. He ga ve me advice on the direction of our analysis based on the information. X  University M X  X  group efforts enhance team and individual competitiveness. However, not every university can afford to have many members stay in Institute X. Senior Chinese researchers and Korean researchers reported that they could only make short visits to Institute X once or twice a year because of their heavy teaching load and their home institution X  X  funding limitations. By contrast, American and Japanese researchers could obtain much more travel funding. Senior researchers from the U.S. and Japan said that they could manage to stay at Institute X for about two weeks every month. Even though senior researchers from the U.S. and Japan had ad ministrative responsibilities at their home institutions, their resear ch focuses mainly on the large HEP experiment in which they ar e participating. In contrast, senior Korean and Chinese researchers reported that they were constantly under pressure to apply for different grants for their own career and to support their doctoral students. It was not uncommon for senior Korean and Chinese researchers to work on several projects at the same time. Also, due to their limited funds, Chinese institutions could not hire postdoctoral fellows to stay at Institute X. It is widely acknowledged in the HEP community that postdoctoral fellows play an important role in physics analysis and training doctoral students because senior researchers tend to spend more time on administrative tasks and doctora l students are not sufficiently experienced. Without postdoctoral fellows and without a research group X  X  presence, Chinese doctoral students cannot enjoy the benefits of the in-house expertise that drive advantageous group effects. The Korean junior researchers also wished they could obtain guidance from experienced Korean researchers. There are several Korean postdoctoral fellows worki ng at Institute X, most new to the large HEP experiments. Some of these postdoctoral fellows previously worked in a smaller scale experiment in Japan. One postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Park X  X  comment showed the Korean researchers X  need for within-group guidance: When asked how her adviser back at her home institution helped her, a Korean doctoral student stated: The strength of group effects also comes from  X  X he history X  of researchers X  home institutions X  participation in the HEP collaborations. A long history of presence in the collaboration results in a better group knowledge of the detector, more experience with the software package for data analysis, more political power, and stronger personal networks. Dr. Park further explained: Researchers X  home institutions also affect researchers X  position in power struggles. The epistemic process in HEP involves  X  X onvoluted tangles X  of different possibilities of  X  X alculating mathematical functions of simulating events that are neither easily calculable nor measurable, and making measurements experimentally X ([15], p77). The pr ocess involves many somewhat subjective decisions, for example, when deciding where to cut a plot. Researchers complained that even though decisions in research should be objective, they felt there were power differentials at work in the decision making process. They felt that some institutions which were i nvolved in the HEP collaborations since the very beginning, contri buted more funds, and worked on important components of a detector , seemed to be more powerful. Dr. Suzuki, a postdoctoral fellow from Japan, talked about his frustrations with the political str uggles. He complained that some of the decisions were  X  X ot scientific. X  He compared his experience of working in an experi ment based in the U.S. with his experience with the HEP1 based in Europe: Similarly, a junior faculty member from a Chinese institution, Dr. An commented: Dr. An went on to explain that there seemed to be prejudice against people from institutions wh ich have a shorter history in the collaborations and that favored colleagues from groups that had been part of Institute X for a longer time. It is also because they have been working together for a long time and their thinking is influenced by each other. Home institution policy and incentive structures affect individual researchers X  contributions to thei r collaborations. As discussed in the previous section, the HEP collaborations require constant service from different institutions to maintain the normal operation of the detector. Offering service work can also increase individual researchers X  visibility. U.S. and Chinese researchers reported how they appreciate Japanese researchers X  service. One Chinese doctoral student told a story of how a Japanese postdoctoral fellow offered to work on a database to clearly record data and the status of data generation. He said that the database had been a mess until th e Japanese postdoctoral fellow offered to rebuild the database. Chinese researchers explained that it was difficult for Chinese doctoral students to offer service work because of the stringent time requirements for their degree and the incentive structure in Chinese institutions. Chinese doc toral students on average have three years to finish their dissertations, which is two years shorter than U.S. doctoral programs. Th e Chinese institutions also ask their doctoral students to display their individual contributions in their dissertations. For example, one Chinese institution required that their doctoral students have a first-authored note and at least a presentation at a significant international conference. These kinds of requirements motivate junior researchers to focus more on physics analysis rather than service work because publications and presentations require results from physics analysis. The senior Chinese scientists reported that one of the biggest challenges they faced is having to battle with th eir home institutions, urging those institutions to consider recognizing professional contributions to the collaborative HEP projects when they design incentive structures. The senior Chinese scientists pointed out that their junior faculty members were frequently behind in the promotion process because they could not show as many first-authored papers as their colleagues in other sub-fields in physics. Personal networks affect how indi vidual researchers participate in collaboration; in an iterative process, collaboration then enables researchers to build and expand their personal networks. Senior researchers X  networks influence which work groups junior researchers will join and how th ey will be oriented to the experiment. Dr. Suzuki, a Japanese postdoctoral fellow, described how he entered the HEP1 Collaboration: Dr. Suzuki X  X  experience is typical for junior researchers. In such large collaborations as HEP1 and HEP2, it is challenging for junior researchers to identify their research focus and select workgroups when they first come to the project. They rely heavily on their senior researchers X  pers onal networks to introduce them to workgroups. They were introduced into a workgroup because their advisers or some professors from their home institutions were associated with or are participating in that workgroup. For institutions that are comparatively new to the HEP1 and HEP2 collaborations and that do not have their own institutional research focus, senior researchers X  personal networks are especially important. Earlier in their careers, some now senior Chinese researchers worked at U.S. and European labs and represented those U.S. or European labs as participants in the HEP collaborations, which enabled them to build their personal networks in the HEP community. Th e senior researchers X  personal networks then became social cap ital for the Chinese institutions. For example, Professor Tian worked at HEP1 and as a researcher at University M in the US for many years, and came to know Professor Anderson from another US university. Later, after Professor Tian returned to China, he was able to introduce his doctoral student Mr. Yu to Professor Anderson. Mr. Yu then worked with a group led by Professor Anderson from a U.S. university. Guided by Professor Anderson, Mr. Yu could gradually identify his own research focus. Professor Tian also introduced Mr. Lin, who was able to work in the University M X  X  group. Even though Chinese institutions could not afford to have their own postdoctoral fellows present at Institute X, some Chinese doctoral graduates found postdoctora l training in the U.S. or in Europe. Their former professors in China then introduced current Chinese doctoral students into the US. or European labs through the Chinese postdoctoral scholars working in those labs. For example, Chinese doctoral student Mr. Ping first worked in a French institute to obtain a joint doctoral degree, but because of the language problem, he could not adjust to the French institute. His adviser introduced him to work in a U.S. lab, to which a Chinese postdoctoral, Dr. Hong, is affiliated. When this study was conducted, Mr. Ping and Dr. Hong work ed together at Institute X. Mr. Ping mentioned that after working with Dr. Hong and his group, he felt that his research was raised to a much higher level. Junior researchers also build their own networks through participation in different workgr oups. As discussed in previous sections, interdependence am ong workgroups and individuals creates the necessity for physicists to communicate in order to exchange information. In the process of communicating and helping each other, they get to know each other. When asked how physicists obtained helpful in formation, Dr. Haufmann, a postdoctoral fellow from Germany, commented: In this comment, Dr. Haufmann emphasized that the layout of the office in Institute X enables junior physicists from various institutions to sit close to each other and to communicate with each other easily. The impact of office layout on physicists X  network building was also reflect ed by the Japanese physicists working for HEP1. The Japanese scientists X  office building was comparatively far from the main administration offices where most of the meetings were held . The Japanese physicists were clustered together in their building and there are not many physicists from other countries work ing there. When interviewed, the Japanese physicists admitted that they felt somewhat isolated and they did not have much chance to talk to people from other countries to improve their English and communication skills. Dr. Hauffman X  X  comments also illu strate that physicists have various channels to communicate with each other: wiki pages, face-to-face meetings, email, etc. Dr. Lee from Korea described his strategy of communicating with people: Communication is not easy for everybody. Traweek [32] described how difficult it is for so me American junior physicists to understand how they could  X  X st ablish, express, and manipulate relationships in networks X  th rough communication. The language barrier and the hierarchical culture of some physicists X  home countries may create additional barriers for them to participate in large-scale collaborations. A junior faculty member from a Japanese institution, Dr. Yamata remembered his experiences when he first joined the collaboration: Realizing the importance of communication skills and developing personal networks, senior Chinese physicists commented that it is important to train their student s in good communication technique and  X  X ow to work with people. X  Th e lead researcher of the current study observed that in some Chinese institutions, senior physicists started to require their students pr esent and discuss their work in English at local research meetings even when there was no foreigner present. One senior physicist told the researcher that she also encouraged her students to pa rticipate in student association activities to develop their interpersonal abilities. heterogeneous efforts by many sc ientists from all over the world. However, scientific collaboration cannot reap its full benefit if individual scientists are constr ained by non-scientific social parameters such as institutional and funding policies, power struggles, and scientists X  lack of communication and collaboration skills. In this paper, we adopt the concept of human infrastructure as our analytic lens to examine two high energy physics collaborations. Concentrating on human infrastructure allows us to see how specific components of basic social structures facilitate or impede individual scientists X  participation in international collaboration. While previous literature tends to focus on the macro level of analysis, the management and coordination within virtual organizations, our study concentrates on individual scientists, especially junior scientists  X  gains and challenges when participating in international collaboration. Scientists have multiple affiliations, which means we must analyze the impact of and interaction between diffe rent components of human infrastructure. Our human infrastructure analysis goes beyond the virtual organizations and includes scientists X  home institutions and personal networks. In this way, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of what enhances or impedes scientists X  participation in inte rnational collaboration. Identifying the mechanisms that constrain sc ientists enables us to build human infrastructure that facilitates individual scientists X  participation in collaboration. In order to ensure the best outcomes from international collaboration, it is important for individual participants to produce their best efforts [2]. The be st efforts aim to both maximize individual productivity to help scientists gain professional credit for hiring and promotion, and to augment individual X  X  contribution to collaborations. The HEP community X  X  reward structure, along with its commun itarian epistemic culture and effective non-hierarchical management, enable individual participants to be productive, collaborative, and contributive. However, individuals X  positions in th e social structure affect their participation in collaboration. Our study reveals that scientists from lesser-resourced institutions ar e placed in a disadvantageous position in collaboration, which is counter to the hypothesis that distributed scientific collaboration will result in more equal participation in science [10]. Even though the HEP community values individuals X  reputation ove r of publications and citations, some researchers X  home institutions X  reward structure does not match the HEP reward structure. Thus, scientists from institutions whose reward structures do not match HEP X  X  must still struggle for individual productivity and are reluctant to do service work, which the HEP community values . Lesser resourced institutions cannot afford strong home institutions X  team presence at the physical center of the virtual orga nization, which hinders junior scientists from gaining better a nd more timely guidance; lesser resourced institutions cannot provide the home institution X  X  teamwork, which decreases individuals X  competitiveness. In long-term collaborations like the two HEP collaborations we studied, having an historic institutional presence enhances individual scientists X  political power. Lesser resourced institutions usually do not have long history of presence. Thus, in order to ensure that scientists can be both productive and contributive, scientists X  home in stitutions should set up incentive policy that values essential cont ributions to collaborative work, even if that work might not result in individual products. Home institutions must appreciate the importance of establishing a home team presence in virtual collaborations and work to create their own teams or establish team rela tionships with other institutions. Funding agencies should provide su fficient funds for scientists and trainees to travel and be present at the physical center for collaboration. Funding agencies should also allow scientists to concentrate their efforts on fewer projects, avoiding the dilution of effort into less effective frac tions. This trend has begun in U.S. institutions, some of which have now allotted an extra year for collaborative researchers to build their research and publication resources when applying for tenure [33]. There are also discussions in U.S. institutions of assigning proper credit to tenure candidates whose scholarship yields multiple collaborative authorships; alternative measures of academic achievement are being explored [11]. It will also be helpful for individual institutions to provide researchers systematic training on specific collaboration skills. Joint institutes between lesser resourced and well resourced institutions allow scientists to overcome their home institutions X  limitations. Joint institutes enable j unior scientists to develop their personal networks early in their careers. Joint institutes provide junior researchers from less res ourced countries more guidance and also offer them a home base at the physical center of the virtual organization. Administrative and management e fforts from virtual organizations that facilitate large-scale colla borations can help scientists overcome their home institutions X  constraints. We found that the management structure that lacks hierarchical control enables scientists to choose their workgroups, manage and organize their own time and effort, volunteer to work in the area they are interested in, and provides ample opportunities for junior researchers to learn from other HEP community members. However, we also found that junior researchers felt overwhelmed and disoriented when they first came to the collaboration. Thus, virtual organizations should provide basic but systematic orientation for the junior researchers in order to save their precious time and effort and allow them to be productive more quickly. For example, virtual organizations like the HEP1 and HEP2 Experiments could provide face-to-face training, distance education or online materials regarding the organizational structure of different workgroups as well as providing in-person workshops on communication and interpersonal skills. Virtual organizations could also produce a repository of digital stories [20], where scientists talk about their own experiences of working in a large collaboration and how they met the challenges they faced when they first arrived.
