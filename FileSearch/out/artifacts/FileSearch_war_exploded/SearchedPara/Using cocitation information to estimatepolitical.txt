 REGULAR PAPER Miles Efron Abstract This paper introduces a simple method for estimating cultural orienta-tion, the affiliation of online entities in a polarized field of discourse. In particular, cocitation information is used to estimate the political orientation of hypertext documents. A type of cultural orientation, the political orientation of a document is the degree to which it participates in traditionally left-or right-wing beliefs. Es-timating documents X  political orientation is of interest for personalized informa-tion retrieval and recommender systems. In its application to politics, the method uses a simple probabilistic model to estimate the strength of association between a document and left-and right-wing communities. The model estimates the like-lihood of cocitation between a document of interest and a small number of docu-ments of known orientation. The model is tested on three sets of data, 695 partisan web documents, 162 political weblogs, and 198 nonpartisan documents. Accuracy above 90% is obtained from the cocitation model, outperforming lexically based classifiers at statistically significant levels.

Often impassioned and partisan, author-maintained weblogs remind us of the importance of opinion and sentiment in the filtering task. According to the website blogstreet.com , 1 Cut on the Bias 2 and Liberal Oasis 3 are both popular blogs about politics. Yet their perspectives on the same political subjects are at odds. The home page of Liberal Oasis reads,  X  X here the Left is Right and the Right is Wrong.

 iations of documents in a polarized field of discourse. To motivate the technique, this paper explores the political orientation (left-or right-leaning) of web docu-ments. The focus is on politics because political orientation is a particularly salient dimension of author and reader opinion in the weblog domain, an increasingly im-portant area of retrieval. The internet portal Yahoo!, for example, classifies blogs into 18 categories, of which politics is the largest, a count which does not include separately listed blogs devoted to the current war in Iraq (so-called war blogs). The marriage of politics and weblogs has surfaced most visibly in the 2004 US presidential election. Led by the Democratic candidate Howard Dean, the major campaigns this year all used blogs to disseminate political opinion [ 21 ]. by adopting a social metaphor. The model explicated here is based on previous work by Turney and Littman [ 24 ], which follows Firth X  X  notion that we may learn the meaning of a word  X  X y the company it keeps X  [ 11 ]. Likewise, we may use hyperlink structure to learn about a document on the Internet [ 1 , 6 , 12 ]. This paper takes Firth X  X  metaphor literally. The proposed estimator gauges an object X  X  cultural orientation by noting which documents it tends to be cocited with. Beginning with a core of exemplar documents, the estimator uses AltaVista X  X  4 link : command to create an odds ratio that approximates the target entity X  X  cultural orientation. tion systems. Additionally, this section defines the notions of political orientation and the broader idea of cultural orientation. In Sect. 2.1 Turney and Littman X  X  pointwise mutual information from information retrieval (PMI-IR) algorithm is reviewed, along with the details of its adaptation for measuring political opin-ion in documents. To evaluate the success of the proposed estimator of political orientation, Sect. 4 reports the results of three experiments, one using traditional web documents, another explicitly concerned with weblogs, and a third analyz-ing nonpartisan documents. Finally, Sects. 5 and 6 reflect on the performance and limitations of the proposed method. 2 Background Although it has long been known that relevance is a multidimensional construct [ 20 , 22 ], recent developments in the literature suggest that techniques for address-ing aspects of relevance aside from topicality are gaining new favor in IR research. In particular, a large body of recent work is concerned with so-called opinion min-ing. Opinion mining classifies documents about a given topic with respect to their opinion on that subject. Thus Dave et al. [ 9 ] and Turney [ 23 ] use product reviews to construct classifiers (using a variety of methods) to detect statements of posi-tive or negative sentiment about a given item. These efforts have achieved good results, with classification accuracy above 80% commonly reported. Extending the domain of opinion mining, Pang et al. [ 18 ] used support vector machine clas-sification for movie reviews, achieving 82.9% accuracy. The difficulty in opinion mining and other types of sentiment classification lies in the linguistics of affect. While topicality is often detectable by lexical evidence, nuances of opinion in-volve subtle aspects of discourse and pragmatics. A sentence such as I usually love Sony TVs, but this is not their best effort contains emphatically  X  X ositive X  words. But they are qualified in ways that complicate the classification problem. 2.1 PMI-IR for opinion mining The current work is based on the PMI-IR algorithm proposed by Turney and Littman [ 24 ]. Their work defines an unsupervised approach to learning the se-mantic orientation of words [ 13 , 26 ]. For a given word w i , the semantic orien-tation SO (w i ) is modeled as a real-valued number. Positive values indicate that the word has positive connotations, while negative values imply bad connotations. To gauge the semantic orientation of a word w i , Turney and Littman estimate the pointwise mutual information between w i and two sets of words negative and positive . These sets are comprised of seven words that exemplify negative and positive sentiment, respectively. As described by Church and Hanks [ 8 ], the pointwise mutual information between two words w i and w j isgivenbyEq.( 1 ): where p (w i ,w j ) is the probability that the words co-occur in a document. The pointwise mutual information between a word and a set of words S is obtained by treating the members of S as an equivalence class when calculating the probabili-ties. Based on Eq. (1), Turney and Littman define SO (w i ) (the semantic orienta-tion of w i based on PMI) by Eq. ( 2 ): where positive and negative are the sets of exemplar words. To estimate the nec-essary probabilities, Turney and Littman use the AltaVista search engine to extract an estimated semantic orientation: where | w i NR p query | is the number of pages returned for the query w i NEAR ( pos 1 OR pos 2 ... OR ... pos | p | ) . Words with a positive  X  S are classified as having positive semantic orientation, and vice versa.
 Littman call the method semantic orientation from pointwise mutual information from information retrieval (SO-PMI-IR). Using this simple algorithm, Turney and Littman report results on a par with the more involved approach described by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, with classification accuracy on a set of 3596 words above 80%.
 algorithm to the problem of opinion mining. Using a document X  X  average  X  S over syntactically tagged two-word phrases as evidence of overall sentiment, Turney reports 84% accuracy for author sentiment in automobile reviews, with slightly lower numbers for other types of products. Thus the PMI-IR approach appears to operate at state of the art levels for opinion mining [ 9 , 18 ]. 3 The idea of cultural orientation Estimating semantic orientation by PMI allows us to approach the linguistics of opinion socially, judging words  X  X y the company they keep X . We can extend the utility of this framework by applying its social metaphor at the document, rather than the term level. This section generalizes Turney and Littman X  X  social metaphor to estimate cultural orientation : the degree to which a given document participates in an identifiable and polarized community of discourse.
 est than partisanship as such. Readers of progressive weblogs, for instance, are unlikely to identify with conservative news media. Cultural orientation applies to domains besides politics, as well. For example, fans of mainstream music such as Britney Spears are unlikely to appreciate the hardcore punk rock of Black Flag. While this paper focuses on political orientation of documents, modeling cultural orientation more generally would be useful for personalized information systems and is feasible under the proposed framework. 3.1 Political orientation defined Political orientation is a type of cultural orientation. The New York Times recently appointed Daniel Okrent as its public editor, charged with advocating on behalf of the paper X  X  readership. To describe his biases Okrent writes,  X  X hen you turn to the paper X  X  designated opinion pages tomorrow, draw a line from the Times X  X  editorials on the left side to William Safire X  X  column on the right: you could place me just about at the halfway point X  [ 17 ]. Okrent alludes to the notion that Ameri-can political opinion spans a spectrum, with liberal thinking commonly associated with the left, and conservatism with the right. The goal of the current work is to locate documents along this continuum, much as Okrent imagines metaphorically. it participates in the ideologies of either the political left or right. Ideally an algo-rithm for estimating political orientation should display several properties:  X  Pages with similar outlooks should receive similar scores.  X  Pages with opposing outlooks should receive inverse scores.  X  Pages that are nonpolitical in their content, or that treat politics in a nonpartisan way should receive neutral scores. With these desires in mind the following section offers a probabilistic framework for estimating cultural orientation based on hyperlink information. 3.2 Cultural orientation from cocitation analysis While some research confronts the linguistics of affect head-on [ 13 , 26 ], other work has looked to nonlinguistic features for use in opinion mining. This turn motivates the current work. Agrawal et al. argue that  X  X he vocabulary used in the two sides of an issue is generally identical, X  a fact that obviously frustrates lexical machine learning [ 1 ]. Thus Agrawal et al. turn to the hyperlink structure between documents in their analysis. Their graph partitioning-based approach to classi-fying positive or negative sentiment yields results superior to most term-based methods, achieving accuracy near 84% for certain topics.
 Eq. (1) we define the pointwise mutual information between citations 5 to d i and to another document d j by Eq. ( 4 ): where p ( d i ) is the probability that a document in the community of interest con-tains a link to d i and p ( d i , d j ) is the probability that documents d i and d j are co-cited X  X hat is to say, the probability that a document in the population contains links to both documents. If the probability of a document d k linking to d i is in-dependent of whether or not it also links to d j then we gain no information by knowing the links of d k ;Eq.( 4 ) yields 0 bits of information. But if documents d i and d j tend to be cited together in the discursive community Eq. ( 4 ) quantifies the information we gain by knowing the links of d k . Equation (4) thus estimates the degree of independence with respect to cocitation between documents.
 to opposing points of view with respect to a given topic T ,thenweestimatethe orientation of d i with respect to T by Eq. ( 5 ): where link: R is the AltaVista command link:r 1 OR link:r 2 ... OR link:r | R | . 6 To avoid division by zero, we follow Turney in adding 0.01 to the first element of the numerator and denominator of Eq. ( 5 ) as a form of Laplace smoothing. 3.3 Probabilistic motivation Let d i be a document whose cultural orientation we wish to estimate, as in the previous section. We begin by assuming that two Bernoulli processes generate all documents on the topic of interest. Each process B k generates documents that contain a hyperlink to documents in the exemplar set K . That is, each process generates documents with a given orientation towards the topic. Finally each dis-tribution B k produces documents that contain a hyperlink to d i with probability p . Using the sign of Eq. (5) as a classifier corresponds with choosing the most likely distribution given the data. Eq. (5) may be rewritten as Eq. ( 6 ): By definition, the numerator of the antilog of Eq. ( 6 ) is the maximum likelihood estimate of p R , the probability of success in the Bernoulli process that generates documents with links to items in the exemplar set R . That is, out of | link : R | draws from B R we observe | link : d i AND li nk : R |  X  X uccesses. X  Likewise, the denomina-tor gives the MLE of p L , the estimated probability of seeing d i co-cited with an exemplar in set L .
 Eq. ( 6 ) approximates a log-odds ratio; it is symmetric around 0. If the probability of seeing a cocitation of d i andanexemplarin R is greater than the probability of a cocitation with a document in L then Eq. ( 6 ) is positive. Conversely, a higher likelihood of cocitation with L gives a negative value for Eq. ( 6 ).
 choosing the class whose underlying distribution is most likely to have generated the document. We thus define the classifier for document d i with respect to topic T by Eq. ( 7 ): Of course our estimator  X   X  could be improved. As an odds ratio, one could derive a confidence interval for  X  using the asymptotic standard error estimate [ 2 ]. Fi-nally, a hypothesis test for the difference between two binomial proportions could be employed. However, in this experiment, neither the confidence interval nor hy-pothesis testing approach improved classification significantly. Thus we retain the point estimate of Eq. ( 5 ). 3.4 Using cocitations to estimate political orientation To estimate the political orientation of a document d i , we begin by defining two sets of exemplar documents left and right . For this study, each set of exemplars was populated with 19 highly partisan documents. A list of these documents appears in Table 1 .
 as DMOZ). 7 Left-leaning documents were chosen by selecting those documents in the Open Directory X  X  category Politics:Liberalism:Social Liberalism that had (according to AltaVista) at least 1000 incoming hyperlinks, on December 7, 2003. Likewise, the set of right-wing exemplars was chosen from Politics:Conservatism . The matter of which documents should be included in these exemplar sets is dis-cussed in Sect. 4.5 .
 leaning paradigms. Pages that are cocited with a preponderance of right-wing doc-uments will score positively, while documents that appear mostly with left-wing material get a score below zero. The stronger these tendencies, the larger the ab-solute value of Eq. ( 5 ) will be. Documents cocited with none of the exemplars will get a constant score reflecting the ratio of in-links for each set of exemplars. If the prior probabilities (i.e. the link counts) of each class are equal, then documents with no partisan cocitations score 0, indicating neutrality.
 spectrum, with neutrality centered at 0, as seen in Table 2 .Table 2 shows a sample of home pages from widely known political websites, locating each URL as a point on the real number line, which approximates the notion of political spectrum. As we would expect The New York Times website falls near the center, but slightly to the left of the more conservative Wall Street Journal . On the other hand, the website of the progressive Green party lies far to the left, at the opposite end of the spectrum from The Heritage Foundation, a think tank known for its right-wing policy recommendations.
 it assumes that hyperlink structures approximate intellectual communities. While this ignores the fact that many links imply disfavor rather than endorsement of their target documents, the success of link-based approaches to data mining sug-gests that this oversimplification introduces relatively little error [ 1 ]. 4 Experimental evaluation To evaluate the suitability of the proposed estimator of political orientation, three experiments were performed. The first experiment tests the approach on a corpus of 695 partisan web documents. In experiment two, analysis was limited to a set of 162 political weblogs. Experiment three analyzes the behavior of the proposed estimator on nonpartisan political documents. 4.1 Web data evaluation A test corpus was constructed based on the web directories provided by Yahoo! 8 and the Open Directory Project (DMOZ). For this experiment all URLs listed in the directories shown in Table 3 were used as test cases. Removing duplicates and any documents that appeared in the left and right training sets left a corpus of 695 documents, each of whose political orientation was ostensibly given by its Yahoo! or DMOZ category.
  X  Cocitations as described in Eq. ( 7 )  X  Naive Bayes: A naive Bayes classifier fitted after removal of stopwords [ 16 ]  X  SVM: a support vector machine classifier trained on the same data as the naive Bayes model [ 7 ]. The SVM used a linear kernel function.
 The word-based classifiers were trained on a corpus of 2412 documents. 9 The training set was built by downloading the first two levels of hypertext from the websites that comprised the exemplars for the cocitation-based estimator. Af-ter initially dismal word-based performance 10 additional websites of each class (chosen from the relevant DMOZ directories) were downloaded in an attempt to mitigate the tendency of the naive Bayes and SVM methods to overfit the training data. A summary of these results appears in Table 4 .
 derived classifications.
 racy on the test data. On the other hand it reached 97.6% accuracy for the right-leaning documents. Part of this asymmetry can be ascribed to the fact that in this experiment, documents that had zero incoming links were assigned to the most likely category ( right ). Alternately, we could assume that such documents must be classified as nonpartisan. Changing the results to reflect this heuristic, yields Ta b l e 7 .
 formulation yields an F -measure of 0.9564, with classification accuracy of 91.65%. Defining zero-linked documents as failures gives classification accuracy of 90.46% for left documents and 92.82% for right documents. Unless otherwise noted the remainder of this study assumes that it is known a priori that all doc-uments are about politics and should be assigned the most probable score in the event of poor link evidence.
 the tested lexical methods. To formalize this, the proportions of correct to incorrect classifications for left-and right-wing documents found under the cocitation-based and SVM methods were compared. Submitting the resultant contingency tables to a standard 2  X  2 chi-square test yielded p &lt; 0 . 001 for both left-and right-leaning documents. Additionally, Table 7 was used to estimate the error rate of the cocitation-based classifier, counting nonclassified documents as errors. A chi-squared test on the error rates for the SVM and this more stringent heuristic also yielded p &lt; 0 . 001.
 ments provides a less noisy source of evidence for opinion detection than do sim-ple lexical features. Interestingly, for these data, using bigrams for term-based classification degraded performance over the unigram model, suggesting that the term-based models are suffering an overfitting effect, which the link-based ap-proach avoids. Due to the evident inferiority of the naive Bayes lexical classifier, the remainder of this paper reports results only from the cocitation-based approach and the SVM model described above. 4.2 Blog data evaluation As a second test, the estimator of Eq. ( 5 ) was evaluated on a set of political blogs. Finding blogs about politics is easy. Unfortunately for our purposes, most blog directories do not subdivide the politics category by partisanship. Because of this the test data for this evaluation was sparse, and a bit skewed. A sample of 119 left-wing blogs was downloaded from Progressive Gold , 10 a self-described pro-gressive blog. The maintainer of Progressive Gold keeps a directory of decidedly left-leaning blogs; these comprised our sample on the left.
 which maintains a directory of right-wing blogs. Unfortunately, Townhall X  X  di-rectory contained only 43 blogs at the time of this writing, and thus our sample is skewed to the left. for these blogs. The method correctly classified all 43 right-wing blogs, and incor-rectly classified only two of the 119 left-slanted blogs. In contrast, the SVM model mis-classified nine right-wing documents and 55 left-wing documents. A chi-squared test on the resultant contingency tables of each method yielded p &lt; 0 . 001 for the left-wing documents and p = 0 . 003 for the right-wing documents. data versus the webpage data described above. Table 8 summarizes the connect-edness of each data set.
 pages. While 3% of the sampled web pages had zero in-links, only 1 of the 162 (0.6%) weblogs had no link information. And although the maximum number of in-links was higher for the plain web pages, the middle quartiles for the blogs were much higher. The hyperlink is the coin of the realm in weblog communities. From a discursive standpoint, blogs operate much like annotated bibliographies, with authors using other authors X  work as foils for their own reflections, citing their sources as they write. Although the small size of this sample leaves the matter open for future investigation, this study suggests that the community of political webloggers is more highly connected than the general domain of political web-sites is. This highly social behavior makes the weblog domain especially ripe for application of the cocitation-based approach to estimating political orientation. 4.3 Performance on nonpartisan documents The high accuracy of the link-based approach discussed in the previous two sec-tions suggests that the political orientation of the test documents might have been extreme. Since the web and blog test documents had been explicitly categorized as partisan, this would come as no surprise. An important question then is: how does our estimator  X   X  perform when presented with documents whose political orienta-tion is less extreme? If Eq. ( 5 ) is in fact estimating each site X  X  political orientation, it should deliver scores closer to 0 for nonpartisan documents than for documents with a clear political bias.
 entation estimate closer to 0 than highly opinionated documents, a corpus of puta-tively nonpartisan documents was constructed. This corpus was built by selecting the contents of the three categories from Yahoo! the Open Directory, shown in Ta b l e 9 . These categories were chosen because they were retrieved by a Google search for the phrase nonpartisan politics , and on inspection they appeared to contain few highly biased documents. Selecting the documents from each of these categories led to a set of N = 198 putatively nonpartisan test documents. cal documents is difficult. Many websites that claim to offer unbiased information do so in efforts to advance a highly politicized agenda. Moreover, the categories listed in Table 9 do not explicitly preclude inclusion of biased documents. Thus the 198 test documents may in fact have a political bias. However, in an admit-tedly subjective sense, most of the documents in these categories appeared to offer unbiased information.
 for the 695 web documents (top panel) and the 198 nonpartisan documents (bot-tom panel). The general web documents appear to be bimodal, with a pronounced peak near 4 (the block of partisan documents scoring near 0 is an artifact of weak cocitation information, as described in the following section). The median abso-lute value of  X   X  for partisan documents was 3.009. On the other hand, the non-partisan documents show a strong tendency to score near 0, with sample median of 0.971. Additionally, the partisan documents show scores extending as high as abs (  X   X ) = 16, while the highest estimates for nonpartisan documents was near 11. It must be admitted that a score of 11 suggests a highly partisan reading for a supposedly nonpartisan document. However, upon inspection, it was noted that this high scoring document was for the pro-choice voter education website vot-ingProChoice , 12 a URL that entered the nonpartisan sample due to the method of gathering data, but which is unlikely to be truly above the partisan fray. san documents yielded p &lt; 0 . 001. This test suggests that the estimator modulated its output when presented with documents whose political orientation was not ex-treme. The significance of this test is especially encouraging since the collection of  X  X onpartisan X  documents may have contained outlier documents that were in fact biased. 4.4 The problem of sparse link data The obvious shortcoming of the proposed use of cocitation information in estimat-ing political orientation lies in the problem of sparse link data. If a given document d has zero incoming links, the proposed approach has no evidence with which to make an estimate. Even if a document has some incoming links, if none of those entails a cocitation with an exemplar, the algorithm remains at a loss. This prob-lem is exacerbated by the instability of the log-odds ratio when class counts sink below approximately 4.
 AltaVista offered no incoming links. More vexing, there were 137 documents that contained fewer than four cocitations with any of exemplar documents. Counting these documents as errors leads to a significant degradation in classifier perfor-mance, as noted in Table 10 .
 classification accuracy for left-wing documents and 69% accuracy for right-wing documents. From Table 6 we calculate the SVM X  X  accuracy as 69% for left-wing documents and 76% for right-wing documents. The differences between the two methods X  classification accuracy are not statistically significant under this definition.
 posed approach, it bears mentioning that only a small amount of link information is needed to achieve good classification. For instance, of the 695 test documents, 80% (558 documents) showed at least 4 cocitations with exemplar documents. For these documents, the proposed method correctly classified 539, for an accuracy of 96.6%. Thus even a small amount of link data appears to be sufficient for the technique to deliver good estimates.
 against the margin of accuracy achieved by the proposed technique. That is, the y -axis is the magnitude of a URL X  X  score, transformed such that positive values indicate a correct classification, while negative values show the margin of error. errors at in-link = 0), websites with low in-link counts do not appear to lead to egregious errors; instead, the errors toward the left of the plot are all small. The largest errors lie near the middle of the plot, where the majority of URLs are found, suggesting that such outliers are due to factors other than a paucity of data. The correlation between the absolute value of the political orientation estimate and the number of incoming links was only 0.026.
 blog data. Not only did weblogs contain more in-links on average than the general web documents, they also offered richer cocitation patterns with exemplar doc-uments. While 137 (20%) of the 695 general web documents were cocited with fewer than four exemplar documents, only two (1.2%) of the 162 tested blogs pro-vided untenable cocitation information. With p &lt; 0 . 01 we conclude that blogs tend to have higher cocitation with the exemplars than non-blog political web pages. Thus sparse cocitation information appears to be less troublesome for blog data than for political web pages in general. 4.5 Items in exemplar sets An open question in the application of PMI-IR for concept learning in general (whether for semantic or cultural orientation of words or documents) is which items should comprise the paradigms. To motivate this choice for the experiments reported here, documents in intuitively relevant DMOZ directories that showed at least 1000 incoming links were selected. This led to the paradigms shown in Ta b l e 1 . However, the selection of 1000 in-links was arbitrary. Turney and Littman use only seven exemplars in their learning paradigms, but for this study it was con-jectured that the link-based approach would suffer from poor performance without sufficient exemplar data.
 using fewer exemplar documents. Let M full be the 19-exemplar per-class model described above. Based on this, simpler models were constructed: M 7 and M 2 , which contain the most highly linked seven and two exemplars for each class, re-spectively. Table 11 shows classification performance for the webpage data under each of the models.
 to the larger models. However, the distinction between the 19-exemplar and 7-exemplar models is negligible. A chi-square test on each model X  X  error rate yielded p = 0 . 806, suggesting that they are statistically indistinguishable. For the data presented here, then, no more information is required for the cocitation-based clas-sifier than was used in Turney and Littman X  X  SO-PMI-IR study. 4.6 Estimator stability over time Although websites (especially blogs) are dynamic, it may be expected that an estimator of a site X  X  political orientation should remain relatively stable over time. Except for those sites that are nonpartisan, or whose partisanship changes, most left-leaning resources retain progressive sympathies, while right-leaning sites tend to remain conservative over time. Because the estimator proposed in this paper relies on information that is external to a given resource, this section undertakes an analysis of the estimator X  X  behavior over time.
 These blogs were acquired by issuing the queries politics and Iraq and politics and economy to the blog search engine Daypop . 13 The sample consists of 250 blogs (125 of each estimated political orientation) drawn from the first 1000 documents that Daypop returned for these queries. Following the initial identification of this sample, the political orientation of each blog was measured weekly, for 17 weeks. It should be noted that this period included the US Presidential election. though several blogs X  estimated political orientation changed significantly over the four months, the majority changed very little. The mean of the difference between each site X  X   X   X  at week 1 and at week 17 was 0.147. A 95% confidence interval on  X   X  the estimates of the blogs X  political orientation did not change significantly. variation, as seen in Fig. 4 . This figure shows the estimated cultural orientation for two documents at each week X  X  interval. The two documents are the blogs with median estimated cultural orientation on both the left and right. Both of these blogs show a very steady reading until approximately week 10, at which point they become less stable. Though it is not possible to ascribe a cause to this, it is worth noting that this period of time coincided with the 2004 US Presidential election, a period of high activity for political bloggers.
 that had been classified as right-leaning at week one, three had changed to left-leaning classifications by week 17. Of the initial 125 left-leaning blogs, five switched direction at the end of 17 weeks. Details for these blogs appear in Ta b l e 12 .
 suffer from weak link information, as described above. This result demonstrates the skepticism that must accompany analysis of weakly linked resources by the methods proposed in this paper. Because the log-odds ratio is unstable on sparse data, the need for additional sources of evidence in classifying documents with respect to cultural orientation seems especially acute.
 evidence. In particular, windBlog 14 and hurryUpHarry 15 appear to have roughly equal proportions of readers on both the left and right, as shown in Fig. 5 . With respect to link evidence, these blogs stay closely to the political center, a phe-nomenon that is notable in this sample due largely to its rarity. 5 Discussion Using hyperlinks to infer communal relationships among documents is a rela-tively familiar and well-developed practice [ 3 , 5 , 6 , 15 , 25 ]. Gibson et al. [ 12 ] demonstrate the utility of such an approach to identifying discrete communities online. The imperative for IR to account for the communal behavior that is latent in hypertext is felt all the more keenly today, when, as Howard Rheingold argues, current technologies enable people to approach information seeking as a social problem [ 19 ]. The popularity of highly interlinked weblogs exemplifies this trend, as does the advent of social network-based applications such as Friendster 16 and Meetup.com , 17 all of which have attained significance in the context of contempo-rary political discourse [ 10 , 21 ].
 nomenon, as opposed to a linguistic one. The failure of word-based classifiers to discriminate accurately between left-and right-leaning documents reinforces the intuitive notion that political orientation (like other facets of semantic affect) is communicated largely at linguistic levels above the lexicon. Unigram naive Bayes and SVM classifiers failed to discriminate adequately for these data because both liberal and conservative documents use largely the same vocabulary.
 ical and other sources of evidence for estimating cultural orientation. The frame-work provided by Beineke et al. [ 4 ] makes such an extension to the proposed model both feasible and well motivated.
 ple model of community appears to suffice for the purposes of document classifi-cation according to political orientation. As noted in Sect. 4.5 ,asimple7-exemplar per-class paradigm led to 93% classification accuracy for the web data sampled here. This model obviously oversimplifies political opinion, ignoring legions of viable exemplars, not to mention other sources of evidence besides cocitation. proach to the complexity of link semantics. Central to the technique pursued here is the notion that cocitation implies similarity. However, it is the case that many authors create hyperlinks during the course of criticism, rather than endorsement. Such patterns would introduce noise to the orientation estimates. However, the re-sults reported here suggest that such errors are either not numerous, or otherwise offset by more conventional link semantics.
 alization and recommender systems. In particular, this work anticipates the prob-lem of supporting personalized information discovery in the weblog domain. In the highly opinionated discourse of blogs, filtering documents by political orien-tation would provide an important service. Likewise, the method could be applied to recommender systems, so that services such as online booksellers could more accurately gauge the tastes of their customers. At the risk of encouraging ideo-logical insulation, the technique described here could derive political orientation scores for customers and authors, in efforts to satisfy user needs more effectively. In future work, the method will be extended to allow users to create their own sets of exemplar documents based on different areas of interest. This type of ad hoc personalization by hyperlink analysis was anticipated in Haveliwala X  X  work on topic-sensitive PageRank [ 14 ]. As the name implies, however, Haveliwala X  X  modification of the PageRank algorithm is inherently topical. As such it addresses a different type of personalization than the method pursued here.
 about politics. Missing from this discussion is a consideration of how the pro-posed technique would fare when confronted with documents about, say, cars or travel. However, lexical methods have proven adept at such topical classification. Thus this omission is justified insofar as we may assume that routing political documents to the cultural orientation estimator could be handled by conventional methods. Perhaps more problematic is the matter of the method X  X  performance on documents with moderate political views. The analysis of Sect. 4.3 yielded en-couraging but preliminary results. The task remains of estimating the algorithm X  X  error rate on moderate documents. 6Conclusion This study used hyperlink cocitations to estimate the political orientation of doc-uments. Based on the work of Turney and Littman, the work extends the notion of pointwise mutual information between words and concepts, to derive a mea-sure of association between documents and concepts. In this study, the concepts of interest were left-versus right-wing political orientation.
 ing statistically significant improvement over unigram-based applications of both naive Bayes and SVM classifiers.
 coming link data. However, although this effect was significant, the proposed tech-nique was able to classify correctly many documents with low in-link counts. Likewise, the technique appears robust against reductions in model complexity, a quality that may lead to improved performance by recourse to alternate methods of exemplar selection.
