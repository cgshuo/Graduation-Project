 This study uses regression mode ling to predict a user X  X  domain knowledge level (DK) from implicit evidence provided by certain search behaviors. A user study (n=35) with recall-oriented search tasks in the genomic domain was conducted.. A number of regression models of a person X  s DK, were generated using different behavior variable sel ection methods. The best model highlights three behavior variab les as DK predictors: the number of documents saved, the average query length, and the average ranking position of documents opene d. The model is validated using the split sampling method. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

User modeling, domain knowledge modeling, domain knowledge prediction, information retrieval, user studies Users of information retrieval (IR ) systems have varying degrees of domain knowledge (DK). DK has been found to affect user search tactics and search performance [2], [5]. Automated prediction of DK is desirable and at least one algorithm has been reported using search log data to make binary classifiers (high or low DK) (White et. al. [4]). The current study develops a regression model for user DK from a rich data set of user behaviors collected in a controlled study. These behaviors are observable in computer interacti on logs as they involve query properties, SERP link behavior and document use. Such behavior-based models can predict the us er's DK level and permit systems to be personalized by adapting to the user's knowledge level. We treat DK as a continuous dependent variable to be predicted from distinct types of search behavi ors and use multivariate regression modeling. Different variable sel ection methods are used to build alternative models for comparison. An IR system was implemented using the Indri search engine from the Lemur toolkit. The data set was the 2000-2004 portion of Three categories of search behaviors are considered in this study: querying behaviors; document sel ection/viewing behaviors, and the general task interaction beha viors, such as the number of actions per task, task completion time, and so on. More than 15 behavior variables were analyzed in this study. The user experiment was conducte d in the work-task framework proposed by Borlund [1]. The participants were asked to rate the selected portion of MeSH terms fi rst. Then they would complete the pre-task questionnaire, wh ich was followed by conducting searches on the experimental system. Tasks were systematically-rotated in balanced blocks. Pa rticipants saved documents during the search and evaluated their level of relevance after completing the search. After evaluation of the documents for the search task, a post-task questionnaire was admi nistered. The experiment was conducted in a human-computer interaction lab, and each participant was tested individually. The participant-system interaction was logged by computer software. The collected user behavior data was analyzed using multiple regression analysis [3]. The generic multiple regression model is expressed as: where y is the predicted value of the dependent variable, a the variables. Both a and b 1 ...b k must be determined from the sample population data. To predict DK from search behavior variables, we can use DK as research question is to identif y the collection of behavior variables that do the best job of predicting the calculated task DK of the participants. There are over 15 behavior variables involved in the study. We evaluated the meaningfulness of the variables used in the regression analysis using Pears on correlation analysis. First we looked at the relationship between these behavior variables and DK on the data set aggregated for all participants and all tasks. Eight significant behavior variable s were identified (Table 3) and they were used as the candida te predictors in the multiple regression analysis. Several standard techniques exis t for selection of the most discriminative variables to include in a multiple regression model [3]. Using all candidate variables generated in 3.1, the stepwise estimation method and the backwa rd elimination method were employed in analysis. In addition, we generated a model using all of the candidate variables as a standard for model comparison. combinations of predictors.
