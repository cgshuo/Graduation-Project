 The information needs of users and the documents which answer it are frequently contingent on the di ff erent charac-teristics of users. This is especially evident during natural disasters, such as earthquakes and violent weather incidents, which create a strong transient information need. In this paper we investigate how the information need of users is a ff ected by their physical detachment, as estimated by their physical location in relation to that of the event, and by their social detachment, as quantified by the number of their ac-quaintances who may be a ff ected by the event. Drawing on large-scale data from three major events, we show that social and physical detachment levels of users are a major influence on their information needs, as manifested by their search en-gine queries. We demonstrate how knowing social and phys-ical detachment levels can assist in improving retrieval for two applications: identifying search queries related to events and ranking results in response to event-related queries. We find that the average precision in identifying relevant search queries improves by approximately 18%, and that the aver-age precision of ranking that uses detachment information improves by 10%.

In today X  X  world, people are ever more informed of news events that take place far from their homes, very shortly after events occur. This is especially true of events which are limited in time and location. The information about these events comes from diverse sources, including media outlets (e.g. television, newspapers, media sites on the web), social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook), and active seeking of information using web search engines. Their knowledge of the event and its di ff erent facets is shaped by external forces (which items are reported by news channels they choose to watch) as much as by their preference for information.
As a motivating example, consider an earthquake event, its di ff erent information aspects, and how these might be consumed by users. People close to the event might be in-terested in emergency services and evacuation procedures. People far from the earthquake may want to know more general details of the earthquake and how they might help people a ff ected by it. Finally, people not in the vicinity of the event, but that have friends or relatives which they think may be a ff ected might seek the names of those injured by the earthquake.

News coverage, which may reflect people X  X  interest in an event, is known to be influenced by the physical distance of consumers from the location of the event. As Chang et al. [10] showed, the distance of an event from the USA is one of the most predictive attributes for its media coverage. Fur-thermore, Wu [30] showed that the volume of media related to news events in Canada and Mexico by USA-based news channels is partially explained by the distance of the events from the closest USA border.

However, while news coverage measures information pro-duction with respect to an event, we are interested in more directly measuring people X  X  information demand with re-spect to an event. Consider the graphs 1 of news coverage, so-cial media coverage, and information seeking for three news events in Figure 1. Although the trends, in general, correlate with each other for a given event, the information-seeking behavior of users is su ffi ciently di ff erent from that of media output to motivate a deeper study of information seeking in isolation.

In this paper, we investigate the information need of in-dividuals in response to special events, both adverse and otherwise, as manifested by active information seeking on the web. We investigate this need as a function of users X  re-lationship to the event, specifically their social detachment
Details of the events and the data are given in Section 4. events. These graphs are best printed in color. from the event and their geographic distance from it. We show that information need is strongly dependent on social and geographical attachment. We demonstrate that knowl-edge of social and geographic information can improve re-trieval by accurately identifying queries related to an event and consequently retrieving the appropriate documents.
The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we survey relevant related work. In Section 3 we enhance a previously-proposed model of information need to account for user char-acteristics. Section 4 introduces the data we analyzed. In Section 5 we present an analysis of our data and demon-strate the e ff ect of social and geographic detachment levels on information need. Finally, Section 6 demonstrates two information-retrieval applications which benefit from the use of social and geographic detachment.
Information seeking with respect to news events is gaining increasing attention from the scientific community. Within this area, our work focuses on analyzing the influence of the geographic and social context of the user on querying behavior during an event.

The geographic context of the user has repeatedly been found to have an influence on querying behavior. For ex-ample, almost immediate detection of earthquakes in Japan can be performed with very high confidence by tracking the micro-blogging service Twitter [27]. In fact, a service based on Twitter sent alerts within 20 seconds of the events, com-pared to 6 minutes by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Earthquakes could also be localized by considering the prop-agation time of earthquakes and the reported location of users. Similarly, Backstrom et al. [1] developed a model for pinpointing events based on the location of people query-ing about them. In this way, both stationary terms (sports teams) and moving events (hurricanes) were pinpointed to within a few kilometers. In both [1] and [27] it was found that the closer people are to an event, the more likely they are to seek information about the event or to report about it. In the context of aggregated search, geographic features of the user as well as those mentioned in the query have been found to be very predictive of user interest in news [15]. Similarly, Hassan et al. also found that these geographic features improved general web search [17].

The social context of the user has received somewhat less treatment than geography. Carmel et al. [8] demonstrated that, in an intra-organizational setting, the fact that two people are familiar with each other can improve the sugges-tion of interesting content by serving one person the content which his colleague has marked as interesting. However, that study also concluded that suggesting similar content to simi-lar people can obtain even better results, which may suggest homophily, rather than social connection, is the source of improvement. Teevan et al. found that personalizing at the group scale improved e ff ectiveness for group-related queries [28]. The size of a population which can obtain knowledge of an event through their social network has been studied us-ing both empirical data and theoretic models in [5] and [4]. For example, [5] estimated that between one in 17 and one in 140 people knew a person who was directly influenced by the attacks against the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001. Information propagation in electronic social networks in re-sponse to a crisis event was studied in [24], where it was shown how students utilized social media to form collec-tive response decisions in response to a shooting incident at Virginia Tech university. We note that our study does not analyze the question of which information is passed via the social network. Instead, given a social network and the loca-tion of people, we study which information is of interest to them. In a recent paper, Mendoza et al. [20] analyzed the information published and disseminated by users of Twitter during an earthquake in Chile. Their analysis demonstrated that while both rumors and facts related to the earthquake were disseminated, rumors tended to be questioned by users more than facts, which suggests the community filters false information to some extent. Although it is a single event, information regarding the earthquake was disseminated for at least nine days, much longer than observed for many news stories in the public media (as discussed above).
The temporal analysis of news events also received some attention. For example, Leskovec et al. showed that me-dia interest in an event peaks within two days and decays somewhat quicker than it arises [18]. Social media outlets have a similar attention timespan, and peak, on average, 2.5 hours later than mainstream media. In the context of aggre-gated news search, Diaz found X  X omewhat unsurprisingly X  that temporally local variables such as query volume were important in detecting the newsworthiness of a query [11]. In the context of web ranking, researchers have found that a general retrieval model fails for late-breaking news events and specialized query treatment was required to satisfy user intent [12]. This specialized ranker can be further improved by analyzing the discussion of the topic in social media [13].
Define the primal information object as a topic, T  X  T , which is information pertinent to a defined subject. Each topic is comprised of two sets: the set of queries users may issue when seeking information about that topic, Q T , and the set of documents which may satisfy users seeking infor-mation about that topic, R T . Each topic may be partitioned into aspects { a i }  X  T, i =1 , 2 ,...N , which describe di ff er-ent facets of the topic. Thus, a user may be interested in one or more of a topic X  X  aspects.

Given a user, u , we claim that P ( T | u ), i.e. the proba-bility of the user X  X  interest in T , and the specific aspects a i of T which will be of interest to u depend heavily on di ff erent properties of u ,e.g. P ( a i | u ). These properties in-clude a users X  demographic information (age, gender, etc), social parameters (circle of friends, acquaintances, and work associates), geographic parameters (location vis-a-vis topic location), as well as other parameters (for example, time of day, exposure to di ff erent media, etc).

In this paper we are concerned with two main attributes of users: Their location and social parameters. Specifically, the first property we investigate is d geo ( u, T ), which is the geographic distance between the user and epicenter of the event. We term this property the geographic detachment of a user from an event. We hypothesize that P ( T | u )is negatively correlated with d geo ( u, T ).

The second property we investigate is a soc ( u, T ), which is the social a ffi nity between the user and those users ge-ographically close to the epicenter of an event. We term this property social attachment. A simple way of thinking about social a ffi nity is as the number of friends or family close to the event epicenter. We hypothesize that P ( T | u )is positively correlated with a soc ( u, T ).

Note that both geographic distance and social a ffi nity can-not be defined for every topic. However, for any event which has a clear geographic epicenter these detachment levels can be defined and measured.
In this paper we analyze three events, which are briefly described below: 1. San Bruno event : On September 9th, 2010, at 6:11pm 2. New York storm : A violent storm passed through 3. Alaska elections : The elections to the USA Senate
These events were chosen because they were physically localized in their scope and thus have a clear epicenter. Therefore, social and physical detachment are clearly de-fined for these events. Furthermore, because they are tem-porally limited, they act as an impulse to the system, and thus create high levels of interest for a relatively short and clearly-defined period.

We determined a radius of influence for each event based on the radius of the community a ff ected. In the case of San Bruno, this was set to 5km, which is roughly the area directly disrupted by the explosion. In New York, we set this radius to 30km, to include all the neighborhoods hit by the storm. The radius for Alaska was set to 500km, to include most of Alaska X  X  population, but not any other state.
We used two types of data in our study: First, we ex-tracted query-log data of the Yahoo search engine from sev-eral days before the event (one day for the first two events, and 10 for the last), until 8 days after the event. For each query we extracted its text, time, a unique identifier of the user who posted it, the results displayed to the user, and the pages he or she selected to view as a result of the query.
The query log was parsed to identify those queries which were likely relevant to the event, using a term-matching scheme. We did this by manually generating a list of key-words for each event. The keywords were drawn from several categories: where the event took place, who was involved in the event, and what happened at the event. We also gener-ated a list of excluded words, to remove irrelevant queries. Queries and keywords were stemmed using a Porter stem-mer. A query was considered relevant to the event if key-words from at least two categories were used in the query, and none of the excluded words appearing in it. For exam-ple, the list of keywords for the New York event were: 1. Descriptions : Tornado, Storm 2. Location : New York, NY, NYC, Flushing, Queens, We encode data at the granularity of a day in order to re-move diurnal e ff ects.

Each user was represented by two measures of separa-tion from the event: A physical separation, measured by his physical distance, where a larger distance indicates a larger separation, and a social separation, measured by the num-ber of contacts local to the event, where a larger number indicates smaller separation.

We used the zip-code given by users at the time of regis-tration with Yahoo to identify their approximate location. An alternative way to determine location could have been San Bruno 194,184 45,843 79,134 New York 54,678 4,406 34,069 Alaska 281,851 23,921 183,258
Table 1: Query log statistics for the three events through users X  IP address, but as some users use proxy servers, it is not clear that this would be a superior way of measuring location. We computed the physical distance of each user to the event using the Haversine formula. Finally, we used the list of contacts in the Yahoo Instant Messenger (IM) application as a proxy for users X  social net-work. The number of contacts per person is power-law dis-tributed (  X  =  X  0 . 99, R 2 =0 . 93), with a median of 6 con-nections per person and an average of 22.7 connections 2 . The list of contacts was used to determine the number of contacts each user had in the area of the event, which are defined as the number of contacts inside the radius of in-fluence of each event. Thus, each query is described by a tuple of its text, time and date, and the physical and social separation of the user who posted it from the event. Table 4.2 provides statistics on the number of queries related to each event which were posted during the days we observed the query log, the number of unique relevant queries, and the number of users which posted these queries.

We quantified the daily media volume of news outlets re-lated to an event by counting the number of document found on Yahoo News 3 every day, which contained all the words used in any of the 50 most popular queries identified in Sec-tion 4. Similarly, the volume of social media was measured via the number of Twitter messages which contained the words used in these queries.
We begin our analysis by showing how the probability of a user X  X  interest in topics related to the event of inter-est depend on his geographic and social a ffi nity, that is, we measure P ( T | u ).

Recall that we are interested in examining the relation-ship between P ( T | u ) and our detachment measures. In our analysis we binned users into logarithmically spaced bins ac-cording to their geographic detachment from the event, and used the raw social detachment values. Let U d geo be the set of users within a distance d geo  X   X  of the event; simi-larly for social a ffi nity. We then, for geographic distance, computed the correlation with P ( T |U d geo ), the probability of group interest in T ; similarly for social a ffi nity. We define
Note that users who were not using the IM application had, by definition, zero connections. Therefore, the average and median number of connections is higher than what would have been obtained using the entire population news.yahoo.com this precisely as, Figure 2 shows P ( T |U d geo ) related to the San Bruno event as a function of d geo and as a function of a soc . These fig-ures show that interest is correlated with physical and social a ffi nity. Indeed, the fraction of event-related queries decays exponentially as physical detachment weakens, and linearly so in the case of social a ffi nity.

Table 2 shows the correlations between d geo with P ( T |U for all three events; similarly for social a ffi nity. Additionally, this table shows the polyserial correlation[14] between the log-transformed physical distance and the number of local contacts 4 . The correlation of the two detachment methods is significant, but not very high. This is to be expected, since people closer to an event can be expected to have more lo-cal relationships. While both physical detachment and social a ffi nity are significantly correlated with the fraction of event-related queries, physical detachment seems to be a stronger indicator for interest compared to social a ffi nity. This is in line with several studies (for example, [23]) who have found that social attributes are secondary in importance to indi-vidual traits. Thus, we conclude that the probability that a user will be interested in an event-related topic is highly correlated with social and geographic detachment.
The events we analyzed are characterized by a strong temporally-limited interest of users. Figure 3 shows the frac-tion of queries related to the San bruno event as a function of time, partitioned according to the physical distance of users from the event. Day zero marks the day of the ex-plosion. Since the explosion happened in the early hours of the evening, significant interest in the event starts on day 1 and peaks only on day 2. Interest in the event decays rapidly, and could have been faster if not for a spike on day 5, which is likely related to new findings about the event be-ing reported in the media (The New York and Alaska events decay after approximately three days, as seen in Figure 1). Strikingly, as the figure shows, interest in the San Bruno event decays in an identical manner for users independent of whether they were physically close to the event or far from it ( R 2 =0 . 95 between the two time series), though a logical hypothesis would have been that closer users would retain interest in the event for a longer time period. A similar im-age appears when considering users with no local contacts versus those with many such contacts.
The fact that users post queries related to an event is, as we demonstrated above, significantly tied to their detach-ment from that event. However, queries may have been due to di ff erent aspects of the topic. Indeed, our hypothesis is that the distribution of aspects is dependent on users X  rela-tionship to the event. In this section we identify di ff erent aspects of the event-related topics and show how di ff erences in the degree of detachment influence the need for informa-tion.
Polyserial correlation is required because physical distance is a continuous variable, whereas number of local contacts is an ordinal variable (right). The regression line on the left is an exponential fit with R R 2 =0 . 74 . Note the logarithmic axes of the left figure. ) between Slope of the correlation significant at p&lt; 0 . 01 .

Clusters of queries have been shown in the past to repre-sent di ff erent information needs [6, 7]. Therefore, we clus-tered the queries to identify the di ff erent information needs in our data (separately for each event). After stemming and stop-word removal, each query was represented by its TF-IDF model. The queries were then clustered using the k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure. The number of clusters was determined by running the algorithm five times using an increasing number of clusters, and using the largest number of clusters which did not generate single-ton clusters during any of the five runs. This resulted in 4 clusters for the San Bruno and New York events, and three clusters for the Alaska event. We note that we did not use measures of detachment during clustering.

If the clustering has identified di ff erent aspects of the topic, we expect users to have a tendency to post queries which will be part of the same clusters. We measured this hypothesis using the Pearson goodness-of-fit test. This mea-sures, for each user, if the distribution of queries to clusters is significantly di ff erent from the same distribution averaged for all users.

We limited this test to users who posted 5 or more queries related to an event so as to obtain good estimates of the distribution. Significance level was determined using a False Detection Rate [2] level of 0.1%.

We found that for the 27% of users of the San Bruno event, 18% of users of the New York event, and 7% of users of the Alaska event had a distribution statistically signifi-cantly di ff erent from the prior. As a comparison, running this test with randomly permuted data resulted, on average, in less than 0.1% of users who had significantly di ff erent dis-tributions. This is a demonstration that the clusters typify di ff erent aspects of the event.

Although the clusters were generated using only the text of the query, we found that they created a partition which is statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis[29], p&lt; 10 both social a ffi nity and physical detachment. This suggests that the textual description of an event (or indeed, the as-pects of an event sought by di ff erent users) is correlated with the detachment level of users.

Figure 4 shows the number of queries from each cluster posted on each day, and the relationship of social and phys-ical detachment on the fraction of queries from each cluster. This figure shows that some clusters have a high preferen-tial physical detachment, for example Cluster 3 in the San Bruno event (Speaman correlation,  X  =  X  0 . 88), while oth-ers, such as Cluster 4 of the San Bruno event have a more pronounced social a ffi nity (Speaman correlation,  X  =0 . 92). Some of the clusters exhibit weak correlations with detach-ment levels. These may be a manifestation of an aspect which is commonly queried across geographic or social radii. Interestingly, di ff erent clusters have di ff erent temporal pat-Figure 3: Fraction of event-related queries as a func-tion of time in the San Bruno event, partitioned by the physical distance of users from the event. The fraction of queries for users far from the event was multiplied 50 times, to be on the same scale as users close to the event. Day zero denotes the day of the explosion. terns. For example, whereas cluster 1 of the Alaska event has a peak lasting for two days, cluster 2 has a spike lasting only one day.

Therefore, our results indicate that users seek di ff erent as-pects of information regarding events, and that their interest strongly correlate with their social and geographic detach-ment. These aspects have di ff erent temporal profiles and textual manifestations.
Results in previous sections suggest that P ( T | u ) is strongly related to d geo ( u, T ) and a soc ( u, T ). Therefore, in this sec-tion we use this finding to identify event-related queries. In Section 4, we identified queries relevant to the event using a term-matching method. However, while this method is easy to use in practice, it is likely to miss some queries which used phrases which a human annotator did not consider when generating the list of keywords for term-matching. In this section we show how profiles created using detachment in-formation can be used to identify seemingly queries relevant to the event but which are not in our seed set.

As an example for seemingly unrelated queries, consider the query  X  X G&amp;E X  (Pacific Gas and Electric), which is the name of a local gas company in San Bruno. This query is submitted on regular days, but during the San Bruno event, it was posted with much higher frequency, as shown in Fig-ure 5. It also exhibited a very di ff erent distance profile. Detecting these types of queries can be useful for under-standing users X  information needs, improving retrieval [12], or aggregating news content [11].

As noted above, each query is represented by its text, as well as the time it was submitted, and the physical and so-cial detachment of the user who submitted the query. For popular queries, we can represent each query as the distribu-tion of these three parameters (time, physical attachment, Figure 5: Number of times the query  X  X G&amp;E X  ap-peared during the San Bruno event. and social attachment). Since in some case there may not be su ffi cient data to estimate the entire distribution with enough confidence, it may be necessary to resort to su ffi -cient statistics.

Our analysis focused on popular queries, which we defined as those queries which appeared at least 100 times during the event interval. We represented each such query by the number of times it appeared on each day, and the aver-age distance of users who posted this query on that day. This use of averages rather than a distribution allowed us to use queries which appeared relatively few times in the data, while maintaining high confidence in the estimation of the query distribution. Approximately 1M queries appeared at least 100 times for each of the three events.

We compared the representation of the popular queries to that of the clusters of queries identified by term-matching (see Section 5.2 for details of the clustering process). The ap-pearance count was compared using linear correlation, and the average distances using Euclidian distance. A linear predictor was then trained to decide on the weight of each parameter (correlation and distance) in the final scoring of each popular query. Positive (event-related) queries were replicated 100 times to mitigate the e ff ect of their sparse-ness in the data (approximately 0.5% of queries were event-related).

In our experiments we used five-fold cross validation, to reduce the chance of overfitting. After finding the appropri-ate weight for each parameter, we measured how well the term-matched queries were identified by the method. The use of term-matched queries as the target queries means our results should be considered an underestimate of the true result.

Term-matched queries are rare in the most popular queries (in the range of 0.1%-0.3%). We therefore report two mea-sures of success in classification: Average precision and lift. For any given fraction of the queries 0 &lt;f &lt; 1, lift [25] is defined as the ratio between the number of event-related queries among the fraction of T queries that are ranked highest by the proposed system, and the expected number of event-related queries in a random sample from the gen-eral query pool of equal size. For example, a lift of 3 at a fraction T = 0.01 means that if we scan the 1% of queries ranked highest by the proposed system, we expect to see three times more event-related queries in this set of queries than in a 0.01-fraction random sample of the queries. Lift measures the precision at a given threshold [9], albeit scaled such that it can be larger than 1.

Table 3 shows the average precision and lift obtained by the system when attempting to identify term-matched queries in the popular queries. The lift is given for 1% of the queries, with and without the use of the physical and social detach-ment measures. The proposed method accurately identifies the term-matched relevant queries, and improves lift and average precision by 18% over count profiles. This is very useful both for improving query routing and for human an-notators to be able to understand the kind of phrases users make use of when searching for information about the event. The detachment profiles improve results (especially in the San Bruno and Alaska cases), though there is no clear pref-erence for use of geographic versus social information. In-terestingly, using both social and geographic detachment re-duced precision. We attribute this to the sparsity of the positive examples, which accounted for around 0.5% of the data.

Anecdotally, when not using the distance profile, the queries ranked high by the predictor, and which are unrelated to the event, are mostly associated with other news events which peaked in interest around the same time as the event of in-terest. This is consistent with the use of such features when detecting newsworthy queries in general rather than for a specific topic [11].

In the case of the San Bruno event, we scanned the highest-ranked queries and found that (excluding the term-matched queries) these included mostly names of local news channels, and event-related queries which contained partially-entered words.

Identifying relevant queries in retrospect (using the query profile over the entire time span of the event) is useful for some applications. However, in most cases one would like to identify event-related queries soon after the event begins. Figure 6 shows the lift obtained by our method when consid-ering the data as it is collected. In this experiment, feature vectors for day n were constructed using the data from days  X  1 to day n (inclusive). As this figure shows, even after only one day of the event, reasonable lift is obtained by our method. This indicates that our method can assist in pin-pointing event-related queries soon after they begin. information. Figure 6: Lift at 1% obtained by using the data from days 0 to N, for the San Bruno event
In Section 5.2 we demonstrated that detachment a ff ects the aspect of the topic which is sought by users. Therefore, we hypothesize that using the detachment information of users, it should be possible to improve retrieval. Our goal is to identify which pages are likely to be of interest to a user, given her specific detachment information.

One way to use detachment information is to augment queries with attachment data and use a ranking algorithm [22] to find an improved page ranking. While this solution is possible, it should be noted that the distribution of user detachments is far from uniform (there are many more users who are far physically from any event than those close to it). Therefore, a large number of data points as well as care is required when training such a model to provide su ffi cient weight to examples of sparsely-represented detachment val-ues.

An alternative solution is to partition the data according to detachment metrics, and train a di ff erent ranking model for each detachment partition. For example, one model can be trained for those users who are 10km or less from the event, and another model can be trained for those users who are located 10km or more from the event. In the following we take this approach, and build models according to the physical detachment level and/or the social detachment level of users.

We randomly chose approximately 16,000 queries for each of the three events. For each of the queries we extracted the pages presented to users as the search engine results, as well as whether the user clicked each page. A page was consid-ered of interest if it was clicked by the user [16]. We note that our analysis, which was performed after the event, suf-fers from a certain selection bias by users because the initial ranking of documents was generated by the search engine, over which we had no control. Each page was represented by its rank on the results page (which is a proxy for its per-ceived importance as estimated by the search engine) and the second-level URL information, e.g., the address http: //news.yahoo.com would be represented as news . This in-formation is important because second-level domains are usually indicative of the type of information on the web site, and are especially useful when distinguishing news and non-news web sites.

Users were partitioned into five groups according to their physical distance from the event, using logarithmical-spaced bins, or to one of three social attachment groups: No local contacts, one local contact, and more than one such con-tact. We trained one set of models for each detachment type separately and for the combination of the detachment levels. As a baseline, we trained a single model for the en-tire data (without detachment information). All else being equal, since this model was trained using more data, it could be expected to perform better than the partitioned model. The model used for identifying relevant documents was a decision tree classifier. We used five-fold cross validation in our experimentation, and measured the mean average preci-sion (MAP) and the average precision at the top 5 and top 10 documents (denoted as P@5 and P@10, respectively).
Table 4 shows the results of our experiments. The models which use detachment information obtained a statistically significant improvement over the baseline. Separately, using social detachment gave a larger improvement over the base-line than physical detachment. The improvement in MAP using social detachment information over the baseline was, on average 10%. Improvement in P@5 was 5% and in P@10 2%. Interestingly, using both detachment parameters gave only marginal improvements over social detachment alone. We attribute this to the correlation between the social and physical information, as well as to sparseness of the training data for some models.

We did not find a trend which suggests that the proposed method improves (or decreases) retrieval performance as a function of detachment levels. Rather, gain is distributed across all detachment levels.

Unsurprisingly, the most indicative attributes of models built for users closer to the event featured local news outlets (newspapers and TV channels), whereas for users far from the event these included mostly national news channels and web aggregators such as Yahoo news.

We conclude that the use of detachment information is beneficial in improving retrieval. not pairwise statistically significant.
In this paper we investigated the e ff ect of social and geo-graphic detachment of users of information need. We found that the level of detachment has a significant e ff ect on both the level of interest and the type of interest that users have in an event.

The aspects we identified were limited by the fact that only query text was used as their input. In future work, we intend to use more robust clustering and similarity measures [19, 21, 26]. This will allow us to better understand the semantics of aspects, especially as they are understood by the users.

The improvement attained by using social detachment in both applications was markedly better than that of geo-graphic detachment when measured by high-precision met-rics (lift, P@5 and P@10). Geographic detachment was bet-ter in terms of average precision. We speculate that this is due to the relative sparsity of non-zero social detachment compared to geographic data as well as to the importance of social connections.

Although our sample is limited, our results indicate that highly localized events such as the San Bruno event, tend to be explained better by attachments than events which take place over wider areas such as the other two events. Further research of additional events is required in order to generalize these findings.

An interesting question which arises from our work is the relationship between media (social and commercial) and users X  information seeking, as manifested by the query log. The temporal behavior is highly correlated, and includes the appearance of idiosyncratic peaks such as those on day 4 of the San Bruno event. Furthermore, as Figure 1 shows, inter-est in the Alaska elections is almost entirely limited to dates after the elections themselves. This is surprising, because it indicates that interest in these election is almost solely related to the results of the election and not to candidates X  work or people X  X  need for information about voting proce-dures, etc, prior to the election. This might hint that query log volume is driven to some extent by media interest, but further experimentation is required to validate this link.
Setting the number of local users for finding those who may be influenced by an event was performed in this study using a simple heuristic which is finding all the people in a radius enclosing the urban population which may have been a ff ected by the event. However, if we aim to automate the improvement in search result, the finding of this radius needs to be automated.

One way to estimate the radius of influence is derived in [1]. However, in that study only geographic location was taken into account as influencing the radius of influence. Furthermore, the frequency of queries was posited to decay exponentially as a function of distance. However, our ob-servations are that, because of the location of population centers in relation to the location of an event, the decay in frequency of queries does not follow a simple exponential.
Bernard et al. [3] discussed the question of estimating the number of people who died in an earthquake from an entire population based on sampling a population and de-termining how many people they knew, first-hand, who had died, as well as the average number of acquaintances each person has (e.g., their immediate social network). Apply-ing this method to our work, the radius of influence can be set to contain the estimated number of a ff ected users, given the other parameters. We plan to verify the utility of this method and, as it is considered a lower bound on the num-ber of a ff ected users, measure how close its estimates are to the ones identified by our heuristic.
