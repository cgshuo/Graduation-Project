LNCS Sublibrary: S L 3  X  Information Systems and Application, incl. Internet/Web and HCI Welcome to the proceedings of APWeb 2014! This was the 16th edition of the Asia Pacific Web Conference. Since the first APWeb conference started in 1998, APWeb has evolved with the time to lead the frontier of data-driven informa-tion technology research. It has now firmly established itself as a leading Asia Pacific-focused international conference on research, development, and advanced applications on large-scale data management, Web and search technologies, and information processing. Previous APWeb conferences were held in Sydney (2013), Kunming (2012), Beijing (2011), Busan (2010), Suzhou (2009), Shenyang (2008), Huangshan (2007), Harbin (2006), Shanghai (2005), Hangzhou (2004), Xi X  X n (2003), Changsha (2001), Xi X  X n (2000), Hong Kong (1999), and Beijing (1998). sha, China, a city proud of its history of 3,000 years. The conference moved from its usual spring slot to be held with the VLDB conference this year, which took place immediately before APWeb in Hangzhou, China. That was the third time that APWeb was synchronized with a major database conference held in China (i.e., SIGMOD 2007 in Beijing, and ICDE 2009 in Shanghai). The host orga-nization of APWeb 2014 was the National University of Defence Technology, a leading university in China best known for developing the currently fastest supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-2.
 ference with research papers, an industry track, tutorials, demos, and a panel. APWeb this year received 134 paper subm issions to the main conference from North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Each submitted paper underwent a rigorous review process by at least three independent members of the Program Committee, with detailed revie w reports. Finally, 34 full research papers and 23 short research papers were accepted and included in these proceed-ings, from Australia, Canada, China, Italy, Luxembourg, Japan, New Zealand, and Tunisia. The conference this year also had three satellite workshops.  X  First International Workshop on Social Network Analysis (SNA 2014)  X  First International Workshop on Network and Information Security  X  First International Workshop on Internet of Things Search (IoTS 2014) ers: Binxing Fang (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China), Christian Jensen (Aalborg University, Denmark) and Divesh Srivastava (AT&amp;T, USA). The two tutorial presenters were Xin Luna Dong (Google, USA) and Feifei Li (University of Utah, USA). Starting from this edition, APWeb included a new exciting program, the Distinguished Lect ure Series, co-chaired this year by Xin Luna Dong (Google, USA) and Jiaheng Lu (Renmin University of China), to invite active, high-achieving, and mostly pre-tenture researchers to discuss their work at APWeb. The four speakers this year are Fabian Suchanek (Telecom ParisTech, France), Nan Tang (QCRI, Qatar), Steven Whang (Google, USA), and Xiaokui Xiao (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore).
