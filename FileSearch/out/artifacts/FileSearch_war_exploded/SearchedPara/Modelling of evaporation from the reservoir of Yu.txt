 1. Introduction
Evaporation from dams X  surface is crucial in terms of water resources management and pla nning. Thus, dam water surface evaporation should be taken into account for the planning of water budget of dams. Evapo ration can be either measured with an evaporation pan (pan evaporimeter) or estimated from meteorologi-cal data. The Class A pan evaporimeter is one of the most widely used instruments for the measurement of evaporation.

It is impractical to place evaporation pans at every point where also highly unlikely to have in inaccessible areas where accurate instruments cannot be established or maintained. A practical means of estimating the amount of pan evaporation where no pans are available is of considerable significance to the hydrol-ogists, agriculturists, and meteorologists.

A number of researchers have attempted to estimate the evaporation values from climatic variables ( Stephens and Stewart, 1963; Linarce, 1967; Reis and Dias, 1998; Coulomb et al., 2001;
Gavin and Agnew, 2004 ), and most of these methods require data that are not easily available. Simple methods that are reported (e.g., Stephens and Stewart, 1963 ) try to fit a linear relationship between the variables. However, the process of evaporation is highly, nonlinear in nature, as it is evidenced by many of the estimation procedures. Many researchers have emphasized the need for accurate estimates of evaporation in hydrologic model-ling studies ( Sudheer et al., 2002 ). This requirement could be addressed through better models that will address the inherent non-linearities in the process.

In the past few decades, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been extensively used in a wide range of engineering applications. Recently, ANNs have recently gained increasing applications in modelling daily soil evaporation ( Han and Felker, 1997), daily (Sudheer et al., 2002; Keskin and Terzi, 2006 ) and daily actual crop evapotranspiration ( Sudheer et al., 2003 ).Despite a number of advantages, traditional neural network models have several draw-backs including possibility of getting trapped in local minima, and subjectivity in the choice of model architecture ( Suykens, 2001). To overcome these drawbacks of traditional neural networks and to increase their reliability, many new training algorithms have been this paradigm, one of the significant developments is a adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

The research presented in this study is motivated by a desire to explore the potential of ANFIS estimation of pan evaporation. The ANFIS model applied for estimating pan evaporation owing to its ability to provide good generalization performance in capturing nonlinear regression relationships between predictors and the predictand. The performance of the ANFIS model is compared with MLR. Comparison of the results shows that the ANFIS model is superior to MLR model. 2. Methods This section of this paper provides description of the ANFIS and
MLR techniques in detail for evaporation modelling. 2.1. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
Jang, (1993) introduced for the first time an architecture and a learning procedure for the fuzzy in ference systems (FIS) that uses a neural network learning algorithm for constructing a set of fuzzy if-then rules with appropriate membership functions (MFs) from the the framework of adaptive neural networks is called an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (A NFIS). There are two methods that
ANFIS learning employs for updat ing membership function para-meters: (1) backpropagation for all parameters (a steepest descent method); and (2) a hybrid method consisting of backpropagation for the parameters associated with the input membership and least squares estimation for the parameters associated with the output the optimal ones, the easier it will be for the model parameter training to converge. Human expertise about the target system to be modeled may aid in setting up these initial membership function
For instance, assume that the FIS has two inputs x and y and one output f . For the first order Sugeno fuzzy model, a typical rule set with two fuzzy if-then rules can be expressed as
Rule 1. If x is A 1 and y is B 1 , then f  X  p 1 x  X  q 1 y  X  r 1 ,  X  1  X 
Rule 2. If x is A 2 and y is B 2 , then f  X  p 2 x  X  q 2 y  X  r 2 ,  X  2  X  p , q , r 1 and p 2 , q 2 , r 2 are the parameters of the output function. The functioning of the ANFIS is described as
Layer 1. Every node in this layer produces membership grades of an input parameter. The node output O 1 , i is explained by,
O  X  m A i  X  x  X  , for i  X  1 , 2 ,  X  3  X  or
O  X  m B i 2  X  y  X  , for i  X  3 , 4 ,  X  4  X  where x (or y ) is the input to the node i ; A i (or B i 2 set and it specifies the degree to which the given input x (or y ) satisfies the quantifier. MFs can be Gaussian, generalized bell shaped, triangular and trapezoidal shaped functions. A general-ized bell shaped function is described as  X  x  X  X  the MF degree with maximum value equal to 1 and minimum equal to 0.
 output is the product of all incoming signals
O  X  w i  X  m Ai  X  x  X  m Bi  X  y  X  , i  X  1 , 2  X  6  X 
Layer 3. The i th node of this layer, labeled N, calculates the normalized firing strength as
O  X  w i  X 
Layer 4. Every node i in this layer is an adaptive node with a node function,
O  X  w i f i  X  w i  X  p i x  X  q i y  X  r i  X  ,  X  8  X  of this node.

Layer 5. The single node in this layer is a fixed node labeled S , which computes the overall output as the summation of all incoming signals f  X  Overall outputt  X  O 5 , i  X  S 2.2. Multiple linear regression (MLR)
If it is assumed that the dependent variable Y is affected by m independent variables X 1 , X 2 , y , X m and a linear equation is selected for the relation among them, the regression equation of Y w w can be written as y  X  a  X  b 1 x 1  X  b 2 x 2  X  :::  X  b m x m  X  10  X  y in this equation shows the expected value of the variable Y when the independent variables take the values X 1  X  x 1 , X
X  X  x m .

The regression coefficients a , b 1 , b 2 , y , b m are evaluated, similar to simple regression, by minimizing the sum of the e distances of observation points from the plane expressed by the regression equation ( Bayaz X t and Oguz, 1998 ):
In this study, the coefficients of the regressions were determined using least square method. 3. Compilation of data
The study area is the Yuvacik Dam Basin which is in the eastern part of Marmara Region of Turkey at about 40 1 32 0  X  40 1 41 0 North and 29 1 29 0  X 30 1 08 0 East and located 12 km south of Kocaeli city. Yuvacik dam was built in 1999. The drainage area of
Yuvacik Dam basin is about 257.8 km 2 . The location of the station is depicted in Fig. 2 .

Yuvacik Dam Reservoir is used as a drinking and irrigation water source. The water level of Yuvacik Dam is decreased below the level of active volume due to little precipitation in 2006.
Meteorological data from Yuvacik Dam station, consisting of 352 daily records (the drought year of 2006) are used to develop the models of daily pan evaporation. The data set of January 01, 2006 to December 31, 2006 (352 data set) were used for modeling daily evaporation. To develop an ANFIS and MLR models for estimating
E , the available data set was partitioned into a training set and a test set according to station. About 232 daily data set of the available record was selected for training while the remaining 120 daily data set was used for testing. The daily solar radiation ( R air temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (U obtained from the Automated GroWeather Meteorological Yuva-cik Dam Station which are logged every 2 h are used in the study.
Two hourly data are integrated subsequently to obtain daily data, because the pan evaporation (E) values used as output in the ANFIS and MLR models are daily measurements obtained from the Directorate of State Hydraulic Works, Turkey.
 The daily statistical parameters of each data are given in Table 1 . In this table, x mean , S x , C v , C sx , x min mean, standard deviation, variation, skewness coefficient, minimum and maximum of the data, respectively. It is clearly seen from Table 1 the mostly varied ( C v  X  0.89 mm) data is E . Its minimum value is 0.0023 while its mean and maximum values are 2.45 and 8.475, respectively. All the data sets have high correlation between E except the wind speed. The highest correlation coefficient with the E (0.904) belongs to the R There is an inverse proportion between RH and E with a negative correlation of 0.706. 3.1. Application of ANFIS model
In this study, before the training of the model both input and output variables were normalized within the range 0.1 X 0.9 as follows: x  X  0 : 8  X  x x min  X   X  x where x i is the normalized value of a certain parameter, x is the measured value for this parameter, x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values in the database for this parameter, respectively. 3.2. Selection of input parameters for the ANFIS
The selection of the input parameters is a very important aspect for the neural network modeling. In order to use ANFIS structures effectively, input variables in the phenomenon must be selected with a great care. This highly depends on the better understanding of the problem. In a firm ANFIS architecture, in order not to confuse training process key variables must be introduced and unnecessary variables must be avoided. For this purpose, a sensitivity analysis can be used to find out the key parameters. Also sensitivity analysis can be useful to determine the relative importance of the parameters when sufficient data are available. The sensitivity analysis is used to determine the effect of changes and to determine relative importance or effectiveness of a variable on the output. The input variables that do not have a significant effect on the performance of an ANFIS can be excluded from the input variables, resulting in a more compact network. Then, it becomes necessary to work on methods like sensitivity analysis to make ANFIS work effectively.
Evaporation depends on the some independent parameters and those can be given in this form: E  X  f ( R s , T, RH, U 2 3.3. Sensitivity analysis
It appears that while assessing the performance of any model for its applicability in estimating E , it is not only important to evaluate the average prediction error but also the distribution of prediction errors. The statistical performance evaluation criteria employed so far in this study are global statistics ( R 2 and do not provide any information on the distribution of errors.
Therefore, in order to test the robustness of the model developed, it is important to test the model using some other performance evaluation criteria such as average absolute relative error (AARE).
The AARE not only gives the performance index in terms of predicting E but also shows the distribution of the prediction errors.
 These criteria can be computed as AARE  X  1 N RE  X  t p o p t where RE is the relative error in forecast expressed as percentage, t is the observed E for the pth pattern; and o p is the computed E for the pth pattern which is produced by ANFIS; and N is the total number of the testing patterns. Clearly the smaller the value of AARE is, the better the performance.

The performance control of the ANFIS output was evaluated by estimating the determination coefficient (R 2 ) which is defined as R  X  where E  X  E  X  where, t mean is the mean E , The mean Square error (MSE) is defined as MSE  X  1 N
Solar radiation R s is used as the common parameter for the rest of the sensitivity analysis. Performance evaluation of all possible combination of variables such that each and every combination includes E , was also investigated. 4. Results and discussion
The four ANFIS models were established using each independent parameter is determined as R s , solar radiation.
 The findings obtained from the sensitivity analysis are listed in
Table 2 . Based on the findings, as depicted in Table 2 the ANFIS model has four inputs ( R s ,T, RH, U 2 ) gives the best estimation.
The final architectures of the ANFIS models that were found after and gaussmf denote the triangle, trapezoid, gumbell and gaussian
MFs, respectively. The MSE and R 2 values of each ANFIS model in test
The error tolerance in training is used as a stopping criterion. The study, membership function para meters were iteratively learned using hybrid method. The maximum number of training epochs was set to 2. The rules of the ANFIS model (xi) which showed the highest accuracy are provided in Table 4 .

After training the ANFIS model, test performance was checked. The performance of ANFIS for prediction of E is demonstrated in Fig. 4 .
Fig. 4 also shows an analysis between the network outputs (estimations) and the corresponding targets (observed data) for the
These are 6 very small values. It can be seen clearly From Fig. 4 and their range change from 0.0023 to 0.0127 mm (from day 16 to day 21). These 6 daily sequence data were collected during winter (from 02.21.2006 to 02.25.2006). There is no very low E observation seen either during winter or other seasons of year 2006 except these 6 days. Furthermore, the other meteo rological data are not drastically changed during these 6 days. The reason of these low observations could be inaccurate measurements.

It is known that the accuracy of measurements from automated pan evaporation devices is highly dependent upon the amount and quality of maintenance they receive. Pressure transducers for measuring water height in evaporation pans are prone to malfunction due to electrical problems. Automated pan evaporation measurement devices which rely on floats can become stuck, significantly
The performance criteria for the test results of the MLR model is given in Table 5 . As can be seen from Table 5 , the model has the highest MSE and AARE and the lowest R 2 values when R s is only used as input. However, it is clearly seen that the from Table 5 adding the relative humidity and wind velocity to the input combinations (R s +T) significantly increases the models X  performances. The MLR estimates for combination R s +T+RH+ U are demonstrated in Fig. 5 . The MLR has better estimates. However, it gives some negative values for the lowest value of
E . It is a drawback for the MLR ( Fig. 5 ). 5. Conclusion
The present study demonstrates the capabilities of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system technique (ANFIS) for evaporation modeling, however the choice of ANFIS architecture and input parameters are crucial for obtaining good estimate accuracy. Thus, sensitivity analysis had been conducted to determine the degree of effectiveness of the variables by using various performance statistics. From the results obtained, an ANFIS model appears to than the other three parameters. Remaining parameters were used one by one in estimating E . After the application of sensitivity analysis, other effective parameters were determined as air temperature T , relative humidity RH and wind speed U respectively. The models whose inputs are the wind speed, solar radiation, relative humidity and air temperature have the best performance criteria among the input combinations tried in the study. This indicates that all these variables are needed for better evaporation modeling. The MLR has also better estimates.
However, it is giving some negative values for the lowest value of E estimation. It is a drawback for the MLR. Based on the comparison results, the ANFIS technique was found to be superior to the MLR technique.
