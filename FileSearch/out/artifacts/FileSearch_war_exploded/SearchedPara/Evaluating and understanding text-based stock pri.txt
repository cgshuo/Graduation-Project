Design of empirical models using text mining be seen from the table, most of the models predicted classes of movement (e.g. up/down) instead of the actual values.

Text mining
Text mining concerns the process of automatically extracting novel, non-trivial information from unstructured text doc-de Fortuny, De Smedt, Martens, &amp; Daelemans, 2012 ).
 2.1.2. Combining information
Amongst others, Li, Wang, Dong, and Wang (2011) and Schumaker and Chen (2009b) remark that using only textual infor-mation can be too limiting because the approach disregards other (complementary) information. Imagine that a negative (which can induce a bias of the investors). 2.2. Proposed model research question is thus: nality next to the traditional trade model features? tion whether this is actually a good measure based on our own results. This leads us to the second research question:
Furthermore, we noticed that many of the models built in the literature use complex modelling techniques that result in into these models to assess whether the decision is correct or not.

Research Question 3 How can we gain insight into text-mining-based stock-prediction models? 3. Evaluation of empirical models
We have encountered a variety of evaluation metrics, with most studies basing their conclusions solely on one or two their main advantages and drawbacks. 3.1.

Profit . Almost every study we found included some form of profit measurement. Some simulate the trading model with a the (arithmetic) Rate of Return (ROR) of each trading decision, defined as: where p t  X  l is the selling price of the commodity and p
The average ROR is not without flaws either: particularly it does not take into account the actual risk undertaken by trading upon the built system. In support of the Random Walk Theory, Malkiel (2005) argues that professional investment managers have not been able to consistently outperform their index benchmarks. More specifically, he above-average risk  X  X . We should therefore test our models in a trading simulation using a risk-weighted evaluation metric, discussed next.

Ideally, we want to generate a value at least higher than zero (profit). 3.3. In-time or out-of-time?

In the next sections we will briefly discuss each of these components. 4.1. Support Vector Machines m -dimensional input vectors x  X f x 1 ; ... ; x m g and corresponding binary class labels y the classifier should satisfy the following conditions: which is equivalent to (for a dataset of size n ) space, the above inequalities construct a hyperplane w T u  X  x  X  X  b  X  0, that discriminates between the two classes. By minimizing w T w , the margin between both classes is maximized.

In primal weight space the classifier takes the form in summary, the problem is recast to an optimization problem that is solved using Lagrange multipliers, leading to the following classifier: typically has the following choices: the data and speed considerations. 4.2. Input data 4.2.1. Document data acquisition and selection overview of all of the newspapers included in this study is displayed in Table 2 .

 the stock symbol. The following cases are considered: 1. Include only the headline. 2. Use all textual data of the article. 3. Use only textual data in the same paragraph as the first occurrence of the key word: the paragraph is defined as one
The rationale behind the third approach is that an article can contain many stock symbol names at the same time or switch tone. For each of these cases we consider both the textual input, as well as the sentiment polarity score after sentiment analysis.
 4.2.2. Document data preprocessing concept expression in the corpus and allows the learner to focus on content words.

In order to be able to compare documents of different lengths each row (document) rescaled by the inverse document frequency (idf), leading to the input matrix tfidf: on information from the training set only. Each row in the resulting matrix represents one of the input vectors x given as input to the SVM. 4.2.3. Document sentiment polarity negation words (e.g., not fascinating) and subsequent exclamation marks.

In previous research, the lexicon was tested with a set of 2000 Dutch online book reviews. Each review also has a user-of 72 % and a recall of 82 % ( De Smedt &amp; Daelemans, 2012b ).

In our approach, we calculate the polarity of each adjective that occurs in the input text. The aforementioned third scores 0.17:

Stock tick data acquisition We have gathered two datasets containing quote data for all of the stock symbols in Table 3 on the Euronext Brussels stock symbols for a period of four months from January 1, 2012 up to March 5, 2012. 4.3.2. Quote-to-label mapping
In order to simplify the learning system, the problem is reduced to that of predicting a subset of possible stock move-movement) or the directionality of the movement of a stock quote as opposed to predicting the true value. The target The relative movement of a quote is defined as:
In our two-class setting, we defined a class for a positive inclination (i.e., D

Area under curve indicators perform significantly better than all other models (including a completely random model) except for the sentiment-title model (using a Wilcoxon signed rank test, significance level p &lt; 0 : 05).
The sentiment results are inconsistent and often underperform the other models as compared to the bag-of-words sentiment extraction model was trained (book reviews), sentiment in financial texts can be found more predominantly in by itself does not provide enough information and needs to be used conjointly with other information. Although there is strong evidence to believe the sentiment model simply underperformed, it remains difficult to trace the exact reasons and magnitude of the low discriminative power of sentiment. This is one of the drawbacks of using an aggregate measure such as sentiments, as we will see, the BOW approach does not suffer from this flaw. 5.1.3.

 We encountered similar ambiguous results depending on the metric used for the hybrid model. In terms of the average
Sharpe ratio and returns, the hybrid model roughly shows the same behavior: the faster acting models outperform the slower models with the exception of the one-day-ahead model. In terms of return rates and Sharpe ratio the models reach individual models.

We have considered several measures to determine whether the model performs better than random or not. For the mod-et al., 2010 ), backtesting is advised in order to ensure the continuing correctness of the models. sight, we would recommend using the individual models instead for reasons of transparency. 6. Conclusion
We have built several models that forecast stock price movement directionality based on news data, their sentiments and advise future research to use similar techniques to go beyond a simple aggregate performance metric to validate trading models, especially when attempting to provide counter-evidence for the Efficient Market Hypothesis.
During the operating phase of the models, we recommend using these highly technical models and easily interpretable advised in order to ensure to continuing correctness of the models.

In future research, we would like to expand our techniques to include even more variables and apply it to other markets stock market.
