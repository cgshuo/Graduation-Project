With the constantly increasing reach of the Web in gen-eral and Social Media in particular, more and more people of different nationalities, cultures, origins and beliefs con-tribute and access online information. These differences ex-press themselves in language, habits, behavioural patterns, socio-cultural norms and values. They also strongly influ-ence the way users provide and formulate content as well as the way they request, acquir e, interpret and access infor-mation. Therefore, the detection and use of cultural differ-ences and diversity will become more and more a key chal-lenge in both, Information Retrieval and Knowledge Man-agement. The aim of the DETECT workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners dealing with inter-cultural, multi-lingual and multi-national information en-vironments in distinct contexts, and discover synergies be-tween their research fields.

The workshop program reflects very well the variety of aspects and applications to culture related topics in social media. Two key notes address the topics of diversity and personalization [3] as well as approaches for a behavioural analysis of users [6]. Thereby, the two opposite view points on cultural aspects in social media are addressed: the con-sumers side of searching and reading social news items and the authors side of creating and publishing such information.
Also the wide range of contributions to DETECT X 11 re-flects the various relevant technologies and research ques-tions in the workshop X  X  context. Ranging from works ad-dressing fundamental key technologies like text and image classification over mining patterns of common usage or user behaviour over time and space to end user issues of how to deal with cultural diversity on the social web.

Boato et al. [1] consider the application of classifying the emotions associated with pictures. Given the recent interest in sentiment analysis before the background of social media, this topic provides insights suitable to the foundations of social media research.

Nishida et al. [5] address the difficult task of classification on microblogs. Using a data compression approach intro-duces a method which might be very suitable to handle the immanent feature sparsity of Twitter and the like.
Martin [4] presents an analytical tool to follow web users in order to improve the usability of web sites. Identifying common usage patterns and relating them to different cul-tural backgrounds is a step in the direction of tailoring online services to particular user needs.

Kling and Gottron [2] automatically extract cultural re-gions from flickr images annotated with geographic coordi-nates, which in turn allows to detect culturally similar areas directly from social media data.

Wijaya and Yeniterzi [8] look at the evolution of the se-mantics of words over time. This work adds a time compo-nent to cultural topics which enriches social media analysis with another additional and important dimension.
Welzer et al. [7] look at cultural awareness in social media and consider in particular the question of creating awareness for cultural differences in cross cultural interactions.
The goal of the final break-out session and plenary discus-sion is to identify key research questions for detecting and exploiting cultural diversity on the social web. A desirable outcome is an agenda of research challenges that need to be addressed in the years to come in order to promote the progress in the fields relevant to the DETECT workshop. This also includes the identification of interesting areas for potential collaborations among the workshop participants. [1] G. Boato, M. Della Giacoma, and P. Zontone. Emotion [2] C. C. Kling and T.
