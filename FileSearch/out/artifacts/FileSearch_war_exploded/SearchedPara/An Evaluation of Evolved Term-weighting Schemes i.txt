 This paper presents an evaluation of evolved term-weightin g schemes on short, medium and long TREC queries. A previ-ously evolved global (collection-wide) term-weighting sc heme is evaluated on unseen TREC data and is shown to increase mean average precision over idf . A local (within-document) evolved term-weighting scheme is presented which is depen-dent on the best performing global scheme. The full evolved scheme (i.e. the combined local and global scheme) is com-pared to both the BM25 scheme and the Pivoted Normali-sation scheme.

Our results show that the local evolved solution does not perform well on some collections due to its document nor-malisation properties and we conclude that Okapi-tf can be tuned to interact effectively with the evolved global weight -ing scheme presented and increase mean average precision over the standard BM25 scheme.

Evolutionary computation techniques are proving to be a viable alternative to other standard analytical methods in many areas of IR. Genetic Programming (GP) [3] has been shown to be an effective approach to learning term-weighting schemes in IR [5]. These approaches, inspired by Darwin X  X  theory of Natural Selection, are stochastic in nature and efficient for searching large complex search spaces.
This paper presents term-weighting schemes which have been evolved in a vector space framework. Our research dif-fers from previous approaches as we break this process into two steps. Firstly, we evolve weighting schemes in a global domain which promote the best terms to use in distinguish-ing documents. Then, using the best global scheme, we evolve local schemes which use within-document measures to improve the mean average precision (MAP) of the system. This process eases analysis of the evolved schemes and im-portantly reduces the size of the search space by separating the measures into their respective domains.
GP [3] is an automated searching algorithm inspired by biological evolution. In the GP process, a population of so-lutions is created randomly. These solutions, encoded as trees, undergo generations of selection, reproduction and mutation until suitable solutions are found. In our system, term-weighting schemes are the individuals in our environ-ment and the MAP of these solutions is used as the fitness function. Thus, the global ( gw t ) and local ( lw t ) schemes are evolved in the following full weighting for a term t : where qtf is the actual term-frequency of term t in the query. It can be seen that BM25 fits this model when gw t is equal to idf t and lw t is equal to Okapi -tf .
We use the BM25 scheme and the pivoted normalisa-tion scheme [4] as benchmarks. We use the default term-frequency influence value of k 1 = 1 . 2 and the normalisation influence value of b = 0 . 75. We also use the pivoted nor-malisation scheme ( P iv ) with the slope ( s ) set to 0 . 2 as a benchmark. We use the actual within-query term-frequency scheme ( qtf ) with both benchmark schemes as in (1).
We use collections from TREC disks 4 and 5 to test our schemes. A different set of 50 TREC topics is used for each of the collections. For each set of topics we create a short query set (s), consisting of the title field of the topics, a medium length query set (m), consisting of the title and description fields, and a long query set (l) consisting of the title, description and narrative fields. Standard stop-wor ds are stemmed using Porter X  X  algorithm. No additional words are removed from the narrative fields as is the case in some approaches.
A previously evolved global weighting [1], evolved on about 35,000 OHSUMED documents, is used in this research and is as follows: where df t is the document frequency and cf t is the fre-quency of t in the entire collection of N documents.
Table 2 shows the MAP of the gw t against the idf t mea-sure used in the BM25 scheme with a binary weighting on the within-document weighting ( k 1 = 0).

The increase in MAP for the gw t scheme over the idf benchmark is greater for longer queries. We can see that for the longest queries on both collections there is a considera ble amount of noisy terms included in the narrative field of each topic as the MAP decreases for idf for the same information need (topic). The evolved global scheme is better able to correctly weight these noisy terms because of the presence of the cf terminal which produces a measure of density for a term [1, 2]. In general, the longer the query the better the performance of the evolved global scheme. This is because the number of terms that are assigned inappropriate weights under idf increases. For example, the global weighting for a short query of length one is irrelevant because only within-document features will change the score of a document.
Using a similar approach to that adopted in [1], we evolved the following local weighting scheme on the same 35,000 OHSUMED documents while keeping the gw t global scheme constant: where tf is the term-frequency and l is the number of unique terms in the document. Table 3 shows that the full evolved scheme ( evol t ) is comparable to BM 25 in terms of MAP on the LATIMES collections but at lower recall (P@10) is significantly poorer than BM25 on both collec-tions. The main difference between the OHSUMED train-ing data and the other test collections is that the document lengths of the latter are significantly longer. Thus, we inco r-perated the same term-influence factor as lw t into Okapi -tf . It is trivial to show that this scheme X  X  term-frequency influ -ence is similar to that of Okapi -tf when k 1 = 0 . 2. As a consequence, we also evaluate a hybrid scheme which uses the gw t evolved global weight and Okapi -tf when k 1 = 0 . 2. For this scheme, which we will call ok -gw t , b remains 0.75. This hybrid scheme has better normalisation properties tha n evol t on longer documents and is consistently better than BM 25 and P iv in terms of MAP.

Table 4 shows the p-value for a one-tailed pairwise t-test for each of the 50 topics. It also shows the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in MAP between ok -gw t BM 25. We can see that there is an increase in variability in the difference in MAP as the lengths of the topics increase. Table 4: 95% CI for  X  MAP for ok -gw t and BM 25
We have shown that global weighting schemes can be found by evolutionary techniques that outperform idf on general collections. We have also shown that GP can also be used to tune existing schemes to best interact with newly developed schemes. The most effective scheme identified is a combination of Okapi-tf and the evolved global scheme.
