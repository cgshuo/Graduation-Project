 Traditional recommendation systems use multiple computa-tional techniques to perform personalized recommendations, and can consider the interests of users and even the context in which they live. However, they usually ignore each in-dividual X  X  personality factors, and hence, the recommenda-tions generated overwhelmingly consider that all the users are identical psychologically. They ignore, for example, the curiosity level of each user, which may indicate that individ-uals with a high level of curiosity seek visit exotic locations and/or not yet visited by them, or even individuals with a low curiosity level tend to do the same things they did in the past, uninterested in new or different areas.

Our paper presents a complete hybrid recommendation system considering the curiosity level of each individual as a decisive factor to recommend sites of South America. In order to prove the efficiency of our system in contrast to traditional recommendation systems, as well as to measure the satisfaction of users about the recommendations, we per-formed some preliminary experiments with the participation of 105 Brazilian volunteers. The first results indicate that considering the level of curiosity of a user increases the sat-isfaction with the recommendations.

 c  X  rates and high performance, besides to overcome already known obstacles in the area of content recommendation, for example: limited content analysis, super-specialization and cold start problem [1]. Hence, in these last few years, several lines of study have been developed, in order to consider the psychological characteristics of users, giving a greater weight to what people feel and think, instead of simply consider their previous purchases or people with similar profiles.
In the literature we can find a wide variety of academic papers related to recommendation systems for individuals and groups, using both traditional methods and hybrid ap-plications. However, papers that use psychology in recom-mendation systems are still rarely found.

We can highlight the work in [6]. It describes three algo-rithms to model and predict the satisfaction experienced by individuals using a recommender system for groups, which recommends sequences of items. By analysing the impact on satisfaction of the following item after visualize the pre-vious one, they could model the wearing-off effect and the assimilation effect, in order to select the next item. An-other research presented in [8], proposes a new method of performing recommendations for groups bearing in mind the personality of the group members and how they deal with conflicts.

This work introduces a complete recommendation system that combines theoretical psychological models with the con-temporary idea of positive psychology to enhance the perfor-mance of traditional recommendation systems for tourist do-mains. This system presents two important features. First, data collected from a social network is analysed in order to calculate the level of curiosity of a given user. Then, through an online recommendation system, we show the user the rec-ommended sites of South America, in order to assess the level of satisfaction of volunteers and, consequently, analyse the efficiency/accuracy of our technique.

This way, we aim to demonstrate that the combination of traditional recommendation techniques by taking into ac-count psychological characteristics of individuals can im-prove the user satisfaction with respect to the recommen-dation. It is expected that this way, we can generate a more  X  X umanized X  recommendation, according to the psychologi-cal characteristics of the individual, being able to positively surprise the users.

This paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce the definition of curiosity and how it can be measured, after we present the architecture of our system and we describe the different modules that compose our system. Next, we detail the performed experiments and the feedback obtained from the volunteers when the recommendations were presented. We finish with some conclusions and further work.
Why some people tend to always travel to the same places while others do not? Why do individuals explore the un-known? What makes people curious? From the publication of the paper  X  X  theory of human curiosity X  by Berlyne in 1954 [2] the word  X  X uriosity X  starts to gain a higher visibil-ity in psychology, and a number of researches have been de-veloped since then, so questions like those can be measured and answered. Curiosity is defined as a desire for acquiring new knowledge and new sensory experience which motivates exploratory behavior [4]. Recent studies have introduced dif-ferent scales to measure the curiosity of an individual, and one of those is the model Curiosity and Exploration Inven-tory (CEI-II) by Kashdan et al. [3], which we have adopted in this project.

This scale is considered one of the most reliable and prac-tical today, consisting by only 10 items (Figure 1). It offers empirical support for two curiosity dimensions: motivation to seek out knowledge and new experiences (Stretching; five items) and a willingness to embrace the novel, uncertain, and unpredictable nature of everyday life (Embracing; five items).

Figure 1: CEI-II Form applied to the participants
This section describes the main aspects of our recommen-dation system. We formulate three hypothesis: (H1) The level of curiosity of a given user may influence his decisions about what places to visit; (H2) It is possible to use data available on social networks like Facebook 1 to measure the level of curiosity; And (H3) the level of curiosity of an in-dividual may play a crucial role in the choice of the recom-mendation technique.

To prove our hypothesis, we have developed a hybrid rec-ommendation system based on human curiosity. Figure 2
Facebook &lt; https://www.facebook.com/ &gt; . shows the architecture of our system which was divided into two main parts: The first one,  X  X odel Generation X , is de-voted to generate a model of curiosity by using information available in Facebook and the CEI-II psychological test and, the second one, the  X  X odel Execution X  applies this model to new users to measure the curiosity level and it is also re-sponsible for the recommendation itself.
The  X  X odel Generation X  phase works in 3 stages, with the aim of generating a curiosity model. For this purpose, we recruited 105 Brazilian volunteers that participated in the project. This set of volunteers is composed by 50% of men and 50% women, from different regions of Brazil, between ages from 18 to 56, whose level of study is: 60% Postgradu-ate, 31% Graduate, 3% High School and 6% Basic Level.
At the first stage (represented by circles in Figure 2) we obtained three types of different information. The first one (Profile) obtains basic data from Facebook in an implicit way (age, gender, marital status, etc). The second one (Sur-vey test) calculates the level of curiosity of each volunteer through the CEI-II questionnaire. And the third type of information (Access to database) consists in implicitly ob-taining Facebook data as likes, groups, visited places, photo tagging etc.

The second stage (represented by squares in Figure 2) comprises Search System for Social Network (SSSN) and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) modules. The SSSN (square in Figure 2) aims  X  X o clean X  data obtained in the previous process, i.e remove repeated, incomplete or inconsistent data, but also SSSN is responsible for classifying the  X  X ikes X  of a given user, in order to better capture his interests. This is performed by selecting the  X  X ame X  field in table  X  X ikes X . In Table 1, we can observe an example of the results obtained with the fan pages classification and groupings performed by category and subcategory.

In the KDD module (square in Figure 2), we receive the data from the survey test and the data previously processed by SSSN, in order to generate the curiosity model through the application of a data mining algorithm. We have per-formed some experiments with three different algorithms: Apriori, J48 and K-means [5].

In our simulations, we obtained better reliability values with the J48 algorithm, the results were: 32.24% for Ex-tremely curious, 64.57% for Moderately curious, 91.03% for Quite a Bit curious and 38.56% for A Little curious. In other words, when introducing a new user (Model Execution) to our system without answering the Survey test, we can infer his curiosity level with the values of reliability mentioned above. Although we think that these values are not good enough, they are promising with respect to the Moderately and Quite a Bit curious users.
The  X  X odel Execution X  is also divided in 3 stages. At stage 1, the system analyses the Facebook data of the user to infer, through the generated model, his level of curiosity (stage 2).

The stage 3, called  X  X uriosity-based recommendation X , consists in our hybrid recommendation system. It uses two basic recommendation techniques: content-based (CB) and collaborative filtering (CF). Then, two lists of recommenda-tions are computed. The first list corresponds to the CB recommendation technique, which uses travelling history to make a list of sites with similar features to those that the user visited in the past. The second list is generated by means of the CF recommendation technique, which makes a new list of sites from similar profiles to the user. The final list of recommendations is obtained by combining both lists in a weighted way, which depends on the level of curiosity of the user.

Specifically, for users with a lower level of curiosity a higher percentage of items from the CB recommendation list is used, and for those who have a higher level of curios-ity a higher percentage of items from recommendation lists based on CF is used.

Table 2 shows the relationship between the level of cu-riosity and the percentage of items of each list that is used in the hybrid system to build the final lists of recommen-dations. Let X  X  consider for instance a user with a level of curiosity  X 1 -A Little X ; the hybrid algorithm will create a new list with 80% of recommendation items from the CB list and 20% from the CF list, whose results will be ordered according to their estimated rating.

To derive the values presented in Table 2, we consider the premise of positive psychology stated by Peterson &amp; Selig-man [7], which says that curious people are willing to explore the unknown before judge it. Thus, curious people are not apathetic to uncertain things or new ideas. Face to unex-pected or unknown, the curious feel excited to seek, unveil, know. Therefore, curiosity and novelty often go hand in hand.
 Table 2: Weights Hybrid Recommendation System based on Curiosity
By applying this theory in recommendation systems, we realized that, the more curious an individual, the more will be his seek for sites different of those he already knows so the recommendation based on CF fits optimally in this situation. On the contrary, little curious people tend to visit the same or similar places, so the CB recommendation becomes the best option to those individuals.
This section summarizes the experiments we have per-formed in order to test our hybrid recommendation system. Given that we were interested in making some preliminary tests, only 26 out of 105 volunteers were asked to participate.
They received a recommendation of sites of South Amer-ica through photos, allowing us to meet two objectives: first, analysing the level of the satisfaction of volunteers regard-ing to the recommendation and second, comparing possible gains of the hybrid system we developed to traditional rec-ommendation systems. For this purpose, we developed an online system (Figure 3) called  X  X oints of Interest in Latin America X  which, integrated to the Flickr 2 platform, shows photos of sites of South America corresponding to the rec-ommended places.

By accessing the online system (through a web page), the three recommendation lists were presented to the users, with 3 photos of sites in each page (10 pages in total), and they could rate each sight as: Little Interesting, Moder-
Flickr &lt; https://www.flickr.com/ &gt; . Figure 3: Main page online system Points of Interest in Latin America ately Interesting and Extremely Interesting, according to their tastes. The system generates three lists of 10 recom-mendations for each volunteer, and the level of curiosity that we have considered is the one obtained by the CEI-II ques-tionnaire.

The first results we have obtained with real users are shown in Figure 4. It can be observed that both CB and CF techniques had 86 and 81 votes, respectively, of  X  X ninterest-ing X  recommendations, whereas the recommendation based on curiosity obtained only 76 votes, which represents a re-duction in the rejection rate of approximately a 18%. When analysing the second aspect,  X  X oderately Interesting, X  we can see that the curiosity-based recommended achieved a gain in relation to the CB technique of 20% and 25% com-pared to the CF technique, so an average gain of about 23% in relation to traditional recommendation systems. Finally the number of sites that the volunteers found  X  X xtremely Interesting X  remains stable regardless the recommendation system.

Therefore, we can conclude that the use of our hybrid recommender is able to increase the user satisfaction. In other words, the use of curiosity can aid recommendation systems to achieve better prediction rates and also decrease rejection rate if compared to traditional recommendation systems.
In this work, we have presented a curiosity-based recom-mendation system. By means of the data available in the social network Facebook, our system is able to measure the curiosity level of a given user and to provide recommenda-tions based on this level. In the experiments we performed, we proved that human curiosity defined in Psychology can aid recommendation systems to be more efficient.

Regarding to future researches, we intend to use a larger amount of personal characteristics by means of other data sources like the social networks Linkedin and Twitter, thus getting data like: history of previous jobs, skills, certifica-tions, courses, content of tweets, etc., always looking for variables which can identify the personal characteristics of the individuals.

We also intend to use the database from MyPersonality 3 project, which currently has approximately 4,000,000 indi-vidual Facebook profiles, so we could test the curiosity gen-erated models here. Finally, we will perform new exper-iments with a bigger amount of volunteers. We will also generate lists with different weights between the content-based and collaborative-filtering lists and, moreover, we will present the results (photos) in a scrambled way, so that the user is not influenced by the order in which they are shown.
