 Abstract In a 12-month project we have developed a new, register-diverse, 55-million-word bilingual corpus X  X he New Corpus for Ireland (NCI) X  X o support the creation of a new English-to-Irish dictionary. The paper describes the strategies we employed, and the solutions to problems encountered. We believe we have a good model for corpus creation for lexicography, and others may find it useful as a blueprint. The corpus has two parts, one Irish, the other Hiberno-English (English as spoken in Ireland). We describe its design, collection and encoding.

We describe its design, collection , and encoding .

A corpus is of optimal use to lexicographers if it is loaded into a corpus query tool which supports them in finding collocational and grammatical patterns. To that end the corpus must be grammatically analyzed. While suitable tools were available for English, they were not for Irish, so we extended work on an Irish lemmatizer, and developed a part-of-speech tagger and set of grammatical relation definitions for Irish.
