 This workshop presents the current status related to the design, development and evaluation of recommender systems in recommender systems for Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) to support learners with pers onalized learning resources and Moreover, it proposes a dataTEL ch allenge to obtain data sets from TEL applications that can be used to benchmark algorithms specifically for the TEL context.

The 1st Workshop on Recommender Systems for Technology Enhanced Learning (RecSysTEL) builds upon the tradition of a series of workshops 1 on i) Social Information Retrieval for Technology Enhanced Learning (SIRTEL 07-09), ii) Context-Aware Recommendation for Learning and iii) Towards User Modeling and Adaptive Systems for All (TUMAS-A 07-09) which share a common interest on Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) and it is jointly organized by ACM RecSys and EC-TEL conferences. TEL aims to design, develop and test socio-technical innovations that will support and enhance learni ng practices of individuals and organizations. Information retrieval is a pivotal activity in TEL, and the deployment of reco mmender systems has attracted increased interest during the past years. Recommendation methods, techni ques and systems open an interesting new approach to facilitate and support learning and teaching. The goal is to develop, deploy and evaluate systems that provide learners and teachers with meaningful guidance in order to help identify suitable learning resources from a potentially overwhelming variety of choices. The workshop combines research papers and system demos which address the following topics: i) user tasks to be supported by recommender systems in TEL, ii) requirements for the deployment of TEL recommender systems, iii) recommendation algorithms and systems for TEL and iv) evaluation criteria and methods for TEL recommender systems. Moreover, a dataTEL challenge has been proposed to cope with the need of public data sets from different TEL applications that allow researchers to develop new recommendation systems and compare them to other algorithms in given settings. TEL is a domain that provides very challenging research opportunities for the recommender system field. The challenge is partially supported by the STELLAR Network of Excellence.
