 H.3.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Retrieval models Keywords : Ontology, Information Access, e-Learn, DiLight Educating students on Digital Library (DL) research and practices has become an important course taught in many universities. Due to the rapid development of DL field and students X  diverse backgrounds and learning preferences, students face a steep learning curve when they try to grasp core concepts/topics and understand different DL views/ approaches. DiLight is an interactive, integrated and active e-learning environment. One of the goals of DiLight is to organi ze course-related materials into an ontology [1] to support students to learn DL related topics and complete their learning tasks quickly and easily. DiLight is built on top of DSpace 1 , a leading open-source digital repository system, to take advantage of DSpace X  X  powerful content management and search tools. Our demonstration will concentrate on DiLight X  X  ontology-based information access functions. DiLight X  X  ontology organizes DL topics and related course materials in a hierarchy with 50 types of relationships (e.g., belong to topic, illustrated by, and has problem ) (see Figure 1). To support students to access DL course materials, DiLight provides three ontology-based me thods: content-based browsing, ontology-based search, and associated recommendation. Content-based browsing. The ontology provides a visual presentation of the overall conceptual architecture about DL course topics. With 50 types of relationship provided in the ontology, students can navigate through the hierarchical structure, exploring or discovering internal semantic relationships among the course topics. Ontology-based search. Our ontology-based search provides two functions: 1) it utilizes its built-in inference engine to locate documents that are truly semantic related to the query terms, thus achieves more accurate or comprehensive results. 2) It also http://www.dspace.org
