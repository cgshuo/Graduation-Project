 In this paper, we provide an overview of the 3 rd International Workshop on Search and Mining User-generated Contents, held in conjunction with the 20 th ACM International Con-ference on Information and Knowledge Management. We present the motivation and goals of the workshop, and some statistics and details about accepted papers and keynotes. H.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Storage and Re-trieval; H.4 [ Information Systems ]: Information Systems Applications; I.2 [ Computing Methodologies ]: Artificial Intelligence; I.7 [ Computing Methodologies ]: Document and Text Processing Documentation, Experimentation, Algorithms user-generated contents, social media, data mining, text min-ing, opinion mining, information retrieval
Nowadays, the huge amount and variety of user generated contents available in the Web open a wide range of oppor-tunities to enhance information retrieval and e-commerce applications. Opinions and reviews about products, anno-tations and bookmarks on multimedia resources, and friend relations in social networks are just a few examples of per-sonal information sources to be exploited in order to both improve the user X  X  experience and increase the companies X  revenues in online search and commerce activities.
As in its previous editions, the 3 rd Workshop on Search and Mining User-generated Contents (SMUC 2011) aimed at becoming a multidisciplinary forum for researchers and prac-titioners that work on knowledge extraction, management and exploitation in Social Media, and belong to different, but complementary fields such as Web (content/structure/usage) mining, information retrieval, opinion mining and sentiment analysis, user modeling, personalization and recommenda-tion, and multimedia processing and retrieval.

In SMUC 2011 workshop, we identify four main research themes into which the above research problems can be cat-egorized: Searching in Social Media, Mining Social Media, Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis, and Multimedia Processing and Retrieval. For all of them, we are inter-ested in developing and testing intelligent systems and ap-plications, involving innovative research from the fields of user modeling, personalization, recommendation, informa-tion visualization, and business intelligence, to name a few. Different research lines, backgrounds, perspectives and de-grees of expertise were presented at the workshop, and thus very interesting multidisciplinary discussions, collaborations and work synergies between the workshop attendees were expected as main outcomes of the event.
The SMUC 2011 workshop received a total of 17 submis-sions, 12 from Europe, 3 from Asia and 2 from North Amer-ica. Out of these, 11 (65%) were accepted as full papers.
Categorizing the submissions according to the main topics of the workshop yields the following distribution: seven pa-pers focus on data/text mining, five papers focus on search, information filtering and recommender systems, three pa-pers are related to multimedia mining, and two papers ad-dress opinion mining topics.

Another categorization of the papers can be considered based on the different information sources used for experi-mentation. Twitter represents by far the most popular in-formation source among contributions as five of the accepted papers rely on the microblogging service. Another two pa-pers use multimedia sources like Flickr, TV and YouTube, and the remaining papers make use of Wikipedia, product reviews web sites, SMS, and other sources.

The following are the papers presented at SMUC 2011 workshop:  X   X  X  X  X  Eating a Sandwich in Glasgow: Modeling Lo-cations with Tweets X  [4] describes an interesting ap-proach, tested on a large dataset, for locating tweets based on language modeling.
Three invited speakers presented very interesting talks about main topics of SMUC 2011 workshop: information retrieval, opinion mining, and social network and commu-nity analysis in Social Media.
