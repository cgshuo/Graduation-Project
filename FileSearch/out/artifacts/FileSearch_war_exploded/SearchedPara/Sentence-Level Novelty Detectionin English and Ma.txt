 Nowadays, it becomes more and more convenient to find relevant information regarding a certain topic. With the development of Internet and information technology, lots of information sources are now available such as news articles, scientific papers, blogs, forums, etc. The bloom of information brings us rich useful information as well as many redundant information. People who are in-terested in a certain topic may read similar or even duplicate information over and over again. To solve this problem, a novelty detection system can be designed to retrieve only novel information regarding a certain topic. Novel information refers to documents or sentences that contain fresh content, and novelty detec-tion (ND) is the process of singling out novel information from a given set of text documents. An automatic ND system consists of three main modules: (i) preprocessing, (ii) categorization, and (iii) novelty detection. The first module preprocesses the text documents by removing stop words and performing auto-matic stemming. Categorization classifies each incoming document or sentence into its relevant topic bin. Then, within each topic bin containing a group of rele-vant documents or sentences, the ND module searches through the time sequence of documents or sentences and retrieves only those with  X  X ovel X  information.
The pioneer work for ND was contributed by [16]. This paper gave the defi-nition of  X  X ovelty X  which was the opposite to  X  X edundancy X . A document that was less similar to its history documents was regarded as more  X  X ovel X . [16] introduced ND at the document level. To serve users better, it could be more helpful to further highlight novel information at the sentence level [2]. Later studies focused on sentence-level ND, such as those reported in TREC 2002-2004 Novelty Tracks [12][14][13], which compared various novelty metrics [2][17], and integrated various natural language techniques [15][9][6]. This paper also focuses on sentence-level ND, which is the Task 2 of the TREC 2003/2004 Nov-elty Track. In this task, one needs to identify all novel sentences from groups of relevant sentences in all documents.

Although previous ND studies have been conducted on the English language, to best of our knowledge, no ND studies have been reported for Malay. This issue is important because there are many documents with a mixture of both English and Malay languages. The Malay language is spoken by more than 20 million people residing in the Malay Peninsula, southern Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, and Indonesia [7]. If a ND algorithm is tuned for the English language, is it necessary to develop a different ND algorithm to process documents of other languages such as Malay? This paper attempts to answer this question by investigating multilingual ND on both English and Malay documents.

If the documents were written in English, preprocessing steps are needed before applying the ND algorithm on Malay documents. Preprocessing steps includes language translation to Malay, Malay stop words removal, and Malay word stemming. Each of these steps will be discussed in detail in this paper.
For this paper, a list of Malay stop words is proposed and an adapted Malay stemming algorithm is introduced. After employing the Malay stop words and integrating the Malay stemming algorithm with the existing system, our ND system, which was originally developed for English sentences, can work well in detecting novel sentences in Malay.
 This paper is organized as follows. A novelty detection algorithm for the English language is described in Section 2. A Malay ND algorithm, including Malay stop words and Malay stemming algorithm is presented and explained in Section 3. In Section 4, experiments and results are presented and discussed. Section 5 concludes the paper. Novelty detection in English involves the following steps: 2.1 Given all relevant sentences in all documents, first all stop words are re-2.2 Next, remaining words are stemmed using Porter stemming algorithm [10]. 2.3 Finally, the novelty of each incoming sentence is determined using cosine The summary of novelty detection process in English is shown in Fig. 1.  X  X s it necessary to develop a new ND algorithm for non-English documents? X  This paper addresses the question by adapting the existing ND algorithm on non-English documents, such as Malay. To tackle this issue, all sentences in Eng-lish documents are first translated into Malay. Then, stop words are removed and the remaining words are stemmed. Lastly, novelty detection is carried out to retrieve all novel sentences. The overall process of ND in Malay can be seen in Fig. 2.
 3.1 Language Translation In this first step, all English sentences are translated to Malay. During this process, we investigated issues in machine (automatic) vs. manual translation. Testing was conducted using TREC 2003 Novelty Track data on topics N1, N2, and N3. These topics were translated using two methods. First, we used only machine translation EBMT (Example-Based Machine Translation) [5]. Next, we manually corrected the machine translation. The F-score, precision and recall were calculated for each of 3 topics, and averaged across the topics. We compared the ND results of the two translations, which are shown in Table 1. where S is the number of novel sentences selected by the novelty detection sys-tem; A is the number of novel sentences selected by the NIST assessor; and M is the number of matched novel sentences (number of novel sentences selected by both novelty detection system and NIST assessor). In TREC Novelty Track, the novel sentences marked by the NIST assessor is regarded as the truth. where F -Score represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
As shown in Table 1, the average results differ only slightly ( &lt; 1%) between machine and corrected translations. Since the results differed only slightly, we used machine translation for the remaining documents. 3.2 Stop Words Removal Since stop words are language dependent, different languages have different set of stop words. For this paper, a list of Malay stop words was generated. Some stop words were directly translated from English stop words, such as  X  X ach X  becomes  X  X etiap X ,  X  X fter X  becomes  X  X esudah X  and  X  X herefore X  becomes  X  X aka X . Some others were gathered from Malay documents, such as  X  X yuh X ,  X  X lamak X , and  X  X mboi X . A list of 216 Malay stop words used in this paper is shown in Table 2. 3.3 Malay Word Stemming Similar to stop words removal, word stemming is also language dependent. There-fore, each language has its own rules for stemming. In this section, a Malay word stemming algorithm is introduced.
 Algorithm The Malay stemming algorithm used in this paper is adapted from Abdullah [1] and Mangalam [8]. After some modifications, the flowchart is shown in Fig. 3.
In this flowchart, the difference between backward and forward stemming is the affixes (either prefixes or suffixes) which are stemmed first. In the backward stemming, suffixes are stemmed first, while in the forward stemming prefixes are stemmed first.
 Malay Affixes Mangalam [8] points out the affixes in Malay that need to be stemmed: Prefixes: me-, pe-, be-, ke-, se-, te-, di-Suffixes: -wati, -wan, -man, -nya, -lah, -kah, -kan, -pun, -ita, -ku, -mu, -an, -i Rules for Stemming Malay Words Ranaivo [11] explains the rules for stemming Malay words. Dual Word Conversion In Malay, plural forms of words are represented by their dual word forms, such as  X  X nak -anak X  (kids),  X  X urid -murid X  (students), etc. In this step, all plural words are converted to their singular forms. For example,  X  X ouses X  is represented as  X  X umah -rumah X  in Malay. Having undergone this step, the word  X  X umah -rumah X  becomes  X  X umah X  (house), which is the singular form of  X  X umah -rumah X . Prefix Rule 1: same prefix cannot occur more than once consecutively Rule 2: after prefix te-, or pe-, no more prefixes are possible Rule 3: prefix di-must appear first Rule 4: prefix di-and me-can never coexist Rule 5: prefix be-and te-can never coexist Rule 6: prefix me-and be-can never coexist Rule 7: prefix te-must appear after prefix me-Rule 8: prefix pe-must appear after prefix me-Rule 9: prefix be-, te-, me-and pe-Suffix Rule 1: suffix -i and -kan can never coexist Rule 2: suffix -wati, -wan, -man, and -ita can never coexist with any prefixes Rule 3: suffix -kah and -kan can never coexist Rule 4: suffix -lah and -kan can never coexist Rule 5: suffix -an and -kan can never coexist Rule 6: suffix -i and -an can never coexist First Letter Modification After taking out all prefixes and suffixes, each resulting word needs to be checked for its first letter.
 Rule 1: if the first letter is  X  X  X , then change it to  X  X  X  or  X  X  X  Rule 2: if the first letter is  X  X  X , then change it to  X  X  X  Rule 3: if the first letter is  X  X  X , then change it to  X  X  X  Check for Overstemming Rule 1: if the last prefix truncated is me-and first letter of the resulting word is  X  X  X , then check the word against dictionary by changing the first letter  X  X  X  with  X  X y X . If the word is found in the dictionary, then overstemming has occurred. Rule 2: if the last suffix truncated is -kan, then check the word against the dictionary by adding  X  X  X  at the end. If by adding the letter  X  X  X  results in a root word, then overstemming has occurred.
 Drawback One drawback of this algorithm is that the algorithm relies heavily on the dictio-nary to check for root words. Therefore, in order to improve the performance we need to compile a  X  X omplete X  list of Malay root words. Currently, the dictionary consists of 5300 Malay root words. Those words were taken from Bhanot X  X  Malay -English dictionary [3].
At the end of stemming process, a list of root words for each sentence is generated. 3.4 Novel Sentence Detection The last step of the ND process in Malay is novel sentence detection. This step is exactly the same as Section 2.3 of the ND process in the English language. After this step, a list of novel sentences is retrieved and the novelty detection process in Malay ends. This paper used TREC 2003 and TREC 2004 Novelty Track data as the exper-imental data. TREC 2003 Novelty Track data consists of 50 topics (N1 -N50) and TREC 2004 Novelty Track data also consists of 50 topics (N51 -N100). The summary of these data is given in Table. 3.

In this experimental study, the focus was on novelty detection rather than relevant sentence categorization. Therefore, our experiments started with given all relevant sentences, from which the novel sentences were identified.
All sentences were originally written in English. We followed the novelty de-tection steps as described in Section 3 on the datasets to retrieve a list of Malay novel sentences. The cosine similarity novelty metric was employed and the threshold of novelty scores was predefined in a range from 0.05 to 0.95 with a step value of 0.10. The total of 40 runs were performed for both English and Malay on TREC 2003/2004 Novelty Track data. For each run (or each thresh-old), precision and recall (Eq. (3)) for each topic were calculated and the average precision and recall over 50 topics were plotted.

In information retrieval, precision-recall (PR) curves are always used to com-pare algorithms, where the algorithm with larger area under the curve is regarded as a better algorithm. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 shows the PR curves of the English ver-sion vs. Malay version ND system on both TREC 2003 (Fig. 4) and TREC 2004 (Fig. 5) Novelty Track data. From these figures, we observe that the results of Malay ND is only slightly lower than English ND in the TREC 2003 Novelty Track data (with the average precision loss of 0.77% and the average recall loss of 0.96%), and is very similar in the TREC 2004 Novelty Track data (with the average precision loss of 0.09% and the average of recall loss of 0.16%). The average precision and recall loss is the percentage difference of average precision and recall between English and Malay over all thresholds.

These experimental results indicate that, except for using different stop word lists and word stemming algorithms, the ND algorithm designed for the English language also performs well in detecting novel sentences in Malay. Sentence-level novelty detection (ND) is a process of retrieving novel sentences from a stream of incoming documents, based on a user X  X  history and preferences. In this paper, we focused on Task 2 of the TREC 2003/2004 Novelty Track to identify all novel sentences, given the relevant sentences in all documents. The document sets in the Novelty Track were all in the English language; thus, the corresponding ND algorithms were all designed for the English language. This paper addressed the issues involved in adapting existing ND algorithms for non-English languages such as Malay, which, to best of our knowledge, had not been previously studied.

Since the existing Novelty Track data is in English, in order to try the exist-ing algorithms for documents in Malay, we first translated all relevant sentences using the EBMT (Example-Based Machine Translation) tool. Next, all Malay stop words from the translated sentences were removed, and the remaining words were converted into their basic forms using automatic Malay word stemming. Af-ter these preprocessing steps, the existing ND algorithm was performed on the resulting Malay sentences, and compared the results with original English sen-tences. The results show that by replacing English stop words with our proposed Malay stop words and English stemming algorithm with our adapted Malay stemming algorithm, existing ND algorithms that were originally developed for English can also be used for Malay sentences, without much loss in precision ( &lt; 1%) and recall ( &lt; 1%). Therefore, this paper shows that by replacing the language-specific processes (stop words and stemming), existing ND algorithms appear to be robust in detecting novel sentences in the Malay language, and can possibly be extended to other alphabet-based languages.
