 There has been a huge interest in the automatic identification and extraction of opinions from free text in recent years. Opinion mining spans a va-riety of subtasks including: creating opinion word lexicons (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Ding et al., 2008), identifying opinion expressions (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Fahrni and Klenner, 2008), identi-fying polarities of opinions in context (Breck et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2005), extracting opinion targets (Hu and Liu, 2004; Zhuang et al., 2006; Cheng and Xu, 2008) and opinion holders (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Choi et al., 2005).

Data-driven approaches for extracting opinion expressions, their holders and targets require re-liably annotated data at the expression level. In previous research, expression level annotation of opinions was extensively investigated on newspa-per articles (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson and Wiebe, 2005; Wilson, 2008b) and on meeting dialogs (So-masundaran et al., 2008; Wilson, 2008a).

Compared to the newspaper and meeting dialog genres, little corpus-based work has been carried out for interpreting the opinions and evaluations in user-generated discourse. Due to the high popular-ity of Web 2.0 communities 1 , the amount of user-generated discourse and the interest in the analysis of such discourse has increased over the last years. To the best of our knowledge, there are two cor-pora of user-generated discourse which are anno-tated for opinion related information at the expres-sion level: The corpus of Hu &amp; Liu (2004) consists of customer reviews about consumer electronics, and the corpus of Zhuang et al. (2006) consists of movie reviews. Both corpora are tailored for ap-plication specific needs, therefore, do not contain certain related information explicitly annotated in the discourse, which we consider important (see Section 2). Furthermore, none of these works pro-vide inter-annotator agreement studies.

Our goal is to create sentence and expression level annotated corpus of customer reviews which fulfills the following requirements: (1) It filters individual sentences regarding their topic rele-vancy and the existence of an opinion or factual information which implies an evaluation. (2) It identifies opinion expressions including the re-spective opinion target, opinion holder, modi-fiers, and anaphoric expressions if applicable. (3) The semantic orientation of the opinion expres-sion is identified while considering negation, and the opinion expression is linked to the respective holder and target in the discourse. Such a re-source would (i) enable novel applications of opin-ion mining such as a fine-grained identification of opinion properties, e.g. opinion modification de-tection including negation, and (ii) enhance opin-ion target extraction and the polarity assignment by linking the opinion expression with its target and providing anaphoric resolutions in discourse.
We present an annotation scheme which fulfills the mentioned requirements, an inter-annotator agreement study, and discuss our observations. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the related work. In Sections 3, we describe the annotation scheme. Section 4 presents the data and the annotation study, while Section 5 summarizes the main conclusions. 2.1 Newspaper Articles and Meeting Dialogs Most prominent work concerning the expres-sion level annotation of opinions is the Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) corpus 2 (Wiebe et al., 2005). It was extended several times over the last years, either by adding new docu-ments or annotating new types of opinion related information (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005; Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008; Wilson, 2008b). The MPQA annotation scheme builds upon the private state notion (Quirk et al., 1985) which describes men-tal states including opinions, emotions, specula-tions and beliefs among others. The annotation scheme strives to represent the private states in terms of their functional components (i.e. expe-riencer holding an attitude towards a target ). It consists of frames ( direct subjective, expressive subjective element, objective speech event, agent, attitude, and target frames ) with slots represent-ing various attributes and properties (e.g. intensity, nested source ) of the private states.

Wilson (2008a) adapts and extends the concepts from the MPQA scheme to annotate subjective content in meetings (AMI corpus), and creates the AMIDA scheme. Besides subjective utterances, the AMIDA scheme contains objective polar ut-terances which annotates evaluations without ex-pressing explicit opinion expressions.

Somasundaran et al. (2008) proposes opinion frames for representing discourse level associa-tions in meeting dialogs. The annotation scheme focuses on two types of opinions, sentiment and arguing . It annotates the opinion expression and target spans. The link and link type attributes asso-ciate the target with other targets in the discourse through same or alternative relations. The opinion frames are built based on the links between tar-gets. Somasundaran et al. (2008) show that opin-ion frames enable a coherent interpretation of the opinions in discourse and discover implicit evalu-ations through link transitivity.

Similar to Somasundaran et al. (2008), Asher et al. (2008) performs discourse level analysis of opinions. They propose a scheme which first iden-tifies and assigns categories to the opinion seg-ments as reporting, judgment, advice, or senti-ment ; and then links the opinion segments with each other via rhetorical relations including con-trast, correction, support, result , or continuation . However, in contrast to our scheme and other schemes, instead of marking expression bound-aries without any restriction they annotate an opin-ion segment only if it contains an opinion word from their lexicon, or if it has a rhetorical relation to another opinion segment. 2.2 User-generated Discourse The two annotated corpora of user-generated con-tent and their corresponding annotation schemes are far less complex. Hu &amp; Liu (2004) present a dataset of customer reviews for consumer elec-tronics crawled from amazon.com. The follow-ing example shows two annotations taken from the corpus of Hu &amp; Liu (2004): The corpus provides only target and polarity anno-tations, and do not contain opinion expression or opinion modifier annotations which lead to these polarity scores. The annotation scheme allows the annotation of implicit features (indicated with the the attribute [u] ). Implicit features are not re-solved to any actual product feature instances in discourse. In fact, the actual positions of the prod-uct features (or any anaphoric references to them) are not explicitly marked in the discourse, i.e, it is unclear to which mention of the feature the opin-ion refers to.

In their paper on movie review mining and sum-marization, Zhuang et al. (2006) introduce an an-notated corpus of movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The corpus is annotated regard-ing movie features and corresponding opinions. The following example shows an annotated sen-tence: The movie features ( Fword ) are attributed to one of 20 predefined categories (Ftype). The opin-ion words ( Oword ) and their semantic orientations ( Otype ) are identified. Possible negations are di-rectly reflected by the semantic orientation, but not explicitly labeled in the sentence. (PD) in the fol-lowing example indicates that the movie feature is referenced by anaphora: However, similar to the corpus of Hu &amp; Liu (2004) the referring pronouns are not explicitly marked in discourse. It is therefore neither possible to au-tomatically determine which pronoun creates the link if there are more than one in a sentence, nor it is denoted which antecedent, i.e. the actual men-tion of the feature in the discourse it relates to. 3.1 Opinion versus Polar Facts The goal of the annotation scheme is to capture the evaluations regarding the topics being discussed in the consumer reviews. The evaluations in con-sumer reviews are either explicit expressions of opinions, or facts which imply evaluations as dis-cussed below.
 Explicit expressions of opinions: Opinions are private states (Wiebe et al., 2005; Quirk et al., 1985) which are not open to objective observation or verification. In this study, we focus on the opin-ions stating the quality or value of an entity, ex-perience or a proposition from one X  X  perspective. (1) illustrates an example of an explicit expression of an opinion. Similar to Wiebe et al. (2005), we view opinions in terms of their functional compo-nents, as opinion holders , e.g., the author in (1), holding attitudes ( polarity ), e.g., negative attitude indicated with the word nightmare , towards possi-ble targets , e.g., Capella University . Facts implying evaluations: Besides opinions, there are facts which can be objectively verified, but still imply an evaluation of the quality or value of an entity or a proposition. For instance, con-sider the snippet below: The example above provides an evaluation about the professors without stating any explicit expres-sions of opinions. We call such objectively verifi-able, but evaluative sentences polar facts . Explicit expressions of opinions typically contain specific cues, i.e. opinion words, loaded with a positive or negative connotation (e.g., nightmare ). Even when they are taken out of the context in which they ap-pear, they evoke an evaluation. However, evalu-ations in polar facts can only be inferred within the context of the review. For instance, the targets of the implied evalution in the polar facts (2), (3) and (4) are the professors. However, (3) may have been perceived as a positive statement if the re-view was explaining how good the fellow students were or how the course enforced team work etc. The annotation scheme consists of two levels. First, the sentence level scheme analyses each sen-tence in terms of (i) its relevancy to the overall topic of the review, and (ii) whether it contains an evaluation (an opinion or a polar fact ) about the topic. Once the on-topic sentences contain-ing evaluations are identified, the expression level scheme first focuses either on marking the text spans of the opinion expressions (if the sentence contains an explicit expression of an opinion) or marking the targets of the polar facts (if the sen-tence is a polar fact ). Upon marking an opin-ion expression span, the target and holder of the opinion is marked and linked to the marked opin-ion expression. Furthermore, the expression level scheme allows assigning polarities to the marked opinion expression spans and targets of the polar facts .

The following subsections introduce the sen-tence and the expression level annotation schemes in detail with examples. 3.2 Sentence Level Annotation The sentence annotation strives to identify the sen-tences containing evaluations about the topic. In consumer reviews people occasionally drift off the actual topic being reviewed. For instance, as in (5) taken from a review about an online university, they tend to provide information about their back-ground or other experiences.
Figure 1: The sentence level annotation scheme Such sentences do not provide information about the actual topic, but typically serve for justifying the user X  X  point of view or provide a better under-standing about her circumstances. However, they are not valuable for an application aiming to ex-tract opinions about a specific topic.

Reviews given to the annotators contain meta information stating the topic, for instance, the name of the university or the service being re-viewed. A markable (i.e. an annotation unit) is created for each sentence prior to the annotation process. At this level, the annotation process is therefore a sentence labeling task. The annotators are able to see the whole review, and instructed to label sentences in the context of the whole review. Figure 1 presents the sentence level scheme. At-tribute names are marked with oval circles and the possible values are given in parenthesis. The fol-lowing attributes are used: topic relevant attribute is labeled as yes if the sentence discusses the given topic itself or its as-pects, properties or features as in examples (1)-(4). Other possible values for this attribute include none given which can be chosen in the absence of meta data, or no if the sentence drifted off the topic as in example (5). opinionated attribute is labeled as yes if the sentence contains any explicit expressions of opin-ions about the given topic. This attribute is pre-sented if the topic relevant attribute has been la-beled as none given or yes . In other words, only the on-topic sentences are considered in this step. Examples (6)-(8) illustrate examples labeled as topic relevant=yes and opinionated=yes . polar fact attribute is labeled as yes if the sen-tence is a polar fact . This attribute is presented if the opinionated attribute has been labeled as no . Examples (2)-(4) demonstrate sentences la-beled as topic relevant=yes, opinionated=no and polar fact=yes . polar fact polarity attribute represents the po-larity of the evaluation in a polar fact sentence. The possible values for this attribute include posi-tive, negative, both . The value both is intended for the polar fact sentences containing more than one evaluation with contradicting polarities. At the expression level analysis, the targets of the con-tradicting polar fact evaluations are identified dis-tinctly and assigned polarities of positive or neg-ative later on. Examples (9)-(11) demonstrate ex-amples of polar fact sentences with different val-ues of the attribute polar fact polarity . 3.3 Expression Level Annotation At the expression level, we focus on the topic relevant sentences containing evaluations, i.e., sentences labeled as topic relevant=yes, opinion-ated=yes or topic relevant=yes, opinionated=no, polar fact=yes . If the sentence is a polar fact , then the aim is to mark the target and label the polarity of the evaluation. If the sentence is opinionated, then, the aim is to mark the opinion expression span, and label its polarity and strength (i.e. in-tensity), and to link it to the target and the holder. Figure 2 presents the expression level scheme. At this stage, annotators mark text spans, and are allowed to assign one of the five labels to the marked span:
The polar target is used to label the targets of the evaluations implied by polar facts . The is-Reference attribute labels polar targets which are anaphoric references. The polar target polarity Figure 2: The expression level annotation scheme attribute is used to label the polarity as positive or negative . If the isReference attribute is labeled as true , then the referent attribute appears which enables the annotator to resolve the reference to its antecedent. Consider the example sentences (12) and (13) below. The polar target in (13), written bold, is labeled as isReference=true , po-lar target polarity=negative . To resolve the ref-erence, annotator first creates another polar target markable for the antecedent, namely the bold text span in (12), then, links the antecedent to the ref-erent attribute of the polar target in (13).
The target annotation represents what the opin-ion is about. Both polar targets and targets can be the topic of the review or different aspects, i.e. fea-tures of the topic. Similar to the polar targets , the isReference attribute allows the identification of the targets which are anaphoric references and the referent attribute links them to their antecedents in the discourse. Bold span in (14) shows an example of a target in an opinionated sentence.
The holder type represents the holder of an opinion in the discourse and is labeled in the same manner as the targets and polar targets . In con-sumer reviews, holders are most of the time the authors of the reviews. To ease the annotation pro-cess, the holder is not labeled when this is the au-thor.

The modifier annotation labels the lexical items, such as not, very, hardly etc. , which affect the strength of an opinion or shift its polarity. Upon creation of a modifier markable, annotators are asked to choose between negation, increase, de-crease for identifying the influence of the modifier on the opinion. For instance, the marked span in (15) is labeled as modifier=increase as it gives the impression that the author is really offended by the negative comments about her university.
The opinionexpression annotation is used to la-bel the opinion terms in the sentence. This mark-able type has five attributes, three of which, i.e., modifier , holder , and target are pointer attributes to the previously defined markable types. The po-larity attribute assesses the semantic orientation of the attitude, where the strength attribute marks the intensity of this attitude. The polarity and strength attributes focus solely on the marked opinionex-pression span, not the whole evaluation implied in the sentence. For instance, the opinionexpres-sion span in (16) is labeled as polarity=negative, strength=average . We infer the polarity of the evaluation only after considering the modifier, po-larity and the strength attributes together. In (16), the evaluation about the target is strongly negative after considering all three attributes of the opinion-expression annotation. In (17), the polarity of the opinionexpression1 itself ( complaints ) is labeled as negative . It is linked to the modifier1 which is labeled as negation . Target1 ( PhD journey ) is linked to the opinionexpression1 . The overall eval-uation regarding the target1 is positive after ap-plying the affect of the modifier1 to the polarity of the opinionexpression1 , i.e., after negating the negative polarity.
Finally, Figure 3 demonstrates all expression level markables created for an opinionated sen-tence and how they relate to each other.
Figure 3: Expression level annotation example Each review has been annotated by two annotators independently according to the annotation scheme introduced above. We used the freely available MMAX2 4 annotation tool capable of stand-off multi-level annotations. Annotators were native speaker linguistic students. They were trained on 15 reviews after reading the annotation manual. 5 In the training stage, the annotators discussed with each other if different decisions have been made and were allowed to ask questions to clarify their understanding of the scheme. Annotators had ac-cess to the review text as a whole while making their decisions. 4.1 Data The corpus consists of consumer reviews col-lected from the review portals rateitall 6 and eopin-ions 7 . It contains reviews from two domains in-cluding online universities, e.g., Capella Univer-sity, Pheonix, University of Maryland University College etc. and online services, e.g., PayPal, egroups, eTrade, eCircles etc. These two domains were selected with the project-relevant, domain-specific research goals in mind. We selected a spe-cific topic, e.g. Pheonix, if there were more than 3 reviews written about it. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics regarding the data.

We used 118 reviews containing 1151 sentences from the university domain for measuring the sen-tence and expression level agreements. In the fol-lowing subsections, we report the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) at each level.
Table 1: Descriptive statistics about the corpus 4.2 Sentence Level Agreement Sentence level markables were already created au-tomatically prior to the annotation, i.e., the set of annotation units were the same for both annota-tors. We use Cohen X  X  kappa (  X  ) (Cohen, 1960) for measuring the IAA. The sentence level anno-tation scheme has a hierarchical structure. A new attribute is presented based on the decision made for the previous attribute, for instance, opinionated attribute is only presented if the topic relevant at-tribute is labeled as yes or none given ; polar fact attribute is only presented if the opinionated at-tribute is labeled as no etc. We calculate  X  for each attribute considering only the markables which were labeled the same by both annotators in the previously required step. Table 2 shows the  X  val-ues for each attribute, the size of the markable set on which the value was calculated, and the per-centage agreement.
 Table 2: Sentence level inter-annotator agreement
The agreement for topic relevancy shows that it is possible to label this attribute reliably. The sentences labeled as topic relevant by both anno-tators correspond to 59% of all sentences, suggest-ing that people often drift off the topic in consumer reviews. This is usually the case when they pro-vide information about their backgrounds or alter-natives to the given topic.

On the other hand, we obtain moderate agree-ment levels for the opinionated and polar fact at-tributes. 62% of the topic relevant sentences were labeled as opinionated by at least one annotator, and the rest 38% constitute the topic relevant sen-tences labeled as not opinionated by both anno-tators. Nonetheless, they still contain evaluations ( polar facts ), as 15% of the topic relevant sen-tences were labeled as polar facts by both anno-tators. When we merge the attributes opinionated and polar fact into a single category, we obtain  X  of 0.75 and a percentage agreement of 87%. Thus, we conclude that opinion-relevant sentences, ei-ther in the form of an explicit expression of opin-ion or a polar fact , can be labeled reliably in con-sumer reviews. However, there is a thin border be-tween polar facts and explicit expressions of opin-ions.

To the best of our knowledge, similar annotation efforts on consumer or movie reviews do not pro-vide any agreement figures for direct comparison. However, Wiebe et al. (2005) present an annota-tion study where they mark textual spans for sub-jective expressions in a newspaper corpus. They report pairwise  X  values for three annotators rang-ing between 0.72 -0.84 for the sentence level sub-jective/objective judgments. Wiebe et al. (2005) mark subjective spans, and do not explicitly per-form the sentence level labeling task. They calcu-late the sentence level  X  values based on the ex-istence of a subjective expression span in the sen-tence. Although the task definitions, approaches and the corpora have quite disparate characteris-tics in both studies, we obtain comparable results when we merge opinionated and polar fact cate-gories. 4.3 Expression Level Agreement At the expression level, annotators focus only on the sentences which were labeled as opinionated or polar fact by both annotators. Annotators were instructed to mark text spans, and then, assign them the annotation types such as polar target, opinionexpression etc. (see Figure 2). For calcu-lating the text span agreement, we use the agree-ment metric presented by Wiebe et al. (2005) and Somasundaran et al. (2008). This metric corre-sponds to the precision (P) and recall (R) metrics in information retrieval where the decisions of one annotator are treated as the system; the decisions of the other annotator are treated as the gold stan-dard; and the overlapping spans correspond to the correctly retrieved documents.

Somasundaran et al. (2008) present a discourse level annotation study in which opinion and tar-get spans are marked and linked with each other in a meeting transcript corpus. Following Soma-sundaran et al. (2008), we compute three differ-ent measures for the text span agreement: (i) exact matching in which the text spans should perfectly match; (ii) lenient (relaxed) matching in which the overlap between spans is considered as a match, and (iii) subset matching in which a span has to be contained in another span in order to be consid-ered as a match. 8 Agreement naturally increases as we relax the matching constraints. However, there were no differences between the lenient and the subset agreement values. Therefore, we report only the exact and lenient matching agreement re-sults for each annotation type in Table 3. The same agreement results for the lenient and subset matching indicates that inexact matches are still very similar to each other, i.e., at least one span is totally contained in the other.
 Somasundaran et al. (2008) do not report any F-measure. However, they report span agreement results in terms of precision and recall ranging between 0.44 -0.87 for opinion spans and be-tween 0.74 -0.90 for the target spans. Wiebe et al. (2005) use the lenient matching approach for reporting text span agreements ranging between 0.59 -0.81 for subjective expressions. We ob-tain higher agreement values for both opinion ex-pression and target spans. We attribute this to the fact that the annotators look for opinion expression and target spans within the opinionated sentences which they agreed upon. Sentence level analysis indeed increases the reliability at the expression level. Compared to the high agreement on mark-ing target spans, we obtain lower agreement val-ues on marking polar target spans. We observe that it is easier to attribute explicit expressions of evaluations to topic relevant entities compared to attributing evaluations implied by experiences to specific topic relevant entities in the reviews.
We calculated the agreement on identifying anaphoric references using the method introduced in (Passonneau, 2004) which utilizes Krippen-dorf X  X   X  (Krippendorff, 2004) for computing reli-ability for coreference annotation. We considered the overlapping target and polar target spans to-gether in this calculation, and obtained an  X  value of 0.29. Compared to Passonneau (  X  values from 0.46 to 0.74), we obtain a much lower agreement value. This may be due to the different definitions and organizations of the annotation tasks. Passon-neau requires prior marking of all noun phrases (or instances which needs to be processed by the an-notator). Annotator X  X  task is to identify whether an instance refers to another marked entity in the discourse, and then, to identify corefering entity chains. However, in our annotation process anno-tators were tasked to identify only one entity as the referent, and was free to choose it from anywhere in the discourse. In other words, our chains con-tain only one entity. It is possible that both annota-tors performed correct resolutions, but still did not overlap with each other, as they resolve to differ-ent instances of the same entity in the discourse. We plan to further investigate reference resolution annotation discrepancies and perform corrections in the future.

Some annotation types require additional at-tributes to be labeled after marking the span. For instance, upon marking a text span as a po-lar target or an opinionexpression , one has to la-bel the polarity and strength . We consider the overlapping spans for each annotation type and use  X  for reporting the agreement on these at-tributes. Table 4 shows the  X  values.
 Table 4: Inter-annotator agreement at the expres-sion level
We observe that the strength of the opinionex-pression and the polar target polarity cannot be labeled as reliably as the polarity of the opinion-expression . 61% of the agreed upon polar targets were labeled as negative by both annotators. On the other hand, only 35% of the agreed upon opin-ionexpressions were labeled as negative by both annotators. There were no neutral instances. This indicates that reviewers tend to report negative ex-periences using polar facts, probably objectively describing what has happened, but report posi-tive experiences with explicit opinion expressions. Distribution of the strength attribute was as fol-lows: weak 6%, average 54%, and strong 40%. The majority of the modifiers were annotated as intensifiers (70%), while 20% of the modifiers were labeled as negation. 4.4 Discussion We analyzed the discrepancies in the annotations to gain insights about the challenges involved in various opinion related labeling tasks. At the sen-tence level, there were several trivial cases of dis-agreement, for instance, failing to recognize topic relevancy when the topic was not mentioned or referenced explicitly in the sentence, as in (18). Occasionally, annotators disagreed about whether a sentence that was written as a reaction to the other reviewers, as in (19), should be considered as topic relevant or not. Another source of dis-agreement included sentences similar to (20) and (21). One annotator interpreted them as univer-sally true statements regardless of the topic, while the other attributed them to the discussed topic.
Annotators easily distinguished the evaluations at the sentence level. However, they had diffi-culties distinguishing between a polar fact and an opinion. For instance, both annotators agreed that the sentences (22) and (23) contain evaluations re-garding the topic of the review. However, one an-notator interpreted both sentences as objectively verifiable facts giving a positive impression about the school, while the other one treated them as opinions.
Sentence level annotation increases the relia-bility of the expression level annotation in terms of marking text spans. However, annotators of-ten had disagreements on labeling the strength at-tribute. For instance, one annotator labeled the opinion expression in (24) as strong , while the other one labeled it as average . We observe that it is not easy to identify trivial causes of disagree-ments regarding strength as its perception by each individual is highly subjective. However, most of the disagreements occurred between weak and av-erage cases.
We did not apply any consolidation steps during our agreement studies. However, a final version of the corpus will be produced by the third judge (one of the co-authors) by consolidating the judgements of the two annotators. We presented a corpus of consumer reviews from the rateitall and eopinions websites annotated with opinion related information. Existing opin-ion annotated user-generated corpora suffer from several limitations which result in difficulties for interpreting the experimental results and for per-forming error analysis. To name a few, they do not explicitly link the functional components of the opinions like targets, holders, or modifiers with the opinion expression; some of them do not mark opinion expression spans, none of them resolves anaphoric references in discourse. Therefore, we introduced a two level annotation scheme consist-ing of the sentence and expression levels, which overcomes the limitations of the existing review corpora. The sentence level annotation labels sen-tences for (i) relevancy to a given topic, and (ii) expressing an evaluation about the topic. Similar to (Wilson, 2008a), our annotation scheme allows capturing evaluations made with factual (objec-tive) sentences. The expression level annotation further investigates on-topic sentences containing evaluations for pinpointing the properties (polar-ity, strength), and marking the functional com-ponents of the evaluations (opinion terms, modi-fiers, targets and holders), and linking them within a discourse. We applied the annotation scheme to the consumer review genre and presented an extensive inter-annotator study providing insights to the challenges involved in various opinion re-lated labeling tasks in consumer reviews. Simi-lar to the MPQA scheme, which is successfully applied to the newspaper genre, the annotation scheme treats opinions and evaluations as a com-position of functional components and it is eas-ily extendable. Therefore, we hypothesize that the scheme can also be applied to other genres with minor extensions or as it is. Finally, the corpus and the annotation manual will be made available at http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/ research/data/sentiment-analysis .
