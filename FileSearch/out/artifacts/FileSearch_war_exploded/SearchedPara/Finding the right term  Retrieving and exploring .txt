One mechanism to overcome the identified problems is to use a controlled vocabulary . sources with, and enables vocabulary aware applications to enhance the user experience by exploiting the relationships be-tween concepts in the vocabulary, which define a poly-hierarchical structure. It is anticipated that vocabulary aware rently marked with keywords drawn from an existing vocabulary. If the metadata stored about these articles were linked using the extract images of the objects discussed in the article.

A first step to support these vocabulary enabled applications is to develop techniques for converting a user entered string tagging, e.g. Marlow, Naaman, Boyd, and Davis (2006), Chirita, Costache, Nejdl, and Handschuh (2007) . However, our aim is to assist users to discover the correct concepts to describe or locate a given resource, by showing how various concepts are defined and related across multiple controlled vocabularies.

In this paper, we present our work on the Vocabulary Explorer, a Web service that enables the user to discover vocabulary concepts and navigate the relationships between concepts both within and across vocabularies. This required developing a mechanism to search for vocabulary concepts given a set of search words. The search mechanism uses the Terrier Informa-the poor results returned by the initial versions of the Vocabulary Explorer we developed a test collection using one of the vocabularies: an example of applying Information Retrieval evaluation techniques to Semantic Web technology. The test col-lection was used to investigate the capabilities of existing document weighting models, and the effects of term weighting and query expansion, for identifying the correct vocabulary concept. In Section 2 we discuss controlled vocabularies and their encoding into SKOS . Section 3 describes our experiences developing the Vocabulary Explorer for semantic vocabularies.
The effects of different weighting models and query adaption techniques on this search task are presented in Section 4. Re-lated work is discussed in Section 5 and our conclusions are given in Section 6. 2. Vocabularies
Vocabularies are a mechanism to formalise the terminology used within a domain of discourse and the semantic relation-ships between those terms (see for example BS8723, 2005 ). Typically, a vocabulary is developed to: (i) limit the available terms used and (ii) provide consensus on the meaning of the terms. A vocabulary contains a set of concepts each of which captures the preferred label, alternative labels, definition, and notes about one term in the domain. Additionally, the con-cepts of a vocabulary may be related to one another in a variety of ways: a concept c term ( c 2 is more general), a narrower term ( c 2 is more specific), or a related term ( c should be noted that the broader/narrower properties do not prescribe a subsumption relationship, but are given the oper-ational definition that any resource retrieved via a given term would also be retrieved via its broader term.
The Simple Knowledge Organisation System ( SKOS )(Miles &amp; Bechhofer, 2009 ) is a mechanism to share taxonomies, the-sauri, and vocabularies, in a machine understandable way particularly aimed at the (Semantic) Web. Information about a nomical concept of a planet X  X  moon expressed in the Turtle
Moon and Titan are narrower concepts. Expressing vocabulary concepts in RDF allows an information system to appear to  X  X  X nderstand X  the concepts since it can explore the relationships between them and make inferences based on these relationships.
 One can view a vocabulary as an ontology and may wish to express it using the Web Ontology Language ( does not match the implied semantics when a user is searching for information. For example, the concept bank account would
This looser  X  X  X arrower term X  notion of a vocabulary, where a narrower term is not necessarily a specialisation of the more general term, matches the experience of users searching for information, and are the semantics offered by limits the information that may be inferred from the vocabularies, it makes them cheaper to develop and maintain.
Within the domain of astronomy, there exist many vocabularies published by a variety of organisations. Each vocabulary example, the journal keywords vocabulary is used to tag research articles with descriptions of their content in order to aid retrieval. The Virtual Observatory is using SKOS to formalise these existing and future vocabularies, summarised in Table 1 (Gray, Gray, Hessman, &amp; Preite Martinez, 2008 ).

One of the motivations for using vocabularies was to allow astronomers to discover resources. These may have been tagged with concepts from vocabularies with which the astronomer is not familiar. To discover these resources using con-cepts familiar to the astronomer requires concepts in different vocabularies to be related.
 mapping concepts between vocabularies, which are similar to the corresponding intra-vocabulary relations. These are exact match (equivalent concepts), close match (similar but not equivalent concepts), broad match (a more general concept), narrow match (a more specific concept), and related match (an associated concept). These mappings allow for the exploration of con-cepts across vocabulary boundaries. It should be noted that there is a substantial cost in identifying and maintaining map-pings between vocabularies. As such, mappings are not required for each pair of vocabularies. Rather, if vocabulary A is mapped to vocabulary B and vocabulary B is mapped to vocabulary C , then vocabulary exploration techniques can be applied of mappings (which are not transitive in general) could result in bizarre or indeed incorrect associations between concepts. 3. Vocabulary search service resources and data, there needs to be a reliable mechanism for a user to search for appropriate vocabulary concepts. As a prototype of such a service we developed the Vocabulary Explorer (Gray, 2009 ), which also allows users to become familiar with the vocabularies. Screenshots from version 2 of the Vocabulary Explorer are shown in Fig. 2 . The Vocabulary Explorer provides an AJAX frontend to allow a user to search (left) and browse (right) ployed with the astronomical vocabularies 4 (Gray et al., 2008 ), which are summarised in Table 1. The Web frontend allows a user to enter a query to discover matching concepts. The Web service backend is in its third version, where each version has improved the search performance and are detailed below.
 3.1. Searching vocabularies len, 2002 ) for storing and searching vocabulary concepts. The vant concepts were converted into SeRQL queries. The generated query performed string matching on the lexical properties ferred label, regardless of which property of the SKOS concept had matched. While this provided a functional prototype it proved to be undesirable for several reasons. The first is that string matching in queries does not make use of stemming equally good for a search term, i.e. a concept matching a word in the definition is not as good as a concept matching the preferred label. Finally, the time taken to perform the search was unacceptably slow taking several seconds to return the result set.

The second version of the Vocabulary Explorer used the Terrier Information Retrieval Platform ( Ounis et al., 2007 ) with the Porter Stemmer to index and search the vocabulary concepts. This eliminated the problems of plurality and case. Each concept was indexed as a document without regard for the structure of the information in a concept. The results of a search were ranked using the PL2 weighting model. The time taken to return results was cut to a matter of milliseconds, however the UCD contain a concept for a star but when searching for  X  X  X tar X  the first of these was ranked 42: concepts such as Magnetic
Star and S Star were returned as the top ranked concepts, as shown in the top left screenshot of Fig. 2 . This prompted an investigation into the various weighting models and query modification techniques with a newly created test collection version of the prototype was widely used by the Virtual Observatory community and was well received. The third, and current, version of the Vocabulary Explorer continues to use Terrier to index and search the vocabularies.
However, the semantic information encoded in the SKOS vocabularies is now considered when indexing the vocabularies and exploited when ranking concepts by applying term weighting to the various ferred label has its matching score boosted, based on the results of the experiments presented in Section 4.2. The query re-sults returned by this service more closely match users X  expectations. For example, the search for  X  X  X tar X  now returns the star concept at rank 1, the IAUT STAR concept at rank 2, and the journal keywords Stars concept at rank 3, shown in Fig. 3 . However, the weighting model does not provide a perfect ranking: the the preferred label consisting of the string  X  X 3. Star X  which affects its ranking. 3.2. Exploring vocabularies
The Vocabulary Explorer Web application also allows a user to explore the results returned to their search. This makes use of the semantic relationships between SKOS concepts in a vocabulary and the ability to match concepts across vocabularies using mappings. For the astronomy vocabularies, there currently exists one mapping file. This mapping file relates the con-the concept 3. Star from the AVM vocabulary. This link is provided by the mapping where aaKeys: # Stars identifies the concept Stars in the journal keywords,
AVM vocabulary, and skos: # exactMatch states that there is an exact match between these concepts. Similarly, under the heading  X  X  X arrower Terms X  in the screenshot there are links to the vocabulary concepts in the journal keywords vocabulary that have a narrower term relationship with the Stars concept. This would also contain links to concepts with a narrow match mapping. There are also similar headings for broader terms and related terms.

The mapping files are currently only exploited in the exploration stage of the user interaction. The mappings provide a mechanism to jump from a concept within one vocabulary to a concept in another vocabulary. Note that both concepts may appear in the original set of search results. Indeed, in the example provided in Fig. 3 both star concepts appear in the result set. 4. Investigating concept retrieval
Our motivation for developing a system for concept retrieval is twofold. First, we would like to support the development and understanding of vocabularies in particular in the astronomy community, this led to the development of the Vocabulary
Explorer. Second, we would like to provide a service to enable semi-automatic tagging of resources with vocabulary con-cepts. Both of these services require a reliable method for converting a query into a vocabulary concept. However, as dem-we conducted experiments to investigate the performance of various existing weighting models and the effects of query of the experiments are presented below. 4.1. Test collection
The International Astronomical Union Thesaurus ( IAUT ) was used to create the test collection. This was due to the size of of the most complex with regard to the inclusion of semantic relationships and and related relationships as well as the use of SKOS scope notes. Note that none of the astronomical vocabularies in (Gray to the search engine for matching are the preferred and alternate labels, and the scope notes where they exist since the semantic relationships consist of URI pointers to other concepts.

The test collection contained 59 queries, each of which consisted of 1, 2, 3, or 4 search words, and the expected answers to the queries. Table 2 gives the number of each type of query together with the average number of relevant answers for the queries. The queries were drawn from the query log files for the Vocabulary Explorer. This ensured that the test queries are representative of the searches conducted by astronomers in the actual application.

The motivation for generating the test collection and investigating the search results was the poor ranking of the  X  X  X tar X  sure, the expected answers were marked as either highly relevant (2), relevant (1), or not relevant (0). Those concepts not explicitly given as expected answers to a query were assumed to be not relevant . An astronomer was consulted to ensure that the mark-up of the test collection was correct. 4.2. Experimental results
The investigation into the effectiveness of concept retrieval were conducted using the Terrier Information Retrieval Plat-form ( Ounis et al., 2007 ), extended so that it could index with the Porter Stemmer were used during indexing and querying, and each vocabulary concept was treated as a separate nDCG over MAP since it provides stronger discrimination between highly and marginally relevant documents. 4.2.1. Initial results
The initial run of the experiments aimed to investigate whether there was a difference between the various existing doc-ument weighting models. Each of the standard weighting models that come with Terrier were tested: BB2, BM25, DFR-BM25,
IFB2, In-expB2, In-expC2, InL2, PL2, and TF X  X DF. The standard parameters set by Terrier were used, i.e. where appropriate parameters b and c were set to 1 as suggested by Amati (2003) except for BM25 and TF X  X DF where b was set to 0.75 following
The results show extremely good search performance across all of the document weighting models with all values being in by the fact that BB2 did not return any documents for some queries.
 The extremely good performance across all of the document weighting models is at odds with the experience of the
Vocabulary Explorer version 2. This is unexpected since the queries for the test collection were drawn from the log files for the application, and the International Astronomy Union Thesaurus ( tion X  X  corpus. There are two factors that contribute to this. First is the new implementation of parsing indexing. This breaks the document into its constituent parts and ignores plorer considers all of the astronomical vocabularies presented in Table 1 within which there is a lot of crossover in their coverage, e.g. each has a Star concept. In particular, the presence of both the of the IAUT and thus contains almost the same concepts, means that there are multiple copies of concepts with the same
Document Frequency (IDF) components of the document weighting models used. 4.2.2. Query expansion
One of the aims of the vocabulary Web service is to return a single concept for a given search string so that a resource can be tagged either automatically or semi-automatically. This is a high precision search task. Usually query expansion (aka pseudo-relevance feedback) has been shown not to bring much benefit for high precision search tasks such as Web topic distillation and home page finding tasks (Hawking, 2000 ). However, given the nearly perfect performance of the first-pass retrieval on all queries (i.e. the initial ranking of documents), we hypothesise that additional high quality terms could be derived from the pseudo-relevant set and added to the initial query to enhance further the results.
We apply query expansion by adding 15 terms from the top 3 initially ranked documents (i.e. concepts) and adding these to the query. 6 The results of the application of query expansion are presented in row 2 of Table 3 . We note that the nDCG score for each of the document weighting models decreases when query expansion is used, although only very slightly. De-spite the good performance of the first-pass retrieval, the query expansion process did not bring enough additional evidence to improve the initial document ranking. This is in line with the high precision Web search tasks. 4.2.3. Term weighting
The SKOS preferred labels are unique within a vocabulary. We wanted to test the hypothesis that a search term that matches text in the SKOS preferred label is a  X  X  X etter X  result than one that matches text in another field, e.g. the search text matched the terms in the SKOS preferred label. To achieve this, the fields in which the terms occur were noted during indexing.
 Two sets of parameters were tested. The first boosted the score of the the initial run. For most of the document weighting models, only boosting the preferred label gave the best results. 4.2.4. Combination
For completeness, we also tested the combination of term weighting and query expansion. The final row of Table 3 , gives the results for combining query expansion (using 3 documents and 15 terms) with term weighting (using preferred label 1.0, alternative label 0.1). The combined effect was worse than using query expansion on its own. 4.3. Discussion
All of the document weighting models return exceptionally high nDCG scores with little to choose between their perfor-mance. The search results for all of the document weighting models were reduced when query expansion was used, and im-proved when using term weighting. The highest result was achieved using TF X  X DF with term weighting boosting the preferred label by 100%.

The results over the test collection do not match the experience with the Vocabulary Explorer version 2 where the most desired concept could be ranked very low, particularly when there are a large number of relevant concepts. This variation is due to the improved parsing and indexing of SKOS documents as shown by the experience with version 3 of the Vocabulary Explorer. The ranking of results is still not perfect, e.g. the concept 3. Star from the  X  X  X tar X . However, searches now provide acceptable answers which can be used for most applications, but there is scope for further investigation. For example, one could investigate how the coverage of labels (i.e. whether the query matches or the preferred label and the definition), could be used to improve the ranking. 5. Related work
The idea of using controlled vocabularies in information retrieval is not a new one (Fidel, 1991; Svenonius, 1986; van Rijs-bergen, 1979), nor is the idea of indexing the concepts of a vocabulary (Foskett, 1997 ). However, the focus of our research differs from conceptual indexing, where a synonym list perhaps generated from WordNet ( WordNet, 2006 ) is used to expand ging or retrieval. 2008) provide a search mechanism for finding a concept in a rank results meaning that the result a user requires is often in the first few returned results.
 LexGrid is a system developed with similar aims to ours for the biomedical domain (Pathak, Solbrig, Buntrock, Johnson, &amp;
Chute, 2009 ). As with our approach, LexGrid uses an information retrieval engine (Lucene) to index concepts. However, they draw their concepts from rich ontologies, containing lengthy textual descriptions for each concept, and expressed in onto-logical languages including OWL, OBO, and UMLS-RRF. The vocabularies that are available in astronomy contain a very lim-ited amount of text and thus offer different retrieval challenges. 6. Conclusions
In this paper, we have addressed the problem of finding the most relevant vocabulary concept for a keyword search. This work was motivated by the current situation in the Virtual Observatory where resources are tagged with freely generated keywords which leads to users being unable to find the resources relevant for their research. By using controlled vocabular-ies for this task we eliminate the ambiguity problems highlighted. It is hoped that vocabulary enabled applications can ben-efit from enhanced functionality by exploiting the vocabularies.

As a first step to enabling the use of controlled vocabulary concepts for tagging resources, we have developed a Vocab-with them. To improve the results returned by the Vocabulary Explorer, we investigated the capabilities of various weighting models and the effects of query modification techniques. We found that TF X  X DF with term weighting boosting the preferred labels provided the best results, although there was little difference between the weighting models. While the Vocabulary
Explorer has been developed for the astronomical Virtual Observatory community, it is generic and could be used to search and browse any SKOS encoded vocabularies and the mappings that link these vocabularies.

Our next step is to extend the existing registry browser to make use of our vocabulary service to tag and search for re-sources. We then intend to conduct a user evaluation of the two services. We also intend to investigate further the improve-ments that can be offered to recall and/or precision on searches involving vocabulary concepts by exploiting the hierarchies and the mappings of the vocabularies.
