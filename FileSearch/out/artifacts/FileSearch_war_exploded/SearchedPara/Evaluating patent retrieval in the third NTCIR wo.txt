 1. Introduction models. A sample of existing test collections includes those produced in TREC 1 , CLEF 2 , and NTCIR 3 ,in which most of the target documents are newspaper articles and abstracts in technical publications. In the Third NTCIR Workshop (NTCIR-3), which was held over a period of one and a half years (from June 2001 to December 2002), the first serious effort was made to explore information retrieval, targeting patent documents. During the NTCIR-3 Workshop, the authors of this paper organized the Patent Retrie-val Task ( Iwayama, Fujii, Kando, &amp; Takano, 2003 ) 4 , in which a test collection of patent documents was produced and used to evaluate a number of participating IR systems.

While a number of commercial patent retrieval systems and services have operated for a long time, pat-ent retrieval has not received much attention in the IR community. A major reason is the lack of test col-lections targeting patent information. Although a TREC test collection includes patent documents, the proportion of those documents is quite small. Consequently, most systems do not seriously use techniques focusing on patent documents, because the effect may be overshadowed by a larger number of other genres of documents, such as newspaper articles. However, patent documents (applications) are associated with a number of interesting characteristics, such as document length and document structures, for information retrieval, even from a scientific point of view. This background motivated us to promote research and devel-opment on patent information retrieval, by providing a test collection consisting of patent documents.
The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we describe the process of producing the above collection, namely the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Collection (Section 2). Second, we report experimental results retrieval models in the context of patent information retrieval, which has not been explored much in past IR literature. 2. NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Task 2.1. Task Description
The process of patent retrieval differs significantly depending on the type (purpose) of retrieval, such as technology survey or invalidity search. Each retrieval type was fundamentally worth exploring in the NTCIR-3 Workshop. However, certain retrieval types require a sufficient number of patent documents. For example, in invalidity search, professional users usually search at least five years worth of patents for applications conflicting with the patent in question. At the same time, for many (potential) participant groups, processing an enormous volume of patent information seemed prohibitive. In view of this problem, we focused on a specific type of  X  X  X echnology survey X  X  in which two years of patents were used as target documents.

In our technology survey task, we focused on novice users, such as business managers, who usually do not use retrieval systems by themselves, but command professional searchers to obtain patent documents relevant to their information needs. We assumed a scenario in which a business manager reading a news-paper clips out an article associated with an interesting technology. The manager asks a professional searcher (an expert) to find patent documents related to the clipping. The manager may also hands an addi-tional memorandum to the searcher to clarify the information required if the clippings are not informative and include irrelevant sentences ( Fig. 1 ).

From a different perspective, the above scenario can be seen as a cross-genre (or cross-database) retrie-val, in which a newspaper article and supplementary description are used as a query to search a patent col-lection for documents relevant to the query. As a result, a new retrieval model using different term frequencies depending on the genre ( Itoh, Mano, &amp; Ogawa, 2003 ) was proposed in the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Task.

It should be noted that although claims are more informative and important than other fields (e.g., example fields) in many retrieval scenarios, methods relying mainly on claims are not necessarily appropri-ate for the purpose of technology surveys. It should also be noted that while precision is generally more important than recall for invalidity searches, both precision and recall are important for technology sur-veys. Thus, we used standard precision/recall-based measures to evaluate participating systems.
In summary, in the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Task, participant groups were required to submit a list of relevant patent documents in response to a search topic consisting of a newspaper article and a supplemen-tary description. Search topics were in four languages. In other words, the same contents in Japanese, Eng-lish, Korean, traditional/simplified Chinese were used to perform cross-language retrieval 5 . 2.2. Document Collections
In the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Collection, target documents are two years worth of unexamined Jap-anese patent applications published in 1998 and 1999. Fundamentally, those applications are used as a col-lection from which relevant documents are retrieved in response to search topics. The NTCIR-3 Patent
Retrieval Collection also contains edited Japanese/English abstracts for Japanese applications published in 1995 X 1999.

Japanese abstracts, the JAPIO Patent Abstracts, are edited on the basis of summaries in source applica-tions. If a summary written by an applicant is not understandable or does not describe the invention in question precisely, a professional editor produces a new abstract by modifying the summary. Otherwise, the summary is used as an abstract with minor revision. In either case, the length of the JAPIO Patent
Abstracts is standardized. The average number of characters in the abstracts is approximately 400. In addition, keywords not included in an abstract are added by an editor mainly for retrieval purposes. English abstracts, the Patent Abstracts of Japan (PAJ), are human translations of the JAPIO Patent Abstracts. Those additional documents were primarily intended for training cross-language IR systems.
However, those abstracts can also be used as target documents, because relevant abstracts can be identified from relevance assessments performed for applications. Table 1 shows the overview of patent documents in the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Collection.
 2.3. Search Topics
As described in Section 2.1, search topics consist of newspaper articles (clippings) and supplementary memorandums describing user information needs. To produce realistic topics, we asked 12 members of the Intellectual Property Information Search Committee in the Japan Intellectual Property Association (JIPA) 6 to produce 31 topics on the basis of existing patents. Each JIPA member belongs to the intellectual property division in the company he or she works for, and they are all experts in patent searching.
Fig. 2 shows an example English search topic in SGML form. In this figure, the fields marked with  X  X &lt;ARTICLE&gt; X  X  and  X  X &lt;SUPPLEMENT&gt; X  X  correspond to a newspaper clipping and supplementary mem-orandum, respectively. As with other existing test collections, search topics also contain fields for titles article and supplement fields is as informative as the description field. However, newspaper articles often contain sentences irrelevant to search topics. Example terms associated with a topic are marked with  X  X &lt;CONCEPT&gt; X  X . One or more IDs of the patents used to produce the topic and IDs of applications rel-ually translated into English, Korean and, traditional or simplified Chinese.

In the Patent Retrieval Task, for the purpose of cross-system evaluation in a standard framework, each participant group was obliged to submit at least one retrieval result obtained with a combination of the article and supplement fields. However, in principle, any fields can be used to formulate queries depending on the purpose of evaluation. 2.4. Relevance Assessment
Relevance assessment was performed as follows: 1. After/while producing topics, the JIPA members performed manual searches to collect as many relevant 2. Participant groups submitted retrieval results, from each of which we extracted the top 30 patent doc-uments, and produced a pool of patent documents for each of the 31 topics. We shall call this pool  X  X  X S X  X . 3. The JIPA members assessed the relevance for patent documents in  X  X  X S-PJ X  X , which were the patents they had not seen in their preliminary search.

It should be noted that by combining PJ and PS, we can find relevant documents more exhaustively than in TREC.

Grades of relevance were  X  X  X  (relevant) X  X ,  X  X  X  (partially relevant) X  X ,  X  X  X  (irrelevant, judged by reading the content of a document) X  X , and  X  X  X  (irrelevant, judged by looking at only the title of a document) X  X . When judging A, B, and C, claims and other fields were considered equally important. The average numbers of A, B, C, and D documents were 45.2, 29.3, 141.4, and 411.4, respectively.

To produce the first six topics, the 12 members were divided into six groups consisting of two members, and each group produced one topic and performed relevance assessment. If there was disagreement between two members in the same group, they negotiated with each other to complete the six topics. However, for the remaining 25 topics, each of the 12 members independently produced one or more topics and performed relevance assessment, because negotiation (cross-check) was time-consuming. In all cases, members created queries in the domain of their professional work.

Unlike existing methods for relevance assessment used in previous NTCIR workshops, in which manual searches were performed after pooling to increase the exhaustiveness of the relevant documents, we per-formed manual searches before pooling to enable the comparison of the search abilities of human experts and participant systems. The average numbers of  X  X  X  X  X  documents in  X  X  X J-PS X  X ,  X  X  X S-PJ X  X , and  X  X  X J \ PS X  X  were 14.2, 11.0, and 20.0, respectively. In other words, the numbers of relevant documents obtained by par-ticipating systems were fairly comparable with those obtained by the JIPA members. Table 2 shows the numbers of  X  X  X  X  X  documents in  X  X  X J-PS X  X ,  X  X  X S-PJ X  X , and  X  X  X J \ PS X  X , respectively, on a topic-by-topic basis. a general tendency. 3. Experimentation 3.1. Overview
The purpose of our experiments was to re-examine existing retrieval models from different perspectives, in the context of patent retrieval. For this purpose, we performed experiments on retrieving both patent documents and newspaper articles, and compared the results to find the scientific knowledge inherent in the patents (e.g., one related to term frequencies, inverse document frequencies, and document length). Thus, we used the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Collection described in Section 2 and the NTCIR-3 CLIR (cross-lingual information retrieval) test collection consisting of two years worth of Japanese  X  X  X ainichi X  X  newspaper articles, to perform comparative experiments.

It may be argued that we can obtain certain knowledge by analyzing official results obtained with par-ticipating systems in the NTCIR-3 Workshop. However, because fundamental modules, such as morpho-logical analyzers and term weighting methods, differed depending on the system, it is difficult to conduct a glass-box evaluation. In view of this problem, we implemented different retrieval models (systems) and per-formed comparative experiments independently of the NTCIR-3 Workshop.

We used the ChaSen morphological analyzer (version 2.2.9) combined with the IPA dictionary (version 2.4.4) 7 to extract nouns, verbs, adjectives, and out-of-dictionary words (i.e., words identified as  X  X  X n-known X  X  by ChaSen) as index terms from target documents, and performed word-based indexing. Out-of-dictionary words are often technical terms. We also used the same method to extract terms from search topics. We used GETA (Generic Engine for Transportable Association) 8 , which includes C/Perl libraries for typical retrieval modules, and implemented different retrieval models on a distributed environment con-sisting of two PCs (CPU: dual Xeon 1.7GHz, RAM: 2GB). Because all the software toolkits and test col-lections used are available to the public, our experiments can easily be reproduced.

We used the following contents as target documents independently:  X  entire contents (full texts) of unexamined patent applications (Full),  X  author abstracts in unexamined patent applications (Abs),  X  claims in unexamined patent applications (Claim),  X  a combination of Abs and Claim (Abs+Claim),  X  the JAPIO Patent Abstracts in 1998 and 1999 (Jsh),  X  two years of Mainichi newspaper articles in 1998 and 1999 (Newspaper).

Here, unexamined patent applications are target documents in the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Collection (i.e., two years of Japanese patent applications published in 1998 and 1999).

Table 3 shows statistics associated with the document length in words for different target document types. By looking at this table, one can see that the average length of Full is approximately 24 times that of Newspaper. The standard variance of Full is approximately 20 times that of Newspaper. In other words, the length of patent applications in words significantly differs depending on the document. Additionally, the maximum number of unique words (word types) contained in a single application is approximately 30,000, which is 20 times as large as that of newspaper articles.

Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the document length in words for different target document types. In this figure, the distribution of the document length for Abs and Jsh is roughly a normal distribution.
Fig. 4 shows the retrieval models compared in our experiments; they form a sample of typical models ( Salton, 1971 ). Unlike the other seven models, SMART and BM25 ( Robertson &amp; Walker, 1994 ) 9 use the document length factor, which has been proved effective in the IR literature ( Singhal, Buckley, &amp; Mitra, 1998 ). It should be noted that because the nine retrieval models were implemented based on common soft-ware modules, differences among retrieval models in retrieval accuracy are because of the effectiveness of the models themselves.

For the purpose of formulating queries in patent retrieval, we used the following (combinations of) topic fields independently:  X  X &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt; X  X ,  X  X &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt; + &lt;NARRATIVE&gt; X  X , and  X  X &lt;ARTICLE&gt; + &lt;SUPPLEMENT&gt; X  X .
 For retrieving newspaper articles, we used  X  X &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt; X  X  and a combination of  X  X &lt;DESCRIP-TION&gt; X  X  and  X  X &lt;NARRATIVE&gt; X  X , extracted from all 42 topics in the NTCIR-3 CLIR collection. In all cases, we used only Japanese topics. 3.2. Results
Tables 4 and 5 show the mean average precision (MAP) values targeting patent documents and newspa-per articles, respectively. In both tables, only  X  X  X  X  X  documents were regarded as relevant ones (i.e., rigid to retrieval models and average precision values, respectively. Table 6 shows the MAP values of SMART and BM25 combined with different indexing methods, i.e., words, character bi-grams, and a combination of words and bi-grams. 3.3. Discussion
We discuss suggestions derived from Tables 4 X 6 and Fig. 5 , from different perspectives. 3.3.1. Term Frequencies
In almost all cases (runs), the MAP value of the model relying solely on term frequencies (i.e., the tf model) was smallest in all the models compared. The tf model was even worse than the hits and baseline models. Additionally, the MAP value of the idf model was often decreased when combined with the tf model (i.e., the tf.idf model) 10 .

We used the paired t -test for statistical testing, which investigates whether the difference in performance 12 cases at the 1% level, respectively. Besides this, when retrieving newspaper articles, the MAP values of simple (naive) use of term frequencies was not effective and even decreased the MAP value.
However, the logarithmic formulation of term frequencies (i.e., the log(tf ) models) was effective when combined with the idf model. That is, the MAP value of the log(tf).idf model was greater than that of the idf model, specifically in cases where target documents are full texts. In Table 7 , the MAP values of the log(tf ).idf and idf models were significantly different in the three patent runs and the two newspaper runs (at the 1% level), respectively. At the same time, when retrieving abstracts, we could not find any sig-nificant differences between the log(tf).idf and idf models in the MAP value. In other words, the log(tf) model was effective in retrieving longer documents. 3.3.2. Inverse Document Frequencies
Inverse document frequencies were generally effective. For Jsh and Abs, the MAP value of the idf model was greater than those of the SMART and BM25 models.

For Jsh, the MAP value of the idf model was greater than those of the other models, irrespective of the topic field used. The MAP values of the idf model and the second highest model were significantly different at the 1% level (which is not shown in the tables). Additionally, for Abs, the MAP value of the idf model was greater than those of the other models except  X  X  X S X  X . The MAP values of the idf model and the second highest model were significantly different at the 5% level (which is not shown in the tables).
One possible rationale is that because abstracts (Jsh and Abs) are standardized (normalized) in terms of document length, the effect of the document length model in SMART and BM25 was decreased. 3.3.3. Comparison Between SMART and BM25
The MAP values of SMART and BM25 were generally greater than those of the other models. The dif-ference between SMART and BM25 in the MAP value was marginal. In fact, in Table 7 the MAP values of SMART and BM25 were significantly different at the 5% level, for only five cases.

However, for cross-genre retrieval (i.e., scenarios in which queries were formulated from combinations of  X  X &lt;ARTICLE&gt; X  X  and  X  X &lt;SUPPLEMENT&gt; X  X , the MAP value of SMART was usually greater than that of
BM25. A possible reason is attributed to the log  X  N n t  X  0 : 5 newspaper article.

However, a patent including those important terms more likely takes a negative value of log  X  N n t  X  0 : 5 fluctuation of the value, for a negative value of x , a marginal change of n t leads to a great change of the score.

To investigate the above-mentioned analysis quantitatively, we replaced the logarithm factor in BM25 with the IDF factor used in SMART, and re-examined the performance of BM25. As a result, the MAP value of the modified BM25 was almost equivalent to that of SMART in the cross-genre retrieval. 3.3.4. Cross-genre Retrieval
By comparing the MAP values obtained with  X  X &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt; X  X  and  X  X &lt;NARRATIVE&gt; X  X  and those obtained with combinations of  X  X &lt;ARTICLE&gt; X  X  and  X  X &lt;SUPPLEMENT&gt; X  X , one can see that the MAP value of cross-genre retrieval was generally smaller than that of conventional retrieval.
 A possible rationale is that the distribution of term frequencies differs depending on the document genre.
In fact, in the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Task, a retrieval model using different term frequencies depending on the genre ( Itoh et al., 2003 ) improved the MAP value of a standard model. At the same time, we do not pretend to draw any premature conclusions regarding the relative merits of different models in cross-genre retrieval. This issue remains an open question and should be further explored. 3.3.5. Comparison Between Full Texts and Abstracts
The MAP values targeting full patent texts were generally greater than those for abstracts. Specifically, for SMART and BM25, the MAP values of full texts and abstracts were significantly different at the 1% level (which is not shown in the tables).

By comparing Jsh and Abs in Table 4 , the MAP value of Jsh was greater than that of Abs, except for the gests that professional abstracts generally maintain higher quality than author abstracts for retrieval purposes. 3.3.6. Comparison Between Patents and Newspapers
By looking at Fig. 5 , the relative superiority among different retrieval models did not significantly differ depending on the document genre (i.e., patents and newspaper articles). This may be counter-intuitive, because patent documents are significantly different from newspaper articles from a number of perspectives, such as document length and terminology. However, those perspectives did not affect the results of our experiments. In other words, existing standard models were relatively effective even for patent retrieval.
One possible rationale is that our experiments simulated technology survey, which was relatively similar NTCIR-4 Patent Retrieval Task, we plan to perform an invalidity search task in which each participant group searches five years worth of patent applications for those that could invalidate the demand in an existing claim. 3.3.7. Comparison Among Indexing Methods
In Table 6 , the MAP values of the word and character bi-gram indexing methods are almost equivalent, irrespective of the retrieval model (i.e., SMART and BM25) and topic fields used (i.e., D and DN). How-ever, when word and bi-gram indexes were used together, the MAP values were improved. In this table, the last line shows the optimal ratio of word and bi-gram weights in the combination method, determined through experiments for each case. The optimal MAP values were usually obtained when the weight of word indexes were greater than that of bi-gram indexes excepting BM25 + DN. The effectiveness of com-bining the word and bi-gram indexing methods was also observable in past experiments for Japanese IR ( Jones, Sakai, Kajiura, &amp; Sumita, 1998 ).

Because the accuracy of word segmentation for Japanese texts is not 100%, the bi-gram indexing method often successfully retrieves the relevant documents that the word-based indexing method fails to retrieve. In addition, the accuracy of word segmentation highly depends on the word dictionary used. Thus, the com-bination indexing method is effective specifically in retrieving patents, in which the number of out-of-dic-tionary words is greater than those in other document genres. 4. Conclusion
Given the growing number of large test collections for information retrieval (IR) since the 1990s, exten-sive comparative experiments have been performed to explore the effectiveness of various retrieval models. Most collections consist of newspaper articles and abstracts in technical publications.

While a number of commercial patent retrieval systems and services have operated for a long time, pat-ent retrieval has not received much attention in the IR community. One of the major reasons is the lack of test collections targeting patent information. This background motivated us to promote research and devel-opment on patent information retrieval, by providing a test collection consisting of patent documents.
In this paper, we described the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Collection and comparative experiments per-formed using this collection. First, we described the process of producing the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval of Japanese patent abstracts and their English translations. Since this collection was produced to evaluate IR systems for technology survey, search topics were produced on the basis of technical newspaper articles. Human experts in patent searching produced 31 topics and also performed relevance assessment.
Second, we reported experimental results obtained by using the above collection. For these experiments, we used open software toolkits to implemented nine existing retrieval models and re-examined the effective-ness of those models in the context of patent retrieval. To investigate the scientific knowledge inherent in patent retrieval, we also used the NTCIR-3 CLIR test collection consisting of two years of newspaper arti-cles, and compared the results obtained with different genres of documents.

Through our experiments, we re-validated past experimental results (e.g., discussions associated with the effectiveness of term frequencies, inverse document frequencies, and document length) in the context of pat-ent retrieval. We also found that existing state-of-the-art retrieval models (i.e., SMART and BM25) were effective in patent retrieval.

To further explore patent retrieval from a scientific point of view, in the NTCIR-4 Patent Retrieval Task, we are performing an invalidity search task in which users search five years worth of patent applications for those that can invalidate the demand in an existing claim.
