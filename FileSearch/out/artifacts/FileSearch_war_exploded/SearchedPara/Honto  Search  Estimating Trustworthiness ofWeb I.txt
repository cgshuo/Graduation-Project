 People often become unsure about a statement they encounter on the Web, for example a statement such as gthe Japanes e Prime Minister is Junichiro Koizumih or gdinosaurs became extinct 65 million years agoh. In such a case, the user often types in the statement into a search en gine, and examines how common it is on the Web, or tries to check if there are any contradicting answers. This is, however, a time consuming task.

We therefore propose a system that hel ps the user in determining trustwor-thiness of a topic that he or she is unconfident about. We named our system gHonto? Searchh. gHonto?h means gIs it really?h in Japanese. We focus on as-sisting the user to make a judgment on trustworthiness, rather than making an absolute decision.

There are various criteria for information X  X  trustworthiness: the level of popu-larity, the author X  X  reliability, or consistency of the content itself. In our research, however, we use popularity as the criterion. In other words, our system provides the user with popularity estimation of a phrase and its alternative or counter ex-amples occurring on the Web. The system al so presents changes in the frequency of these phrases in time, in order to help the user to decide if the original phrase is up-to-date, or if it has been continuously stated for a long span of time, thus ensuring its reliability.

In order to provide such functionality, the system performs the following pro-cedure. First, it divides the phrase given by the user into parts, and constructs a query that would be sent to a web search engine. Secondly, it extracts alternative or counter examples to the original phrase out of the search results. Thirdly, the system sends the original phrase and the counter examples to the web search en-gine again, and obtains their present frequencies. Fourthly, it sends the phrases to a web archive and obtains the temporal change in their frequencies. The result is presented to the user as a list of phrases and a graph indicating the temporal change.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follo ws. Section 2 describes related work. Section 3 presents the method of extra cting counter examples from the Web. Section 4 presents the method of tempora l analysis using a web archive. Section 5 describes the result of the experiment m ade to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Lastly, Section 6 concludes the paper. 2.1 Web QA Web question answering (Web QA) systems are similar to our system in that they retrieve text segments from the Web to answer the user X  X  information requests. However, they are different from our system in terms of goals. Web QA systems use the Web to find an answer to a question posed by the user [1,11]. Most Web QA systems go no further than finding an answer to the query. For example, TRECfs question answering track provides a benchmark for evaluating efficiency in finding an answer to the user specified question 1 .Itisassumedthattheanswer is reliable and the user is satisfied once he or she gets it. In reality, however, this is not often the case with the Web since it contains a lot of unreliable and obsolete information. In our system, the user does not type in an interrogative sentence. Instead, the user types in a phrase whose trustworthiness he or she doubts. The goal is to extract additional information from the Web to help the user judge the trustworthiness of the proposition contained in the phrase.
There is a recent trend in Web QA systems to utilize redundancy of information found on the Web [4,5,10]. Systems that do this aggregate phrases and present the most frequent one as the answer. This was made possible by the tremendous size of the Web compared to the traditional QA source data (corpora). Although these systems are similar to ours in that they utilize redundancy of information on the Web, the aim and the approach is different from our system. 2.2 Term Dynamics Our system uses temporal changes in frequencies of phrases to filter out obsolete information. Kleinberg m ade a survey of recent approac hes for analyzing term dynamics in text streams [9]. Kleinberg X  X   X  X ord burst X  is a well-known method for examining changes in word frequencies over time [8]. It is a state-based ap-proach that measures term dynamics chara cterized by transitions between two states: low and high frequen cy one. Kleinberg X  X  work, however, was intended to model significant bursts of terms in text streams, whereas in our system we com-pare differences between the frequenci es of phrases and their duration in time. Kizasi 2 is an online system that extracts k eywords that have recently become increasingly popular recently. This syst em focuses only on keywords, in contrast to our method. 2.3 Web Archives We propose utilizing web archives in order to estimate the popularity of propo-sitions in time on the Web. Web archives preserve the history of the Web and indirectly reflect the past states and knowledge of the societies. Until now, how-ever, Web archiving community has mostl y concentrated on harvesting, storing and preserving Web pages as they pose numerous challenges. Relatively, little attention has been paid to utilizing Web archive data despite the fact that it offers a great potential for knowledge discovery purposes. Aschenbrenner and Rauber discussed possible benefits and approaches towards adopting traditional Web mining tasks in the context of Web archives [3]. Recently, Arms et al. have reported on ongoing work aiming to build a research platform for studying the evolution of the content and the structure of the Web [2]. We believe that suc-cessful completion of similar projects i n the future will enable more effective knowledge discovery from the history of the Web. 2.4 What Honto? Search is Not The following list indicates some of the functions that are not realized by Honto? Search.
 Keyword search: In Honto? Search, the user query is a phrase. It is different from conventional web search engines where the user inputs keywords. Page search: The search results of Honto? Sear ch are relative frequencies of the query phrase in comparison to alternative phrases. The system presents aggregated knowledge instead of the lists of web pages as in the case of conven-tional search engines.
 Opinion miner: The main target of Honto? Search is factual information. It is not intended to collect people X  X  opinions on certain topics where no definite answer exists. In this section we describe how to identify alternative propositions, or counter examples, for a phrase query given by the user. More generally, the system finds terms that fit into a specific part in the user X  X  query. For example, for a phrase  X  X inosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago X , the user may want to check if  X 65 million X  is actually true. In this case, the system searches the Web to find other terms that constitute the expression, such as  X 60 million X ,  X 70 million X , or even  X 10 thousand X  (which is wrong). We call such terms alternative terms , and a phrase containing it will be called an alternative proposition .
In Honto? Search, the user selects a part from a phrase that he or she is unsure about. The part will be called verification target in this paper. Terms that would replace the verification target in the phrase are alternative terms. If the user does not specify a verification target, then the system performs the procedure to each word in the phrase.

The system performs the following procedure to identify alternative proposi-tions. Fig. 2 explains this procedure. 1. The query is constructed by splitting the phrase into two parts by verification 2. The system sends a query  X  P 1 &amp; P 2  X  to a web search API. Alternative 3. Alternative terms are sorted according to their frequencies. The more they
An alternative proposition is constructed by inserting an alternative term between two separated parts of the original phrase, P 1 and P 2 .Eachalternative proposition is again sent to the search engine, to obtain its frequency.
One of the problems with Honto? Search now is that it is still incapable to handle statements with negations. Fort unately, frequencies of such statements are relatively low compared to the positive ones, so the aggregated answers usually show good results.

In case the web search API returned too few results, searching is performed again by relaxing the query. The system extracts nouns, verbs, or adjectives from each alternative proposition and performs multiple keyword search. It constructs the query by connecting keywords with  X  &amp; X . In the example, the query will be  X  X inosaurs &amp; became &amp; extinct &amp; 65 &amp; million &amp; years X . The system then searches within the retrieved web pages to find a sentence that contains all the keyword.

This step allows the system to retri eve phrases with the same meaning but expressed in different forms. Although the method is vulnerable if many sen-tences contain negations, expectations, or interrogatives, we assumed that once the result is presented as a list, the user can check it by accessing the snippets which are linked from the alternative phrases.

The frequencies are then presented to the user. By comparing the frequency of the original phrase with the frequencies of alternative propositions, the user can get an idea of how much the phrase is supported on the Web. Because the sentences collected by the a pproach proposed in Section 3 are gener-ated at different times, it is not appropriate to use them for a majority decision without careful consideration. For example, consider the proposition,  X  X he host city of the next Summer Olympic Games is Beijing X . This proposition is correct only until the event is held in 2008. This example shows that trustworthiness of the proposition is strongly dependent on time.

In addition, if the system considers t emporal information, it can estimate trustworthiness of the proposition from d ifferent aspect also. That is, the system can evaluate how continuously the pro position has been accepted over time.
We define two criteria for determination of trustworthiness. Fig. 3 explains this procedure. 4.1 Analysis of Creation Time of Web Pages To analyze the temporal distribution of web pages relevant to a proposition, we need to determine when each page wa s created. The system uses Internet Archive 3 . Internet Archive is the well-known public web archive offering about 2 petabytes of data. The access to Inter net Archive is provided by Wayback Machine that allows viewing snapshots of pages from the past. Using Wayback Machine it is possible to reconstruct the histories of web pages. After issuing URL address of a given page Wayback Machine returns the list of available page snapshots together with their timestamps. We can estimate the creation time of pages by considering the oldest timestamp s that appear in the list. Consequently, it is possible to analyze the temporal distribution of creation time of pages that refer to a given proposition.
Utilizing Internet Archive for temporal analysis has, however, several limita-tions. First, the temporal scope of page snapshots is constrained. Crawling of Web pages has started since 1996. There is also no data provided that is younger than 6 months due to the policy of Internet Archive. Second, after a closer inspec-tion we discovered that there are some gaps in the data due to uneven crawling pattern in the past. Third, page creation dates estimated by our method are only approximations of the actual origin dates of pages. There is always some delay between the creation of a page and i ts detection by Web crawlers. Lastly, it is also unsure whether propositions occurring on pages have actually appeared at the time of page creation and not later due to subsequent updates made to page content. Nevertheless, since our approach analyzes relatively large number of pages and utilizes relative frequencies of phrases, satisfactory results can still be obtained despite the above limitations. 4.2 Trustworthiness of the Proposition in a Certain Period In this section, we propose a way of estimating trustworthiness of a proposition in a specific period by comparing the temporal distribution of a proposition with that of alternative propositions.
 In the first step, we define PF A of proposition A at time period t ( PF is Proposition Frequency) .
 Proposition Frequency of proposition A at time period t Using PF , we can estimate which proposition is the most reliable in a certain period of alternative propositions. That is, if we want to estimate which propo-sition is more reliable, proposition A or proposition B in time period t ,weonly have to compare PF A ( t )with PF B ( t ). If PF A ( t ) is greater than PF B ( t ), we can estimate that proposition A is truer in period t than proposition B. We calcu-late PF ( t ) of the proposition, which is the proposition the user inputs into our system and PF ( t ) of alternative propositions which our system made from the original proposition, and we identify the proposition for which PF ( t )hasthe greatest score as the most reliable proposition in period t.

Usually, the number of newly generated web pages has many up-downs in a short span, forming a zigzag line over time. Considering this phenomenon, we modify PF by using the information over a certain period. We adopted the moving average in order to solve this problem [7] .
 Modification to PF A ( t ) with Moving Average We mo dify PF A ( t ) (the original value of a proposition frequency) around time period t by a window size 2 n + 1. By comparing each PF modified by moving average, the system finally estimates trustworthiness of a proposition in a certain period. 4.3 Proposition Continuity Honto? Search employs temporal analysis not only in order to select the most recently popular proposition (as described in Subsection 4.2), but also to inform the user whether the proposition has appeared on the Web for a long enough period of time. The underlining assumption is that such information is helpful in determining trustworthiness of the proposition. For example, a proposition  X  X luminum is the cause of Alzheimer X  X  disease X  was once a popular theory and has been widely discussed on theWeb, yet not as much now. On the other hand, a proposition  X  X lzheimer X  X  d isease causes dementia X  st ill commonly appears on the Web. Presenting the temporal change in the frequencies of the two propositions would help the user to make judgment on reliability of the two.

The difference between the two is formalized as follows: in the case of a propo-sition that sustains to be reliable over time, web pages referring to the proposi-tion are constantly generated. On the other hand, in the case of a proposition which was reliable only during a certain limited period of time, the amount of new web pages containing the proposition decreases once the proposition ceases to be reliable. In order to draw a line between the two, we look to a theory in psychology.

According to Hermann Ebbinghaus, a person X  X  memory decreases exponen-tially [6]. The amount of remaining memory R at time t is defined as follows, using a coefficient  X  :
Based on this theory, we built the following model. When the amount of web pages containing the proposition is over  X  of the amount on the prior month, we judge that the proposition is still attracting people X  X  attention. On the other hand, if the amount is less than  X  of the prior month, we judge that the propo-sition has entered the receding phase; i t is losing people X  X  attention and will eventually be forgotten by the public.  X  is a threshold value and may be ad-justed experimentally.

We define proposition continuity as a measurement indicating how long a proposition has been attracting peoplefs attention. We assume that the number of new web pages containing the proposition reflects peoplefs attention to it.
PC A ( t )is proposition continuity of a proposition A at time t . It is defined as follows: Proposition continuity of a proposition A at time t  X  is a threshold value for det ecting the receding phase.  X  is a coefficient that would decrease PC exponentially when PF is dramatically decreasing. If the amount of new web pages containing the proposition A is more than  X  of the prior month, PC A ( t ) increases by PF A ( t ) .Iftheratioisbelow  X  , PC A ( t ) drops rapidly, since we assume that the propo sition has entered the receding phase.
Honto? Search presents PC to the user as the indicator of how consistently the proposition was supported by the public. In this section, we describe the result of e xperiments that tested the effectiveness of our approach on estimating trustworthiness of propositions. 5.1 Discovery of Alternative Propositions and Aggregating To get alternative propositions, we used Yahoo! Web Search APIs 4 ,awebser-vice for searching Yahoo! X  X  index and got 1,000 results for each proposition. We collected only web pages in Japanese. Fr om snippets of the search results, we extracted alternative terms using the m ethod described in Section 3. Then we counted the frequency of each alternative term and eliminated the ones which had a frequency lower than 15 % of the most frequent one. This is because we assumed that terms whose frequencies are currently low are not appropriate as alternative terms.
 After creating alternative propositions containing alternative terms, we used a Japanese morphological analyzer, Mecab 5 , to extract nouns, verbs and adjectives from the snippets (brief summaries of search results). Finally we collected 1,000 web pages for each alternative query and aggregated them using the procedure described in Section 3.

We performed experiments on two propositions,  X  X here are 15 countries in the European Union X  (Example 1) and  X  X he President of China is Hu Jintao X  (Example 2). Verification targets were  X 15 X  and  X  X u Jintao X , respectively.
Table 1 lists the frequencies of the original and alternative propositions in the web search results. For example, for the proposition gthere are 15 countries in the European Unionh, we got two alternative terms, X 25 X  and  X 10 X . The most frequent one was  X 25 X , which is the correct answer. The alternative  X 15 X  also produced many results, since it was true until 2004. Additionally, the alternative term  X 10 X , was also frequently reported on the Web, which must have come from expressions such as  X 10 new countries in the European Union X . The user can judge that the original proposition may not be trustworthy, since it is not the most frequent one.

For the proposition,  X  X he President of China is Hu Jintao X , we got an alter-natives proposition  X  X he President of China is Jiang Zemin X , which was actually true until 2003. From the table, the user can judge that  X  X he President of China is Hu Jintao X  is reliable, since it is the most frequent one. These are simple estimations which do not consider the temporal aspect.

Furthermore, we performed a thorough experiment using a list of historical events (historical time table) 6 as a test set, to see whet her the system justifies these events as  X  X rue X , when compared with other mistaken information on the Web. In the time table, there were 360 major historical events dating from 3000 B.C. to 2003. We constructed verification targets by connecting the event name and the year when it occured, i.e.  X  X he moon landing by Apollo 11 on 1969 X . A search query is constructed by replacing the year with a wild-card, i.e.  X  X he moon landing by Apollo 11 on *  X . Out of 360 queries, 116 has returned search results. The system then collected other candidate s specifying different years (i.e.  X  X he moon landing by Apollo 11 on 1970 X ) and ranked them by their frequencies on the Web. We checked if the correct answ ers were ranked high when compared with other candidate phrases.

Fig. 4 illustrates the result of the experiment. 62% of the correct phrases were top ranked by the system, 9 % were ranked 2nd, and 3 % were ranked 3rd, while the rest was ranked 4th or below. 5.2 Analysis of Page Creation Times Based on the method discussed in Section 3, we calculated PF and PC for the original and alternative propositions, in order to see the trustworthiness from the temporal point of view. We used the Internet Archive to estimate when each web page was created. We considered pages that were created between 1998 and now. In the Internet Archive, the user can not see web pages that are collected more recently than 6 months. Therefore, we could only use data until July 2006 and on. For calculating moving average, we used n = 6. For calculating PC ,we used 0.8 for  X  and 0.5 for  X  .

Fig. 5 shows that PF of  X  X here are 25 countries in the European Union X  overwhelms the other two propositions around 2004. The user can guess that there was possibly a change in the number of the countries in the European Union.
 Fig. 6 shows that although PF of the proposition  X  X he President of China is Jiang Zemin X  is higher than that of  X  X he President of China is Hu Jintao X  at the beginning, they reversed around 2003. In fact, Jiang Zemin was the President of China until March 2003 and Hu Jintao has been the president ever since. Fig. 7 shows that for the proposition  X  X here are 15 countries in the European Union X , PC decreases at the end, indicating that it is no longer true.
Fig. 8 shows that PC for  X  X he President of China is Hu Jintao X  continues to increase, while PC for  X  X he President of China is Jiang Zemin X  decreases at one point, indicating the change in the presidency. In case the user wants to know whether a proposition is true or false, there are no systems available which estimate trustworthiness of this proposition. Therefore we have proposed a method that aggregates information on the Web and esti-mates trustworthiness of a proposition from the viewpoint of time by aggregating web search result and using a web archive.

By analyzing when web pages were gen erated, we were able to determine whether a proposition is true or false during a certain period and if it has been true or false from the past until now. The problems of our approach are that we do not distinguish positive sentences from negative sentences and that temporal analysis depends onWayback Machine and so once it ceases, we can not precisely determine when pages were generated. In a ddition, alternative terms constructed in Section 3 can be temporally affected by Yahoo! Search. That is, if the top 1,000 results are recent data, we can not get older alternative terms.
Our method is a kind of knowledge discovery process. We think that aggrega-tion of web knowledge can be applied not only to estimate the trustworthiness of a proposition but also to other problems. A part of our future work is to reduce the noise and to estimate trustworthiness of whole web pages rather than only their parts.
