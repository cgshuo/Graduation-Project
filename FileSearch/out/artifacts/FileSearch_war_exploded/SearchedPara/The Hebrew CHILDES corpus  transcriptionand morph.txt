 Abstract We present a corpus of transcribed spoken Hebrew that reflects spoken interactions between children and adults. The corpus is an integral part of the CHILDES database, which distributes similar corpora for over 25 languages. We introduce a dedicated transcription scheme for the spoken Hebrew data that is sensitive to both the phonology and the standard orthography of the language. We also introduce a morphological analyzer that was specifically developed for this corpus. The analyzer adequately covers the entire corpus, producing detailed correct analyses for all tokens. Evaluation on a new corpus reveals high coverage as well. Finally, we describe a morphological disambiguation module that selects the correct analysis of each token in context. The result is a high-quality morphologically-annotated CHILDES corpus of Hebrew, along with a set of tools that can be applied to new corpora.
 Keywords CHILDES Hebrew Transcription of spoken language Morphological analysis Morphological disambiguation 1 Introduction Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of computerized tools for processing natural languages with complex morphology. These tools serve language research-ers by providing them with an interface that enables quick and accurate analyses of large-scale corpora. This paper presents a corpus of transcribed spoken Hebrew that forms an integral part of a comprehensive data system that has been developed to suit the specific needs and interests of child language researchers: CHILDES [Child Language Data Exchange System; MacWhinney ( 2000 )].

CHILDES is a system of programs and codes designed to facilitate the process of naturalistic speech analysis. It involves three integrated components: 1. A system for discourse notation and coding called CHAT (Codes for the Human 2. A set of computer programs called CLAN (Computerized Language ANalysis), 3. A large, internationally recognized database of language transcripts formatted Researchers can directly test a vast range of empirical hypotheses against data from nearly one hundred major research projects in a wide variety of languages. Thus, although about half of the CHILDES corpus consists of English data, there is also a significant component of transcripts in over 25 other languages.

The CLAN software includes a language for expressing morphological gram-mars, implemented as a system, MOR , for the construction of morphological analyzers. 1 The main focus of the present paper is on the construction of a MOR grammar for Hebrew. Before examining this new system for Hebrew, however, it is important to understand why morphological analysis is so crucial for child language studies.

From its very beginning, the domain of language acquisition has put an emphasis on the development of grammatical competence. For example, the landmark analysis of the grammars of Adam, Eve, and Sarah (Brown 1973 ) focused on the determinants of the order of acquisition of 14 grammatical morphemes. This seminal work led to parallel studies in dozens of other languages which taught us how the sequence of acquisition of grammatical morphemes and parts-of-speech was conditioned by a variety of interesting formal and functional factors. This research is summarized in the chapters of Slobin X  X  7-volume series on the cross-linguistic study of language acquisition (Slobin 1985 ).
Eventually, various methods for morphological and part-of-speech analysis became codified in systems for assessment and diagnosis of language development, such as SALT (Miller and Chapman 1983 ), DSS (Lee 1974 ), LARSP (Crystal et al. 1976 ), and IPSyn (Scarborough 1990 ). A major limitation of all of these systems has been that they require idiosyncratic hand-crafted tagging and analysis of each word in a transcript. As a result, these methods are both time-consuming and error-prone. To address this problem, the MOR program for automatic analysis and part-of-speech tagging was introduced into the CHILDES system. To date, MOR analysis programs have been constructed for Cantonese, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, and Spanish. Once a child language corpus has been automatically tagged by MOR, it is then possible to automate various systems for assessment and diagnosis. Recent examples include automated computation of the DSS score for English and Japanese (Miyata et al. 2009 ; Miyata and MacWhinney 2011 ) and the IPSyn measure for English (Sagae et al. 2004 ).

Systems for further automatic analysis of child language corpora can also be grounded on processing of morphological information. In particular, syntactic (Dependency Grammar) analyzers that rely on MOR tagging were developed for English and Spanish (Sagae et al. 2010 ). These morphological and syntactic analyses form a platform for further work on grammar induction from CHILDES corpora, as represented in various new learning algorithms (Bannard et al. 2009 ; Borensztajn et al. 2009 ; Freudenthal et al. 2010 ; Waterfall et al. 2010 ). Together, these methods for automatic analysis of morphosyntactic development promise to advance the study of language acquisition to new theoretical levels.
 The current paper reports on the construction of a MOR system for Hebrew. Because of the richness of its allomorphic patterns and various orthographic complications, Hebrew poses a particularly interesting challenge to any system for automatic morphological analysis. We focus on the Hebrew section of the CHILDES database, and specifically on two major data-sets: the Berman longitudinal corpus, with data from four children between the ages of 1;06 and 3;05 (Berman and Weissenborn 1991 ), and the Ravid longitudinal corpus, with data from two siblings between the ages of 0;09 to around 6 years of age. The corpora consist of 114,632 utterances comprising of 417,938 word-tokens (13,828 word-types).

This paper makes three main contributions: we present a system for adequate transcription of the spoken utterances, and uniformly transcribe the two data-sets; we develop a highly accurate morphological grammar that is specifically designed for spoken Hebrew; and we present a disambiguation module that selects the correct analysis of ambiguous tokens in the context in which they occur. The main outcome of this work is therefore a morphologically-annotated corpus of spoken Hebrew, meticulously transcribed and annotated, which is already being used by several researchers of child language, language development, and language disorders. An additional outcome is a set of automated tools that can be used to accurately annotate new corpora with similar codes; such corpora are currently being transcribed, and we will apply the morphological analyzer and disambiguation module to more texts as they become available. This paper extends and revises several preliminary conference presentations (Nir et al. 2010 ; Albert et al. 2011 , 2012 ).

We discuss the transcription scheme in the following section, and the scope of the annotation in Sect. 3 . Section 4 details the morphological grammar; morphological disambiguation is the topic of Sect. 5 . Section 6 provides a robust evaluation of the results. Finally, Sect. 7 discusses the ways in which the annotated database is already being used, and concludes with suggestions for future research. 2 Transcription of spoken Hebrew data 2.1 Desiderata All data files in the CHILDES system are transcribed according to the CHAT format. This format allows researchers to decide whether they wish to apply orthographically-based transcription (as is, for example, the case for the English data-sets) or to rely on a phonemic representation of the speech data. The decisions involved in the transcription of data are not only technical but also theoretical (MacWhinney 2000 ), and have a direct impact on later stages of the research process, when the data are subject to computerized analysis. The three major goals which the CHAT format is designed to achieve are systematicity and clarity, ease of data entry, and human and computerized readability (MacWhinney 1996 ).

When dealing with Hebrew, relying on an orthographic representation of speech makes little sense. Hebrew is written from right to left; complex scripts are required for the full representation of vowels; and the representation of all phonemes is very different from the one used in Latin-based languages (Ravid 2012 ). The Hebrew script can be used in two variants: vocalized , where diacritics mark the vowels; and non-vocalized , where much of the vocalic information is missing. The vast majority of modern texts use the latter.

The non-vocalized Hebrew orthography (the standard Hebrew script) lacks prosodic information and includes a very limited range of vocalic information. This state of affairs, where orthographic forms are, in fact, sequences of letters denoting mostly consonants, increases the number of homographs in conventional Hebrew script (Ornan and Katz 1995 ; Wintner 2004 ). Take, for example, the orthographic form which can be read in the following ways: sayar a  X  X  X onvoy X  X ; sir a  X  X  X oetry/her poem X  X ; s ira  X  X  X hira (proper name) X  X ; se # yar a  X  X  X hat shot X  X . Conse-quently, any computerized system that is to handle written Hebrew data would have to take into account the highly ambiguous nature of its orthography (Yona and Wintner 2008 ).

The vocalized script solves the ambiguity problem but introduces a plethora of other problems. First, it uses diacritics, rather than alphabetic characters, to encode the vowels; this makes it difficult to specify morphological rules (Sect. 4) and to search the transcribed texts (search patterns can use variables to abstract over characters, but not over parts of characters). Second, the five-vowel system of Modern Hebrew is very different from the rich vowel system of biblical Hebrew, which is the one preserved in the orthography. Consequently, the standard diacritics encode redundant information and are therefore ambiguous. For example, indica-tions of schwa are sometimes pronounced as a vowel (e.g., the in [beros  X ] ) but sometimes not (the same in [bros  X ] ). Being able to make such distinctions is crucial for child-language research, where actual pronunciation of the elements in the utterance is the basis for studying all levels of linguistic development, from phonology and morphology to syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Third, as a result of the discrepancy between the pronunciation of Modern Hebrew and the (vocalized) orthography, Hebrew speakers are unable to correctly and consistently produce the vocalized script, and hence transcription using this representation is likely to be costly and inaccurate. 2.2 A hybrid transcription method In light of the above, we chose to transcribe the Hebrew data in the CHILDES system in a Latin-based phonemic transcription. Existing Hebrew transcription approaches either use a phonemic transcription (Ornan 1986 , 1994 ) or employ one-to-one transliterations. The former reflect the inherent features of the language but are hard to learn and use; the latter miss much of the information, in particular the vowels. In contrast to previous transcription methods, the current transcription relies on phonemic, prosodic, and orthographic features. It also consistently separates out phrasal (e.g., prepositional) and clausal (e.g., subordinating) functional elements that in Hebrew are orthographically prefixed to the following word.

The Hebrew data in the CHILDES database were collected by different researchers and were meant to serve various research purposes, involving morphology, lexicon, and syntax. Consequently, the various data-sets were highly inconsistent in terms of the transcription methods that were originally used. The first step was thus standardizing the transcription of the data. All files were semi-automatically re-transcribed to conform to a newly devised set of CHAT-compatible transcription conventions (Nir et al. 2010 ). Since CHAT conventions do not permit the use of special ASCII characters (e.g., $ &amp;, #) for representing consonants, we use a set of monoglyph Unicode characters (mostly in line with standard IPA conventions) that has already been applied for other complex scripts. Table 1 presents the complete set of transcription pairs. 2
The advantages of our approach are summarized below:  X  As illustrated above, phonemic transcriptions that include the five vowels of  X  At the same time, the Hebrew orthography retains valuable phonetic and phonemic  X  Recall that one of the possible readings for the Hebrew orthographic form
This final point reflects on one of the major issues involved in the transcription of spoken data, the question of what is a word. We discuss the various strategies we chose in order to handle this question in Sect. 2.3 .

Figure 1 shows a brief example of an interaction between a Hebrew-speaking child and her caretakers, transcribed in CHAT. Child and adult utterances are listed one in a line, in what is called the main tier . Each line begins with a specification of the speaker (e.g., CHI: for the target child, MOT: for the mother). The CHAT format uses several special characters, such as # to indicate a prefix, or [: ] to indicate the correct form when the actual utterance is mispronounced.

It is important to note that Hebrew speakers find the transcription straight-forward, and are able to read it with no training. Coding requires some minimal training, and in particular attention to details that are not present in the Hebrew orthography, such as stress; but lexicographers are able to transcribe new utterances reliably and fairly quickly. Coding errors can usually be detected due to the existence of a morphological analyzer: forms that cannot be analyzed are highlighted and can subsequently be inspected and corrected. Furthermore, conversion of our transcription to the standard (unvocalized) Hebrew script can be done automatically with high accuracy; we developed such a conversion program and use it for evaluation (see Sect. 6) Incidentally, the same issues were considered when the Japanese section of CHILDES was transcribed; in the case of Japanese, practiced transcribers prefer Roman, but students and new transcribers prefer Kana X  X anji. Japanese, too, has an automatic conversion script between the two representations.
 2.3 Lexical strategies As in any transcription method, including standard orthography, the question of  X  X  X hat is a word X  X  is critical. Several issues emerge here, such as those involved in the characterization of phonological versus orthographic words (as in the cases described above of homophonic ambiguity, on the one hand, and of functional items that in Hebrew are written either in adjacency to the following content words or are separated by spaces).

A major issue that reflects not only on semantic but also on syntactic acquisition is that of complex expressions that are written as strings containing more than one lexeme but that are considered by native speakers as constituting one lexical entry. Consider the following examples:
Multi Lexemic Expressions (MLEs) are sequences of words that together constitute one expression, or one complex syntactic entity (Sag et al. 2002 ). MLEs may combine words from different syntactic categories in various ways. In
CHAT, MLEs are transcribed with an underscore replacing space between words (e.g., sal at rax oq remote control X  X , l ayla t ov  X  X  X ood night X  X ).

Compounds are special cases of MLEs (Clark and Berman 1987 ) featuring initial lexicalized compounds at the early stages of acquisition and partially marked noun-noun combinations at around age 3 (Berman 2009 ), as well as noun-noun combinations in Construct-State in speech directed to children (Borer 1988 , 1996 ). The transcription convention dictates that compounds be separated by a  X  ?  X  sign instead of spaces (e.g., b eged  X  yam  X  X  X wimsuit X  X , xad ar  X  ok el  X  X  X ining room X  X ).

Merged forms are sequences involving proclitic particles (see Sect. 2.2 ) that are fully combined with the following word. Many Hebrew adverbs, for example, appear in such a construction, with the preposition be#  X  X  X n X  X  followed by an abstract noun [e.g., beq o si  X  X  X arely X  X = be # q o si  X  X  X n difficulty X  X , Nir and Berman ( 2010 )]. Merged forms are transcribed with no separation between morphemes: hay om  X  X  X oday X  X  versus ha# yom  X  X  X he day X  X .
 Unfortunately, there is no straight-forward way to know whether complex expressions should be divided into sequences of isolated lexemes versus one  X  X  X rozen X  X  lexical entity. While some cases may seem to be very clear in this respect, other cases corroborate claims that the degree of  X  X  X exicality X  X  of complex expressions runs on a scale (Berman 1979 ; Berman and Ravid 1986 ). Various criteria, such as loss of compositional meaning, can prove helpful in making the decision but they do not appear to constitute lexicality (consider the merged forms examples above, which are mostly compositional yet considered fully merged). The current corpora were re-transcribed to meet the following criteria. An expression is considered lexicalized if its meaning is idiomatic, or if it is highly conventional in use by Hebrew speakers. In order to determine whether a particular expression is to be treated as lexicalized, we consolidated the judgments of five linguistics undergraduate and graduate students, all native Hebrew speakers who went over lists of the various entries recognized by transcribers as possible complex lexical entries. Those expressions that were perceived as one item by the majority of judges were introduced into the system as fixed expressions.

In addition to MLEs, spoken language in general, and child language in particular, includes an abundance of forms that are idiosyncratic and inconsistent with standardized forms, such as onomatopoeias and other cases of ad-hoc productions (including child forms, filler syllables, unique diminutive forms etc.). CHAT conventions mark such special forms with a code preceded by  X  X  X , which is suffixed to the word (e.g., nad@c is recognized as a child form due to the @c special-form marker). It is also possible to automatically recognize capitalized words as proper nouns, in line with English orthography (e.g., Ron is analyzed as a proper noun due to its initial upper-case letter). Note that since the Hebrew transcript includes some non-Latin characters which bear no case distinctions, the special-form marker @z:pn achieves the same goal by automatically recognizing a word as a proper noun (e.g., eli @ z : pn  X  X  X li X  X ). Our corpora mainly use the special-form markers listed in Table 2 .
 3 Scope of the annotation Corpus annotation has become a major effort in recent years, both for linguistic research and for natural language processing applications. Text corpora can be annotated in a variety of ways, reflecting various levels of linguistic information. The Hebrew CHILDES data consist of transcribed spoken speech, and the choice of transcription adds yet another degree of freedom to the decision.

We opted for a transcription scheme that reflects morphological distinctions but does not provide narrow phonetic information, in line with the original transcription applied by researchers at the Berman Lab. We did, however, retain phonetic information when it was transcribed, especially in the case of child utterances, and standardized them using conventions available in CHAT. Note that the actual audio tapes on which the conversations were recorded are available, and we have very recently completed the process of digitizing them. Eventually, we would like to synchronize the recordings with the transcriptions, as was done for other languages.
The main focus of the present work is on morphological analysis and disambiguation. Having said that, we do intend to extend the corpora with syntactic information, in the form of grammatical (dependency) relations, in the near future; this work is currently underway. In their final form, then, the corpora will be of use to any linguist interested in the lexical, morphological, or syntactic processes involved in child language acquisition. Specifically, the annotated corpora will support three different lines of investigation: 1. Basic child language developmental research that examines the sequence of 2. Computational modeling of child language acquisition (Bannard et al. 2009 ; 3. Diagnosis of language differences and disorders through methods such as 4 Morphological analysis 4.1 Hebrew morphology Hebrew is a language with rich morphology both in terms of semantics and of systemics (Berman 1985 ; Ravid 2012 ). Some notions, such as Number, Gender, Person, and Tense, are obligatorily encoded as part of both content-and function-word structure; other notions, such as possession and objecthood, can be optionally expressed as morphemes rather than syntactically. Processes of inflectional morphology in Hebrew are realized either through affixation or through vocalic changes to the stem (ablaut).

For example, the verb kata  X  v  X  X  X rite X  X  appears in (1) in the base (citation) form, denoting masculine, 3rd person singular, in past tense. A change of person inflection, to the 1st person, yields the form kata  X  vti  X  X  X  wrote X  X  (2) by affixation. A write/s X  X  (3), illustrating a case of ablaut. 1. kat av  X  X  X e wrote X  X  2. kat av  X  ti  X  X  X  wrote X  X  3. kot ev  X  X  X /you/he/it write/s X  X 
The set of inflectional affixes in Hebrew is limited and mostly stable. In many cases, it is possible to predict which affix attaches to a given stem. However, this predictability is different for the verbal and nominal system, where the former is highly regular while the latter includes numerous cases of lexical exceptions. Thus, for nouns, the assignment of inflectional affixes (such as the two plural suffixes,  X  im and  X  ot ), as well as stress shifts and morphophonemic changes to the stem are not fully predictable. In many cases, the only way to predict such processes is by resorting to full Hebrew orthography, which preserves some inactive phonological distinctions that may motivate morphological processes. In other cases, only historical accounts may serve to explain and motivate changes that are otherwise completely opaque to speakers.
 As for derivational morphology, in accordance with most standard analyses of Semitic languages, it is widely assumed that many Hebrew stems (or bases ) are combinations of two non-linear morphemes: a sequence of consonants, often referred to as root or radic consonants, and a templatic sequence of vowels (and, optionally, consonants) with empty slots for root consonants, generally referred to as pattern , or more specifically binyan for verbs and mishkal for nouns (Ravid 2012 ). As an illustration, consider the consonantal sequence x.z.r . The basic verbal pattern CaCa  X  C yields the verb xaza  X  r  X  X  X eturn X  X , while the verbal pattern CiCe  X  C that denotes transitive activity yields the verb xize  X  r  X  X  X ourt X  X . Thus, the semantics of different words that share the same consonantal sequence, even when observed within the paradigmatic verbal system, may radically differ.

It should be noted that there is an ongoing debate on the reality of non-linear morphemes as active lexical entities in the grammar of Modern Hebrew speakers. In contrast to many common assumptions, some arguments draw on the universality of morphological systems, and current denominalization processes in Hebrew, to claim that the mental lexicon of Hebrew speakers consists of words, not vocalic patterns and consonantal sequences (Bat-El 1994 ; Ussishkin 1999 ). At the same time, several new studies show psycholinguistic evidence that the root or radic consonants are indeed active entities in the mental lexicon of Hebrew speakers (Shimron 2003 , chapter 1 and references therein). Our design of the Hebrew morphological analyzer is intended to be generally useful, regardless of a particular researcher X  X  viewpoint on the above-mentioned theoretical debate. 4.2 MOR devices Recall that the CLAN software includes a language for expressing morphological grammars, implemented as a computer program, MOR . Applying a MOR grammar to a CHILDES corpus creates a new tier below each main tier, called the %mor tier, in which the morphological information for each item in the main tier is listed. The output provides the surface representation of concatenated linear morphemes (stems ? affixes) and other morphological (and lexical) information attributed to the surface token. Figure 2 depicts a small fragment of a morphologically-annotated corpus.

A MOR grammar consists of three components: a set of lexical files specifying lexical entries (base lexemes) and lists of affixes; a set of rules that govern allomorphic changes in the stems of lexical entries ( A-rules ); and a set of rules that govern linear affixation processes by concatenation ( C-rules ).
 Different languages vary in their requirements and their need to utilize these MOR devices. The Dutch grammar, available on the CHILDES database ( http:// childes.psy.cmu.edu/morgrams/ ), includes a short list of possible allomorphic changes and several concatenation rules; the grammar for Italian includes a more elaborate A-rules file and a relatively short C-rules file; while the grammars for Cantonese and Mandarin rely almost exclusively on lexicon files. The Hebrew MOR extensively uses all of these devices: bases and affixes are noted in the lexicon files; the rich system of vocalic and consonantal changes of the stem allomorphs is handled within a set of A-Rules; and the proper affixation possibilities are allowed (or restricted) via the C-rules. We now introduce each of these devices in detail; for more information, see MacWhinney ( 2000 , 2008 ).
 4.2.1 Lexicon The Hebrew grammar is focused on inflectional morphology, rather than deriva-tional morphology. In this sense it is also in line with other Hebrew morphological analyzers, such as the MILA morphological analyzer of written Hebrew (Itai and Wintner 2008 ). Consequently, lexical entries are headed by lexemes (rather than root consonants, a design option that is possible in MOR) in a way that reflects the organization of printed dictionaries. As a result, lexical lists are uniform, more human-readable, and require fewer tags to correspond to the correct A-rule.
Example 1 depicts four lexical entries, one per line. Each entry is introduced by the base (citation) form. Then, in curly brackets, lexical features are specified. These include the main syntactic category ( scat ) of the item, as well as features such as root, pattern ( ptn ), grammatical gender ( gen ), etc. Also listed are features that are necessary for proper generation of the inflected forms of the entry. For example, Hebrew adjectives inflect for gender, and feminine variants are realized with a suffix. But the choice of suffix is lexically determined, and has to be specified explicitly; hence the value a for the feature fem of the adjective x am . In the same way, it is important to specify that m ayim  X  X  X ater X  X  is a mass noun, to prevent an erroneous attachment of the plural suffix. Finally, some features (e.g., vchng ) specify information that is used by the A-rules to generate the correct set of allomorphs; as noted above, this set, especially in the case of nouns, involves information that cannot be deduced from the form of the lexeme. In contrast, note that the verb system is so regular that no such information is needed; the entire inflectional paradigm of kat av  X  X  X rite X  X  is determined by its form. Lexical entries can also specify an English gloss, between  X = X  symbols.
 Example 1 (Lexical entries) 4.2.2 A-rules A-rules specify how to generate allomorphic variants from stems. An A-rule first specifies the lexical entries to which it applies. This can be done by specifying the actual surface form of the lexical entry (using LEXSURF ), or by listing some morpho-syntactic features, via LEXCAT . In Example 2, the LEXCAT specification constrains the rule to apply only to verbs whose pattern ( ptn ) is qal. Additionally, the LEXSURF specification indicates that this rule is only applicable to lexical entries whose surface form is given by the pattern $Qa$T a $L . This pattern makes use of variables , such as $Q and $T . Variables are defined separately, and their values can be constrained. In the Hebrew MOR grammar, the variables $Q , $T , and $L range over all consonants; other variables range over vowels, stressed vowels, gutturals, etc. Example 2 (A-rules)
Then, an A-rule specifies one or more allomorphs for the lexical entry. Example 2 shows two such allomorphs, one for first and second person past tense, and one for third person past. In the former, the surface form of the allomorph (indicated by ALLOSURF ) is exactly that of the lexical entry. In the latter, the second vowel of the lexeme is reduced. The ALLOCAT specification adds feature-value pairs to the ones that are associated with the lexical entry. This particular example, when applied to the lexeme kat av  X  X  X rite X  X  (Example 1), yields two allomorphs: kat av , with the feature X  X alue pairs { [scat v][root ktb][ptn qal][tense past][allo p1-}; and katv , with the feature-value pairs { [scat v][root ktb][ptn qal][tense past][allo p3] }. In order to generate the final forms, however, affixes may have to be attached to these allomorphs. This is achieved by C-rules. 4.2.3 C-rules All the linear inflectional morphology is handled within the C-rules, allowing a better division of labor in which the A-rules do not include linear affixation of inflectional categories, and surface representation of linear morphemes are readily visible to MOR.

C-rules use a lexicon of affixes, which specifies both the surface form and the morphological features of affixes. Example 3 depicts the lexicon entry of the suffix ? ti . Its syntactic category is determined to be pastsfx , as it is a past-tense suffix. It also carries with it the information that it is first person, singular, and unspecified for gender. Finally, it includes the specification [ allo p1-2 ]. This is part of a lock-and-key mechanism that controls which affixes combine with which allomorphs. Refer back to Example 2, and note that one of the allomorphs (but not both!) was also associated with [ allo p1-2 ]. Now, Example 3 also shows part of the specification of the rules that govern the combination of verbs with their past-tense suffixes. The rule states, through the MATCHCAT specification, that the allomorph and the suffix must have matching values for the feature allo. For the suffix ? ti , this is indeed the case with the allomorph kat av of Example 2, but not with katv . Hence the final form that will be generated by this specific rule when it applies to kat av is kat avti . This form will be associated with several feature-value pairs, as we show below.
 Example 3 (C-rules) 4.2.4 Putting it all together When MOR is invoked, it passes each lexical form past the A-rules. Importantly, the A-rules are strictly ordered. If a form matches a rule, that rule fires and the allomorphs it produces are generated. Then MOR moves on to the next lexical form, without considering any additional rules. This means that it is important to place more specific cases before more general ones in a standard bleeding relation. The C-rules, in contrast, are not ordered, and all possible combinations of affixes and allomorphs are attempted. Those combinations that survive MAATCHCAT specifications are propagated to the output.

As illustrated here, the lexical and morphological information that appears in the output of MOR can be added in various stages of the output derivation: it can be specified in a feature-value pair in the lexical entry; it can be added through an ADD operation in an A-rule; or it can be modified through an ADD or DEL operation in a C-rule. Some of this information is only required for proper derivation of correct forms, but is not specified in the output of the analyzer. The types of morphological information that are propagated to the output analysis are separately defined in a special file, the output file . This is crucial for the analysis of Hebrew, as it allows us to state features according to the specific needs and theoretical assumptions of the researcher. For example, information such as the root consonants is stated in the lexicon, and can be propagated to the output of MOR, thus allowing researchers the choice to decide whether they consider non-linear morphemes as separate morphemes or not. This choice has a significant impact on assessment of child language development, for example on the computation of mean length of utterance (MLU).

Example 4 shows the output of the morphological analyzer given the surface form kat avti . Each string on the MOR line begins with the main part-of-speech category; this is followed by the morphemes forming the surface form, and then by a sequence of feature-value pairs, separated by  X &amp; X -depending on the category being analyzed. Each string is terminated by the gloss, which is introduced by  X = X . Example 4 (Output format)
The analysis presented in Example 4 reflects the various morphological features relevant for Hebrew. Features that are listed in the output analysis ( root , ptn , tense , pers , gen , and num ) are individually stated in the output file. Note that the feature allo, which is added in the A-rule excerpt of that example, does not occur in the output analysis, as it is only needed for the inner-workings of MOR (more specifically, it is used to properly match stems and affixes within the grammar).
The Hebrew MOR grammar displays the following features in the output analysis: root The underlying root (when it is lexically specified, e.g., ktb ) ptn The underlying pattern (when it is lexically specified, e.g., nifal ) form Infinitive and imperative forms of verbs ( inf or imp ) tense Tense of verbs ( past , present or future ) pers Person of verbs, pronouns and pronominal clitics ( 1 , 2 , 3 , or unspecified) gen Gender of verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc. ( ms , fm ,or unsp ) num Number of verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc. ( sg , pl ,or unsp ) pl Type of plural suffix, which can be regular (  X  ot for forms that are morphologically marked as feminine,  X  im for unmarked forms) or irregular poss Possessive inflections of nouns (e.g., 2femSG , 3mascPL ) src The lexical source of content words (e.g., deverb , denom , foreign ) stat The status of nouns with respect to construct state morphology ( bound , free ,or unsp ) 4.3 A Hebrew MORphological grammar This section illustrates the operation of the Hebrew MOR grammar and provides examples for solutions that were required in order to handle challenges that emerged from the structure of the language. We begin (Sect. 4.3.1 ) with an overview of general design decisions. We then detail the grammars of two major word categories: verbs (Sect. 4.3.2 ) and nouns (Sect. 4.3.3 ). We review general phonological and orthographic processes in Sect. 4.3.4 , and discuss the overall organization of the grammar, including the minor part-of-speech categories, in Sect. 4.3.5 . 4.3.1 General design decisions The major challenge in devising a morphological grammar for Hebrew lies in accounting for the various changes that Hebrew stems undergo when they are inflected. In many cases, the vocalic patterns of stems change when affixes are added (as well as in cases of  X  X  X ure X  X  ablaut). These are morphophonemic changes within a given template X  X ot to be confused with the change of templatic patterns, which is a derivational process. Standard Hebrew orthography, which includes mostly conso-nants (and very few vowels), is usually oblivious to these changes in the stem, yet our Hebrew transcription convention, which includes phonemic, vocalic and prosodic information (such as vowels and stress assignments) is able to represent them. For the Hebrew MOR, such state of affairs shifts much of the word analysis burden into the A-rules, as it is the list of rules that governs the various stem allomorphs. 2. Rules that correspond to non-standard citation forms (i.e., feature a deviation 3. Rules that cannot be properly ordered via variables (due to morphologically Example 6 (Marked verbal entries) Since the unique behavior of this verb is not predictable from the segmental quality of the verb (there are no consonants that correspond to any pre-defined set of variables), it is necessary to add unique feature-value matching pairs to both the lexical entry and the corresponding A-rule. 4
Only rules that are listed as  X  X  X arked X  X  have to bear unique features that would allow the right lexical entry to correspond to an A-rule. Consequently, the vast majority of verbal lexical entries do not need to bear any unique features beyond the general lexical information that each verb is given. 4.3.3 The nominal system Compared to the verbal system, the nominal system in Hebrew is more irregular. While nouns in Hebrew obligatorily inflect only for gender [when gender is biologically determined, see Ordan and Wintner ( 2005 )] and number (except for some irregular cases) through suffixation, some highly frequent lexical exceptions do occur, where a noun that is morphologically marked as feminine is assigned the plural suffix that commonly fits masculine nouns, and vice versa (Ravid et al. 2008 ). Like other entities in MOR, suffixes bear feature-value pairs that ensure proper matching with other MOR entities. Thus, these cases are handled by specifying unique features in the A-rules and on entries in the lexicon files. In addition to the irregularity of suffixation, the changes in the vocalic pattern (and stress assignment) that nominal stems undergo when inflected can only be partially predicted by phonological or orthographic regularities. These morphophonemic alternations can often be explained only diachronically and they are unpredictable on the surface.
All the affixes in the nominal system are suffixed to the base. Initially, it seemed reasonable to associate each inflectional categ ory with its own distinctive feature, and assign the same value to any set of suffixes that would always fit the same allomorph together. Consider, for example, the set of (optional) singular possessive suffixes (Example 7). When inflected for some si ngular possessive conjugation, a regular noun, possessive suffixes (both (a) and (b) in Example 7). However, in many other cases the inflecting nouns require differe nt allomorphs to match (a) and (b). Such is the case of the noun som er  X  X  X uard X  X : the allomorph som er fits (a) while the allomorph som er fits (b). Example 7 (Nominal suffixes)
In order to handle this issue, we first assigned the feature suff1 to the set of singular possessive suffixes (plural possessive suffixes receive the feature suff2 ). This allowed us to give sets (a) and (b) two distinctive values, say a and b , respectively. This works well for the A-rule corresponding to som er  X  X  X uard X  X , since there are two different allomorphs that attach to each set (see Example 8). Example 8 (Preliminary nominal attachments)
However, this architecture is not appropriate when applied to nouns where only one allomorph attaches to both sets of possessive suffixes, as in the case of noun kid on  X  X  X pear X  X . The problem is that both set (a) and (b) share the same feature ( suff1 ) and allomorphs in the A-rules can state a certain feature only once (it is impossible to state both ADD [suff1 a] and ADD [suff1 b] for the same allomorph).

To solve this issue, we switch the lock-and-key unification mechanism of feature-value pairs: we group all the subsets of suffixes that always attach together to the same allomorph, and create a different feature that identifies that group alone. Instead of assigning distinctive values to a shared feature , we assign distinctive features to a shared value . Therefore, we can assign the feature suff1a to set (a) and the feature suff1b to set (b). We also assign the value 11 to both features. This allows the allomorph kidon ? to state both ADD [suff1a 11] and ADD [suff1b 11] for the same allomorph. It is thus possible to allow any allomorphic stem in the A-rules to state any group of possibly fitting suffixes, since they never repeat the same feature.

Consider Example 9. Three allomorphs of the stem s efer  X  X  X ook X  X  are listed, each stating different matching groups of suffixes, with different features: [suff0] , [suff1a] , [suff1b] , [suff2a] , [suff2b] , and [suff3] (here, 0 indicates plural, 1 indicates singular possessive, 2 indicates plural possessive, and 3 indicates construct state). All allomorphs contain the same value, [11] , which is shared by all nouns that do not inflect for gender and take the plural suffix ? im .
The allomorph sfar , the value of ALLOSURF , fits two subsets of suffixes, specified under ALLOCAT : suff0 for plural inflections (e.g., sfar  X  im  X  X  X ooks X  X ) suff2a for plural possessive inflections (e.g., sfar  X  ay  X  X  X y books X  X )
Similarly, the allomorph sifr fits three subsets of suffixes: suff1a for singular possessive inflections (e.g., sifr ? i  X  X  X y book X  X ) suff2b for plural possessive inflections (e.g., sifr ? eyk em  X  X  X our books X  X ) suff3 for plural construct-state inflections (e.g., sifr ? ey  X  X  X ooks of X  X )
Finally, the allomorph sifre fits one subset of suffixes: suff1b for singular possessive inflections (e.g., sifre ? k a  X  X  X our book X  X ) Example 9 (Nominal suffix subsets)
Compare Example 9 with Example 10, where only two allomorphs are listed, taking different subsets of suffixes. Example 10 (Nominal suffix subsets) 4.3.4 Variables of phonological and pseudo-phonological classes Our system of variables is designed to represent phonological natural classes in Hebrew, as well as pseudo-phonological classes that are only reflected in the orthography of the language (Sect. 2 ). Morphophonemic alternations can be often predicted in accordance with phonological natural classes. For example, two seemingly similar stems may be expected to behave differently under inflection, if only one of them contains a (pseudo-)guttural consonant. The following is a list of such variable classes (signs between curly brackets represent our transcript). Stops and fricatives: { p|b|k }/{ f|v| k g The historical spirantization rule in Hebrew alternates between stop and fricative consonants (in general: fricative consonants appear after a vowel, stops appear elsewhere). In Modern Hebrew, a triplet of stop-fricative alternation still exists pervasively with a set of three stop-fricative pairs, each represented by the same letter:  X  The Hebrew letter denotes a voiceless labial stop { p } or fricative { f },  X  The Hebrew letter denotes a voiced labial stop { b } or fricative { v }, phonemic /  X  The Hebrew letter denotes a voiceless velar stop { k } or fricative f k g ,
In order to allow our analyzer to identify th is alternation and to recognize different surface forms as belonging to the same ste m, we define two sets of consonants X  X ne set ( P ) that includes all consonants minus th efricativetriplet,andanotherset( F ) that includes all consonants minus the stop triplet. With in the variable definition, all consonants are listed in the same order, while the alternating t riplet are located in identical positions in each set. We then use variable-shift in the A-rules to determine which set of consonants should appear in each allomorphic occurrence. If non-alternating consonants enter this rule nothing happens X  X  consonant from one set is  X  X  X eplaced X  X  by the counterpart consonant from the other set (which is of c ourse the same consonant). If, however, an alternating consonant is subjected to the rule , then it is replaced by its counterpart from the other set. We thus obtain an automatic account of spirantization pro cesses in the rules.
Example 11 demonstrates this solution. The A-rule is designed to account for possible stop-fricative alternations in the 1st and 2nd positions, using MOR X  X  ability to switch between variables with the X&lt;Y syntax. The denotation of this operation is: replace the n th member from Y in the LEXSURF with the n -th member from X in the ALLOSURF .

The base (or citation) form, which is the form of the lexical entry, is stated as the value of LEXSURF , while ALLOSURF represents one of the stem X  X  allomorphs. Note that an alternating consonant in the first position would appear as a stop (variable P ) in the base form (e.g., kat av  X  X  X e wrote X  X ), but as a fricative (variable F ) in the inflected form (e.g., yi + k t ov  X  X  X e will write X  X ). Likewise, an alternating consonant in the second position would appear as a fricative (variable F ) in the base form (e.g., sav al  X  X  X e suffered X  X ) but as a stop (variable P ) in the inflected form (e.g., yi  X  sb ol  X  X  X e will suffer X  X ). Crucially, only alternating consonants can alternate with these two variables, leaving all the other non-alternating consonants intact. Example 11 Lexical spirantization (alternating segments are underlined)
Our design of A-rules with spirantization processes also allows us to handle systematic variation effects within verbal paradigms. Hebrew speakers often do not follow the required sound change for a  X  X  X roper X  X  stop-fricative alternation. This may happen regularly at some specific consonantal positions within verbal paradigms (Adam 2002 ). Certain allomorphs are therefore repeated twice such that the targeted position for alternation appears once with the required sound change, and again without change. Consider Example 11 above. The allomorph that the rule produces may change the first and the second consonants, if they belong to the spirantization triplet. The first consonant normally exhibits this change when possible, yet the second consonant tends to vary in that position, and often appears without change. Example 12 below extends the previous example with two different allomorphs. Importantly, although all the allomorphs of an A-rule are active at the same time, the rule does not create duplicate representations, i.e., the allomorph of verbs with no spirantization-able consonant in their second position will not be generated twice. Example 12 Stop-fricative variation Guttural consonants: Another historical phonologically-motivated alternation concerns the class of gutturals, which, in many cases, trigger vowel lowering in their environment. In Modern Hebrew they do not form a natural class, since the pharyngeal consonants (denoted by the Hebrew letters { x } and ) are not pronounced as pharyngeals ( = h = and = /, respectively), and the glottal consonants (denoted by the Hebrew letters { } and { h }) are often not pronounced at all. As with the spirantization rule, alternations concerning guttural consonants are only fully manifested in Hebrew orthography (not in its phonology).

Note that while most of the letters in this group often denote a null consonant (they are not pronounced in rapid speech), the consonant denoted by the letter { x } is always pronounced (as a velar fricative that never participates in spirantization trigger the expected vowel lowering around it, in positions where the other pseudo-gutturals always do. To account for this kind of variation, two classes of guttural consonants were defined: one with { x }, and another one without.
 Consider Example 13: the -initial basic verb as a  X  X  X ake X  X  of the two ordered A-rules, which predicts only one allomorph for that conjugation, with a vowel between the first two consonants of the stem. Having fired the first rule, MOR will not proceed to the following rule (which would potentially create a duplicate analysis). At the same time, the { x }-initial word xac a  X  X  X ross X  X  triggers only the second rule, which, for the same conjugation, predicts a variation (two allomorphs) in the appearance of a low vowel (/a/) between the first two consonants of the stem. Example 13 (Pseudo-guttural distinction) Sonorants: { y|l|m|n|r } Another class of phonemes that impacts its surroundings within the word it the class of sonorants. Hebrew speakers follow a phonotactic restriction whereby sonorants must be adjacent to vowels. Instead of producing consonant clusters (a phenomenon that is more tolerated in Modern Hebrew compared to, for example, Biblical Hebrew), a simpler syllabic structure is favored when the first member of a consonantal sequence is a sonorant. Thus, potential consonantal clusters that violate sonority-driven phonotactic restrictions in Hebrew may trigger morpho-phonemic changes which we can properly predict.

In order to allow the analyzer to recognize different syllabic structures as belonging to the same word pattern, a class of sonorants was defined. The A-rules are ordered such that the more specific version (the one targeting a sonorant) is the first, and the more general rule follows it. Lexical entries with a sonorant in relevant positions trigger the first A-rule and not the general rule. Other entries trigger only the general rule.

Consider Example 14: the sonorant-initial word y eled  X  X  X id X  X  triggers the first of two A-rules, which predicts a vowel between the first two consonants in the plural inflection. The obstruent-initial word k elev  X  X  X og X  X  triggers only the second rule, which, for the same inflection, predicts a word-initial consonant cluster. Example 14 (Sonority restriction) Coronal stops: { d|t| t } When Hebrew stems end with a coronal stop (/t/ or /d/) they may immediately precede the coronal stop /t/, which is the initial consonant of some verbal suffixes ( ? ti , ? ta , ? tem , ? ten , etc.) In such cases, a phonotactic restriction requires a vowel insertion that would break the identical (or similar) sequence of stops. This is a standard scenario of an Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP) effect (Leben 1973 , 1978 ; McCarthy 1986 ) in Hebrew. Again, to allow the morphological analyzer to recognize this complementary distribution, a class of coronal stops was defined. Lexical entries with a stem-final coronal stop trigger the A-rule that identifies that final stem consonant instead of the general rule that comes next.
In Example 15, the coronal-final stem lak ad  X  X  X apture X  X  triggers the first of two ordered A-rules, which predicts a vowel between that consonant and an immediately following suffix initial /t/. The non-coronal-final stem daf aq  X  X  X nock X  X , on the other hand, triggers only the 2nd (general) rule.
 Example 15 (OCP effects) Stridents / Sibilants: Strident (or sibilant) consonants trigger a phonological rule of metathesis in a certain position of the hitpael paradigmatic template X  X hen it is in the first consonantal slot, immediately following the /t/ of the hitpael pattern ( hitCaCe  X  C ). In these metathesis cases, the coronal consonant that is part of the stem X  X  pattern may not only switch places with the following stem consonant, but also change to one of the other coronal stops, t or f d g . Again, these phenomena stem from phonological assimilation processes of Biblical Hebrew that are no longer fully active in Modern Hebrew. The analyzer is able to recognize these alternations as belonging to the same verb pattern within the A-rule itself (with no need for additional rules or for rule ordering) since such metathesis cases are distinct already at the level of LEXSURF (i.e., the surface form of the lexical entry).
Compare the LEXSURF values of the two excerpts in Example 16. The special form of basic verbs that fit the first rule is distinct from the form of verbs that fit the second (more general) rule.
 Example 16 Metathesis 4.3.5 Other grammatical categories The discussion above focused on verbs and nouns, because these are the part-of-speech categories for which inflectional morphology is most productive. 335 A-rules were developed for nouns, and 572 for verbs. Yet other grammatical categories require similar solutions as well. We developed 47 rules for adjectives, 26 for prepositions, 6 for adverbs, 5 for pronouns, and 18 for forms of the copula hay a  X  X  X e X  X . Rules are organized in separate files according to the POS category they apply to; the verbal rules are further divided into five files, one for each tense/form (see Sect. 4.3.2 ). Nominal rules are further divided into six files according to the phonological structure of the nouns they apply to.

To illustrate other grammatical categories, consider adjectives. Hebrew adjec-tives inflect for gender and number. The base form is the masculine singular form; the feminine suffix is lexically determined (and can be  X  a , ? et , ? at ,or  X  it ). The addition of a suffix can trigger segmental and/or prosodic changes in the stem.
As an example, consider the adjective gad ol  X  X  X ig X  X , whose lexical entry is listed in Example 17. Subsequent to the specification of the POS category ( scat adj ), this entry lists the feminine suffix ( fem a ), followed by an indication of a vowel change ( vchange 1 ). Example 17 further specifies the rule that generates the allomorphs of this adjective. The variables $Q , $T and $L are matched against the root consonants of the lexeme (here, g.d.l ). The LEXCAT specification matches the features of the lexical entry, and hence this rule applies. Then, two allomorphs are generated: one for the base form, with no change in the surface form; and one for the feminine and plural suffix. In the second allomorph, note the change in the stress pattern, and the $V&lt;O specification, indicating that the stressed vowel is replaced by its unstressed counterpart. This is due to the fact that the feminine and plural suffixes carry inherent stress. The resulting forms are gad ol ; gdol a ; gdol im ; gdol ot . Example 17 (Adjectives)
Very similar rules were also developed for prepositions (which, in Hebrew, can combine with pronominal suffixes, in a very similar way to nouns), pronouns, and the few inflecting adverbs. 4.4 Results The main result of our work is a properly and uniformly transcribed, morpholog-ically annotated CHILDES corpus of Hebrew. As mentioned above, the corpus includes the Berman longitudinal corpus, with data from four children between the ages of 1;06 and 3;05, and the Ravid longitudinal corpus, with data from two siblings between the ages of 0;09 to around 6 years of age. Together, the corpora consist of 114,632 utterances comprising of 417,938 word-tokens (13,828 word-types).

The MOR lexicon includes approximately 5,200 entries, in 16 part-of-speech categories (and, additionally, 700 affixes). 5 Table 3 lists the number of lexical entries in the main POS categories.

Lexically-specified information includes root and pattern (for verbs mainly), gender (for nouns), plural suffix (for nouns), and other information that cannot be deduced from the form of the word. Over 1,000 A-rules describe various allomorphs of morphological paradigms, listing their morphological and morphosyntactic features, including number, gender, person, nominal status, tense, etc. Lexical entries then instantiate the paradigms described by the rules, thereby generating specific allomorphs. These, in turn, can combine with affixes via over 100 C-rules that govern the the possible combinations of allomorphs involved in affixation.
The corpora include over 400,000 word tokens (about 14,000 types). More than 27,000 different morphological analyses are produced for the tokens observed in the corpus; however, we estimate that the application of the morphological rules to our lexicon would result in hundreds of thousands of forms, so that the coverage of the MOR grammar is substantially wider. The grammar fully covers our current corpus. As noted, the corpora and the MOR grammar are freely available from the CHILDES repository. Figure 2 above depicts a small fragment of a morphologi-cally-annotated corpus. 5 Morphological disambiguation As noted in Sect. 2 , the level of ambiguity of our data is much lower than that of the standard Hebrew script, especially due to the vocalic information encoded in the transcription. However, while most orthographic and phonemic ambiguity is resolved, morphological ambiguity still remains, as the MOR grammar associates each surface form with all its possible analyses, independently of the context. Such ambiguity arises especially with items that could belong to more than one lexical category (typically in cases of syntactic conversion or zero derivation as is common in English). In Hebrew, such cases involve mostly participial or present tense forms. Thus, the string som er (see Example 8 above) can stand for both the noun guard and the verb guard . In spoken data, this type of ambiguity extends even further, since words can function not only as nouns, verbs, or adjectives but also as adverbs and as communicators (e.g., y ofi  X  X  X eauty/great! X  X , t ov  X  X  X ood/OK X  X ). Such items are highly frequent in interaction in general and in child-parent interactions in particular. Another type of ambiguity that remains involves cases where two forms representing different morpho-lexical or grammatical categories share the same pronunciation and spelling. For example, in the future tense paradigm, 2nd person masculine singular and 3rd person feminine singular take the same prefixal and stem forms across all verb pattern conjugations (e.g., tel ek means either you-Masc-Sg will-go or she will-go ). Finally, some ambiguous word forms are the result of completely accidental processes, as in eqd ax , which can mean either the noun gun , or the verb I will-drill .

Such ambiguous entries require disambiguation before the data can be applied to analysis. Following the application of MOR, each ambiguous analysis appears with the caret separating the possible analyses, as in Example 18.
 Example 18 (Ambiguity)
In CLAN, a dedicated mode is available for manual disambiguation within context, a time consuming process that involves many on-line decisions, some of which are easily handled, and others that result in inconsistencies. CLAN also provides users with an automatic module, POST, that can be trained on a given corpus and used as a part-of-speech tagger on unseen data. In order to train POST, a developed a set of guidelines for manual morphological disambiguation. This allowed us to make the decisions regarding unclear cases more internally consistent. Following are some of the most frequent guidelines that were used for our data:  X  For any word that is ambiguous with a communicator analysis ( co ), that analysis  X  When a word can be analyzed as either a noun ( n ) or an adjective ( adj ) (e.g., xa  X  When some word is ambiguous between adjectival and adverbial ( adv ) analyses,  X  When a word is ambiguous between a quantifier ( qn ) and adverbial analyses, it  X  When the participle form of verbs ( part ) is ambiguous with an adjective,  X  When the participle form of verbs is ambiguous with another form of that verb
Following these guidelines, we manually disambiguated 18 of the 304 files in the corpus. This was done by two lexicographers, and all disagreements were consolidated by a third annotator. 6 We used 14 of the manually-disambiguated files to train the part-of-speech tagger with tools that are embedded in CLAN ( POSTRAIN and POST ). We then automatically disambiguated the remaining files. The results of this endeavor are a single morphological analysis for each token in the corpus. The accuracy of the morphological disambiguation is evaluated in the next section. 6 Evaluation As noted above, the MOR grammar fully covers the forms in our corpus. To further evaluate its coverage, we applied it to a new corpus that is currently being transcribed. Of the 10,070 tokens in the new corpus, 176 (1.75 %) do not obtain an analysis (77 of the 1431 types, or 5.3 %). This provides a rough estimate as to the coverage of the lexicon and the MOR grammar. Of course, there are no guarantees that the provided analyses are indeed correct; but manual inspection of the first 1,000 tokens in the new corpus reveals that over 90 % of them are indeed valid. The missing analyses can be attributed mostly to missing lexical entries and inconsistent transcription (this is the case with 66 of the 77 unanalyzed entries). The remaining 11 types are missing in MOR X  X  lexicon . As more Hebrew corpora are being transcribed, we are certain that lexical gaps and any remaining MOR omissions and inaccuracies will soon be amended.

As another evaluation method, we developed a program that converts the transcription we use to the standard Hebrew script. While our transcription is rich, and includes both consonantal and vocalic information (some of which, recall, is missing in the standard Hebrew script), such a conversion is not trivial, and in some cases cannot be done deterministically. Yet it generates the correct form in the vast majority of cases. We then submit the Hebrew forms to the MILA morphological analyzer (Itai and Wintner 2008 ), a state-of-the-art morphological tool for (standard, written) Hebrew, and compare the results of the two analyzers. The MILA analyzer operates on non-vocalized forms, and does not perform disambiguation; we therefore only check that the MOR analysis is included in the set of analyses produced by MILA.

For various reasons, the conversion program only works on 340,212 word tokens (for example, child neologisms, fillers, onomatopoeia etc. are excluded). Of those, 38,481 mismatches with MILA (11.3 %) are reported. Again, we manually inspected the mismatches in one file (2,023 tokens, 214 mismatched tokens but only 85 mismatched types). While a few mismatches (5 out of 85) indeed indicate errors in the MOR grammar, or discrepancies between the two analyzers (8 due to incompatible part-of-speech assignment, and 10 due to incompatible morphological features assignment), most of the 214 mismatches are attributable to problems with the MILA analyzer or the conversion and comparison script.

Furthermore, 27 of the 85 mismatches are due to forms unique to the CHILDES corpus (e.g., the verb lefax ed  X  X  X ear X  X , whose standard form is lifx od ); and 6 are due to errors in the transcription (e.g., the proper name eitan is transcribed Eitan , without the initial consonant/letter, and is therefore wrongly converted to the standard script). 8 more mismatches are due to MOR-specific conventions: 5 mismatches are due to MOR X  X  analysis of multi-lexemic expressions (see Sect. 2.3 ); and 3 mismatches are due to MOR X  X  unique completion part-of-speech category.
Finally, to evaluate the accuracy of the part-of-speech tagger (more precisely, the morphological disambiguation module), we trained the tagger on the fourteen manually annotated files (the training corpus), and used it on the other four manually disambiguated files (the test corpus). The test corpus contains 8,871 tokens, of which 1,631 are ambiguous. Of those, the wrong analysis was selected in 306 of the tokens, or 19 %, bringing the overall accuracy of the tagger to 1 -306/ 8871 = 96.6 %. Note that we do not distinguish between child-and adult-speech in this analysis; presumably, the adult utterances produce less error. We intend to manually disambiguate the entire corpus in the future, and use it in its entirety as a training corpus. 7 Discussion We described a properly and uniformly transcribed, morphologically-annotated CHILDES corpus of Hebrew. We believe that the corpus will be instrumental for future investigations of Hebrew child-and child-directed language, language development and psycholinguistics in general. The corpora are all freely available from the main CHILDES repository.

Furthermore, we described a morphological analyzer specifically developed for this corpus. The analyzer, too, is freely distributed from the CHILDES web site; it is already used to process more corpora that are currently being transcribed by several research groups working on Hebrew child language.

For example, the data described in the current paper are used in an ongoing study of the acquisition of noun plurals, examining both the distributions of plural morphemes and the correspondence between child and adult output. Another ongoing project examining the relationship between adult input and child output is focusing on the Hebrew verbal system, with new densely recorded corpora that were transcribed and analyzed following the guidelines specified here. Yet another study involves a developmental analysis of the lexicon of Russian-Hebrew sequential bilingual children, where data were re-transcribed to allow for automatic analysis of lexical categories. And another ongoing study, which examines the development of complex syntax in children X  X  narratives and dyadic conversations and interviews, relies heavily on the morphological analysis provided by MOR in order to locate conjunctions and to trace complex verb phrases.

Our ultimate plan is to add syntactic annotation to the transcripts. We have devised a syntactic annotation scheme, akin to the existing scheme used for the English section of CHILDES (Sagae et al. 2007 , 2010 ), but with special consideration for Hebrew constructions that are common in the corpora. We have recently begun to annotate the corpora according to this scheme.
