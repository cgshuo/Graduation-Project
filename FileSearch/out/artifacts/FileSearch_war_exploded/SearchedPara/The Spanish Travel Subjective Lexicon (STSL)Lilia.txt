 The lack of studies relative to polarity analysis in the Spanish language is one of the motivations for this re-search because it is the fourth largest language spo-ken in the world with 6.9 million speakers. The auto-matic analysis of the appraisal in text corpora has sig-nificantly advanced in recent years. There are propos-als of language codification that have been developed based on relatively reliable tools. Unfortunately, most developments are carried out only in English. Transla-tion is not always a good solution and that is specially evident in the case of translating polarity. For exam-ple, it would be necessary to face a translation of ev-ery polarity word in English with the uncertainty that the cultural weight of each language does not suppose a modification of the polarity expression in the same way. Likewise, it would not be possible to translate some elements such as phrases, sayings, and popular expressions in a particular culture. (Gelbukh et al., 2002) said that analyzing a traditional corpus of texts has the disadvantage that few words occur many times thus using most of the processing time. In addition, the majority of interest words when appraisal or polarity are concerned have few or no representation in some of the existing corpora. This limits the study of word contexts. One solution to this problem is the use of the web which can be regarded as a large virtual cor-pus. It has sufficient information in order to study the properties of a large number of words. But this vir-tual corpus has some disadvantages compared to the traditional ones such as: the network response time, unstable results in time, etc. The corpus that has been examined in this research combines the advantages of both types, virtual and locally stored. Since it is cre-ated from the web where we find all kinds of material that can be stored in order to analyze the properties of a particular type of texts, in this case travel blogs. It is possible to gain access to stories narrated by many people simply by choosing the topic. For this research we chose to extract texts from travel blogs since they are an inexhaustible source of good material for the study of the language of appraisal. As by their nature they are personal experiences, these stories have a very strong subjectivity. But they also have the component that the authors want not only to convey their travel experiences, but also evaluate the places visited. This includes the things they have seen or the people they have met in order to advise future travellers about what to do or not do, what to see and not to see, where to eat or not to eat, where to sleep or not to sleep, etc. We see it as an ideal source to extract polarity because almost everything is based on opinion. These stories are very different compared to a travel guide where the narra-tive is much more objective, full of facts and with very few evaluations (Gonz  X  alez Rodr  X   X guez, 2011). The aim of this project is double; on the one hand, the creation of a corpus of travel blogs that can be by itself a useful tool for a linguistics corpus and on the other hand, a study of the value patterns in the sentences, using the corpus of text previously created for this purpose. In this way, we can propose a computational model for to estimate the polarity of the sentence. The proposed model is based on the following phases: (1) To recog-nize the polarity elements (words or groups of words) in a sentence within the corpus, (2) To recognize cer-tain grammatical structures also indexed in the lexicon, (3) To establish rules that switch the polarity elements or polarity structures, (4) To obtain a semantic sum of the polarity elements. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the Spanish Travel Subjective Lexicon (STSL) approach. Section 4 presents details of our data sets, evaluation metrics and the result. Finally, Section 5 presents our conclusions and future research. We understand appraisal theory as the discursive construction of attitude and intersubjective posture (P  X  erez Nieto and Redondo Delgado, 1997). This ap-proach is a term of wide scope, that includes all evalu-ative uses of the language through which speakers and writers not only bring particular value attitudes but also negotiate these positions with their actual and potential interlocutors (Kaplan, 2004).

Following the work of (Kaplan, 2004) and using her examples and terminology, we will discuss the way in which appraisal theory is divided into three semantic domains: attitude, compromise, and gradation. 2.1 Attitude The attitude domain includes the meanings by which the texts or speakers attribute a value or an intersubjec-tive appraisal to the participants and processes. These can be related to both emotional answers and with value systems that are culturally determined. All state-ments are classified as attitudinal if they convey an evaluation both positive and negative, or can be inter-preted as an invitation to the reader to provide their own negative or positive evaluations
This category is divided into affect, judgment and appreciation subsystems.

Affect Affection is the evaluation of how the writer indicates his or her emotional disposition towards per-sons, things, situations or events. The emotions are concentrated in three major groups that deal with hap-piness or unhappiness; safety and insecurity; and sat-isfaction or dissatisfaction. The linguistic indicators of affection can be verbs of emotion that refer to mental processes (eg.: to love / hate); adverbs that indicate circumstances of mood (e.g.: happily and sadly); ad-jectives that express emotion (e.g. : happy/sad), and nominalizations, i.e. transformations of verbs and ad-jectives into nouns (e.g.: happiness / desperation).
Judgment Judgment can be understood as the insti-tutionalization of emotions in the context of rules on how people should and should not behave. The social norms that act into these appraisal judgements take the form of regulations or social expectations.

Judgments of social esteem are subdivided into: (a) relative to normality, (b) the capacity or the determina-tion demonstrated in the conduct; all are evaluated in order to know how normal is a person, how competent or how decisive and determined he or she is, and (c) judgments of social sanction related to the veracity and moral integrity.
 Appreciation
Appreciation can be considered as the system where human assessment is expressed toward products, pro-cesses and entities that are valued positively or nega-tively. Artefacts, texts, abstract ideas, plans and poli-cies, and objects are evaluated according to polarity. Individuals can also be evaluated through appreciation, but only when they are perceived as entities and not as humans. The STSL approach has seven stages: (1) search for texts, (2) text selection, (3) building of textual docu-ments, (4) tagging of travel blogs on the web, (5) clas-sification of data, (6) indexation, and (7) analysis of appraisal patterns. Then a database is created in order to save or delete lexical elements. As a result, we have a corpus of text, appraisal sentences, and an appraisal lexicon that will be later used for the analysis of ap-praisal patterns.

Search for Texts Our text is a travel forum, with a section for blogs. There are many entries, although not all meet the characteristics of inclusion in our corpus, either due to incomplete or general ideas or any other type of feature. STSL allows access to blogs and the possibility to search by title, user or by continent. Next we found that the blog is structured in two parts: (a) the most recently published diaries, and (b) most pop-ular daily entries depending on the number of visits. The method of search was random, since texts did not fulfill all the selection features of the blogs. It was nec-essary to perform a tracing process, examining many blogs and performing a preliminary inspection of all of them one by one. Then STSL selected and discarded irrelevant blogs.

Text Selection The quality of the corpus is mea-sured by the degree of compliance of the documents that meet the purpose for which the corpus is compiled. Thus it was necessary to take special care in the selec-tion of documents attempting to maintain homogeneity. Therefore, it was necessary to establish the following criteria that govern the selection and inclusion of docu-ments. (a) Quantity: It was decided to include 24 blogs of different dimensions. The total number of words collected was 201.678. (b) Quality of text: Given that the selection was manual, special care was taken in that the texts were written in the correct language, with-out spelling mistakes, in clear writing. (c) Published in travel blogs: Due to the nature of the project, we only included published blogs, discarding blogs in restricted personal pages. (d) Type of travel: the trip must have been carried out as a tour, following a route or path, i.e. through a single country or region as a whole (for ex-ample we recognize Scandinavia as a region although it includes three countries, or the westerm United States given its extensive area ). (e) Text form: The texts must be written in the form of logs or diaries, discarding the texts of general impressions of a journey for its lack of detail. (f) Style: The texts must be comprehensive, describing the journey from beginning to end, discard-ing free or incomplete texts introduced in unfinished or abandoned blogs. (g) Additional information: Each sample must be marked with a series of additional data, which gives extra information and allows for identifica-tion. These marks are the: web page from which it has been extracted, country or area where the trip has been realized, language, date of the trip, date of creation of the blog, and name of the author or nickname.

Building of Textual Documents Once the 24 blogs were selected, they were copied and included in doc-uments for accommodation in the database. We found additional difficulty with some personal blogs where each day of the trip was on different web pages and we needed to browse all the links by using an index.
Tagging of Travel Blogs on the Web Sentences with appraisal value we marked with colours, blue for positive and pink for negative.

Clasification of data Each sentence was extracted from the word or group of words that function as an appraisal element, classifying it into existing cat-egories using the drop-down categories. Grammati-cal categories were defined in advance but are subject to changes.The classification included the concept of  X  X radation X  where our approach allows to select a word and those associated with it that can modify its value either intensificating or weaken.

Indexation To accommodate the corpus and have the versatility and functionality required, it was de-cided to create a relational database containing: (a) The texts of each of the blogs. (b) All appraisal sentences classified as positive or negative. (c) All the appraisal elements of each sentence and its grammatical classifi-cation. (d) The established object, person or situation from the emitted evaluations.

Analysis of Appraisal Patterns First we studied the lexical items that indicate the ability to infer rules that permit automated recognition of the evaluation. This allowed us to recognize polarity, i.e. positive or neg-ative elements. We can divide the lexical elements of the corpus in two large groups. On the one hand, words or groups of words that have a fixed structure and can be easily recognized. In this group are adjec-tives, verbs, adverbs, nouns and phrases. We call these elements  X  X xplicit appraisal elements X . On the other hand are the elements, they are included in sentences with a clear polarity but that are subjective or complex to recognize, because sentence structure is variable or the nature of the assessment is not evident in any of its elements. We call these elements  X  X mplicit appraisal el-ements X  are items that we cannot identify due to its se-mantic complexity . Irony is that property of speech by which speakers understand the opposite of what is said; this only is identified by using context, which makes it impossible to know the elements that indicate irony. We study the explicit appraisal elements based on their frequency of occurrence in sentences. We see that the greater weight of the appraisal is in adjectives, which is logical since the adjective is an element specifically designed to assess. Next are the nouns, verbs and ad-verbs. Our approach evaluated 24 blogs consisting of 345 pages that contain a total of 201,678 words. We ex-tracted from them 4,183 sentences and 6,295 lexical elements as shown in Fig. 1.

The explicit appraisal elements are shown in Table I, they constitute a total of 95% of all items that contain polarity, in contrast to 5% implicit appraisal elements.
The adjectives represent 48% of the total explicit ap-praisal elements. Some examples of adjectives in su-perlative degree which appear in the corpus are adjec-tives that already appear in the list of appraisal adjec-tives and include the prefix  X  X uper X . Considering gra-dation when it accompanies explicit adjectives it does not change polarity since it only reinforces the positive or negative value of the specific adjective. The most common graders are:  X  X   X  as, mas o menos, mucho, mu-cho m  X  as, muy o bien, tan, bastante, algo X , etc. The nouns represent 48% of the total explicit appraisal el-ements. The verbs represent 14% of the total explicit appraisal elements. The adverbs represent 7% of the to-tal explicit appraisal elements. The most used adverbs or greater number of repetitions are shown in Table II.
They represent 4% of the total and include the iden-tify margin of error. In the same way, we found in the corpus, evaluative nouns that are created by adding a suffix to the corresponding adjectives like  X -idad X  or  X -ez X . In this way, the appraisal noun  X  X ajestuosi-dad X  would be the evaluative adjective  X  X ajestuoso X  or of the appraisal noun  X  X apidez X  would be the adjec-tive  X  X   X  apido X  by adding the corresponding suffixes. It would be possible to extend the list of nouns, by utiliz-ing the appraisal adjectives, with their corresponding endings of nouns, identifying all the possible endings. However, given the variety of sufixes and not all adjec-tives can be transformed into nouns. For this study, we have extended the list of nouns only for those adjec-tives that appear in the corpus sample. The appraisal of the entire corpus by country with its polarity is shown in Fig. 2.

In this study, the blog writers value the following the most: Appraisal theory can be considered as related to senti-ment analysis. The application of this type of analysis has many possibilities, but all of them are based on sen-tence polarity recognition. Our model also accounts for the possibility of modifying the original value by means of a negative word. In this case, the possible negations must be located within the context of the sen-tence:  X  X o, X   X  X or, X   X  X either, X   X  X ithout, X   X  X one, X  and  X  X ever, X  as well as any double negations that are dealt with as one:  X  X o/nor neither, X   X  X o/nor none, X   X  X o/nor never, X   X  X ithout nothing, X  and  X  X ithout any. X  If there are negations then the coefficient will change its sign by being multiplied by menus one (1). Then, the links with coordinated sentences should be sought:  X  X ut, X   X  X espite X  and  X  X lthough. X  If there are more than one of these, then the following rules are applied: positive (P)  X  X ut X  negative (N) = negative; N  X  X ut X  P = P; P  X  X e-spite X  N = P; N  X  X espite X  P = N; P  X  X lthough X  N = P; N  X  X lthough X  P = N;  X  X lthough X  P, N = N;  X  X lthough X  N, P = P;  X  X lthough X  P, N = N;  X  X lthough X  N, P = P. It is possible to extend the number of appraisal words in our lexicon through the transformation of lexical cate-gories into others by applying the relevant suffixes. We have observed that in most cases it is the root that has the appraisal meaning; thus, we can conclude that if  X  X lad X  is an appraisal adjective then  X  X ladder X  is an ap-praisal adjective too. Extension is also possible using techniques that were based on expanding lists of basic words to full lexical terms with the recursive consulta-tion of synonymous words using electronic dictionar-ies.
