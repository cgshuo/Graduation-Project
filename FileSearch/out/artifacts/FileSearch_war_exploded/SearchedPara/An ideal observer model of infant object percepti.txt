 Over the past few decades, ingenious experiments [1, 2] have suggested that infants rely on sys-tematic expectations about physical objects when interpre ting visual scenes. Looking time studies suggest, for example, that infants expect objects to follow continuous trajectories through time and space, and understand that two objects cannot simultaneous ly occupy the same location. Many of these studies have been replicated several times, but there is still no consensus about the best way to characterize the knowledge that gives rise to these findings .
 Two main approaches can be found in the literature. The verbal approach uses natural language to characterize principles of object perception [1, 3]: for example, Spelke [4] proposes that object perception is consistent with principles including continuity ( X  X  moving object traces exactly one connected path over space and time X ) and cohesion ( X  X  moving object maintains its connectedness and boundaries X ). The mechanistic approach proposes that physical knowledge is better charac -terized by describing the mechanisms that give rise to behav ior, and researchers working in this tradition often develop computational models that support their theoretical proposals [5]. We pursue a third approach X  X he ideal observer approach [6, 7, 8] X  X hat combines aspects of both previous traditions. Like the verbal approach, our primary goal is to characterize principles that account for infant behavior, and we will not attempt to characterize the mechanisms that produce this behavior. Like the mechanistic approach, we emphasize the importance of formal models, and suggest that these models can capture forms of knowledge that are difficul t for verbal accounts to handle. Ideal observer models [6, 9] specify the conclusions that no rmatively follow given a certain source of information and a body of background knowledge. These mod els can therefore address questions about the information and the knowledge that support perception. Approaches to the information question characterize the kinds of perceptual information that human observers use. For example, Geisler [9] discusses which components of the information a vailable at the retina contribute to vi-sual perception, and Banks and Shannon [10] use ideal observ er models to study the perceptual consequences of immaturities in the retina. Approaches to t he knowledge question characterize the background assumptions that are combined with the availabl e input in order to make inductive infer-ences. For example, Weiss and Adelson [7] describe several e mpirical phenomena that are consistent with the a priori assumption that motions tend to be slow and s mooth. There are few previous at-tempts to develop ideal observer models of infant perceptio n, and most of them focus only on the information question [10]. This paper addresses the knowle dge question, and proposes that the ideal observer approach can help to identify the minimal set of pri nciples needed to account for the visual competence of young infants.
 Most verbal theories of object perception focus on categori cal principles [4], or principles that make a single distinction between possible and impossible scene s. We propose that physical knowledge in infancy is also characterized by probabilistic principl es, or expectations that make some possible scenes more surprising than others. We demonstrate the impo rtance of probabilistic principles by focusing on two examples: the rigidity principle states that objects usually maintain their shape and size when they move, and the inertia principle states that objects tend to maintain the same patt ern of motion over time. Both principles capture important regula rities, but exceptions to these regularities are relatively common.
 Focusing on rigidity and inertia allows us to demonstrate tw o contributions that probabilistic ap-proaches can make. First, probabilistic approaches can rei nforce current proposals about infant perception. Spelke [3] suggests that rigidity is a core prin ciple that guides object perception from a very early age, and we demonstrate how this idea can be captur ed by a model that also tolerates ex-ceptions, such as non-rigid biological motion. Second, pro babilistic approaches can identify places where existing proposals may need to be revised. Spelke [3] a rgues that the principle of inertia is slow to develop, but we suggest that a probabilistic version of this principle can help to account for inferences made early in development. An ideal observer approach to object perception can be formu lated in terms of a generative model for scenes. Scenes can be generated in three steps. First we c hoose the number n of objects that will appear in the scene, and generate the shape, visual appe arance, and initial location of each object. We then choose a velocity field for each object which s pecifies how the object moves and changes shape over time. Finally, we create a visual scene by taking a two-dimensional projection of the moving objects generated in the two previous steps. An ideal observer approach explores the idea that the inferences made by infants approximate the optimal inferences with respect to this generative model.
 We work within this general framework but make two simplifica tions. We will not discuss how the shapes and visual appearances of objects are generated, and we make the projection step simple by working with a two-dimensional world. These simplification s allow us to focus on the expectations about velocity fields that guide motion perception in infant s. The next two sections present two prior distributions that can be used to generate velocity fields. T he first is a baseline prior that does not incorporate probabilistic principles, and the second inco rporates probabilistic versions of rigidity and inertia. The two priors capture different kinds of knowl edge, and we argue that the second provides the more accurate characterization of the knowled ge that infants bring to object perception. 1.1 A baseline prior on velocity fields Our baseline prior is founded on five categorical principles that are closely related to principles discussed by Spelke [3, 4]. The principles we consider rely o n three basic notions: space, time, and matter. We also refer to particles , which are small pieces of matter that occupy space-time poi nts. Particles satisfy several principles: An object is a collection of particles, and these collection s satisfy two principles: Suppose that we are interested in a space-time window specifi ed by a bounded region of space and a bounded interval of time. For simplicity, we will assume tha t space is two-dimensional, and that the space-time window corresponds to the unit cube. Suppose tha t a velocity field ~v assigns a velocity ( v x , v y ) to each particle in the space-time window, and let ~v i be the field created by considering only particles that belong to object i . We develop a theory of object perception by defining a prior distribution p ( ~v ) on velocity fields.
 Consider first the distribution p ( ~v 1 ) on fields for a single object. Any field that violates one or mor e of principles C1 X  X 5 is assigned zero probability. For insta nce, fields where part of an object winks out of existence violate the principle of temporal continui ty, and fields where an object splits into two distinct pieces violate the principle of cohesion. Many fields, however, remain, including fields that specify non-rigid motions and jagged trajectories. Fo r now, assume that we are working with a space of fields that is bounded but very large, and that the pr ior distribution over this space is uniform for all fields consistent with principles C1 X  X 5: Consider now the distribution p ( ~v 1 , ~v 2 ) on fields for pairs of objects. Principles C1 through C5 rule out some of these fields, but again we must specify a prior dist ribution on those that remain. Our prior is induced by the following principle: More formally, the independence principle specifies how the prior for the multiple object case is related to the prior p ( ~v 1 ) on velocity fields for a single object (Equation 1): p ( ~v 1 , . . . , ~v n )  X  f ( ~v 1 , . . . , ~v n ) = 1.2 A smoothness prior on velocity fields We now develop a prior p ( ~v ) that incorporates probabilistic expectations about the mo tion of phys-ical objects. Consider again the prior p ( ~v 1 ) on the velocity field ~v 1 of a single object. Principles C1 X  X 5 make a single cut that distinguishes possible from imp ossible fields, but we need to consider whether infants have additional knowledge that makes some o f the possible fields less surprising than others. One informal idea that seems relevant is the not ion of persistence [11]: things tend to remain the same, and when they change they do so gradually. We focus on two versions of this idea that may guide expectations about velocity fields: A field is  X  X mooth in space X  if neighboring particles tend to h ave similar velocities at any instant of time. The smoothest possible field will be one where all par ticles have the same velocity at any instant X  X n other words, where an object moves rigidly. Th e principle of spatial smoothness therefore captures the idea that objects tend to maintain th e same shape and size.
 A field is  X  X mooth in time X  if any particle tends to have simila r velocities at nearby instants of time. The smoothest possible field will be one where each particle m aintains the same velocity throughout the entire interval of interest. The principle of temporal s moothness therefore captures the idea that objects tend to maintain their initial pattern of motion. Fo r instance, stationary objects tend to remain stationary, moving objects tend to keep moving, and a moving object following a given trajectory tends to continue along that trajectory.
 Principles S1 and S2 are related to two principles X  rigidity and inertia  X  X hat have been discussed in the developmental literature. The rigidity principle st ates that objects  X  X end to maintain their size and shape over motion X  X 3], and the inertia principle states that objects move smoothly in the absence of obstacles [4]. Some authors treat these principles rathe r differently: for instance, Spelke suggests that rigidity is one of the core principles that guides objec t perception from a very early age [3], but that the principle of inertia is slow to develop and is weak or fragile once acquired. Since principles S1 and S2 seem closely related, the suggestion that one devel ops much later than the other seems counterintuitive. The rest of this paper explores the idea t hat both of these principles are needed to characterize infant perception.
 Our arguments will be supported by formal analyses, and we th erefore need formal versions of S1 and S2. There may be different ways to formalize these prin ciples, but we present a simple Figure 1: (a) Three scenes inspired by the experiments of Spe lke and colleagues [12, 13]. Each scene can be interpreted as a single object, or as a small obje ct on top of a larger object. (b) Relative preferences for the one-object and two-object interpretat ions according to two models. The baseline model prefers the one-object interpretation in all three ca ses, but the smoothness model prefers the one-object interpretation only for scenes L1 and L2. approach that builds on existing models of motion perceptio n in adults [7, 8]. We define measures of instantaneous roughness that capture how rapidly a veloc ity field ~v varies in space and time: where O ( t ) is the set of all points that are occupied by the object at time t , and vol ( O ( t )) is the volume of the object at time t . R space ( ~v, t ) will be large if neighboring particles at time t tend to have different velocities, and R time ( ~v, t ) will be large if many particles are accelerating at time t . We combine our two roughness measures to create a single smoo thness function S (  X  ) that measures the smoothness of a velocity field: where  X  space and  X  time are positive weights that capture the importance of spatial smoothness and temporal smoothness. For all analyses in this paper we set  X  space = 10000 and  X  time = 250 , which implies that violations of spatial smoothness are penalize d more harshly than violations of temporal smoothness. We now replace Equation 1 with a prior on velocit y fields that takes smoothness into account: Combining Equation 6 with Equation 2 specifies a model of obje ct perception that incorporates probabilistic principles of rigidity and inertia. There are many experiments where infants aged 4 months and yo unger appear to make inferences that are consistent with the principle of rigidity. This sec tion suggests that the principle of spatial smoothness can account for these results. We therefore prop ose that a probabilistic principle (spatial smoothness) can explain all of the findings previously prese nted in support of a categorical principle (rigidity), and can help in addition to explain how infants p erceive non-rigid motion.
 One set of studies explores inferences about the number of ob jects in a scene. When a smaller block is resting on top of a larger block (L1 in Figure 1a), 3-month-olds infer that the scene includes a single object [12]. The same result holds when the small and l arge blocks are both moving in the same direction (L2 in Figure 1a) [13]. When these blocks are mo ving in opposite directions (U in Figure 1a), however, infants appear to infer that the scene c ontains two objects [13]. Results like these suggest that infants may have a default expectation th at objects tend to move rigidly. We compared the predictions made by two models about the scen es in Figure 1a. The smoothness model uses a prior p ( ~v 1 ) that incorporates principles S1 and S2 (Equation 6), and the baseline model is identical except that it sets  X  space =  X  time = 0 . Both models therefore incorporate principles C1 X  C6, but only the smoothness model captures the principle of s patial smoothness.
 Given any of the scenes in Figure 1a, an infant must solve two p roblems: she must compute the velocity field ~v for the scene and must decide whether this field specifies the m otion of one or two objects. Here we focus on the second problem, and assume that the infant X  X  perceptual system has already computed a veridical velocity field for each scene th at we consider. In principle, however, the smoothness prior in Equation 6 can address both problems . Previous authors have shown how smoothness priors can be used to compute velocity fields give n raw image data [7, 8].
 Let H 1 be the hypothesis that a given velocity field corresponds to a single object, and let H 2 be the hypothesis that the field specifies the motions of two objects . We assume that the prior probabilities of these hypotheses are equal, and that P ( H 1 ) = P ( H 2 ) = 0 . 5 . An ideal observer can use the posterior odds ratio to choose between these hypotheses: Equation 7 follows from Equations 2 and 6, and from approxima ting P ( ~v | H 2 ) by considering only the two object interpretation ( ~v A , ~v B ) with maximum posterior probability. For each scene in Fig-ure 1a, the best two object interpretation will specify a fiel d ~v A for the small upper block, and a field ~v B for the large lower block.
 To approximate the posterior odds ratio in Equation 7 we comp ute rough approximations of R the supporting material, we consider all fields that can be bu ilt from objects with 5 possible shapes, 900 possible starting locations, and 10 possible trajector ies. For computational tractability, we con-vert each continuous velocity field to a discrete field defined over a space-time grid with 45 cells along each spatial dimension and 21 cells along the temporal dimension.
 Our results show that both models prefer the one-object hypo thesis H 1 when presented with scenes L1 and L2 (Figure 1b). Since there are many more two-object sc enes than one-object scenes, any typical two-object interpretation is assigned lower prior probability than a typical one-object inter-pretation. This preference for simpler interpretations is a consequence of the Bayesian Occam X  X  razor. The baseline model makes the same kind of inference ab out scene U, and again prefers the one-object interpretation. Like infants, however, the smo othness model prefers the two-object in-terpretation of scene U. This model assigns low probability to a one-object interpretation where adjacent points on the object have very different velocitie s, and this preference for smooth motion is strong enough to overcome the simplicity preference that makes the difference when interpreting the other two scenes.
 Other experiments from the developmental literature have p roduced results consistent with the prin-ciple of spatial smoothness. For example, 3.5-month olds ar e surprised when a tall object is fully hidden behind a short screen, 4 month olds are surprised when a large object appears to pass through a small slot, and 4.5-month olds expect a swinging screen to b e interrupted when an object is placed in its path [1, 2]. All three inferences appear to rely on the e xpectation that objects tend not to shrink or to compress like foam rubber. Many of these experiments ar e consistent with an account that simply rules out non-rigid motion instead of introducing a g raded preference for spatial smoothness. Biological motions, however, are typically non-rigid, and experiments suggest that infants can track and make inferences about objects that follow non-rigid tra jectories [14]. Findings like these call for a theory like ours that incorporates a preference for rig id motion, but recognizes that non-rigid motions are possible. We now turn to the principle of temporal smoothness (S2) and d iscuss some of the experimental evidence that bears on this principle. Some researchers sug gest that a closely related principle (inertia) is slow to develop, but we argue that expectations about temporal smoothness are needed to capture inferences made before the age of 4 months.
 Baillargeon and DeVos [15] describe one relevant experimen t that explores inferences about moving objects and obstacles. During habituation, 3.5-month-old infants saw a car pass behind an occluder and emerge from the other side (habituation stimulus H in Fig ure 2a). An obstacle was then placed in the direct path of the car (unlikely scenes U1 and U2) or bes ide this direct path (likely scene L), and the infants again saw the car pass behind the occluder and emerge from the other side. Looking Figure 2: (a) Stimuli inspired by the experiments of [15]. Th e habituation stimulus H shows a block passing behind a barrier and emerging on the other side. Afte r habituation, a new block is added either out of the direct path of the first block (L) or directly in the path of the first block (U1 and U2). In U1, the first block leaps over the second block, and in U 2 the second block hops so that the first block can pass underneath. (b) Relative probabilit ies of scenes L, U1 and U2 according to two models. The baseline model finds all three scenes equally likely a priori, and considers L and U2 equally likely after habituation. The smoothness model c onsiders L more likely than the other scenes both before and after habituation. Figure 3: (a) Stimuli inspired by the experiments of Spelke e t al. [16]. (b) Model predictions. After habituation to H 1 , the smoothness model assigns roughly equal probabilities to L and U. After habituation to H 2 , the model considers L more likely. (c) A stronger test of the inertia principle. Now the best interpretation of stimulus U involves multiple changes of direction. time measurements suggested that the infants were more surp rised to see the car emerge when the obstacle lay within the direct path of the car. This result is consistent with the principle of temporal smoothness, which suggests that infants expected the car to maintain a straight-line trajectory, and the obstacle to remain stationary.
 We compared the smoothness model and the baseline model on a s chematic version of this task. To model this experiment, we again assume that the infant X  X  per ceptual system has recovered a veridical velocity field, but now we must allow for occlusion. An ideal o bserver approach that treats a two dimensional scene as a projection of a three dimensional wor ld can represent the occluder as an object in its own right. Here, however, we continue to work wi th a two dimensional world, and treat the occluded parts of the scene as missing data. An ideal obse rver approach should integrate over all possible values of the missing data, but for computational s implicity we approximate this approach by considering only one or two high-probability interpreta tions of each occluded scene. We also need to account for habituation, and for cases where t he habituation stimulus includes oc-clusion. We assume that an ideal observer computes a habitua tion field ~v H , or the velocity field with maximum posterior probability given the habituation stimu lus. In Figure 2a, the inferred habituation field ~v H specifies a trajectory where the block moves smoothly from th e left to the right of the scene. We now assume that the observer expects subsequent velocity fields to be similar to ~v H . Formally, we use a product-of-experts approach to define a post-habitu ation distribution on velocity fields: that field ~v is drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered on ~v H . Intuitively, after habituation to ~v H the second expert expects that subsequent velocity fields wi ll be similar to ~v H . More information about this model of habituation is provided in the supportin g material.
 Given these assumptions, the black and dark gray bars in Figu re 2 indicate relative a priori proba-bilities for scenes L, U1 and U2. The baseline model consider s all three scenes equally probable, but the smoothness model prefers L. After habituation, the b aseline model is still unable to account for the behavioral data, since it considers scenes L and U2 to be equally probable. The smoothness model, however, continues to prefer L.
 We previously mentioned three consequences of the principl e of temporal smoothness: stationary objects tend to remain stationary, moving objects tend to ke ep moving, and moving objects tend to maintain a steady trajectory. The  X  X ar and obstacle X  task addresses the first and third of these proposals, but other tasks provide support for the second. M any authors have studied settings where one moving object comes to a stop, and a second object starts t o move [17]. Compared to the case where the first object collides with the second, infants appe ar to be surprised by the  X  X o-contact X  case where the two objects never touch. This finding is consis tent with the temporal smoothness principle, which predicts that infants expect the first obje ct to continue moving until forced to stop, and expect the second object to remain stationary until forc ed to start.
 Other experiments [18] provide support for the principle of temporal smoothness, but there are also studies that appear inconsistent with this principle. In on e of these studies [16], infants are initially habituated to a block that moves from one corner of an enclosu re to another (H1 in Figure 3a). After habituation, infants see a block that begins from a dif ferent corner, and now the occluder is removed to reveal the block in a location consistent with a straight-line trajectory (L) or in a location that matches the final resting place during the habi tuation phase (U). Looking times suggest that infants aged 4-12 months are no more surprised by the ine rtia-violating outcome (U) than the inertia-consistent outcome (L). The smoothness model, how ever, can account for this finding. The outcome in U is contrary to temporal smoothness but consiste nt with habituation, and the tradeoff between these factors leads the model to assign roughly the s ame probability to scenes L and U (Figure 3b).
 Only one of the inertia experiments described by Spelke et al . [16] and Spelke et al. [1] avoids this tradeoff between habituation and smoothness. This experim ent considers a case where the habitua-tion stimulus (H2 in Figure 3a) is equally similar to the two t est stimuli. The results suggest that 8 month olds are now surprised by the inertia-violating outco me, and the predictions of our model are consistent with this finding (Figure 3b). 4 and 6 month olds, h owever, continue to look equally at the two outcomes. Note, however, that the trajectories in Figur e 3 include at most one inflection point. Experiments that consider trajectories with many inflectio n points can provide a more powerful way of exploring whether 4 month olds have expectations about te mporal smoothness.
 One possible experiment is sketched in Figure 3c. The task is very similar to the task in Figure 3a, except that a barrier is added after habituation. In order fo r the block to end up in the same location as before, it must now follow a tortuous path around the barri er (U). Based on the principle of temporal smoothness, we predict that 4-month-olds will be m ore surprised to see the outcome in stimulus U than the outcome in stimulus L. This experimental design is appealing in part because previous work shows that infants are surprised by a case simi lar to U where the barrier extends all the way from one wall to the other [16], and our proposed exper iment is a minor variant of this task. Although there is room for debate about the status of tempora l smoothness, we presented two rea-sons to revisit the conclusion that this principle develops relatively late. First, some version of this principle seems necessary to account for experiments like t he car and obstacle experiment in Fig-ure 2. Second, most of the inertia experiments that produced null results use a habituation stimulus which may have prevented infants from revealing their defau lt expectations, and the one experiment that escapes this objection considers a relatively minor vi olation of temporal smoothness. Additional experiments are needed to explore this principle, but we pre dict that the inertia principle will turn out to be yet another example of knowledge that is available e arlier than researchers once thought. We argued that characterizations of infant knowledge shoul d include room for probabilistic expecta-tions, and that probabilistic expectations about spatial a nd temporal smoothness appear to play a role in infant object perception. To support these claims we desc ribed an ideal observer model that in-cludes both categorical (C1 through C5) and probabilistic p rinciples (S1 and S2), and demonstrated that the categorical principles alone are insufficient to ac count for several experimental findings. Our two probabilistic principles are related to principles (ri gidity and inertia) that have previously been described as categorical principles. Although rigidity an d inertia appear to play a role in some early inferences, formulating these principles as probabilisti c expectations helps to explain how infants deal with non-rigid motion and violations of inertia.
 Our analysis focused on some of the many existing experiment s in the developmental literature, but new experiments will be needed to explore our probabilistic approach in depth. Categorical versions of a given principle (e.g. rigidity) allow room for only two k inds of behavior depending on whether the principle is violated or not. Probabilistic principles can be violated to a greater or lesser extent, and our approach predicts that violations of different magn itude may lead to different behaviors. Future studies of rigidity and inertia can consider violati ons of these principles that range from mild (Figure 3a) to severe (Figure 3c), and can explore wheth er infants respond to these violations differently. Future work should also consider whether the c ategorical principles we described (C1 through C5) are better characterized as probabilistic expe ctations. In particular, future studies can explore whether young infants consider large violations of cohesion (C5) or spatial continuity (C2) more surprising than smaller violations of these principle s.
 Although we did not focus on learning, our approach allows us to begin thinking formally about how principles of object perception might be acquired. Firs t, we can explore how parameters like the smoothness parameters in our model (  X  space and  X  time ) might be tuned by experience. Second, we can use statistical model selection to explore transitio ns between different sets of principles. For instance, if a learner begins with the baseline model we c onsidered (principles C1 X  X 6), we can explore which subsequent observations provide the stro ngest statistical evidence for smoothness principles S1 and S2, and how much of this evidence is require d before an ideal learner would prefer our smoothness model over the baseline model. It is no t yet clear which principles of object perception could be learned, but the ideal observer approac h can help to resolve this question.
