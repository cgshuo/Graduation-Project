 Some time has elapsed since I last addressed the re aders of SIGKDD Explorations from this forum. It is with particularly great pride and excitement that I do so this time. Your newsletter has undergone a change in primary editorial leaders hip and is moving to the next stage on its evolution to being an established and well-read publication. With this issue Explorations , the role of Editor-in-Chief has been fully transitioned to Sunita Sarawagi. In addition , much of the primary associate editor work is now solidly in the hands of Paul Bradley. Both Sunita and Paul have been doing an outstanding job with Explorations for the past two years as Associate Editors. In fa ct, they have taken much of the load off me  X  so much s o that I have done very little in the past year. This is as it sh ould be when very energetic and motivated leadership joins an organiz ation. Sunita and Paul have been exemplary associate editors and have proven that they deserve my trust and more importantly the trust of the SIGKDD Executive Committee. I am certain also that through their performance over the last two yeas, they have gained the trust of the SIGKDD membership and the community at large. At KDD-2003 in Washington, D.C. we announced that S unita would take over the Editor-in-Chief role. Sunita al so addressed the community during the SIGKDD business meeting an d briefly described some of her plans for the newsletter. I b elieve she and Paul will continue to provide excellent leadership and will take this newsletter to new heights. It is my hope that the membership and the community will work with them in making Explorations a success and in helping it to advance the sense of c ommunity and scholarship in this field. Stay tuned for further d evelopments and additions to the editorial team over the next few m onths as I am sure Sunita will be updating you on these developme nts. From my side, I would like to express my deep gratitude and admiration for their exemplary service over the past 2 years. With the close of the year 2003, we close our fifth year of SIGKDD as an ACM organization. The KDD conference i s now in its ninth year as an international conference, a nd in its 15 th year meeting in the series. The conference has proven to be a steady and healthy conference, with attendance exceeding 7 00 people. More importantly, it has maintained a high quality track record for research papers, workshops, tutorials, and events s uch as the KDD Cup. It is an extremely competitive forum for publi cation, with less than a 10% acceptance rate for research papers . It is more difficult to publish a research paper in KDD than m ost other conference, and certainly more difficult than publi shing in the majority of technical journals. The KDD conference has continued to grow and improve in quality despite th e proliferation of alternative conferences in the U.S. and internat ionally. The emergence of other major conferences is a very heal thy sign for the field in my opinion. On the other front, the journal: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery has also continued to grow. Now in its eighth year in publication, the journal has recently expanded from 4 issues per year to 6: Another healthy growth sign for the com munity. Other activities by the SIGKDD EC and its subcommittees, especially the Curriculum Committee chaired by Jiawei Han are further signs of healthy and disciplined growth on the academic f ront. More encouraging to me is the observation that most top universities now have established formal tracks or curricula foc used on KDD and Data Mining. With the ease of capturing and storing data, large databases and massive data sets and warehouses have become the no rm. aradoxically, despite the proliferation of large da ta stores, it is a rare event to find an organization that is actually benefiting from its data assets. About 5 years ago I wrote that mos t large data warehousing projects appear to be failing to delive r value to their owners, and I called them  X  X rite-only X  stores. Unfo rtunately, this fact has not changed much since that writing; in fa ct the situation has been has been getting worse by the month. Sadly , the analogy of the typical data store to a data tomb , where data is deposited to rest undisturbed and unused remains very appropriat e today. We continue to exist in an environment that is driv ing the need for the kinds of technologies and applications that the KDD field is poised to address. Our fundamental problems are one s that are becoming increasingly important to society, by the day, because of the ever-growing cache of data in each organizat ion. With the continued proliferation of the digitization of tran sactions, workflows, and processes: be it in science, busines s, government, communications, or security, one axiom appears to c ontinue to hold true: growth in stored digital data seems to b e keeping a surprisingly fast pace  X  a pace whose trend eclipse s Moore X  X  law. While these large untapped resources present a huge opportunity for our field, I would be very concerned if we, as a community, do not contribute in a significant way to impact this environment in a major way over the next few years. While, admittedl y, progress in research and science is typically slow, we need to ensure that at least some of the advances we have been developing in the KDD field start gaining serious deployments in practica l systems. I see this need for true deployments of the new tec hnology as the prime challenge for our community to make itself re levant. Another challenge is to continue to attract contrib utions and advances from researchers and practitioners in rela ted fields, including statistics, databases, optimization, AI a nd machine learning, and visualization. There are many relevan t areas in applications. These are too many to list but includ e: bioinformatics, genomics, physics, many disciplines in science data analysis, as well as computer/network security and systems. Without gaining the attention and involvement of pe ople from these related communities, we all stand to lose muc h. In my opinion, one key to attracting involvement of other communities is to have a clearly elucidated set of contributions and well-understood challenge problems. I believe w e face many challenges on two primary fronts: the pragmatic (or practical) front as well as on the technical (or theoretical) front. Work in KDD and data mining has been taking place along so many areas and on so many fields that it is difficult to asses s progress in a coherent way. While having much activity without a coherent centralized theme is perfectly acceptable and natur al in a young field like ours, I believe that this should not pre vent us from having the basic framework for assessing progress a long the fronts that we deem particularly important. I propose formulating a set of Grand Challenges tha t over time become important markers by which we are able to as sess our progress. I take an initial attempt at such a list below, and I hope that over time we refine this list through input fr om all who are interested. The goal is to evolve a clear set of ea sy to state Grand Challenges that serve to attract new researchers as well as provide us a sense of progress and achievement over the lon g range. While such an activity is difficult, and some might say i nappropriate for a young field, as long as we keep this a living, ac tive and changing list, and as long as we are honest in asse ssing progress serve some very useful purposes for the community. In addition, I believe that such a list of Grand Challenges will s erve as a beacon for interested contributors from other communities.
 My initial list of Grand Challenge problems is divi ded into the Pragmatic and the Theoretical. It is my sincere hop e to collect feedback from the community and revise this list ov er time until we reach such stage where a majority of the communi ty believes these problems are worthy and sufficiently represen tative... To keep matters simple for this initial stab at est ablishing grand challenges, I would like to keep the discussion gen eral. Furthermore, while I have many challenges in mind, I will restrict myself to a total of 10 challenges, five within eac h category. 1. How does the data grow? We need a theory for fundamentally understanding what  X  X arge X  or  X  X assiv e X  really means. I first heard this problem from Peter Huber in 1997, and I have yet to see it addressed. Large databases never grow as a result of an independent sampling from a static dis tribution. This IID assumption permeates much of the literature. We inherited it from statistics and engineering. We are in regimes where clearly large databases grow over time from dynamic and cha nging sources. Yet we don X  X  possess the elementary tools for modeling this situation and describing it formally. 2. Complexity/Understandability Tradeoff. We need the mechanisms and techniques for taking complex models that optimize a metric like predictive accuracy, and ren der them understandable. In the reverse direction, we also n eed to be able to start with a simple strategy statement and gener ate a complex model from it. I often say that An Ounce of Knowledge is Worth a Ton of Data. We need to be able to leverage general knowledge o f the problem to form complex and detailed models. 3. Interestingness. Much work has considered measuring when a pattern is interesting, useful, or novel. Yet we still have no theory of how to go about this fundamental notion i n the field. 4. Scalability. Making our algorithms not only work with large volumes of data effectively, but high dimensionalit y, variety of data types (text, images, audio, structured, unstru ctured, etc.) This includes integration with database management syste ms. It also includes defining a framework for graceful degradat ion between high-dimensionality and high fidelity in reduced su bspaces --the equivalent of the SVD (singular value decomposition ) in our field. 5. A Theory for What We Do. What are the fundamental abstractions? What are the basics operations? What are the basic components of an algorithm? What is it that we are optimizing? What is hard? What is doable? Why? What is a  X  X ata summary X ? When are two attributes  X  X imilar X  or  X  X artially sim ilar X ? Can you measure this partial similarity efficiently? Many o ther questions under this heading including Heikki Mannila X  X  favor ite (and I paraphrase): what is an algebra for dealing effecti vely with highly condensed (or summarized) views of large data unive rses? There is a much longer list here, but any advances along the theory for what we do in KDD should be a significant contribut ion. 1. Where is the Data? While we speak much of the data overload, in most situations when one starts a data mining project in an organization or enterprise, data somehow beco mes scarce or inaccessible. We cannot simply wait on corporate cu ltures to change or for people to figure out how to solve the chronic problems in the field of data warehousing. We need to let our algorithms go where the data are, and we need to bu ild our solutions so they contain the necessary data manage ment infra-structure (while leveraging existing tools and syst ems, most notably database technology ad systems). It is impe rative that data mining algorithms not be starved for data, and it i s up to us to solve this  X  X hortage X  rather than wait for it to be solved for us. If we do, I predict a long and fruitless wait. operational systems. The time is now for data mining researchers and practitioners to  X  X et our hands dir ty X . While we all prefer to specialize and focus on what we like, the nature of our field demands a serious degree of immersion and involvement in the surrounding context and operational systems. For an algorithm to truly be interesting, it needs to solv e a real problem and be robust to all the variety and inconsistency that comes with every day life. 3. Integrating Domain Knowledge. We all know that data mining algorithms are  X  X nowledge-free X , meaning the y are brittle and in real applications lak even the very basic  X  X  ommon sense reasoning X  needed to recover even from simple situa tions. We also all know how difficult (some might say impossi ble) is the problem of common sense reasoning. There is a surpr isingly effective means to solve this problem: highly focus ed and deeply integrated solutions. When a data mining algorithm is designed to solve a very specific problem, sufficient knowledge can be embedded within the algorithm and its harness, that it will appear to exhibit deep common sense reasoning ability and it will suddenly become robust to all sort of anomalies. I have yet to see an algorithm in data mining that integrates such do main knowledge. 4. Managing and Maintaining Models. While our community is good at producing new algorithms with every conference, meting, application, or occasion, I see few if any that consider the problem of model maintenance and manag ement. What happens with historical models? How are they r etired? When are they updated? How are the updates performe d so the  X  X orld X  is not changed on the users or the entities being serviced by these models? These are important issues if we e xpect to have real systems that solve real problems with an assoc iated lifecycle and so forth. 5. Effectiveness Measurement. Metrics for measuring quality and fidelity, for measuring success, for measuring return on investment, and so forth. We often consider these a ncillary issues, when often they are the heart of the value. Without measurement there can be no management or understanding. While I said that I would like to start with 10 cha llenges, five technical and five pragmatic, I find myself compell ed to add one more challenge. I shall conclude with this one beca use I think it is extremely important, and I believe it belongs under both categories: Grand Challenge Problem 0: Public Benchmark Data Sets.
 As a field we have failed to define a common data c ollection (corpus) and set benchmark measures relative to it. As a result, it is very difficult to judge both research and system s advances. The establishment of such a collection is not an easy t ask, but is also not impossible. We need a solid mix of both synthet ic (but realistic) and real data sets in this collection. A s a community, we must rise to meet this grand challenge and soon. I would like to conclude this  X  X ongish X  editorial. It is my sincere hope that through debate, feedback, and constructiv e criticism, you will all help me refine this initial proposal t o a healthy and acceptable list of grand challenge problems. Of cou rse, even if we later prove that we were way off in our thinking of what are really grand challenges and what really matters, then that in itself is an advance. All in all, I remain extremely bullish on our field , on its prospects, and on the ability of our growing community to cont ribute significantly to the important research and applica tion problems facing us. Much is hanging in the balance, and I ca n X  X  wait to see the next set of advances in the field. My hope is t o see much of the debate and discussion around this topic appear here in this newsletter. Of course, I also hope that Explorations will chronicle these challenges and the solutions that are advance d to address them. We certainly live in exciting times for our f ield. I look forward to great achievements by this community.
