 Abstract The English-language Princeton WordNet (PWN) and some wordnets for other languages have been extensively used as lexical X  X emantic knowledge sources in language technology applications, due to their free availability and their size. The ubiquitousness of PWN-type wordnets tends to overshadow the fact that they represent one out of many possible choices for structuring a lexical X  X emantic resource, and it could be enlightening to look at a differently structured resource both from the point of view of theoretical X  X ethodological considerations and from the point of view of practical text processing requirements. The resource described here X  X ALDO X  X s such a lexical X  X emantic resource, intended primarily for use in language technology applications, and offering an alternative organization to PWN-style wordnets. We present our work on SALDO, compare it with PWN, and discuss some implications of the differences. We also describe an integrated infrastructure for computational lexical resources where SALDO forms the central component. Keywords Lexical resources Swedish WordNet Interoperability LMF SALDO 1 Introduction 1.1 An alternative to WordNet The English-language Princeton WordNet (PWN; see Fellbaum 1998b ) and corresponding lexical resources for other languages have enjoyed great success in many areas of language technology.

At least in part, this is arguably due to the  X  X treetlight effect X . PWN and some other wordnets are large enough to be used for processing of unrestricted text and other real-world language technology applications, and they are available under various open-content licenses. A safe guess would be that the openness is the crucial factor here; even large wordnets with more restrictive licenses X  X .g. the ones that were built in the EuroWordNet project (Vossen 1998 ) X  X end to have few users outside their original circle of compilers. It is certainly also a factor in this equation that PWN is a resource for English, the lingua franca and target language par pr X f X rence of the international language technology community.

The ubiquitousness of PWN-type lexical resources tends to overshadow the fact that PWN represents one out of many possible choices X  X nd possibly not the optimal choice X  X or structuring a lexical X  X emantic resource, and it could be enlightening to look at a differently structured resource both from the point of view of theoretical X  X ethodological considerations and from the point of view of practical text processing requirements.

The resource described here X  X ALDO X  X s such a lexical X  X emantic resource, structured according to quite different principles from PWN. In the next section, we briefly describe the history of SALDO, and in the rest of this paper, we will discuss some of the salient characteristics of SALDO, and when appropriate, contrast these with PWN-style lexical resources. Specifically, the following will be highlighted: (1) The main lexical X  X emantic relation of SALDO is the  X  X  X on-classical X  X  (2) SALDO covers all parts of speech, not only open classes (Sects. 3 and 5 ); (3) it reflects a principled approach to the description of multi-word-expressions (4) as well as a principled approach to content-model standardization with an
The work on SALDO has gone hand in hand with the establishment of a general web-service based infrastructure for working with language resources in our research unit. This infrastructure is described in Sect. 7 Finally, we discuss some still-open issues and plans for the future development of SALDO in Sect. 8 and summarize and conclude in Sect. 9
However, in order to set the background for the description of SALDO, we first need to give a brief description of the relevant characteristics of PWN-style wordnets. 1.2 Some characteristics of PWN and other wordnets In building its widely-used lexical resource, the PWN group chose particular versions of  X  X  X lassical X  X  semantic relations as the backbone of this lexical network. 1
A specific construal of synonymy is used to form one of the basic units of PWN, the synset . The synsets X  X epresenting (lexicalized) concepts X  X re in their turn organized into networks by relations such as hyponymy (and its converse hyperonymy 2 or superordinate), a classical taxonomical relation. PWN and other wordnets also recognize some relations directly among words, e.g., derivational morphological relations. The other X  X rguably even more basic X  X nit is the word (sense) ; more than half the synsets in PWN are singleton sets X  X ave only one member X  X hich of course cannot have been determined by synonymy. The vast majority of these are naturally explained by also being the only synset for their single member lemma. However, in many cases (over 18,000 in PWN 3.0), singleton synsets represent senses of lemmas which also appear in other synsets. Interestingly, a fair number of these lemmas (almost 3,000) appear in exactly 2 singleton synsets, i.e., these lemmas have two senses neither of which has been determined by mutual substitutability with some other lemma(s) in a specific sentential context. This is hard to reconcile with the statement that the synset is the foundational unit of PWN. The interesting theoretical question arising from this is whether it will ever be possible to have a wordnet X  X or any language X  X here all word senses recognized for the language will appear only in non-singleton synsets.
Also, it would probably surprise some more traditionally oriented linguists to learn that purely linguistic-form determined factors play such a large role in PWN. For example,  X  X  X n effort has been made to avoid cases where a noun is its own hyponym X  X  (Miller 1998 , 27f), which in effect prohibits the inclusion of cases of hyponymy under polysemy or homonymy. Also, in PWN, a synset cannot cross POS boundaries. In older linguistic works and especially talking about languages with richer morphological systems, it is often taken for granted that, e.g., a verb and the corresponding deverbal action noun express the same concept, have the same core sense. On this view, the difference between to sing (v.) and the singing (n.) is no more significant than the tense difference between sings and sang for the lexical/ core meaning of the words. Both express the concept of singing, but in forms determined by the syntactic frame in which they are made to function (see, e.g., Fellbaum 2005 ). The differences are in both cases purely formal, not conceptual. We would expect this to hold a fortiori for PWN, where grammatical/functional concepts are banned from the lexical resource; PWN holds only items from the four open classes nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, although, e.g., numerals X  separate parts of speech in many grammatical traditions X  X re in fact present in PWN as nouns (cardinals) and adjectives (ordinals), apparently following a tradition in English lexicography (Apresjan 2002 , 94). 2 The origin of SALDO Svenskt associationslexikon (SAL; see Lo  X  nngren 1992 ) X  X  X he Swedish Associative Thesaurus X  X  X hich formed the basis for SALDO, is a relatively little known Swedish thesaurus with an unusual semantic organization (described in Sect. 3 below).
SAL was created during the years 1987 X 1992 by Lennart Lo  X  nngren and his co-workers 3 in the Center for Computational Linguistics at Uppsala University. SAL has been published in paper form in two reports, from the Center for Computational Linguistics (Lo  X  nngren 1989 ), and the Department of Linguistics (Lo  X  nngren 1992 ), both at Uppsala University. Additionally, the headwords and their basic semantic characterizations have been available electronically, in the form of text files, from the very beginning.

The ideas underlying SAL and its history have been documented by Lo  X  nngren ( 1988 , 1989 , 1998 ) and Borin ( 2005 ). Initially, text corpora were used as sources of the vocabulary which went into SAL, e.g., a Swedish textbook for foreigners and a corpus of popular-scientific articles. A small encyclopedia and some other sources provided the large number (over 3,000) of proper nouns found in SAL. Eventually, a list of the headwords from a large Swedish reference dictionary was acquired from the Natural Language Processing and Lexicology Unit at the University of Gothenburg, and the second paper edition of SAL (Lo  X  nngren 1992 ) contained 71,750 entries. The work described here first started in late 2003, when Lars Borin and Lennart Lo  X  nngren initiated a collaboration aiming at making SAL available for online browsing through Spra  X  kbanken (the Swedish Language Bank at the University of Gothenburg).

We soon realized, however, that in order to be practically useful in language technology applications, SAL would have to be provided at least with inflectional morphological information. Thus Markus Forsberg joined the group and the work on SALDO began. SALDO consequently has a lexical X  X emantic component inherited from SAL X  X escribed in the next section X  X nd a morphological compo-nent providing information about part of speech, inflectional and compounding behavior, and some other information about entries, which comprise both single orthographic words and multi-word expressions. Morphological processing X  inflectional analysis, inflectional full-form generation and compound analysis X  X s handled by a dedicated morphology component (see Sect. 5 ). At the time of writing, SALDO contains some 126,000 entries, and it is growing continuously. 4 3 The semantic structure of SALDO As a semantic lexicon, SALDO is a kind of lexical X  X emantic network, superficially similar to PWN, but quite different from it in the principles by which it is structured. SALDO is about the same age as PWN, and it was developed completely independently of the latter, inspired more by a Russian tradition of lexical description, rather than an Anglo-Saxon one; cf., for example, Igor X  Mel X  X   X  uk X  X  Meaning X  X ext Model (Mel X  X   X  uk 1974 ).

If the fundamental organizing principle of PWN is the idea of full synonyms in a taxonomic concept hierarchy, the basic linguistic idea underlying SALDO is instead that, semantically speaking, the whole vocabulary of a language can be described as having a center X  X r core X  X nd (consequently) a periphery. The notion of core vocabulary is familiar from several linguistic subdisciplines (Borin 2012 ). In SALDO this idea is consistently applied down to the level of individual word senses, as we will now describe.
 The basic lexical X  X emantic organizational principle of SALDO is hierarchical. Every entry in SALDO X  X epresenting a word sense X  X s supplied with one or more semantic descriptors, which are themselves also entries in the dictionary. All entries in SALDO (with the exception of the top node PRIM; see below) are actually occurring words or conventionalized or lexicalized multi-word units of the language. No attempt is made to fill perceived gaps in the lexical network using definition-like paraphrases, as is sometimes done in PWN (Fellbaum 1998a , 5f). One of the descriptors, called primary , is obligatory. The primary descriptor is the entry which better than any other entry fulfills two requirements: (1) it is a semantic neighbor of the entry to be desribed and (2) it is more central than it. Both these aspects need some clarification.
That two words are semantic neighbors means that there is a direct semantic relationship between them (such as synonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, argument X  predicate relationship and so on). Here we are immediately faced with one problem: What about semantically empty words, how can we determine their neighbors? SALDO includes not only open-class words, but also pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions etc., which are often considered to have syntactic function, rather than semantic content. This is, however, a simplification. It is true that some of these words, such as of, for, that ,are extremely empty, but so are, for instance, support verbs like exert (and the noun exertion ), undergo , etc. In a phrase like exert influence the verb has a purely  X  X  X yntactic X  X , i.e., connective, function. In such cases closeness must be determined with respect to function or syntagmatic connections, rather than (semantic) content. Fortunately, the majority of entries have semantic content, so we will continue to talk here about semantic closeness. Admittedly, in SALDO we have so far mostly based the analysis of a word on its use in a semantic context. The separation of  X  X elexicalized X  entries (cf. believe in as opposed to in the basket ) is a task for the future.

Centrality is determined by means of several criteria, the most important being frequency: a word with high frequency is more central than a word with low frequency. Although the compilers of SALDO rarely refer to explicit frequency data in making their decisions about primary descriptors, but rather rely on their lexicographical experience and linguistic intuition in making this judgement, in fact it turns out a posteriori that slightly over 90 % of SALDO entries have primary descriptors that are at least as frequent as the entries themselves in a large (1,200 MW) corpus of written Swedish. 5
A second criterion is stylistic value: a stylistically neutral word is more central than one that is stylistically marked. The first two criteria could be applied to any pair of word senses. A third criterion is based on word formation: of two derivationally related words the one with lower complexity is more central than the one with higher complexity. Then there are certain semantic relationships that themselves are asymmetric in such a way that one member must be considered superordinate. Thus a hyperonym is generally more central than a hyponym, a word signifying  X  X art X  is less central than the word signifying the corresponding whole object.

Given that only one primary descriptor can be assigned, the compilers of SALDO will sometimes need to choose among several candidates which fulfill some, but not all, criteria. In such cases, the emergent topology of the whole lexical X  X emantic network becomes crucial (see below).

The primary descriptor will in practice quite often be either a hyperonym or synonym of the keyword. An entry in SALDO may in addition have one or more secondary descriptors . 6 A secondary descriptor is an entry which, once the primary descriptor is chosen, helps to specify the sense of the keyword.

The requirement that SALDO form a hierarchy means that there must be at least one sense at the top which of course itself cannot have another word sense as primary descriptor. In fact, it turns out that there is a small number of senses for which so far no suitable primary descriptor has been found. In order to make SALDO into a single hierarchy, an artificial entry, called PRIM, is used as the primary descriptor of 43 semantically unrelated entries at the top of the hierarchy, making all of SALDO into a single rooted tree. These  X  X emantic primitives X  of SALDO are shown in Fig. 1 .

Below, we give a few examples of entries with their primary and secondary descriptor senses, randomly selected under the letter  X  X  X  X  X  in SALDO:
We have often characterized SALDO as an  X  X  X ssociative thesaurus X  X , but in this connection it is important to note that the intended associations are lexical X  X emantic ones, and by no means the free word associations elicited in a psychological or psycholinguistic test. The only valid criteria for appointing a primary descriptor to an entry are maximal semantic closeness to the entry and higher centrality than the information that is not to be considered part of the word senses themselves. In order to embrace the whole lexicon we had to abstain from using more traditional intrinsically specified lexical-semantic relations, such as the hyperonymy relation making up the backbone of PWN, which can be directly read off from a semantic specification of an entry, e.g., a definition. The latter relations do not serve as guidelines for the selection, but often emerge as results in the process. The centrality is based on several criteria which sometimes can contradict each other, but which on the whole harmonize. If they did not, it would be impossible to carry out the analysis on a large scale.

For each entry the primary descriptor is selected manually, according to the mixed relationship mentioned above. Is this an objective method? Yes, we believe so. This method corresponds to that used in traditional lexicographic work, which generally proceeds on an entry-by-entry basis. In this case, as in the case of SALDO, systematicity and objectivity are achieved by having a clear set of principles and highly qualified people to do the work. The objectivity is further ensured by thorough subsequent examination of the resulting network configuration surround-ing each entry. The constant revision of previous analyses is extremely important. The structure emerges from numerous local decisions: it is disclosed, rather than created.
 As was mentioned above, the prevailing relations are synonymy and hyponymy. Synonymy, being non-directional, requires additional criteria to ensure that the entry is less central than its primary descriptor, for example frequency, stylistic value, and morphological complexity. Examples are kille  X  X uy X  X  pojke  X  X oy X ; sannolikhet  X  X robability X  X  sannolik  X  X robable X ; liv  X  X ife X  X  leva  X  X ive (v) X . 7
Hyponymy is a directional relation, the hyperonym being, in principle, more central than the hyponym, for example blomma  X  X lower X  X  v X xt  X  X lant X . In compounds, so productive in Swedish, the second part is, as a rule, superordinate in relation to the whole word, and can often serve as primary descriptor. The first part of the compound then is typically used as secondary descriptor, for example stenhus  X  X tone house X  X  hus  X  X ouse X  ? sten  X  X tone X .

It turns out that in many cases neither a synonym nor a hyperonym can be used as a descriptor. Possible candidates may be less central than the keyword. For example, for h X st  X  X orse X  the zoologically correct taxonomical hyperonym hovdjur  X  X oofed animal X  must be rejected. There may also exist a more central, but too  X  X emote X , hyperonym, for example person  X  X erson X  in words like er X vrare  X  X onqueror X . Similarly, in many cases del  X  X art X  is rejected as primary descriptor.

In the absence of a suitable synonym or hyperonym other relations correspond to the primary descriptor. For example, in the example given above, balkong  X  X alcony X  X  hus  X  X ouse X  we observe meronymy, a directional relation. The primary descriptor may be a predicate, for which the entry would be a prototypical argument, for example damm  X  X ust X  X  torr  X  X ry X ; streck  X  X ine X  X  rita  X  X raw X . Especially commonly occurring arguments are agents and instruments, for example vinnare  X  X inner X  X  vinna  X  X in X ; astronom  X  X stronomer X  X  astronomi  X  X stronomy X ; kniv  X  X nife X  X  sk X ra  X  X ut X .

If a synonym is used as the primary descriptor, there is no need for a secondary descriptor. If a hyperonym is used, one or more secondary descriptors are often added, with a specifying function. Beyond this, there are no particular semantic requirements on a secondary descriptor. It can be a holonym or a predicate, for example bordskant  X  X able edge X  X  kant  X  X dge X  ? bord  X  X able X ; s X g  X  X aw (n) X  X  verktyg  X  X ool X  ? s X ga  X  X aw (v) X . But also other semantic relations are possible here, for example material, as we saw in stenhus  X  X tone house X .

In many cases the predicate X  X rgument relation holds between two descriptors, for example glasbl X sning  X  X lass-blowing X  X  bl X sning  X  X lowing X  ? glas  X  X lass X ; snabb-seglande  X  X ast-sailing X  X  segla  X  X ail X  ? snabb  X  X ast X . Certain words are very frequently used as modifying secondary descriptors, for example: inte  X  X ot X , utan  X  X ithout X , (o)m X jlig  X (im)possible X , hon  X  X he X , motsats  X  X pposite (n) X , mycket  X  X ery X , alltf X r  X  X oo X , igen  X  X gain X , mot  X  X gainst X , v X l  X  X ell X , nyss  X  X ecently X , l X tt  X  X asy X . Here belong also the two-place predicates likna  X  X e similar X  and som  X  X ike, as X .

Originally, we allowed only one secondary descriptor. There was no particular theoretical motivation for this restriction, and we now permit an arbitrary number of secondary descriptors. This was directly prompted by the need to account for multi-part compounds like femrumsl X genhet  X  X ive-room apartment X  (and derivations like femrummare , lit.  X  X ive-roomer X ), which now has three descriptors: l X genhet  X  X part-ment X  ? rum  X  X oom X  ? fem  X  X ive X . Once this possibility was available, assigning more than one secondary descriptor has turned out to be well motivated also for other kinds of words.

SALDO is being updated X  X orrected and enlarged X  X n a daily basis. This work requires a well functioning search and browsing interface, which has now been created, after several attempts and considerable effort (see Sect. 7 ) When entering a word into the search box the system delivers one or several  X  X resentation lines X , showing all possible senses in which the given string is represented. From there it is possible to proceed to the semantic table of each sense and find all other immediately connected X  X uperordinate as well as subordinate X  X enses in the network. It is also possible to have a look at the morphological properties and occurrences of the word in text corpora.

As was already pointed out, each distinguished sense of a word constitutes a separate entry in SALDO. Distinguishing such senses is a difficult task, which is solved in different ways by traditional lexicographers and in different lexicograph-ical traditions. In SALDO to single out an autonomous sense means accepting this distinction pervasively; for instance, wherever the word occurs in a compound it must be assigned the correct sense index. The distinction, once made, can never be neutralized. It should come as no surprise, then, that the  X  X ense granularity X  of SALDO is much coarser than that of PWN. SALDO has on the average 1.1 senses per entry base form, and the most polysemous entry has 10 senses. Slightly more than 7 % of all base forms are polysemous. In PWN the most polysemous entry is the verb break with 59 senses. About 17 % of all base form X  X OS combinations are polysemous. Both lexicons display the same kind of X  X istinctly Zipfian X  X istribu-tion of senses over headwords (Borin 2010 ).

The difference is partly because of lexicographic tradition, partly because of the way sense distinctions must be propagated through the SALDO hierarchy, and partly due to the special construal of synonymy determining the structure of PWN. Word sense distinctions can be made arbitrarily fine-grained (Murphy 2003 ), among other things depending on how much the understanding of words in context is believed to rely on the same general principles of interpretation and inference which can also be invoked to account for novel word usages, such as creative metaphor (Cruse 2000 ). However, there seems to be a (fuzzy) limit beyond which the processing perspective (Kilgarriff 1997 ; Hanks 2000 ; Erk 2010 ).

That two senses of a word have been identified means that they are supplied with different descriptors. Sometimes they differ only in the secondary part of the description, which in a way corresponds to polysemy, rather than homonymy. As to words situated very close to the center, for which it is difficult or impossible to find descriptors, we allow separation without changing the description part. In such cases subordinate entries must fall into clearly distinguishable semantic groups.
SALDO is built completely bottom-up, by means of a large number of local decisions. No global plan is imposed. There are no metalinguistic categories or features. Every sense is given a description, and is also itself a potential descriptor. Of course, a great part of the senses have not X  X et X  X een used as descriptors. At present, two thirds of the word senses in SALDO are leaf nodes in the tree. 8
By logical necessity, every sense in SALDO has a certain depth, by which we mean distance from the top node PRIM in terms of a chain of successive primary descriptors. For instance, starting from hoplit  X  X oplite X , which has the depth 11, we arrive at PRIM through the following steps: infanterist  X  X nfantry soldier X , infanteri  X  X nfantry X , trupp  X  X roop X , milit X r  X  X ilitary X , krig  X  X ar X , k X mpa  X  X ight X , sl X   X  X eat X , mot  X  X gainst X , med  X  X ith (comitative) X , ha  X  X ave X . The depth illustrated is close to the maximum; the average (as well as the median) depth in SALDO is only 6. Interestingly, comparing SALDO X  X  topmost word senses X  X he children of PRIM X  X ith the  X  X  X emantic primes X  X  of Wierzbicka and Goddard X  X  Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) (Wierzbicka 1996 ; Goddard 2008 ), we may note that the Swedish counterparts of the NSM primes (Goddard and Karlsson 2008 ) are generally found close to the top node in SALDO. 9 This again indicates that the numerous local decisions by which SALDO X  X  lexical-semantic hierarchy emerges are, on the whole, sound. 4 A comparison of SALDO and PWN SALDO and PWN are similar in many respects: (1) Both are manually constructed large general lexical resources. 10 (2) In both cases their construction was initially motivated by linguistic research (3) Both are primarily lexical X  X emantic resources, but for practical reasons, both (4) Both are built on top of a traditional set of word senses as construed in their (5) Both are based on relational semantics, although SALDO perhaps more so (1) SALDO has only one kind of basic lexical unit, the word sense, whereas PWN (2) The fundamental lexical-semantic relation in SALDO is partly extrinsically (3) The granularity of word-sense distinctions is considerably coarser in SALDO (4) PWN includes definitions and often examples for most of its synsets. SALDO (5) SALDO aspires to include the full lexicon of Swedish X  X pen and closed parts By way of concrete illustration, let us look at two word sense descriptions in SALDO and their counterparts in PWN.

The Swedish word kant means  X  X dge (n) X . SALDO gives one sense for this word, corresponding to the following three PWN noun synsets: edge, border (the boundary of a surface) ( hyperonym: boundary, bound, bounds (the line or plane indicating the limit or extent of something) ; 15 co-hyponyms, denoting various kinds of boundaries) edge (a sharp side formed by the intersection of two surfaces of an object)  X  X  X e rounded the edges of the box X  X  ( hyperonym: side (an extended outer surface of an object) ; 12 co-hyponyms, denoting various surfaces) edge (the outside limit of an object or area or surface; a place farthest away from the center of something)  X  X  X he edge of the leaf is wavy X  X ;  X  X  X he sat on the edge of the bed X  X ;  X  X  X he water X  X  edge X  X  ( hyperonym: limit, demarcation, demarcation line (the boundary of a specific area) ; 4 co-hyponyms, denoting various demarcation lines)
In order to make a concrete comparison of SALDO and PWN as lexical-semantic networks, it is useful to consider that the two fundamental parts of the description in SALDO, primary and secondary descriptor, can form the basis of any number of derived relations, defining sets of word senses. 15 In particular, the set formed by a word sense together with its primary descriptor and all its siblings under the same primary descriptor (referred to as  X  X  X -siblings X  X  below) has turned out to be very useful in the day-to-day work with SALDO, as a good indicator of the soundness of descriptor assignments. We expect such sets to correspond to natural semantic groupings. This set for the word kant looks as follows: primary descriptor vid  X  X y, beside (prep) X  p-siblings ang X   X  X oncern (v) X ; bredvid  X  X ext to (prep) X ; hos  X  X y, with (prep) X ; h X rvid  X  X n connection with this (adv) X ; i anslutning till  X  X n connection to (prep) X ; invid  X  X ext to (prep) X ; kant  X  X dge (n) X ; n X ra  X  X lose (adv) X ; r X ra 2  X  X ouch (v) X ; vid 3  X  X y, beside (adv) X ; vid sidan av  X  X eside (prep); omkring  X  X round (prep) X 
This example serves to illustrate how all parts of speech are integrated in the lexical-semantic descriptions of SALDO: the set contains prepositions, adverbs, verbs and one noun ( kant itself). The possibility of linking words of different parts of speech is very limited in PWN, and it is only used with any systematicity to link derivationally related items. In this case we find links to verbs like edge , border and X  X ia a word link to a synset member X  surround . Some of the corresponding Swedish words can be found by descending the SALDO hierarchy from the items shown above, e.g., the verb kanta  X  X dge (v) X  has kant  X  X dge (n) X  as its primary descriptor.

In SALDO the frequent use of typical arguments or typical predicates as descriptors ensures that words with different parts of speech are linked on the basis of situation or frame-like semantic connections. Our second SALDO example is intended to illustrate this. The Swedish noun stege has two senses in SALDO. Here we will be concerned with stege 1  X  X adder (n) X  and not stege 2  X  X traight (poker hand) (n) X : primary descriptor kl X ttra  X  X limb (v) X  p-siblings kl X ttrande  X  X limbing (n); kl X ttrare  X  X limber (n) X ; kl X ttring  X  X limb(ing) (n) X ; bestiga  X  X limb, ascend (mountain) (v) X ;  X ntra  X  X oard (ship) (v) X ; okl X ttrad  X  X nclimbed (a) X ; kl X ttra ner  X  X limb down (v) X ; takkl X ttrare  X  X oof climber (n) X 
This word sense corresponds to two PWN (singleton) noun synsets: ladder (steps consisting of two parallel members connected by rungs; for climbing up or down) ( hyperonym: stairs, steps (a flight of stairs or a flight of steps) ; no co-hyponyms) ladder (ascending stages by which somebody or something can progress)  X  X  X e climbed the career ladder X  X  ( hyperonym: degree, level, stage, point (a specific identifiable position in a continuum or series or especially in a process) ; 9 co-hyponyms, denoting stages of various kinds)
Neither of the two PWN synsets is directly connected to a corresponding verb (or words of any other part of speech). The PWN definitions and examples do contain relevant predicates ( X  X  X limbing X  X ,  X  X  X rogress X  X ,  X  X  X scending X  X ,  X  X  X p X  X ,  X  X  X own X  X ), but they do not have a formalized role in the lexical X  X emantic network. However, the co-hyponyms are in many cases linked to verbs and adjectives, but only to derivationally related words, such as elevate (v) , extend (v) or climactic (a) . These two examples highlight some of the differences between SALDO and PWN that have been mentioned already. SALDO contains words of all parts of speech, and its lexical X  X emantic links often connects words of different parts of speech. PWN has more fine-grained sense distinctions than SALDO, so that one SALDO sense often corresponds to several PWN synsets. The lexical X  X emantic network of PWN is still very much determined by its  X  X ore X  relations, whereas the picture we get, e.g., from the second SALDO example reminds us about something we might get if we asked a person to enumerate words that they associate with the word ladder , and it is reminiscent of the  X  X  X on-classical X  X  lexical X  X emantic relations discussed by Morris and Hirst ( 2004 ). 16 5 Morphological information in SALDO The original SAL did not contain any formal information about entries, not even an indication of part of speech. Thus, one important difference between SALDO and SAL is that SALDO now has full information about the part of speech and inflectional pattern of each entry.

PWN comes with an inflectional morphological component. This is rarely mentioned in the literature, partly because the most interesting aspect of PWN is its semantic organization, but partly probably also because English inflectional morphology is so simple (a maximum of 4 noun forms, 4 verb forms, 3 adjective forms, no declensions or conjugations, in a system that is basically agglutinating, plus a small number of irregular items). If we want to offer a full lexical component for language technology applications, inflectional morphology must also be addressed. Swedish inflection X  X lthough still fairly simple from a global perspec-tive X  X s an order of magnitude more complex than that of English. There are more forms in the paradigm for all the open parts of speech. In addition, there are 7 noun declensions, 2 adjective declensions, and 3 verb conjugations X  X ll with further subdivisions X  X lus a number of irregular items.
 The morphological component of SALDO has been implemented using Functional Morphology (FM; see Forsberg 2007 ; Borin et al. 2008 ). The size of SALDO X  X  morphology is 1.8M word forms compiled from 115k morphological specifications, i.e., an average of 16 word forms per specification.

At present there are more than one thousand different inflectional patterns represented in the lexicon. Among these are many singleton patterns. In many cases, these are the irregular words of traditional grammar. Surprisingly often, however, the source of plenty is another, viz. variation. We often find that a particular combination of morphosyntactic features X  X  particular position in a paradigm X  X or a word or small group of words can be filled by more than one form, i.e. realized in more than one way. Such cases are legion.

There is an interesting theoretical issue lurking here. For Wurzel ( 1989 , 57) an inflectional class (which he uses as a technical term) must have more than one or even just a few members, although he is not prepared to commit himself to a specific lower limit. A practically useful computational lexicon should in any case specify the morphological behavior of individual words as accurately as possible. In SALDO, this behavior is encoded uniformly for all words, in the form of a unique identifier for each inflectional pattern. In other words, in the lexicon we do not make a distinction between inflectional classes and individual cases in Wurzel X  X  sense. This task is relegated to the computational morphological component, where a mapping is made between SALDO X  X  inflectional patterns and regular, subregular and idiosyncratic inflectional descriptions. However, it is not difficult to get a picture of which inflectional patterns are general and which idiosyncratic. As with many other linguistic phenomena, a small number of patterns account for the majority of entries. There are 25 inflectional patterns with more than 1,000 members in SALDO, which together account for 75 % of all entries. 6 Non-traditional entries in SALDO SALDO, continuing the principles of SAL, is not restricted X  X n the way traditional dictionaries usually are X  X o common nouns and one-word entries. Like in PWN, proper nouns and multi-word expressions make up a considerable, but wholly integrated, part of our lexical resource. Such entries are analysed in the same way as other words. The intricacies of giving a serious lexical X  X emantic and morphological account of proper nouns in a lexical resource such as SALDO will not be discussed here. Instead we turn to a discussion of how we deal with multi-word expressions.
Already the original SAL contained some 2,000 multi-word expressions (MWEs), and SALDO at present has about 6,000 MWEs, making up around 5 % of the entries. However, out of new entries being added to SALDO, the share of MWEs is growing steadily. We feel that any serious large-scale lexical resource must have a principled and practical way of dealing with MWEs, even if some lexicographers and linguists feel that they are  X  X  X he  X  X lack hole X  of semantics X  X  (Baranov and Dobrovol X  X kij 2008 , 567), i.e., a vast and largely uncharted territory into which we must venture without much guidance from linguistic and lexicographical practice.
 Consequently, a good deal of thought has gone into accomodating MWEs in SALDO in a way that is both practical and linguistically satisfactory. At the moment, we distinguish three different kinds of MWEs: (1) Continuous MWEs ; these correspond to the  X  X  X ixed expressions X  X  and  X  X  X emi-(2) Discontinuous MWEs ; these are, by and large, the  X  X  X yntactically-flexible (3) Constructions ; these are X  X ery loosely characterized, and with a view to
These types are practical to distinguish for (written) Swedish, and no particular claim is made here as to their universality. 17 The first two kinds are fully integrated in the SALDO morphology, both descriptively and w.r.t. morphological processing. Constructions still remain (high) on our to-do list, however.

For the first two kinds of MWEs, we simply assume  X  X  X ord-like X  X  or lexical(ized) semantics. The trivial observation that a single orthographic word in one language often corresponds to a conventionalized MWE in some other language, supports this assumption. The fact that such MWEs sometimes have compositional, non-MWE readings in addition to the conventionalized/lexicalized one is in principle no more of a problem than when a lexicalized compound also has a compositional reading in a language like German or Swedish. Cf. Swedish husbil  X  X amper, trailer X , but also compositionally  X  X ouse car X . How common is an alternative compositional reading of an MWE? We don X  X  know. In fact, we don X  X  know this about compounds either (at least we are not aware of any linguistic studies investigating this), only that the compositional reading is always possible if all members are also living words in the language. The facts that a compositional reading of a conventionalized compound normally has to be forced, and is often used for humorous effect, indicate that this is not the normal state of affairs. 7 A modular, interoperable language resource infrastructure For some years, we have had an infrastructure in place for publishing daily updates of SALDO on the web. The updates include not only an updated search interface and downloadable resources, but also an extensive set of web services 18 and set of HTML files with information about statistics, history, and formal errors. 19
This infrastructure is now being extended into a generic infrastructure for all our lexical resources, referred to as Karp (Borin et al. 2012 ). The name Karp is used both to denote the search interface 20 and the whole infrastructure. Figure 2 shows a subset of the hits when searching for lexikon (noun)  X  X exicon X  in the graphical user interface of Karp. The sentence under the search field is a random instance containing lexikon (noun) retrieved from our corpus infrastructure (Borin et al. 2012 ). The search generates twelve hits in eight out of the twenty-one lexical resources, of which five are shown from the resources SALDO, Swesaurus, the beginnings of a Swedish wordnet, and the Swedish Framenet. Clicking on the  X  X  X ownload resource X  X  link on the top right moves us to the resource download page.

The extension of the lexical infrastructure rests on two design features of the resources: (1) a standardized data model ; and X  X ore importantly X (2) a standardized content model .
 The data model is based on the Lexical Markup Framework (LMF; see ISO 2008 ; Francopoulo 2013 ), and it is accompanied by facilities for converting it automat-ically into a number of other formats.
 Standardization of the content model has been an important goal in our work on SALDO from the very beginning. Early on we designed a content model for SALDO with the explicit aim of making SALDO the pivot resource in a growing collection of lexical data originating from various lexical and digitization projects (Borin et al. 2010 ).

For this reason, any entities to be manipulated in the infrastructure should have unique persistent identifiers (PIDs). In SALDO, there are PIDs for word senses, lemgrams, 21 parts of speech, paradigms, and lexical X  X emantic relations. The most important ones in the larger scale of things are the word sense identifiers, which form the links between SALDO and other resources, and by extension, links among all the other resources through SALDO. 22 For pragmatic reasons, the identifiers were designed to be human-readable valid XML names. A difference in SALDO sense identifiers conveys only that there is a word sense difference, but says nothing about its character or magnitude; this information must be provided separately, e.g. as a lexical-semantic relation, possibly accompanied by a number (e.g.,  X  X  X  and B have a degree of synonymy of 0.8 X  X  23 ).

Since SALDO is the pivot among our lexical resources, work on the other resources takes SALDO X  X  sense and lemgram sets as their point of departure. This is not supposed to be a straitjacket, however. Often, this work reveals the need for new lexical units, which are added to SALDO X  X ossibly after some discussion among the team members X  X nd from there in turn propagated to the other resources. 8 Outstanding issues and future plans There is ample evidence in the literature for the usefulness of PWN in various practical text processing tasks dealing with word semantics, and also much discussion of its shortcomings (e.g., Morris and Hirst 2004 ; Erk 2010 ), but what about SALDO? In our project so far, the main focus has been on making a full-scale lexical resource for Swedish language technology, and on building the general infrastructure described in the previous section, in part to support the development of SALDO and other lexical resources. The use of SALDO in practical applications is only quite recent. Consequently, we have only some tentative findings to report. SALDO is used in the annotation process of our text corpora, about 1.2 GW of Swedish text accessible online in a dedicated corpus search interface. 24 In addition to the morphological analysis and introduction of the identifiers of SALDO, it provides a (semantically)  X  X  X elated words X  X  feature in the corpus search interface (Fig. 3 ).

In the project Consumption patterns and life-style in Swedish literature ,a collaboration with historians at our university and with the literature digitization initiative Litteraturbanken (the Swedish Literature Bank), we have worked on a semantic search prototype using SALDO and lexical resources for nineteenth century Swedish linked to SALDO. The tool was used by historians conducting searches for semantically related words in a large database of 19th century Swedish literature, but it has not been formally evaluated (Borin et al. 2011 ).

As mentioned in Sect. 6 , we are discussing how to best describe certain constructions in SALDO. The issues in connection with this range from the fairly trivial question of how to design the  X  X ord sense X  identifiers for constructions, to the problem of incorporating constructions in the morphological analysis component in a reasonable way. This work is perhaps best seen as an aspect of the Swedish FrameNet ?? project currently pursued in our group (Borin et al. 2010 ).

The lexical-semantic information in SALDO is not an alternative to that found in a wordnet, but should be seen as a complement. Ideally, we would like both kinds of information for all lexical entries. However, at present, there is no generally available full-size wordnet for Swedish. We have started the work of adding PWN-like relations such as synonymy, hyponymy, and antonymy to SALDO, and we are also attempting to link at least part of SALDO to PWN (see below). In addition, we are including the content of Synlex (Kann and Rosell 2006 ), also referred to as  X  X  X he people X  X  synonym lexicon X  X , an interesting free semantic resource, which has been created by asking voluntary users of an English X  X wedish dictionary lookup service on the internet to judge the degree of synonymy between word pairs on a scale from 0 to 5. With Synlex entries connected to SALDO senses (since Synlex provides only headwords), we could use the synonymy degree information at arbitrary cut-off points to create virtual  X  X  X uzzy wordnets X  X  for Swedish. This would partly address an oft-heard criticism of the PWN concept, invoking a postulated universal linguistic principle of synonymy avoidance (Carstairs-McCarthy 1999 ; Murphy 2003 ). With the kind of degree-of-synonymy information present in Synlex X  X nly about 5 % of the word pairs in Synlex have the highest degree of synonymy, 5.0 X  X e could create a PWN-like lexical resource where we could exactly quantify the  X  X ear-synonymy X  that is sometimes said to define PWN synsets. The resulting resource will allow us to experiment with and evaluate different kinds of lexical-semantic information as the basis for practical text processing applications. The work on this resource X  Swesaurus  X  X s ongoing (Borin and Forsberg 2011 ), and as with our other lexical resources, the work can be followed on the web. 25
The connection of SALDO to other lexical resources is today accomplished using identity as the only possible relationship. As long as we stay with modern Swedish, this is a reasonable decision. Internally, lexical resources come with all kinds of lexical-semantic relationships, including of course the ones presented above in Sect. 2 for SALDO itself. As mentioned in the previous section, the successive incorporation of more and diverse resources inevitably leads to revisions of all the resources, but at the same time to their mutual enrichment.

However, as we are beginning to include resources from different historical stages of Swedish, there is a clear need for a more varied array of inter-lexical relationships, since we know that there are word senses in, e.g., medieval Swedish which do not exist in the modern language and which we consequently would not like to include as such in SALDO. This becomes even more necessary if we wish to link SALDO to another language, e.g., to PWN. The question is which relationships to use. SKOS 26 may offer a good, standardized, general and fairly theory-neutral set, but this remains to be determined. In many cases, there will be no other possible relationship than a kind of paraphrasing translation between lexical items belonging two language stages or two different languages. 9 Conclusion SALDO is a full-sized lexical resource for Swedish, featuring a complete computational morphological description including a 1.8 MW full-form lexicon, as well as a lexical-semantic network offering an alternative organization to PWN-style wordnets. It has proved useful in some pilot applications, e.g., semantic search in historical texts, but its value as a lexical X  X emantic resource for language technology remains to be more thoroughly evaluated. It is freely available under an open-content license (Creative Commons BY 3.0) and can also be used through an array of web services, and we invite all interested to experiment with SALDO in text processing and other language technology applications for Swedish. 27 References
