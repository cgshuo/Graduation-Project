 In this paper, we propose a probabilistic survival model de-rived from the survival analysis theory for measuring as-pect novelty. The retrieved documents X  query-relevance and novelty are combined at the aspect level for re-ranking. Ex-periments conducted on the TREC 2006 and 2007 Genomics collections demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ap-proach in promoting ranking diversity for biomedical infor-mation retrieval.

In the biomedical domain, the desired information of a question (query) asked by biologists usually is a list of a certain type of entities covering different aspects that are related to the question [6], such as genes, proteins, diseases, mutations, etc. Hence it is important for a biomedical in-formation retrieval (IR) system to provide comprehensive and diverse answers to fulfill biologists X  information needs. In the TREC 2006 and 2007 Genomics tracks, the  X  X spect retrieval X  was investigated. Its purpose was to study how a biomedical IR system can support a user gather information about the different aspects of a topic. Aspects of a retrieved passage could be a list of named entities or MeSH terms, representing answers that cover different portions of a full answer to the query. Aspect Mean Average Precision (As-pect MAP) was defined in the Genomics tracks to capture similarities and differences among retrieved passages. It is a measurement for diversity of the IR ranked list [5]. The Genomics aspect retrieval was firstly proposed in the TREC 2006 Genomics track and further investigated in the 2007 Genomics track. However, to the best of our knowl-edge, there is not too much previous work conducted on the Genomics aspect retrieval for promoting diversity in the ranked list. University of Wisconsin re-ranked the re-trieved passages using a clustering-based approach named GRASSHOPPER to promote ranking diversity [4]. Unfor-tunately, for the Genomics aspect retrieval, this re-ranking method hurt their system X  X  performance and decreased the Aspect MAP of the original results [4]. Later in the TREC 2007 Genomics track, most teams tried to obtain the aspect level performance through their passage level results, instead of working on the aspect level retrieval directly [3, 6].
In this paper, we first propose a survival modeling ap-proach to measuring the novel information provided by an aspect with respect to its occurrences. Then, the relevance and novelty of a retrieved document are combined at the aspect level. Evaluation results show that the proposed ap-proach is effective in biomedical search result diversification.
Survival analysis is a statistical methodology used for mod-eling and evaluating survival data, also called time-to-event data, where one is interested in the occurrence of events [2]. Survival time refers to a variable which measures the time from a particular starting time to a particular endpoint of interest. Events are usually referred as birth, death and fail-ure that happen to an individual in the context of study. For example, in clinical trial, one may interested in the number of days that patient can survive in the study of the effective-ness of a new treatment for a disease. Formally, the survival function is defined as: where t is a specific time, T is a random variable denoting the time of death, and  X  X r X  stands for probability. That is, the survival function gives the probability that the time of death is later than a specified time t . The survival function must be non-increasing: S ( u )  X  S ( t )if u&gt;t . Usually one assumes S (0) = 1, that is, at the start of the study, the probability of surviving past time zero is one. The sur-vival function is also assumed to approach zero as t increases without bound [2].

In the context of information retrieval, aspects covered by a document can be considered as treatments, a document can be considered as a patient in the clinical trial case. The number of times that an aspect has been observed can be considered as the survival time. The new information that can be provided by an aspect corresponds to the effective-ness of a treatment. One can expect that, in a ranked list, as the number of times that an aspect has been observed increases, the new information that this aspect can provide to a document decreases. For example, in a ranked docu-ment list, when aspect  X  X troke treatment X  is observed in the j th document at the first time, the information provided by this aspect should be counted as completely new. We pre-sume that X  X troke treatment X  X n the j th document covers the topic of  X  X edications taken by mouth for long-term stroke treatment X . Then, when aspect  X  X troke treatment X  is ob-served again in the k th ( k&gt;j ) document of the ranked list, it may provide new information about  X  X njection for short-term stroke treatment X , but it is also possible that it only provides redundant information about  X  X edications taken by mouth for long-term stroke treatment X . As we can see, this situation satisfies the properties of the survival function described above.

We assume that the occurrences of an aspect follow Pois-son distribution. Then, the survival model derived from Equation 1 can be formally written as: where  X  is the rate parameter of Poisson distribution. The value of S a j ( x ) states the probability of obtaining new infor-mation from aspect a j ( j =1 , 2 , ..., n ;where n is the number of observed aspects) after it has been observed x times. Note that in this paper, the aspects covered by a retrieved docu-ment are presented by concepts detected from Wikipedia [9].
For retrieved documents, the document rankings should depend on which documents the user has already seen. Sup-pose that we have ranked top i  X  1 documents, and now we need to decide which document should be ranked at the i th position in the ranking list. The document that can deliver the most new and relevant aspects should be considered as the i th document in the ranking list. Assume that aspect novelty and aspect query-relevance are independent of each other. Then given previous ranked i  X  1 documents, we rank the i th document using the following scoring function: where a j is an aspect detected from document d i ,which follows Poisson distribution with an estimated rate param-eter. P ( New and Rel | a j ) denotes the probability that a query-relevant and can provide new information as well.
P ( New | a j ) in Equation 3 states the probability of ob-taining new information from aspect a j ,whichcanbecal-culated using the survival models proposed in Section 2. P ( New | a j )=1when i = 1. Since we do not usually have relevance information, P ( a j | Rel ) is unavailable. One possible solution, as introduced in [7], is to consider that the best bet is to relate the probability of aspect a j to the conditional probability of observing a j given the query: P ( a j | Rel )  X  P ( a j | Q ). P ( a j | Q ) can be calculated by the two-stage model presented in [9].
We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the effec-tiveness of the proposed model on the TREC 2006 and 2007 Genomics collections. For the 2007 X  X  topics, three baseline runs are used, which are NLMinter [3], MuMshFd [8] and an Okapi run [1]. NLMinter and MuMshFd were two of the most competitive IR runs submitted to the TREC 2007 Ge-nomics track. For 2006 X  X  topics, we test our approach on three Okapi runs. In this paper, we mainly focus on the Aspect mean average precision (MAP), since our objective is to promote diversity in the IR ranked list.

Evaluation results of using the proposed approach for doc-ument re-ranking are shown in Table 1. The values in the parentheses are the relative rates of improvement over the original results. As we can see, our approach achieves promis-ing and consistent performance improvements over all base-line runs. Performance improvements can be observed on both levels of evaluation measures. It is worth mention-ing that our approach can further improve the best result (NLMinter) reported in the TREC 2007 Genomics track by achieving 18 . 9% improvement on Aspect MAP and 11% im-provement on Passage2 MAP.
In this paper, we propose a survival modeling approach to promoting ranking diversity for biomedical information retrieval. The probabilistic survival model derived from the survival analysis theory measures the probability that novel information can be provided by an aspect with respect to its occurrences. Experimental results show that the proposed survival model can successfully capture the novel informa-tion delivered by aspects and achieve significant improve-ments on ranking diversity. We also show that combining the novelty and the relevance of a retrieved document at the aspect level is an effective way of promoting diversity of the ranked list, while keeping the relevance of retrieved docu-ments. The proposed approach not only achieves promising performance improvements on the diversity based evalua-tion measure, but also on the relevance based evaluation measure.
