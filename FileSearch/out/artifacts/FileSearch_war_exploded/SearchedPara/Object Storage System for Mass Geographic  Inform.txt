 Most computer technology is designed to increase a decision-maker X  X  access to relevant data. GIS (geographic information system) [1] [2] [9] is much more than mapping software. GIS goes beyond mining data to give us the tools to interpret that data, allowing us to see relationships, patterns, or trends intuitively that are not about modeling and mapping the world for better decision making. GIS tools range from simple contact mapping tools to co nsumer analysis to complex enterprise systems that are part of an organizati on X  X  overall enterprise resource planning infrastructure. 
In the early decades of GIS, professi onals concentrated primarily on data compilation and focused application projects, spending a majority of their time creating GIS databases and authoring geographic knowledge. Gradually, GIS professionals began to use and exploit thes e knowledge collections in numerous GIS applications and settings. Users applied comprehensive GIS workstations to compile geographic data sets, build work flows for data compilation and quality control, author maps and analytical models, and document their work and methods. 
This reinforced the traditional view of a GIS user with a professional scientific workstation that connected to data sets and databases. The workstation had a comprehensive GIS application with adva nced GIS logic and tools to accomplish almost any GIS task. Recent developments in computing X  X he growth of the Internet, advances in DBMS technology, object-based storage [4 ] [5] [7] [8], GIS Grid [3], mobile computing, and wide GIS adoption to X  X ave led to an evolving vision and role for GIS. However, including GIS desktops, GIS software is required to be centralized in application servers and Web servers to deliver GIS capabilities to any number of users over networks. Focused sets of GIS logic can be embedded and deployed in custom applications. And increasingly, GIS is deployed in mobile devices. 
Also, enterprise GIS users connect to central GIS servers using traditional, GIS desktops as well as Web browsers, focused applications, mobile computing devices, and digital appliances. This vision of the GIS platform is expanding and the storage of spatial object is required high availability and high scalability. Spatial information resources are the composition of different application systems. Spatial data are multi-terabyte and require massive storage system. The architecture of spatial data is objects, fundamental containers that house both application data and an extensible set of object attributes. Nowadays, new storage architecture is emerging. OSS (object storage system) [5] is the foundation for building massively parallel storage systems that leverage commodity processing, networking, and storage components to deliver unprecedented scalability and aggregate throughput in a cost-effective and manageable package. And OSS can be extended in WAN (wide area technology, GIS attains more intelligent and enables the capture and sharing of geographic knowledge in many forms X  X dvanced GIS data sets, maps, data models, the expertise of professionals who have developed standardized work flows, and advanced models of geographic processes. Intelligent GIS also enables the building and management of knowledge repositories that can be published for others to use. 2.1 The Components of Object Storage System In the OSS, objects are primitive, logical units of storage that can be directly accessed on an object storage controller (OSC). The OSS built from the OSCs is shown in Figure 1. A metadata server (MS) provides the information necessary to directly access objects, along with other information about data including its attributes, security keys, and permissions (authentication). The OSCs export object-based interface, and the access/storage unit is object. It operates in a mode in which data is organized and accessed as objects rather than as an ordered sequence of sectors. Clients contact with MS and get the information about objects. The OSCs receive and process those requests with some policies. In our previous work [5], smart object storage controller is introduced. 
Metadata is frequently described as  X  X ata about data X  [6]. In MS, metadata is the data useful. It is information we need to know in order to use the data. Metadata represents a set of characteristics about the data that are normally not contained within the data itself. Metadata could include: (1) An inventory of existing data; (2) Definitions of the names and data items; (3) A keyword list of names and definitions; steps performed on the data including how it was collected; (6) Documentation of the data structures and data models used; (7) A recording of the steps used on the data for analysis. Spatial metadata is important because it not only describes what the data is, but it can reduce the size of spatial data sets. By creating metadata, users are creating a standard in naming, defining, cataloging, and operating standards. This in turn is a vital foundation for understanding, collaborating, and sharing resources with others. 2.2 Spatial Object Data, Attributes and Methods set of sectors associated with an object ID (OID). Data is referenced by the OID and the media by the OSC itself, while the operating system manages its files and metadata in these object constructs, instead of managing sectors of data. 1. Spatial object data 
The backbone of GIS is good data. Inaccurate data can result in inaccurate models and maps, skewing the results of our analysis and ultimately resulting in poor decisions.  X  X arbage in, garbage out, X  as the adage says. The wide availability makes data for our needs. Geography is information about the earth X  X  surface and the objects found on it. This spatial object data comes in two basic forms: (1) Map data. Map data contains the location and shape of geographic features. (called polygons). (2) Image data. Image data ranges from satellite images and aerial photographs to scanned maps (maps that have been conve rted from printed to digital format). 
A GIS stores information about the world as a collection of themed layers that can be used together. A layer can be anything that contains similar features such as customers, buildings, streets, lakes, or postal codes. 
This spatial object data contains either an explicit geographic reference, such as a code, census tract name, forest stand identifier, or road name. 2. Spatial object attributes 
Spatial object attributes are the descriptive spatial object data that GIS links to map states, census tracts, cities, and so on and often comes packaged with map data. 
Each spatial object has one or more attributes that identify what the object is, describe it, or represent some magnitude associated with the object. There are five types of spatial attribute: categories, ranks, counts, amounts, ratios. 
Categories are groups of similar things. They help us organize and make sense of spatial objects. All spatial objects with the same value for a category are alike in some way and different from objects with other values for that category. Ranks put spatial objects in order from high to low. Ranks are used when direct measures are difficult or if the quantity represents a combination of factors. Counts and amounts show amount can be any measurable quantity associated with a spatial object such as the number of employees at a business. Using a count or amount lets users see the actual value of each object as well as its magnitude compared to other spatial objects. Ratios show users the relationship between two quantities and are created by dividing one quantity by another, for each spatial object. 3. Spatial object methods 
Spatial object methods define the behavior of geographically integrated features and manage connectivity among features in a set of feature classes. Method may be a user-defined modular operation on stream data, and it is applied to per-object basis. combination with accurate file layout. The second is from existing file system and depends on user input. The third is from file content analysis. But, spatial object, as a fundamental storage component in an OSC, is different from storage in traditional storage device. And spatial object provides ample hints for OSC, which are help for designing intelligent GIS. 
Intelligent GIS makes it possible to digitally encapsulate geographic knowledge and is engineered to support this knowledge-based approach. OSC is the building block of the system and can be built from off-the-shelf components. Like other intelligent disks, it has processor, memory, network interface and block-based disk interface, and thus has ability to do intelligent processing on spatial object stored in it. Spatial object attributes makes the GIS be adaptive to more application fields. Users can register and upload methods (or rules) at storage device and associate a spatial object with a chain of methods [5]. Any kind of operations on spatial objects can be performed by the method chains which are executed by taking the object as input stream in an OSC. The OSC has explored two promising enhancement: object-based interface and embedded computational capability, and it improves the scalability of storage system. 
For instance, as in other database management systems, numerous data updates are constantly being posted to an OSC in GIS. Hence, GIS database in an OSC, like other databases, must support update transactions. However, GIS users have some specialized transactional requirements. The main concept underlying this is often can involve changes to multiple rows in multiple tables. Users need to be able to undo and redo their changes before they are committed. Editing sessions can span a few disconnected from the central, shared database. In many cases, database updates pass through a series of phases. GIS work flow processes may span days and months. Yet the GIS database still requires continuous availability for daily operations where users might have their own views or states of the shared GIS database. By registering version control method, GIS can process su ch long transaction according to users X  management policy. 
Geographic intelligence is inherently distributed and loosely integrated. Rarely is schema. GIS users count on one another for portions of their GIS spatial objects. 
An important component in GIS is a GIS metadata portal with a registry of the numerous spatial object holdings and information sets. A number of GIS users act as special object stewards who compile and publish their spatial object sets for shared use by other organizations (by organization metadata server). They register their information sets at an organization metadata portal. By searching a GIS metadata portal, other GIS users can find and connect to desired information sets. 
The GIS metadata portal is a Web site where GIS users can search for and find GIS information relevant to their needs and, as such, depends on a network of published GIS data services, map services, and metadata services. Periodically, a GIS metadata portal site can harvest metadata from a collection of participating sites to publish one organization metadata. 
Thus, an organization metadata can reference object holdings contained at its site as well as at other sites. It is envisioned that a series of OSS metadata servers will be documented in OSS metadata records in an O SS metadata that can be searched to find candidates for use in various GIS applications. In the digital computing age, people begun to capture everything they know and share it across networks. These knowledge collections are rapidly becoming digitally enabled. Simultaneously, GIS is evolving to help us better understand, represent, manage, and communicate many aspects of our earth as a system. For GIS, there is an increasing demand for storage capacity and throughput. Thus, there is a need for storage architectures that scale with the processing power with the growing size of geographic dataset. In this paper, the object storage system is introduced to the GIS. It shelf components, the cost is much smaller. Second, OSC can store integrated spatial objects and provides object interface for GIS. Third, OSS enhances the intelligence of GIS by introducing the concept of method, which performs on a spatial object.
