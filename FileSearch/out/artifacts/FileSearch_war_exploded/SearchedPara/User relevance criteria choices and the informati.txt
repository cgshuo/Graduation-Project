 1. Introduction
Research has shown a user considers various criteria beyond topicality in making their relevance judgment. That these criteria are related to relevance judgments is clear, but few studies have examined how these relevance criteria may change as the user progresses through the information search process (ISP). A dynamic relevance judgment process suggests a dynamic cognitive state, with user relevance judgments changing over time as cognitive state changes. As these relevance judgments change, it is likely that the criteria used to make those judgments also changes. The studies detailed here exam-ined relevance criteria choices in relation to an information search process. 1.1. Statement and significance of problem
A user with an information need must proceed through an information gathering process which may involve multiple search sessions and retrieval of documents or document representations. As users retrieve documents, they make relevance judgments about documents reviewed based on various criteria. As the users X  cognitive state changes, the criteria which are important to their relevance judgments may also change.
Previous information science research has provided little guidance in what relevance criteria are important to users, and when in the search process those criteria are important. Identifying associations between relevance criteria choices, rele-vance judgments, and search stage would provide insights into changes in the users X  cognitive state. Findings of associations would inform the design of search systems. Improved search system design could extend basic topical search queries with additional criteria, and could adapt information retrieval (IR) processing to the users X  cognitive state changes as they pro-gress through the ISP. 1.2. Research questions
The two studies detailed in this paper examined the relationship between relevance judgments, the criteria used to make those judgments, and progress through the information search process (ISP). Subjects were presented with a research prob-lem which required them to search for and gather information. As the subjects gathered information, data was captured on the relevance judgments of the subjects, the criteria subjects use to make those judgments, and the subject X  X  progress through the ISP. The following research questions were examined in these studies.
 Which relevance criteria are selected by users and when in the information search process are they selected?
Do users have a preference for specific relevance criteria in making their relevance judgment in relation to a user-identified stage in the search process as indicated by the frequency of criterion selection? 1.3. Review of literature
Relevance is dynamic, changing as time progresses. Mizzaro (1998) specifically refers to this property of relevance as the  X  X  X ime dimension X  X . He indicates that what may be relevant at one point in time may not be relevant at another point. In his formal model, Mizzaro sees a user in a  X  X  X roblematic situation X  X  progressing through three operations: perception, expression and formalization which results in a query. These operations are a function of time.

Cosijn and Ingwersen (2000) built on the work of Saracevic, (1975, 1996, 2006a, 2006b ) and others to develop a revised interpreted as a dimension by the authors and the manifestations of relevance are identified as topical, cognitive/pertinence, situational/utility and socio-cognitive. These manifestations represent expressions of cognitive changes and can be associ-ated with the relevance criteria and categories identified in the user-centered cognitive studies by Barry (1994) and others and affective and cognitive aspects of the user affect relevance judgments. The research detailed here examines the mani-festations of these interactions as the criteria used by searchers to judge relevance. Recent research has identified criteria and groups of criteria as detailed in the next section. 1.4. Relevance criteria research
Schamber (1991) conducted a study which identified a number of criteria used by subjects to judge relevance. Barry (1994) later conducted a study which identified 23 categories of relevance criteria. Barry and Schamber (1998) later com-bined the data collected from the Barry (1994) study with Schamber (1991) . Despite the diversity of subjects X  backgrounds, there was consistency in the criteria selected by the groups in the two different studies.

The relevance criteria and categories reported in these studies have been identified in other studies ( Maglaughlin &amp; Son-nenwald, 2002; Park, 1993; Tang &amp; Solomon, 1998 ). The criteria identified, however, did conflate environmental/situational characteristics such as obtainability/cost with document characteristics such as depth/scope and recency. While this iden-tification and categorization is consistent with Barry X  X  exploratory research goals, it does mix the cognitive and situational aspects of relevance judgments. More recent research examined either the groupings or selection of these criteria ( Crystal &amp;
Greenberg, 2006; Maglaughlin &amp; Sonnenwald, 2002; Park, 1993; Schamber &amp; Bateman, 1996; Wang &amp; Soergel, 1998; Xu, 2007 ). 1.5. Relevance judgments and the information search process
A number of studies have examined relevance judgments, and in some cases the criteria used to make those judgments, in relation to an information search process. Wang and Soergel (1998) performed an analysis which included an observation that the  X  X pistemic value X  of a document was the prerequisite for all other values for the document, a conclusion that may be partially explained by the sample bias towards knowledgeable subjects.

Bateman (1998) used relevance criteria identified by Barry (1994, 1998) , and Schamber and Bateman (1996) to examine relevance judgments during the ISP. Bateman (1998) reported that subjects moved through the ISP in an uneven manner, with some respondents reporting being in multiple stages at once (ibid, p. 27). Though she did track criteria selections during the ISP, she did not report changes in criteria selections across search stages, contradicting other studies which did report such changes ( Tang &amp; Solomon, 2001; Taylor et al., 2007; Vakkari, 2001; Vakkari &amp; Hakala, 2000 ).
Tang and Solomon (1998) conducted a series of studies with a single subject. They reported more certainty in later stages of the ISP, and reported that some criteria decrease in importance in later stages. Wang and White (1999) conducted a study with seven graduate students and reported more criteria used during positive relevance judgments. The study did not report the criteria used to make the judgments in relation to ISP stages. Tang and Solomon (2001) reported results which suggest a change in the selection of some relevance criteria, when moving across stages in the ISP for some criteria (clarity, impor-tance, newness, recency, topical focus, topical relatedness) but the authors do not report the statistical significance of these changes. ( Vakkari, 2000; Vakkari &amp; Hakala, 2000 ) performed a broader study examining six ISP stages and a number of criteria used to determine relevance. The researcher noted that the categories of  X  X  X ovelty X  X  and  X  X  X nterest X  X  were selected more during the later stages of the ISP, and  X  X  X opicality X  X  was the most commonly selected criteria. The study used a small sample size, and its analysis and conclusions were based on limited reporting of descriptive statistics.

Serola and Vakkari (2005) examined the impact of two common relevance criteria, topicality and usefulness, during a search process, specifically the preparation of a research paper. Researchers noted that the search behavior of subject X  X  chan-ged as they progressed through the process of gathering information to prepare a paper. Subjects became more proficient at recognizing the utility and topicality of documents. As the researchers note, as the subjects read documents, they gained knowledge, their cognitive state changed, and this in turn impacted their search behavior.

Taylor et al. (2007) performed a broad study of the criteria selections during an information search process. Researchers identified criteria used for relevance judgments by performing content analysis of comments made by subjects during doc-with 300 undergraduate students was used. Researchers used four search stages consistent with Kuhlthau (1993) . Findings suggested criteria selection changes, by subjects, as they progressed through a search for documents relevant to an informa-tion need. The authors report a statistically significant relationship in terms of frequency of selection for the preference of elty X  X  and  X  X  X nterest X  X ).

The studies examined the dynamic nature of relevance judgments by observing subjects both directly and indirectly during the ISP. The selection of categories for ISP stages or search behaviors varied, and was, in some cases, extremely narrow, potentially missing subtle changes in the behavior of users. With the exception of Vakkari (1999) and Taylor et al. (2007) , this research did not focus on specific interactions between choices among criteria for relevance judgment and the progression through the ISP. With the exception of Tang and Solomon (2001) and Taylor et al. (2007) , sample sizes were too small to allow for strong statistical analysis beyond descriptive statistics.

Of the studies identified here, only Vakkari (2000) and Taylor et al. (2007) examined the relationship between ISP or stage in task completion, and criteria choices during the relevance judgment process, in combination with the use of three levels of relevance including partial relevance. This is important since research has shown that partial relevance is common early in the search process, and it is these partially relevant documents which are re-evaluated later in the search process using var-ious criteria ( Spink, Greisdorf, &amp; Bateman, 1998; Tang &amp; Solomon, 1998). 1.6. Justification for research
To advance understanding of the dynamic relevance judgment process, these studies examined interactions during the relevance judgment process directly, and used stronger statistical methods to provide additional clarity and depth. Our research examined criterion choices and their evolution during the ISP using the complete range of relevance judgments (including partial relevance). Additionally, use of a larger sample size and more sensitive statistical methods added to the od of content analysis of subject comments or interviews used in previous studies ( Bateman, 1998; Taylor et al., 2007;
Vakkari, 2000; Wang &amp; White, 1999 ). This more direct approach is grounded in the common identification of these criteria in numerous studies which provides some confirmation of their validity. These studies examined a number of these aspects of relevance dynamics in a single study, allowing various interactions to be examined with a single subject pool. The studies also examined relevance criteria interactions in depth, using more finely grained criteria choices. 1.7. Research design  X  Studies 1 and 2
A convenience sample of subjects was drawn from a sample of junior and senior business students at an American university. Subjects were students in a business class, and were assigned a research project as part of a class assignment (see Appendix E ). Their progress on gathering information for their assigned research project was used to collect data for the study. Subjects were allowed to choose a research topic from a list of predetermined research topics. Research topics were of the same level of difficulty for subjects and the structure and rubric for grading the assignment were the same.
Though the research assignment was a required part of the curriculum for the class, the student X  X  participation as a subject providing data for this study was voluntary.

The studies were conducted using identical methods in different time frames with different subject sample pools. Study 1 was performed first, followed by Study 2. Study 2 collected additional data on importance weights for relevance criteria weights which is not analyzed in this study. 2. Data collection  X  Studies 1 and 2
Data was collected through a Web site which contained detailed instructions for the subjects on the use of the site and how to provide information about their searches and relevance judgments (Appendices F-K). The site was accessible from the
Internet with any Web browser, thus allowing subjects to perform their searches without intrusive monitoring. Participants were also provided instruction on using the research Web site and allowed to practice using the site as part of a tutorial ses-sion. Students could conduct multiple searches. For each search, subjects identified relevant documents and criteria used in the selection of those documents.

The sample of 82 subjects from a population of undergraduate students at an American university participated in the study in Fall 2007. Subjects examined and reported on a total of 758 distinct documents found on the Web.

Sixty-four of the 82 subjects provided background information in the form of a survey. These results indicated that approximately 36% of the subjects reported searching for information once a day, and approximately 41% reported searching for information several times a day. Approximately 64% of the subjects were male, and 35% were female. Most subjects (77%) indicated English was their primary language. 3. Search process  X  Studies 1 and 2
The search stage model (see Table 1 ) used the search phases suggested by Wilson (1999) which combine the information behaviors of Ellis (1997) with the search process of Kuhlthau (1991, 1993) . The term  X  X  X nitiation X  X  was used because it pro-vides a clearer term than  X  X  X eginning X  X  or  X  X  X tarting. X  X  The term  X  X  X rowsing X  X  was avoided in this study since this term is now commonly used for all Web-related searching. Instead, the term  X  X  X xploration X  X  was used to describe the process of scan-ning and gathering information. The remaining terms,  X  X  X ifferentiating, X  X   X  X  X xtracting X  X  and  X  X  X erifying X  X  are from Ellis (1997) and were used in lieu of Kuhlthau X  X  terminology because they provide a more finely grained description of the subject X  X  pro-gression through the search process. The term  X  X  X nding X  X  was not used since there was no requirement for subjects to formally end the search process. The search stage descriptions presented to the subject are shown in the  X  X  X escription Displayed to Subject X  X  column in Table 1 . These descriptions were succinct since they had to appear in a relatively small pop-up window.
The term  X  X ocus X  was not used in the description of the  X  X ifferentiating X  stage since the subject X  X  were more familiar with the term  X  X ubtopic X  and the need to find various related subtopics to produce a good report. Subjects were provided a review of the meaning of search stages and an information search process and help pages were available to explain the terms and pro-vide longer descriptions (see Appendix L ). 4. Relevance criteria  X  Studies1 and 2
Table 2 contains the relevance criteria choices presented to subjects in Studies 1 and 2. These criteria were identified pre-viously and validated in studies by Barry (1994, 1998), Barry and Schamber (1998) , and Cool et al. (1993) . Other studies have identified these criteria and have provided some confirmation as to their consistency across information retrieval (IR) tasks ( Park, 1993; Xu &amp; Chen, 2006 ; Schamber, 1991 ; Schamber &amp; Bateman, 1996 ).

Because of the consistency of the selection of these criteria in IR literature across multiple studies, these criteria were used as the baseline for this study. To avoid survey exhaustion by overloading the subject with too many choices, a subset pop-up window in the Web browser. This limited the number of criteria to between 15 and 20. To reduce the criteria to this number, the most common criteria were selected and multiple criteria which referred to the same concept were merged into one. Generic criteria terms were chosen over criteria specific to one subject.

These criteria were presented to the subjects not as one or two word criteria terms, but using the contents of the  X  X  X escrip-tion X  X  column in Table 2 . After completing a search and evaluating documents, subjects were asked to choose one or more criteria which they used to make their relevance judgment.
 5. Data collection process  X  Studies 1 and 2
Each subject performed searches at their convenience and at their own pace within the parameters of the assignment deliverable due dates. Specifically, the process of searching for information and reporting on results of the search as part of this research study was as follows.

Subjects logged into the research Web site to conduct their search using a login ID previously assigned, and a personal password they had chosen.

Subjects entered search query terms as if they were using a commercial search engine such as Yahoo! and executed a search (see Appendix F ). The search results were returned by the Yahoo! search engine and reformatted in a Web page of results to allow user selection of relevance criteria, search stage, and criteria used to judge relevance ( Appendix G ).
The research Web site generated a search results page with a list of results returned by a commercial search engine for the search query the user entered. For each result returned, the search results page included an explanation of the result page/document (as returned by the commercial search engine), links to the results page, and links which the user used to enter relevance information about the page (see Appendix G ).

Subjects were asked to enter a relevance judgment for the document, a search stage which identifies where the subject was in their search process when they made the judgment, and criteria which were considered by the subject in making that judgment (see Appendices H-J). Relevance assessments were one of either relevant , not relevant ,or partially relevant/ not sure (from Greisdorf, 2003; Spink et al., 1998 ). Criteria choices available to the subjects were those identified in Table 2 . To address issues of order effects, these choices were randomized in the list of relevance criteria choices displayed to the subjects. In Study 2, subjects could indicate a degree of importance for their criteria selection.

When the subjects finished providing information for the documents reviewed on the results page, they submitted the information they entered to the data collection program on the research Web site which stored the results anonymously for later analysis.

Subjects repeated the process outlined above as often as they felt necessary and whenever they wished in order to gather the information they needed to complete their assigned report. 6. Results
Data was collected for each search conducted by the user. For each search, the user identified the documents which were relevant for the search and then identified the criteria which were used to identify relevance. The focus of the analysis was on the criteria used to judge relevance, not on the search query, so search queries and number of searches were not evalu-ated. The frequency counts for criteria used to judge relevance in relation to stage in the information search process were the basis of all analysis conducted for Studies 1 and 2.

The goal was to perform strong statistical analysis of variance. Preliminary tests indicated the data results collected did not exhibit a normal distribution with this sample. Since the chi square statistical method is considered robust with smaller sample sizes with non-normal distributions, this method was chosen. Statistical analysis of variance requires use of frequency counts which are reported in for each study in Appendices A-D.

The criteria of  X  X opic X  was presented to subjects and data on the selection of this criteria was collected, but the analysis performed for this study assumes document topicality (the document was on topic) and the selection of this criteria is not part of this analysis. 6.1. Results: Study 1
Chart 1 provides a graphic presentation of the frequency counts for criteria selected in each search stage for Study 1. This in later search stages.

Chi square tests determined that the increase in preference for 13 of the 19 criteria presented to the subjects was statis-related and the relationship is statistically strong for the criteria shown in this table. These results provide a statistically strong indication that users are evaluating documents differently, using different criteria to make those relevance judgments as they progress through the search process. These 13 criteria were more important to subjects based on frequency of selec-tion in later search stages.

Statistical analysis using the chi square method indicates correlation and the interaction of two variables, but does not provide an indication of directionality or the cause and effect between two variables. In this analysis, the subject may have been more inclined to select a particular criteria because of a search stage selection, or may have been more inclined to select a search stage because of the criteria they had selected. Subjects in this study self-reported their search stage and demon-strated a clear tendency to report certain search stages as shown in Table 4 . These results indicate the  X  X xtracting X  stage has been selected with over three times the frequency of the  X  X xploration X  stage. This selectivity provides a strong indication that some portion of this variability in selection of criteria was due to the unequal selection of search stage by subjects. To mit-igate this tendency and strengthen the statistical results of this analysis, additional analysis was performed which involved folding certain search stage results into combined categories The analysis for Study 1 combined the  X  X  X nitiation, X  X   X  X  X xplora-tion X  X  and  X  X  X ifferentiating X  X  stages into an  X  X  X arly X  X  search stage. As the results in Table 4 show, this combination provides a frequency count which is 70% of the frequency count for the  X  X  X xtracting X  X  stage, providing a basis for an approximately equal comparison between early search stage relevance judgments ( X  X  X nitiation X  X  through  X  X  X xploration X  X ) and later search stage judg-ments ( X  X  X xtracting X  X ).

Chart 2 provides a graphic presentation of the relationship between early and late search stages and relevance criteria selections. These results demonstrate an increase in the selection of all criteria in later search stages, with the criteria of  X  X mount of information X  moving from the fourth most selected in early search stages to third most selected in the later search stage. A dichotomous analysis of variance test between early and later search stages generated the statistical results shown for these variables and thus these criteria were more important to subjects in the later search stage ( X  X  X xtracting information X  X ). 6.2. Results: Study 2
Study 2 used methods identical to Study 1 but collected additional data from subjects including allowing subjects to indi-cate a degree of importance for selected criteria. To allow cross-comparison with Study 1 results, the criteria selected with a level of importance of  X  X  X omewhat important, X  X   X  X  X mportant, X  X  and  X  X  X ery important X  X  were used in this analysis. (Analysis of these importance weights is not a part of this study.)
Chart 3 provides a graphic presentation of the criteria selection in relation to search stage. These results indicate the cri-teria of  X  X  X ccuracy X  X  was consistently considered important to subjects across all search stages. The criteria of  X  X  X uthority, X  X   X  X  X tructure, X  X   X  X  X ecency, X  X  and  X  X  X uidelines X  X  appeared to increase in importance to subjects as they progressed through the teria of  X  X ias X  and  X  X istory X . These results provide some indication of variance, but the tendency to select more documents in general in the  X  X  X xtracting X  X  stage provides a partial explanation for the variance found. As was done with Study 1, this ten-dency was mitigated by folding results into combined categories.

To mitigate search stage selection tendencies, an early search stage category was created. A comparison of early search an increase in selection in the later search stage. Analysis indicated that 6 of these criteria demonstrated a statistically sig-nificant association with search stage as shown in Table 7 ( p &lt; .001). These results suggest that these criteria were more important to subjects in later search stages, further strengthening the association between criteria selection and search stage with this sample. 7. Cross-study analysis of results
The purpose of these two studies was to evaluate the relationship between criteria selections and stage in search pro-cess. Table 8 contains a cross study comparison of the statistically significant findings of association between criteria selections and stage in search process. This adds strength to the findings in the individual studies that criteria choices change due to cognitive state changes across search stages. Furthermore, that these criteria are statistically significant in different studies with different samples demonstrates repeatability of findings, adding additional statistical strength to these findings.

A statistically significant association for the criteria of  X  X  X bility to understand X  X  was found across the two studies, further strengthening the finding of association. This may be a another indication that the  X  X  X bility to understand X  X  along with the  X  X pistemic value X  of a document ( Wang &amp; Soergel, 1998 ) is a basic prerequisite for positive relevance judgments. become more important to subjects as they progress through the search process may be an indication that as subjects become more discerning in making relevance judgments later in the search process, their evaluation focuses on these cri-teria. This may be a reflection of issues involved with using the unorganized, unevaluated, raw information available on the Web to perform research. As subjects progressed through the search process, they became more discerning in their evaluations, and they sought new documents ( X  X  X ovelty X  X ) with a navigable document structure ( X  X  X ource quality X  X ) from accurate sources ( X  X  X ccuracy X  X ). Also, later in the search process, time is limited and the time constraints of the research project assignment loom (subjects had a deadline for submission of work), as reflected in the selection of the  X  X  X ime X  X  criterion.
 8. Discussion
Subjects in these studies demonstrated varying selectivity for criteria, selectivity which varied as they progressed through the search process. These results suggest the subjects X  cognitive state changed as they gathered information to complete their search. These cognitive changes manifest in changes in the criteria used to make relevance judgments. These results provide strong statistical evidence of the dynamic nature of relevance and suggest the importance of dynamic, adaptive IR systems.

These statistically significant findings indicate that as users progressed through the search process their relevance judg-ments became more discerning as they seek documents with new information, results consistent with previous studies which reported some evidence of changes in criteria choices across various search stage models (Hirsh, 1999; Tang &amp; Solo-mon, 2001; Vakkari, 2001; Vakkari &amp; Hakala, 2000; Wang &amp; White, 1999) and add strength to these studies, and to previous statistical studies ( Taylor et al., 2007 ). These results contradict the findings of Bateman (1998) which reported no change in the use of criteria for relevance judgments across the search process. These results specifically confirm the findings of Vakk-ari (2001) in respect to the selection of  X  X ovelty X  as a criteria which is more important to subjects in later search stages.
This study provides additional findings through the use of a more detailed search stage model and findings of user pref-erence for specific criteria across the stages of this search model as shown in Table 8 . 9. Conclusion
The criteria used to judge relevance effectively provides a lens into the cognitive changes occurring during the informa-tion search process. Prior research has identified criteria used to judge relevance and has suggested how these criteria are selected and when, but knowledge of specific selection of criteria in relation to the information search process is incomplete.
The purpose of these two studies was to add to the body of knowledge concerning relevance criteria choices by examining how these choices change over the course of an information search process.

These results indicate that across two studies amidst the highly variable selection of documents with distinct topics, con-sistency could be found in the frequency of selection of a number of relevance criteria in relation to progress through an information search process. These results help clarify our understanding of relevance and provide a richer picture of the complex, dynamic process of relevance judgments.

These results provide further evidence that IR systems should become more adaptive to the cognitive changes of users during the search process, and must provide a richer set of search criteria beyond topicality. These results provide sugges-research should extend this research and focus on domain-specific criteria, and the impact of the availability of criteria choices in search query results. 10. Limitations
The research methods employed allowed subjects to select topicality as a criteria, but did not specifically analyze topi-cality in relation to the selection of other criteria. This approach was based on the assumption that the document first needed focused on the use of more specific relevance criteria.

Additional influences on relevance decisions are known to be user X  X  background or knowledge of the subject domain, and search task. The convenience sample for this research was drawn from a pool of undergraduate students who are business majors in a business school at an American university. All students were taking the same course and were given the same assignment, thus all had the same work task. These influences are mitigated in this study by drawing from a subject pool whose members have similar backgrounds, experiences, and domain knowledge. Though this aspect of the design of these studies attempted to control for variations in domain knowledge, variations in knowledge may exist within the subject pool. The choice of this convenience sample also limits the generalizability of the results.

Subjects were presented with descriptions for search stage and criteria used to judge relevance. Subjects were given an explanation of search stages, the information search process and relevance judgments and the online system used for data collection provided help pages with additional information on these terms and concepts. But there is the possibility that sub-jects may have misinterpreted these concepts during the selection process. Additionally, the fragmented nature of informa-tion on the Web where the subjects collected their information and the general information search habits of the demographic used as subjects are potential intervening variables in the relevance judgment process.
