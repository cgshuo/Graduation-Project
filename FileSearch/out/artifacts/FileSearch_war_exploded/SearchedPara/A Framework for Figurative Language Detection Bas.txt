 Various text mining algorithms require the pro-cess of feature selection. For example, author-ship attribution algorithms need to determine fea-tures to quantify the writing style. Previous work on authorship attribution among computer scien-tists is mostly based on low-level features such as word frequencies, sentence length counts, n-grams etc. A significant advantage of such features is that they can be easily extracted from any corpus. But the study by Batov and Sorokin (1975) shows that such features do not always provide accurate measures for authorship attribution. The linguistic approach to the problem involves such high-level characteristics as the use of figurative language, irony, sound devices and so on. Such character-istics are very promising for the mentioned above tasks, but the extraction of these features is ex-tremely hard to automate. As a result, very few attempts have been made to exploit high-level fea-tures for stylometric purposes (Stamatatos, 2009). Therefore, our long-term objective is the extrac-tion of high-level semantically rich features.
Since the mentioned topic is very broad, we fo-cus our attention only on some particular prob-lems and approaches. In this paper, we examine one of such problems, the problem of automatic figurative language use detection. We propose a framework for figurative language detection based on the idea of sense differentiation. Then, we de-scribe two algorithms illustrating the mentioned idea. One of them is intended to decide whether a usage is literal by comparing the texts related to the target expression and the set of texts related to the context itself. The other is aimed at group-ing instances into literal and non-literal uses and is based on DBSCAN clustering (Ester et al, 1996). We illustrate then how these algorithms work by applying them to Russian language data. Finally, we propose some ideas on modifications which can significantly improve the accuracy of the al-gorithms. Sporleder and Li (April 2009) proposed an unsu-pervised method for recognition of literal and non-literal use of idiomatic expressions. Given an id-iom the method detects the presence or absence of cohesive links between the words the idiom con-sists of and the surrounding text. When such links exist, the occurence is considered as a literal us-age and as a non-literal when there are no such links. For most idioms the experiments showed an accuracy above 50% (it varies between 11% and 98% for different idioms). The authors then pro-posed an improvement of the algorithm (Li and Sporleder, August 2009) by adding the Support Vector Machine classifier as a second stage. They use the mentioned above unsupervised algorithm to label the training data for the supervised classi-fier. The average accuracy of the improved algo-rithm is about 90%. Our approach is also based on the idea of the relatedness between the expres-sion and the surrounding context. Unlike the men-tioned study, we do not focus our attention only on idioms. So far we have mostly dealt with ex-pressions, which are not necessarily idiomatic by themselves, but become metaphors in a particular context (e.g.  X  X he is the sunshine  X ,  X  X ife is a jour-ney  X ) and expressions that are invented by an au-thor (e.g.  X  my heart X  X  in the Highlands  X ). More-over, the improved algorithm (Li and Sporleder, August 2009) is supervised, and our approach is unsupervised.

The study by Katz and Giesbrecht (2006) is also supervised, unlike ours. It also considers multi-word expressions that have idiomatic meanings. They propose an algorithm, which computes the vectors for literal and non-literal usages and then use the nearest neighbor classifier to label an un-seen occurence of the given idiom.
 The approach proposed by Birke and Sarkar (2006) is nearly unsupervised. They constructed two seed sets: one consists of literal usages of different expressions and the other consists of non-literal usages. They calculate the distance between an occurence in question and these two sets and assign to the occurence the label of the closest set. This work, as well as ours, refers to the ideas from Word Sense Disambiguation area. Unlike our approach, the authors focus their attention only on the detection of figuratevely used verbs and, whereas we only refer to the concepts and ideas of WSD, they adapt a particular existing one-word disambiguation method.

As we have already said, we deal with dif-ferent types of figurative language (metaphors, metonymies etc.). However, there are some works aimed at extracting particular types of figura-tive language. For example, Nissim and Mark-ert (2003) proposed a machine learning algorithm for metonymy resolution. They state the problem of metonymy resolution as a classification task be-tween literal use of a word and a number of prede-fined metonymy types. We could treat a figurative meaning of a word as an additional, not common meaning of this word. Actually, some metaphors are quite common (e.g. eye of a needle , leg of a table , etc.) and are called catachretic metaphors. They appear in a language to remedy the gap in vocabulary (Black, 1954). These metaphors do not indicate an author X  X  writ-ing style: an author uses such metaphor for an ob-ject because the language has no other name for that object. Therefore the algorithms we are de-veloping do not work with this type of metaphors.
Our approach to figurative language detection is based on the following idea: the fact that the sense of a word significantly differs from the sense of the surrounding text usually indicates that the word is used figuratively. Two questions arise im-mediately: 1. How do we represent the sense of both the 2. How do we find out that these senses differ
To answer the first question, we refer to the ideas popular in the Word Sense Disambiguation community: sense is a group of contextually simi-lar occurrences of a word (Sch  X  utze, 1996). Hence, we represent the senses of both a word and its con-text as sets of documents related to the word and the context respectively. These sets can be ob-tained e.g. by searching Wikipedia, Google or an-other web search engine. For a word the query can be the word itself. As for a text, this query can be formulated as the whole text or as a set of some words contained in this text. It seems to us that querying the lexical chains (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) extracted from the text should provide bet-ter results than querying the whole text.

As soon as we have a sense representation for such objects as a word and a text, we should find a way to measure the difference between these sense representations and find out what difference is strong enough for the considered occurence to be classified as a non-literal usage. One way to do this is representing sets of documents as sets of vectors and measuring the distance between the centers of the obtained vector sets. Another way is to apply clustering techniques to the sets and to measure the accuracy of the produced clustering. The higher the accuracy is, the more different the sets are.

Besides, this can be done by calculating text-to-text semantic similarity using for example the measure proposed by Mihalcea et al (2006). This is rather difficult in case of the Russian language because at the moment there is no WordNet-like taxonomies for Russian.

In the next section, we propose two algorithms based on the mentioned above idea. We state the algorithms generally and try to find out experi-mentally what combination of the described tech-niques provides the best results. The algorithm is intended to determine whether a word (or an expression) in a given context is used literaly or not.

As it was mentioned above, we decided to rep-resent senses of both an expression and a context as sets of documents. Our hypothesis is that these document sets differ significantly if and only if an expression is used figuratevely. Thus, the al-gorithm decides whether the occurence is literal by comparing two sets of documents: the typical context set , which represents a sense of the expres-sion, and the related context set , which represents a sense of the context. A naive way to construct the typical context set is searching some searching engine (e.g. Google) for the expression. Given a context with a target expression, the related con-text set can be constructed as follows: 1. Remove the target expression from the con-2. Extract the longest lexical chains from the re-3. For every chain put to the set the first N arti-
After constructing the sets the algorithm should estimate the similarity between these two sets. This, for example, can be done by applying any clustering algorithm to the data and measuring the accuracy. Evidently, the higher the accuracy of the obtained clustering is, the more separated the sets are. It means that, when the usage is literal, the accuracy should be lower because we try to make two clusters out of data that should appear as the only cluster.

We hypothesize that in case of non-literal us-ages these two sets should be significantly sepa-rated.

Our experiments include two stages. During the first one we test our idea and estimate the param-eters of the algorithms. During the second stage we test the more precise algorithm obtained dur-ing the first stage.

For the first stage, we found literal and non-literal occurences of the following Russian words and expressions:  X  X  X  X  X  (snowstorm),  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (breath),  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (dagger),  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (dance),  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (flexible (flower) stalk),  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (be drowned),  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (crystal),  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (bagpipes),  X  X  X  (honey),  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (medicine).
 For every expression, the typical context set con-sists of the first 10 articles retrieved by searching Google for the expression. In order to construct the second set we removed the target expression from the context and manually extracted lexical chains from the texts, although, the process of lex-ical chains extraction can be done automatically. However the algorithms on lexical chains extrac-tion usually use WordNet to calculate the related-ness, but as it was already mentioned WordNet for the Russian language does not exist yet. An-other way to calculate semantic relatedness is us-ing Wikipedia (Mihalcea, 2007; Turdakov and Ve-likhov, 2008), but it takes much effort. The sec-ond set for each occurence consists of the first 10 articles retrieved by searching Google for the ex-tracted chains. Then we applied k-means cluster-ing algorithm ( k = 2 ) to these sets. To evaluate the clustering we used measures from the clustering literature. We denote our sets by G = g 1 , g 2 and the clusters obtained by k-means as C = c 1 , c 2 . We define a mapping f from the elements of G to the elements of C , such that each set g i is mapped to a cluster c j = f ( g i ) that has the highest per-centage of common elements with g i . Precision and recall for a cluster g i , i = 1 , 2 are defined as follows:
Pr i =
Precision, Pr , and recall, Re , of the clustering are defined as the weighted averages of the preci-sion and recall values over the sets:
Pr =
F 1 -measure is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, i.e.,
Table 1 shows the results of the clustering. For 9 expressions out of 10, the clustering accuracy is higher in case of a metaphorical usage than in case of a literal one. Moreover, for 9 out of 10
Table 1: Results provided by k-means clustering metaphorical usages, F-measure is 0,85 or higher. And for 7 out of 10 literal usages, F-measure is 0,75 or less.

The first stage of the experiments illustrates the idea of sense differentiation. Based on the ob-tained results, we have concluded, that F-measure value equal to 0,85 or higher indicates a figurative usage, and the value equal to 0,75 or less indicates a literal usage.

At the second stage, we applied the algorithm to several Russian language expressions used lit-erally or figuratively. The accuracy of the k-means clustering is shown in Table 2.
 Table 2: Testing the algorithm. Accuracy of the k-means clustering
For 75% of metaphorical usages F-measure is 0,85 or more as was expected and for 50% of lit-eral usages F-measure is 0,75 or less. The described above approach is to decide whether a word in a context is used literally or not. Unlike the first one, the second approach we pro-pose, deals with a set of occurences of a word as to label every occurence as  X  X iteral X  or  X  X on-literal X . We formulate this task as a clustering problem and apply DBSCAN (Ester et al, 1996) clustering al-gorithm to the data. Miller and Charles (1991) hy-pothesized that words with similar meanings are often used in similar contexts. As it was men-tioned, we can treat a meaning of a metaphoric usage of an expression as an additional, not com-mon for the expression. That X  X  why we expect metaphorical usages to be ouliers, while clustering together with common (i.e. literal) usages. Theo-retically, the algorithm should also distinguish be-tween all literal senses so that the contexts of the same meaning appear in the same cluster and the contexts of different meanings -in different clus-ters. Therefore, ideally, the algorithm should solve word sense discrimination and non-literal usages detection tasks simultaneously.

For each Russian word shown in Table 3, we extracted from the Russian National Cor-pora ( http://ruscorpora.ru/ ) several lit-eral and non-literal occurences. Some of these words have more than one meaning in Russian, e.g.  X  X  X  X  can be translated as a key or water spring and the word  X  X  X  X  as a plait , scythe or spit .
All the documents are stemmed and all stop-words are removed with the SnowBall Stem-mer ( http://snowball.tartarus.org/ ) for the Russian language.

As it was mentioned above, this algorithm is aimed at providing word sense discrimination and non-literal usages detection simultaneously. So far we have paid attention only to the non-literal usages detection aspects. DBSCAN algorithm is a density-based clustering algorithm designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. This algo-rithm requires two parameters:  X  (eps) and the minimum number of points in a cluster (minPts).
We set minPts to 3 and run the algorithm for different eps between 1.45 and 1.55.

As was mentioned, so far we have considered only figurative language detection issues: The al-gorithm marks an instance as a figurative usage iff the instance is labeled as an outlier. Thus, we mea-sure the accuracy of the algorithm as follows: precision = Figures 1 and 2 show the dependency between the eps parameter and the algorithm X  X  accuracy for different words.
 Figure 1: Dependency between eps and F-measure Figure 2: Dependency between eps and F-measure
Table 4 shows  X  X he best X  eps for each word and the corresponding accuracies of metaphor detec-tion Table 4: The best eps parameters and correspond-ing accuracies of the algorithm So far we have worked only with tf-idf and word frequency model for both algorithms. The next step in our study is utilizing different text repre-sentation models, e.g. second order context vec-tors. We are also going to develop an efficient parameter estimation procedure for the algorithm based on DBSCAN clustering.

As for the other algorithm, we are going to dis-tinguish between different figurative language ex-pressions:  X  one word expressions  X  multiword expressions
We expect the basic algorithm to provide dif-ferent accuracy in case of different types of ex-pressions. Dealing with multiword expressions and monosemous words should be easier than with polysemous words: i.e., for monosemous word we expect the second set to appear as one cluster, whereas this set for a polysemous word is expected to have the number of clusters equal to the number of senses it has.

Another direction of the future work is develop-ing an algorithm for figurative language uses ex-traction . The algorithm has to find figuratively used expressions in a text. In this paper, we have proposed a framework for figurative language detection based on the idea of sense differentiation. We have illustrated how this idea works by presenting two clustering-based al-gorithms. The first algorithm deals with only one context. It is based on comparing two context sets: one is related to the expression and the other is se-mantically related to the given context. The sec-ond algorithm groups the given contexts in literal and non-literal usages. This algorithm should also distinguish between different senses of a word, but we have not yet paid enough attention to this as-pect. By applying these algorithms to small data sets we have illustrated how the idea of sense dif-ferentiation works. These algorithms show quite good results and are worth further work.
