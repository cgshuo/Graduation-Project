 Linlin Ma 1 , Guanfeng Liu 1 , Guohao Sun 1 ,LeiLi 2 , Zhixu Li 1 ,AnLiu 1 , and Lei Zhao 1 Online Social Networks (OSNs) have been used as a means for a variety of activi-ties, like employment, movie recommendatio n and e-commerce, etc. A Contextual OSN (COSN) [1] can be modeled as a graph depicted in Fig. 1, where each node represents a participant and each link corresponds to the r eal-world interactions or online interac-tions between them. In addition to the social network structure, the COSN also contains social contexts including social trust, soci al intimacy degree betw een participants and role impact factor of participants denoted as T , r and  X  , as shown in Fig. 1. Selecting the trust paths that can yield the most trustworthy trust evaluation results based on the preferences of users can be modelled as an classical NP-Complete multi-constrained optimal path selection problem [2].

This tool provides three types of social paths for supporting users decision making, i.e., (1) the shortest path between a pair of source and target, (2) the path with the max-imum T value based on the method proposed in [3], and (3) the multiple constrained K optimal social paths based on our efficient and effective approximation algorithm, D-MCBA proposed in [1], which considers user X  X  preference and social context in trust paths selection. Our MTP selection tool can help establish reasonable trust relation-ships between unknown participants, which can be a backbone in many OSN based applications.For example, it can help an em ployer find potential trustworthy employees in OSNs, help a retailer find trustworthy loyal customers in an OSN based CRM system, and help find reliable workers in OSN based crowdsourcing platforms.
 Our tool is based on Struts and Hibernate, the server runtime environment is Tomcat 7 and JDK 7. The social network is stored by MySQL database and the social net-work display is developed by using mxGraph 1 , a Javascript library for graph drawing. Fig. 2 shows the architecture of our tool. The MTP selection tool can divided into two components: (1) Source-Target selection component (Fig. 3), and (2) paths selection component (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Our MTP selec tion tool can be accessed via the web link http://mtp.cnzhujie.cn/ ( compatible with Google Chrome ). 2.1 Source-Target Selection Component The Source-Target selection component displays the social network when loading the tool as shown in Fig. 3. The red and big nodes have larger indegree than that of the purple and small ones. We name the red nodes as Popular Nodes and the purple nodes as General Nodes . When an user move the mouse on a node in the social network, he/she can view the brief information of the participant. When an user selects a node from the displayed social network structure, the corresponding participant X  X  head image will be added into the node selection component on the left. 2.2 Paths Selection Component The paths selection component is divided into two areas, the parameter input area on the left of MTP selection tool (see Fig. 4) and the result display area on the right (see Figure 5). The top of the parameter input area is for users to set the simulation times of the Monte Carlo interation [4] and the end-to-end constraints for T , r and  X  in the scope of [0,1] as the requirements for the K optimal trust paths selection. Then, users can set T , r and  X  weights in the scope of [0,1], and the sum of them equals to 1. In addition, the middle of the parameter input area is to (1) help filter those nodes with small indegree and outdegree, and (2) control the maximal length of the selected social trust paths. Furthermore, at the bottom of the parameter input area, there is a checkbox list for users to determine which type of paths they would like to select and display. The result of paths selection can be viewed in paths selection result display area as shown in Fig. 6, where three types of paths between a source (ID=14) and the target (ID=34) are displayed, and the T and r values between participants are displayed on edges, and the  X  values of participants are displayed on the top of the head images. After opening our MTP selection tool, the social network structure can be displayed in the social network display area. Then an user could select a source and a target by clicking the nodes from the structure. The corresponding head images of the selected nodes will be displayed in the node selection area. Then the user can input parameter values to select social trust paths based on his /her preferences. After clicking the button to submit the parameters, the trust path selection results will be displayed in the path display area. Fig. 5 shows the three types of paths between a source (ID=14) and the target (ID=34). In this paper, we introduce a tool to select multiple trust paths in Contextual Online Social Networks (COSNs). By using our MTP selection tool, an user can evaluate the trustworthiness of other unknown participants, which can be used in many OSN based applications, like finding potential trustworthy employees in OSNs, finding trustworthy loyal customers for a retailer in CRM systems, and finding reliable workers in OSN based crowdsourcing platforms.
