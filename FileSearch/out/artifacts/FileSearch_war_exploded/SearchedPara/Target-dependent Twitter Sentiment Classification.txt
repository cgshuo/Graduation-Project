 Twitter, as a micro -blogging system, allows users to publish tweets of up to 140 characters in length to tell others what they are doing, what they are thinking, or what is happening around them. Over the past few years, Twitter has becom e very pop u-lar. According to the latest Twitter entry in Wi k-ipedia, the number of Twitter users has climbed to 190 million and the number of tweets published on Twitter every day is over 65 million 1 . 
As a result of the rapidly increasing number of tweets, mining people X  X  sentiments expressed in tweets has attracted more and more attention. In fact, there are already many web sites built on the Internet providing a Twitter sentiment search se r-vice, such as Tweetfeel 2 , Twendz 3 , and Twitter Sentiment 4 . In tho se web sites, the user can input a sentiment target as a query, and search for tweets containing positive or negative sentiments towards the target. The problem needing to be addressed can be formally named as Target -dependent Se n-timent Classification of T weets ; namely, given a query, classifying the sentiment s of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sent i-ments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments.

The state -of -the -art approaches for solving this problem, such as (Go et al., 2009 5 ; Barbosa and Feng, 2010), basically fo l low (Pang et al., 2002) , who utilize machine lear n ing based classifiers for the sentiment classification of texts. However, the ir classif iers actually work in a target -independent way: all the features used in the classifiers are i n-dependent of the target, so the sentiment is decided no matter what the target is. Since (Pang et al., 2002) (or later research on se n timent classification of pr oduct reviews) aim to classify the polarities of movie (or product) r e views and each movie (or product) review is a s sumed to express sentiments only about the target movie (or product), it is re a-sonable for them to adopt the target -independent approach. Ho wever, for target -dependent sentiment classification of tweets, it is not suitable to exactly adopt that a p proach. Because people may mention multiple targets in one tweet or comment on a ta r-get in a tweet while saying many other unrelated things in the sa me tweet, target -independent a p-proaches are likely to yield unsatisfactory results: 
In fact, it is easy to find many such cases by looking at the output of Twitter Sentiment or other Twitter sentiment analysis web sites. Based on our manual evaluation of Twitter Sentiment output, about 40% of errors are because of this (see Se c-tion 6.1 for more details). 
In addition, tweets are usually shorter and more ambiguous than other sentiment data commonly used for sentiment analysis, such as reviews and blogs. Consequently, it is more difficult to classify the sentiment of a tweet only based on its content. For instance, for the following tweet, which co n-tains only three words, it is difficult for any exis t-ing approaches to classify its se ntiment correctly.  X  First game: Lakers!  X 
However, relations between individual tweets are more common than those in other sentiment data. We can easily find many related tweets of a given tweet, such as the tweets published by the same person, the tweets r eplying to or replied by the given tweet, and retweets of the given tweet. These related tweets provide rich information about what the given tweet expresses and should definitely be taken into consideration for classif y-ing the sentiment of the given tweet .

In this paper, we propose to improve target -dependent sentiment classification of tweets by using both target -dependent and context -aware approaches. Specifically, the target -dependent a p-proach refers to incorporating syntactic features generated using w ords syntactically connected with the given target in the tweet to decide whether or not the sentiment is about the given target. For instance, in the second example, using syntactic parsing, we know that  X  Windows 7  X  is connected to  X  better  X  by a copula, w hile  X  Vista  X  is connected to  X  better  X  by a preposition. By learning from training data, we can probably predict that  X  Wi n-dows 7  X  should get a positive sentiment and  X  Vista  X  should get a negative sentiment. 
In addition, we also propose to incorporate the c ontexts of tweets into classification, which we call a context -aware approach. By considering the se n-timent labels of the related tweets, we can further boost the performance of the sentiment classific a-tion, especially for very short and ambiguous tweets. For example, in the third example we me n-tioned above, if we find that the previous and fo l-lowing tweets published by the same person are both positive about the Lakers , we can confidently classify this tweet as positive.

The remainder of this paper is stru ctured as fo l-lows. In Section 2, we briefly summarize related work. Section 3 gives an overview of our approach. We explain the target -dependent and context -aware approaches in detail in Sections 4 and 5 r e-spectively. Experimental results are reported in S ection 6 and Section 7 concludes our work . In recent years, sentiment analysis (SA) has b e-come a hot topic in the NLP research community. A lot of papers have been published on this topic. 2.1 Target -independent S A Specifically, Turney ( 2002) pro pose s an unsupe r-vised method for classifying product or movie r e-views as positive or negative. In th is method, sentimental phrases are first selected from the r e-views according to predefined part -of -speech pa t-terns. Then the semantic orientation score of e ach phrase is calculated according to the mutual info r-mation values be tween the phrase and t wo pred e-fined seed word s . Finally, a review is classified based on the average semantic orientation of the sentimental phrases in the review.

In contrast, (Pang et al., 2002) treat the sent i-ment classification of movie reviews simply as a special case of a topic -based text categorization problem and investigate three classification alg o-rithms: Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Su p-port Vector Machines. Accordi ng to th e ex perimental results, machine learning based cla s-sifiers outperform the unsupervised approach , where the best performance is achieved by the SVM classifier with unigram presences as features. 2.2 Target -dependent S A Besides the above mentioned work for targe t -independent sentiment classification, there are also several approaches proposed for target -dependent classification, such as (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Ding and Liu, 2007). (Nasuk a-wa and Yi, 2003) adopt a rule based approach, where rules are created by human s for adjectives, verbs, nouns, and so on. Given a sentiment target and its context, part -of -speech tagging and d e-pendency parsing are first performed on the co n-text. Then predefined rules are matched in the context to determine the sen timent about the target. In (Hu and Liu, 2004), opinions are extracted from product reviews, where the features of the product are considered opinion targets. The sentiment about each target in each sentence of the review is determined based on the dominan t orientation of the opinion words appearing in the sentence.

As mentioned in Section 1, target -dependent sentiment classification of review sentences is quite different from that of tweets. In reviews, if any sentiment is expressed in a sentence containin g a feature, it is very likely that the sentiment is about the feature. However, the assumption does not hold in tweets . 2.3 SA of Tweets As Twitter becomes more popular, sentiment ana l-ysis on Twitter data becomes more attractive. (Go et al., 2009; Parikh and Movassate, 2009; Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Davidiv et al., 2010) all follow the machine learning based approach for sentiment classific a tion of tweets. Specifically, (Davidiv et al., 2010) propose to classify tweets into multiple sentiment types using hashta gs and smileys as l a-bels. In their approach, a supervised KNN -like classifier is used. In contrast, (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) propose a two -step approach to classify the sentiments of tweets using SVM classifiers with abstract features. The training data is collected from the outputs of three existing Twitter sent i-ment classification web sites. As mentioned above, these approaches work in a target -independent way, and so need to be adapted for target -dependent se n-timent classific a tion. The problem we address in this paper is target -dependent sentiment classification of tweets. So the input of our task is a collection of tweets co n-taining the target and the output is labels assigned to each of the tweets. Inspired by (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Pang and Lee, 2004), we design a three -step approach in this paper: 
In each of the first two steps, a binary SVM class ifier is built to perform the classification. To train the classifiers, we use SVM -Light 6 with a linear kernel; the default setting is adopted in all experiments. 3.1 Preprocessing In our approach, rich feature representations are used to distinguish between s entiments expressed towards different targets. In order to generate such features, much NLP work has to be done befor e-hand, such as tweet normalization, POS tagging, word stemming, and syntactic parsing. 
In our experiments, POS tagging is performed by the OpenNLP POS tagger 7 . Word stemming is performed by using a word stem mapping table consisting of about 20,000 entries. We also built a simple rule -based model for tweet normalization which can correct simple spelling errors and vari a-tions into normal form , such as  X  X ooood X  to  X  X ood X  and  X  X uve X  to  X  X ove X . For syntactic parsing we use a Maximum Spanning Tree dependency parser (McDonald et al., 2005) . 3.2 Target -independent Features Previous work ( Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Davidiv et al., 2010) has discovered many effective features for sentiment analysis of tweets, such as emoticons, punctuation, prior subjectivity and polarity of a word. In our classifiers, most of these features are also used. Since these features are all generated without considering the target, we call them target -independent features. In both the subjectivity cla s-sifier and polarity classifier, the same target -independent feature set is used. Specifically, we use two kinds of target -independent features: Besides target -independent features, we also inco r-porate target -dependent features in both th e subje c-tivity classifier and polarity classifier. We will e x-plain them in detail below . 4.1 E xtended Target s It is quite common that people express their sent i-ments about a target by commenting not on the target itself but on some related things of the target. For example, one may express a sentiment about a company b y commenting on its products or tec h-nologies. To express a sentiment about a product, one may choose to comment on the features or functionalities of the product. It is assumed that readers or audiences can clearly infer the sentiment about the target base d on those sentiments about the related things. As shown in the tweet below, the author expresses a positive sentiment about  X  X  i crosoft X  by expressing a positive sentiment directly about  X  X icrosoft technologies X .  X  X  am passionate about Microsoft technologi es especially Silverlight. X 
In this paper, we define those aforementioned related things as Extended Targets. Tweets e x-pressing positive or negative sentiments towards the extended targets are also regarded as positive or negative about the target. Therefo re, for target -dependent sentiment classification of tweets, the first thing is identifying all extended targets in the input tweet collection. 
In this paper, we first regard all noun phrases , including the target , as extended targets for si m-plicity. Howe ver, it would be interesting to know under what circumstances the sentiment towards the target is truly consistent with that towards its extended targets. For example, a sentiment about someone X  X  behavior usually means a sentiment about the person, while a sentiment about som e-one X  X  colleague usually has nothing to do with the person. This could be a future work direction for target -dependent sentiment classification.

In addition to the noun phrases including the target, we further expand the extended target set with the following three methods: 4.2 Target -dependent Features Target -dependent sentiment classification needs to distinguish the expressions describing the target from other expressi ons. In this paper, we rely on the syntactic parse tree to satisfy this need. Speci f-ically, for any word stem w i in a tweet which has one of the following relations with the given target T or any from the extended target set, we generate corresponding target -dependent features with the fo l lowing rules: 
Moreover, if an y word included in the generated target -dependent fea tures is modified by a neg a-tion 9 , then we will add a prefix  X  neg - X  to it in the generated features. For example, for the target iP h-one in the tweet  X  iPhone does not work better with the CellBand  X , we wil l generate the features  X  arg1_v_neg -well  X  and  X  neg -work_it_arg1  X .
To overcome the spar s ity of target -dependent features mentioned above, we design a special b i-nary feature indicating whether or not the tweet contains at least one of the above target -depend ent features. Target -dependent features are binary fe a-tures, each of which corresponds to the presence of the feature in the tweet. If the feature is present, the entry will be 1; otherwise it will be 0 . As we mentioned in Section 1, since tweets are usually shorter and more ambiguous, it would be useful to take their contexts into consideration when classifying the sentiments. In this paper, we regard the following three kinds of related tweets as context for a tweet.
Based on these thr ee kinds of relations, we can construct a graph using the input tweet collection of a given target. As illustrated in Figure 1, each circle in the graph indicates a tweet. The three kinds of edges indicate being published by the same person ( solid line), r etweeting (dash line), and replying relations (round dotted line) respe c-tively.

If we consider that the sentiment of a tweet only depends on its content and immediate neigh bors, we can leverage a graph -based method for sent i-ment classification of tweets. Specifically, the probability of a tweet belonging to a specific se n-timent class can be computed with the following formula:
Where c is the sentiment label of a tweet which belongs to {positive, negative, neutral}, G is the tweet graph, N(d) is a specific assignment of se n-timent labels to all immediate neighbors of the tweet, and  X  is the content of the tweet.

We can convert the output scores of a tweet by the subjectivity and polarity classifiers into prob a-bilistic form and use t hem to approximate p(c|  X ) . Then a relaxation labeling algorithm describ ed in (Angelova and Weikum, 2006) can be used on the graph to iteratively estimate p(c| X ,G) f or all tweet s. After the iteration ends, for any tweet in the graph, the sentiment label that has the maximum p(c|  X ,G) is co n sidered the final label. Because there is no annotated tweet corpus publi c-ly available for evaluation of target -dependent Twitter sentiment classifi cation , we have to create our own. Since people are most interested in se n-timents towards celebrities, companies and pro d-ucts, we selected 5 popular queries of these kinds: { Obama, Google, iPad, Lakers, Lady Gaga }. For each of those quer ies, we down loaded 400 English tweets 10 containing the query using the Twitter API. 
W e manually classify each tweet as positive, negative or neutral towards the query with which it is downloaded. After removing duplicate tweets, we finally obtain 459 posit ive, 268 negative and 1 , 212 neutral tweets.

Among the tweets, 100 are labeled by two h u-man annotators for inter -annotator study. T he r e-sult s show that for 86% of them , both annotators g a ve identical labels. Among the 14 tweets which the two annotators disa gree on, only 1 case is a positive -negative disagreement (one annotator co n-siders it positive while the other negative), and the other 13 are all neutral -subjective disagreement. This probably indicates that it is harder for human s to decide if a tweet is neutral or subjective than to decide if it is positive or negative . 6.1 Error Analysis of Twitter Sentiment Ou t-We first analyze the output of Twitter Sentiment (TS) using the five test queries. For each query, we randomly select 20 tweets labeled as positi ve or negative by TS . We also manually classify each tweet as posit ive, negative or neutral about the co r-responding query . Then, w e analyze those tweets that get different labels from T S and hu man s . F i-nally we find two major types of error: 1) Tweets which are totally neutral (for any target) are class i-fied as subjective by TS ; 2) sentiments in some tweets are classified correctly but the sentiments are not tr u ly about the query. The two types take up about 35% and 40% of the total errors, respe c-tively. 
Th e second type is actually what we want to r e-solve in this paper. A fter further checking those tweets of the second type, we found that most of them are actually neutral for the target , which means th at the dominant error in Twitter Sentiment is classif y in g neutral tweets as subjective. Below are several examples of the second type where the bolded words are the targets . celtics X  (negative by TS but positive by human)  X  why am i getting spams from weird people as k-ing me if i want to chat with lady gaga  X  (positive by TS but neutral by human)  X  Bringing iPhone and iPad apps into cars? http://www.speakwithme.com/ will be out soon and alpha is awesome in my car. X  (positive by TS but neutral by human)  X  Here's a great art icle about Monte Veronese cheese. It's in Italian so just put the url into Google translate and enjoy http://ow.ly/3oQ77 X  (positive by TS but neutral by human) 6.2 Evaluation of Subjectivity Classification We conduct several experiments to evaluate su b-jectivit y classifiers using different features . In the experiments, we consider the positive and negative tweets annotated by humans as subjective tweets (i.e., positive instances in the SVM classifiers), which amount to 727 tweets. Followi ng (Pang et al., 2002), we balance the evaluation data set by randomly selecting 727 tweets from all neutral tweets annotated by human s and consider them as objective tweets (i.e., negative instances in the classifiers). We perform 10 -fold cross -validations on the selected data. Following (Go et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2002), we use accuracy as a metric in our experiments. The results are listed below.
As shown in Table 1, the classifier using only the content features achieves an accuracy of 61. 1 %. Adding sentiment lexicon features improves the accuracy to 63.8%. Fi nally, the best performance (68. 2 %) is achieved by combining target -dependent features and other fe a tures ( t -test: p &lt; 0.005) . This clearly show s that target -dependent features do help remove many sent i ments not truly about the target. We also re -implement ed the method proposed in (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) for comparison. From Table 1, we can see that all our systems pe r form better than (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) on our data set . One possible reason is that (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) use only abstract fe a-tures w hile our systems use more lexical features .
To further evaluate the contribution of target e x-tension, we compare the system using the exact target and all extended targets with that using o n ly the exact target. We also eliminate the extended targets genera ted by each of the three target exte n-sion methods and reevaluate the performances.

As shown in Table 2, without extended tar gets, the accuracy is 65. 6 % , which is still higher than those using only target -independent features . After adding all extended targets, the accuracy is i m-proved significantly to 68. 2 % ( p &lt; 0.005), which suggests that target extension does help find ind i-rectly expressed sentiments about the target. In addition, all of the three methods contribute to the overall improvement, with the head noun method contributing most. However, the other two met h-ods do not contribute significantly. 6.3 Evaluation of Polarity Classification Similarly, we conduct several experiments on pos i-tive and negative tweets to compare the polarity classifiers with different feature s , where we use 268 negative and 268 randomly selec ted positive tweets. The results are listed below.

From Table 3, we can see that the classifier u s-ing only the content features achieves the worst accuracy (78. 8 %). S entiment lexicon features are shown to be very helpful for improving the pe r-formance. Similarly, we re -implemented the met h-od propo sed by (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) in this experiment. The results show that our system u s ing both content features and sentiment lexicon fe a-tures performs slightly better than (Ba r bosa and Feng, 2010) . T he reason may be same as that we explained above.

Again , the classifier using all features achieves the best performance. Both the classifiers with all features and with the combination of co n tent and sentiment lexicon features are significan t ly better than that with only the content features (p &lt; 0.01) . Howev er, the classifier with all features does not significantly outperform th at using the combin a-tion of content and sentiment lexicon fe a tures. W e also note that t he improvement by target -dependent features here is not as large as that in subjectivity classif ication . Both of these indicate that target -dependent features are more useful for improving subjectivity classification than for polarity classif i-cation. This is consistent with our o b servation in Subsection 6.2 that most errors caused by incorrect target association are mad e in subjectivity classif i-cation. We also note that all numbers in Table 3 are much bigger than those in Table 1, which su g-gest s that subjectivity classification of tweets is more difficult than polarity classific a tion.
Similarly, we ev aluate d the contribution of ta r-get extension for polarity classification . According to the results , adding all extended targets improves the accuracy by about 1 point. However, the co n-tributions from the three individual methods are not statistically signi ficant . 6.4 Evaluation of Graph -b a s e d Optimiza tion As seen in Figure 1, there are several tweets which are not connected with any other tweets. For these tweets, our graph -based optimization approach will have no effect. The following table shows the pe r-centa ges of the tweets in our evaluation data set which have at least one related tweet according to various relation types. P ublished by the same person 11 41.6
According to Table 4 , for 66. 2 % of the tweets concerning the test queries, we can find at least one related tweet. That means our context -aware a p-proach is potentially useful for most of t he tweets.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our context -aware approach, we compared the systems with and without considering the context. 
As shown in Table 5 , the overall accuracy of the target -dependent classifiers over three classes is 66. 0 %. The graph -based o ptimization improves the perfor mance by o ver 2 points (p &lt; 0.005) , which clearly shows that the context information is very useful for classifying the sentiments of tweets. From the detailed improvement for each sentiment class, we find that the context -aware approach is especially helpful for po sitive and negative classes. P ublished by the same person 67.8
We further compared the three types of relations for context -aware sentiment classi fication; the r e-sults are reported in Table 6 . Clearly, being pu b-lished by the same person is the most useful relation for sentiment classification, which is co n-sistent with the percentage distribution of the tweets over relation types ; using retweet only does not help. One possible reason for this is that the retweets and their original tweets are nearly the same, so it is very likely that they have already got the sam e labels in previous classifi cation s. Twitter sentiment analy sis has attracted much a t-tention recently. In this paper, we address target -dependent sentiment classification of tweets. Di f-ferent from previous work using target -independent classification, we propose to incorp o-rate syntactic features to distinguish text s used for expressing sentiments towards different targets in a tweet. According to the experimental results, the classifiers incorporating target -dependent features significantly outperform the previous target -independent classifiers. 
In addition, differ ent from previous work using only information on the current tweet for sentiment classification, we propose to take the related tweets of the current tweet into consideration by utilizing graph -based optimization. According to the expe r-imental results, the graph -based optimization si g-nificantly improves the performance.

As mentioned in Section 4.1, in future we would like to explore the relations between a target and any of its extended targets. We are also interested in exploring relations between Twitter accounts for classifying the sentiments of the tweets published by them.
