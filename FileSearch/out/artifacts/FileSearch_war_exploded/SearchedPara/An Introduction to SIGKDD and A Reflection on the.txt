 We live in t he age of Big Data -the Second major revolution in modern civilization after the Industrial revolution: the Information Revolution. Big data is used to improve sales, reduce customer attrition, recommend movies, music, and people, reduce fraud, predict c rime, find new drugs, develop personalized medicine, understand climate change, and many other applications.
 SIGKDD , as the main professional association for data mining and knowledge discovery (also called predictive analytics and data science) is on the leading edge of this revolution. KDD-2012 in Beijing will feature the latest research and applications in the field. SIGKDD started with workshops on Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD) organized by Gregory Piatetsky -Shapiro in 1989. These workshops grew into the International KDD conference in 1995 organized by Usama Fayy ad and Ramasamy Uthurusamy. In 1998 we formed the SIGKDD organization as part of ACM, the largest international association in computing with over 120,000 members. KDD-2012 is the 18 th Annual International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Minin g. The primary focus of SIGKDD is to provide the premier forum for advancement and adoption of the "science" of knowledge discovery and data mining. SIGKDD main activity is to organize KDD, the leading conference on data mining and knowledge discovery , held since 1995. KDD conference is top -ranked in Data Mining, according to Microsoft Research Asia. KDD -2011 was held in San Diego, CA, USA was th e largest data -mining meeting in the world, with over 1,100 participants from around the world. SIGKDD also organizes the annual KDD Cup since 1997. KDD Cup covered many topics, including direct marketing , retail data analysis, network intrusion detection, clickstream data analysis, social network analysis, text mining, recommendations, medical image analysis, and student evaluation. The success of KDD Cup competition inspired many other competitions such as the $1M Netflix Prize and the $3M Heritage Health Prize, and led to the rise of many other analytics/data mining competitions today as well as competition -based businesses like Kaggle.
 The KDD Conferences have historically been the highest quality and most selective conferences in the fields of KDD, analytics, and data mining. As an example, KDD -2011 attracted over 714 paper submissions. Of these, a total of 126 papers were accepted. These include full research papers (extremely difficult to get accepted) and poster presentation papers. In addi tion, KDD conference has an Industry/Government Applications Track (requires submitting a full peer reviewed paper for presentation) and an Industry Practice Expo (which consists of special invited talks by practitioners in the industry who have deployed serious/high impact applications of KDD). We look forward to holding KDD -2012 in Beijing, China and we hope that it will set new records of attendance, new heights of quality, and that it will continue to contribute to the advancement of the science and practice of predictive analytics, data science, Big Data, and Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases.
 Q. How is the term Data Mining adopted? The term "data mining" appeared in 1960s as derogatory term used to describe sear ch for correlations without an A priori hypothesis. It was also called "data dredging". Then around 1980s a term "database mining" has appeared . Gregory Piatetsky -Shapiro came up with the term "knowledge discovery" in 1989 for the first workshop on "Knowledge Discovery in Data ", but most press liked the term "data mining" better. This is because people realized that they have more data than time, energy, or human ability to form hypothesis. As the data grew bigger in volume and dimensionality, the term data mining became an a ccurate description of what organizations are doing: extracting value from data despite the fact that the traditional old methods did not scale and were not sufficiently computationally oriented. While the statistics community continued to reject the term "Data Mining" -For example, Daryl Pregibon (statistician at Bell Labs, now at Google) and Usama Fayyad went to Joint Statistical Meeting in Anaheim, California in 1997. And we held a session on Data Mining to wake up the Statistics community. Despite ever yone being against it in theory, our session attracted hundreds of Statisticians with many standing outside in hallways to listen and learn. Eventually, the Statistics community came around 5-6 years later, instigated by the biggest providers: SAS and SPSS adopting data mining and producing data mining products that were marketed as Data Mining. That brought eventual acceptance.
 The term extended to Text Mining, Image Mining, etc. Google itself talked a lot about text mining and Web Mining. The term now is standard. Data Mining in my opinion includes: text mining, image mining, web mining, predictive analytics, and much of the techniques we use for dealing with massive data sets, now known as Big Data. Around 2006, when Goo gle introduced Google Analytics , the term "analytics" became more popular than "data mining". The hot term of 2011 is "data science". However, whatever the name, the essence of the field is finding new and useful knowledge in data.
