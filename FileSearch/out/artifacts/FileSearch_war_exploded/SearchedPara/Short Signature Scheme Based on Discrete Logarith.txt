 Short digital signatures are needed in low-bandwidth communication and low-storage and less computation environments. For exam ple, short signatures are needed when digital signatures are also needed where a human is as ked to manually key in signature provided on a CD label. 
With the popularizing of Internet and E-commerce, it has been attractive to construct a digital signature scheme with both shorter signature length and less computation. 
A number of short signature schemes have been proposed so far. Some proposals tried to shorten RSA based signatures. Other proposals showed how to shorten the discrete-log based signature schemes while preserving the same level of security. Naccache and stern [1] proposed a variant of DSA to sign on postcard, where the signature length is approximately 240 bits. The technique proposed for reducing the DSA signature length is signatures with message recovery. In such systems, one encodes a part of the message into signatures, thus shortening the total length of the message-signature pair. For long messages, one can then achieve a DSA signature overhead of length 160 bits. However, for very short message (e. g., 64 bits) the total length is still 320 bits. Moreover, when messages are not transmitted, DSA signatures with message recovery are not any shorter than standard DSA signatures. 
The shortest signature known in the classical cryptography is based on Weil pairing and achieves 160 bits with the security level of 2 introduced a short signature scheme (BLS) from the Weil pairing based the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption on certain elliptic curves and hyper-where signatures are almost as short as BLS signature scheme without random oracle model under a strong Diffie-Hellman problem assumption. Zhang et al. [4] improved BLS scheme by replacing special hash functions by general cryptography hash functions such as SHA-1 [5] or MD5. However, the evaluation of bilinear pairings used by pairing based short signature schemes is more time-consuming. They are not as efficient as DSA type signature schemes in terms of computation. Hence the computation efficiency. 
Besides the signature length of discrete-log signature schemes, other problem is the loose security related to the underlying hard computational problem. Some discrete-log based signature schemes, such as ElGamal and DSA, require non-standard security assumptions. Other schemes, such as Schnorr signature, the  X  X odified ElGamal X  signature of Pointcheval and Stern [6], and some DSA variants, have security proofs that are only loosely related to discrete-log problems. The only known reduction converting a forging algorithm for a discrete-log signature scheme into an algorithm that breaks the underlying discrete-log problem is the  X  X orking lemma X . However, this reduction is inefficient to solve the discrete-log problem with a probability comparable to the success probability of the signature forger. Goh and Jarecki [7] proposed a signature scheme whose security is tightly related to the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in random oracle model. Though the hardness of the CDH is widely believed to be closely the former. 
In this paper, we would like to propos e a new short signature scheme SDL based on discrete-log. The main advantage of this signature scheme over DSA signature schemes is a one fourth reduction in the signature length, as well as in the logarithms, by providing an efficient reductionist security proof for existential unforgeability under adaptive chosen-message attacks in random oracle model, new scheme is needed in low-bandwidth communication, low-storage and less computation environments. order q . Let H and F be (ideal) hash functions where a  X  X   X  R S means that a is picked uniformly at random from a set S. We now describe the SDL signature scheme in full detail.  X  = ( h , s ) produced by the signing algorithm Sign is always valid . elliptic curves. only depends on  X  1 , the message m , and h . 
By directly following the technique of Pointcheval and Stern, we can obtain the generic result: machine whose input only consists of public data. We denote respectively by Q and R the number of queries that A can ask to the random oracle and the number of queries  X  ) can be simulated without knowing the secret key, with an indistinguishable machine obtained from A replacing interaction with the signer by simulation and F ( m ))  X  ( H X  ( m ,  X  1 ), F ( m )) in expected time T  X   X  120686 T /  X  . In the notation of our scheme, we obtain two equations: From them, we can compute the secret value x = ( s  X  s  X )/( H  X ( m , r )  X  H ( m , r )). 
However, the reductionist algorithm by the Forking Lemma is not efficient, so that the relation between the security of the short signature scheme SDL and the hardness of the DL problem is loose. t )/( H ( m , r ). Thus, the oracle replay attack is no longer required. hardness of the DL problem is provided by the following theorem: q , q si g  X  ) -secure against existential forgery on adaptive chosen message attack in the random oracle model, where t X   X  (3/2)( t + (2 q s + q F ) C exp ( G g,p ))  X  Here C exp ( G g,p ) denotes the computation of a long exponentiation in the group G g,p . For the reason of page limits, the proof is written in the full paper version. The Security of the Hash Functions: To obtain a short signature, we let q be 160 bits. discrete logarithms. We have provide a close reductionist security proof for existential unforgeability under adaptive chosen-message attacks in random oracle model, practice, the hash function H and F are not really random. Thus the security proof in guarantee security against an adversary who does not exploit any property whatsoever of the hash functions H and F . 
The contribution of the short signature scheme over DSS is a one fourth reduction computation time of the exponentiation is proportional to the bit size of the exponent. The new scheme is more suitable for low-bandwidth communication, low-storage and less computation environments, and is particularly suited for smart card, PDA and mobile phone. 
Recently, Biham and Chen [10] found two near-collisions of the full compression function of SHA-0 and millions of collision of reduced variant of SHA-1. Wang and her colleagues further broke full SHA-1 by using 2 of hash functions which are indispensable in signature schemes. To guarantee security, we should use longer hash functions, such as SHA-256, SHA-512, which lengthen the signatures of DSA, Schnorr and BSL et al. schemes and increase the computation load of these signature schemes. However, the proposed short signature scheme SDL maintains the status quo since it does suffer from these problems. Therefore our SDL signature scheme is advantageous over the extended DSA, Schnorr and BSL et al. schemes in future.
