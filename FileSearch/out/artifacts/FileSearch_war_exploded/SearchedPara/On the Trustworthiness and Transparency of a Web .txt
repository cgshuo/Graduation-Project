 Web search sites comprise search engines and strategies of representing SERPs (search engine result pages), wherein SERP implies the listing of Web pages returned by a search engine in response to a keyword query. Usually, the earlier a Web site or a Web page is presented in the SERP, or the higher it ranks, the more searchers visit corner of a screen when a Google X  X  SERP is displayed; this part of the Web page is called as the  X  X olden Triangle. X  It shows that a Web site cannot maintain the visual ness organization intends to advertise commercial products effectively or if a political organization launches a strong campaign on the Web, it becomes very important for their Web sites to be ranked within the top seven of the SERP in response to the intended search keywords. Under such a situation, the trustworthiness of Web search sites emerges as one of the most contentious but important issues to be investigated. In this paper, we pay special attention to a search keyword  X  X ender-equal X  to check the trustworthiness of SERPs when the keyword is typed. This keyword was adopted because it acquired a strong political coloration under the environment in which the Japanese Cabinet Office began to revise the Basic Plan for Gender Equality in 2005 to formulate the Second Basic Plan for Gender Equality (next five-year plan). A conflict between the gender-bashing sects and gender advocates appeared to be a war on the Web, where the gender-bashing sects were keen to advertise the danger of gender equal education in elementary and secondar y schools. Note that this advertisement has some degree of sympathy because the translation of  X  X ender-equal X  into a Japa-nese-English word  X  X ender-free X  often evokes promiscuity among adolescents. By the trustworthiness of a SERP or Web search site, we imply that the display order of Web pages presented in a SERP returned by a Web search engine in response to a search keyword is true, correct, or reliable. To analyze the trustworthiness of a SERP returned by Google, we performed the following observation steps: (a) Check a SERP returned by Google in response to  X  X ender-equal X  as a search (b) Check the SERPs returned by Google X  X  six partner search sites (at that point in (c) Check a SERP returned by Yahoo!Japan in response to the same. (d) Compare the above SERPs from various viewpoints, including ranking. Yahoo!Japan was taken into consideration because it used its own search engine called Yahoo! Search Technology (YST). The top fifteen pages of each SERP were compared and taken into consideration. thiness. To analyze the transparency of a SERP returned by Google, (hereafter, the transparency of Google), we examined the PageRank TM and the number of backlinks for each Web page in a SERP returned by Google and Yahoo!Japan. Moreover, we exam-ined the number of times the keywords appeared on a landing page. These statistics were obtained using reproducible tools such as Google PageRank Checker to obtain PageR-ank TM , Yahoo! Site Explorer (http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/) to specifically ex-plore the number of backlinks of the Web pages indexed by Yahoo! Search, and a key-word appearance frequency analysis tool (http://www.searchengineoptimization.jp/tools/ keyword_density_analyzer.html) to determine the number of times a keyword appeared on a page. In order to obtain further data on the number of backlinks, we used a Web tool named Link Popularity Check (http://www.uptimebot.com/). 3.1 An Overview of Analysis Result The SERPs returned by Google, Google X  X  six partner sites and Yahoo!Japan, in re-sponse to the same search keyword gender-equal in Japanese were recorded on Janu-ary 7, 2006, immediately after the war of words between the gender-bashing sects and gender advocates had concluded, i.e., the Cabi net Office X  X  final decision to revise the Basic Plan for Gender Equality to formulate the Second Basic Plan for Gender Equal-ity (next five-year plan) was completed on December 27, 2005. Table 1 presents an overall analysis result. It comprises twenty-five columns. The center part of Table 1 illustrates the SERP of Google in response to the search keyword gender-equal in Japanese, wherein the top fifteen Web pages are shown along with the relevant statis-tics. Table 2 shows the meanings of the twenty-five columns. 3.2 Analysis Result of Trustworthiness and Transparency First, we paid special attention to columns 10, 12, and 13. According to Golden Triangle, we carefully examined the characteristics of the first seven pages. The gender specialists 4 and 5 th were those pertaining to the sites that belonged to the gender advocates. Sec-ond, we paid special attention to columns 20 to 25. It is highly interesting to state that the rankings in these six Web sites were completely identical up to the 15 th placement with a minor mismatch. Based on this identification, we presumed that the ranking appearing in these columns was the  X  X riginal X  ranking according to Google X  X  ranking strategy. Third, we compared the ranking of Google X  X  SERP shown in column 10 to those of the SERPs of Google X  X  six partners. Obviously, they were not identical except for the top rank page, although they were recorded on the same date. Thus, we presumed that there might be a SERPs. In order to confirm the credibility of this presumption, we prepared the SERPs of Google recorded on December 7 and 27, 2005, one month and two weeks prior to recording the objective data for comparison, i.e., January 7, 2006. However, the conclu-sion was negative. In other words, it was observed that neither the SERP recorded on December 7, 2005, nor the one recorded on December 27, 2005, was identical or even similar to the SERPs of Google X  X  six partners recorded on January 7, 2006. These ex-aminations clarified that the SERPs of Google X  X  six partner sites were neither identical nor similar to Google X  X  SERP recorded on the same date, the one recorded two weeks ago, or the one recorded one month ago. Thus, we concluded that the SERPs of Google X  X  six partner sites could be the  X  X riginal X  SERP calculated by Google on that date. Fourth, we attempted to provide some explanations to resolve this disagreement. Through trial and error, we noticed a highly unexpected agreement. This agreement was noted when we carefully examined the rank of each page in the SERPs: The page that This identification is not disputed as much. However, the page that ranked second on Google X  X  SERP was placed third on the SERPs of Google X  X  six partners, i.e., this page was placed a rank above the one that might be originally calculated in Google and was delivered to Google X  X  partner sites. The difference was merely one rank. However, we paid special attention to identify the page on Google X  X  SERP that was ranked higher in comparison with the rank of that page on the SERPs of Google X  X  partners. The other results are as follows: The page that ranked third on Google X  X  SERP was two ranks higher, i.e., it might be ranked fifth in the original SERP. The page that ranked sixth on Google X  X  SERP was two ranks higher as compared with that on the partners X  SERPs, and the page that ranked seventh on Google X  X  SERP was two ranks higher as compared with that on the partners X  SERPs. As mentioned previously, the pages that ranked 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , 6 words, on studying the first seven pages of Google, we observed that all the pages of Google X  X  SERP whose ranks were higher in comparison with their ranks on its partner sites belonged to the gender-bashing sites. In other words, the ranks of the pages pertain-ing to the gender-bashing sites were equally ranked higher in Google X  X  SERP if they were compared with the SERPs of its partner sites. In contrast, we compared the rank of the pages on Google X  X  SERP that were operated by the gender advocates sites, with their ranks on its partners X  SERPs. We discovered that the page that ranked fourth on Google X  X  SERP was two ranks lower as compared with that on the SERPs of Google X  X  partner sites, and the page that ranked fifth on Google X  X  SERP was one rank lower as compared with its rank on the SERPs of Google X  X  partner sites. In other words, the ranks of pages pertaining to the gender advocates were equally ranked lower in Google X  X  SERP if they were compared with the SERPs of its partner sites. If we combine the abovemen-tioned discussions, the following unexpected agreement can be found: The ranks of the pages pertaining to the gender-bashing sects and gender advocates were consistently ranked higher and lower, respectively, on Google X  X  SERP if they were compared with the SERPs of its partner sites. 
By the transparency of a Web search site, we imply that the page ranking strategy for the SERP of that site is clear to searchers. Google uses Google X  X  PageRank TM algorithm which uses backlinks to determine a page rank. However, as is evident from Table 1, the correlation between the ranking of the Google SERP (column 10) and its PageRank (column 11) was not found. Since it is clarified that Google does not show backlinks from pages having PageRank value lesser than three and that it has stopped displaying all backlinks it knows, we paid special attention to Yahoo! search site and open source Web tools to obtain further accurate information pertaining to the backlinks. As an observa-tion result, although the number of backlinks presented in columns 2, 4, 6, and 7 are different, the tendency can certainly be interpreted. Again, we observe a very weak rela-tion between the ranking of a SERP and the number of backlinks. At the present when the gender-bashing war terminated, we cannot find any inconsis-tency between Google X  X  SERP and the SERPs of Google X  X  partner sites when we input the search keyword  X  X ender-equal.
