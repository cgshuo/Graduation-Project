 Folksonomy systems have shown to contribute to the qual-ity of Web search ranking strategies. In this paper, we analyze and compare different graph-based ranking algo-rithms, namely FolkRank, SocialPageRank, and SocialSim-Rank. We enhance these algorithms by exploiting the con-text of tag assignmets, and evaluate the results on the Group-Me! dataset. In GroupMe!, users can organize and maintain arbitrary Web resources in self-defined groups. When users annotate resources in GroupMe!, this can be interpreted in context of a certain group. The grouping activity deliv-ers valuable semantic information about resources and their context. We show how to use this information to improve the detection of relevant search results, and compare differ-ent strategies for ranking result lists in folksonomy systems.

Social tagging systems enable users to annotate Web con-tent with freely chosen keywords (tags), share these tags with other users of the application, and profit from the tag-ging activity of the whole user community by discovering / retrieving relevant Web content during browsing / as an-swers to search queries. The tagging activities are mod-eled in a folksonomy : a taxonomy, which evolves over time Figure 1: GroupMe! group about CIKM 2008 avail-able at http://groupme.org/GroupMe/group/2411. when users (the folks ) tag resources. A folksonomy can hence be interpreted as a set of user-tag-resource bindings (tag assignments). GroupMe! 1 [1] is a tagging system like del.icio.us or Flickr, which allows users to organize Web re-sources in groups. These GroupMe! groups, which can itself be grouped and annotated, can contain arbitrary multimedia resources like websites, photos or videos, which are visual-ized in a multimedia fashion so that content can be grasped immediatly without necessarily visiting each resource sep-arately. Figure 1 shows, e.g., a group about CIKM 2008, which contains the news feed of the conference, a video about Napa Valley, etc.

By combining the grouping and tagging paradigms addi-tional context information is embedded into the tag assign-ments that form a folksonomy. Traditional user-tag-resource bindings are enriched with a group dimension indicating in context of which group a user assigned a certain tag to a resource (cf. GroupMe! folksonomies in [1]). In this paper, we evaluate several ranking strategies that exploit knowl-edge embodied in folksonomies. In particular, we http://groupme.org Table 1: Overview of different ranking strategies.
Table 1 gives an overview of the ranking strategies we ana-lyzed. The algorithms can be classified according to the type of entity they are able to rank ( applicable for ), e.g. Social-PageRank and SocialSimRank [3] can only rank resources and tags respectively, whereas the FolkRank algorithm [4], which adapts Personalized PageRank for folksonomies, com-putes a ranking score for all types of traditional folksonomy entities: users, tags, and resources. Another characteristic indicates whether the ranking algorithm is topic-sensitive or not. Topic-sensitive allow to adapt rankings to a certain con-text that is, e.g., given by a keyword query. SocialPageRank and SocialSimRank compute static, global rankings inde-pendent of the context, whereas the other algorithms com-pute topic-sensitive rankings. GRank [2] allows to detect and rank relevant resources according to a keyword query. It not only analyzes the tags of a resource r but also the tags of a group r is contained in and the tags of resources that are grouped with r . GFolkRank [2] is an adaption of FolkRank and interprets groups as artificial, unique tags. GFolkRank + extends GFolkRank with the feature of prop-agating tags, which have been assigned to a group, to its resources. For a detailed description of the ranking algo-rithms the reader is referred to [2].
We evaluated the algorithms listed in Table 1 in context of two application scenarios (1) search for resources and (2) tag recommendation. The experiments were processed on a snapshot of the GroupMe! dataset.

Figure 2 lists the results of the search evaluations, where the task was to put resources into an order so that resources, which are most relevant to a keyword query, appear at the very top of the ranking. For the non-topic-sensitive al-gorithms we eased the task and applied GSearch (GRank without ranking) to detect a base set of relevant resources, which only had to be re-ranked. The group-sensitive algo-rithms outperformed the other algorithms, e.g. GFolkRank performed significantly better (one-tailed t-test, significance level  X  = 0 . 05) than FolkRank and SocialPageRank with respect to the overlapping similarity (OSim) that was mea-sured with respect to a test set of hand-selected rankings (KSim measures the quality of the relative order of the ranked entities).

In our tag recommendation experiments we applied a leave-many-out evaluation , which means that we removed all tags of the actual resource r , for which recommendations should be computed, and challenged the algorithms to compute a ranking of tags so that the removed tags (= relevant tags ) appear at the very top of the ranking. Hence, we tested the quality of tag recommendations for untagged resources, which is an important task in tagging systems, because many resources (e.g. more than 50% in the GroupMe! dataset) do not not have a single tag. The non-group-sensitive ranking strategies are not able to solve this task adequately. Hence, Table 2 lists only the results of recommendation strategies that exploit the group context. The FolkRank-based strate-gies produce outstanding results and clearly outperform So-cialSimRank. GFolkRank is the most successful strategy with respect to the mean reciprocal rank (MRR), which in-dicates at which rank the first relevant tag occurs on average, and S@1 , which stands for the mean probability that a rel-evant tag occurs at rank 1 of the tag recommendation rank-ing. FolkRank gains the highest precision at rank 3 ( P@3 ). For the given task of recommending tags to untagged re-sources, the utilization of the group context is indispens-able. In our experiments all strategies apply the tag cloud of the group(s) the actual resource, for which tags should be recommended, as preference. For more details see [2].
Folksonomy systems are valuable sources for improving search for multimedia Web resources. In this paper, we have described, proposed, and extended several graph-based ranking strategies for folksonomy systems, and evaluated and compared their performances with respect to search and tag recommendation tasks. In addition, we analyzed the ef-fect of using additional information about the context, in which some tagging activity took place, namely the group context provided by social systems like GroupMe!, on search and ranking. We show that the group context has great im-pact on the performance of search strategies, and provides excellent results for the task to recommend tags even to un-tagged resources. [1] F. Abel, M.
