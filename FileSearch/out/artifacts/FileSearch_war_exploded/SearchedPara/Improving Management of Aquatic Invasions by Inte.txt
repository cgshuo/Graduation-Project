 The unintentional transport of invasive species (i.e., non-native and harmful species that adversely affect habitats and native species) through the Global Shipping Network (GSN) causes substantial losses to social and economic wel-fare (e.g., annual losses due to ship-borne invasions in the Laurentian Great Lakes is estimated to be as high as USD 800 million). Despite the huge negative impacts, manage-ment of such invasions remains challenging because of the complex processes that lead to species transport and es-tablishment. Numerous difficulties associated with quan-titative risk assessments (e.g., inadequate characterizations of invasion processes, lack of crucial data, large uncertain-ties associated with available data, etc.) have hampered the usefulness of such estimates in the task of supporting the authorities who are battling to manage invasions with lim-ited resources. We present here an approach for addressing the problem at hand via creative use of computational tech-niques and multiple data sources, thus illustrating how data mining can be used for solving crucial, yet very complex problems towards social good. By modeling implicit species exchanges as a network that we refer to as the Species Flow Network (SFN), large-scale species flow dynamics are stud-ied via a graph clustering approach that decomposes the SFN into clusters of ports and inter-cluster connections. We then exploit this decomposition to discover crucial knowledge on how patterns in GSN affect aquatic invasions, and then illus- X

Invasive species (i.e., non-native species that adversely af-fect habitats and bioregions) are among the top three drivers of global environmental change. Such invasive species in-clude both plants and animals, and cause substantial eco-nomic and environmental harm by outcompeting or preying on native species. For instance, the impacts of aquatic inva-sions include increased diseases in humans (e.g., cholera ) and aquaculture species (e.g., fish virus), losses of wild-caught fisheries (e.g, comb jelly invasion of the Black Sea ), and losses of other ecosystem services. From an economic perspective, the estimated annual damage and control costs of invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than USD 120 billion [19]. These species are introduced via the networks of human trade and travel, and analyzing these networks can illuminate potential management strategies, regulatory policies, incentive structures, and risks from chang-ing climate.
 Ship-borne invasive species problem. The Global Ship-ping Network (GSN) is the dominant global vector for un-intentional translocation of non-native aquatic species [17]: species get translocated via ballast water (during ballast wa-ter uptake/discharge) and biofouling (i.e., the accumulation of microorganisms, plants, algae, or animals) on the sur-faces of ships [8]. To reduce invasion risks, authorities (e.g., International Maritime Organization (IMO)) have proposed standards for the maximum density of organisms that can be discharged in ships X  ballast water. These standards are based on the premise that reducing the concentration of live organisms in ballast tanks will reduce the number of inva-sions, but the extent to which this approach will actually reduce the invasion risk is unknown. In addition, this ap-proach does not address invasions via biofouling, nor does it consider many poorly known, but likely significant, bi-ological and ecological factors that influence invasion risk. Moreover, the problem cannot be understood at a regional level, because ship-borne species can arrive from anywhere via the GSN. With all these uncertainties in place, decisions are still needed to be made about the most efficient ways to target limited management resources.
 Significance of the problem. In the few coastal areas with good invasive species monitoring, increased shipping connecting an expanding network of global ports is corre-lated with an accelerating accumulation curve of established species (e.g., San Francisco Bay), and is estimated to be re-sponsible for 69% of known aquatic invasions [17]. Although only a portion of species transported via GSN become inva-sive (i.e., spread, become abundant, and cause harm), en-vironmental and economic damages from these species are often large and increase over time [13, 15]. For instance, the annual loss to the US Great Lakes regional economy due to ship-borne aquatic invasive species may be as high as USD 800 million [22]. However, GSN undoubtedly pro-vides enormous benefits to the US economy, and is also re-sponsible for approximately 90% of global trade. Further-more, global trade patterns are optimized based on economic and trade considerations, but not necessarily to safeguard against aquatic invasions. Therefore, imposing expensive and cumbersome regulations on the shipping industry could cause serious adverse effects to a country X  X  economy and trade relationships.
 Motivation and Goals. It is clear that a thorough under-standing of ship-borne invasion risks in terms of overall data about trade patterns, ports, vessel types, etc. is necessary to devise practices and policies that are feasible, effective and capable of bringing to bear the net long-term benefits to human welfare. With this motivation, our goal is to de-velop computational and data-driven frameworks that can inform invasive species management policies and practices.
Ship-borne invasions are a result of a complex interplay of ship traffic, ballast uptake/discharge dynamics, species survival during transport, various environmental/biological variables, etc [28]. Incorporating these complexities into a quantitative risk assessment framework is extremely diffi-cult, since the majority of the governing relationships are poorly quantified. The few studies that have attempted to quantify invasion risks via probabilistic approaches [14, 24] have relied on multiple simplifying assumptions. Moreover, usefulness of these approaches towards development of ef-ficient invasion management policies is further hampered by the inability to incorporate crucial invasion mechanisms (e.g.,  X  X tepping-stone X  process) into risk assessment. How-ever, numerous streams of data that capture vessel move-ment patterns, ballast uptake/discharge and other environ-mental/biological factors (that affect species transport and establishment) are increasingly being collected by several agencies for research/commercial purposes. Therefore, one can creatively combine domain expertise and computational data analysis to understand the underlying patterns of ship-borne invasions in order to develop a sufficient understand-ing towards the development of effective and economical management strategies. Our work is in fact a multi-disciplinary attempt towards utilizing this data to create insights and knowledge that can eventually lead to decision-making tools for policy makers.
 Data. We now introduce the numerous data sources utilized for the research (i) Vessel movement data: made available by Lloyd X  X  (ii) Ballast discharge data: made available by the Na-(iii) Ecoregion data: are available via Marine Ecoregions (iv) Environmental data: on port temperature and salin-Problem Statement. Given the complexity of the prob-lem and lack of relationships that are required for robust risk assessment, we set forth to extract knowledge on large-scale patterns of GSN in order to obtain better insight to-wards ship-borne invasions of non-indigenous species. Fur-thermore, we will illustrate how such knowledge can be used to derive efficient invasion management strategies. Framework. Our method is devised to tackle the limita-tions due to lack of data and governing relationships that are required for quantitative risk assessment. Towards this, we take the following approach: (i) a network that represents the general species flow tendency among ports is built; then, utilizing a graph clustering method [21] that operates on the basis of flow-dynamics, (ii) a map [12,27] of the species flow network, i.e., a cogent representation that extracts the main structure of flow while retaining information about relation-ships among modules (of main structure), is built; finally, using this map that summarizes the species flow dynam-ics in terms of clusters (or groups) of ports and highlights inter-cluster (i.e., between clusters) and intra-cluster (i.e., within cluster) relationships, (iii) the impact of GSN dy-namics on aquatic invasions is studied in conjunction with ecological and environmental aspects that govern species es-tablishment.

We provide a data-driven foundation for more effective and efficient risk assessment and management by modeling the spread of aquatic non-indigenous species through the GSN, which is the most important vector of aquatic inva-sions. We have discovered vital information on patterns of GSN that can inform management strategies and regulatory policies. In a potential deployed configuration (see Fig. 2), the discovered knowledge can efficiently be used to analyze the invasion risks with respect to changing climate, policy and infrastructure. Understanding the structure of the com-ponent networks and the dynamic interactions between the different networks is crucial to the design of policies that could cost-effectively reduce invasions.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the formulation of species flow networks using LMIU and NBIC data, graph clustering approach for understanding the large-scale dynamics of GSN, and the main discoveries; Section 3 presents invasion risk assessment that incorporates ecore-gion definitions and environmental conditions via a unique graphical approach; Section 4 presents how the emerging knowledge and methods can be potentially deployed towards development of species management strategies; and finally, Section 5 contains the concluding remarks.
The basic idea behind our work is to find patterns of species flow in order to identify ports and shipping routes for which interventions would be the most effective in stopping invasions through the entire network. Such knowledge can then be further leveraged with auxiliary information (e.g., vessel types) in order to inform management strategies in a targeted manner. Since GSN naturally forms a graph, LMIU and NBIC data can be utilized to build a network to rep-resent species flow among ports (see Fig. 3). This network can then be analyzed via graph mining or network science techniques to extract relevant insights. Let G  X  ( N , E ) be a directed weighted graph, where N  X  { n 1 ,...,n n } and E  X  N  X N denote the set of nodes and edges of G , respectively. Let the nodes in N corre-spond to ports visited by vessels in the GSN and the weight of the directed edge e ij  X  E given by w ij  X  (0 , 1] repre-sents the total probability of species flow corresponding to all vessels traveling from port n i to n j (without intermedi-ate stopovers), for all n i ,n j  X  X  .
 Species Flow Estimation. Estimation of exact amounts of species exchanged between ports is extremely difficult. However, as proposed in [24], vessel movement and ballast discharge data can be leveraged to estimate the likelihood of species exchange. We now briefly explain how LMIU and NBIC datasets are used to estimate species flow (i.e., the edge weights of G ) and refer the interested reader to [24] for a comprehensive discussion on probabilistic species flow modeling including details on model assumptions, develop-ment and validation. (a) Calculation of edge weights: Consider a vessel v trav-(b) Estimation of ballast discharge: Information avail-Characteristics of the SFN. Summary of characteristics for SFNs generated for the four available years of data are shown in Table 1. The path length of a network identifies the number of stops required to reach a given port from another. An average path length of three (3) is observed in all four SFNs. This is perhaps mainly due to the presence of hubs (i.e., ports that are connected to many other ports) in GSN (e.g., Singapore). The in-/out-degree of a node is defined as the number of other nodes connected to/by it. Therefore, average degree in SFN describes the average number of direct pathways of species introduction. Furthermore, as empirical evaluations for power law degree distribution [5] suggest that SFNs fall under the category of scale-free networks [3], for degree  X  139.

Complex networks are efficient abstractions for highly com-plex systems that consist of numerous, often complex under-lying patterns and relationships. However, these abstrac-tions still remain too complex to derive useful inferences. Therefore, a decomposition that represents such complex networks via modules and their interactions [10, 18, 23] can be very useful in understanding the underlying patterns. We utilize a graph clustering approach in order to simplify the underlying flow dynamics of SFN. The clusters can capture the ship movement activity among ports leading to a better identification of risk corridors, which can then be used to es-timate invasion risk based on ecological and environmental conditions.
 Choice of Clustering Method. For the task at hand, we are interested in understanding how the structure of SFN re-lates to species flow across the network. Therefore, among many alternatives, MapEquation [21] X  X  graph clustering method that attempts to decompose the network with re-spect to flow-dynamics (in comparison to optimization of modularity ) X  X s used. The basic principle of operation be-hind MapEquation-based clustering stems from the notions of information theory, which states the fact that a data stream can be compressed by a code that exploits regulari-ties in the process that generates the stream [25]. Therefore, a group of nodes among which information flows quickly and easily can be aggregated and described as a single well connected module; the links between modules capture the avenues of information flow between those modules. MapE-quation identifies clusters by optimizing the entropy corre-sponding to intra-and inter-cluster in a recursive manner X  the clusters identified cannot be further refined or parti-tioned.
 Clusters of Ports based on Species Flow. Cluster-ing analysis of SFN reveals several clusters of ports. These clusters represent groups of ports among which the species exchange is relatively higher; if inter-cluster pathways are controlled, species flow would be combinatorially reduced. Once such clusters are identified, species flow characteristics within clusters can be analyzed in conjunction with ecolog-ical and environmental data for invasion risk assessment. While clustering is derived based on species flow dynamics, geographical orientation of the major (in terms of aggre-gated flow) clusters is also intuitive (see Fig. 4). A few ma-jor clusters correspond to a significant proportion of total species flow among ports (see Table 2 for major ports that are in 6 of these major clusters). For instance, in 2005 X 2006, six (6) major clusters (out of 64 in total), viz., the clus-ters of Pacific , Mediterranean , Western_Europe , East-ern_North_America , Indian_Ocean and South_America con-tained 68.6% of total ports and corresponded to 76.3% of the total species flow.
 Cluster Consistency. From a deployment perspective, perhaps the most crucial contribution of our analysis is that these major clusters continue to exist over the duration stud-ied; for a given cluster, while some ports leave/join over time, the vast majority of the ports continue to remain in the same cluster (see Fig. 5). This provides a solid foundation for devising management strategies targeting clusters and inter-cluster connections to efficiently control species flow. Furthermore, evolution of clusters (or how the clustering patterns change over time) can reveal important information on how changes in vessel movement (and ballast discharge) patterns affect species flow dynamics. For instance, the ex-change of the order of the two clusters Mediterranean and Western_Europe from 2002 X 2003 to 2005 X 2006 indicates a relative increase of species exchange among ports that be-long to these clusters during 2005 X 2006, which can be at-tributed to the merger of a significant proportion of ports be-longing to Mediterranean cluster with South European At-lantic Shelf cluster to form the Tropical_East_Atlantic cluster in 2005 X 2006. Another example is the formation of a new smaller cluster (the eighth in Fig. 5) in 1999 X 2000 by 21 ports in California and Hawaii, including ports such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego that previously belonged to the Pacific cluster in 1997 X 1998. Such changes can reveal large-scale trends that may be very useful in de-vising long term management strategies.
Quantification of invasion risk is a challenging problem be-cause of the complex interactions between species and their abiotic and biotic environment [28]. Here, we shift our at-tention from inter-cluster species flow to intra-cluster (i.e., ports within a cluster) NIS invasion risk in order to gain insight into the plausibility of invasions in terms of environ-mental similarity. Previous studies have assumed that the invasion risk is proportional to Euclidean distance between annual averages of temperature and salinity [9, 14, 24]. How-ever, this assumption may not be valid for invasive species that often exhibit broad environmental tolerances [7, 11]. We take an approach that is based on biogeographic pat-terns, and empirically observed temperature and salinity tolerances for ranking invasion risks.
For an exchange of species to become an invasion, the introduced species must be: (i) non-indigenous, viz., move-ments between non-contiguous ecoregions; and (ii) able to survive and establish in its new environment. Invasion risk between port environments can then be ranked by consid-ering a species assemblage (or a collection) that contains  X  X eneralist X  and  X  X pecialist X  species. We have taken this ap-proach to counteract the lack of relationships or data to cal-culate or estimate exact invasion risks. Based on tempera-ture and salinity tolerance levels (empirically-estimated long term thermal tolerances of marine invertebrate taxa [20]), we define invasion risk in terms of number of species groups that can tolerate the given conditions. Specifically, six (6) different species tolerance groups based on two (2) temper-ature and three (3) salinity tolerance levels are considered (see Table 3). Here, salinity tolerance levels were set to cap-ture species types that are completely intolerant to salinity (i.e., freshwater species), those that are restricted to marine waters (i.e., low tolerance), and species that can survive in a wide range of salinities (i.e., high tolerance). Risk between any two ports is then quantified as an index created by over-lapping the species tolerance groups as shown in Fig. 6.
Quantification of port-wise invasion risk is both difficult and not very useful in terms of species control and man-agement. In order to gain insight into what ports are at risk based on species flow and environmental similarity, we utilize a graphical representation that is referred to as the Invasion Risk Network (IRN). An IRN is built for every ma-jor cluster in SFN to intuitively represent the invasion risk based on how easily species can establish in the new envi-ronment (based on environmental tolerance, see Table 3). Note that IRN is an undirected weighted graph, since envi-ronmental match is symmetric, and the risk level (based on number of tolerance groups at risk) can vary between port pairs, respectively.
With the edges representing the invasion risk between ports, clustering can help detect groups of ports that have similar environmental conditions (while belonging to differ-ent ecoregions). The basic idea here is to exploit the fact that the invasion risk between groups of ports that are very dissimilar (e.g., fresh-water ports and marine ports) is lower than ports within the same group (with relatively similar conditions). Clustering analysis (Section 2.2) can therefore again be utilized on IRN to identify groups of ports that are similar in terms of invasion risk. The clusters detected here are sub-clusters of SFN clusters (that are based on species flow dynamics); therefore, if two ports are in the same clus-ter of IRN, then it is very likely for an invasion to occur between these two ports. Furthermore, if adequate species flow control is not in place, given the frequent species ex-changes and high chances of species establishment within ports in an IRN cluster, an invasion to one single port will immediately put all the other ports in the IRN sub-cluster at risk of an invasion. Therefore, IRN clusters identify groups of ports that would most benefit from some form of species flow control to avoid invasions.
 Note: Clustering based on flow-dynamics (simulating ran-dom walks) is used here for identifying ports with similar en-vironmental conditions, since an approach only considering pair-wise distance is not capable of capturing the stepping-stone effect.
Clustering analysis on SFN has discovered a consistent pattern of port groupings in terms of potential species ex-changes. One can easily identify such regions at risk, by overlaying the ecoregions to the IRN clusters above (see Fig. 9(a)). This allows one to consider the four factors of ves-sel movement, ballast discharge, environmental conditions, and ecoregion in a unique but an intuitive fashion. With this knowledge in place, species exchange among ports can be efficiently controlled by management strategies that tar-get high species exchange pathways in order to isolate ports and clusters of ports.
Consider Fig. 8 which illustrates the inter-and intra-cluster species flow among major clusters. While we observe some changes in inter-cluster connections, major clusters and species exchange pathways are virtually consistent over time. There-fore, by limiting species flow on inter-cluster connections, species exchanges among ports could be restricted to ports within clusters. This will combinatorially reduce the species introduction pathways.

For instance, consider the Pacific cluster in year 2005 X  2006. There are 37,596 inter-cluster connections, where Ta-ble 4 tabulates the strongest connections. Singapore alone contributes to approximately 26% of total inter-cluster flow from/to Pacific cluster that contains 818 ports (see Fig. 9 for an illustration of invasion risk with respect to Singapore). Here, via targeted ballast management on inter-cluster con-nections to/from Singapore and a few other  X  X nfluential X  ports, inter-cluster flow from/to Pacific cluster can be sig-nificantly reduced (see Fig. 9(b)).

Table 5 lists ports corresponding to the highest inter-cluster flow in major clusters for 2005 X 2006. Any practices that reduced species movements through these ports would potentially reduce a large proportion of inter-cluster species flow. Increases in species surveillance in these ports would strengthen the foundation for geographic allocation of risk management efforts. Finally, increased surveillance of ports would provide a baseline against which to measure the ef-fectiveness of future risk reduction efforts X  X  baseline that is now largely absent globally (Costello et al. 2007)
Average path length of three (3) that is observed on SFN indicates that species could be translocated between any two given ports within two (2) stopovers on average. This indi-cates a generally high risk of invasions in the absence of risk reduction practices. In order to understand the impact of targeted ballast management on average path length, a test scenario based on a hypothetical SFN X  d SFN is derived as follows: (i) choose an SFN (SFN corresponding to 2005 X  2006 LMIU dataset was chosen for our experiment); then, (ii) identify 20% of all ports with the highest degree (see Table 6); and, finally (iii) generate d SFN by removing all edges to/from the above ports; this corresponds to ballast management with 100% efficiency, i.e., zero (0) species flow from/to these ports. Then, the average path length increases to 6.4 indicating that it will be at least twice as difficult for species to be translocated from one port to another. Further-more, higher average path length also implies, (i) longer travel times (hence, very lower chance of survival for species during the voyage) and (ii) increased number of interme-diate stop-overs (which is likely to dilute ballast water and expose organisms to multiple shocks).

The exact amount of species relocated by a vessel depends on many factors: ballast size, average duration per trip, fre-quently visited ports, etc. Furthermore, vessel types we ob-serve in GSN are often chosen for specific tasks (e.g., oil transportation, vehicle transportation, etc.) and these ves-sels often have their respective frequent ports/routes. There-fore, we investigate the relationship of vessel types to inter-and intra-cluster species flow in order to understand existing patterns that can be helpful in devising species management strategies (based on the 2005-2006 LMIU dataset). (i) Frequent inter-cluster travelers: While not being (ii) Frequent intra-cluster travelers: Among the most
With proper species control on inter-cluster connections, species flow can be confined to clusters. Even though ports within a cluster have higher species exchanges among them, if the environmental conditions are significantly different, invasions are less likely to occur. On the other hand, for ports in the same IRN cluster (hence, environmental condi-tions are very similar), if proper species flow control is not in place, invasions will be nearly unavoidable. For instance, in the Pacific cluster, we observe that Hong Kong, Qing-dao and Kaohsiung have higher species exchanges among them; and, following clustering analysis of IRN, we also no-tice that Hong Kong and Kaohsiung are in the same IRN cluster. Therefore, invasions are very likely to occur in be-tween these two ports. On the other hand, Qingdao is in a different sub-cluster to Hong Kong, indicating these two ports have significantly different environmental conditions X  invasions are less likely to happen between these two ports, even with high species exchanges.
Aquatic invasions via the GSN are a result of a complex interplay of ship traffic, ballast uptake/discharge dynamics, species survival during transport and numerous environmen-tal/biological variables. The inherent complexity of the in-vasive species problem has made risk assessment very dif-ficult, and thereby has severely hampered the effectiveness of species management efforts. To that end, we have devel-oped an approach for more effective and efficient risk assess-ment and management by modeling the spread of aquatic non-indigenous species through the GSN, which is the most important vector of aquatic invasions. Knowledge about the patterns of GSN, within the context of species flow and inva-sion risk, appropriate risk assessments can be generated to help inform management strategies and regulatory policies.
In a management context, the discovered knowledge could efficiently be used to analyze the invasion risks with re-spect to changing climate, policy and infrastructure. Un-derstanding the structure of the component networks and the dynamic interactions between the different networks is crucial to the design of policies that could cost-effectively reduce invasions. The analyses outlined and performed in this paper could also be used to geographically prioritize species surveillance efforts using traditional organism sam-pling methods (e.g., water samples, nets) and/or newer ge-netic approaches [4]. Furthermore, our work illustrates the value of creative use of data mining for social good via the application to a significant societal problem.
