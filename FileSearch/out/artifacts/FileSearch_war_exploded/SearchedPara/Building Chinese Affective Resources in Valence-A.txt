 Sentiment analysis has emerged as a leading tech-nique to automatically identify affective infor-mation from texts (Pang and Lee, 2008; Calvo and D'Mello, 2010; Liu, 2012; Feldman, 2013). In sen-timent analysis, affective states are generally rep-resented using either categorical or dimensional approaches.

The categorical approach represents affective states as several discrete classes such as positive, neutral, negative, and Ekman X  X  six basic emotions (e.g., anger, happiness, fear, sadness, disgust and surpris e) (Ekman, 1992). Based on this representa-tion, various practical applications have been de-veloped such as aspect -based sentiment analysis (Schouten and Frasincar, 2016; Pontiki et al., 2015), Twitter sentiment analysis (Saif et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al. , 2015), deceptive opinion spam de-tection (Li et al., 2014), and cross -lingual portabil-ity (Banea et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2015).

The dimensional approach represents affective states as continuous numerical values in multiple dimensions, such as valence-arousal (VA) space (Russell, 1980), as shown in Fig. 1. The valence represents the degree of pleasant and unpleasant (i.e., positive and negative) feelings, while the arousal represents the degree of excitement and calm. Based on this representation, any aff ective state can be represented as a point in the VA coor-dinate plane. For many application domains (e.g., product review s, political stance detection, etc.) , it can be useful to identify highly negative -arousing and highly positive -arousing texts because they are usually of interest to many users and should be given a higher priority. Dimensional sentiment analysis can accomplish this by recognizing the va-lence -arousal ratings of texts and rank ing them ac-cordingly to provide more intelligent and fine -grained services.

In developing dimensional sentiment applica-tions, a ffective lexicons and corpora with valence-arousal ratings are useful resources but few exist, especially for the Chinese language. Therefore, this study focuse s on building Chinese valence -arousal resources, including a n affective lexicon called the Chinese valence-arousal words (CVAW) and an affective corpus called the Chinese valence-arousal text (CVAT). The CVAW contains 1,653 affective words annotated with v alence-arousal ratings by five annotators. The CVAT contains 2,009 sen-tences extracted from web texts annotated with crowd -sourced valence-arousal ratings. To further demonstrate the feasibility of the constructed re-sources, we conduct an experiment to pre dict the VA ratings of the CVAT corpus using CVAW words , and compare its performance to a similar evaluation of English affective resources.

To our best knowledge, only one previous study has manually created a small number (162) of Chi-nese VA words (Wei et al, 2011), and none have focused on creating Chinese VA corpora . This pi-lot study thus aims to build such resources to en-rich the research and development of multi -lingual sentiment analysis in VA dimensions . The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces existing affective lexicons and corpora. Section 3 describes the process of build-ing the Chinese affective resource. Section 4 pre-sents the analysis results and feasibility evaluation . Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 5. Affective resources are usually obtained by either self -labeling or manual annotation. In the self -labeling approach, users proactively provide their feelings and opinions after browsing the web con-tent. For example, users may read a news article and then offer comments. A user can also review the products available for sale in online stores. In the manual annotation method, trained annotators are asked to create affective annotations for specif-ic language resources for research purposes. Sev-eral well -known affective resources are introduced as follo ws.

SentiWordNet is a lexical resource for opinion mining, which assigns to each synset of WordNet three sentiment ratings: positive, negative, and ob-jective (Esuli and Sebastiani , 2006). Linguistic In-quiry and Word Count (LIWC) calculates the de-gree to wh ich people use different categories of words across a broad range of texts ( Pennebaker et al., 2007). In the LIWC 2007 version, the annota-tors were asked to note their emotions and thoughts about personally relevant topics. The Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) provides 1,034 English words with ratings in the dimensions of pleasure, arousal and dominance (Bradley and Lang, 1999) . In a ddition to the se English -language sentiment lexicons , a few Chinese lexicons have been constructed. The Chinese LIWC (C -LIWC) dictionary is a Chinese translation of the LIWC with manual revisions to fit the practical character-istics of Chinese usages (Huang et al., 2012). The NTU Sentiment dictionary (NTUSD) has a dopted a combination of manual and automatic methods to include positive and negative emotional words (Ku and Chen, 2007). Among the above affective lexi-cons, only ANEW is dimensional , provid ing real -valued scores for three dimensions, and the others are categorical , providing information related to sentiment polarity or intensity . 
In addition to lexicon resources, several English -language affective corpora have been proposed, such as Movie Review Data (Pang et al. 2002), the MPQA Opinion Corpus (Wiebe et a l., 2005), and Affective Norms for English Text (ANET ) (Brad-ley and Lang, 2007). In addition, only ANET pro-vide s VA ratings . The above dimensional affective resources ANEW and ANET have been used for both word-and sentence-level VA prediction in previous studies (Wei et al., 2011; G X k X ay et al., 2012; Malandrakis et al., 2013; Paltoglou et al ., 2013; Yu et al., 2015 ). In this study, w e follow the manual annotation approach to build a Chinese af-fective lexicon and corpus in the VA dimensions . This section describes the process of building Chi-nese affective resources with valence-arousal rat-ings , including the CVAW and CAVT. 
The CVAW is built on the Chinese affective lexicon C-LIWC, and then annotated with VA rat-ing s for each word. Five annotators were trained to rate each word in the valence and arousal dimen-sions using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) model (Lang, 1980). The SAM model provides af-fective pictures, which can help annotators in de-termining more precise labe ls when rating the words. The valence dimension uses a nine degree scale. Values 1 and 9 respectively denote the most negative and positive degrees of affect. Point 5 means a neutral emotion without specific tendency. The arousal dimension uses a similar s cale to de-note calm and excitement Using this approach, each affective word can be annotated with VA rat-ings (determined by the average rating values pro-vided by the annotators) to form the CVAW. 
To build the CVAT , we first collected 720 web texts from six different categories: news articles, political discussion forums, car discussion forums, hotel reviews, book reviews, and laptop review s. A total of 2,009 sentences containing the greatest number of affective words found in the C -LIWC lexicon were selected for VA rating. The Google app engine was then used to implement a crowdsourcing annotation platform using the SAM annotation scheme. Volunteer annotators were asked to rate individual sentences from 1 to 9 in term s of valence and arousal. Each sentence was rated by at least 10 annotat ion s. Once the rating process was finished, a corpus cleanup procedure was performed to remove outlier ratings and im-proper sentences (e.g., those containing abusive or vulgar language ) . The outlier ratings were identi-fied if they did not fall into the interval of the mean plus/minus 1.5 standard deviations. They were then excluded from the calculati on of the average VA ratings for each sentence. 4.1 Analysis Results of CVA W A total of 1,653 words along with the annotated VA ratings were included in the CVAW lexicon, yielding the (mean, standard deviation) = (4.49, 1.81) for valence and (5.4 8, 1.26) for arousal. To analyze differences between the annotations, we compared the VA values rated by each annotator against their corresponding means across the five annotators to calculate the error rates using the fol-lowing metrics.  X  Mean A bsolute E rror (MAE):  X  Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): where A i denotes the valence or arousal value of word i rated by an annotator, valence or arousal of word i calculated over the five annotators, and n is the total number of words in the CVAW.

Table 1 shows the error rates of the annotators in rating the VA values of words in the CVAW. Overall, for all metrics the error rates of arousal ratings were greater than those of valence ratings. In addition, the annotators produced more con-sistent error rates (around 0.49~0.63 for MAE and 0.64~0.80 for RMSE) in the valence dimension than those (around 0.78~1.35 for MAE and 0.99~1.64 for RMSE) in the arousal dimension. These findings indicate that the degree of arousal was more difficult to distinguish than valence. Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of words in the CVAW, where each point represents the mean of the VA values as rated by the annotators. Several words (translated from Chinese) were marked in the VA space for reference, e.g., victory (7.8, 7.2) , trust (7.8, 5.8), pain (2.4, 6.8), kill (1.6, 7.8), tedi-ous (3.4, 3), fault (3.6, 4.6), agree (6.4, 4. 4) and re-laxed (6.2, 2.0). 4.2 Analysis Results of CVAT A total of 2,009 sentences with VA ratings were included in the CVAT corpus, yielding the (mean, standard deviation) = (4. 83, 1.37) for valence and (5.05, 0.95) for arousal. The distribution of the six categories and their word counts in CVAT are shown in Table 2. The largest categ ory was News (27%), while the smallest one w as Laptop (9%). Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of VA ratings for all sentences in CVAT. It is similar with the plot of the C VAW, indicating that annotators followed similar guidelines for rating affective words an d sentences.
 4.3 Results of Using CVAW to Predict the VA To demonstrate the a pplication of the constructed affective resources, this experiment adopted a sim-ple aggregate -and -average method (Taboada et al. 2011) to predict the VA ratings of the CVAT cor-pus using CVAW words. In this approach, the va-lence (or arousal) rating of a given sentence was calculated by averaging the valence (or arousal) ratings of the words matched in the CVAW in that sentence . Once the predicted values of the VA rat-ings for the sentences were obtained, they were compared to the corresponding actual values in the CVAT to calculate MAE, RMSE and Pearson cor-relation coefficient r , as shown in T able 2. Notice that the sentences which contain no affective words in the CVAW were not included for perfor-mance calculation (herein 30 sentences). The re-sults using ANEW to predict the VA rating of 20 English forum discussions were also included for comparison (Paltoglou et al., 2013).
 The results show that the average tokens of the CVAT sentences are around 35 which is much smaller than those of the English forum discus-sions (long texts ). Both English and Chinese re-sources had a similar error rates (MAE and RMSE) for valence, while the English resource outper-formed the Chinese resource in terms of arousal rates. In addition, both the En glish and Chinese re-sources h ad a low er correlation for arousal than for valence, indicating again that the arousal dimen-sion is more difficult to predict. Table 2 also shows the performance for each category in CVAT. For valence, Laptop achieved the lowest error rate, while News and Hotel had a higher correlation. The respective ranges of MAE, RMSE and r are 0.95~1.48, 1.21~1.77 and 0.30~0.61. For arousal, Book yielded the lowest error rate , while Hotel and Book yielded a better correlation. The respective ranges of MAE, RMSE and r are 0.8 9~1.11, 1.11~1.40 and 0.04~0.22. This study presents a Chinese affective lexicon with 1,653 words and a corpus of 2,009 sentences with six different categories, both annotated with valence-arousal values. A corpus cleanup proce-dure was used to remove outlier ratings and im-proper texts to improve quality. Experiment al re-sults provided a feasibility evaluation and baseline performance for V A prediction using the con-structed resources. Future work will focus on building useful dimensional sentiment applications based on the constructed resources.
