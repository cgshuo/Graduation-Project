Retroflex aspirates in Chinese are generally difficult for Japanese students learning pronunciation, because the Japanese language has no such sounds. In particular, discriminating between utterances with aspirated dental and retroflex students of Chinese uttering aspirated retroflex sounds modeled after examples uttered by a native Chinese instructor. However, the utterances sounded like a dental affricate to the instructor, and many students could not produce the correct sounds. They could not curl their tongue s enough to articulate correctly, because there is no retroflex sounds in Japanese syllables.

We previously [1,2,3,4,5] showed that the breathing power during voice onset nese aspirates. We also developed an automatic evaluation system [6,7] for the students pronouncing Chinese aspirated a ffricates in accordance with the two parameters of VOT length and the breathing power during VOT. roflex and the dental affricat es, we extracted the features of correctly pronouncing breathed power during VOT of sounds uttered by Chinese native speakers. For this research, we developed a 35-channel frequency filter bank by using a person-al computer. We found that the main difference between aspirated dental and retroflex affricates appeared in the spectrogram of the breathed power during VOT [8].

We will continue to apply our system to other Chinese aspirated affricates to develop automatic training system.

The lower part of th e figure shows the waveform of the volt-age evolution picked up by a microphone. The ordinate extended upward shows the frequency component and the shade of the stripes implies the approximate power level at the corresponding time and frequency.

The VOT of the aspirated dental sound ce[  X   X   X  ] was long, 180 power there. dental syllable ce[  X   X   X  ] (right) pronounced by Chinese speaker in accordance with weak breathing power. The distinctive feature of aspirated retroflex affricates is that they have a non-uniform spectrum in frequency and/or time during VOT, whereas aspirated dental ones have a rather uniform spectrum, as shown in the right spectrogram. 
We showed that the correct utterance of aspirated retroflex and dental affri-cates is closely related to the frequency spectrum in VOT. breathing power by using a personal computer containing a 35-channel frequency filter bank, designed using MATLAB, in which the center frequency ranged from 50 to 6850 Hz with a bandwidth of 200 Hz [6,7]. We can extract the features of aspirated retroflex affricates and aspirated dental affricates of the frequency spec-trum in both VOT and voiced periods. 3.1 VOT Measurement Algorithm 
We automatically detected the onset of burst. Pronounced signals were intro-duced into the filter bank and split into the power at each center frequency every 5 ms. The start time of VOT, t1, was determined by comparing the powers for the adjacent time frames when the number of temporally increasing channels was maximum. The end of VOT, t2, was the star t point of the formant. Thus, t2-t1 is defined as VOT. roflex affricates by observing the tempor al variation of breathing power spectrum during VOT in Chapter 2. The powers at each frequency of th e 35 channels every 5 ms with 11.025 kHz sampling were added in accordance with the frequency criteria defined in Chapter 2 during VOT. 3.2 Breathing Pow er Measurement Algorithm 
The average power during VOT is defined as follows. The powers are deduced every 5ms and are referred to as Pi,j. which is the power at j X 5ms of the i(1-35)-channel, as shown in Equation (1). Thus the energy Wi of the i-channel is defined as The average power, Pi,av, of each frequency channel during VOT is defined as The average power at i-channel in voiced period, Tvs, Pvi,av can be defined similarly as 
Although several reports [9,10] on voiced retroflex have been published, there have been few reports on aspirated retrof lex. We define the discrimination criteria the breathing power spectrum during VOT of pronunciation of the pairs ca[  X   X  X ] -dents. We used our automatic measuring system to define the parameters. 4.1 Scoring of Pronunciation Quality of Students 
To investigate the correct pronunciation criteria of th e aspirated retroflex affri-ci[  X   X  X ], and ce[  X   X   X  ], the sounds uttered by 20 Japanese students were ranked using a listening test of the reproduced sounds conducted by nine native Chinese speak-flex affricate or aspirated de ntal affricate; 2 = unclear sounds; and 1 = pronuncia-sounds and vice versa. We defined an average score of more than 2.6 as good. This score corresponds to the case in whic h six examiners give a score of  X 3 X  and very close to the microphone, and sounds with a low S/N uttered away from the microphone. 4.2 Relationship between Scoring of Student Pronunciation and Evalua-tion Parameters 
We now discuss the distribution of the student data with their scores are dis-played on the surface of VOT and power respectively on abscissa and ordinate. 
Figure 4 shows the data distributions on the surface of VOT and power with the scores of student pronunciations of aspirated retroflex cha[t  X   X  X ] and aspirated dental ca[  X   X  X ]. The power of each utterance in this figure was automatically cal-culated at the frequencies between 2750 Hz (Channel-15) and 5750 Hz (Channel-29) averaged during the start time of VOT to 1/2VOT. The pronunciations of cha[t  X   X  X ] with a good score gathered in the upper right from the center of the fig-continuous sequence of fricative articulations, and utterances with the power weaker than 16 received low scores. As for the utterance of aspirated dental data with the power of 8~12 scored higher than 2.8. The two data points of aspi-rated dental syllable ca[  X   X  X ], located at the top left, received a low score, presum-ably because unnecessary cu rling of the tongue resulted in high power utterance. 
Figure 5 shows the data distributions on the surface of VOT and power with and aspirated dental affricate ci[  X   X  X ]. The power of each utterance in this figure is summed one between the frequencies of 1750 Hz (Channel-10) and 6350 Hz (Channel-32) in VOT. The utterance with power higher than 25 of aspirated retro-powers that are too low to pass the scoring test, i.e. 1.8, 1.6, and 1.2. As for utter-ances of aspirated dental syllable ci[  X   X  X ], the data with powers of 16~22 obtained higher scores. 
Figure 6 shows the data distributions on the surface of VOT and power with and aspirated dental affricate ce[  X   X   X  ]. The power of each utterance in this figure is summed one between the frequencies of 1150 Hz (Channel-7) and 5950 Hz (Channel-30) in VOT. Pronunciations of the aspirated retroflex affricate chi[t  X   X   X  ] with the power higher than 34 scored higher than 2.7. Pronunciations with the power lower than 32 were not correct. For the pronunciations of the aspirated dental affricate ce[  X   X   X  ], the data with the power be tween 20~26 obtain successful scores. 5.1 Parameters for Discrimination .

If the power was higher than 17 between 2750 Hz (CH15) and 5750 Hz (CH29) averaged during the onset of VOT to 1/2 of VOT, the utterances were 25 between 1750 Hz (CH10) and 6350 Hz (CH32) throughout VOT, the utteranc-than 34 at the frequencies between 1150 Hz (CH7) and 5950 Hz (CH30) averaged during the onset of VOT to 2/3 of VOT, the utterances were judged to be aspirat-ed retroflex affricate che[t  X   X   X  ]. power appears between 750 and 950Hz, 1150 and 1350 Hz, and 2150 and 2350 power appeared between 150 and 350 Hz, 1350 and 1550 Hz, and 2550 and 2750 power appeared at the frequency channels between 350 and 550 Hz, 1150 and 1350 Hz, and 2350 and 2550 Hz, the utterances were judged to be aspirated den-tal syllable ce[  X   X   X  ]. 5.2 Experiment and Results 
We tried to discriminate between the pronunciations of the pairs ca[  X   X  X ] -four native Chinese speakers.

In step 2, the s ounds are automatically analyzed using our developed 32-channel filter bank to create a database of the temporal variation of power spectrum. In step 3, VOT is deduced using the algorithm described in Sub-section 3.1. nel during VOT, as described in Subsection 3.2. In step 5, if any distinctive fea-and discriminated by referring to Table 1. 
If there are no distinctive features during VOT, they are judged to be aspirated dental affricates and discriminated referring to Table 2.

All utterances were evaluated to be correct by a listening test involv ing four native Chinese speakers. The correct judgment rate of aspirated retroflex affricate cha[t  X   X  X ] was 95%. One sample was too weak to be correctly detected. The correct judgment rate of retroflex affricate chi[t  X   X  X ] was the perfect at 100%, and that of aspirated retroflex affricate che[t  X   X   X  ] was the lowest at 90%. One utterance was too weak and anoth-er was too strong. were perfect at 100%, and that of aspirated dental affricate ce[  X   X   X  ] was 95%. One utterance had too little power. 
We have been studying the instruction of pronunciation of Chinese aspirated sounds, which are generally difficult for Japanese students to perceive and repro-duce. We closely examined the spectrograms of uttered sounds by native Chinese speakers and Japanese students and determined the criteria for correct pronuncia-tions of various aspirated sounds [1-5]. We previously developed an automatic system for measuring and calculating the VOT and the power during VOT of student pronunciations [6,7]. utterance during VOT and voiced periods an d extracted the distinctive feature of each utterance. Then we established crite ria for automatically discriminating aspi-rated retroflex and aspirated dental sounds. Japanese students using our automatic discriminating system. The results of the test showed that the system exhibited an av erage correct judgment rate for three 95% or more for the pronunciations evaluated to be correct by native speakers. motion of Sciences (JSPS).
