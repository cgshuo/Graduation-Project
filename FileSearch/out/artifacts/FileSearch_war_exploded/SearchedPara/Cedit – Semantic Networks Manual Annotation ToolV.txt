 Cedit is a part of a project to create a rich resource of manually annotated semantic structures (Nov  X  ak, 2007) as a new layer of the Prague Dependency Treebank (Sgall et al., 2004). The new layer is based on the MultiNet paradigm described in (Hel-big, 2006). 1.1 Prague Dependency Treebank The Prague Dependency Treebank is a language resource containing a deep manual analysis of text (Sgall et al., 2004). PDT contains three lay-ers of annotation, namely morphological , analytical (shallow dependency syntax) and tectogrammatical (deep dependency syntax). The units of each annota-tion level are linked to corresponding units from the shallower level. The morphological units are linked directly to the original text.

The theoretical basis of the treebank is described by the Functional Generative Description of lan-guage system (Sgall et al., 1986). 1.2 MultiNet Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (Multi-Net), described in (Helbig, 2006), provide a univer-sally applicable formalism for treatment of semantic phenomena of natural language. They offer distinct advantages over classical predicate calculus and its derivatives. Moreover, semantic networks are con-venient for manual annotation because they are more intuitive.

MultiNet X  X  semantic representation of natural lan-guage is independent of the language being anno-tated. However, syntax obviously varies across lan-guages. To bridge the gap between different lan-guages we can the deep syntactico-semantic repre-sentation available in the Functional Generative De-scription framework. The main goals of the project are:  X  Test the completeness and intuitiveness of  X  Measure differences in semantic networks of  X  Enrich the Prague Dependency Treebank with  X  Provide data for supervised training of text-to- X  Test the extensibility of MultiNet to other lan-The presented tool has two key components de-scribed in this section. 3.1 Input/Output processing The input module of the tool loads XML files in Prague Markup Language (PML) and creates an in-ternal representation of the semantic network, tec-togrammatical layer, analytical layer, and the surface tion to use files with named entity annotations. The sentences in this demo are all annotated with named entities.

The XML schema for the semantic network is an application of the Prague Markup Language. 3.2 Network GUI The annotation GUI is implemented using Java Swing (Elliott et al., 2002). The key features of the tool presented in the demonstration are:  X  Editing links between the semantic network  X  Adding and removing nodes  X  Connecting nodes with directed edges  X  Connecting edges with directed edges (i.e., cre- X  Editing attributes of both nodes and edges  X  Undoing and redoing operations  X  Reusing concepts from previous sentences There are various tools for annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank. The Tred tool (Haji  X  c et al., 2001), for example, allows users to edit many PML applications, even those that have never been seen before. This functionality is enabled by roles in PML specification (Pajas and  X  St  X  ep  X  anek, 2005). MultiNet structures can be edited using MWR tool (Gnrlich, 2000), but this tool is not primarily intended for annotation; it serves more as an in-terface to tools automatically transforming German sentences into MultiNet.
