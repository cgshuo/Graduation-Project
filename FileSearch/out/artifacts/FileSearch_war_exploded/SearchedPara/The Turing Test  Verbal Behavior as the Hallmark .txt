 and to computer scientists more generally for his debate on the Loebner Turing Test competition, which appeared a decade earlier in Communications of the ACM (Shieber 1994a, 1994b; Loebner 1994). 1 With this collection, I expect it to become equally well known to philosophers.

A gift closes the book: a previously unpublished essay by Noam Chomsky,  X  X uring on the  X  X mitation Game. X  X  raises, and its significance. Shieber begins his introduction with an analogy that makes the Turing Test seem as clear and plausible as possible: Shieber observes that the  X  X ertinent property X  for  X  X ndistinguishability X  according to
Tu r i n g is  X  X erbal behavior X  (in the sense of spoken behavior). This phrase does not appear in Turing 1950;  X  X ehavio[u]r X  does, but it is not immediately obvious that it always means verbal behavior. The phrase brings to mind, of course, B. F. Skinner X  X  (1957) famous book of that name, though Shieber ascribes the notion to Descartes (page 4). Shieber does note that the two cases (meter-measuring and thinking) are not perfectly parallel: mind. (page 1) Test. (page 8) for intelligence? X  (page 8) or  X  ...for thinking X  (page 11), where  X  X ntelligence X  is to be understood as meaning  X  X eing capable of thought X  (page 6, note 2).

 (man X  X .e., human X  X achine), where Shieber shows that many of the responses to
Descartes were empirical attempts to build a machine that was indistinguishable (in relevant respects) from a living creature (e.g., de Vaucauson X  X  duck [page 39]). 408
Compare (at least one of) the goal(s) of modern artificial intelligence, namely, to build a machine that is indistinguishable (in relevant respects) from a living cognitive agent!
Shieber discusses La Mettrie X  X  extension of Descartes X  X  argument to the conclusion that, in fact, machines can be made indistinguishable from humans, since we humans are already nothing but machines. Shieber notes that it was only practical limitations of mechanics (e.g., those due to friction) that prevented further implementations, many of which limitations have now been transcended by modern electronics.
Obviously, many critics believe that there are theoretical limitations that will never be transcended, but I wonder if any physical limitations of contemporary electronic devices might someday be overcome in their turn by some new engineering tricks (such as optical or quantum computers?).

Here, he also raises  X  X he question of whether the Test is intended as reprinting and the original. Because of Shieber X  X  careful scholarly work, it seems to me that this reprint should become the standard version, possibly even superseding the original! radio interview that originally appeared shortly after Turing 1950. Shieber X  X  discussion focuses on the sidebar issues of when the test might be passed and on the role of gender.
On the former, Shieber takes issue with the famous understanding of Turing 1950 as having predicted passage by the year 2000; rather, all that Turing predicted would happen by then was passage of a weaker test. But one of the ephemera gives a figure of  X  X t least 100 years X  (pages 100, 119), that is, no earlier than 2050 (though this still seems somewhat optimistic to me, and I X  X  a fan both of  X  X trong AI X  and of the Turing Test). of man and woman in the original Imitation Game and whether they are essential in some way to the human X  X omputer Turing Test (with copious references to the literature on the topic), noting that the ephemera side with the non-gendered version.

This syllogism  X  X s implicitly assumed by all philosophers investigating the ramifi-the  X  X eaningless X  conclusion (pages 136 X 137). Shieber goes on to consider whether agents can pass the Turing Test does not follow from premises 1 X  4 because of the possibility of  X  X ncidental distinctions X  that might prevent an intelligent agent from passing (page 137). Shieber notes that French X  X  contribution argues that the Turing simpliciter (see below). As to whether the Test is a sufficient condition of thinking,
Shieber focuses on the circumstantial evidence cited in premise 3 as the weak link from a duck, then is it really a duck?). He notes that there is an easy counterexample to this premise: the celebrated case of the monkeys and the typewriter (an infinite number of monkeys working for an infinite amount of time eventually producing the complete works of Shakespeare). Other counterexamples can be found in Block X  X  and Searle X  X  contributions.
 results X  (pages 147, 154) are not enough to decide whether something can think, because there might be a property that is essential for thought that people, but not machines, a  X  X edge X  (page 148) driven between  X  X assing the Turing Test X  and  X  X eing capa-ble of thought. X  The essential property is a  X  X park X  that would otherwise cause the wedge to be able to think. Gunderson also argues that it is too easy to pass the Turing putational linguists have faced in their investigations of natural-language-processing tasks.
