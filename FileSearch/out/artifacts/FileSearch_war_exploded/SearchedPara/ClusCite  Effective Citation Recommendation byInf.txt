 Citation recommendation is an interesting but challenging research problem. Most existing studies assume that all pa-pers adopt the same criterion and follow the same behav-ioral pattern in deciding relevance and authority of a paper. However, in reality, papers have distinct citation behavioral patterns when looking for different references, depending on paper content, authors and target venues. In this study, we investigate the problem in the context of heterogenous bibliographic networks and propose a novel cluster-based ci-tation recommendation framework, called ClusCite , which explores the principle that citations tend to be softly clus-tered into interest groups based on multiple types of rela-tionships in the network. Therefore, we predict each query X  X  citations based on related interest groups, each having its own model for paper authority and relevance. Specifically, we learn group memberships for objects and the significance of relevance features for each interest group, while also prop-agating relative authority between objects, by solving a joint optimization problem. Experiments on both DBLP and PubMed datasets demonstrate the power of the proposed ap-proach, with 17.68% improvement in Recall@50 and 9.57% growth in MRR over the best performing baseline.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Citation Recommendation; Heterogeneous Information Net-work; Clustering; Citation Behavioral Pattern
A research paper needs to cite relevant and important previous work to help readers understand its background, context and innovation. However, the already large, and rapidly growing body of scientific literature makes it hard for anyone to go through and digest all the papers. It is thus Figure 1: A toy example showing the diverse in-for mation needs of two query manuscripts and the corresponding citation behavioral patterns. desirable to design a system that could automatically gener-ate quality citation recommendations. Traditional literature search engines, such as Google Scholar, can retrieve a list of relevant papers using keyword-based queries. But casting one X  X  rich information needs into a few keywords may not be feasible. Moreover, a user may be looking for papers that are not only relevant to their work, but also important and of high quality. To this end, citation recommendation aims to suggest a small number of publications that can be used as high quality references to satisfy such citation requirements.
There exist some interesting studies on citation recom-mendation. Context-aware recommendation [10, 12] ana-lyzes each citation X  X  local context to capture its specific in-formation needs. However, local context can be ambiguous or too short a query, causing inaccurate predictions. Top-ical similarity-based methods [18, 24] find conceptually re-lated papers by taking advantage of latent topic models. But solely relying on topic distributions to measure rele-vance is insufficient. A large number of papers may share the same topic, making topical similarity weak in indicating importance of a paper. Both methods primarily focus on recommending relevant papers based on content, but ignore critical information related to importance and quality.
Recent studies [16, 20] utilize citation links to derive struc-tural similarity and authority, which serve as good comple-ments to content-based relevance features. With paper text, authors and target venues as queries, one can further gen-erate a rich set of structural features [5, 27] based on mul-tiple types of relations between different entities. However, existing hybrid methods have difficulty in handling the di-verse information needs since they impose the same citation behavioral pattern on every query manuscript. Fig. 1 il-Figure 2: Schema for DBLP bibliographic network. lus trates the diversity of these behavioral patterns using a toy example. Paper I is on  X  X itation recommendation X  and  X  X ink prediction X , which are studied by a relatively compact group of researchers and venues, and one can find useful papers through related researchers, venues and key terms effectively. On the other hand, for  X  X andom walk X , relations through authors and venues would be less informative on pa-per relevance since this method is widely studied by authors working on a variety of topics, and published at venues focus-ing on a variety of fields. Previous hybrid methods learn and apply the same recommendation model across all queries, ignoring the variations in citation behaviors when seeking quality references. Intuitively, paper citations should be or-ganized into different groups and each group should have its own behavior pattern to identify information of interest.
In this paper, we propose a novel citation recommenda-tion framework to capture citation behaviors for each query manuscript, based on both paper relevance and importance. By softly clustering citations into different interest groups, we aim to study the significance of different relevance fea-tures for each interest group, and derive paper relative au-thority within each group. In doing so, the challenge of sat-isfying diverse information needs behind a paper X  X  citations can be properly tackled by making a paper-specific recom-mendation according to the query X  X  interest group member-ship. Meanwhile, integration of paper importance can be accurately accomplished using relative authority. This idea, though interesting, leads to two critical problems: (1) how to discover hidden interest groups for effective citation rec-ommendation, and (2) how to derive behavioral patterns on relevance and authority for each group.

To facilitate our study, a heterogenous bibliographic net-work, encoding the multiple types of relations between dif-ferent objects, is constructed (Fig. 2). A rich set of struc-tural features is derived from the network, representing var-ious relation semantics (Table 1) between two papers. We then formulate a joint optimization problem to learn the pro-posed model such that prediction error along with graph reg-ularization is minimized over known citations, based on the network. Specifically, the optimization problem conducts graph-regularized co-clustering to learn group membership for attribute objects and weights on relevance features for each group. It also propagates relative authority between different objects. An alternative minimization algorithm, called ClusCite , is further designed to iterate between co-clustering and authority propagation. Intuitively, feature weights and relative authority can be better learned with high quality interest groups, and in turn they assist in min-ing higher quality interest groups.

Our experiments on the DBLP and PubMed datasets dem-onstrate the power of the proposed model. ClusCite achieves 17.68% improvement in Recall@50 and 9.57% growth in MRR over the best baseline on the DBLP dataset. Our perfor-mance analysis shows that ClusCite can achieve even better results with richer attribute objects, and our case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of discovered interest groups and object relative authority for citation recommendation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 gives background and the problem definition. Sec. 3 introduces our new model. The learning algorithm and its computa-tio nal complexity analysis are in Sec. 4. We present and analyze our experimental results in Sec. 5, discuss the re-lated work in Sec. 6, and conclude this study in Sec. 7.
This section introduces concepts on heterogeneous biblio-graphic networks and presents the formal problem definition.
A heterogeneous bibliographic network [27, 23] is a directed graph G , that consists of multiple types of objects and relationships, derived from a bibliographic dataset. Suppose there are n papers P = { p 1 , . . . , p n } , |A| authors work. Citations between papers form a directed subgraph if paper p i cites paper p j and Y ij = 0 otherwise. For re-lationships between papers and authors, we use an undi-rected bipartite graph, denoted by a biadjacency matrix and R ( A ) ij = 0 otherwise. Similarly, the relationships between papers and venues can also be represented by a biadjacency the venue v j and R ( V ) ij = 0 otherwise. We extract a set of term objects T from the paper X  X  free-text and further con-struct an undirected bipartite subgraph between these terms and papers to represent paper content. We use the weight where R ( T ) ij is the term frequency of term e j in paper p
We adopt the concept of network schema to describe the heterogeneous bibliographic network at the meta level [22, 23]. An example is shown in Fig. 2.

As shown in [22, 27], meta path-based features in hetero-geneous information networks describe a rich set of relation semantics that can capture textual similarity, conceptual relevance and several kinds of social relatedness. A meta path is defined over network schema, where nodes are ob-ject types and edges are relation types. Table 1 shows some examples that use meta paths to measure paper relevance for the citation recommendation problem. Moreover, struc-tural similarity measures can be defined on each meta path to generate relevance features, as shown in [22, 27].
In general, we represent the meta path-based relevance score between p i and p j as  X  ( p i , p j ). Suppose we generate L different meta path-based relevance features by combining different meta paths with different structural similarity mea-meta path-based relevance score between p i and p j 1 .
In this work, we cast the citation recommendation prob-lem into the problem of learning a recommendation score function s ( q, p ) : Q X P 7 X  R for a query manuscript q  X  Q and a target paper p  X  P based on the heterogeneous bib-liographic network. The learned function is later used to
De t ails of the meta path-based similarity computation in heterogeneous bibliographic network can be found in [22]. compute scores between query and target papers to make a rec ommendation. Formally, we define the citation recom-mendation problem as follows.

Definition 1 (Problem Definition). Given a hetero-geneous bibliographic network G , and the terms, authors and target venues for a query manuscript q  X  X  , we aim to build a recommendation model specifically for q , and recommend a small subset of target papers p  X  X  as high quality references for q , by ranking the papers with the score function s ( q, p ) .
At a high level, the proposed cluster-based citation rec-ommendation framework consists of two major steps: 1. Learning the model parameters based on known citations 2. Making paper-specific recommendations for each query
We first provide an overview of the proposed model by defining the major components in the score function s ( q, p ).
Given a query manuscript q , its citations will focus on several interest groups each having its own behavioral pat-terns in finding relevant and high authority work (Fig. 1). It is desirable to recommend papers that are highly ranked in multiple interest groups of the query, since they best cap-ture diverse information needs. We propose a cluster-based score function to decide relative relevance and importance of target papers in the context of each interest group. It assigns a final recommendation score by integrating scores computed with respect to different interest groups.
Mathematically, suppose paper citations can be softly clus-tered into K interest groups, based on multiple types of rela-tionships between objects in the heterogeneous bibliographic network, then we define the score function s ( q, p ) as follows:
Function s ( q, p ) measures how likely a query manuscript q  X  X  is to cite a target paper p  X  X  . It is decomposed into a set of cluster-based functions: the cluster-based relevance function r ( k ) ( q, p ) : Q X P 7 X  R measures the relatedness be-tween q and p according to the k -th interest group, and pa-per relative authority function f ( k ) P ( p ) : P 7 X  R computes the relative importance of p within the k -th interest group. The weighted combination of these functions defines the final rec-ommendation score with respect to the group membership likely query q is to belong to the K different interest groups.
As mentioned in Sec. 2, one can compute a rich set of meta path-based features to describe paper relevance under vari-ous relation semantics. Each meta path-based feature, could play a distinct role in identifying relevant work in different interest groups.

In Fig. 1, incorporating meta path P  X  V  X  P along with textual similarity P  X  T  X  P can effectively suggest related pa-pers under the interest  X  X ink prediction (problem) X  because only a compact set of venues ( e.g. , KDD, ICML and ICDM) Table 2: Learned weights on seven different meta paths for four mined interest groups ( K = 40 ).
 study this problem. However, if the interest switches to  X  X -BFG S (algorithm) X , using P  X  V  X  P probably will hurt the results since a much broarder set of venues involve studying this algorithm, and thus, sharing a venue with the query provides very weak evidence for paper relevance.

In order to capture the biased significance of different rele-vance features for different interest groups, we assign feature weights for each interest group individually, leading to the definition of a cluster-based relevance function as follows:
For each interest group k , we use a set of weights { w ( l ) k &gt; 0 } to measure the significance of the L different meta path-based features {  X  ( l ) ( q, p ) } for the group.
These K feature weights are estimated through a joint optimization problem (Sec. 4). We demonstrate in Table 2 the learned feature patterns over 7 meta paths for 4 example interest groups (* and ** highlight first and second most significant values), using the random walk-based similarity measure on DBLP. All 4 groups show distinct weights on the 7 meta paths, justifying the claim that different interest groups hold different feature weights. In particular, we find meta paths which impose textual similarity ( e.g. , P  X  T  X  P  X  play critical roles in finding relevant papers in these 4 groups, which matches human intuitions very well.
A paper may have very different visibility or authority among different interest groups even if it has many citations. In the DBLP dataset [25], paper ObjectRank [3] (132 cita-tions) got 47 citations from VLDB but only 12 from WWW , while RankSVM [14] (250 citations) obtained only 27 cita-tions from VLDB but 109 from WWW , implying the bias of authority in different interest groups.

Instead of learning object X  X  group membership and de-riving relative authority separately, we propose to estimate them jointly using graph regularization, which preserves con-sistency over each subgraph. By doing so, paper relative authority serves as a feature for learning interest groups, and better estimated groups can in turn help derive relative authority more accurately (Fig. 3).

We adopt the semi-supervised learning framework [8] that leads to iteratively updating rules as authority propagation between different types of objects.

We denote relative authority score matrices for paper, au-portance of one type of object could be a combination of the relative importance from different types of objects [23].
In our solution, the propagation function G P upd ates pa-per relative authority scores for all groups, following the in-tuition: High quality papers from an interest group are often published in highly reputed venues, written by authoritative authors and related to other high quality papers, from this group. Trade-off parameters  X  A and  X  V control the relative importance of paper-author and paper-venue relations. On the other hand, propagation functions G A and G V capture the rules: highly regarded authors often write good qual-ity papers, and highly reputed venues often publish good quality papers. We include detailed formulae for the three propagation functions in Sec. 4.
In practice, to derive interest group memberships for newly emerged queries, one has to re-estimate the model using these queries and training data, which is highly inefficient. Moreover, as the number of papers grows rapidly, the size of the model parameter space will increase a lot, making the model learning even more unscalable.

To tackle these two challenges, we leverage group member-ships of the query X  X  related attribute objects, i.e. , authors, terms and target venues, to approximately represent group membership of the query manuscript.

Intuitively, terms of the query manuscript describe its in-formation needs based on paper content, whereas its au-thor(s) and venue complement the content with research in-terests and other conceptual information. Specifically, we represent the query X  X  group membership  X  ( k ) q by weighted integration of group memberships of its attribute objects.
W e use N X ( q ) to denote type X neighbors for query q , i.e. , its attribute objects. How likely a type X object is to belong to the k -th interest group is represented by  X  ( k )
Paper-specific citation recommendation can be efficiently conducted for each query manuscript q by applying Eq. (1) along with definitions in Eqs. (2), (3) and (4).
This section introduces the learning algorithm for the pro-posed citation recommendation model in Eq. (1).

There are three sets of parameters in our model: group memberships for attribute objects; feature weights for inter-est groups; and object relative authority within each inter-est group. A straightforward way is to first conduct hard-clustering of attribute objects based on the network and then derive feature weights and relative authority for each cluster. Such a solution encounters several problems: (1) one object may have multiple citation interests, (2) mined object clusters may not properly capture distinct citation interests as we want, and (3) model performance may not be best optimized by the mined clusters.

In our solution, we formulate a joint optimization prob-lem to estimate all model parameters simultaneously, which minimizes prediction error as well as graph regularization. By doing so, we can softly cluster attribute objects in terms of their citation interests and guarantee the learned model can yield good performance on training data.

We explain the joint optimization problem in Sec. 4.1 and design an efficient algorithm to solve it in Sec. 4.2 along with its computational complexity analysis in Sec. 4.3.
To learn model parameters, we use a citation network as training data, where value 1 indicates observed citation re-lationships while value 0 represents a mixture of negatives (should not cite) or unobserved (unaware and may cite in the future) examples. Traditional learning methods adopt classification [27] or learning-to-rank [1] objective functions and usually treat all 0s in training data as negative exam-ples, which does not fit the real cases.

Without loss of generality, we adopts weighted square er-ror [11] on the citation matrix as the loss function to measure the prediction performance, which is defined as follows:
L = citation matrix, where M ij takes value 1 if the citation rela-tionship between p i and p j is observed and 0 in other cases. By doing so, the model can focus on positive examples and get rid of noise in the 0 values. One can also define other loss functions to optimize with respect to precision or recall.
For ease of optimization, the loss can be further rewrit-group membership indicator for all attribute objects while Fea ture weights for each interest group are represented by product  X  is used for the matrix element-wise product.
As discussed in Sec. 3.3, to achieve authority learning jointly, we adopt graph regularization to preserve consis-tency over the paper-author and paper-venue subgraphs, which takes the following form:
The intuition behind the above two terms is natural: Linked objects in the heterogeneous network are more likely to share similar relative authority scores [13]. To reduce impact of node popularity, we apply a normalization technique on au-thority vectors, which helps suppress popular objects to keep them from dominating the authority propagation. Each Integrating the loss in Eq. (5) with graph regularization in Eq. (6), we formulate a joint optimization problem following the semi-supervised learning framework [8]:
To ensure stability of the obtained solution, Tikhonov reg-ularizers are imposed on variables P and W [4], and we use c , c w &gt; 0 to control the strength of regularization. In ad-dition, we impose non-negativity constraints to make sure learned group membership indicators and feature weights can provide semantic meaning as we want.
Directly solving Eq (7) is not easy because the objective function is non-convex. We develop an alternative mini-mization algorithm, called ClusCite , which alternatively optimizes the problem with respect to each variable.
The learning algorithm essentially accomplishes two things simultaneously and iteratively: Co-clustering of attribute objects and relevance features with respect to interest groups, and authority propagation between different objects. Dur-ing an iteration, different learning components will mutually enhance each other (Fig. 3): Feature weights and relative authority can be more accurately derived with high quality interest groups while in turn they serve a good feature for learning high quality interest groups.

First, to learn group membership for attribute objects, we take the derivative of the objective function in Eq. (7) with respect to P while fixing other variables, and apply the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker complementary condition to im-pose the non-negativity constraint [7]. With some simple algebraic operations, a multiplicative update formula for P can be derived as follows: where matrices L P 0 , L P 1 and L P 2 are defined as follows: L L In order to preserve non-negativity throughout the update,
P 2 into L  X  P 2 and L + P 2 , but note that the decomposition is applied to each of the three components of L P 2 , respectively. We denote the masked Y i as  X  Y i , which is the Hadamard
Second, to learn feature weights for interest groups, the multiplicative update formula for W can be derived follow-ing a similar derivation as that of P , taking the form:
Similarly, to preserve non-negativity of W , L W is decom-posed into L + W and L  X  W , which can be computed same be-fore.
 Finally, we derive the authority propagation functions in Eq. (3) by optimizing the objective function in Eq. (7) with respect to the authority score matrices of papers, authors Figure 3: Correlation between paper relative au-tho rity and # ground truth citations, during differ-ent iterations. and venues. Specifically, we take the derivative of the ob-jective function with respect to F P , F A and F V , and follow traditional semi-supervised learning frameworks [8] to derive the update rules, which take the form: where we have normalized adjacency matrices and the paper authority guidance terms defined as follows:
Using normalized adjacency matrices S A and S V to prop-agate relative authority can suppress popular objects in the network. In this way, they will not dominate the author-ity propagation. At each iteration, the guidance term L F adjusts paper relative authority such that the model can fit known citations in a more accurate way.

Algorithm 1 summarizes the ClusCite algorithm. For con-vergence analysis, ClusCite essentially applies block coordi-nate descent on the optimization problem in Eq. (7). The proof procedure in [26] can be adopted to prove convergence for ClusCite (to the local minimum). For lack of space, we do not include it here.

Fig. 3 illustrates the quality change of estimated paper rel-ative authority. Given an interest group, citations from test set to training papers serve as our ground truth for the rel-ative authority of this group. We study the change of corre-lation between estimated relative authority and the ground truth, during different iterations. The initialization (global citation count) shows poor quality based on the correlation. As the algorithm iterates, we observe significant enhance-ment on the correlation, which justifies the effectiveness of the proposed authority propagation approach.
In this section, we analyze the computational complex-ity of the proposed ClusCite algorithm. Let d denote the total number of attribute objects and | E | the total num-ber of links in the heterogeneous network. First, it takes O ( K ( n + d )) time to initialize all the variables and O ( | E | L ) time to pre-compute the constants in the update formula. In addition, we apply the fact that: P n A n XB n = C is mentation so that we can avoid summations over all papers by pre-computing several matrix Kronecker products ( N ). This step takes totally O ( L 2 | E | 2 /n + L | E | 3 /n We then study the time complexity at each iteration of ClusCite with pre-computed matrices.

(9) takes O ( L | E | 3 /n 3 + L 2 | E | 2 /n 2 + Kdn ) time. Updating all three relative authority matrices takes O ( L | E | 3 /n 3 Kdn ) time. Let the number of iterations to compute Clus-Cite be T ( T  X  n ). The total time complexity is O ( L | E | L | E | 2 /n + T | E | + T Kdn ). In our experiments, ClusCite usually converges within 50 iterations.
In this section, we evaluate the recommendation perfor-mance of the proposed method on real world data and con-duct case studies to demonstrate its effectiveness.
In the experiments, two different bibliographic datasets are used: the DBLP dataset 2 [25] and the PubMed dataset 3 Statistics of the two constructed heterogeneous bibliographic networks are summarized in Table 3. Tang et al. [25] extracted citation information and built a DBLP citation dataset. We generated a subset of the afore-mentioned dataset by filtering out papers with incomplete meta information or less than 5 citations. Keywords and key phrases are extracted from paper titles and abstracts using the TF-IDF measure and the TextBlob noun phrase extrac-tor 4 . The PubMed Central dataset is processed by the same method as described above to generate a subset 5 . We con-verted both datasets into heterogeneous bibliographic net-works according to the network schema in Fig. 2.
We split the network to generate training, validation and testing subsets according to the paper publication year. We considered three time intervals T 0 , T 1 and T 2 . The sub-network associated with papers in T 0 was used for model training. Papers in T 1 were then used as the validation set for parameter tuning and papers in T 2 were used as the test set for evaluations. Tables 4(a) and 4(b) summarize the statistics of the subsets. During evaluation, we consider ci-tations from the evaluation sets ( T 1 and T 2 ) to the training htt p://arnetminer.org/DBLP_Citation http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ https://github.com/shanzhenren2/PubMed_subset Table 3: Statistics of two bibliographic networks. Table 4: Training, validation and testing paper sub-set s from the DBLP and PubMed datasets set ( T 0 ) as the ground truth. Such an evaluation practice is more realistic because a citation recommendation system only knows the related attribute objects of a newly writ-ten manuscript. Also, it predicts future citations based on models which are learned from past citations.
In the experiments, without loss of generality, we selected 15 different meta-paths between paper objects including ( P  X  X  X  P ) y , P  X  X  X  P  X  P and P  X  X  X  P  X  P where X = { A, V, T } and y = { 1 , 2 , 3 } . Note that ( P  X  X  X  P ) denotes P  X  X  X  P  X  X  X  P . We used two different structural similarity measures: PathSim [22] measure and the random-walk based measure [27]. We applied the random-walk based measure to all meta-paths and the PathSim measure to only symmetric meta-paths due to its requirement. This provides us with 24 meta-path based relevance features. Note that all the  X  X ited X  and  X  X iting X  relations in the meta-paths were only measured between papers in the training set.
We provide details on the experimental settings for con-ducting evaluations on all the methods.
We compared the proposed method (ClusCite) with its variation which considered only relevance features (ClusCite-Rel). Several widely deployed or state-of-the-art citation recommendation approaches were also implemented, includ-ing content-based methods, link-based methods and hybrid methods. All compared methods were first tuned on valida-tion set to pick the tuning parameters.

BM25: BM25 is a text-based method, which computes similarity scores using only text information.

PopRank [19]: PopRank is a link-based method which derives an object X  X  importance based on authority propaga-tion in the heterogeneous bibliographic network.

TopicSim: We measure similarity between papers with topic modeling technique (LDA) and return the papers with the most similar topic distribution compared with the query.
Link-PLSA-LDA [18]: Link-PLSA-LDA 6 is a hybrid method that leverages both document text and citation links ht t ps://sites.google.com/site/rameshnallapati/ software Fig ure 4: Performance comparisons measured by Recall and Precision at different positions. when modeling topics. The candidates were ranked in terms of the conditional probability of citations from the query manuscript to the candidate papers.

L2-LR [27]: This technique changes the problem into classification with a linearly weighted combination of meta path-based relevance features. Positive examples are ob-served citations and negative examples are randomly sam-pled paper pairs.

RankSVM [14]: RankSVM considers the preference be-tween paper-paper relationships, instead of assuming all un-observed relationships are negative examples.

MixFea: the candidates were ranked by a linear com-bination of meta path-based relevance features, topic dis-tributions and PopRank X  X  features. We used RankSVM to estimate feature weights.

ClusCite: candidates were ranked based on the scores computed by Eq. (1). We set the number of interest groups K = 200, c p = 10  X  6 , c w = 10  X  7 ,  X  A =  X  V = 0 . 3 after tuning them on validation sets (Fig. 5 and Sec. 5.6).
ClusCite-Rel: candidates were ranked based on the pro-posed model with only meta path-based relevance features, i.e. , by dropping F P in Eq. (1). It used the same settings on K , c p and c w as those of ClusCite.
We employed Precision and Recall at position M (P@ M and R@ M ) as the evaluation metrics. Recall@ M is de-fined as the percentage of original citing papers that ap-pear in the top-M recommended list. A high recall with a lower M indicates a better citation recommendation system. Precision@ M was also used to measure the effectiveness of the recommendation system by checking whether the origi-nal citing papers were ranked high for the query manuscript.
Furthermore, it is desirable that ground truth papers should appear earlier in the top-M recommended list. Therefore, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) was also employed over the target papers, which is defined as MRR = 1 |Q wh e re Q T is the testing set and rank( q ) denotes the rank of its first ground truth paper (positive example).
We now compare the proposed recommendation model (ClusCite) with its variation (ClusCite-Rel) and other base-lines in terms of the citation recommendation performance.
First, we compare the proposed methods with seven dif-ferent baselines using Precision@10 , 20, Recall@20 , 50 and MRR. Table 5 summarizes the comparison results on both DBLP and PubMed datasets. Overall, the proposed Clus-Cite method and its variation ClusCite-Rel outperform other methods on all metrics. In particular, ClusCite obtains a 17.68% improvement in Recall@50 and 9.57% improvement in MRR compared to the best baseline on the DBLP dataset. On the PubMed dataset, it improves Recall@20 by 20.19% and MRR by 14.79% compared to MixFea. Even though MixFea has incorporated a rich set of features, ClusCite ob-tained superior performance because it not only explores citation behaviors by learning group-based feature weights over different relation semantics, but also integrates relative paper authority to augment the recommendation process.
The ClusCite-Rel method outperforms all other baselines and improves Recall@50 by 10.42% compared to the best baseline, MixFea, on the DBLP dataset. Comparing ClusCite-Rel with methods such as RankSVM and L2-LR, one can clearly notice the performance gain from distinguishing rel-evance feature weights for different interest groups. Clus-Cite always outperforms ClusCite-Rel, improving MRR by 12.21% and Recall@50 by 6.57% on the DBLP dataset. The enhancement mainly comes from utilizing paper relative au-thority with respect to different interest groups. Also, the derived relative authority can assist recommendation since it is jointly learned through the unified optimization.
MixFea is another method that incorporates paper au-thority information, but it does not distinguish paper au-thority in different interest groups. However, it still obtained better results than RankSVM and L2-LR did in most cases. This demonstrates the effectiveness of paper authority in-formation in the citation recommendation process. Further-more, poor performance of PopRank shows that using only global authority is not sufficient to conduct good citation recommendation. Different from the conclusions in [10], We found that Link-PLSA-LDA and TopicSim can only achieve 0.0893 and 0.0273 for Precision@20 (compared to 0.1677 with L2-LR), respectively. Also, BM25 outperformed both of the topic-based methods in all cases. This shows that topic-based features are not good enough for finding rele-vant papers, since the features may be of coarse granularity.
For more comprehensive comparisons, we computed the precision and recall at different positions (5 to 100) to study the trends in performance changes. Due to space limits, Fig. 4 only shows the comparison results of Recall on DBLP and comparison results of Precision on PubMed, respec-Fig ure 5: Performance change (Recall @50 ) on val-idation sets, with respect to number of interest groups ( K ) (MixFea as baseline). tively. For both precision and recall, the performance gap between ClusCite and ClusCite-Rel gets slightly larger as more candidates are returned. This indicates that authority information played a critical role in identifying papers with moderate relevance to the query (people may cite relevant papers even though they are new and less reputed, but they prefer authoritative ones among the less relevant papers). In this section, we analyze the performance of ClusCite, ClusCite-Rel and MixFea in different recommendation sce-narios. We ran the following experiments on both datasets and observed similar performance changes in both. How-ever, in the interest of brevity, we only present results from the PubMed dataset for some analyses.

First, we studied performance change with respect to the number of interest groups for ClusCite and ClusCite-Rel. As presented in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b), although not very sensi-tive to K , these two methods did perform differently when the number of groups were varied. Also, the performance changes were more notable at smaller K , i.e. K &lt; 100. This indicates that the proposed methods cannot determine cita-tion behavior well when the number of groups is small. On the other hand, a large K ( e.g. K &gt; 300) caused a perfor-mance drop due to the insufficiency of training data in de-riving interest groups. We found that ClusCite achieved the best performance when the number of groups was K = 200 while ClusCite-Rel obtained the best performance with a large number K = 300. This shows that biomedical domain has more diverse citation behavior patterns.

In ClusCite and ClusCite-Rel, the paper-specific recom-mendation makes a prediction for a query based on its at-tribute objects. Therefore, we want to examine their perfor-mance change by studying the correlation between recom-mendations of the two proposed methods and the number of attribute objects in the query manuscript. We divided the test set into 6 groups with respect to the number of attribute objects. The resulting query groups had an average num-ber of attribute objects ranging from 6 . 46 (group 1) to 18 . 98 (group 6). The results by MRR are summarized in Fig. 6(a). Overall, ClusCite outperformed ClusCite-Rel, and both out-performed MixFea. The proposed methods achieved a larger performance improvement when the number of attribute ob-jects increased ( e.g. from 0.02 in group 1 to 0.08 in group 6) while the performance of MixFea seemed less sensitive be-tween different query groups. This demonstrates that with more attribute objects provided by the query manuscript, the proposed method can make better paper-specific recom-mendations because richer attribute objects provide better estimation on group membership of the query manuscript.
Finally, we tested the model generalization by evaluat-ing performance on test papers from different time periods. We generated four test subsets using papers in T 2 of the Fig ure 6: Performance change with number of at-tribute objects and time periods of query papers. PubMed dataset where each subset consists of papers from one specific year. By applying the methods on each subset, we want to study how the model, learned from papers in T , can predict citations for future papers. The study re-sults are shown in Fig. 6(b). Overall, the performance of both methods dropped when recommending for newer pa-pers but ClusCite always outperformed MixFea. Recall@50 of MixFea decreased by 16.42% from year 2010 to 2013 while Recall@50 of ClusCite dropped only about 7.72%, which in-dicates the better generalization of the proposed method.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of mining hidden interest groups, we conduct two sets of case studies on the DBLP dataset to show citation behavioral patterns (Fig. 7) and relative authority ranking of authors and venues, (Table 6) within an example of mined interest groups.

First, we show that the learned interest groups have dis-tinct citation behavioral patterns and can satisfy different information needs. We apply K-means clustering on all ob-jects X  group membership indicators and derive their most likely groups (we set K = 40). Two representative groups were picked where group A contained 8,345 papers and 208 venues and group B contained 10,922 papers and 291 venues. We found that major venues in group A were database venues ( e.g. ,  X  X IGMOD X  and  X  X LDB X ) and those in group B were computer vision venues ( e.g. ,  X  X PAMI X  and  X  X JCV X ). To study how the four venues were cited by papers in the two interest groups, we calculated the average number of cita-tions from papers in group A and B to the four venues, respectively. The results are in Fig. 7(a). One can see that papers in group A prefer to cite database papers while those in group B cite computer vision papers more frequently.
Following a similar procedure, we selected two more repre-sentative groups and studied their papers X  citations on four different authors: data mining researchers  X  X illip S. Yu X  X nd  X  X akesh Agrawal X  from group A and programming language researchers  X  X homas W. Reps X  and  X  X en Kenndedy X  from group B. The average number of citations for these four au-thors are summarized in Fig. 7(b). Similar behavioral pat-terns were observed that papers in group A cite data mining researchers more frequently while papers in group B pre-fer programming language researchers. The derived interest groups show two different behavioral patterns on citations, and justify that they can capture different citation interests.
Second, we study the effectiveness of the relative authority propagation process in the proposed ClusCite algorithm. By setting the number of interest groups as K = 40, we apply ClusCite on the training data and obtain relative authority scores for authors ( F A ) and venues ( F V ). We can list the top ranked objects based on their relative authority scores within different interest groups. Table 6 shows the ranked lists for two example interest groups. One can easily identify (a) Citations on venues Fig ure 7: Case studies on citation behavioral pat-terns among different interest groups. We show the averaged number of citations on four venues and four authors, for two groups of papers. the research areas that these two interest groups belong to: Group I is on database and information system while Group II is on computer vision and multimedia. There is a high degree of consensus between the ranking list generated by ClusCite and the top venues and reputed authors in each research area. This demonstrates that the relative authority propagation can generate meaningful authority scores with respect to different interest groups.
 Table 6: Top-5 authority venues and authors from two example interest groups derived by ClusCite.

In t his section, we study the impact of four parameters: c and c w in ClusCite and ClusCite-Rel, and  X  A and  X  V in ClusCite, on validation sets. The number of interest groups are set as K = 200. MixFea, the best baseline, is the only one used here. For conciseness, only DBLP dataset results are presented in Fig. 8, where the x-axes are in log scale.
In the joint optimization problem in Eq. (7), c p and c w control the strength of Tikhonov regularizers on group mem-bership indicators and relevance feature weights. A larger value imposes a higher penalty on the magnitude of variable values. We vary one of these two parameters while fixing the other as zero. For ClusCite, we set  X  A =  X  V = 0 . 1. Both ClusCite and ClusCite-Rel show robust performance over a large range of c w (Fig. 8(a)) and achieve significant improve-ment compared to MixFea. We observe a similar trend when varying c w (Fig. 8(b)) but ClusCite performs slightly better when c w = 10  X  7 . Such changes are because W plays a role in balancing relevance and authority scores for the ClusCite model while scaling of P will not affect the ranking results.
ClusCite has two more parameters  X  A and  X  V , which control relative importance of authority information from authors and venues, respectively. By setting one to zero and varying the other, we aim to see a performance change when only one information source is utilized in the author-ity propagation process. Using ClusCite-Rel and MixFea as baselines, one can see that both information sources help improve the performance of ClusCite significantly. ClusCite achieves the best performance when  X  A = 0 . 3 (Fig. 8(c)) and  X  V = 0 . 3 (Fig. 8(d)). In particular, we found that ap-plying venue information to authority propagation led to better results.
Existing work leverages different kinds of information to recommend citations for a query manuscript, from paper content, known citations to authors and venues of a paper.
Traditional keyword-based approaches have difficulty in finding conceptually similar work due to the ambiguity of short-text queries [20, 5]. One can notice that the perfor-mance of BM25 in our experiments is much worse than those of the hybrid methods like L2-LR. Using citation local con-texts, i.e. , text surrounding the citation positions, context-based methods can capture diverse information needs more precisely [24, 10, 12]. However, the local context might be irrelevant to the ideas of cited paper. Moreover, picking the size of each context window is non-trivial. Also, it will be interesting to study different intents and purposes behind the citation contexts to leverage them more accurately.
On the other hand, known citations can be used to mea-sure paper structural similarity. Traditional link prediction techniques [16, 2] and collaborative filtering techniques [11] encounter cold-start issue since in practice little or no ci-tations are provided for query manuscript. Heterogenous link prediction techniques [17, 6] tackle this issue by taking advantages of multiple types of relationships between pa-pers, authors and venues. However, these link-based meth-ods cannot achieve satisfactory results without considering content-based features. Therefore, recent studies start inte-grating both content and structure information to augment the performance [20]. Latent topic models are used to pre-dict citations for new documents by modeling citation links jointly[18, 24]. However, topical similarity may be too coarse to serve as good evidence for citation prediction and ex-perimental results on TopicSim and Link-PLSA-LDA show their limited performance. Yu et al. [27] derive a rich set of meta-path based features from heterogeneous bibliographic networks in modeling citation recommendation, which can capture text-based similarity, conceptual relevance as well as several types of social relatedness.

Aforementioned methods consider only paper relevance but ignore another critical information for citation recom-mendation, namely the importance and quality of target pa-pers [20]. Bethard and Jurafsky [5] built a literature search system by learning a linearly weighted model over both rel-evance and authority features.

Our work considers diverse citation interests by imposing different feature patternsaccording to the interest groups of each query (see comparisons between ClusCite-Rel and L2-LR [27]). Yu et al. [28] study personalized entity recommen-dation, which shares the similar idea of building local re-trieval model for each cluster specifically. Our work is also related to [5] in terms of incorporating paper authority, but we derive paper relative authority within each group specif-ically (see comparisons between ClusCite and MixFea).
Ranking objects on graphs by their importance and pop-ularity has been extensively studied [15, 19] and combined with keyword search system [3]. In particular, Sun and parameters c p and c w for both methods, and  X  A and  X  V for ClusCite. MixFea is used as a baseline.
 Giles [21] consider both citation impacts as well as venue influence when propagating paper authority scores in bibli-ographic networks. With ranking supervision, graph-based semi-supervised ranking frameworks can be further applied[1, 8]. However, these methods do not capture the bias of au-thority when topics or interests of the query change. (see comparison between PopRank [19] and ClusCite)
Haveliwala [9] personalizes the PageRank algorithm by considering query topics to derive query-specific authority score. Similar ideas were explored when performing cluster-ing [23] and classification [13] in heterogeneous information networks, where object relative authority served as features for representing classes. To our best knowledge, the pro-posed method is the first to learn object relative author-ity through optimizing the citation recommendation model, based on multiple types of relationships in heterogeneous bibliographic networks.
In this paper, we study citation recommendation in the context of heterogeneous bibliographic networks and pro-pose a novel cluster-based citation recommendation frame-work to satisfy a user X  X  diverse citation intents. By orga-nizing paper citations into interest groups, the proposed method is able to determine the significance of different structural relevance features for each group, and derive pa-per X  X  relative authority within each group. In this way, we can make paper-specific recommendations to capture each query X  X  diverse information needs. We formulate a joint optimization problem to learn model parameters by taking advantage of multiple relationships in the network, and de-velop an efficient algorithm to solve it. Performance eval-uation results show a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods and the case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Interesting future work includes extending the proposed clustering-based recommendation framework for Web search tasks or entity recommendation so that one can capture local relevance and authority jointly. In addition, there is poten-tial to adjust the network structure for each interest group so that relative authority can more accurately propagate within the corresponding sub-networks. Finally, one can integrate object authority information with each meta path instance to design novel features for citation recommendation.
