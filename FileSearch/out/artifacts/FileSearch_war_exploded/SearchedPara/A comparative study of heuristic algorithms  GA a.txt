 1. Introduction
Recent advances in wireless communication lead to the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communication systems employing simultaneous use of antenna arrays at both the transmitter and the receiver ( Barbarossa, 2005; Tse and Viswanath, 2005 ). The MIMO architecture exploits multipath propagation to improve the link capacity by establishing multiple parallel channels operating simultaneously in the same frequency band and at the same transmitted power. In contrast to the logarithmic bandwidth efficiency growth obtained with single antenna systems, the capacity growth for MIMO systems is linearly related with the number of antennas. An information theoretic analysis on the capacity of MIMO systems was presented in Telatar (1999) assuming flat, quasi-static and spatially inde-pendent Rayleigh fading environment with known channel state information at the receiver. The study concluded that the capacity of multiple antenna channels increases linearly with the smaller of the number of transmit and the receive antennas.

The received signal at a particular receive antenna of a MIMO system is a superimposed representation of the signals trans-mitted from the multiple transmit antennas. If the MIMO system has N transmit antennas and uses a signal constellation X of size space and subsequently weeds out the poor solutions based on competitive selection. The population size should be carefully selected because it directly effects the computation time and the optimality achieved. This is followed by the processes of recombination and mutation to generate a new set of probable solutions (offspring) replacing the discarded poor parents. The new set of offspring is biased and directs the search mechanism towards the regions of the search space for which good solutions are already observed. This improves the quality of the output generated after each iteration of the search method. While searching for the optimal solution in time sensitive applications the EAs are desired to achieve satisfactory performance within a reduced number of iterations.

Unlike EAs the EDAs do not use crossover or mutation operators, considered primary tools for GA based optimization.
Instead, EDAs explicitly extract global statistical information from the selected solutions and subsequently build a probability model of promising solutions based on the extracted information. New solutions are sampled from the model thus built. In this paper univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) from the family of EDAs is chosen and the performance of the algorithm is analyzed as a MIMO decoder. A comparison of the BER performance of UMDA with the BER performance of GA is also provided in the simulation results.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the spatial multiplexed system model and sets-up the MIMO detection problem for flat, quasi-static and spatially independent
Rayleigh fading environment. A brief overview of existing MIMO detectors is given in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 detail the MIMO detection based on GA and UMDA, respectively. BER performance analysis of the proposed detectors is discussed in Section 6 followed by the conclusion. 2. The system model
We consider an M N MIMO channel (i.e. there are N transmit antennas and M Z N receive antennas), and a spatial multiplexing system such as VBLAST ( Foschini, 1996 ). At each time instant, the linear baseband system model as shown in Fig. 1 is given by y  X  Hx  X  Z  X  1  X  with the data vector x  X  X  x 1 ; ... ; x N T A C N , the M N channel matrix H and y  X  X  y 1 ; ... ; y M T A C M represents the received signal vector. The additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is represented by Z A C M having circularly symmetric complex Gaussian components. The data symbols x n A x are assumed to be zero mean and white with variance s x . The noise components Z m A Z are independent and circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variables with variance s Z . Each element of x is determined from the same set X composed of B  X  2 b constellation points where b is the number of bits per symbol.
The channel matrix coefficients are i.i.d. Rayleigh random variables h mn representing the channel between the n th transmit antenna and the m th receive antenna. The receiver is assumed to have full knowledge of the channel coefficients. This is a reasonable assumption when the fading is slow enough to allow estimation of the channel state information with negligible error, as in the case of fixed wireless systems. set of chromosomes that form a pool of symbol vectors called the initial population. An initial guess is also included in this pool of probable solutions from the output of the VBLAST detector. This not only gives an initial boost but also accelerates the search mechanism. Each member of the population is evaluated for its fitness and is accordingly assigned a probability to be selected for reproduction. The cost function to evaluate the fitness of each chromosome is the calculation of the Euclidean norm given by f  X  J y Hx J 2  X  3  X  The best chromosome in a generation will have the least value of the objective function representing the Euclidean distance of the transformed symbol vector x from the received signal y, the channel matrix H represents the transformation parameters. A chromosome is carried to the next generation if its counterpart in the previous generation had a larger fitness. This operation ensures that at least the useful information contained in the present generation is passed on to the next.

The population size is represented by N pop , the population carried to the next generation is N keep  X  N pop P sel and N pop N keep chromosomes are discarded to make room for the offspring. Deciding how many chromosomes to keep is arbitrary and normally the chromosomes have been sorted by cost. This new population of N keep chromosomes forms a mating pool of good parents. The step is intended to replace the chromosome with largest objective function value by the best chromosome of the same generation. The offspring to replace the bad parents is created by the processes of crossover and mutation . The crossover operation is applied to the pairs of selected parents and creates offspring. This process of mating creates two offspring by combining subparts of the bit strings representing the two selected parents. The crossover point is randomly chosen along the chromosome X  X  length and portions up to that point are exchanged between two parents. Probability of crossover P c is user controlled and is usually set to a high value. The offspring thus formed undergo the mutation process and new members for the next generation are produced. The mutation operator simply alters each bit of the binary chromosome randomly with a user controlled probability P m . Generally, the crossover probability P c is assigned a value close to 1 and the mutation probability P m is kept close to 0.
The new individuals replace members of the previous popula-tions with worst fitness values. The algorithm iterates until the optimization of the objective function is achieved or the termination criterion defined by the user is satisfied. For a given pre-defined number of generations and the population size, the computation time of Eq. (3) varies linearly with N pop N gen for GA based detector. The algorithm terminates execution and generates the output when the pre-defined optimality criterion is met. Otherwise, further refining of solution is done by producing a next generation. 5. Estimation of distribution algorithms 5.1. General
Estimation of distribution algorithms can be regarded as the probabilistic approaches designed on the working principles of EAs. They have been proposed in a wide variety of scenarios with the purpose of overcoming some of the drawbacks that classical EAs present. Concretely, the most appealing advantage of EDAs over classical EAs is the reduction in the number of parameters to be tuned or assessed by the user. This reduction in the number of parameters stems from the non-existence of random operators needed to generate the next population. EDAs replace the application of random operators (crossover and mutation) by set of values is evaluated as 1. Define the chromosome length B  X  2 b in the parameter space. It represents the search space bits for the MIMO detection problem. 2. Randomly initialize the population along with an initial guess from VBLAST and sort it according to the fitness of the chromosomes given by Eq. (3). The population size should be carefully selected as it is directly associated with the computational complexity of the algorithm and the degree of refinement of the solution. The algorithm may be tuned to find an appropriate value for the population size as discussed in Section 6. 3. Find the selected population of N sel chromosomes based on
P sel ; contains the better chromosomes of the population found in step 2. 4. Represent each bit position i A f 1 ; ... ; B g along the chromo-some length by a random variable X i , possible values the random variable can take is given by b i A f 0 ; 1 g for the binary representation. 5. If x  X  X  b 1 ; ... ; b B is the binary representation of a chromosome x, then the univariate marginal distribution is given by
P  X  X i  X  b i  X  . For the simulation results to follow the univariate marginal distribution is estimated for b i  X  1. 6. The probability distribution value for the i th position is given by normalizing the frequency of occurrence of b i  X  1 in the previously selected population as given by Eq. (5) and represented by k i . Therefore the probability distribution that the random variable X i takes the value b i in the selected population can be written as k  X  X  k 1 ; ... ; k B . 7. Limiting thresholds are defined to avoid a strict value assignment strategy resulting from the loss of the desired variability in the population. When estimating the probability distribution for b i  X  1, if the i th bit position of all the chromosomes in the selected population is binary 1 then
P  X  X i  X  1  X  is assigned a value 0.9 instead of 1. Similarly a value of 0.1 is selected for all zeros at a particular bit position for the selected population. 8. Since the transmitted symbols are independent of each other and so are all k i , the joint probability distribution becomes the product of simple univariate marginal distribution. The joint probability distribution P t  X  x  X  of a particular symbol vector being among the selected combinations is found using Eq. (4). 9. New individuals are sampled from the estimated joint probability distribution. For each offspring, a bit at the i th position is generated using the univariate normalized fre-quencies as follows:
The function rand  X  X  represents a random number generator following uniform distribution and X i represents the bit value assigned to the i th bit position of the offspring being sampled. 10. The algorithm iterates until the terminating criterion is met. 11. For the simulation results presented in Section 6 a selected number of generations are taken as the terminating criterion of the search algorithm. The detector is tuned to find an appropriate number of generations at each SNR value. 6. Simulation and numerical results
The BER performance analysis of the reported decoders and their comparison with existing state of art MIMO detectors is presented in this section. The improved performance areas for the
MIMO systems employing the heuristic detectors are shown through simulation results. A comparison of the computational complexity is also presented. indicating the optimal number of generations for each value of SNR shown in Fig. 6 . While tuning the decoders for the number of generations the population size for each value of SNR is determined from Fig. 5 . These simulation results show an early occurrence of saturation point with better BER performance for the UMDA based decoder as compared to the GA detector resulting in relatively smaller computational complexity.
The BER performance of the tuned GA and UMDA based detectors is shown in Fig. 7 for a 4 4 MIMO system employing 8-QAM signal constellation, where the optimal values of N pop and N gen are derived from Figs. 5 and 6 , respectively. The derived vectors for GA based decoder are N pop  X  X  10 40 50 60 60 60 and N gen  X  X  10 15 15 20 20 20 for the corresponding values of SNR given by r  X  X  10 15 20 25 30 35 . Similarly the vectors for UMDA based decoder are N pop  X  X  10 26 40 50 50 50 and N gen  X  X  10 15 15 20 20 20 . It is evident that the computational complexity of the UMDA based decoder is less expensive with just about the same BER performance as achieved by the MIMO detector employing GA.

The performance of the reported detection schemes on a 4 4 system for various QAM constellations is presented in Fig. 8 . The BER BER the Euclidean distance of the received vector from the search space. This results in a peculiar behavior in the BER performance of the heuristic algorithms as indicated by the performance crossover point in Fig. 9 . The BER performance of the ZF and
VBLAST decoders is relatively degraded as the complexity of the detection problem is increased by increasing the number of spatial layers. Contrary to this the heuristic algorithms perform better for the 6 6 MIMO system as compared to the 4 4 MIMO system employing 8-QAM signal constellations. Relative gain in the BER performance of the proposed decoders compared to that of the VBLAST decoder for the 6 6 system is greater than for the 4 4 system as shown at an SNR of 25dB in Fig. 9 . The performance gain of approx. 100 for the UMDA decoder is observed in a 6 6 MIMO system whereas the gain on the 4 4 MIMO system is even less than 10.

The proposed decoders are observed to have a better performance for a relatively complex spatially multiplexed system. The VBLAST decoder takes its initial guess from the soft decision made by the ZF detector. The BER performance gain for the VBLAST decoder compared to the ZF detector at an SNR of 20dB for the 4 4 and the 6 6 MIMO systems is shown in Fig. 9 .
The simulated heuristic algorithms are initialized by the output of the VBLAST decoder. The reported detectors show a superior performance in terms of the achieved BER gain as compared to the VBLAST, also shown for an SNR of 20dB in Fig. 9 .

The BER performance for the UMDA decoder is twice as good as that of the GA based decoder in a 6 6 MIMO system shown for an SNR of 25dB in Fig. 9 . Moreover the UMDA based detector is computationally less expansive and has better BER performance as compared to the GA detector as discussed in the next section. It worth mentioning that the computational complexity for the ML decoder running on a 4 4 MIMO system with 8-QAM signal constellation is less than for a 6 6 MIMO system employing 4-QAM. Therefore in the simulation results of Fig. 9 the decoder is applied to a relatively more complex MIMO system whereas the algorithmic parameters are tuned for a computationally less expansive problem. 6.2. Computational complexity comparison
Computational complexity of the proposed heuristic detectors is examined and compared with the ML and the VBLAST detectors in this section. As the hardware cost of each algorithm is implementation specific, we try to provide a rough estimate of 10 0 BER reduction in computational complexity of the heuristic decoders as compared to that of the ML detector.

The complexity X  X erformance trade off is found to be better when the heuristic detectors are used with higher order MIMO system configurations and relatively complex modulation schemes. The proposed decoders operating with the tuned algorithmic parameters for a 4 4 8-QAM MIMO system achieve a performance gain of 6 and 7dB for GA and UMDA, respectively. The relative complexity of the GA and UMDA based decoders is 24.3% and 20.4% to that of the ML detector, respectively. As the system configuration gets complex the performance of the heuristic algorithms improves significantly. A gain of 12 and 14dB is achieved by GA and UMDA, respectively, for a 6 6 4-QAM MIMO system. The corresponding reduction in computa-tional complexity is of 73% and 79.3% for GA and UMDA, respectively. The heuristic algorithms can therefore be used as an efficient solution for symbols vector detection in higher order complex MIMO systems and the UMDA based detector is found to outperform GA in terms of BER performance and computational complexity. 7. Conclusion
In this paper a simulation based performance analysis of GA and UMDA while operating as symbol detectors in multiple antenna communication system is presented. The optimization methods show promising results when employed as decoders in higher order MIMO systems with relatively complex configura-tions. A major gain is achieved in the reduction of computational complexity by the heuristic algorithms when compared with the traditional ML detection. Although VBLAST decoder has less complexity as compared to the reported heuristic algorithms but the degradation in its BER performance quite obvious. The results also show that a trade off can be made between complexity and optimality in order to incorporate the proposed decoders in practical MIMO systems. Significant performance gain is shown
