 There are many statistic-based motif methods for enzyme function prediction capable of high accuracy; however, most of these methods [2,3,4,5] avoid the direct usage of motifs generated from binding and catalytic sites to predict enzyme function predic-tion. These methods use other resources from surrounding sites that contain very few understand how motifs of binding and catalytic sites are combined in order to perform enzyme function prediction. This is a reason why the statistic-based motifs cannot completely replace expert-identified motifs. In this paper, we develop a method to predict enzyme functions based on direct usage of binding and catalytic sites. Motifs motivation is that different enzymes with the same reaction mechanism at binding and catalytic sites frequently perform the same enzyme function. In previous work [16], we introduced a unique process to discover reactive motifs using block scan filtering , Mutation Control , and Reactive Site-Group Definition . The main step in reactive motif discovery is mutation control whose objective is to determine a complete substi-tution group for each position in the sequences, such that the substitution group con-tains all possible amino acids that can be substituted. 
In this paper, we show that the concept lattice provides an efficient representation of various types of bio-chemical background knowledge and efficient computational support for the operations of mutation control. We propose a method to construct an amino-acid property context from background knowledge which is Taylor Physico-Chemistry table [8]. From the amino-acid property context, the concept lattice repre-constructed. Each concept represents a substitution group; lattice operators are applied to obtain complete substitution groups. Reactive motifs generated from the concept-lattice mutation control step are used as input to the C4.5 learning algorithm to obtain the enzyme prediction model. The reactive motifs and PROSITE [1] motifs separately are used as training data for the C4.5 learning model, which is then evaluated using a test dataset containing 19,258 amino acid sequences of 235 known enzyme functions. The learning algorithm using reactive motifs as training data accurately identified 72.6% of the test sequences, compared to 67.25 % accuracy for PROSITE. 
The overall process of reactive motif discovery is described in section 2. Section 3 presented in section 4, and conclusions are given in section 5. In this section, we present an overall process of reactive motif discovery, consisting of three steps: data preparation and block scan filtering , mutation control , and reactive in [16]. 2.1 Data Preparation and Block Scan Filtering 19,258 enzyme sequences of 235 functions. Within this enzyme sequence dataset, we use sequences containing binding or catalytic sites. Designating the binding or cata-sub-sequences form a binding and catalytic site database. Sub-sequences in the bind-tion descriptions. There are in total 291 subgroups. and catalytic site database. For each binding or catalytic site sub-sequence, the dataset similarity score is computed using amino-acid similarity scores such as BLOSUM62 [12]. The sequences are ranked according to similarity scores; then a block member filtering method [13] is applied. A block is designated as high quality when each site in the block has at least 3 positions presenting the same type of amino acids, as shown in Fig. 2. 2.2 Mutation Control An enzyme mechanism can be represented by several binding or catalytic site subse-enzyme mechanism have common or similar properties. Some positions in all se-quences contain the same type of amino acids; these positions are called conserved regions . Other positions may have many types of amino acids, but having similar properties. All amino acids in the same position are grouped with respect to the muta-Therefore, a substitution group is a set of amino acids having common or similar properties that can be substituted at a specific position in a block. There are two kinds of substitution groups, represented by patterns as in the PROSITE motifs: 
Mutation control constructs a motif consisting of the complete substitution group or conserved region from each position in the sequence. Using the results of the block Mutation control extends each amino acids substitution group to include all amino acids having common characteristics, identified using the Taylor physico-chemistry described next. 
A complete substitution group is constructed by examining both the common prop-many types of amino acids that yield the same enzyme reaction mechanism. These amino acids have common or similar properties. For example, the amino-acids substi-tution group [HT] has Polar and Hydrophobic as common properties, which are nec-essary for an enzyme mechanism to function. 
The prohibited properties are all the properties that are not found by any member hibited properties. The boundary properties and common properties are used together to identify the complete substitution group. 
To be certain that a given substitution group contains all possible amino-acids that can be substituted, the mutation control extends each substitution group to include all amino acids that have all the common properties and only properties in the boundary set (i.e. no prohibited properties). For example, complete substitution group for [HT] is [HTWYK]. This is the greatest amino acid substitution group that has all common properties and the only properties they have are boundary properties. This complete substitution group is determined at all other positions of the quality block to produce a motif. For the quality block in Fig. 2, we obtain the motif [HTWYK] [CDENQST] [CNST] P H [KNQRT] [DNP] R [FILMV] [DENQS] [ACDGNST] . . . 
The source of background information can be used in block scan filtering and mu-tation control should be the same. For example, if the BLOSUM62 table is used as the transformed from BLOSUM62 should be used in the mutation control step. More details about background knowledge transformation can be found in [16]. 2.3 Reactive Site  X  Group Definition From the previous step, motifs produced from different records of the same binding or catalytic functions are, by definition, redundant. They are grouped together and repre-tion . Although motifs are retrieved from the same original binding or catalytic sites in the same subgroup of the binding and catalytic site database, they can have different binding structures to the same substrate. In other words, there are many ways using the BLOSUM62 data and 1,390 using the Taylor physico-chemistry table. In this section, we apply concept lattice theory [17,18] to mutation control in order to determine complete substitution groups. From the amino acids context, the concept lattice is generated, where concepts are constructed as amino acids substitution groups sharing common properties. The generated concept lattice represents hierarchy of amino acids substitution groups sharing common properties. From this lattice, muta-tion control operations are performed to determine complete amino-acid substitution mutation control. Then, concept lattice-based mutation control operations are defined. 3.1 Basic Definitions Amino acid properties context: An amino acid properties context is a triple (  X  ,  X  , R), where  X  and  X  are finite sets of amino acids and properties, and R  X   X  x  X  is a binary relation. eRp denotes that the amino acid e  X   X  is in relation R to the property p  X   X  , if e has the property p (or e verifies property p). f(Extent)=Intent and g(Intent) =Extent. Let L be a set of all concepts formed from the context (  X  ,  X  , R), and let c  X  L. Hence, c is formed by two parts: an extent represent-ing a subset of  X  (here, amino acids), denoted as Extent(c), and an intent representing the common properties between this subset of amino acids, denoted as Intent(c). For example, ({A,C,G},{small, tiny, hydrophobic}) is a concept of the context in Table 1. This means that there are no more than three amino acids possessing at least all proper-ties in {small, tiny, hydrophobic} and sharing at most these properties in common. The concept X  X  extent is an amino-acid substitution group sharing similar properties. Amino acid propertie s concept lattice: An amino acid properties concept lattice is a concept lattice L = (L,  X  ) of an amino acid properties context (  X  ,  X  , R) , is a com-structure imposes: from (  X  ,  X  ,R) and S  X  L. The Meet(S) and Join(S) elements are given as follows: 3.2 Complete Amino-Acids Substitution Group Discovery In this section, we present a method for finding complete amino acid substitution group at a given position of a block of amino acids resulted from the block scan filtering step concepts to find candidate substitution groups having the greatest common properties and having the greatest boundary properties. Finally, it returns the common amino acids of both substitution groups as the complete amino-acid substitution group. 3.2.1 Finding Amino Acid Concepts concept in the amino acid-properties lattice called amino-acid concept [19]. Consider-ing Fig. 3, ({H}, {aro,hyd,cha,pol,pos}) and ({T,C} ,{hyd,sma,pol}) are introduction concepts of amino-acids H and T. 3.2.2 Finding Candidate Substitution Group Having Common Properties section 2.2), complete substitution group should have common properties. In order to determine the substitution group having common properties at most or greatest set of acid concepts derived from the previous section. Join(S) returns a concept whose intent contains greatest common properties of S and whose extent is a candidate sub-stitution group. 
In the following, we show how the greatest common properties of amino acids {H,T} and its candidate substitution group can be determined. From the previous step, we obtained ({H},{aro,hyd,cha,pol,pos}) and ({T,C} ,{hyd,sma,pol}) as amino-acid Join(S) operator. ({W,H,Y,K,T,C},{hyd,pol}) is the result of Join(S) whose extent represents candidate substitution group of amino acids {H,T}. 3.2.3 Finding Candidate Substitution Group Having Boundary Properties According to the definition of a substituti on group (described in Section 2.2), a com-plete substitution group should exclude any amino acid having the prohibited proper-ties that prevent the enzyme mechanism function. The substitution group having the greatest set of boundary properties is the result of the union of the extent of all super-The intent of the virtual boundary concept includes only the greatest boundary proper-ties and its extent is an empty set. A virtual boundary concept can be formally defined as follows: and S  X  L. A concept ) ) ( , ( U (S) = (  X  , I ) and I  X  U In the following, we show how the greatest set of boundary properties of amino acids {H,T} and their candidate substitution group can be determined. From Section 3.2.1, we obtain S = {({H},{aro,hyd,cha,pol,pos}), ({T,C} ,{hyd,sma,pol})} as a set of virtual boundary concept ({},{aro,hyd,cha,pol ,pos,sma}) is created. We then link it as the immediate predecessor concept of the bottom concept. Then, we determine its immediate predecessor concepts by choosin g the immediate predecessor concepts of the bottom concept having no prohibited properties, which is the set of concepts {({H},{aro,hyd,cha,pol,pos}), ({T,C},{hyd,cha,pol,pos})}, represented by a dashed node in Fig. 3. Finally, from the set of super-concepts of the virtual boundary concept, we select only object concepts. Then, the union of the extent of those object concepts is the substitution group having boundary properties {H,T,W,Y,F}. 3.2.4 Complete Amino Acid Substitution Group Once both candidate substitution groups are extracted from the pr evious step, a com-plete amino acid substitution group can be determined by finding the common amino acids appearing in both substitution groups. From Fig. 3, amino acids having common properties are {W,H,Y,K,T,C}; while amino acids having the boundary properties are {H,T,W,Y,F}. Thus, the amino acids that appear in both substitution groups form the complete substitution group {H,T,W,Y} of amino acids {H, T}, as required. We performed experiments using a dataset containing 19,258 protein sequences that covers 235 enzyme functions, using the C4.5 learning algorithm with a 5-fold cross validation. 
The accuracy of the enzyme function prediction models is shown in Table 2. Each prediction model is constructed using reactive motifs generated from different back-ground knowledge. The model constructed with reactive motifs generated using BLOSUM62 is called BLOSUM  X  reactive motif . The model constructed with reactive motifs generated using Taylor X  X  physico-chemistry table is called physico-chemistry  X  reactive motif . The reference model, called conserved amino acid  X  reactive motif , is are generated from conserved regions using BLOSUM62. In case the conserved re-gion-group definition step is not applied, the BLOSUM  X  reactive motifs model gives the best results with 68.69% accuracy. The prediction model using physico-chemistry  X  reactive motifs with application of conserved region-group definition gives the best accuracy, 72.58%; however, the accuracies of all models are very close. 
Table 3 shows the prediction accuracy of en zyme function prediction model, with respect to different class members using PROSITE motifs. The accuracy of the pre-diction model retrieved from PROSITE mo tifs gives the best accuracy of 67.25%. In this paper, we show that concept lattice is an efficient representation of bio-chemistry background knowledge and an efficient computational support for mutation control operations. To obtain an enzyme prediction model, reactive motifs generated learning algorithm. Our enzyme prediction model yields good results (~70% accuracy of enzyme function prediction) and can overcome problems such as lack of protein or enzyme functional information; only about ~5.8% in our dataset contain information about binding and catalytic sites. The reactive motifs using physico-chemistry back-the number of reactive motifs found per enzyme sequence is very good. It indicates the motifs are very specific. 
The limited improvement in accuracy observed when using the conserved region group definition indicates that the details of the mechanism descriptions need further improvement. Improving the quality of the descriptions of binding and catalytic sites would, in the authors' view, further increase the accuracy of enzyme function predic-tion using reactive motifs.
