 The third ACM international workshop on cloud data management was held in Glasgow , Scotland, U.K. on October 28, 2011 and co-located with the ACM 20th Conference on Information and Knowledge Ma nagement (CIKM). The main objective of the workshop was to address the challenges of large-scale data management ba sed on the cloud computing infrastructure. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from cloud computing, distributed storage, query processing, parallel algorithms, data mining, and system analysis, all attendees share common research interests in maximizing performance, reducing cost of cloud data management and enlarging the scale of their endeavors. The workshop attracted 14 submi ssions from Asia, North America and Europe, out of which the program committee finally accepted 6 full papers . The accepted papers focused on cloud-based storage, machine learning, query processing, distributed algorithms, security and privacy. A. General Literature Algorithms, Management The technical paper session cons isted of seven presentations, whose main points are summarized next. Together, they give a snapshot of new developments on data management spurred by cloud computing. These papers c over a variety of topics. We believe that researchers and deve lopers will draw inspiration from these papers to further appreciate this exciting new technology, specifically from the perspective of cloud data management. The paper entitled L earning-based Entity Resolution with MapReduce utilizes cloud computing from a machine-learning perspective. Entity resolution is a crucial step for data quality and data integration. Learning-based approaches show high effectiveness at the expense of poor efficiency. To reduce the typically high execution times, the authors Lars Kolb, Hanna K X pcke, Andreas Thor and Erhard Rahm investigated how learning-based entity resolution can be realized in a cloud infrastructure using MapReduce. They proposed and evaluated two efficient MapReduce-based stra tegies for pair-wise similarity computation and classifier application on the Cartesian product of two input sources. Their evaluati on on real-world datasets shows the high efficiency and effectiven ess of the proposed approaches. Thomas J X rg, Roya Parvizi, Hu Yong and Stefan Dessloch explored the application of view maintenance techniques in a MapReduce environment. In the paper Incremental Recomputations in MapReduce , they regarded a MapReduce program as a view definition and the computed result as a materialized view. However, MapR educe programs need to be re-executed to obtain up-to-date results after base data has changed. The authors presented a case study based on typical MapReduce programs mentioned in Google's or iginal MapReduce paper. By adapting view maintenance techniques, the results can be recomputed in an incremental fashion considerably more efficiently. Based on the case study, they developed a general solution for the incremental maintenance of the class of MapReduce programs that compute self-maintainable aggregates. In Efficient Data Distribution Strategy for Join Query Processing in the Cloud, Haiping Wang, Xiaofeng Meng and Yunpeng Chai studied join query processing in cloud. The challenge is that, to finish a join query in the cloud, data among different nodes need to be transferred. The transmission cost (network workload between servers and the transmission time delay) will be very high if the strategy is not properly chosen. They investigated using redundant data for join query optimization in cloud environment. Two novel algorith ms, Set Cover based algorithm (SC) and Minimum Element based algorithm (ME), were proposed to reduce data transmission cost. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed methods can greatly reduce the data transmission cost compared and are very close to the optimal strategy. In the Paper entitled Trustworthy Middlewar e Services in the Cloud , Imad Abbadi endeavored to wards the establishment of trust in the cloud, despite its dynamic nature and distributed resources. He proposed to esta blish trustworthy middleware services that could help in movi ng in the direction of establishing trust in the cloud. The paper mainly focuses on identifying the functions for establishing trustw orthy middleware services for supporting home healthcare applicati on, in particular those that are required to address the security, privacy, and resilience properties of home healthcare application. Yuxiao Dong and Qing Ke presented TeleDatA, a cloud-based system that combines data mining, social network analysis and statistics analysis with MapReduce framework, for knowledge discovery in telecommunications. As a full functionality system, TeleDatA provides data-flow or iented preprocessing utilities, chain engine, expression evaluati on engine and core analysis algorithms. The shift from client -server to cloud platform is indispensible for telecommunication data analysis, due to the continued exponential growth in both the volume and the complexity of telecom data. In their paper TeleDatA: Data Mining, Social Network Analysis and Statistics Analysis System based on Cloud Computing in Telecommunication Industry , they focused on the scalability and parallelism introduced by the MapReduce model, which makes TeleDatA capable of handling tera even peta-scale data. In the Paper entitled Authentication of Range Query Results in MapReduce Environments , Ziwei Yang, Shen Gao, Jianliang Xu and Byron Choi studied the issue of query authentication on cloud platform. Authenticated query processing has been an important problem in outsourced databases. However, all existing works on query authentication are confined to a single server. In this paper, the authors presented a scalable authentication solution for range queries based on the MapReduce framework. To address the problem of parallelism and load balancing, they proposed two algorithms for mapping the authentication work to a set of sub-tasks that can be executed on the slave nodes in parallel. They also developed an optimization technique for multiple concurrent queries to improve system performance by shared execution. Prof. Paul Watson from the Newcastle University, UK kindly gave us a keynote speech on an emerging cloud computing pattern, which is called the Panel of Experts. In this talk, he described this cloud pattern and gave examples of its use. The Panel of Experts pattern can be applied when a range of algorithms "compete" to provide the best solution to a problem. It can therefore be viewed as the dual of map-reduce as it applies a set of functions to one data ite m, whereas map-reduce applies one function to a set of data items. The pattern has been evaluated through a large chemical informa tics application which can take days to run on tens of cloud nodes. CloudDB 2011 was the third CIKM-associated workshop addressing the challenges of large database services based on the cloud computing infrastructure. Whilst these emerging services have reduced the cost of data storage and content delivery by several orders of magnitude, there is significant complexity involved in ensuring large data service to scale when one needs consistency and reliability under peak loads. Cloud-based environment has the technical requirement to manage data center virtualization, lower cost and boost reliability by consolidating systems on the cloud. The existing research works in the area of cloud-based data management are still somehow immature and leave significant room for progress. The works presented in the workshop mainly focused on adapting existing Grid and Map/Reduce techniques to the cloud environment. The participants agreed that many ope n challenges still remain such as cloud data security and the efficiency of distributed storage and query processing in the cloud. We would like to thank the program committee members, authors and attendees, for making CloudDB 2011 a successful workshop. Finally, we also express our great appreciation for the support from Renmin University of China, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and H ong Kong Baptist University.
