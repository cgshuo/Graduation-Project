 The system balance and performance improvement in database cluster mainly in-cludes two aspects: the balanced data dist ribution and the workload balance. Although closely related to the data distribution approaches. Some other works have discussed another point of view, the heterogeneity is unavoidable in database cluster. Different nodes have different computing capabilities due to a variety of CPU calculation power, memory capacity and disk IO bandwidth etc. Some works have focused on the parallel processing in shared memory DBMS[5 ], and some mainly considered the I/O performance. 
In this paper, we mainly discuss an improved data distribution method based on the widely-used Range partition algorithm, which means distributing the data non-computing capabilities of homogeneous or heterogeneous nodes. For the problem of nodes, which can dynamically re-balance both of the distribution of the data and the workloads in the cluster system. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes an improved data distribution algorithm. Section 3 introduces how the online migrating algorithm rebal-concluding remarks. When initializing the data allocation in the database cluster, we assume that the whole data in the cluster system are called global data and all the global data have the same accessing probability. The global data are allocated in hybrid mode and classified into an improved data distribution method about the global partition data in this paper. 
For the partitioned data, we propose an Improved-Range (IR) partition algorithm which is not only fit for the symmetric distribution in homogeneous cluster but also fit for the asymmetric distribution in heterogeneous cluster. The IR partition scheme is a weighted Range partition method according to the different comprehensive compute capability of heterogeneous nodes. That means compound weighted compute value of different nodes, and the cardinality of i D can be evaluated with i D  X  P i D  X   X  , and compound weighted compute value of single node i, while the denominator T W is the sum of the weighted compute value of all nodes in database cluster, that is 
Since the compound compute capability in a single node is mainly associated with three types of computing resources mentioned above, the weighted compute value of some node is given by rate weights of the i th node taken up in the cluster respectively, and the formula must satisfy the constraint that is 1 sources into a uniform evaluation value. Although the IR data distribution scheme maybe works well in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cluster under the assumption of the same accessing probability, the workloads in the real applications. After longer running time, the cluster system may and xi denote the response time from some node and the number of transactions dis-patched to the node respectively. 
To solve the problem of the data skew, we propose a dynamic on-line data migrat-ing algorithm. We consider the over-loaded node as the source node (S) and the node destination set D got from the set { )} , ( { min 1 migrating procedure is just as illustrated below: 
Step 1. statistic the hot data hot D and partition 
Step 2. lock the hot data of the source node, queue the transactions which need to access the migrating data; 
Step 3. replicate every part of partitioned hot data to corresponding Di which receive the amount of i data; 
Step 4. log the changes of distribution into meta data of scheduler; 
Step 5. delete the hot data of S which have been mi-grated; 
Step 6. unlock the hot data and take up the transac-tions from the queue to execute; 
Step 7. check if the system is balanced, then exit the procedure; 
Step 8. else loop to step 1. In the database cluster, we develop a middleware to apply the balance methods of data database cluster system shows in figure 1. To simplify the measurement of the com-pound weighted value of the nodes, we only simulate the type of OLTP requests. As a weight for different resources in some application. We can focus on the data distribu-tion and the performance of the cluster system. 
The ideal geometric increasing of throughput as increasing of nodes has been shown in Fig 2, which is an ideal case marked with dotted line without considering any extra cost such as communication cost. Whereas, in the actual test the through-proved-range partition method in the database cluster, which has pictured with solid square line. But for the traditional range partition method, the max transaction achieve the saturation point because of hot access. Even though more nodes are added to the database cluster, the scale up of the database cluster is still finite. 
In the graph 3, the balanced curve denotes the middleware system applied with our online migrating algorithm and the unbalanced curve is on the contrary. In the way of more and more transactions are blocked in waiting queue. When applying the IR data distribution method and the online migrating algorithm, the cluster system can avoid creasing as increasing of nodes, the cluster system can scale up to more nodes. The performance improvement of database cluster is mainly related to the data distri-bution strategy and the workload allocation scheme. In this paper, we have proposed make full use of its computing resources. 
Our experimental results show that the improved range partition method does keep ing the nodes. As a result, the cluster system achieves better scalability.
