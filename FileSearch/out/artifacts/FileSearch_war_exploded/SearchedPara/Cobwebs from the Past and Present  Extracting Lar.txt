 Social graph construction from various sources has been of interest to researchers due to its application potential and the broad range of technical challenges involved. The World Wide Web provides a huge amount of continuously updated data and information on a wide range of topics created by a variety of content providers, and makes the study of ex-tracted people networks and their temporal evolution valu-able for social as well as computer scientists. In this paper we present SocGraph -an extraction and exploration system for social relations from the content of around 2 billion web pages collected by the Internet Archive over the 17 years time period between 1996 and 2013. We describe methods for constructing large social graphs from extracted relations and introduce an interface to study their temporal evolu-tion.
The advances of the computer science and technology in the last decades enabled the extraction and analysis of social networks from various types of structured and unstructured data sources. Some sources provide explicit and easy to extract information about user relations. This includes on-line platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn that maintain user databases and offer software interfaces for ac-cessing contacts, friends, or followers. However, in many cases information about social connections is hidden within unstructured data such as Web pages and archives. In the past, personal relationships have been extracted from tex-tual and multimedia sources such as books, historical repos-itories [3, 1, 9] and web search engines [5, 2, 6]. Despite the work towards increasing the efficiency of finding entity rela-tions on the web [7] only recently in [8] a method suitable for mining of large graphs has been proposed.
 and computer scientists our tool will provide a gateway to the information and knowledge about connections between people stored in the world wide web in the last few decades. The architecture of our system is schematically shown in Fig. 1. First, we analyze the web archive to detect co-mentions of entities in the web pages. In the next step, at the server, we extract the temporal statistics and construct the social graph by connecting extracted entity pairs using detected edges.
 Finally, the user can access the application and create, vi-sualize, modify and interact with the graphs by issuing new queries via a web browser based user interface. In the follow-ing we provide an overview of the system components and show how results are presented to the user in more detail.
The Internet Archive (IA) is a non-profit organization crawling the World Wide Web since 1996. For our appli-cation we have access to web pages from about 1 . 8  X  10 9 distinct URLs, collected by the IA in the time period of 17 years between 1996 and 2013. Extracting data even from a small sample of all archived web pages is a computationally intensive and requires parallelization of processes.
We used Hadoop and Spark [10] technology on a dedicated 25 node computing cluster with 1.3TB main memory and 268 CPU cores to extract co-mentions of persons directly from the archived documents. We stored extracted names, patterns, URLs, date of the crawl and additional miscella-neous information in a relational database, which can be accessed from the server process in real time. The crawled documents of MIME type text have been encapsulated in 346,000 Web ARChive (WARC) files.
The entity pairs are extracted from the body of the archived documents first by splitting the documents into sentences us-ing the Stanford CoreNLP library [4]. Then extracted sen-tences are scanned, detecting the constructs matching the template using a person names dictionary and a sliding window with a pattern length of three words. To reduce noise in the data we exclude pairs with identical names and discard overly long sentences and patterns. We computed the weight of the node as 1 /n , where n is the number of persons co-occurring in the sentence. In Fig.2a we plot the distribution of the weight per entry in the data set. The distribution of the number of extracted pairs per year is shown in Fig.2b.
For building the social graph, we select extracted pairs matching the user query and user defined parameters such as the time period T , and merge them into a network con-sidering the node weight and the edge weight between two nodes as follows: where n is the number of co-mentioned persons in a sentence. one and a color scheme ranging from blue to red is utilized to indicate particular weight value from small to large, re-spectively. Overall, there are three modes of the SocGraph operation, namely: (i) A static graph can be computed and visualized over (ii) For a specified sliding window a temporal statistical In the demonstration we will primarily show how the Soc-Graph time travel graph system works and how the social networks are constructed from the content of IA web pages. We will demonstrate the graphical interface usage for static and dynamic graph visualization. Additionally, we can elab-orate in more detail on the person pair extraction process and explain the underlying parallelization algorithms.
We will explore the social networks of Barack Obama (node N BO ) and John McCain (node N MC ) for the one year period from May, 2008 to May, 2009, roughly corresponding to the US presidential election,as an example. The weight per entry has been set to 0.2, which means that we allow data records with up to four additional persons. The edge weight filter has been set to 0.025, in order to not overload the graphs and focus on the interesting entities. The static graph is plotted in Fig.3. A dynamic graph has been con-structed with a sliding window of 30 days. The series of graphs are shown in Fig.4. For instance we observe that Hillary Clinton ( N HC ) node was connected to ( N BO ) from the beginning and disappeared in June 2008, corresponding to the time point, where Hillary Clinton endorsed Barack Obama and withdrew her candidacy. In following the sizes of both nodes, N BO and N MC , remain similar until Novem-ber, where the actual election took place and N MC drasti-cally reduced the weight already in following month after Barack Obama became a president of the United States. Shortly before in September, Sarah Palins X  ( N SP ) talk on the side of John McCain had positive impact on the votes for this candidate. This fact is also reflected in our graph where N SP appeared in September connected to N MC .
In this paper we introduced a demonstration of SocGraph -a social graph extracting system for large networks from In-ternet Archive data. In contrast to other research concerned with graph construction from web related data, we are fo-cused on the temporal evolution of social networks implicitly contained in the stored web pages. In our future work we plan to include pattern filtering techniques, integrate data from search engines and evaluate event identification, as well as sentiment analysis of the personal relationships and their evolution. Our system will be offered as a service within the EU Project Alexandria as part of a Web Observatory accessible to social and computer scientists as well as to general public for social network visualization and evolu-tion analysis. The demonstration is available on our web
