 Abstract This special section of Language Resources and Evaluation contains a selection of presentations from ICGL that focus on interoperability for lexical and semantic databases and ontologies. These resources in effect constitute the  X  X  X ub X  X  of semantic interoperability by providing means to link language resources such as corpora to common categories and concepts. As such, interoperability within and among these databases is the necessary next step to enable semantic compatibility for language data.
 Keywords Interoperability Standards Language resources 1 Overview Language resources, including not only corpora but also lexicons, knowledge bases, ontologies, and grammars, support the development of language processing applications that are increasingly important to the global society. As the need for cross-lingual studies and applications grows, it is increasingly important to develop resources in the world X  X  languages that can be compared and linked, used and analyzed with common software, and that contain linguistic information for the same or comparable phenomena. We envision the eventual development of a global web of language resources, wherein, for example, linguistically-annotated corpora in multiple languages are inter-linked via the use of common categories, or categories that are mapped to one another. In this vision, resources such as wordnets and framenets are linked not only to versions in different languages, but also to each other; and common representations enable analysis and use of resources in different languages and of different types within available systems.

Substantial effort has been devoted to the creation of such resources for the world X  X  major languages over the past decades, and new projects are developing similar resources for less widely-used languages. Efforts such as the Global WordNet and the development of framenets in multiple languages seek to create and link specific lexical and semantic resources across languages and to integrate them into general-purpose ontologies such as SUMO and DOLCE. However, a continuing obstacle to linking and sharing such resources is a lack of interoperability among them, in terms of both syntactic and semantic interoperability. Syntactic interop-erability focuses on formats and protocols for exchanged information, without guaranteeing that the interpretation is the same; whereas semantic interoperability ensures a consistent interpretation and therefore common results when information is processed by different systems. Within the natural language processing community, some progress has been made toward establishing common formats and protocols, or at least a common underlying model that fosters isomorphism and hence easy mapping. Semantic interoperability, on the other hand, has proved to be a far more difficult problem for the field. Efforts within the International Standards Organization, in particular within ISO TC37 SC4, are underway to address this issue, but there is still some distance to go to define widely-accepted standards that can be readily implemented by the community.

We see interoperability as a key problem to be tackled to move the field of language processing forward via universal access to language resources. Interop-erability is not only critical for work at the leading edge of the field, but also allows researchers who have fewer resources for performing costly and time-consuming transductions to have the same capabilities as others. To this end, the International Conference on Global Interoperability for Language Resources (ICGL) was established in 2008, sponsored by the Department of Chinese, Translation and Linguistics at City University of Hong Kong. A second edition was held in 2010, also at City University in Hong Kong. The conferences drew a wide range of participants interested in language resource creation, annotation, management, and international standards.

This special section of Language Resources and Evaluation contains a selection of presentations from ICGL that focus on interoperability for lexical and semantic databases and ontologies. These resources in effect constitute the  X  X  X ub X  X  of semantic interoperability by providing means to link language resources such as corpora to common categories and concepts. As such, interoperability within and among these databases is the necessary next step to enable semantic compatibility for language data. The papers in this special section are summarized below.
 Collin Baker X  X  paper describes recent and near-term future developments at FrameNet (FN) and the interoperability issues they raise. It begins by discussing the current state of the Berkeley FN database, the data formats available, as well as the relations between FN grammatical functions and standard parses and between FN frame elements and standard semantic/thematic/theta roles. The paper also discusses FN-related research on Spanish, Japanese, German (SALSA) and other languages and the putative language-independence of frames, and puts forth some ideas about how FrameNet can be opened up to allow broader participation in the development process without losing precision and coherence.

Gerard de Melo and Gerhard Weikum discuss statistical methods for the construction and utilization of lexical databases. They propose a method for automatically producing such resources for new languages based on the original English WordNet and analyze the implications of this approach both from a linguistic perspective and by considering the requirements of natural language processing tasks. Although the resulting wordnets are imperfect in terms of their quality and coverage of language-specific phenomena, they constitute a cheap and suitable alternative and enable cross-lingual interoperability.
 Alex Fang X  X  contribution is a discussion of the construction and annotation of the International Corpus of English (ICE), a corpus constructed primarily for the study of English as a global language. He describes the steps taken to ensure operational uniformity within the project, including corpus design, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing. The paper presents a study that examines the use of adverbial clauses across speech and writing, illustrating the necessity for interoperable analyses of linguistic data in such studies.

Christiane Fellbaum and Piek Vossen discuss the challenges for developing fully interoperable Wordnets in multiple languages. The EuroWordNet experience revealed the shortcomings of an interlingua based on a natural language for this purpose. They therefore propose an alternative model in which a language-independent, formal ontology serves as the hub interlinking the language-specific lexical databases. The model is sketched in the context of KYOTO, a domain-specific multilingual information system based on a central ontology and interconnected wordnets.

There remain many other topics and considerations for achieving interoperability among language resources and language processing tools, and it is clear that full interoperability will take many years of concerted and collaborative community effort to achieve. However, the community is becoming increasingly aware of the need for commonality in order to further the field, and as a result, more and more efforts are being devoted to achieving that goal. By describing some of the first steps toward interoperability, the papers in this special section of LRE will hopefully serve as a basis for continued progress.
