 Summativ e evaluation metho ds for sup ervised adaptiv e topic trac king systems con volve the e ect of system decisions on presen t utilit y with the e ect on future utilit y. This pap er describ es a new formativ e evaluation approac h that focuses on future utilit y for use in the design stage of adaptiv e sys-tems. Topic mo del qualit y is assessed at a prede ned set of points using a xed documen t set to enhance comparabilit y. Exp erimen ts using a vector-space topic trac king system il-lustrate the utilit y of this approac h to formativ e evaluation.

The sup ervised adaptiv e topic trac king task, recen tly in-troduced in Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) evalua-tions, is similar to the TREC adaptiv e ltering task. Both resem ble the traditional "batc h" ltering task, adding a sim-ulation of user interaction by the feedbac k pro vided when the system deliv ers a putatativ ely relev ant documen t. Sys-tems mak e an immediate decision whether to displa y eac h incoming documen t, usually by assigning a con dence score then applying a threshold. Displa ying a documen t has two main e ects: the immediate e ect on user satisfaction ("presen t utilit y"), and the e ect on the qualit y of the topic mo del that the system will rely as a basis for future decisions ("ex-pected future utilit y," whic h may increase if the mo del is adapted based on feedbac k from the user) [2]. This view suggests that an evaluation approac h that separates the two e ects could pro vide greater insigh t into the consequences of system design decisions. TDT and TREC adopted some-what di eren t evaluation strategies, but both con volve the two e ects.

In TDT, a Detection Error Tradeo (DET) curv e is used to plot the probabilit y of missing an on-topic story against the probabilit y of presen ting an o -topic story . The points on the curv e are obtained by sweeping a threshold value across all topics sim ultaneously . A cost function is com-puted for eac h point, and the system is then evaluated by both the actual cost (for whatev er threshold was actually chosen) and by the minim um cost over the whole curv e. This implicitly assumes that scores for di eren t topics are com-parable. When all scores are normalized consisten tly and the topic mo del does not vary over time, this is a reasonable assumption. In adaptiv e trac king, however, the topic mo del changes as additional relev ance judgmen ts become available. Reducing the threshold can impro ve future utilit y at the ex-pense of presen t utilit y, but the DET curv e focuses solely on presen t utilit y; failing to re ect the e ect on future util-ity. Changing the threshold and re-running the system may therefore not actually yield the miss and false alarm rates that were depicted on the DET curv e.

An alternativ e approac h was adopted in TREC, where a utilit y measure (conceptually , the inverse of cost) was plot-ted against time. That curv e has the virtue of illustrat-ing how the net e ect accum ulates over time, but utilit y measures at di eren t points in time con volve the e ects of presen t utilit y, future utilit y, and di eren t documen t sets. In a sense, this is the con verse of the DET curv e's limita-tions; DET curv es are insensitiv e to changes in future util-ity, while the TREC plots mask the future utilit y e ect in a larger range of factors. In this pap er, we prop ose a new approac h that o ers useful insigh ts into the e ect of mo del design on future utilit y to supp ort formativ e evaluation of adaptiv e topic trac king systems.
The main goal of our prop osed approac h is to system-atically characterize the e ect of topic mo del adaptation on future utilit y in a way that is directly comparable over time. In order to trace mo del qualit y, we sample a set of topic mo dels that the system incremen tally builds during the adaptation pro cess. Since system beha vior migh t change any time feedbac k becomes available, we would ideally like to sample a topic mo del immediately after eac h feedbac k in-stance. However, we must balance the allo cation of relev ant documen ts between mo del adaptation and evaluation; once a documen t has been used for mo del adaptation, it would mak e little sense to measure how well the new mo del does on that same documen t. We therefore mak e only the rst r relev ant documen ts available for mo del adaptation (in our exp erimen ts, r =10). At eac h of these r poten tial adapta-tion points, we freeze the topic mo del and perform "batc h" (i.e., non-adaptiv e) topic trac king over the entire collection (including previously seen documen ts, but excluding all r relev ant documen ts that were reserv ed for poten tial use in mo del adaptation). The pro cess is rep eated for eac h topic for whic h at least r + n relev ant documen ts are kno wn (in our exp erimen ts, n =10).

We use the mean across the topics of the unin terp olated average precision (MAP) as a measure of exp ected future utilit y at eac h point in time. The MAP measure has the de-sirable characteristic that it is insensitiv e to any de ciencies in cross-topic score normalization. By plotting the MAP value for eac h of the r poten tial update points, we obtain a curv e that sho ws how exp ected future utilit y evolves over time in a manner that is insensitiv e to coinciden t e ects on presen t utilit y. The topic mo del could, of course, also be adapted any time a non-relev ant documen t is selected by the system; the e ect of suc h adaptations on exp ected future utilit y are accum ulated until the next relev ant doc-umen t. This decision limits the resolution of the depiction somewhat, but at the cost of signi can t savings in computa-tional complexit y (for 15 topics with r =10, 180 system runs are required).

To summarize, an adaptiv e system S ad is evaluated for trac king a topic T that is represen ted by a set of training examples t in the follo wing 3 steps: 1. Run S ad once, given the initial topic mo del M T 0 built 2. r +1 di eren t sets of scores O nad ( M T i ) are obtained by 3. Plot MAP for eac h point.
We implemen ted a varian t of the TDT-2004 "UMASS-2" adaptiv e vector space topic trac king system using a xed threshold [1]. We evaluated this system using topics from the TDT-5 collection for whic h there are at least 20 kno wn relev ant documen ts in the evaluation epoch. We excluded a few topics for whic h assessmen t was terminated due to time constrain ts before adequate exhaustiv eness was achiev ed (as determined by the Linguistic Data Consortium). That re-sults in 15 English topics with average of 51 relev ant docu-men ts (out of 254,000 documen ts) in the evaluation epoch (including the 10 reserv ed update points). We illustrate the e ect of three static thresholds on exp ected future utilit y (0.075, 0.15, and 0.25). Figure 1(a) sho ws the results; for con trast, Figure 1(b) sho ws a similar plot for normalized detection cost (whic h con ates presen t and exp ected future utilit y in a manner similar to the TREC utilit y plot, but using a traditional TDT measure).

The curv es indicate that the exp ected future utilit y of eac h system gradually impro ves as additional feedbac k be-comes available, re ecting impro vemen ts in mo del qualit y over time from a relativ ely good initial mo del. We also no-tice that the system can gain a good future utilit y at the exp ense of the presen t utilit y. The presence of a sharp rise in the TDT detection cost for the lowest threshold value can clearly be seen to result from presen t cost rather than mo del qualit y, since that rise is not re ected in MAP . Indeed, the stable MAP at that point suggests that (when averaged over topics) the system is being overly aggressiv e in selecting doc-Figure 1: Adaptation e ectiv eness: (a) Mo del qual-ity [high=go od] (b) TDT detection cost [low=go od] umen ts early on (when the mo del is weak est). This suggests that starting with a relativ ely strict threshold and relaxing that threshold somewhat as relev ant documen ts are disco v-ered migh t be a pro ductiv e strategy when using mo dels of this design. The curv es also sho w that the system achiev es its best performance at the sev enth positiv e feedbac k, af-ter whic h it stabilizes, suggesting that 7 relev ant documen ts could be good enough to initialize suc h system.
In this pap er, we have prop osed a new approac h to for-mativ e evaluation of adaptiv e topic trac king systems that is based on decomp osing one adaptiv e system run into a few (7{10) non-adaptiv e runs that can be compared over time using a simple measure of topic mo del qualit y. The approac h does, however, have two limitations. The rst is that only topics with a substan tial num ber of kno wn rele-vant documen ts in the evaluation epoch can be used; that in turn limits the num ber of suitable topics. That limitation may well be acceptable for formativ e evaluation in whic h the goal is system tuning, not de nitiv e comparisons. The second limitation is that the num ber of required system runs is multiplied by r +2; for slow systems, that may limit the num ber of varian ts that it would be practical to compare.
Some varian ts of our approac h are also possible. Time rather than relev ant documen ts could be plotted on the x-axis if elapsed time is particularly imp ortan t in the appli-cation scenario. When two-sided mo dels that learn from non-relev ant documen ts are being compared, non-relev ant documen ts selected for displa y by any system may also need to be excluded from the stable evaluation sets. As with any approac h to formativ e evaluation, the design of the evalua-tion must naturally trac k closely with the insigh ts that the dev elop ers seek to obtain.
