 The complexity of decision tasks, limited cognitive resources of users, and the tendency to keep the overall decision effort as low as possible lead to the phenomenon of bounded rationality [5], i.e., users employ decision heuristics rather than trying to take an optimal decision. Furthermore, preferences of users are usually not stable entities easily retrieved from memory when requested. More often, preferences are constructed [1] while in a specific decision environment and are therefore likely to change throughout a recommendation session or between sessions, due to contextual effects. Decision making under bounded rationality is a door opene r for different types of non-conscious influences on the decision behavior of a user. Theories from decision psychology and cognitive psychology are trying to explain these influences, for example, decoy effects [2] a nd defaults [3] can trigger significant shifts in item se lection probabilities; in group decision scenarios [4], the visibility of the preferences of other group members can have a significant impact on the final group decision. The major goal of this workshop was to establish a platform for industry and academia to present and discuss new ideas and research results that are related to the topic of human decision making in recommender systems. The workshop consisted of technical sessions in which results of ongoing research were presented, informal group discussions on focused topics, and a keynote talk. The topics of papers submitted to the workshop can be summarized as follows:  X  Avoidance of decision biases : decision biases can lead  X  Intelligent preferen ce elicitation: the understanding of  X  Emotions in recommender systems: emotions play a  X  New application domains: the variety of application  X  Empirical studies: the design of recommender user The workshop material (list of accepted papers, invited talk, and the workshop schedule) can be found at the Decisions@RecSys 2012 workshop webpage : http://recex.ist.tugraz. at/RecSysWorkshop2012.
