 Abstract In recent years, building reference speech corpora was an important part of the activities which provided the necessary linguistic infrastructure in many European countries, for languages with many speakers (e.g., French, German, Spanish, Italian) as well as for those with smaller numbers of speakers (e.g., Swedish, Dutch, Czech, Slovak). This paper describes the process of the creation of a reference speech corpus and its distribution to potential users, as it was done in the case of the Slovene corpus GOS. The corpus structure and fieldwork experiences with recording, labelling system, and two levels of transcription (pronunciation-based and standardized) are described, as well as the main characteristics of the corpus interface (web concordancer) and the availability of the original corpus files.

The GOS corpus ( GOvorjena Slovens  X c  X  ina  X  X poken Slovene X ) has its own defined purpose in a broader scheme of contemporary Slovene language planning (Communication in Slovene 2008 ) as a tool that will help us answer a very basic linguistic question: How is Slovene actually spoken? Historically, this question has been inseparably intertwined with a similar, yet fundamentally different linguistic (and political) question: How should standard Slovene be spoken X  X nd written? When the need for a theoretical linguistic argumentation of the standardization process in Slovene emerged in the 19th century, the only plausible solution seemed to be the combination of a comparative historical grammar of Slavonic languages and extensive dialectological fieldwork. However, both approaches were ideologically sensitive, as the language standardization was an important part of the Slovene national movement. Therefore, dialectology was, at least at the beginning, in search of the unspoiled, pure, natural speech of a rural speaker of Slovene (in opposition to the spoiled X  X n both meanings X  X nd unnatural, mixed speech of an speaker in bi-or plurilingual urban environment). So even if dialectology was supposed to provide an accurate evidence of how Slovene is spoken, its theoretical and methodological restrictions narrowed the targeted results to a rather limited and specific set of data. Dialectology studies therefore did not provide the answer to the question how Slovene is actually spoken in everyday use. The same can be said for any previous language resource for Slovene, as they are all domain limited (Z  X  gank 2010 ).
Therefore, building a corpus of spoken Slovene seems to be a well justified effort even in the simple context of recording the present state of the language, without considering its use in language technologies (especially in speech recognition (Z  X  gank et al. 2008 ; Rotovnik et al. 2007 )) or any other possible linguistic use. The team was aware that the result should be a corpus with as little decontextualisation as possible, without any ideological presumptions of who speaks better or more proper Slovene, and with as little linguistic interpretation as possible. Ultimately, the corpus was meant to satisfy the curiosity of a common speaker of Slovene as well as to help formulate a new set of hypotheses about social, regional, discursive and other stratification of spoken Slovene, based on sound data.

Free access to the corpus on the internet in a user-friendly tool was an important goal of the project from the beginning and it was considered important to make the corpus available also as a raw XML file, so that language technologies (especially language modelling, lexica extraction, etc.) could make use of it.

This paper describes how the reference corpus of spoken Slovene was compiled, transcribed, and made available to users. Parallels with other similar corpora are drawn, and the focus is on lessons learned and solutions devised, which can be of use to researchers building similar resources for other languages. 2 Corpus compilation Different approaches to defining the contents of reference corpora of speech exist, with some corpora being based on demographic criteria, such as speakers X  gender, age, education and region, as used by the Czech National Corpus ORAL2008 (2008). Others, such as the Go  X  teborg Spoken Language Corpus (Allwood et al. 2000 ), are based on context criteria, including spoken language from different social activities/contexts. A more robust scheme, based on context criteria, is used in the C-ORAL-ROM Multilingual Corpus of Roman Languages (Cresti et al. 2004 ). However, the most common approach is to mix both demographic and context British National Corpus ( 2007 ) X  X NC, which contains a demographic part and a context-governed part), (2) using context criteria as a basis and including demographic criteria wherever possible (e.g., the Spoken Dutch Corpus/Corpus Gesproken Nederlands X  X ostdijk et al. 2002 ), (3) using demographic criteria as a basis and covering different context criteria for each of the dialect regions (e.g., the LABLITA Corpus of Spontaneous Spoken Italian). A more complex combination of demographic and context criteria can be found in the CoSIH Corpus of Hebrew (Izre X  X l et al. 2001 ), where demographic criteria represent the basis while parts of the demographically balanced corpus can potentially be augmented according to one or two levels of context criteria, with two additional sub-corpora, one based on demographic criteria and the other based on context criteria.

Reference speech corpora are also available or planned for most other Slavonic languages. These are of various sizes and built on various balance criteria. The Corpus of Spoken Russian (Grishina 2006 ) includes dialectal spoken material and literary texts. It is not sociolinguistically balanced, but the authors hope to compensate for this deficiency by the extent of the corpus (10 million-words). The Czech National Corpus X  X YN ( 2012 ) includes five different spoken corpora: the demographically balanced ORAL2008 (1 million-words), mentioned above; ORAL2006 (1 million-words), including informal spoken Czech from the entire area of Czech dialects; SHOLA2010 (790,000 words), a corpus of school lessons; PMK (675,000 words), a corpus of informal Czech spoken in Prague; and BMK (490,000 words), a corpus of informal Czech spoken in Brno. The authors of the Polish National Corpus (Przepio  X  rkowski et al. 2008 ) plan to include a 30 million-word spoken component. Apart from transcripts of public speeches, parliamentary debates, televised debates, chat shows, radio interviews and news bulletins, a 3 million-word subset of the spoken component will comprise natural, spontaneous conversations. The Corpus of Spoken Slovak (currently 2.6 million-words) includes a sub-corpus of transcribed recordings of witnesses from the Oral History project within the Nation X  X  Memory Institute, in addition to the primary corpus. According to Rusko and Garab X   X  k( 2007 ), the primary corpus is initially focusing on standard Slovak, covering the main demographic criteria (sex, age, education, region) and one context criteria (discourse type). 2.1 Goals of the GOS corpus Before defining corpus content, we specified the main goals of the project:  X  To record a representative sample of different settings of everyday spoken  X  To cover a demographically balanced sample of speakers, including speakers  X  To record the most common situations in which we daily participate either as
Besides these three main goals, we also defined certain more specific parameters:  X  Recordings should include complete speech events as much as possible;  X  Recordings should be as authentic as possible (not recorded in a studio setting, a  X  Recordings should primarily contain spontaneous speech, while written-to-be- X  Speech of children and adolescents could be present in the recordings (e.g.,  X  Educational discourse would represent an important part of the corpus (this was  X  Speech of non-native speakers of Slovene, as well as speakers of Slovene 2.2 Corpus structure For the GOS corpus of spoken Slovene, we chose an approach similar to that used in the BNC; however, the context-based and demographically-based subsets of the corpus are interconnected rather than specified completely separately. By carefully considering the social situations in which speakers participate daily either as speakers or as listeners, we specified the following main discourse types:  X  Public,  X  Non-public non-private,  X  Private.

Public discourse is any type of discourse that is open to the wider public or that addresses a larger group of people; all other discourse is considered non-public. In public discourse, we find three very diverse types of language use: for informative purposes (television, radio), for educational purposes (personal contact: lectures, school lessons, classes, etc.), and for entertainment purposes (television, radio). Non-public non-private discourse is any kind of official or semi-official discourse that is not open to the public, such as work meetings, sales, services, consultation, etc. Private discourse is mostly casual conversation between friends and family members in personal life. We also used a channel criterion covering personal contact, television, radio and telephone. The context criteria were specified and realized with the proportions represented in Table 1 . The percentage of data actually collected is calculated according to the number of words.

We tried to achieve the specified proportions through online tracking of the length of the recordings (presupposing that 1 min of recording contains approx-imately 150 words). As can be seen, the data actually recorded does not deviate significantly from the specified proportions. Only in the public educational section was there a deficit, which was mainly due to the number of words per minute in school lessons being considerably lower than the average.

The part of the corpus containing private discourse is demographically balanced, according to the following demographic criteria:  X  Gender,  X  Age (up to 35, 35 or over),  X  Education (lower, higher),  X  Region,  X  First language,  X  Country of residence.

The data collected were balanced according to statistical data on the Slovene population. Detailed data about the number of words in relation to the demographic criteria can be found on the corpus web page.

It was much more difficult to control demographic criteria during recording for at least two reasons: (1) we did not know the proportions in which different speakers with particular characteristics spoke during the conversation, (2) we had to track different attributes simultaneously; for example, if we lacked speakers with lower education and sought persons with this characteristic, we had to consider the coverage of other demographic attributes as well. As expected, the achieved proportions of the demographically balanced data collected therefore deviate from the specified criteria.

The regional demographic criterion was initially specified very robustly, as we expected difficulties in regional coverage. However, when it turned out that regions could be covered more easily than expected in the private discourse type, we divided the regions according to nine major Slovene urban centres (plus Slovene diaspora and foreign speakers of Slovene). This does not mean that only speech in these urban centres was recorded: in addition to discourse between speakers from urban areas, we also recorded conversations between speakers from rural or more remote areas.

The regional criterion was also specified for non-private discourse sections (public and non-public), but in broader categories:  X  Southwest regions,  X  Southeast regions,  X  The whole of Slovenia (the most watched TV stations and some of the most
More detailed information can be found on the corpus web page. For this type of discourse, more specific coverage of regions was not readily achievable, especially in the non-public non-private section, and we therefore retained the specified robust scheme.

Considering this structure and the available financial resources, the intended size of the corpus was 1 million-words. 2.3 Field work experiences Several issues have to be dealt with when collecting material for a reference corpus of speech. Below we briefly describe how these issues were addressed.

The authorship of all of the data, including the recordings, was settled according to a Creative Commons license (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike). This was necessary in order to make the corpus available to a wider community through an online concordancer; however, this also meant that no previously recorded data could be used and included in the corpus.

Private discourse was recorded by approximately 30 people X  X ostly students originating from different regions, as specified by the demographic criteria X  X ho were able to record in their domestic environment. Experience shows that one person can obtain an average of two or three recordings.

All work with the files, including submission of the recordings, editing, transcription, supervision, etc., was organised through an FTP server. The people with access to the FTP were structured according to their tasks, e.g., recorder, transcriber, editor, etc.

Although we expected recording private conversations to be very problematic, it turned out that it was not so difficult to convince people to participate in recorded speech events. The most difficult recording task was the non-public non-private section, especially the telephone channel. Firstly, there were a number of settings that proved to be unsuitable for recording; for example, it is sometimes impossible to place a recorder so as to record both speakers (e.g., postal services), the conversations were very short (e.g., supermarket checkouts), the conversations included too much personal data (e.g., conversations with a customer in a bank), the discourse was confidential (business meetings), etc. Secondly, even after arranging settings suitable for recording, potential speakers rarely responded positively to our requests. The list of final settings of non-public non-private recordings is as follows: formal work meetings, informal work meetings, university office hours, services (hairdresser, dentist, physiotherapist, etc.), information (energy saving, tourist information, etc.), sales (bicycle store, jewellery, health products, etc.), consulting (in a kindergarten), and office (secretary in a faculty department). 3 Corpus transcription Most reference corpora consist of orthographic transcriptions supplemented by phonetically transcribed material. This is the case with the Spoken Dutch Corpus, where broad phonetic transcriptions are available for the entire corpus, but only part of them are manually verified (Oostdijk et al. 2002 ). The Italian corpus CLIPS consists of orthographically transcribed material accompanied by semi-automated phonetic annotations (Savy and Cutugno 2009 ). The Corpus of Spoken Slovak contains orthographic transcriptions, phonetic annotations obtained with automatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, and a suprasegmental annotation scheme providing a mechanism for indicating syllable boundaries and stress markings (Rusko and Garab X   X  k 2007 ). The Olomouc Corpus of Spoken Czech is transcribed by a dual system of orthographic transcription, in order to facilitate automatic tagging, and a phonetic version of the transcript that reflects all of the important aspects of spoken Czech (Por  X   X   X  zka 2009 ). The spoken component of the British National Corpus has been orthographically transcribed (Burnard 2007 ). The corpus of Romance languages C-ORAL-ROM (Cresti et al. 2004 ) and the Brazilian corpus C-ORAL BRASIL (Mello and Raso 2009 ) provide an orthographic transcription enriched with the tagging of terminal and non-terminal prosodic breaks and annotations of non-standard pronunciation. The Swedish Go  X  teborg Spoken Language Corpus is transcribed in standard orthography, except where there are different spoken language pronunciations of a word (Allwood et al. 2000 ). The Corpus of Spoken Israeli Hebrew CoSIH provides transcriptions in standard Hebrew orthography, but some recordings are also supplied with phonetic transcriptions (Izre X  X l et al. 2001 ).

The transcription system of the Slovene corpus GOS includes a two-level transcription system, pronunciation-based and standardized (see Sect. 3.2 ), which is (to our knowledge) the first such solution for transcribing speech. 3.1 Meta-data GOS corpus meta-data are provided on various levels:  X  Name of the corpus, edition, information about the project, authors, distributor  X  Information about the transcriber, filename of the associated audio, version and  X  Information about the speakers: ID code, gender, age, education, region (or  X  Information about the communication situation: discourse type (public, non- X  Discourse structure: segments/utterances (rather short semantically autonomous  X  Speech transcription: in addition to standardized and pronunciation-based  X  Time sequences for text-to-audio alignment based on the level of segments/  X  Tokenization, lemmatization and POS-tagging (all done purely automatically
This meta-data structure covers most of the EAGLES ( 1996 ) and TEI (Burnard and Bauman 2007 ) recommendations for transcriptions of speech in spoken corpora.
In the transcription process, most of the data were entered via the Transcriber tool (Barras et al. 2000 ), used for transcription. The output of the transcription process was therefore Transcriber XML-based trs files. Information about the speakers and the communication situation were entered in separate txt files, as Transcriber does not enable entry of all of the types data we had decided to record. The final corpus format, covering all corpus data in one file, along with tokenization, lemmatization and POS tagging, is the TEI corpus file (Erjavec 2010 ). 3.2 Speech transcription The main objectives of the transcription system were:  X  To keep the transcription conventions simple and easy to learn, in order to  X  To maintain the richness of the various layers of spoken Slovene, in order to  X  To enable automatic lemmatization, morphosyntactic tagging, parsing, and
Slovene spoken language is known for strong vocal reduction, rich varieties in pronunciation and numerous dialects (46). As the GOS corpus covers speech from all Slovene dialect regions, we had to deal with rich phonetic and morphosyntactic variations, which are usually studied in dialectology. 2 In order to satisfy all of the objectives specified above, phonetic and orthographic transcription would be necessary; however, manual phonetic transcription of the whole corpus would be too time consuming and costly, while, due to the rich speech variations, automatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion would not satisfy the quality criteria. We therefore created a two-level system of orthographic transcription: pronunciation-based and standardized. We found that such a system was very efficient and useful for languages with a great variety of dialects, such as Slovene.

Pronunciation-based transcription is not made in the phonetic alphabet, but with the characters of the Slovene orthographic system. This indicates neither the stress position, nor the length (e.g., a: vs. a 3 ) or quality (e.g., E: vs. e:) of the vowel. The main rule was to follow the realized acoustic forms of words as faithfully as possible. 4 In Slovene, very few special exceptions to this general rule were needed, because Slovene orthographic conventions have a very direct grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Special instructions were only needed for the reduced vowel @, the semi-vowel U and some dialect-specific diphthongs. Detailed instructions are available in a PDF file on the corpus web page. Table 2 shows an example of the diversity of existing realizations of a standard form, as well as the differences between the phonetic transcription and the pronunciation-based transcription.
The standardized transcription follows the Slovene written standard and offers a common form for different pronunciation realizations of the same word form. The main rule for the standardization process was to eliminate phonetic changes (reductions, regionally conditioned voices, etc.) and provide a standard version of the same lexeme (see the example of lahko in Table 2 ). Morphological characteristics of words (case, gender, number, etc.) are strictly maintained in the standardized form; however, a colloquial morphological pattern can be replaced by a standardized pattern (e.g., the colloquial boma  X  X e will X  is replaced by the standard bova ). If a colloquial form is a conjugation of two standard lexemes (e.g., the colloquial nam  X  X  won X  X  X  vs. the standard ne bom  X  X  will not X ), it is replaced by a standard form. If a specific lexeme does not exist in the Slovene spoken standard, the colloquial lexeme is maintained as it is (e.g., the colloquial gate for the standard hlac  X  e  X  X rousers X ). All colloquial phenomena on the syntactical level are also maintained in the standardized transcription. More detailed instructions are standardization rules very generally in order to make efficient guidelines for the numerous different examples that we had to deal with, but it was still sometimes extremely difficult to recognize and consistently handle particular phenomena. For example, in the central Slovene regions, the colloquial form k is commonly used for different forms such as the standard ko  X  X hen X , ki  X  X hich X , or ker  X  X ecause X . In the eastern regions, the form ka is used in a similar way to the central k ; however, it is used also for the standard da  X  X hat X . Special discussions were needed during the transcription process to deal with such examples. 3.3 Attaining quality The high quality of the corpus was ensured by:  X  The use of computer tools wherever possible, enabling transcribers to click pre- X  A three-step transcription process:  X  Final checking of the meta-data: the information about the speakers and the  X  Final corrections of errors discovered when converting the data to the web-
Lemmatization and POS-annotation was added automatically. Regarding the first step, in the GOS-corpus project we did not foresee any special costs for manual inspection of the POS-tags; this task therefore remains for a future project. 3.4 Experiences with transcribing The GOS corpus consists of 115 h or 7,000 min of spoken Slovene, all transcribed in both pronunciation-based and standardized format. The pronunciation-based transcription was undertaken by a team of 20 transcribers. Whenever possible, the transcribers transcribed recordings that they had made themselves, or at least recordings that had been made in their dialect region. Their work also included preparing information about the recordings and speakers, segmentation of the signal, and labelling the personal data in the corpus. Transcribers needed an average of 1 h to label and transcribe 2 min of recorded speech.

The standardized transcription followed the pronunciation-based transcription. It was performed by a single, highly qualified person, who also participated in the elaboration of the standardization rules. In the first step, the pronunciation-based transcriptions were transformed semi-automatically, and in the second step they were manually examined and corrected. During the standardization process, additional questions concerning the standardization rules emerged (such as the example of k and ka described above) and were discussed, which led to some modifications of the standardization rules. 4 Usage 4.1 Overview of existing tools for accessing spoken corpora The main findings of an overview of existing corpus tools, with a particular focus on the interfaces or tools for accessing spoken corpora, are: 1.

The findings of a survey conducted among users of the FidaPLUS corpus (Arhar 2007 ), the reference corpus of Slovene at the time, concerning the usage and user-friendliness of the corpus interface, were also useful. Although this is not a spoken corpus, the research provided an understanding of how some of our target users (the respondents to the survey were university students and language professionals such as teachers, translators, and proofreaders) use and experience corpus tools. The most relevant findings were that users most often use a simple search function, they want a user-friendly, easy-to-use and intuitive interface, and they appreciate tips and help regarding the use of the tool. 4.2 Online tool for searching the GOS corpus The target audience of the GOS corpus includes researchers of speech (e.g., in the field of linguistics, phonetics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, language technologies), teachers of Slovene, and professionals such as proofreaders, writers, translators, etc. The group of target users is thus very heterogeneous, both in terms of their needs and their skills. A decision was made to design an online tool for searching the GOS corpus that is primarily targeted at less proficient users of corpora, with little or no experience of using corpus tools. This did not result in a significant loss of functionality, but simply emphasized the user-friendliness of the tool X  X  interface, so that less proficient users would have no difficulty understanding and using it.
Compared to interfaces of other corpus tools, the interface is minimalistic, stripped of any unnecessary information. It is freely accessible at www. korpus-gos.net (see Fig. 1 ). The similarity of the interface screen with search engines such as Google and Bing is intentional, as the users are very likely to have experience in using search engines, which should make them more confident and motivated in using the interface. The user-friendliness of the tool is further enhanced by the fact that users are provided with tips and hints for every part of the tool. Furthermore, there is a special Help tab containing the User Manual, with short explanations of functions, supported by screenshots.

The GOS tool has several functions that are more or less standard in corpus tools for accessing spoken and written corpora, including various types of search, e.g., search by word or phrase, (advanced) search by special speech event (e.g., laughter, pause), grammatical characteristics of a word (e.g., word class, gender, case), and/or by word in context, negative search (excluding words and conditions specified in the query), and search by using wildcard symbols * (matches one or more characters) and ? (matches any single character). In addition, there are functions such as Key Word in Context (KWIC) concordance output, detailed information about the utterance (e.g., source, year, speaker) accessed by clicking on the concordance line, Sort (by the search word, or by left/right context), Save (for saving the results to one X  X  computer), Print, and Search history.

In terms of content, it was paramount to include the source of spoken corpora, namely audio recordings, thus enabling the users to access the audio recordings associated with the transcriptions displayed in their search results. Audio and transcriptions were matched at utterance level, and utterance was also used as the unit displayed in the concordance.

Another function, tailored to the structure of the GOS corpus, is the option to search in both types of transcription used for the corpus, i.e., pronunciation-based and standardized transcription, the latter being provided to facilitate searching by unifying different realizations of the same form. However, the standardized form is used for searches only; the results are always displayed in the pronunciation-based form.
 Particular mention should be made of two other functions: List search and Filters. List search provides the user with a list of words (in pronunciation-based spelling) related to the query, along with information on the standardized form and frequency. One of the main reasons for designing List search was to give users quick access to a list of different pronunciation-based realizations associated with a particular standardized form. Lists are directly linked with the concordancer via frequency information, so users can view the concordances for any item on the list by clicking on the frequency information.

Filters were added in order to avoid immediately burdening users with having to specify various additional conditions for their search; instead, this procedure is postponed until after the results are displayed. A similar approach is found in internet browsers, the difference being that the GOS interface allows the selection of multiple categories in each filter. Filters in the GOS tool (see Fig. 1 ) allow users to filter the results according to metatextual information about the discourse characteristics and the speakers, and according to grammatical characteristics (e.g., lemma form, word class). Filters also act as frequency summarizers, because they offer a quick overview of the frequency distribution of the searched item across the filter categories.

The interface is written using ASP.NET MVC 3 technology and runs on an IIS 7 server (Windows Server 2008). The corpus data is stored in Microsoft SQL Server 2008. In order to facilitate easier corpus searches, the data is also indexed on the Solr4 search platform, for which we have developed some of our own search components. Solr 4 runs on an Apache Tomcat 6 web server (Windows Server 2008). 4.3 Availability of the original GOS files The GOS corpus is available in three different modes or formats. In addition to online use within the online concordancing tool, it is also available as a dataset intended for professional linguistic use and for language technologies. For the latter, two formats have been produced, the TEI P5 XML format (Erjavec 2010 ) and a double set of Transcriber files (.trs), the first of which contains pronunciation-based transcriptions while the second contains standardized transcriptions. However, the version in XML also includes additional linguistic annotation, such as lemmas and POS-tags for each token, specified within the JOS project (Erjavec et al. 2010 ). Both datasets are available under the Creative Commons license (Attribution-Non-Commercial-ShareAlike) and can be downloaded from two websites: the Communication in Slovene project website and the website of the GOS concord-ancer. Audio files of public discourse are also available on the basis of an individual licence, which requires signing a special contract between the user and the distributing body, in this particular case the leading institution of the Communi-cation in Slovene project consortium, the Amebis d.o.o. software company. 5 Conclusions We have described the 1-million-word GOS corpus of spoken Slovene, the process of its compilation, the structure of the corpus, its transcription system, final encoding format, and the newly developed online concordancing tool. The GOS corpus project is the first large scale spoken corpus project for Slovene. As such, it inevitably sets standards for future compilation of spoken corpora of Slovene. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge the important lessons that have been learnt in the process. One rather difficult issue is the question of personal data protection. Different European states enforce different legal obligations and Slovene laws are rather strict in this respect. This is one of the reasons that only audio files of public discourse type are available for distribution. Related to the legal issues is the question of spontaneity of conversations labelled as private discourse type. Because of strict laws, the participants had to sign an agreement before the actual recording and there could be no remedy for somewhat limited spontaneity because of prior knowledge of the recording. It was decided, however, that the availability of the material is more important than the possible (and to some extent unpredictable) spontaneity issues. On the other hand, the public discourse part of the corpus does not suffer from this drawback as it was collected from previously recorded material. After the assessment of the material, the prevailing opinion in the project was that the decision was the correct one.

Another difficult issue is the question of phonetic transcription. The primary goal of the umbrella Communication of Slovene project was to form an empirical basis for the future linguistic descriptions of Slovene, as well as to provide data and applications for language technologies for Slovene. On the other hand, it was also considered important to provide user-friendly web services which could be used by general public and in education. In this respect, formal phonetic transcription was considered of lesser importance than the two-level system of transcription described above. However, it was also considered of extreme importance to ensure the possibility that any number of annotation levels can be added to the existing ones. As a result, considerable effort was put into the final XML version of the corpus which we expect will be upgraded in the future project involving phonetic transcription of Slovene.

When making comparisons with the existing speech corpora for other languages, it is important to emphasize that the most interesting novelty of the GOS corpus is perhaps in its two-level transcription system: pronunciation-based and standardized. It might provide a model suitable particularly for languages similar to Slovene, i.e., with rich dialect distribution and, on the other hand, with a more or less direct grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. The pronunciation-based transcription basically provides a link between the more rigorous phonetic transcription and the standard orthographic transcription. In this way, it is suitable for use by general public and in information on phonetic characteristics of the spoken language. The first reactions of the general public show that it has been received with enthusiasm.

We expect that in the future the corpus will be extensively used in research and in education, in addition to its existing use within the language technologies field. However, it is important to emphasize that the size of the corpus is at the lower end of the standard size of spoken corpora, at least for official European languages. And after the process of compilation has been established and tested, it is only rational to upgrade the corpus both in its size and coverage, something that we expect will happen in the next years. Similarly, the corpus concordancer should be continuously improved and upgraded, based on user logs and user feedback.
