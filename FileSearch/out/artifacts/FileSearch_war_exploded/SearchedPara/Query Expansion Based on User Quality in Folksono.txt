 As the online social networks develop (e.g., Flikr, Del.icio.us, Bibsonomy, etc [1-2]), trieve online web resources through tagging behaviors, then rises. In folksonomy, the online web resources are defined as resources, the tags attached resources are defined many researchers on various fields. 
At the same time, query expansion has been widely used during search to meet us-er X  X  real information need. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) as one of the effective methods of query expansion, is based on the assumption that the top-ranked docu-could improve the performance for query expansion through mining better expansion terms. However, annotations are always informal and irregular in folksonomy. In other words, not all the annotations can be treated as good expansion terms. So it is essential to achieve more appropriate annotations as good expansion terms. 
To solve the problem mentioned above, we propose a novel query expansion me-thod based on social annotations with users X  quality information added. We attain this goal by mining high quality users in folksonomy systems, because we believe that the sources, which have a larger possibility to be good expansion terms when working for contribute a lot to query expansion. 
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) we propose a tagging behavior and the mutual reinforcement relationship; 2) we explore two me-thods to apply user quality to query expansion in folksonomy through extensive expe-riments, which help select better expansion terms. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses some related query expansion approach with user information added. Then the details of our expe-riment and the performance of the new approach are reported in section 4. Finally, the conclusion and some future works are presented in Section 5. retrieval models attaching to PRF, such as vector space model [10], probabilistic model [11], relevance model [12], mixture model [13], etc. 
With the development of the social networks, more and more researches shift their perspective towards social annotations application. Recommendation [14], semantic Web [15], Web search [1, 16, 17] as different kinds of social annotation applications tripartite network model of folksonomy to discover the relationship between annota-resources are always appear associated with each other. When analyzing different entities in the social network, the mutual reinforce relationship is useful and effective. 
Afterwards, Hotho et al. [16] propose FolkRank algorithm, which is based on Pa-geRank [18] and random walk model. So does Social PageRank, proposed by Bao et annotations, and resources to analyze the relationship of every two entities. Noll et al. [19] propose a graph-based algorithm, named Spamming-resistant Expertise Analysis and Ranking (SPEAR), which meets the view that the user who tags a resource first has more chance to be an expert, which is inherited in this paper to mining user quality. 
Recently Lin et al. [7] indicate that annotations are good resources for query expan-sion. Following the theory, we propose a novel query expansion approach based on user quality affect the expansion terms chosen from annotations for query expansion. The query expansion based on high quality users approach focuses on mining user quality to achieve better expansion terms, thus improving the performance of query by means of a novel user quality computation metric proposed in this paper based on the FolkRank and the SocialPageRank algorithm; the later, selects appropriate annota-known co-occurrence method with user quality integrated. 3.1 User Quality Computation principle: user (resp., user to resource). The iterative process will not stop until results get con-vergent. The basic framework of the algorithm is similar with SocialPageRank and FolkRank. They are all based on the random walk model and the classic PageRank algorithm[18]. The convergence of them can be proved in a similar way. In our expe-riment, the algorithm converges within 10 times of iterations in our experiments. 
In addition, we inherit the demonstrated idea that the earlier a user annotating a re-source, the more likely the user being the high quality one. So the calculation for user quality is mixed with tagging time. We sort users for specific resource and annotation according to the sequencing, where n is the number of users who annotate the given time score, and the last one is assigned 1. users who tagged high quality resources earliest will receive rather high quality scores avoid the situation, we control the effect of the time score by receiving the square root of the time score through a number of experiments to make the first user of a resource score more appropriate to be different from other users instead of too high. matrix from users to resources and M RU be the N r  X  N u transition matrix from resources to users. Elements M UR ( u i ,r j ) and M RU ( u i ,r j ) are assigned as follows: represents how exactly the annotation a generalizes the resource r , the specific com-putation of which as equation (3); p ( a|u ) is the generative probability for annotation a from user u which represents u X  X  interest which is computed as equation (4). Then the tagging time is attached to the iterative calculation of the user quality. 
After iteration, each user is weighted by a score which measures the contribution of user X  X  tagging behavior, and we call it Quality Score (QS for short) in this paper. The good expanded terms. 3.2 Expansion Terms Selection The term co-occurrence is usually used to measure how often terms appear together in the text window. In our experiment, it helps measure the frequency of annotations and query terms appearing together, and the whol e content of a resource works as the text compose the resource set R j . Then, expansion terms are selected from R j . QS is applied in expansion terms selected procedure, and there are two means to achieve this goal. resource can be measured as equation (5), which is called Resource Score ( RS for short): is the annotation set for annotations which are used to tag the given resource r . Hence, the returned resources from the initial retrieval are re-ranked by RS. The top ment according to the traditional co-occurrence metric (Lin et al. [7]). Adding User Quality in to Co-occurrence Metric. By means of integrating QS to modify the traditional co-occurrence metric, we apply user quality selecting better expansion terms, which is the second way to use user quality. We have tried a number of metric to observe the result, and the best one resulted from the metric below: where QS(u, a) aims at weighting the annotation used by high quality user higher than the one used by other users when we select expansion terms. 
Then, based on the assumption that terms in the document are independent from each other, the expansion terms are sel ected according to th e equation below. cording to equation (7) compose the new expanded query Q exp with the corresponding original query Q . The proportional distribution of the expansion terms and the corres-ponding original query Q is control by a parameter  X  . 4.1 Data Description In our experiment, the dataset is collected from Del.icio.us and consists of 4414 users, 41204 resources and 28733 annotations in total, which is the same with [20]. The data which share the same stem get together; second, some annotations are made up by several words, such as  X  java/programming  X ,  X  java_programming  X , and so on. We divide these annotations into several words with the help of the delimiters. 
The expansion procedure is conducted on the delicious data set, and retrieval pro-cedure is conducted on three standard TREC collections, AP88-90(Associated Press), started in 2003) are also needed in our experiment. The detail information of the three collections we conduct experiment on in our paper lists in Table 1. 4.2 Experimental Settings The retrieval procedure is conducted based on the Indri 2.6 search engine which serves as the basic retrieval system. The performance is measured mainly by Mean Average Precision (MAP) for top 1000 documents retrieved from the three TREC collections, meanwhile, P@n also assists to evaluate the retrieval results which means the precision in top n result lists for retrieval. 
For the first method to add user quality, we get M returned resources for the initial resources are re-ranked according to RS, from which we pick up N topmost resources expansion terms. In this paper, the parameters are setting as Table 2. tions are selected from the N resources in the initial retrieval according to the equa-tion (7) and then compose the expanded query Q exp . The specific parameter settings of this paper are shown in Table 3. 
Parameters in our experiment are tuned through simple variable method. Figure 1 and 2 show the performance varies with parameters  X  and M on three TREC collec-tions in the condition of other parameters fixed. Figure 1 displays the MAP on differ-ent weights for original query, when  X  is larger than 0.5, the performance drops with  X  increasing. Figure 2 do n terms K. With increasing o afterwards.

Table 4 shows that our m though a little. The reason ging behavior as the SPE A tionship between the users a Evaluation on Query Expansion Based on Our User Quality Mining Approach. Table 5-7 display MAP, P@5, P@10 and P@20 of retrieving 1000 documents by various approaches, among which QL denotes the Query Likelihood Model retrieval using original query; PRFSA is the retrieval after the query expansion based on social annotations using PRF method, which serves as our baseline; SATUSER1 and SATUSER2 are the retrieval with the query which is expended from social annotations and then added user quality and time information in two methods respectively. 
As we have seen, PRFSA gets much improvement comparing with the performance of retrieval with original query. Obviously, through integrating user quality into query expansion procedure, the expansion achieves much better performance. In addition, SATUSER1 shows better results than SATUSER2. To analyze the reason, we find that through modifying co-occurrence metric, a large amount of attempt is needed to discover the best compound mode for the metric and Quality Score. However, due to the limit of conditions, we cannot test every combinatory formula. While by means of directly. As a result, the performance is better. 
SATUSER1 and SATUSER2 show relatively obvious increasing in MAP of re-trieval on AP and WSJ collections, however, on Robust 2004 collection, the increas-ing is small. Then we carefully studied th e content of the three TREC collections and kinds of format documents. Because of the irregular document formats, some noise cannot be eliminated during retrieval. As we all see, the baseline doesn X  X  achieve sig-nificant improvement, either. So the performance of query expansion using user quali-ty doesn't show very prominent improvement. 
Through analyzing the expansion terms, we find the way the user quality operates experiments show the improvement in query expansion with user quality added, and then we can conclude that user quality is indeed helpful for query expansion. sion. We propose an algorithm to obtain user quality in folksonomy, and further dem-proved beneficial to select annotations wh ich are more relevant to the corresponding original query as expansion terms, thus improving query expansion performance. The way it works can be summarized as two methods: the first is to re-rank and filter the returned resources from the initial retrieval by user quality; the second is to integrate user quality into the co-occurrence metric to weight expansion terms by user quality. quality in query expansion. What X  X  more, community can be introduced to perfect the pansion procedure. In addition, we will explore more applications of user information. Acknowledgment.
