 In nowadays social networks, a huge volume of content con-taining rich information, such as reviews, ratings, microblogs, etc., is being generated, consumed and diffused by users all the time. Given the temporal information, we can obtain the event cascade which indicates the time sequence of the arrival of information to users. Many models have been pro-posed to explain how information diffuses. However, most existing models cannot give a clear explanation why every specific event happens in the event cascade. Such explana-tion is essential for us to have a deeper understanding of information diffusion as well as a better prediction of future event cascade.

In order to uncover the mechanism of the happening of social events, we analyze the rating event data crawled from Douban.com, a Chinese social network, from year 2006 to 2011. We distinguish three factors: social, external and intrinsic influence which can explain the emergence of ev-ery specific event. Then we use the mixed Poisson pro-cess to model event cascade generated by different factors respectively and integrate different Poisson processes with shared parameters. The proposed model, called Combina-tional Mixed Poisson Process (CMPP) model, can explain not only how information diffuses in social networks, but also why a specific event happens. This model can help us to understand information diffusion from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. We develop an efficient Clas-sification EM algorithm to infer the model parameters. The explanatory and predictive power of the proposed model has been demonstrated by the experiments on large real data sets.

Social networks have become an important medium for the emergence and diffusion of information. A huge volume of content is being generated and transmitted continuously in different social networks. Understanding information dif-fusion process from the huge volume of user-generated con-tent remains an important and challenging research prob-lem. Generally, a social event is defined as a user adopting a piece of content at a certain time. For example, in a review site, we can observe that a user rates or reviews a product at a certain time. However, why the user rates or reviews this product and how information related to the product dif-fuses in the network are unknown. Actually, answering the questions of  X  X hy X  is very essential to understand the nature of information diffusion and meaningful in real applications. For example, in viral marketing, knowing the concrete rea-son for the message spreading can help us to evaluate the viral potential of this message.

In the literature, many studies have been proposed to explain the underlying mechanism of information diffusion. Among them, [7, 9, 10] propose to construct an implicit net-work between users to explain the observed data. [13, 24] use the stochastic process to model the occurrences of events. [2] adopts embedding technique to map the observed data onto a continuous space. However, the existing works focus on constructing a model which can best describe the observed event cascade as a whole. Details related to the emergence and dissemination of every specific event are missing. For example, for a specific user and content, the current models cannot clearly explain why the user adopts the content at that time.

In order to answer the question  X  X hy it happened X , in this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model which aims to explain the emergence of every single event and the formation of event cascade simultaneously in social net-works. We distinguish three different factors which trigger an event to happen: social influence , external influence and intrinsic influence . Specifically, social influence causes an event to happen via the user X  X  social connections. External influence triggers an event under the influence of an external Figure 1: We distinguish three factors to explain the emergence of every social event. In the event cas-cade above, initially, user u 0 adopts content o 1 under external influence, and then u 1 adopts o 1 under so-cial influence of u 0 , and similarly u 2 adopts o 1 under social influence of u 1 .After u 1 adopts o 1 , u 1 adopts o 2 and o 3 under intrinsic influence. out-of-network source, such as newspapers, TV stations and online news sites. These two types of influence have been considered in some models [4, 19]. Interestingly, according to our data analysis on the real world social event data, an-other type of influence can significantly promote the emer-gence of events as well, but it has not been applied to model information diffusion in the existing literature. This kind of influence reflects user X  X  own preference over time. We call it intrinsic influence . Accordingly, an observed event cascade can be partitioned into three sub-event cascades triggered by the above three factors respectively. A sub-event cascade can be treated as a discrete event occurrence sequence over time. The Poisson process is a fundamental stochastic pro-cess to describe the occurrences of discrete events in a finite time interval [5]. Hence, we use the mixed Poisson process to model each sub-event cascade separately and propose a com-binational stochastic process to model the whole observed event cascade. We call this model C ombinational M ixed P oisson P rocess (CMPP). Figure 1 depicts an overview of our model and an example event cascade triggered by the three factors. We also design an efficient Classification EM algorithm to infer the parameters of our model. This infer-ence procedure can provide an explanatory mechanism to the happening of every event. Furthermore, we can apply the model to predict future event cascade.

The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce preliminary concepts in Section 2. Then we discuss how to model the event cascade using a combinational mixed Pois-sonprocessinSection3.InSection4wedesignaClassifica-tion EM algorithm to efficiently estimate the parameters of the CMPP model. Extensive experimental results are pre-sented in Section 5. We discuss related work in Section 6 and conclude the paper in Section 7.
An online social network can be modeled as a directed graph G ( U , V ), where U is the node set representing the users, and V is the edge set representing the user relation-ships. In addition, we use O to denote the set of user-generated content in the social network, such as ratings, tweets, or reviews.

An event is defined as a triple e u, o, t which indicates that user u  X  X  adopts content o  X  X  at time t .The adopting behavior depends on the network and the content type, for instance, rating a product, retweeting a tweet, etc. An event cascade is a temporally ordered sequence of events, denoted as E =( e 1 ,e 2 ,... ), where  X  e i ,e j , t i &lt;t A subsequence of the event cascade observed before time T is denoted as E t e &lt;T =( e 1 ,e 2 ,...,e n ) where t n
From the event cascade, we can observe  X  X ho X ,  X  X hat X  and  X  X hen X  of every event. But two questions remain unknown: (1) why does an event happen? and (2) how does the event cascade form? To answer the first question, we distinguish three factors which can trigger an event to happen, that is, social influence , external influence ,and intrinsic influence . The three factors are introduced in details in the remainder of this section. To answer the second question, we will pro-pose a model to explain the formation of an event cascade in Section 3.
In social networks, individuals can be influenced by the actions taken by others. This phenomenon is known as social influence [1], and is defined as follows.

Definition 1. (Social Influence) Social influence is a social phenomenon that the action of individuals can induce their connections to act in a similar way. Figure 2: Illustration of the social event cascade for a single piece of content o . In this example, all users who have adopted o (in purple) except user u 0 are influenced by the previous event of the user X  X  friend. The purple arrows indicate the diffusion path. Here, the social event cascade is E soc =( e 1 ,e 2 ,e 3 ,e 4 ) .
A key issue is to quantify the social influence from a user to his followers. For this purpose, we define two variables: influence rate and infection rate foreachuserintheso-cial network according to the social impact theory [14]. The social impact theory regards an individual in a social com-munity as either the source or target of social influence. In the social network scenario, the user who causes an event to happen is the influence source, while the user who is affected by the event through the social relationship is the influence target.

For a source user, the social influence he brings by adopt-inganeventisquantifiedbythe influence rate ,whichis defined as follows.

Definition 2. (Influence Rate) For any user u  X  X  , the influence rate  X  u measures how likely user u  X  X  action can induce u  X  X  followers to act in a similar way.
The influence rate  X  u depends on the user u who causes the event to happen. For example, by adopting the same event, the influence caused by a famous person will be larger than by an ordinary user.

For a target user, the intention to adopt an event caused by the social influence is measured by the infection rate .
Definition 3. (Infection Rate) For any user u  X  X  , the infection rate r u measures the intention that the user tends to be influenced by the source he follows.
 Similarly, the infection rate also varies from user to user. Some users are more likely to be influenced by others, while others are less likely to be influenced. The social influence diffused over an edge of a social network is determined by both the influence rate of the source and the infection rate of the target.

If we select all the events caused by social influence from an event cascade E and sort them according to the temporal order, we get a subsequence of E .Wecallita social event cascade , denoted as E soc , where every event in E soc is caused by social influence. Figure 2 illustrates an example of the social event cascade for a single piece of content.
According to a recent study by [19, 4], a user can not only receive information through the links of the social network, but also through the influence of exogenous out-of-network sources, such as newspapers, TV stations, etc. The emer-gence of information in the social network can be explained by the influence of such external sources. This kind of influ-ence is so called external influence .

Definition 4. (External Influence) External influence is the impact generated by some out-of-network sources to induce social network users to adopt some content. Figure 3 depicts external influence observed from real data. We show the number of ratings from October 1, 2009 to June 1, 2011 for three popular movies: Avatar , Inception and Let the Bullets Fly . We can observe that a sudden peak appears in all three curves. This sudden peak indicates an explosive growth of the number of ratings. An interesting thing is that the corresponding date of each peak is exactly the premiere date of each movie in China. It is obvious that the premiere of a movie is a significant influence on users. Therefore the corresponding relation between the premiere date and the peak in the curve shows the signature that the exogenous sources can induce social network users to adopt some content.

Similar to social influence, we use the social impact theory to model external influence. In this case, all the users in social networks are targets. The source can be treated as a hidden node which connects to all the users. For each content o , we can define the external influence strength k as follows.

Definition 5. (External Influence Strength) For any content o  X  X  , the external influence strength k o measures how likely an external source related to o can affect all the users in the social network.
 Similarly, we define an external event cascade , denoted as E ext , as a subsequence of an event cascade E , where every event in E ext is caused by external influence. 2009 X 10 X 01 2011 X 06 X 01 # of ratings per day Figure 3: The number of ratings per day for three movies from October 1, 2009 to June 1, 2011. The corresponding date of the peak in each curve is ex-actly the premiere date of each movie.
Besides social influence and external influence which have been studied in the literature, user X  X  behavior may be in-fluenced by their preferences. Users may adopt some con-tent spontaneously based on their current interests or prefer-ences.Forexample,ifauserpostsatweetaboutanaction movie, he may post some related tweets afterwards, such as tweets on other action movies, or movies by the same director or the same leading actors. In this example, the subsequent event cascade of this user is neither triggered by his social connections nor by external influence. Instead, it is influenced by his own preferences. We call this kind of influence intrinsic influence .

Definition 6. (Intrinsic Influence) Intrinsic influence is the impact generated by the user X  X  preference which in-duces the user to adopt the content spontaneously. Figure 4: Heat map for the average interval in days between the ratings of two movies made by the same user. id 1-15 denote American cartoon movies, while id 16-30 denote Japanese cartoon movies. The aver-age interval of two movies which belong to the same category is much smaller than that of two movies which belong to different categories.

Intrinsic influence can induce users to adopt content which is similar to his previously adopted content. The effect of intrinsic influence on user behavior can be especially no-table within a short time window. To validate this claim, we select all the rating records of 15 movies (which have the largest number of ratings) tagged with  X  X merican Cartoon X  and  X  X apanese Cartoon X  respectively from Douban during January 10, 2010 and January 1, 2012. Then for any two movies, we find the users who have rated both movies and calculate the average interval between the two ratings in days. Figure 4 shows the heat map in which the color of each grid represents the average interval between two rat-ings. From Figure 4, we can observe that the area of movies with the same tag is much darker than the movies with dif-ferent tags. This shows that a previously rated movie would induce users to rate a movie with the same tag in a short period. This observation validates the claim that intrinsic influence can affect user behavior and cause rating events to happen in a short time window.

Intrinsic influence can be measured by the similarity of the two pieces of content. We define an intrinsic event cascade , denoted as E int , as a subsequence of an event cascade E , where every event in E int is caused by intrinsic influence. According to the three factors, the observed event cascade E t e &lt;T can be partitioned into three sub-event cascades E E ext and E int . We propose to model these three cascades separately, and then use a combinational model to combine them.

Theeventcascadecanbetreatedasadiscreteeventoc-currence sequence over time. The Poisson process is a fun-damental stochastic process to describe the occurrences of discrete events in a finite time interval [5]. Hence, for any event cascade E , we can model it using the Poisson process with the intensity function  X  ( t ). Different from the classi-cal Poisson process whose intensity is constant, the intensity function  X  ( t ) is time-dependent since the influence changes with time. For example, the event that happened one day ago would have more influence than a similar event that hap-pened one year ago. Thus, for social influence and intrinsic influence, we add a time decay function f ( X  t,  X  )tomodel the influence decrease over time. There are many parametric models to describe the influence decay [10]. In this paper, we adopt exponential model for social and intrinsic influence decay, i.e., f ( X  t,  X  )= e  X   X   X  t . For external influence, we use a numeric function M ( t ) to model the fluctuation of exter-nal influence. Since for any timestamp t , the observed event cascade E t e &lt;t is generated by a stochastic process and the rate of social influence and intrinsic influence depends on historical events, the Poisson processes to model E soc and E int are actually mixed Poisson process [5].

Based on the three separate models, we construct a combi-national stochastic process to describe the whole event cas-cade E with shared parameters. This stochastic process is called C ombinational M ixed P oisson P rocess(CMPP). In the following, we first introduce how to model these three sub-event cascades separately. Then we present the combi-national model to model the whole event cascade. Table 1 lists the notations used in the paper.
For any event e i u i ,o i ,t i , we use the intensity function  X  e i ( u ,t ) to quantify social influence of e i to a target user u at time t as: In (1),  X  u i is the influence rate of user u i , r u is the infec-tion rate of user u ,and  X   X  is the parameter to model the influence decay over time.

For the set of followers of u i , denoted as U u i , the total social influence caused by e i at time t is:
Then for any event e i  X  E t e &lt;t ,let E i be the event cascade caused by e i under social influence, and E soc = | E t e &lt;t Notation Description U user set O content set

The superposition of inde-pendent Poisson processes is also a Poisson process. Thus the social event cascade E soc can be generated by a Poisson process with the intensity function  X  soc ( t | E t e &lt;t
Hence, from the observed event cascade E t e &lt;t ,wecan calculate the intensity function  X  soc ( t | E t e &lt;t )atanytime t . According to the intensity function, we can generate the social event cascade E soc via the Poisson process.
Since the external source which triggers an event is usually unobserved in the social network, we use a numeric function M o ( t )in[0 , 1] to measure the base value of external influ-ence over time. Based on this function, we can define the intensity function  X  ext ( o, u, t )foruser u to content o at time t as: In (5), r u is the infection rate which reflects user u  X  X  intention to be influenced, and k o is the external influence strength of content o . The external event cascades triggered by different content are independent of each other. Thus the intensity function  X  ext ( t ) of the Poisson process which generates E is:
Similar to social influence, for a specific content o  X  X  and user u i , the intensity function  X  e i ( o, t ) of the intrinsic influence by a previous event e i u i ,o i ,t i to u i can be defined as: In (7),  X   X  is the time decay parameter. sim ( o i ,o )isthe similarity between the two pieces of content o i and o .A higher similarity indicates that the user is more likely to adopt the content o right after e i happens.

Similar to E soc , E int can be modeled by a Poisson process in
O , the intensity function  X  e i ( t, O )is: Therefore, E int can be generated by a Poisson process with the intensity function  X  int ( t | E t e &lt;t ):
Based on the three separate models corresponding to the three factors, we can construct a combinational model to model the whole event cascade. For the observed event cas-cade E t e &lt;T , we assume E is generated by a stochastic pro-cess X {U , O} ( t )asfollows: In (10), X {U , O} ( t ) consists of three Poisson processes PP ( which use the intensity function  X  ( t | X  )tomodeltheevent cascades E soc ,E ext ,E int generated by social influence, ex-ternal influence and intrinsic influence, respectively. The whole event cascade is the union of the three cascades, i.e., E
The three Poisson processes are not independent of each other, since from the definition,  X  soc ( t | E t e &lt;t are based on the historical events generated by X {U , O} Thus X {U , O} ( t ) is the combinational model to explain how the event cascade forms.
Based on the CMPP model described above, for any user u and content o , the intensity function  X  all ( u, o, t )ofuser u adopting content o at time t under the influence of the three factors is:  X  all ( u, o, t )= In (11), E o is the event cascade related to content o ,while E u is the event cascade generated by u .

From (11), for any event e j u j ,o j ,t j ,wecanwritethe probability density p ( e j | E t e &lt;t j ,  X ) as: In (12),  X  = {  X  , R ,  X  , K } is the parameter set of CMPP.  X  = {  X  u } u  X  X  is the influence rate set of users. R = { r is the infection rate set of users.  X  = {  X   X  , X   X  } is the de-cay parameter set. K = { k o } o  X  X  is the external influence strength set of content.

Therefore, for the observed event cascade E t e &lt;T , the joint probability density p ( E t e &lt;T |  X ) is:
The integral part in (12) can be computed analytically: where:
Based on the joint probability density function (13), given the observed event cascade E t e &lt;T , our target is to find the parameters set  X  to maximize the likelihood function L
We use the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm [3] to infer the parameter set in (17). Since it is very hard to infer the parameters from L ( E t e &lt;T |  X ) directly, for any event e assign a latent ( n +1)  X  1vector z j to indicate which event has triggered e j , n i =0 z j ( i )=1. z j ( i ) = 1 indicates that event e j is triggered by event e i .Here i is the index of event in E t e &lt;T . z j (0) = 1 means that event e j is triggered by external influence. Thus we can rewrite the intensity function  X  all ( u j ,o j ,t j , z j ) for event e j with and the joint log-likelihood function L ( E t e &lt;T , Z| event cascade E t e &lt;T and the latent variable set Z = as: = By adopting the CEM algorithm [3], we can infer the pa-rameters and the latent variables based on (19).
 E-step . Given the current parameters set  X  k  X  1 ,wecom-pute the posterior distribution of z j : p ( C-step . In order to find the major factor that causes an event to happen, for any z j ,weassign z j ( i )=1which provides the maximum posterior probability of (20). That is: M-step . We estimate the parameter set  X  in the M-step. Indeed, we use the well-known coordinate descent method to infer the influence rate  X  , the infection rate R and the external influence strength K . We find the partial derivative analytically. Thus the updating rules for parameters are as follows:
For the decay parameter  X  ,  X  L  X  X  = 0 cannot be computed analytically. We adopt the Newton X  X  method to calculate  X  and  X   X  [13].
 We present the procedure of model parameter inference in Algorithm 1.

Initialize Z (0) , X  (0) while not converged do end while Our experiment is conducted on two real world data sets: Douban 1 [25] and Epinions 2 .

Douban data set . Douban is a Chinese SNS website allowing users to generate and share information such as ratings and reviews related to movies, books, etc. This data set contains three components: (1) social network structure including users and their follow relationship, (2) user rating records with timestamp which is measured by days from year 2006 to 2011, and (3) movie information such as directors and categories. We extract the tag set of each movie and use the Jaccard Coefficient on the tag set to measure the similarity between movies. Meanwhile, we use the movie name as the keyword to query the Google Trends data of the target period as the reference of external influence. The intuition is that the strength of external influence can be reflected by the search volume in the Internet. As prepro-cessing, we filter users who adopted less than 30 events and movies which appeared in less than 1000 events.

Epinions data set . Epinions is a consumer review site which helps users make the purchase decisions. This data set contains three components: (1) trust/distrust relation-ship between users, (2) user rating records for the articles with timestamp which is measured by days from year 2001 to 2003, and (3) author and subject information of the ar-ticles. We extract the social network structure from the trust statement made by users. If user u i trusts user u we consider there exists an edge from u i to u j in the social network. Then we utilize the Jaccard Coefficient to mea-sure the similarity between articles based on the author and http://www.douban.com http://www.trustlet.org/wiki/Extended Epinions dataset subject information. Since the textual content of articles is not available in this data set, we cannot search any exter-nal source to evaluate external influence. In order to address this problem, we randomly divide the data set into two parts: the experimental part (80%) and the reference part (20%). We use the experimental part to conduct our experiment and the reference part as the reference of external influence. For any article o at time period [ t, t + X  t ], we use the ratio of users who have rated article o during [ t, t + X  t ]versus users who have not rated o at time t to represent external influence during [ t, t + X  t ] for article o . As preprocessing, we filter users who adopted less than 10 events and articles which were rated less than 200 times.
 Table 2 lists the statistics of these two data sets.
We conduct the experiment on the Douban data set to demonstrate the explanatory power of our model. We apply our CMPP model on the event cascades in Douban, which gives a label to every event indicating the influence factor that triggers the event. For each movie, we identify the specific event cascade in which all events are re-lated to this movie from the whole event cascade. Then we calculate the percentage of events triggered by external influ-ence, intrinsic influence and social influence for each movie related event cascade, respectively. The mean and variance of percentage of the three event types over all event cas-cades in Douban are plotted in Figure 5. We can make the following observations: Figure 5: The mean and variance of percentage of each event type over all event cascades in Douban.
Since the proportion of intrinsic and social influence varies greatly from content to content, different diffusion patterns may exist for different types of content. In order to in-spect the details of the diffusion pattern, firstly we conduct a case study. We compare the event cascades of four movies observed during March 2010 -September 2010: 12 Angry Men(12ANG) (1957), Mulholland Drive(MD) (2001), How to Train Your Dragon(HTYD) (2010) and Echoes of The Rainbow(ETR) (2010). The first two movies are old ones, while the other two are new in the observed period as they were released in March 2010. The event type breakdown is shown in Figure 6. We have the following observations.
We plot the detailed event cascade structure of these four movies in Figure 7. Here, a point represents an event, i.e., a user rating/reviewing a movie, and the color of the point indicates the type of influence that triggers this event. If an event influences another through the social connection, we add an arrow pointing from the source to the target. Figure 8 gives a zoom-in plot of the social diffusion path between events for the movie HTYD . From these figures, we can clearly observe the different diffusion processes of the two old movies and two new movies as discussed above. Figure 6: The event type breakdown of four movies.
From the previous case study we find that some event cas-cades are dominated by social influence, while some others are dominated by intrinsic influence. We call them social dominated event cascade and intrinsic dominated event cas-cade , respectively. Indeed, these two types of event cascades exhibit very different diffusion patterns. In this experiment, these two types of event cascades are compared analytically.
For an event cascade, we define the i/s ratio as the ratio between the number of intrinsic influence triggered events and the number of social influence triggered events. Then we pick 50 event cascades with the smallest i/s ratio, and an-other 50 event cascades with the largest i/s ratio. The first set with i/s ratio &lt; 1 corresponds to the social dominated event cascades, and the second set with i/s ratio &gt; 1 corre-sponds to the intrinsic dominated event cascades. We plot the normalized cumulative frequency of events over time in an event cascade in Figure 9(a) and (b) for the social dom-inated and intrinsic dominated event cascades respectively. Figure 8: Zoom-in plot of the social diffusion paths for HTYD .WecanobservemanyDAGsasthedif-fusion paths of this content in the original social graph.

Clearly these two figures exhibit very different event growth patterns. For the social dominated event cascades, there is a sharp increase in the number of events, or burst, at a cer-tain time point. The explosive growth can be explained by the strong and widespread social influence. In contrast, for the intrinsic dominated event cascades, the growth of events over time is steady and smooth. This is because user behav-ior is induced by user X  X  intrinsic influence. It is not likely to cause a burst in the social network.

Identifying these two types of event cascades is very essen-tial for real applications, such as long tail recommendation, popular event detection, viral marketing, etc. Our CMPP model can naturally distinguish these two types of event cascades and give a sound explanation.
According to Figure 5, it is interesting to see that intrin-sic influence is the major factor of the event emergence in Douban data. This result proves that intrinsic influence is very important and cannot be ignored in information diffu-sion. On the other hand, such high proportion of intrinsic influence triggered events may be partially attributed to a Figure 9: The normalized cumulative frequency curve. (a) The social dominated event cascades. (b) The intrinsic dominated event cascades. In (a) we can observe an explosive growth of the number of events while the growth in (b) is steady and smooth. feature in Douban. That is, users can easily jump from one movie to another through links such as  X  X ovie by the same director X , or  X  X eople who like this movie also like X .
Table 3 lists four popular diffusion path examples trig-gered by intrinsic influence identified by our model. By  X  X opular X  we mean each transition from one movie to an-other in these paths is adopted by at least 45 users in the Douban data set.
In this experiment, we show the event type breakdown in the event cascades in Douban, and compare the differ-ent diffusion patterns of the event cascades of four movies, which are dominated by intrinsic influence and social influ-ence respectively. Through the explanatory experiment, we demonstrate that our CMPP model can provide accurate ex-planation to two important questions: (1) how information diffuses in the social network; and (2) which factor triggers a single event to happen. Such concrete explanation reveals the subtle structure and the growth pattern of an event cas-cade, leading to a deeper understanding of the information diffusion process.
In this experiment, we apply our CMPP model for future event cascade prediction on the Douban and Epinions data sets to demonstrate the predictive power of our model. The event cascade prediction problem is defined as:
Definition 7. (Event Cascade Prediction) Event cas-cade prediction is to predict the future event cascade E T in time [ T,T + X  t ) , based on the observed event cascade E
More specifically, in our experiment, we aim to predict the content set O u [ T,T + X  t ) that user u adopts in [ T,T + X  t ). The prediction can be regarded as a retrieval task. For each user u , our model returns a content list L u sorted in the descending order of probability which indicates how likely user u will adopt this content in [ T,T + X  t ). The probabil-ity is calculated according to the parameter set  X  which is
We use Mean Average Precision (MAP) to evaluate the prediction performance similar to [2]. We define P u,k as the precision at rank k in L u ,i.e.,thepercentageoftruepositive content among the top k pieces of content in L u .Thus,the MAP is defined as: In (24),  X  ( o, L u ) indicates the rank of content o in L indicates the number of elements in the target set.
From each data set, we extract the event cascade E T  X   X   X  in [ T  X   X   X ,T ) as the training event cascade, and the event cascade E T  X  t e &lt;T + X  t in [ T,T + X  t )asthetesteventcas-cade. Here  X   X  is the training interval and  X  t is the test interval. The experimental configuration for the two data sets is shown in Table 4.

We compare our CMPP model with the following infor-mation diffusion models.
In order to reduce the influence of sampling, we select 5 different timestamps for the parameter T to extract the training and test event cascades. Table 5 reports the MAP results for each test case on the two data sets. The row  X  X verage X  reports the average MAP performance for all the casesoneachdataset.

As shown in Table 5, our model CMPP consistently and significantly outperforms the other models on all the cases of these two data sets. The superior performance demonstrates the predictive power of our model. The poor predictive per-formance of the other two models can be explained by the following reasons.

There are many existing studies related to information diffusion in online social networks, which can be classified into two main categories: (1) graph-explanatory model and (2) graph-predictive model.

Graph-explanatory model . The graph-explanatory model treats the social network structure as a strong prior for in-formation diffusion. Independent Cascades (IC) [6, 21] and Linear Threshold (LT) [15] are two seminal models. The two models view the happening of events in different ways, i.e., the IC model is sender-dominated, while the LT model is receiver-dominated. Various extensions to these two models have been proposed, such as AsIC and AsLT [20], which in-corporate temporal information. [17] considers both positive and negative relationships in a social network to solve the influence diffusion and maximization problems. [12] models the characteristics of sender and receiver in the diffusion si-multaneously. [22] integrates the node attributes to estimate the diffusion probability. [11, 16] consider the event content to extract more information to infer the diffusion patterns. [19] considers both the endogenous and exogenous influence to model the diffusions.

Graph-predictive model . The graph-predictive model ignores the social network structure and infers the implicit connections between users only based on the observed event cascade. [7, 9] focus on estimating the transmission rate between users to best explain the observed data. [10] ex-tends the model in [7] and estimates the structure and the temporal dynamics of the network. [8] aims to infer the in-dividual transmissions to trace the paths of news diffusion among news media sites and blogs. Some works [2, 18] try to map the temporal information onto a continuous space and learn a diffusion kernel to explain the observed data. An-other approach [24] tries to utilize Poisson process to model the event cascade related to a single piece of content. [13] extends [24] X  X  model to describe the multiple event cascades by sharing the parameters.

The most related works to ours are [19, 24]. [24] also adopts Poisson process to construct the model, but it only considers social influence and does not utilize social connec-tions. [19] studies the effect of external influence and social influence. However it does not consider the user preference.
In this paper, we investigate the reasons why an event happens in social networks. We distinguish three factors as the event triggers to explain the formation of an event cascade. To integrate these factors, we propose a combina-tional model based on the mixed Poisson process to model the event cascade. Our model can not only explain how information diffuses, but also obtain the concrete reasons why a specific event happens. Furthermore, we develop an efficient Classification EM algorithm to infer the model pa-rameters. Extensive experiments and analysis on large data sets demonstrate that our model can (1) provide sound ex-planation to the observed event cascade and reveal the sub-tle structure of the diffusion process, and (2) make accurate prediction of the future event cascade.
