 fi ve textural feature families are extracted from IVUS images and computed at 1. Introduction
The burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is growing globally and coronary artery disease is considered as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in the western world ( Yusuf et al., 2001 ). Acute clinical manifestations are responsible for increased mortality and often constitute the end-result of a long and slow subclinical course of disease which has not caused any symptoms during the previous years. The plaque components of coronary arteries comprising fi brous tissue, calci fi cation, necrotic core and lipid can be distinguished as stable and unstable (vulnerable) plaques ( Murashige where plaque stability depends on its composition. Pathological studies indicate that plaques of the fi rst category, also referred to as  X  hard plaques  X  , consist of collagen fi bers to the largest extent of their volume, with smaller portions of lipid and thick fi brous cap. Unstable plaques or  X  soft plaques  X  on the other hand are characterized by lipid-rich necrotic cores covered by a thin fi brous cap. Compositions of this type are considered as vulnerable plaques that are prone to rupture.
The disruption of the thin-cap atheromatic plaques is responsible for the great majority of acute ischemic syndromes, causing thrombi or intimal hyperplasia and sudden cardiac deaths ( Kleber et al., 1998 ).
Pathological studies also indicate that vulnerable plaques with less than 75% stenosis, neither limiting coronary fl ow nor producing angina, were associated to cardiovascular problems ( Yamagishi et al., 2000 ). Moreover, the plaque types respond differently to pharmaceu-tical and interventional therapies ( Vince et al., 2000 ). Hard plaques are effectively handled by clinical interventions, whereas vulnerable tissues are likely to regress by lipid removal through diet and drug therapy. Therefore, the accurate detection and quanti fi cation in vivo of plaque components is a crucial task in the evaluation of coronary arteries. Identi fi cation of vulnerable plaques at the early stages of progression allows, preemptively, the design of the proper therapy strategy to avert possible acute coronary syndromes.

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a diagnostic imaging mod-ality providing a tomographic visualization of coronary arteries.
It yields high-resolution cross-sectional frames that allow a detailed analysis of the arteries morphology and their composi-tion. In IVUS, a catheter emits radially a number of ultrasound beams and receives their echoes to form a gray-scale image. The underlying principle is that the various plaque components exhibit dissimilar acoustic impedances and therefore, re fl ect the radio-frequency (RF) signals in a different pattern. The resulting IVUS images are then used by expert physicians to differentiate between the plaque components according to their echogenicity. Hard plaques composed of fi brous and calci fi c tissues produce inter-mediate to high intensities while soft plaques, mostly related to lipid core, appear with low intensities.

Despite its essential importance, in clinical practice the assess-ment of tissue composition is performed manually on individual
IVUS frames. However, evaluating plaques by relying solely on the visualization of IVUS gray-level values is a tedious task. There are several limitations emanating from the fact that there is not a unique association between tissue constituents and their gray-level appearance in cross-sectional IVUS images. In particular, while fi brous tissues generally have intermediate echogenicity, dense fi brous plaques appear as calci fi ed lesions ( Gonzalo et al., 2008; Mintz et al., 2001 ). Furthermore, while traditionally lateral acoustic shadowing provides an indication for the existence of calci fi ed plaque, necrotic core can also cause shadowing ( Bruining et al., 2007 ). Numerous recent studies also demonstrate that owing to similar intensity level and texture appearance, there are severe dif fi culties in discriminating between fi brous and fatty tissues ( Hiro et al., 1997; Peters et al., 1994; Jeremias et al., 1999 ). Finally, manual evaluation is time-consuming, and primar-ily, subject to inter-observer and intra-observer variability.
To overcome these problems, a few automatic tissue character-ization techniques have been developed, among which virtual histology (VH) ( Nair et al., 2001, 2002 ) is the most popular and clinically available technique for in vivo plaque component analy-sis. IVUS-VH differentiates four plaque components, namely, calci fi cation (CA), fi brous (F), fi bro-lipid (FL) and calci cores (NC), exploiting the spectral content of the backscattered ultrasound RF signals obtained by the catheter. However, an important limitation of VH is the reduced longitudinal resolution arising from its electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated acquisition. Indeed, only one frame per second is acquired and characterized by VH, while IVUS images are produced at rate of 30 frames/s ( Taki et al., 2010 ). An additional shortcoming is its imprecise de fi nition of plaque borders, producing signi fi cant errors in the delineation of plaque areas ( Frutkin et al., 2007 ).

In the specialized IVUS-VH literature, Taki et al. (2010) pro-posed a hybrid image-based histology (IBH) methodology, in order to enhance the longitudinal resolution of IVUS-VH. The method categorizes plaque components into three classes: calcium, necro-tic core and fi bro-fatty, which is considered as an integrated class obtained by subsuming the fi brous and the fi bro-lipid classes. IBH extracts two types of textural features from IVUS images  X  are treated separately  X  and the tissue characterization is per-formed by means of an SVM ( Cortes and Vapnik 1995 ) classi
The approach also includes a post-processing stage, which incor-porates information extracted from gray-level histograms of the classes in order to correct the labeling of some pixels. In a recent proposal ( Taki et al., 2013 ), the methodology has been extended by considering a third family of textural features, thereby slightly increasing the classi fi cation accuracy. The main limitations of IBH are the relatively low accuracy obtained for the NC class, as well as its inability to discriminate between the FL and F classes. However, the characterization of NC and FL is important, since lipid is a prominent constituent of thin fi brous cap atheroma, and hence, it is essential for the detection of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques ( Murashige et al., 2005; Virmani et al., 2000 ).

The current proposal targets at alleviating the several limitations of previous methods. In particular, we adhere to the class setup provided by VH (CA, NC, F and FL), despite the strong correlation observed between F and FL. In order to increase the discrimination between the classes, a set of fi ve textural feature families is extracted fromtheoriginalIVUSframesatdifferentscales,resultinginan enriched space of 175 features. For the purpose of tissue character-ization, we propose the use of an ef fi cient genetic fuzzy rule-based classi fi cation (GFRBCS), being characterized by its embedded feature selection capabilities. The employed classi fi er produces compact and computationally ef fi cient rule bases, automatically identifying a small subset of informative features for each rule. The extensive experi-mental analysis proves the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to previous methodologies based on IVUS-VH, as well as other interpretable classi fi ers of the literature.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a thorough literature review of the various IVUS-related meth-odologies and highlights the contributions of our approach. Section 3 details the proposed methodology, describing the IVUS image acquisition, the dataset formulation along with the textural features extracted, as well as the shadow detection post-processing step. A brief description of the classi fi cation model and its learning algorithm is provided in Section 4 , along with an illustrative example of its classi fi cation model. Extensive experi-mental results are reported in Section 5 and the paper concludes in Section 6 , with a summary of the proposed methodology. 2. Literature review and contribution of our approach
The process of analyzing IVUS images involves sequentially two distinct stages, namely, determin ation of the vessel borders, also referred to as IVUS segmentation, and characterization of the plaque components. The latter stage is further divided into two steps: extraction of discriminating feat ures to describe the tissue types and selection of a classi fi cation model along with a learning algo-rithm to build and train the classi fi er. 2.1. IVUS segmentation
IVUS segmentation is a prerequisite for the plaque assessment stage and consists of detecting the lumen-intima and the media-adventitia borders of the vessel wall. The vessel volume accumulated between these borders delineates the atherosclerotic plaque area to be analyzed (see Fig. 1 (a)). Several segmentation techniques are suggested in the literature for border detection. Sonka et al. (1995) implemented a semi-automated knowledge-based approach that includes graph searching, incorporation of apriori knowledge on artery morphology and pre-selection of the region of interest prior to automatic border detection. Conto urs detection though fails for low contrast interface regions, such as the luminal border where the blood-wall interface in most images exhibits weak pixel intensity variations. In order to overcome th ese limitations, automated meth-ods are de fi nitely more attractive ( Taki et al., 2008; Unal et al., 2008; Papadogiorgaki et al., 2006; Gil et al., 2000, 2006; Pujol et al., 2003a ). Border detection is accomplished in ( Taki et al., 2008 )usingpara-metric or deformable models while shape-driven models are used in ( Unal et al., 2008 ). The fully-automated technique presented in ( Papadogiorgaki et al., 2006 ) is based on textural analysis by means of a multilevel Discrete Wavelet Frames decomposition. The method detects accurately the lumen-inti ma and media-adventitial bound-aries without requiring manual initialization of the contours. Borders detection is achieved in ( Gil et al., 2000, 2006 ) using a probabi-listic fl exible template or statistical point selection combined with thresholding and anisotropic fi ltering. Finally, the authors in ( Pujol et al., 2003a )resorttotexturalanalysisandtheusageofdeformable models to ensure continuity in the segmentation. 2.2. Plaque characterization
The variety of plaque characterization techniques suggested in the literature can be categorized according to two distinguishing factors: the approach used for tissue labeling and the information space employed for feature extraction. The labeling of the selected regions of interest (ROIs) is a critical issue, having a signi impact on the classi fi er's learning and the validation of the method. In some methods, this task is performed by expert clinicians from visualization of IVUS images ( Zhang et al., 1998;
Pujol et al., 2003b; Caballero et al., 2007 ). This approach suffers from the limitations of manual evaluation and especially the high inter/intra-observer variability. Therefore, in the greatest majority of the methods, more reliable ground truth labels are attained via histological analysis of post-mortem arteries (in vitro data) ( Nair et al., 2001, 2002; Nasu et al., 2006; Kawasaki et al., 2002 ).
With regard to the information space criterion, the tissue characterization methods are divided into three classes: image-based approaches ( Zhang et al., 1998; Pujol et al., 2003b; Caballero et al., 2007; Brunenberg et al., 2006; Taki et al., 2010 ), RF signal analysis ( Nair et al., 2001, 2002; Nasu et al., 2006; Kawasaki et al., 2002; Okubo et al., 2008; Katouzian et al., 2008; de Korte et al., 2002 ), and combined feature spaces ( Caballero et al., 2006;
Escalera et al., 2009; Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995; Ciompi et al., 2010 ). The advantage of the image-based methods lies on the availability of the images as a standard data source from commer-cial equipment and the wealth of existing textural descriptors to capture the spatial information of gray-level pixels. The ef textural analysis for in vivo plaque assessment is demonstrated in ( Zhang et al., 1998; Pujol et al., 2003b; Caballero et al., 2007;
Brunenberg et al., 2006; Taki et al., 2010 ), whereby a variety of different texture features are investigated, including among others, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) ( Haralick et al., 1973 ), local binary patterns (LBP) ( Ojala et al., 2002 ), Gabor and features extracted from run-length (RL) matrix ( Galloway, 1975 ). Textural features in ( Caballero et al., 2007 ) are computed on reconstructed IVUS images obtained from raw RF data through an integrated multi-step procedure. These images have the advantage that all frames are normalized and their contrast is radially adjusted with a common parameter set.
 backscattered ultrasound RF signals obtained by the catheter. A signi fi cant paradigm of this category is the so-called virtual histology (VH) ( Nair et al., 2001, 2002 ) that has gained consider-able attention recently and is clinically available for in vivo plaque assessment. The method differentiates four plaque components: calci fi cation (CA), fi brous (F), fi bro-lipid (FL) and calci cores (NC) and overlays a color coded map ( Fig. 1 b). The feature set in IVUS-VH comprises eight spectral parameters which are derived from spectral shape approximations by auto-regressive (AR) mod-els. Tissue labeling is performed by histology data, while the classi fi cation is carried out using classi fi cation trees. Recent studies show that the in vivo IVUS-VH characterizations are highly correlated with in vitro histopathology ( Nasu et al., 2006 ). How-ever, an important limitation of VH is the reduced longitudinal resolution arising from its electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated acquisi-tion. In particular, owing to the RF attenuation and the presence of blood in arteries, only one frame/s is acquired and analyzed by VH in a cardiac cycle (synchronized with the R-wave), while IVUS images are produced at a rate of 30 frames/s ( Taki et al., 2010 ).
This causes a considerable loss of information and raises the issue of plaque assessment at the intermediate frames. The integrated backscatter IVUS (IB-IVUS) is another method based on RF analysis that discriminates atherosclerotic plaques into fi ve classes: throm-bus, intimal hyperplasia, fi brous, mixed lesions and calci according to the IB values of the RF signal ( Kawasaki et al., 2002;
Okubo et al., 2008 ). Katouzian et al. (2008) discuss the dif due to bandwidth variations of the transducers, show the linear dependence of certain spectral parameters and suggest the extrac-tion of FFT features from the functional range of transducer's bandwidth.
 the image texture and RF spectrum. In ( Caballero et al., 2006;
Escalera et al., 2009 ), a set of 170 features is computed overall, which is composed of 68 textural features (GLCM, LBP, Gabor) extracted from reconstructed IVUS images along with 102 spectral and slope features obtained through RF analysis. For classi purposes, the authors resort to the error-correcting output codes (ECOC) ( Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995 ) and develop a strategy to split tissue classes into sub-class groups. The approach achieves high accuracies with different classi fi ers when discriminating between calcium, fi brous and soft plaques. In a recently appeared promi-nent work Ciompi et al. (2010) employ a combined feature space as in ( Escalera et al., 2009 ), whereas classi fi cation is accomplished by AdaBoost ( Freund and Schapire, 1996 ) learning under the ECOC framework. The authors design a sequential fl oating forward selection methodology, whereby in vivo and in vitro data are fused in order to enhance the in vitro training data.

Concluding with the literature review, a hybrid image-based histology (IBH) is proposed by Taki et al. (2010) to enhance the longitudinal resolution of IVUS-VH. The method categorizes plaque components into three classes: calcium, necrotic core and whichisconsideredasanintegratedclass,obtainedbysubsumingthe fi brous and the fi bro-lipid classes. IBH extracts two types of textural features from IVUS images (LBP, RL) that are treated individually.
Tissue classi fi cation is performed by an SVM classi fi er, whereas the pattern labels are determined by characterized VH images. The approach also includes shadow detection and a post-processing stage.
This latter stage incorporates information extracted from gray-level histograms of the classes. Accordingly, the labels assigned by SVM are con fi rmed or altered depending on the pixel's intensity with respect to some threshold values, heuristically de fi nedforCAandNCclasses.
The reported results show that IBH attains a pixel-based overall accuracy of 75% with the RL featur es outperforming the LBP ones.
The method has been recently extended ( Taki et al., 2013 )withthe inclusion of a third textural feature family, namely, the neighboring gray-level (NGL) features. The best results were achieved when combining all features into a single vector, providing an increase in the accuracy by approximately 5% for each class, compared to the original IBH. For classi fi cation purposes, the authors compared the
SVM classi fi er and the ECOC framework, achieving similar results. 2.3. Contributions of our approach
Fuzzy rule-based classi fi cation systems (FRBCSs) have found con-siderable application in many and diverse application areas, since they have been proven ef fi cient in providing a good balance between model simplicity, interpretability, and classi fi cation accuracy. In parti-cular, linguistic (or descriptive) FRBCSs ( Ishibuchi et al., 2004 )havethe most intuitive representation, comprising a set of simple IF rules with linguistic terms from a common fuzzy sets database.
Through them, an analyst can gain deeper insight on the underlying physical principles governing the problem at hand. Over the past two decades, genetic algorithms (GAs) ( Holland, 1975 )(oranyother evolutionary algorithm (EA) ( Jong, 2006 ) in general) have been successfully employed in order to effectively determine the optimal structure of FRBCSs, giving rise to the fi eld of genetic FRBCSs (GFRBCSs) ( Cord X n et al., 2001 ). Local feature selection mechanisms can be easily incorporated in the design of GFRBCSs, facilitating the creation of compact yet high-performing rule bases even for high-dimensional feature spaces.

In this paper, we suggest an image-based method for the in vivo assessment of coronary atherosclerotic plaques from IVUS images. The distinctions and goals of our approach are described as follows: (1) Plaque labeling : We employ the available IVUS frames char-acterized by VH to determine the labels of plaque patterns used for the classi fi er's learning and validation. Consequently, as in IBH we retain the merit of enhanced longitudinal resolution, since our method is able to evaluate all intermedi-ate IVUS frames not analyzed by VH. This asset allows a more detailed track of the plaque component variations longitudin-ally and assists physicians to draw safer conclusions about possible vessel lesions ( Taki et al., 2010 ). (2) Class con fi guration : The fi bro-lipid class is mostly related to high lipid cores, also comprising loosely packed collagen fi bers, without cholesterol clefts and necrosis areas ( Vince et al., 2000 ). Therefore, we adhere to the class setup provided by
VH ( Nair et al., 2002 ) and proceed to discriminating the plaque (3) Feature space : A rich set of fi ve textural feature families are (4) Local Feature selection: A side-effect of considering jointly all (5) Linguistic classi fi er : In our method we suggest the application 3. Proposed plaque characterization methodology
The architecture of the suggested IVUS image based algorithm is depicted in Fig. 2 . In the following subsections we describe the different stages involved in the methodology, apart from the FaIRLiC classi fi cation step, which is described separately in Section 4 . 3.1. Image data acquisition
The pool of IVUS images acquired in our experimental setup is taken from seven patients with known coronary artery disease. The IVUS imaging catheter used is the Eagle Eye Gold (Volcano
Inc., Rancho Cordova, CA, USA) with the following main character-istics: frequency 20 MHz, scanner diameter 3.5F, compatible with 0.014-inch guidewire and fi eld of view 16 mm. With the help of an s5i-system (Volcano Inc., Rancho Cordova, CA, USA), gray-scale
IVUS frames were acquired during automatic pullback at a speed of 0.5 mm/s using a dedicated pullback device (Track Back II). From the pullbacks pertaining to each patient, 5  X  8 vessel sections were selected for further analysis. A total number of 300 (500 500) gray-scale IVUS and their corresponding ECG-gaited VH images were subsequently attained, exhibiting different proportions of the plaque components. The available VH frames have been character-ized using equipment image analysis software (Volcano Inc.).
Before proceeding to the analysis of tissue composition we need to determine the inner and outer walls of coronary arteries.
Apart from the ECG-gaited acquisition demerit, an additional shortcoming of the VH methodology is its imprecise de fi nition of plaque borders which causes errors in the delineation of plaque areas to be processed ( Frutkin et al., 2007 ). In order to confront this limitation, the plaque segmentation is accomplished using the approach suggested in ( Papadogiorgaki et al., 2006 ). The method automatically determines the lumen-intima and media-adventitia borders without the need for manual interventions, although post-corrections of the contours are occasionally necessary.
From the plaque areas in the acquired cross-sectional frames we have collected an overall of 700 regions of interest (ROI) of varying size, each one comprising plaque components of the different classes considered in this work: calcium (CA), necrotic core (NC), fi brous (F), and fi bro-lipid (FL). The collection of ROIs on
IVUS gray-scale images is decided with the aid of expert physicians in combination with the VH characterizations. Each pixel in the gray-level IVUS image is assigned to one of the four classes above, as dictated by the associated reference VH color maps (data labeling).

The generated dataset contains approximately 2 million labeled pixels. Apparently, the total number of patterns is extremely high for learning purposes of almost any supervised classi fi cation system. In order to avoid the exhaustive learning computational requirements using this excessive amount of data, there is the need for reducing the dataset dimensionality. To achieve this goal, we used a 2-D Kohonen's self-organizing feature map (SOFM) ( Kohonen, 1982 ), to select a subset of 6000 prototypical pixels from ROIs. In particular, the reduced dataset comprises 900 calcium (15%), 1500 necrotic core (25%), 2400 fi brous (40%), and 1200 fi bro-lipid (20%) labeled patterns. In deriving this dataset, we tried to approximately maintain the class proportions of the original dataset. However, the fi bro-lipid class comprises relatively fewer instances, compared to those belonging to the fi brous class (approximately 50% of the original dataset patterns are labeled as fi brous and 10% as fi bro-fatty). Since those two classes exhibit a high degree of overlapping in the feature space and gray-level histograms, their proportions were slightly adjusted in the reduced dataset, in order to avoid any possible underestimation of the minor class. The original proportions of the other two classes were approximately maintained in the reduced dataset. 3.2. Feature extraction pixels' intensity) is not a reliable approach in order to discriminate the highly mixed tissue types involved in IVUS images. The incorporation of spatial features is a constructive method to address this challenge. Extensive studies in plaque component analysis from IVUS images demonstrate that combining spatial with spectral information can considerably improve the classi tion results ( Zhang et al., 1998; Pujol et al., 2003b; Caballero et al., 2007; Brunenberg et al., 2006; Taki et al., 2010 ). A great variety of feature extraction methods are suggested in the literature, empha-sizing on different properties of the texture such as statistics, scale and structure. In this paper, we consider fi ve types of textural features: fi rst-order (FO) statistics, the well-known gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), wavelets features (WF) from multi-resolution analysis of images, run-length (RL) and local binary patterns (LBP) features describing structural properties. window de fi ning the spatial neighborhood around pixels. The window size being selected, i.e., the level of scale analysis, has a signi fi cant impact on the accuracy of the obtained classi results. Previous research shows that the window size should be properly selected according to the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the local area. Small windows can preserve detailed structures and avoid the in fl uence of texture features from adjacent different tissue types, but contain limited data to make solid assumptions.
On the other hand, large windows may contain misleading information, especially for border pixels, thus creating an over-lapping between spectrally neighboring classes. This fi nding is veri fi ed when dealing with image analysis, as well as in other scienti fi c areas, such as land cover classi fi cation of remotely sensed images. Particularly, in this latter domain, the images from satellite bands are mainly analyzed in respect to their textural content; the textural differences of the various classes are used to distinguish the different cover types appearing in the terrain ( Ouma et al., 2006 ). Exploiting the above evidence, we resort here to multi-scale feature extraction, in order to capture effectively the varying heterogeneity of plaque components. More speci fi cally, each feature is computed from IVUS images using concentric windows of six different sizes: 5 5, 7 7, 9 9, 11 11, 13 13 and 15 15. size combinations, we fi nally obtain a set of 175 features (24 FO, 24
GLCM, 42 WF, 66 RL, 18 LBP, and the original image intensity). In contrast to the approach followed by other methods, the inte-grated feature space formulated in this way takes into considera-tion the discrimination abilities of all features families at multiple scales of analysis. The experimental investigation presented in
Section 5 reveals that our classi fi er selects different features with the appropriate window sizes for the differentiation of each tissue class against the others. Hence, both the structural properties of the features and their scale of extraction are important factors for plaque composition assessment. The rest of this section describes each feature family considered. 3.2.1. First and higher order Statistics
First and higher order (FHO) statistics is a traditional family of textural features. Despite their simplicity, they have been proven quite informative as indicators of spatial association, striving to detect local patterns in a block image. In this context, we extract four FHO features: mean (  X  ), variance (  X  2 ), skew and kurtosis. Table 1 provides the analytical description of these features, where I ( i , j ) denotes a pixel within an image window of size W W and
N is the total number of pixels in the window. 3.2.2. Gray-level co-occurrence matrices
Second order features from Greay Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) ( Haralick et al., 1973 ) have been extensively used for statistical analysis of textural images. GLCM indicates how often different gray levels ( i , j ) occur along a speci fi c direction distance d between the pixel centers. Assuming G gray levels within the image, a G G matrix is computed where the ( i , j ) element de fi ned as: p  X  i ; where i and j refer to matrix rows and columns, f d ;  X  ij frequency of occurrence of gray levels ( i , j ) separated by a distance d and a direction  X  , and N stands for the total number of pixels in the window for a particular value of d . Among the different features that can be extracted from GLCM, we consider the four most widely used measures: energy (or angular second moment,
ASM), contrast (or inertia), homogeneity, and shade, the de tions of which are shown in Table 2 . 3.2.3. Wavelets
The fast wavelet transform (FWT) ( Mallat 1989 ) is based on multi-resolution analysis (MRA) of images. Using a two-channel fi lter bank algorithm, we perform a two-level wavelet decomposi-tion of the original image. At the fi rst level, four subimages are formed containing the approximation (LL 1 ), horizontal detail (LH ), vertical detail (HL 1 ), and diagonal detail coef fi cients (HH respectively. The approximation subimage of the fi rst level is further decomposed into four subimages at the second level.
For each one of the resulting seven subimages {LL 2 ,LH 2 HH 2 ,LH 1 ,HL 1 ,HH 1 }, we compute the total energy measure from the associated wavelet coef fi cients. Energy distribution from FWT provides detailed description of the frequency content of an image. We used the bi-orthogonal wavelet basis function for the image decomposition. 3.2.4. Run-length features
Run-length (RL) features ( Galloway, 1975 ) are effective descrip-tors of textural images. Therefore, they have been previously employed for plaque analysis ( Taki et al., 2010 ). These features operate upon the relation between gray-level values appearing in pixel sequences. The derivation of RLs relies on the observation that in a coarse texture, relatively long gray-level runs occur more often, i.e., there are adequate pixel neighbors with similar gray-level tones. On the contrary, fi ne textures exhibit primarily short runs, due to frequent gray-level variations. Texture information is described by the gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM) [ p ( i , j )] where M is the number of gray levels and N denotes the maximum run length. For a given image, the entry p ( i , j )isde fi number of runs of length j with pixels of gray level i .
Based on the GLRLM, a variety of traditional texture features can be extracted, emphasizing on different regions of the gray-level and/or run length domains. The fi ve original run length features suggested in ( Galloway, 1975 ) are: short run emphasis (SRE), long run emphasis (LRE), gray-level non-uniformity (GLN), run length non-uniformity (RLN) and run percentage (RP). SRE (LRE) emphasize on the short (long) runs, providing high values for fi ne (coarse) textures. For equally distributed runs along the gray levels GLN has a minimum value, whereas for high run lengths it takes a maximum. Moreover, for equally distributed run lengths throughout the image, RLN receives a low value, but for high run counts it becomes maximal. Chu et al. (1990) proposed two new features, namely, the low gray-level run emphasis (LGRE) and high gray-level run emphasis (HGRE), emphasizing on the run length axis. Finally, four more extraction functions are suggested in ( Tang, 1997 ), considered as joint statistical measures of gray level and run length: short run low gray-level emphasis (SRLGE), short run high gray-level emphasis (SRHGE), long run low gray-level emphasis (LRLGE), and long run high gray-level emphasis (LRHGE). The analytical description of all the aforementioned features is given in Table 3 , where n  X   X  M i  X  1  X  N j  X  1 p  X  i ; j  X  represents the total number of runs and n is the number of pixels in the image. 3.2.5. Local binary patterns
Local Binary Patterns (LBP) is a structural measure in which the intensity of the central pixel is compared with the intensities of P neighboring pixels allocated in a circularly symmetric neighbor-hood ( Ojala et al., 2002 ). Let g c be the gray-value of the central pixel and g p denote the gray-value of the p th neighboring pixel. The following equation forms a binary vector of P digits: s  X  g
Owing to the circular symmetry of the neighborhood around the central pixel being processed, LBP features are rotationally invariant.
In our experiments, we calculate the three following LBP textural features, denoted as RI (Rotation-Invariant), URI (Uniform Rotation-Invariant), and VAR (Local Variance), respectively: RI
VAR P ; R  X  var f g p g ;  X  5  X  where U ( RI P , R ) is the number of transitions from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0inthebinaryvector. 3.3. Shadow detection
IVUS gray-scale images sometimes appear with acoustic sha-dow behind hard plaque structures, such as calcium or very dense fi brous. These shadow regions are characterized by low intensity values and poor texture and in this context they provide very restricted information for plaque analysis. Because of this, the characterization of shadow areas by IVUS-VH may differ from histology based interpretations provided by pathologists ( Taki et al., 2010; Konig et al., 2008 ). In order to avoid erroneous assign-ments, the shadow regions are considered as a speci fi c plaque class. Detection of these areas is performed for each IVUS frame via a post-processing stage that operates on the initial classi tion map obtained by FaIRLiC (described in the following), using the algorithm proposed in ( Giannoglou and Theocharis, 2014 ). The detected shadow areas are not taken into account in the validation of plaque assessment methods, i.e., these pixels are not considered for the computation of classi fi cation accuracies. Reclassi due to lateral shadowing involves the very low part of the intensity range and affects mostly fi bro-lipidic components and secondarily the fi brous or necrotic cores. 4. The classi fi cation system
The classi fi cation task of our methodology is accomplished using the previously suggested FaIRLiC classi fi er ( Stavrakoudis et al., 2012a ). Among the various methodologies proposed for creat-ing GFRBCSs ( Herrera, 2008 ), FaIRLiC follows the principles of the so-called Iterative Rule Learning (IRL) approach ( Cord X n et al., 2001; Gonz X lez and P X rez, 1999, 2001; Cord X n et al., 1999 ). Under the IRL, the fi nal rule base is constructed iteratively, through repeated invocations to a rule extraction algorithm (REA), each time creating a single fuzzy rule. FaIRLiC has been selected as the classi fi cation scheme of the present study because of its ability to produce high-performing and compact rule bases, with low computational requirements, even for very highly-dimensional classi fi cation tasks. The interpretability of FRBCSs is often con-sidered to be their main virtue and it is a topic gaining an increasing degree of attention from the respective scienti munity in recent years ( Alonso and Magdalena, 2011a, 2011b;
Cord X n, 2011 ). From FaIRLiC's point of view, interpretability is closely related to the structural simplicity of the derived classi tion model and, in particular, the ability of its learning algorithm to optimally identify the minimum number of useful features in a per rule basis. Although the issue of interpretability has been recently explored from many and diverse points of view ( Gacto et al., 2011;
Hole  X  a 2009; Mencar et al., 2011; Alonso et al., 2009 ), the structural simplicity of the derived model undoubtedly constitutes an important prerequisite for the easy interpretation of the problem at hand, and particularly the tissue characterization task elaborated here. The rest of this section shortly describes FaIRLiC, primarily focusing on the obtained classi fi cation model. For reasons of completeness, we also provide a brief description of its learning algorithm; an in-depth analysis can be found in ( Stavrakoudis et al., 2012a ). 4.1. FaIRLiC ' s classi fi cation model and a set of M classes C  X  C 1 ; ... ; C M fg , a FaIRLiC model comprises a set of fuzzy classi fi cation rules of the following form:
R k : If x 1 is A k 1 and  X  and x N is A k N Then y is C k where A k i  X  i  X  1 ; ... ; N  X  are fuzzy sets de fi ned along the i th input variable (feature) and r k is the certainty degree of the classi in the class C k A C , for a pattern belonging to the fuzzy subspace de fi ned in the antecedent part of the rule.
 of  X  possible values, represented by uniformly distributed trian-gular fuzzy sets with a linguistic meaning, resulting in a descrip-tive (or linguistic) ( Cord X n et al., 2001 ) FRBCS. An example of such a partition with  X   X  7 linguistic terms is depicted in Fig. 3 , assuming the i th input variable. The same partition is employed for all the input variables, forming the fuzzy sets database (FSDB) of the FRBCS. All rules of the fuzzy rule base are formed by selecting the appropriate terms from this common FSDB. More-over, we employ fuzzy rules of the so-called disjunctive normal form (DNF), where each variable is allowed to take as value multiple linguistic labels from its associated term set, joined by the OR disjunctive operator, instead of only one (for example, such composite fuzzy sets are only formed be consecutive linguis-tic terms, that is, the creation of a fuzzy clause such as  X  x i is L 1 i OR L 5 i  X  is not possible. Additionally, some input variables in each rule are allowed to be absent, which, in fuzzy terms, has the meaning of a  X  don't care  X  fuzzy set (a fuzzy set with a unity membership grade for its entire universe of discourse). For the sake of simplicity, in the rest of the paper we will refer to an input variable (feature) x i as active when the fuzzy clause  X  x present in the rule and as inactive in the opposite case.
Given a feature vector x p to be classi fi ed, the matching degree of the k th rule is derived through x where  X  L q i i  X  x p i  X  is the membership grade of each linguistic term participating in the formulation of i th variable's fuzzy value, and \ and [ denote the AND and OR operators, respectively. The
AND operator is implemented conventionally through the mini-mum operator and the OR operator is implemented through the bounded sum, de fi ned for two membership values a and b as bounded _ sum  X  a ; b  X  X  min  X  1 ; a  X  b  X  :  X  8  X 
Hence, the composite fuzzy set is mathematically equivalent to a trapezoidal fuzzy set, having a far more reasonable interpreta-tion than the one provided by the usually selected maximum operator, which results in taking the envelop of neighboring membership functions.
 The fuzzy reasoning method is implemented here through
C  X  arg max using the so-called maximum voting scheme ( Ishibuchi et al., 1999 ). A thorough discussion of various voting schemes can be found in ( Ishibuchi et al., 1999 ), whereas other fuzzy reasoning methods can be found in ( Ishibuchi et al., 2004; Cord X n et al., 1998; Barrenechea et al., 2013; Sanz et al., 2013 ).

Learning algorithm An outline of FaIRLiC's learning algorithm is given in Fig. 4 .
Following the IRL methodology, the fi nal fuzzy rule base is constructed through repeated invocations to the rule extraction algorithm (REA), each time creating a single DNF rule in the form of (6) . The main advantage of the IRL approach is that the original problem is decomposed into simpler subtasks, thus facilitating the derivation of FRBCSs for complex classi fi cation tasks with reduced computational requirements. In order however for new rules to target uncovered or mixed regions of the feature space, a mechan-ism that will penalize previously covered training examples is required. Such a framework is provided in FaIRLiC through a weighting scheme, inspired from the AdaBoost algorithm ( Freund and Schapire, 1996 ). In effect, all training patterns are assigned a weight, initialized with a unity value. Each time a new rule is inserted in the rule base, the weights the correctly classi patterns are reduced, according to the rule's error and each pattern's matching degree (7) . Hence, subsequent invocations to the REA implicitly direct new rules to be created in uncovered or mixed areas of the feature space. However, since the patterns are down-weighted but never removed by the training set, new rules describing different class labels are still aware of the borders between neighboring classes, a fact that implicitly promotes the cooperation between the rules. This sort of boosted IRL methodol-ogy has been successfully employed in a number of contributions ( Hoffmann, 2004; del Jesus et al., 2004; Stavrakoudis et al., 2012b ). As shown in Fig. 4 , we learn one class label at a time, with no particular order being assumed. When no more useful rules can be produced for the class under consideration, the algorithm pro-ceeds to the next class label. The termination conditions rely on the performance of the new rule on a separate validation set of examples. Accordingly, FaIRLiC's learning algorithm requires the initial set of labeled patterns to be split into two disjoint sets: the training and the validation ones.

FaIRLiC's rule extraction algorithm is performed in four succes-sive steps, as depicted in Fig. 4 . Speci fi cally (a) The fi rst step initializes the algorithm by selecting the most (b) Given these terms, the second step employs a binary GA in (c) After having selected the relevant features of the rule, another (d) The fi nal step is a simple deterministic one, which corrects the After producing the initial rule base through the IRL procedure,
FaIRLiC's learning algorithm employs two post-processing steps, namely, feature reduction and genetic tuning. Feature reduction is a simple deterministic step, which tries to minimize the number of each rule's active features, without decreasing the classi racy. The genetic tuning stage targets at increasing the classi performance of the system, by fi ne-tuning the fuzzy sets de in the common FSDB. It is performed with another type of evolu-tionary algorithm, called Evolution Strategies (ES) ( B X ck,1996 ), which is well-suited for real-valued parameter optimization problems.
In order to maintain the interpretability of the linguistic fuzzy rule base, we preserve the strong fuzzy p artition of each input variable.
Therefore, only the modal points of the inner fuzzy sets are adjus-ted. A detailed description of the tuning stage can be found in ( Stavrakoudis et al., 2012b ). 4.3. FaIRLiC example
Before presenting the comparative analysis of the proposed scheme, we provide here an example of a fuzzy rule base produced by FaIRLiC for the IVUS classi fi cation problem. A visual representa-tion of the derived rule base is depicted in Fig. 5 . In this each row of subplots represents a single fuzzy rule (depicted in order of creation), whereas the fi rst row provides the class histograms of each features. The feature names are presented in an abbreviated form, following the format: { textural feature family : feature name ( window size )}. For each rule, the fuzzy partition of each active variable is shown (after tuning) and the selected linguistic terms in each case are represented by fi lled triangles.
The last column of subplots represents the consequent of the fuzzy rule, with both the class label and the respective certainty degree (10) being provided. For visualization purposes, the whole rule base has been split into three parts. The numbers inside curly braces on the far right represent the crisp coverage of each rule, being de fi ned as the number of training patterns for which the rule exhibits a non-zero matching degree (7) to the total number of patterns of the respective class. We should also note that the linguistic terms forming the antecedent part of the DNF fuzzy rules are represented here as fi lled triangles, in order to assist the visual presentation of the classi fi er. Nevertheless, the application of the bounded sum operator (8) actually results in the composite fuzzy set being mathematically equivalent to the circumscribed trapezoidal fuzzy set.
 space, we can assert that FaIRLiC produces a very compact rule base, with a low number of features per rule and relatively few rules. In particular, more general rules (covering a high number of positive examples) are created for each class fi rst, whereas sub-sequent rules (which typically select a higher number of features) are localized in more specialized areas of the feature space. In point of fact, if we only consider the most general rule for each class, as determined by the rules' crisp coverage degrees, we can describe the basic properties governing the plaque component assessment task through the far more compact rule base view shown in Fig. 6 . These four rules can be regarded as a coarse description of the problem, whereas the other four rules provide the detailed relations required for increasing the accuracy of the classi fi er. Note that each one of the four most general rules only considers a FO mean feature with a different window size, apart from the NC and FL classes, which both consider the FO:mean (11) fi rst order textural feature. This proves our initial assertion that the window size of textural features should be evaluated in a per R05 {0.97} R06 {0.05} R07 {0.95} R08 {0.01} class basis, since the various tissue types are best discriminated at different scales, an issue that is further elaborated in Section 5.4 .
Sample tissue characterizations (obtained by the FaIRLiC model presented above) are given in Fig. 7 , for three random IVUS images of the testing dataset. In this fi gure, the classi fi cation results obtained by both the full rule base and the reduced one of Fig. 6 are shown. FaIRLiC clearly identi fi ed all the tissue structures ( Fig. 7 c), even producing smoother classi fi cation boundaries than the IVUS-VH reference ( Fig. 7 b). This effect should be attributed to the evaluation of textural features, which are calculated consider-ing a window around each pixel. From the physician's point of view, this behavior is rather desirable, since the various plaque components can be identi fi ed more easily. Moreover, the char-acterizations derived from the compact rule base of Fig. 6 are very similar to those produced by the full rule base. Speci fi calcium class in the former case was slightly underestimated compared to the characterization provided by the whole rule base. Nevertheless, the overall result of the reduced rule base is surprisingly accurate, a fact that can also be concluded by the classi fi cation accuracies achieved in each case, which are reported in Fig. 7 . We should note that the ROI parts where no IVUS-VH target exists have been maintained unlabeled in the characteriza-tions of Fig. 7 . As described in the introductory section, the poor vessel border detection of the IVUS-VH methodology constitutes one of its limitations, as it is visually apparent. In addition, the frame presented of Fig. 7 was one of the frames of the testing dataset with a shadow component. 5. Experimental results 5.1. Experimental setup
As described in Section 3.1 ,wehaveextractedasetof6000 prototypical labeled patterns out of the approximately 2 million available VH-characterized pixels. This set forms our training set ,used for learning the various classi fi ersconsideredinthisstudy.Particularly for FaIRLiC, this set was further split into two equal parts, resulting in the fi nal training and validation partitions, as required by its learning algorithm. For testing purposes, we considered 40 additional IVUS images along with their corresponding VH targets which are not involved in the learning stage of classi fi ers. This dataset comprises in total 388,519 labeled patterns and constitutes our testing set .We
R01 {0.81} R04 {0.99} 2: 0.63 R05 {0.97} 3: 0.69
R07 {0.95} 4: 0.60 should note that from the clinical point of view, the ultimate goal is to classify all available IVUS frames and not only those that are accompanied by an equivalent VH characterization. Here, however, we only considered frames that have a corresponding VH reference image, since we need to calculate the classi fi cation accuracies obtained by the various classi fi ers. Out of the total number of testing patterns, 12.99% are labeled as calcium, 24.13% as necrotic core, 52.29% as fi brous and 10.59% as fi bro-lipid.

FaIRLiC was compared to a number of well-known classi fi ers of the literature. In this paper, we mostly considered classi algorithms resulting in some form of interpretable classi models, both fuzzy and non-fuzzy. Speci fi cally, we considered two other GFRBCSs, the 2SLAVE-2 ( Gonz X lez and P X rez, 2001 ) and the
SGERD ( Mansoori et al., 2008 ) classi fi ers, three crisp (non-fuzzy) rule-based classi fi ers, namely, the C4.5 Rules ( Quinlan 1993 ), the
Ripper ( Cohen, 1995 ) and the Slipper ( Cohen and Singer, 1999 ) algorithms. Moreover, we considered a non-genetic FRBCS, the Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm (FURIA) ( H X hn and
H X llermeier, 2009 ). FURIA is an extension of the Ripper rule induction algorithm, created through a fuzzi fi cation process of the initial crisp rule base model. Additionally, the C4.5 ( Quinlan, 1993 ) algorithm was also included in the experimental setup. The latter produces a crisp decision tree classi fi cation model which is also interpretable, although it doesn't comprise a set of simple classi fi cation rules as all the other classi fi ers considered. The aforementioned classi fi ers were evaluated using the KEEL software package ( Alcala-Fdez et al., 2009, 2011 ). In applying FaIRLiC, we partitioned each feature variable into  X   X  7 linguistic terms. This value provided the best results, as determined by a preliminary trial-and-error procedure. The rest of the algorithm's parameters are the same with those reported in ( Stavrakoudis et al., 2012a ).
The parameters for all other classi fi ers were set to their default values, as proposed by their respective authors. Particularly for 2SLAVE-2,  X   X  7 linguistic terms for each feature variable were also considered.

In addition to the aforementioned interpretable classi fi systems, we also considered a non-interpretable classi fi the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classi fi er ( Cortes and Vapnik, 1995 ), a popular choice for many applications in the data mining fi eld, including tissue characterization ( Taki et al., 2010, 2013 ). The
SVM was applied considering a radial basis kernel (RBF) and a one-versus-rest methodology. Moreover, each feature variable was normalized by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. These parameters were calculated on the reduced dataset and were subsequently used also to normalize the testing dataset. The parameters C and  X  of the classi fi er were determi-ned through a 5-fold cross-validation approach on the training set, considering the commonly applied grid of possible values C
A 2 5 ; 2 3 ; ... ; 2 15 values C  X  8 and  X   X  2 7 were selected.

The learning algorithm of all classi fi ers considered in this study apart from C4.5 and SVM exhibit stochastic characteristics. In order to derive reliable conclusions, 10 independent runs of each algorithm were conducted, each time using a different seed for the pseudo-random number generator. In the presentation of the experiments, average results over these 10 runs are reported.
Apparently, the C4.5 and SVM classi fi ers were employed only once, since their learning algorithm is deterministic. All experi-ments were conducted on an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650 at 3.0 GHz, with 8 GB of RAM.

The assessment of the obtained classi fi cation accuracies is performed through typical performance measures derived from the confusion matrix ( Congalton, 1991 ). In particular, we considered the overall and average (per class) classi fi cation accuracy, as well as two class-speci fi c measures, the producer's and user's accuracies.
The producer's accuracy is de fi ned  X  for each class  X  as the number of correctly classi fi ed patterns (true positives) to the total number of class patterns, thus representing the typical per class classi accuracy. It provides a measure for the occurred omission errors (false negative patterns), therefore evaluating the degree to which a classi fi er underestimates the particular class. The user's accuracy is de fi ned as the number of correctly classi fi ed patterns for a given class to the total number of patterns attributed to this class by the classi fi er. We should note that the majority of existing methods in tissue characterization are traditionally validated in terms of measures de fi ned by the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis ( Fawcett, 2006 ). ROC analysis uses a different nomenclature, whereby the producer's accuracy is termed sensitivity and the user's accuracy is referred to as precision.
 whole testing set (388,519 patterns), derived by concatenating the
VH targets of all 40 testing images into a single reference vector and averaged over the 10 independent runs (that is, for the algorithms with stochastic characteristics). However, each of the 40 testing IVUS frames considered can be regarded as a separate dataset. Under this scope, it is possible to apply the nonparametric statistical tests proposed in ( Dem  X  ar, 2006; Garc X a et al., 2009;
Derrac et al., 2011 ) for evaluating the statistical signi multiple datasets. Speci fi cally, we employ Friedman's test for comparing multiple classi fi ers and Holm's test as the post hoc procedure, whereas the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test is considered for pair-wise comparisons. All the aforementioned statistical tests are applied considering the typical value of a  X  0.05 as level of signi fi cance. We employ a directional alternative hypothesis for the Wilcoxon's test, since our objective is to determine which one of the two compared classi fi ers exhibits signi fi cantly higher accuracy, if the null hypothesis can be rejected.
Accordingly, one-tailed critical values (at the a  X  0.05 level of signi fi cance) are considered. In applying the three aforementioned statistical tests, we fi rst calculate the classi fi cation accuracy for each IVUS frame and each classi fi er independently, averaged over the ten runs (if the respective classi fi er exhibits stochastic char-acteristics). Subsequently, the average accuracy over the 40 frames is calculated for all classi fi ers, upon which the null hypotheses of the statistical tests actually refer to. 5.2. Comparison with other classi fi ers by all classi fi ers considered in the present study (described in
Section 5.1 ), along with their most signi fi cant structural character-istics. The average runtime required for training the classi also provided. Arguably, FaIRLiC resulted in compact rule bases, comprising on average 8.0 fuzzy rules and 5.75 features per rule.
Moreover, only 37.2 out of the 175 available features are globally maintained in the fi nal classi fi cation models. At the same time, it exhibits the highest testing classi fi cation accuracy, closely fol-lowed by the second best FURIA. Regarding the other GFRBCSs, 2SLAVE-2 achieved the overall third highest classi fi cation accu-racy, displaying however a relatively aggravated model complex-ity. In particular, this algorithm requires a very high number of globally active features, which hinders the interpretation of the classi fi er. On the other hand, SGERD produced the simplest rule bases, at the cost however of a reduced testing performance.
Finally, the crisp classi fi ers resulted in signi fi cantly more complex structures, without exhibiting any merits with respect to the classi fi cation accuracy.
 user's accuracies in the testing set for all algorithms and each class separately. Table 5 also provides the overall and the average (per class) accuracies for each classi fi er. Both of these measures are equally important; whereas the former (also reported in Table 4 ) represents the typical accuracy reported in classi fi cation tasks, the latter re fl ects the ability of the classi fi er to correctly identify patterns belonging to any class, irrespective of the class propor-tions in the dataset. The two tables indicate that FaIRLiC achieves the highest average producer's and user's accuracies, exhibiting at the same time the highest overall accuracy. It is important to notice that these results are achieved even though our classi never exhibits the highest producer's accuracy for an individual class. This fact indicates that FaIRLiC is able to achieve a good balance in identifying all classes at the same time. For example, the SGERD algorithm exhibits a relatively high producer's accuracy for the fi bro-lipid class, at the cost of reduced user's accuracy for FL and lower accuracies for the fi rst two classes. On the other hand,
Slipper achieves a high accuracy for the fi brous class, but under-estimates the necrotic core class to a considerable degree.
Table 7 reports the average classi fi cation accuracies obtained for each IVUS frame of the testing dataset. The results closely support the observations derived so far. Note that the average classi fi cation accuracies reported in Table 7 are slightly reduced compared to overall accuracies shown in Table 4 , because the former were averaged over each frame whereas the latter consider the patterns of the testing dataset as a whole, as it was explained in Section 5.1 . Table 8 hosts the results of Friedman's test with respect to the average accuracies presented in Table 7 . FaIRLiC achieved the lowest ranking among all classi fi ers. Both the Fried-man statistic (distributed under  X  2 with 8 degrees of freedom) and the Iman  X  Davenport statistic (distributed under F with 8 and 312 degrees of freedom) strongly support the rejection of the null hypothesis. Applying Holm's post hoc procedure with FaIRLiC as the control method ( Table 9 ), the null hypothesis is accepted for FURIA, while all other hypotheses are rejected. Employing, how-ever, the Wilcoxon test ( Table 10 ), all pair-wise comparisons reject the null hypothesis and the alternative directional hypothesis in favor of FaIRLiC can be supported in all cases.

The relatively low producer's accuracy values for the fi bro-lipid class obtained in this study, are attributed to the low gray-level range, its poor texture appearance and the high spectral mixing with the fi brous class. Several studies in the literature stress out the dif fi culties in discriminating between fi brous and tissues. Gonzalo et al. Vince et al. (2000) investigate the relation-ship between visual assessment of gray-scale IVUS images by experienced observers and the plaque composition analysis as provided by VH. The producer's accuracy reported in this study was about 50% for both fi brous and fi bro-lipid. Histological matching comparisons between gray-scale IVUS and pathology resulted in producer's accuracies of 50% and 40  X  46% for and fatty plaques, respectively ( Hiro et al., 1997; Peters et al., 1994 ). Another factor related with the above issue is the reliability of classi fi cation assignments for fi bro-lipid provided by VH which are used here as target values of tissue patterns from the IVUS images. As reported in ( Nair et al., 2002 ), the VH method exhibits a producer's accuracy for the fi bro-lipid class in the range of 40% when employing either AR or wavelet spectral features. This outcome is partially attributed to the de fi nition of fi regions in the study. In particular, all areas from histology images with very mild lipid accumulation (mostly fi brous) to very heavy lipid accumulation (lipid rich cores) are assigned to the class, thus resulting in the spectral overlapping between the fi brous and fi bro-lipid classes. In this context, we argue that the lower producer's accuracy in the detection of fi bro-lipid shown by FaIRLiC is not mainly due to the inability of our classi fi discriminate fi bro-lipid from fi brous but rather to the inef of fi bro-lipidic labeling by VH, which causes dif fi culties in establishing the correct association between the IVUS image texture and the fi bro-lipid targets. For a more accurate detection of lipid laden plaques, the research activity has directed towards wavelet analysis from RF signals ( Murashige et al., 2005 ).
The aforementioned comments can be further validated through a careful inspection of the attained producer's ( Table 5 ) and user's ( Table 6 ) accuracies. Indeed, all classi fi ers achieve producer's accuracy around 40% for the fi bro-lipid class, with two notable exceptions: the SGERD and the Slipper classi fi Compared to FaIRLiC, SGERD attains higher producer's accuracy for the fi bro-lipid class, but with a lower user's accuracy. This indicates that the latter classi fi er actually overestimates the fi bro-lipid class to a larger extend, characterizing non fi lipidic areas as fi bro-lipidic ones. Fibro-lipid exhibits a high degree of overlapping mostly with fi brous, whereas the overlapping with the other two classes is minimal. Therefore, SGERD's higher producer's accuracy for the fi bro-lipid class results in a reduced producer's accuracy for the fi brous class. Since the latter class comprises fi ve times more patterns that the former in the testing dataset (see Section 5.1 ), the absolute decrease in fi brous' cer's accuracy is less apparent than the increase in fi bro-lipid's one. However, taking into consideration the actual number of patterns per class, we can conclude that SGERD's higher producer accuracy observed for the fi bro-lipid class leads to a direct over-estimation against fi brous. A similar behavior can also be observed (albeit to a lesser extent) for the C4.5 Rules algorithm as well. On the other hand, the application of Slipper results in signi reduced producer's accuracy for fi bro-lipid, with a respective increase in fi brous' producer's accuracy; in other words, Slipper demonstrates the opposite behavior to SGERD and C4.5 Rules in that respect. Hence, we can conclude that the low fi bro-lipid producer's accuracies observed for all classi fi ers are a consequence of the VH labeling and its limitations (as described above), combined with the fact that the class is represented by a relatively small number of patterns in the testing set, rather than a systemic problem of the classi fi ers in correctly identifying the particular class. As the sample results of Fig. 7 indicate, the main portion of fi bro-lipid regions in the images are generally identi fi ed (by
FaIRLiC in this fi gure) to a satisfactory degree. 5.3. Comparison with IBH
The results presented in Tables 5 and 6 also show that our method  X  with four classes  X  is favorably compared to the IBH method, a state-of-the-art methodology in tissue characterizations based on the IVUS-VH framework (see Section 2.2 ). In their most recent publication ( Taki et al., 2013 ), the authors report producer's accuracies of 80.1% for calcium, 89.6% for fi brous and 56.6% for the necrotic core class, assuming an in vivo dataset with 120 labeled IVUS frames. Despite the spectral overlapping of necrotic core with calcium and the subsequent dif fi culties in distinguishing between these classes, our approach is able to discriminate more effectively the necrotic core class with a producer's accuracy of 81.11%. A basic difference though is that the proposed algorithm offers the additional asset of classifying the fi bro-lipid class individually, thereby assisting to a more accurate identi fi cation of vulnerable plaques. However, if we consider the fi brous and fi bro-lipid classes as one, FaIRLiC exhibits a producer's accuracy of 92.81% for the combined class, which is higher than IBH's reported one. 5.4. Advantages of linguistic classi fi cation
As mentioned in Section 3.1 , our method adheres to VH reference maps for patterns labeling. As a result, the obtained classi fi cation results are validated against the ECG-gaited IVUS-VH cross-sectional frames. This property offers two main advantages in tissue characterization. The fi rst one is that we exploit a more reliable target mechanism derived by RF signal analysis with accurate correlation to histological data, thus avoiding the varia-bility arising from visual assessments by experienced observers. The second advantage is that the constructed classi fi er is able of characterizing the intermediate IVUS frames not processed by VH. The resulting increase of longitudinal resolution allows the mon-itoring of the plaque volumes along the coronary arteries.
The previous section demonstrated the ability of FaIRLiC's learning algorithm in producing simple fuzzy rule bases with high generalization properties. This section describes some other advantages of applying a linguistic classi fi er to the problem of tissue characterization. Actually, the analysis of Section 4.3 already suggested that an FRBCS can provide an analyst with deeper insight on the underlying physical principles governing the tissue classi fi cation problem. Here we will further elaborate on some additional advantageous aspects of the proposed methodology.
One of the merits of the proposed scheme relates to the fact that each rule (which describes a single class label) uses only a small subset of the available features. This property permits the calculation of the frequency with which each feature appears in the rules of the rule base, globally or in a per class basis. Since a FaIRLiC model comprises 8 rules on average (see Table 4 ), we can intuitively consider a feature as a signi fi cant one if it exhibits a frequency of appearance greater or equal to 1/8  X  12.5%, at least for one class (that is, if it appears consistently in at least one rule). Table 11 presents all such features, sorted according to their frequency of appearance irrespective of class (last column of the table). Following the above rule, a total for 36 features are deemed signi fi cant at least for one class. Frequency values equal or greater than 12.5% are highlighted in boldface in the table, in a per class basis. In view of the ranking list of feature's usage by FaIRLiC the following comments are in order: (1) A fi rst observation is that each class generally requires different (2) Features derived from FO statistics (primarily gray-level means (3) The intensity (gray-level value) feature is ranked low accord-(4) Another observation is that generally different window sizes (5) A fi nal observation is that the each feature's order of signi -
The embedded feature selection properties of FaIRLiC's learning algorithm guarantee that the selected features are well-suited for the speci fi c classi fi er. In order to prove this assertion, we con-ducted additional experiments in a reduced feature space. In particular, we only maintained the set of 36 features presented previously. Table 12 presents the results of all classi fi ered on this reduced feature space, following the same represen-tation with Table 4 . From the accuracy point of view, a slight increase is observed for all algorithms, with the relative gain being higher for the 2SLAVE-2 and SVM, which exhibit the overall second and fourth highest accuracy, respectively, in this space.
From the structural characteristics point of view, the reduced feature space resulted in simpler FaIRLiC models, although the differences are not extremely big. Taking into consideration, however, that the latter space is more than six times smaller than the original feature space, we argue that FaIRLiC can achieve nearly optimal structural characteristics for the original feature space as well. The difference is much bigger for most of the other classi fi ers, especially in terms of globally active features. ical results are shown here for brevity in the presentation), FaIRLiC still achieves the lowest Friedman's ranking. Both Holm's and Wilcoxon's tests accepts the null hypothesis against FURIA and 2SLAVE-2, imply-ing that these algorithms are statistically equivalent with FaIRLiC in terms of classi fi cation accuracy. They are still characterized by more complex structures though, exhibiting much higher number of rules and approximately two times more features per rule. Hence, almost all available features are being globally used by their rule bases, contrary to FaIRLiC that evaluates approximately half of the available features. by FaIRLiC (both in the full and the reduced feature space) is that we are led to considerable reduction of the computational load pertaining to the feature extraction stage. It should be noticed that feature extraction constitutes the major burden in the assessment of a single IVUS image in real time. Further, in order to accurately track the plaque component variations along the coronary vessels, a large number of consecutive IVUS frames should be character-ized. The above remarks suggest that the cost reduction has an important impact from operational point view. In order to quantify this effect, we obtained the per frame computation times required for the extraction of each feature, averaged over all 40 IVUS images of the testing dataset. The full space comprising the 175 features spent 17.39 min. to complete the feature extraction stage. In regard to our approach, the computation times are further avera-ged over the feature subsets globally maintained by FaIRLiC, on each of the 10 executions of the algorithm. The subset of 37.2 features ( Table 4 ) took approximately 3.52 min., whereas the fur-ther reduced subset of 18.60 features (Table 12) required 1.64 min.
Thus, in addition to its high generalization accuracy, FaIRLiC is also proven fruitful with respect to time ef fi ciency, providing substan-tial computation savings compared to the use of the full feature space. We should note that the feature extraction processes were implemented using the MATLAB software package. To this extent, the reported absolute extraction time measurements are only illustrative of the reduction ratio resulting from FaIRLiC's embedded feature selection properties. The absolute feature extraction times can be greatly reduced if one considers an optimized C  X  X  implementation.

For reasons of completeness, Table 13 presents the equivalent feature extraction time metrics for all algorithms considered. Since most algorithms evaluate a much higher number of globally active features, the respective time requirements for feature extraction is higher than FaIRLiC's ones. A noticeable behavior observed in Table 13 is the extremely low time requirements for SGERD. For all 10 runs (in both the full and the reduced feature space), SGERD's models select only fi rst order statistical features, th e computational requirements of which are trivial. This fact is a possible explanation of the algorithm's cannot effectively discriminate classes with high textural variations, such as fi brous and fi bro-lipid.

As a last example, we present some simple fi ltering techniques that can be applied, using the rule base example of Section 4.3 .
Consider the second rule of Fig. 6 (the fourth rule of the whole rule base of Fig. 5 ), which describes the necrotic core class label. The antecedent part of the rule can actually be considered as a fuzzy description of the respective class. The rule involves one feature and, as explained in Section 4.3 , the composite fuzzy set can be described by the equivalent trapezoidal fuzzy set. If we derive the matching degrees (7) of the rule for all image pixels, we can obtain a fuzzy characterization for the necrotic core class, as depicted in
Fig. 8 (b). In this fi gure, bright colors represent matching degrees close to unity, whereas darker regions achieve activations close to zero. We can further simplify this procedure by considering all pixels that achieve a matching degree higher than 0.5 (that is, all pixels located in the core of the fuzzy rule) as necrotic core pixels. The result is displayed in Fig. 8 (c). The procedure constitutes a simple thresholding technique, applied only to the FO:mean(11) feature, and can be used for the real-time identi fi cation of any tissue type. In effect, the only computations that need to be performed are those associated with the derivation of the textural feature, which are rather trivial in the case of fi rst order features. Fig. 8 (d) and (e) present the same technique applied for the lipid class, using the last rule of the rule base depicted in Fig. 6 . These characterizations may not be as accurate as the classi results of Fig. 7 , but they can provide a very fast identi any class of interest. Indeed, if we compare the obtained results with the equivalent VH targets of Fig. 8 (a), we can assert that they represent a coarse characterization of the respective regions to a satisfactory degree. Furthermore, the fuzzy images ( Fig. 8 (b)) are equally important, since they provide to the physician the infor-mation about the certainty of the classi fi cation, in addition to the crisp labeling. We should note that such fi lters can be applied irrespective of the number of features involved in the derived rules. Nevertheless, FaIRLiC's ef fi cient local feature selection char-acteristics assist the real-time application of such fi lters, since only few textural features (one per class in our example) need to be derived. 6. Conclusions and future work
This paper presented the applicat ion of a GFRBCS, namely FaIRLiC, for the problem of tissue characterization from intravascular ultra-sound (IVUS) images. Several families of textural features at different scales were considered, in order to increase the discrimination between the classes. The employed FaIRLiC algorithm can effectively exploit all the provided information, evaluating only the necessary subset of features in a per rule basis. Thus, relatively small classi tion models are produced, which can aid the analyst under-stand which features are relevant for a correct classi fi how they discriminate the various classes. The extensive experi-mental analysis presented proved that FaIRLiC can achieve high classi fi cation accuracy, with compact derived models and high generalization properties, as compared to a number of other well-known classi fi ers of the literature.

As future work, we are considering certain extensions of the suggested approach, primarily by resorting to the additional information provided by RF signals. One possibility along this direction is to exploit the textural analysis from IVUS images reconstructed by RF processing, while the second one is to extract detailed features from RF spectra. It should be noticed that the
FaIRLiC classi fi er is able to explore effectively the highly dimen-sional feature spaces formed by combining both textural and spectral features. Following the fi ndings obtained in the current framework, we expect that the embedded feature selection cap-abilities, the creation of compact rule bases and the linguistic interpretability of FaIRLiC will provide more valuable and reliable results in regard to the analysis of plaque composition.
