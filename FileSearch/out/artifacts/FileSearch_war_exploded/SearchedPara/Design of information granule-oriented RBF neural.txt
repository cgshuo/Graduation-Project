 1. Introduction
Recently, the growing interest in the methodology and techni-various areas of science and engineering ( Pedrycz and Vasilakos 2000; Shaheen et al., 2010; Warne et al., 2004; del-Hoyo et al., research has demonstrated that various CI techniques can support the design of models with better model performance than those being obtained when using a single  X  X  X onventional X  X  technique.
Alongthisline,CIcanprovidewithsubstantialabilitiestocopewith evident complexity of industrial processes and necessity to come up with effective mechanisms of learning and adaptation. This radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, to modeling and prediction of power supply for high-field magnet (PSHFM) ( Iwasa 2001; Chung et al., 2004, 2005, 2006 ).

One of the most effective methods to accomplish the high-field magnet is to utilize the superconducting wire. The superconduct-ing applications, i.e., nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance image (MRI) have been commercialized with recent advances in fabrication technology of high temperature superconducting (HTS) wires have brought essential possibilities of the HTS material that is much higher than that of the LTS material, which constitutes a significant achievement. Thus, the and the HTS insert coil (BSCCO 2212) in the hybrid NMR spectro-meter magnet. However, due to the lack of homogeneity of the HTS should be compensated in order to maintain stable properties of beenexpectedtobeanimportantoptiontomaintainthestabilityof Hoyo et al., 2009 ). Given this, we have proposed a new type superconducting power supply for high-field magnet with an Nb currentratesofthePSHFMdependontheloadmagnet.Toapplythe
LTMFP to the real scale NMR magnet, it becomes necessary to determine a relation between pumping current rate and induc-tance of the load magnet.

Because of the attractive simple topological structure and engineeringapplications,see Vongetal. (2006) , ZhaiandYu(2009) , and Langoni et al. (2006 ).

However such networks exhibit two main drawbacks when it 2002 ): to be determined a priori or modified within training by some heuristics, which results in a non-optimal network structure. localminima.Variouswaysofpreventingthisproblem,suchas early stopping, weight decay, etc., were employed. However, those methods may negatively affect the generalization cap-abilities of the resulting network.

To alleviate the drawbacks associated with the RBF neural net-work, we introduce information granule-oriented RBF neural net-( MacQueen, 1967; Bezdek, 1981 ) and genetic optimization, and predominantly data driven constructs whose processing is based upon an effective usage of experimental data through a prudent process of information granulation and genetic optimization.
Two ultimate objectives of this study are: (i) to develop a comprehensive design methodology of information granule-oriented RBF neural networks and (ii) to discuss its application to a power supply for high-field magnet for modeling and predic-tion purposes.

For effective modeling and to achieve accurate prediction abilities of the proposed model, the underlying design strategy and diverse ways of their development are being discussed. Here with K-Means clustering ( MacQueen, 1967 ) and receptive fields formed by the FCM clustering ( Bezdek, 1981 ). Second, a genetic to optimize the essential parameters of the proposed RBF neural network. When we used K-Means clustering for the Gaussian hidden layer are selected by the GA. In case of FCM-generated nodes in the hidden layer of the networks are also optimized.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the linear-type superconducting power supply is introduced. Section 3 presents the basic topology and design methodology of the general RBF neural networks and the information granule-oriented RBF neural network. The clustering method and the GA applied to the optimization of the proposed model are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we describe a method of model selection using the
LOOCV (leave-one-out cross-validation) technique. Section 6 pre-sents the results obtained from a simulation as well as the experimental study. Conclusions are covered in Section 7. 2. Power supply for high-field magnet 2.1. Operating principle and underlying structure
The basic principle of the superconducting power supply can be in thickness, and superconducting niobium X  X itanium alloy (NbTi) Permanent magnet Permanent magnet Permanent magnet Magnetic flux 40 75 state. When normal spot passes through the Nb foil by moving the ing loop. Therefore, the induced current I can be generated by ing power supply, we develop a new type power supply for high-field magnet (PSHFM) ( Chung et al., 2004; Chung et al., 2005 ).

Furthermore, in order to achieve the optimal design of the practical PSHFM system, the fundamental operatingcharacteristics of pumping currents rates under different kinds of load magnet should be expected.

In order to accomplish effective modeling and secure high magnet (PSHFM), we split the overall input X  X utput dataset into five groups denoted here as V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5; refer to Table 1 . 3. The information granule-oriented radial basis function neural network 3.1. General topology of the RBF neural network
RBF neural networks ( Vong et al., 2006; Zhai and Yu, 2009; Park et al., 2006 ) have been traditionally associated with a simple architecture of a three-layer neural network, in which an n -dimensional input vector x  X  [ x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ] T
RBF neural network is shown in Fig. 7 . Here we display the functions, the input vector x  X  [ x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ] T vector U  X  ( F 1 ( x ), F 2 ( x ), y , F K ( x )), where F basis function.

F  X  x  X  X  exp computed as a linear combination of the individual activation levels, that is y  X  x  X  X 
Thus RBF neural networks can be treated as three-layered topologies, see Fig. 7 .
 Some commonly encountered choices of RBFs are shown
Table 2 . Among these, the Gaussian RBF is the most commonly flexibility associated with the values of its parameters.
As the structure of the RBF NNs implies, the design of any RBF neural network comprises two major phases such as: (a) the development of the receptive fields and (b) optimization of the connections of the neuron positioned at the output layer of optimization task (which is quite standard minimization problem of parametric nature). 3.2.

In this section, we briefly recall the main development aspects of K-Means ( MacQueen, 1967 ) and fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithms ( Bezdek 1981 ), which form the fundamentals of the proposed model. The proposed IG-oriented RBFNN includes two versions: (a) using K-Means clustering to find the prototype of Gaussian functions when we use Gaussian functionas an activation method and using the induced activation functions as ensuing receptive fields. function

In this paper, we used expression (9) to serve as an activation function of receptive fields.
 4.2. Genetic optimization
Genetic algorithms (GAs) ( Holland, 1975; Goldberg, 1989; Jong, combinatorial problems. Given the population-oriented nature of the underlying search, they do not easily get trapped in local minima as opposed to gradient decent techniques being quite susceptible to this shortcoming.

Proceeding with the optimization details, the GA use the serial in the realization of the mutation operator.

For the experimental dataset, the model selection procedure is based on establishing a sound compromise between model X  X  approximation and generalization abilities. The main performance measures that we use here are the MSE (the standard mean square error) as expressed in (5). For quantifying the generalization abilities, many estimates have been proposed in the literature; foldcross-validation estimate( Bishop,1995 ).

The aim is to model the power supply for high-field magnet. The dataset was obtained from experimentation with the PSHFM. The dataset contains 26 input X  X utput pairs shown in Table 1 .
We consider the MSE of Eq. (5) as the underlying performance index. The approximation ability is expressed in terms of the performance index when using the entire dataset and the general-ization is quantified by running the LOOCV technique ( Bishop, 1995; Kearns and Ron, 1997; Kemerer, 1987 ).

For the optimization of the proposed model, we apply the genetic design. When we used K-Means clustering for the Gaussian basis function, the width ( r ) of the Gaussian function and the algorithm (GAs). When we used the activation function produced number of nodes in the hidden layer ( c) are selected. 6.1. The performance analysis: K-Means clustering
