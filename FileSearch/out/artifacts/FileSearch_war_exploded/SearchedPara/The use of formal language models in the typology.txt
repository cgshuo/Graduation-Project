 It has been proved (Johnson, 1972; Kaplan and Kay, 1994) that regular models have an expre-sive power equal to the noncyclic components of generative grammmars representing the mor-phophonology of natural languages. However, these works make no considerations about what class of formal languages is the natural for de-scribing the morphology of one particular lan-guage. On the other hand, the criteria of classi-fication of Amerindian languages, do not involve complexity criteria. In order to establish crite-ria that take into account the complexity of the description we present two contrasting examples in two Argentinean native languages: toba and quichua santiague  X  no. While the quichua has a nat-ural representation in terms of a regular language using two level morphology, we will show that the Toba morphology has a more natural representa-tion in terms of linear context-free languages. The quichua santiague  X  no is a language of the Quechua language family. It is spoken in the San-tiago del Estero state, Argentina. Typologically is an agglutinative language and its structure is al-most exclusively based on the use of suffixes and is extremely regular. The morphology takes a domi-nant part in this language with a rich set of valida-tion suffixes. The quichua santiague  X  no has a much simpler phonologic system that other languages of this family: for example it has no series of aspi-rated or glottalized stops.

Since the description of the verbal morphology is rich enough for our aim to expose the regular na-ture of quichua santiague  X  no morphology, we have restricted our study to the morphology of finite verbs forms. We use the two level morphology paradigm to express with finite regular transduc-ers the rules that clearly illustrate how naturally this language phonology is regular. The construc-tion uses the descriptive works of Alderetes (2001) and Nardi (Albarrac  X   X n et. al, 2002) 109 2.1 Phonological two level rules for the In this section we present the alphabet of the quichua santiague  X  no with which we have imple-mented the quichua phonological rules in the par-adigm of two level morphology. The subsets abbreviations are: V (vowel), Vlng (underlying vowel).Valt (high vowel),VMed (median vowel), Vbaj (bass vowel) , Ftr (trasparent to medializa-tion phonema), Cpos (posterior consonant).

With the aim of showing the simplicity of the phonologic rules we transcribe the two-level rules we have implemeted with the transducers in the thesis. R1-R4 model the medialization vowels procesess, R5-R7 are elision and ephentesis proce-sess with very specific contexts and R7 represents a diachornic phonological process with a subja-cent form present in others quechua dialects.

This implemented automata is presented in Fig-ure 1. This description of the morphophonology was implemented using PC-KIMMO (Antworth, 1990) The Toba language belongs, with the languages pilaga, mocovi and kaduveo, to the guaycuru language family (Messineo, 2003; Klein, 1978). The toba is spoken in the Gran Chaco region (which is comprised between Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay) and in some reduced settlements near Buenos Aires, Argentina. From the point of view of the morphologic typology it presents char-acteristics of a polysynthetic agglutinative lan-guage. In this language the verb is the morpho-logically more complex wordclass. The grammat-ical category of person is prefixed to the verbal theme. There are suffixes to indicate plurals and other grammatical categories as aspect, location-direction, reflexive and reciprocal and desidera-tive mode. The verb has no mark of time. As an example of a typical verb we can considerate the sanadatema : Example 1 .
One of the characteristics of the toba verb mor-phology is a system of markation active-inactive on the verbal prefixes (Messineo, 2003; Klein, 1978). There are in this language two sets or ver-bal prefixes that mark action: 1. Class I (In):codifies inactive participants, ob-2. Class II(Act): codifies active participants, 110
Actor Fut Fut 111
The toba has a great quantity of morphological processes that involve interactions between suf-fixes and prefixes. In the next example the suffix-ation of the reflexive (  X  l at ) forces the use of the active person with prefixes of the voice medium class because the agent is affected by the action. Example 2 .
The agglutination of this suffix occurs in the last suffix box (after locatives, directional and other derivational suffixes). Then, if we model this process using finite automata we will add many items to the lexicon (Sproat, 1992). The derivation of names from verbs is very productive. There are many nominalizer suffixes. The result-ing names use obligatory possessing person nom-inal prefixes.
 Example 3 .
The toba language also presents a complex sys-tem of causative suffixes that act as switching the transitivity of the verb. Transitivity is specially ap-preciable in the switching of the 3rd person prefix mark. In section 3.2 we will use this process to show how linear context free grammars are a better than regular grammars for modeling agglutination in this language, but first we will present the for-mer class of languages and its acceptor automata. 3.1 Linear context free languages and A linear context-free language is a language gen-erated by a grammar context-free grammars G in which every production has one of the three forms (Creider et al., 1995): 1. A  X  a , with a terminal symbol 2. A  X  aB , with B a non terminal symbol and 3. A  X  Ba , with B a non terminal symbol and
Linear context-free grammars have been stud-ied by Rosenberg (1967) who showed that there is an equivalence between them and two-taped nondeterministic finite-state automata. Informally, a two-head nondeterministic finite-state automata could be thought as a generalization of a usual nondeterministic finite-state automata which has two read heads that independently reads in two dif-ferent tapes, and at each transition only one tape moves. When both tapes have been processed, if the automata is at a final state, the parsing is suc-cessful. In the ambit that we are studying we can think that if a word is a string of prefixes, a stem and suffixes, one automata head will read will the prefixes and the other the suffixes. Taking into account that linear grammars are in Rosenberg X  X  terms:  X  The lowest class of nonregular context-free grammars X , Creider et al. (1995) have taken this formal language class as the optimal to model morphological processes that involve interaction between prefixes and suffixes. 3.2 Analysis of the third person verbal In this section we model the morphology of the third person of transitive verbs using two-taped fi-nite nondeterministics automata. The modeling of this person is enough to show this description ad-vantages with respect to others in terms of regular languages. The transitivity of the verb plays an im-portant role in the selection of the person marker Class. The person markers are (Messineo, 2003): 1. i-/y-for transitive verbs y and some intra-2. d(Vowel) for verbs typically intransitives (Pr 3. n: subjets of medium voice (Pr ActM).

The successive application of the causative seems to act here, as was interpreted by Buckwal-ter (2001), like making the switch in the original verb transitivity as is shown en Example 4 in the next page. 112 Example 4 .
 IV de-que X  X  he eats TV i-qui X  -aGan he eats(something) IV de-qui X  -aGanataGan he feeds TV i-qui X  -aGanataGanaGan he feeds(a person) IV de qui X  -aGanaGanataGan he command to feed
If we want to model this morphological process using finite automata again we must enlarge the lexicon size. The resulting grammar, althought capable of modeling the morphology of the toba, would not work effectively. The effectiveness of a grammar is a measure of their productivity (Heintz, 1991). Taking into account the productiv-ity of causative and reflexive verbal derivation we will prefer a description in terms of a context-free linear grammar with high effectivity than another using regular languages with low effectivity.
To model the behavior of causative agglutina-tion and the interaction with person prefixes us-ing the two-head automata, we define two paths determined by the parity of the causative suffixes wich have been agglutinated to the verb. We have also to take into consideration the optative pos-terior aglutination of reflexive and reciprocal suf-fixes wich forces the use of medium voice person prefix. From the third person is also formed the third person indefinite actor from a prefix, qa -, which is at left and adjacent to the usual mark of the third person and after the mark of negation sa -. Therefore, their agglutination is reserved to the last transitions. The resulting two-typed automata showed in Figure 2 also takes into account the rel-ative order of the boxes and so the mutual restric-tions between them (Klein, 1978). It is interesting to note that phonological rules in toba can be naturally expressed by regular Finite Transducers. There are, however, many South American native languages that presents morpho-logical processes analogous to the Toba and some can present phonological processes that will have a more natural expression using Linear Finite Transducers. For example the Guarani language presents nasal harmony which expands from the root to both suffixes and prefixes (Krivoshein, 1994). This kind of characterization can have some value in language classification and the mod-eling of the great diversity of South American lan-guages morphology can allow to obtain a formal concept of natural description of a language. .
