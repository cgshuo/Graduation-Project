 1. Introduction
Refining process is one of the most energy-intensive indus-tries, whose energy cost is the second-largest cost component after crude and intermediate products. Among all kinds of the consumed energy sources, fuel gas which is continuously generated during the production process contributes most of the primary energy source to the energy needs of the refinery. Furthermore, fuel gas can be converted into other forms of energy, such as steam, electricity and heat. Therefore, the effective scheduling of the fuel gas system plays a central role in energy cost reduction and cleaner production in refinery process.
Little research work has been reported on the optimal scheduling of the fuel gas system in refinery. It is always referred as an important part in the analysis of the whole refinery energy system. Frangopoulos et al. (1996) presented a method for the thermoeconomic operation optimization of a refinery combined-cycle cogeneration system. By the analysis of the interrelation-ships among various energy sources, such as fuel gas, fuel oil, steam and electricity, an energy system planning model was formulated. Nevertheless, the capacity of the fuel gas drum and the gas vessels was not considered because of the large time granularity. White (2005) proposed the concept of the fuel gas balance and recommended to model the planning model of the site-wide energy system integrating fuel gas, steam and elec-tricity. Zhang and Hua (2007) embedded the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model of utility system which included the fuel gas system into the plant-wide planning model for overall optimization and better energy efficiency, and the proposed approach was executed in an example provided by a real refinery. Li et al. (2006) developed a plant-wide multi-period planning model for a refinery complex. By considering the fuel oil and fuel gas produced in the refinery plant and the steam and electricity plants in the complex is taken into account. Therefore, the plant-wide optimization can be achieved. Zhang and Rong (2008) proposed an MILP model for multi-period optimization of fuel gas system scheduling in refinery, and then gave a marginal value analysis of the system. Some suggestions are also made by the analysis to assist the engineering operation in refinery. Some research works related with the optimal scheduling of fuel gas system in iron-and steel-making process have been reported. Akimoto et al. (1991) proposed a multi-period MILP model which considered the drum level control and the optimal distribution of fuel gas in the power plant of steel works.

Dstm ; B ; t fuzzy prediction of demand amount of steam from Bemporad and Morari (1999) proposed a framework for modeling and controlling the Mixed Logical Dynamical (MLD) systems, and a simulation case study on a complex fuel gas supply system was reported. Kim et al. (2003) presented a further consideration on the problem. They took the cost of turn on/off of the burner into consideration and proposed a plant-wide multi-period MILP model to determine the optimal energy supply to meet the varying energy demands.

However, these researches constructed the model of fuel gas system without considering its imprecise natures. In fact, input data and related parameters, such as available supply, forecast demand and cost coefficients, are always imprecise because some information is incomplete or unavailable over the scheduling horizon. In order to avoid unrealistic modeling and improper decisions, the use of fuzzy mathematical programming can be recommended. Fuzzy mathematical programming, first intro-duced by Bellman and Zadeh (1970) , is developed to treat the uncertainty in optimization problems. Inuiguchi et al. (1994) classified this method into two categories in view of the kinds of the treated uncertainties: fuzzy flexible programming (FFP) and fuzzy possibilistic programming (FPP). In the FFP methods, fuzzy constraints and fuzzy goals, which represent the flexibility in the constraints and fuzziness in the objective, are introduced into ordinary mathematical programming models. On the other hand, in the FPP methods, uncertainty parameters in mathema-tical programming models are considered as fuzzy numbers associated with possibility distributions on their values. FPP has been applied with considerable acceptance since it was first presented.

Zadeh (1978) used fuzzy sets as a basis to derive the theory of possibility in his pioneering work. After his initial study, possibility theory has played a vital role in resolving practical decision-making problems. Lai and Hwang (1992) proposed an auxiliary multiple objective linear programming model to solve the possibilistic programming problem. An investment problem was solved to illustrate that this strategy could simultaneously maximize the most possible value of the imprecise profit, minimize the risk of obtaining lower profit and maximize the possibility of obtaining higher profit. Sun et al. (2000) formulated the optimal natural gas pipeline operation problem in which customer demand was a fuzzy variable specified by its possibility distribution. Sadeghi and Hosseini (2006) used fuzzy coefficients to deal with the investment cost uncertainty in energy supply planning problem. O  X  zgen et al. (2008) developed a two phase possibilistic programming method for multi-objective supplier evaluation and order allocation problems. Liang (2007a) and (2007b) presented an interactive possibilistic linear programming approach for solving the aggregate production planning problem and distribution planning problem respectively. Industrial cases demonstrated that the interactive method in the solution procedure will help to yield a set of efficient compromise solutions with high satisfaction degree. Other studies on the FPP method include Muela et al. (2007) , Wang and Shu (2007) , Vasant et al. (2008) and Torabi and Hassini (2008) .

Although FPP models have been widely applied to modeling, few research works have been reported on the performance evaluations, namely sensitivity analysis, of these models. Hsieh and Wu (2000) proposed a possibilistic linear programming model for aggregate planning problem with imprecise natures, and simulated the imprecise natures to evaluate their effect to production plans. Tang et al. (2003) also used the simulation method to analyze the performance and effect of the fuzzy coefficients to the aggregate planning problem. These researches both used the simulation method to give the sensitivity analysis. However, the evaluation procedure which involved substantive numerical experiments has to be re-executed in order to obtain the right result once the parameters in the model are changed.

From the above discussion, this study will employ the FPP method to establish a possibilistic model for optimal fuel gas scheduling in refinery involving imprecise supply, demands and cost. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of the possibilistic model will also be given in this paper, and it is implemented by the method of marginal value analysis, which will faci-litate the evaluation procedure. The rest of the paper is orga-nized as follows: Section 2 describes the fuel gas scheduling problem. Section 3 presents the mathematical formulation of the scheduling problem in detail, where imprecise natures are considered. This is followed by the sensitivity analysis of the fuzzy possibilistic model. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 5. 2. Problem statement
Fig. 1 (Zhang and Rong, 2008 ) shows the schematic representation of a simple refinery process. The dashed line in the figure represents the gas flow. The gases are collected in the gas plant which consists of hydrocarbon recycle equipments and desulfuration equipments. The hydrocarbon recycle equipments in gas plant recover light hydrocarbons (C 3 and C olefins) from gas streams which are always called low-pressure fuel gas, and separates refinery gas components including butanes for alkylation, pentanes for gasoline blending, LPG X  X  for final product and ethane for petrochemicals. Furthermore, the lighter fractions are separated from heavier fractions by lean oil ~

FO ; k ; t 0 X 1 variables that denotes whether the consumption absorption and then desulfurized for use as fuel gas. There are generally two kinds of fuel gases in refinery: low-pressure fuel gas (LP gas) and high-pressure fuel gas (HP gas). Almost all of the processes in the refinery produce LP gas, and most of the
HP gas is from the operations of desulfuration equipments and some other equipments, as shown in Fig. 2 . Because of the unsatisfied characteristic of LP fuel gas, especially the high percentage of sulfide, little LP gas can be burned as fuel directly. Consequently, LP gas is always compressed to higher pressure and then desulfurized in desufuration equipments to compensate the shortage of HP gas which can be used as fuel directly by all of the heaters and boilers. Before this conversion, LP gas is stored in gas drum.

The rate of consumption of fuel gas must always equal the rate of production in order to guarantee the safety and the stability of the refinery process. Fuel gas unbalance occurs frequently in the refinery process because of the limited capacity of the fuel gas drum and the HP gas vessels and causes the excess or shortage of fuel gas in the fuel gas system. Larger fuel gas supply than the demand makes the fuel gas drum or the gas vessels exceed its capacity, and leads to the fuel gas emission in the flares (as shown in Fig. 2 ), which means an economic loss for the refinery and pollution to the environment. On the other hand, the shortage of fuel gas brings mechanical trouble to the fuel gas drum and makes an unstable production process unless some expensive gas fuel, such as natural gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), is input into the HP gas vessels, which causes an increase in the operation cost. These unbalances can be compensated by optimizing the scheduling of the fuel gas system.

The fuel gas, together with the fuel oil, is consumed by the boilers and heaters to produce various utilities needed by the refinery. As shown in Fig. 3 (Zhang and Rong, 2008 ), the energy system of a refinery can be mainly divided into three parts: fuel gas system, cogeneration system and production system. Boilers in the cogeneration systems consume fuel gas and fuel oil, and generate steam at high pressure level to satisfy part of the steam needs of the production system and drive the steam turbines to produce electricity. Higher electricity production capacity than the needs will make it possible to export electricity to the outside grid for profit, or the refinery needs to purchase it from the outside electricity grid. The heat demand is satisfied by the combustion of fuel gas and fuel oil in the fired heaters. Since fuel gas contributes most of the primary energy source to the energy needs of a refinery, and can be converted to other forms of energy, such as steam, electricity and heat, it is reasonable to consider it as the key energy source, while the fuel oil and electricity as the secondary one. Apparently, operation of the boilers and the heaters with fuel gas only, without using any fuel oil, is most economical, because fuel gas cannot be sold in the market, while fuel oil can bring great profit to the refinery. However, the fuel gas is always insufficient for the production needs. This requires the use of fuel oil and incurs additional fuel cost. In addition, each boiler and heater has different characteristics, such as capacity, efficiency and available fuel types, and they are required to work as stably as possible to avoid economic loss during the energy source change. Therefore, the optimal scheduling of the fuel gas system needs to satisfy the following conditions: (1) the amount of fuel gas in fuel gas drum and HP fuel gas (2) minimum deviation from the normal capacity of fuel gas (3) minimum amount of fuel oil consumption; (4) maximization of electricity production; (5) maximization of stability of the boilers and heaters operation,
It should be noticed that there are some imprecise natures in fuel gas system because some information is incomplete or unavailable, such as the production rate of fuel gas, the energy demand of the equipments and the cost coefficient in the objective function. As a result, the deterministic optimization method which requires well-defined and precise data cannot be competent for the fuel gas scheduling problem. In this study, FPP method is used to deal with these imprecise natures. 3. Fuzzy possibilistic model for fuel gas scheduling
According to the above analysis, a fuzzy possibilistic model is proposed to tackle the optimal scheduling problem of fuel gas system in refinery. In general, penalty costs for fuel gas emission, fuel gas shortage and fuel gas capacity deviation are always estimated by decision makers. Furthermore, fuel gas generation and energy demands for the equipment are determined by forecasting which is usually inaccurate. These imprecise natures are defined as fuzzy numbers which can be characterized by possibility distributions.
 Cogeneration system Fuel gas system 3.1. Objective function
The objective of the optimization is to reach the minimum total operation cost of the energy system given the prediction of fuel gas production and energy demand. The optimization takes the penalty costs and the energy source costs into account. The penalty costs consist of the penalty for fuel gas emission, fuel gas shortage and fuel gas capacity deviation, and the penalty for energy source change in the boilers and heaters, while the energy source costs are composed of fuel oil cost, electricity cost and boiler feed water cost. Consequently, the objective function is given by: Min C  X 
Fuel gas amount must be maintained at normal condition to prevent fuel gas emission and shortage. These improper phenom-ena need to be avoided because they will bring large economic loss to the refinery. If some abnormal condition of fuel gas amount occurs, a penalty cost will be imposed. The first term of the objective function is the penalty cost for fuel gas shortage when the fuel gas amount is smaller than the lower bound. The second term is the penalty for fuel gas emission when the fuel gas amount exceeds the upper bound. The third and the fourth term are the penalties when the fuel gas amount is below and above the normal capacity respectively. The fifth term is the conversion cost of LP to HP gas, which includes the operation cost of compressor and desulphurization units. Because the supply of fuel gas is always less than the demand amount, the refinery has to make up for the deficiency by fuel oil consumption. The sixth term and heaters. The seventh tem is the cost of water fed into the boilers to produce high pressure steam. The eighth term is the profit from the sales of surplus electricity generated by the turbines in cogeneration system. Finally, stable energy source usage of boilers and heaters is preferable during the production process, so the last two terms of the objective function are imposed as a penalty when the energy source change happens to some unit between two scheduling periods.

Possibility distributions in existing fuzzy set fields can be divided into several patterns, for example interval, triangular, trapezoid, bell-shaped, exponential and hyperbolic. Among the various types of possibility distributions, the triangular distribu-tion is used most often for representing imprecise data for solving possibilistic mathematical problems due to its simplicity and flexibility, though other patterns may be preferable in some applications ( Liang, 2007a ). In this study, it is assumed that the penalty costs for fuel gas emission, fuel gas shortage and fuel gas capacity deviation are restricted by triangular fuzzy numbers ~ o represent the most possible, most pessimistic and most optimistic values of corresponding fuzzy number respectively. Consequently, the total operation cost of the energy system can also be restricted by a triangular fuzzy number ( Inuiguchi and Ram X   X  k, 2000 ). 3.2. Constraints 3.2.1. Material balance for fuel gas system
Compared with the previous research work ( Frangopoulos et al., 1996), this study considers the storage ability of fuel gas system. As mentioned in Chapter 2, the fuel gas system in refinery is composed of LP and HP fuel gas. Correspondingly, the material balance can also be divided into two parts, the material balance for LP fuel gas drum and the one for HP fuel gas vessels.
The material balance for LP fuel gas drum is represented by Eq. (2) where V LG,t is the amount of fuel gas in the drum at time t .
Almost all of the processes in refinery generate LP gas, and because of the high percentage of sulfide, no LP gas is allowed to be burned directly. Actually, all of the LP gas will be sent to the fuel gas drum and compressed to higher pressure to adjust the of the amount of fuel gas at time t 1 and the difference between the generation and conversion amount of LP fuel gas during the scheduling period.
 V
Similarly, the material balance for HP fuel gas vessels can be
This is because the HP fuel gas vessels receive the compressed gas from LP fuel gas drum which can be regarded as a producer of HP fuel gas. HP fuel gas is consumed by all the boilers and heaters in refinery, as illustrated in Eq. (4).

This kind of constraint can also be divided into two parts, the capacity constraint of LP fuel gas drum and the one of HP fuel gas vessels. They have the same formats. The amount of fuel gas should be limited in the permitted capacity. However, the emission and the shortage of fuel gas will occur in some emergent define the emission amount and shortage amount of fuel gas respectively so that the emergent condition is included in the of fuel gas from the normal capacity. The slack variables D V  X  and D V FG ; t mean the increase and decrease amount from the normal capacity respectively.

V 3.2.3. Material balance and energy balance for utility equipments
It is assumed that the boiler feed water consumed by the boilers is totally converted into high pressure steam without any waste, as given by Eq. (7), and all the steam produced by boilers can be sent to all turbines and production system, as specified by
Eq. (8). Each boiler has different constant efficiency. Furthermore, the heating value of fuel gas and fuel oil and the enthalpy of steam and water is considered as constant. Thus, the energy balance constraint of boiler can be formulated by Eq. (9) as a linear function.
 F F X
Turbines receive the high pressure steam from boilers to generate electricity. At the same time, they extract low-pressure steam and condensing water. Therefore, the material balance for turbines can be indicated as Eqs. (10) and (11). Similar with Eq. (9), the energy model can also be illustrated as linear function by assuming the constant efficiency, heating value and enthalpy, as shown in Eq. (12).
 F F E
In heaters, fuel gas and fuel oil is combusted to generate heat energy demanded by process units. Eq. (13) is specific to the energy balance for heaters. It is also a linear function because of the assumption of constant efficiency and heating value. E  X  Z k H 3.2.4. Operation constraints of equipments consumption in boilers and at the same time impose lower and upper bounds on some variables to translate the nonlinear optimization problem to MILP problem. Consequently, lower and upper bounds on the flow rate of generated steam, fuel gas and fuel oil can be enforced by Eqs. (14) X (16), while logical conditions in Eqs. (17) X (20) specify that the binary variables y boiler i at time t and 0 if there is no change.
 F b y y y y
Similarly, the operation constraints of heaters are defined as follows: b y y y y
Turbines and compressors also have their own operation ranges for stable operation. Their flow rate constraints are illustrated by Eqs. (27) and (28) respectively.
 F F 3.2.5. Energy demand satisfaction constraints
The generated steam from boilers and turbines, electricity from turbines and heat from heaters at each period has to satisfy the energy demand of production system. These constraints are given by Eqs. (29) X (32).
 X X X E
It is assumed that these energy demands are also determined ~ F 3.3. Defuzzified model
Unlike a crisp model, objective and constraints in the fuzzy possibilistic model cannot be determined uniquely since the coefficients in the model are imprecise. In order to make them clear, these fuzzy formulations should be transformed to usual mathematical formulation by managing the coefficients with a imprecise inequality constraints into crisp ones using the fuzzy ranking concept. Lai and Hwang (1992) provided the weighted average of the most possible, pessimistic and optimistic value of the imprecise coefficients and then substituted this average into the problem. Fang et al. (1999) adopted the concept of a -preference to reduce the fuzzy possibilistic problem to a semi-infinite programming problem. In this work, definition of possibility and necessity measures are proposed to interpret the imprecise objective function, and a -level method is used to deal with the imprecise constraints. 3.3.1. Imprecise objective function
Let b be a fuzzy variable, and let g be a crisp variable. The possibility and necessity measures of the event that b r g occurs are defined as follows ( Inuiguchi and Ram X   X  k, 2000 ): Pos  X  b r g  X  X  sup f m A  X  r  X  9 r r g g X  33  X  Nes  X  b r g  X  X  1 sup f m A  X  r  X  9 r 4 g g X  34  X  where m A is the possibility distribution of the fuzzy variable b . Pos ( b r g ) and Nes ( b r g ) show the possibility and certainty degrees to what extent b is not greater than g . Those indices are depicted in Fig. 4 . According to Fig. 4 , certainty degree measure Nes  X  ~ A r g  X  Z y can be transformed into crisp format m  X  y  X  o m  X  r g , where m and o represent the most possible value and the most optimistic value of imprecise parameter ~ A respectively.

Assume that the schedulers expect to obtain the optimal cost with high certainty by this model. Then, the objective function should be satisfied with a given certainty. It is easy to understand
Given the certainty degree as y , the objective function can be treated as follows:
Minimize c s : t : Nes  X  C r c  X  Z y  X  35  X  where c is the minimal value which makes the necessity measure of the event that C r c occurs larger than or equal to y . Eq. (35) uses the strategy of minimizing the total operation cost of the energy system with a high certainty degree.

For convenience, let C det denote the determined part of the objective function.

C  X   X  Then, Eq. (35) can be rewritten as follows:
Minimize c s : t :  X   X   X  Moreover, Eq. (36) is equivalent to: Minimize
X  X   X  y  X  3.3.2. Imprecise constraints
In the a -level method, the possibility level of a fuzzy number in the constraints is limited to be not smaller than a (0 r a r 1), which can be interpreted as follows:  X  g  X  Z a  X  38  X  where m A is the possibility distribution of the fuzzy variable b . value of b equals g should be greater than or equal to a . Thus, the in the r -coordinate in Fig. 5 .

With this interpretation, Eqs. (2), (3) and (29) X (32) can be defuzzified as follows:
F
Membership value 0 1
Membership value 0 1
Membership value 0 1 F F r F r E r E
After the defuzzifying procedure described above, the fuzzy possibilistic model in the last section is transformed into crisp mathematical model which can be solved by usual solver. Generally, a , together with certainty degree y in the last section, are defined by the schedulers according to their experiences. y and a can be called satisfaction level which reflect the certainty degree to what extent the objective value is satisfied and the level of possibility of meeting the fuel gas balance constraints and the demand constraints. Performance evaluation of these satisfaction levels should be executed to present their effect to the optimal result should be investigated. 4. Sensitivity analysis of the fuzzy possibilistic model 4.1. Case interpretation
To give the sensitivity analysis, a case study is performed by using the energy system model of a simple refinery process (CDU), one fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), one reformer, one hydrogenator, one coker, one MTBE, one gas plant, one polymer-ization, one alkylation and the blending process. The network of are three boilers and three turbines in the cogeneration system and five heaters in production system corresponding to five different processes respectively, which are CDU, FCC, reformer, hydrogenator and coker. The production system supplies fuel gas and fuel oil to the cogeneration system to generate high pressure steam (3.5 MPa), medium pressure steam (1.0 MPa) and electricity which is sent back to the production system. In particular, it is assumed that all the boilers and heaters cannot use LP gas as fuel. Furthermore, only the boilers and heater for CDU, i.e. heater1 (H1), can consume both HP gas and fuel oil, while other ones only consume HP gas.

The optimal scheduling model for the fuel gas system developed in the previous character is applied to this example. The scheduling horizon is composed of six periods, and each period is 1 h. Table 1 shows the capacity bound of the fuel gas system. Table 2 shows the efficiency of boilers, turbines and heaters in the energy system. Table 3 shows the consumption ranges for fuel gas and fuel oil of the boilers and heaters. Table 4 shows the operation ranges of the boilers and turbines, namely the lower and upper bounds of steam flow rate generated by the boilers and consumed by the turbines. Heating value of the fuel gas and enthalpy of the steam is shown in Tables 5 X 7 show the unit cost of some utilities referred in the model. The unit conversion cost of LP to HP gas is assumed to be 3.5 yuan/Nm
Table 8 shows the penalty value for objective function. It illustrates that the penalty costs for fuel gas emission, fuel gas shortage and fuel gas capacity deviation are restricted by triangular fuzzy numbers . Figs. 7 and 8 show the most possible values of steam demand, electricity demand and heat demand of 200 190 180 170 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 40
Heat demand (KMJ) 80 70 60 50 40 30 20
Steam demand (t/h) production system during the scheduling horizon. As presented in the last section, the values of these predicted demands are fuzzy numbers. The triangular possibility distributions of the 7 distribution coefficients which are arbitrary numbers between 0 flow rate generated in production system, and similar with the demands, possibility distributions of the fuel gas flow rate are
HG are arbitrary numbers between 0 and 0.5. At last, it is assumed that the initial capacity of fuel gas drum and HP gas vessels is 11,000 and 4500 Nm 3 , and all the boilers and heaters consume fuel gas only at time 0. 4.2. Sensitivity analysis
It is important to perform sensitivity analysis to identify the sensitive parameters. The sensitive parameters are the para-meters that need to be estimated with special care to minimize the risk of obtaining an erroneous optimal solution. Hsieh and Wu (2000) and Tang et al. (2003) used the simulation based method to execute the sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the perfor-mance and effect of various imprecise parameters on the optimal result of the fuzzy model. However, substantive numerical experiments should be needed to re-execute the sensitivity analysis in order to obtain the right result once some of the parameters in the model are changed. To improve the flexibility, marginal value analysis method is proposed to give the sensitivity analysis.

Marginal value is the value that an additional unit of this flow has for the system. It is essential for project evaluations, process optimization, site-wide or plant-wide debottlenecking, product pricing as well as assisting business decisions. Hui (2000) has defined two marginal values: marginal profit (MP) and marginal cost (MC). MP, namely shadow price for resource in the corresponding constraint, is defined as the change in overall profit caused by a small variation in a stream flow (MP= D profit/ D change of a stream flow). The value of MP can be obtained by solving the model directly. It will not equal 0 only when the corresponding constrains are binding ones (constraints that hold with equality at the optimal solution). Otherwise, the decision will be generated without reaching the constrain boundary, and the MP value will be equal to 0. However, it does not mean that defined. MC is the variation in overall profit by adding or taking away a small amount of a stream (MC F , MC as feed= D profit/ D feed to a process stream; MC P , MC as product= D profit/ D product from a process stream). MC F and MC P represent the value and cost of the resource respectively. To calculate the value of MC MC P , dummy streams should be added artificially to the system. In this study, marginal values MP and MC F will be used to execute sensitivity analysis of imprecise natures in the fuel gas system. production
In this part, satisfaction level y and a are set to be 0.8, and the the effect of possibility distributions to the optimal result, this work first uses the simulation based method which lets g B , g LG and g HG to vary from 0 to 0.5 in the increment of 0.05 respectively. Altogether 10 fuzzy numbers are considered in this model. The experiment result is tabulated in Table 10 . It can be found that some of the decision values are changed linearly with the increasing of the value of g , which causes the objective value to decrease linearly. Furthermore, MP values of these variables can be generated by solving the defuzzified MILP model. Using the MP values, the effect of possibility distributions to the objective value can be derived directly instead of simulation experiment step by step. For example, change amount of objective value induced by change of g B can be calculated as follows: D C where a B is the satisfaction level of high pressure steam demand. variable F Dstm ; B ; t and C is the optimal result when possibility distribution coefficient g B is increased or decreased by D g sensitivity value of g B can be generated like Eq. (46).  X  D C g B = D g B  X 
Compared with the simulation based method, marginal value analysis based sensitivity analysis is much more flexible because MP values can be obtained by solving the model directly.
Substantive numerical experiments will be omitted when sensi-tivity analysis is re-executed.

Larger absolute value of sensitivity value means that larger deviation from the optimal status will happen if possibility distribution of the corresponding variable is not correct. To reduce value is asked to be predicted as precisely as possible, so that the range of the possibility distribution can become as small as possible. Thus, the possibility of obtaining large D g will be reduced significantly. It is noticed that the production amount of to 49,500, in this study. As a result, it is recommended to improve the precision of the prediction of HP gas production.
To illustrate the effectiveness of the suggestion, it is assumed that the only imprecise nature of the system is the prediction of HP gas production with the most possible value as shown in
Table 9 . Firstly, numerical experiments are performed by using the production forecast error of 10% so that the possibility parameters are set to be the most possible values shown in
Tables 8 and 9 , Figs.7 and 8 . This fuzzy model is solved by using the defuzzified method referred in the last section, and optimal periods is (14,000, 14,000, 14000, 16,500, 16,500, 16,500). A crisp
MILP model will be obtained by substituting the imprecise values of HP gas production with the true ones. Optimal result derived from the crisp model is listed in column  X  X  X risp model1 X  X  in
Table 11 . To characterize the contribution of improving the precision of the prediction of HP gas production, reliability of scheduling decision derived from the fuzzy model is defined as below: z  X  1  X  C det C fuz  X  = C det  X  47  X 
Where z represents the reliability of scheduling decision. C
C is the objective value generated from the crisp model and the fuzzy model respectively. Reliability of scheduling decision can be determined as 98.17% when production forecast error of HP gas is 10%. Then, improve the precision of the prediction of HP gas true value of HP gas production in 6 scheduling periods is (14,500, 14,500, 14500, 17,200, 17,200, 17,200), while possibility distribution coefficient g HG can be set to be 0.05. Optimal results generated from the crisp MILP model and the proposed fuzzy model ( a HG is set to be 0.8) are listed in column  X  X  X risp model2 X  X  can be calculated like Eq. (47) to be 99.01%, which is improved by 0.84% compared with the one when production forecast error of HP gas is 10%.

On the other hand, LP gas production prediction is assumed to be the only imprecise nature of the system. Same numerical experiment procedure is implemented. The most possible value of
LP gas production is shown in Table 9 , and true value of other parameters are set to be the most possible values shown in also reduced from 10% to 5% as true value of LP gas production in 6 scheduling periods is changed from (1200, 1200, 1200, 1450, 1450, 1450) to (1250, 1250, 1250, 1550, 1550, 1550). Optimal with different LP gas production forecast precision is listed in Table 12 . It is shown that reliability of scheduling decision is improved by 0.3%, namely from 99.39% to 99.69%, due to the advancement of LP gas production forecast prediction.
From the numerical experiment, it can be found that the effect of improving reliability of scheduling decision by enhancing HP gas production forecast prediction is much better than enhancing LP gas production forecast prediction. By the same experiments, it can be further demonstrated that enhancing HP gas production forecast prediction, among all the imprecise parameters, is the most effective measure to improve the reliability of scheduling decision. The suggestion concluded from the sensitivity analysis of possibility distributions of demands and production is justified. 4.2.2. Sensitivity analysis of satisfaction level
To give the effect of satisfaction level to the optimal result, all of g are set to be 0.05, and satisfaction level y and a are varied from 0.5 to 1 in the increment of 0.1 respectively. The experiment some of the decision values are also changed linearly with the increasing of the value of a , which causes the objective value to increase linearly. From these numerical results, it can be concluded that the change of satisfaction level a does not affect the optimal result as significantly as that of possibility distributions of corresponding fuzzy numbers in this case. Moreover, to intuitively tell schedulers how satisfaction level a will affect the result, D change of objective value caused by D change of a should also be derived by MP values. Take the demand of steam from boilers for example, change amount of objective value induced by change of a B is shown in Eq. (48).
 D C amount of variable F Dstm ; B ; t and C in the optimal result when satisfaction level a B is increased or decreased by D a B sensitivity value of a B can be generated like Eq. (49).  X  D C a B = D a B  X  Absolute value of m a B determines the sensitivity value of a noticed that satisfaction level of the HP gas a HG has the largest sensitivity value, which is equal to 12,375, in this study. As a result, it is recommended that a HG should be monitored particularly closely as the optimal scheduling is implemented. Furthermore, in this experiment, it is found from Table 13 that the decision values have no change even though objective value increases linearly with the increasing of the value of y . This finding indicates that in this case different choose of certainty degree y does not affect the scheduling decision from the fuzzy possibilistic model when it is varied from 0.5 to 1. 4.2.3. Sensitivity analysis of possibility distributions of cost coefficients
In this section, the influence of imprecise cost coefficients in the objective function will be investigated. All of g are set to be 0.05, and satisfaction level y and a are set to be 0.8. MC HP gas from the LP gas drum is used to interpret the effect of imprecise cost coefficients. To generate these MC F value, dummy streams are added into the fuel gas system to form a new model, as shown in Fig. 9 .

In this case study, unit conversion cost C LP2HP is set to be 3.5 initially, and compressor will work at its maximum load as shown in the optimal result. However, it is found that when the conversion cost is increased because of some factors (e.g. increasing of electricity cost), the operation decision of compres-sor will be changed consequently. Assuming that the range of C
LP2HP is constrained within the interval of (0, 20), result of capacity of LP gas drum with different C LP2HP is illustrated in Fig. 10 .

Result also shows that MC F value of HP gas from the LP gas drum is 2.5 in the whole scheduling horizon, which indicates that the unit value of this HP gas is 2.5 yuan/Nm 3 . On the other hand, unit cost of this HP gas in this case can be calculated as: C
According to the second term of Eq. (50), the penalty of deviation from normal capacity will be decreased by 3+0.8 n (4 3)=3.8 yuan when 1 Nm 3 LP gas is converted to HP gas, and if there is fuel gas emission in the flares, the excess penalty for LP gas from permitted capacity will be decreased by 10+0.8 n (12 10)=11.6 yuan when 1 Nm 3 LP gas is converted to HP gas.

When C LP2HP is within the interval of (0, 6.3), since no emission happens, last term of Eq. (50) equals 0. Thus, unit cost of HP gas from LG gas drum can be calculated as C HP = C LP2HP 3.8 0 which is always less than its MC F value 2.5. This means that the more LP Compressor is asked to work in full load 1400 Nm 3 /h. When C value if there is no LP gas emission. At that moment, the refinery would rather increase the capacity of LP drum to suffer the deviation penalty than convert LP gas to HP gas. As a result, load of compressor is reduced to 613 Nm 3 /h in the last scheduling period, which causes larger fuel gas drum capacity as shown in Fig. 10 . At last, when the unit conversion cost is more than 17.9, C = C LP2HP 3.8 11.6 which will always be larger than the MC value even though the emission penalty is imposed. Then, emitting some LP gas in the flares will decrease the operation cost. Consequently, compressor is stopped in the last scheduling period, and 613 Nm 3 LP gas is emitted in the flares.
From above analysis, it is easy to find that the possibility distribution of cost coefficients will influence the scheduling decision. For example, if possibility distribution of penalty for deviation of LP gas form normal capacity is changed from (3, 2, 4) to be (3, 2.375, 3.625), three decision intervals of the compressor mentioned above will be changed to be (0, 6), (6, 17.6) and (17.6,
LP gas form normal capacity and excess penalty for LP gas from permitted capacity is changed to be  X  3 ; 3 D C D GD ; 3  X  D C changed to be  X  0 ; 5 : 5  X  D C D GD y ;  X  5 : 5  X  D C D GD does not affect the scheduling decision from the fuzzy possibilistic model when it is varied from 0.5 to 1. However, it is illustrated in this analysis that certainty degree y will definitely influence decision intervals of the compressor. 5. Conclusion
The purpose of the paper is to propose a fuzzy possibilistic model for optimal fuel gas system scheduling in refinery complex and a flexible sensitivity analysis method for the imprecise parameters in this fuzzy possibilistic model. In this work, imprecise natures in the system, such as prediction of production rate of fuel gas, prediction of energy demand of the equipments and the cost coefficient in the objective function, are defined as fuzzy numbers which are characterized by triangular possibility distributions. The fuzzy possibilistic model is defuzzified by the definition of necessity measure and the a -level method. In order to illustrate the effects of the imprecise natures intuitively, this work implements sensitivity analysis of various imprecise para-meters by using the marginal value analysis method. Compared with the simulation based method, marginal value analysis based sensitivity analysis is much more flexible so that no substantive numerical experiments will be needed during the analysis procedure . Some suggestions are also made by the analysis to assist the engineering operation in real refinery. The proposed analysis method can also be used in other scheduling model.
Further research needs to be conducted liking into producing fuzzy possibilistic model by imprecise parameters with nonlinear possibility distribution. Also, developing corresponding sensitivity analysis method is another important future project.
