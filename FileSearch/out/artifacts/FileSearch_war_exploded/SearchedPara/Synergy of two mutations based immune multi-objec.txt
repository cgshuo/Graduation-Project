Optimization based automatic clustering algorithms greatly rely on a validity function (optimization criterion) whose optima appear as proxies for the unknown  X  X orrect classification X  in a previously unhandled dataset [ 13 ]. Most existing clustering methods, however, attempt to optimize just one such clustering criterion modeled by a single cluster validity index [ 10 , 22 ]. An improper choice of the validity measure may lead to poor clustering results. In this situation, it is necessary to simultaneously optimize several validity measures which can capture the different data characteristics [ 17 ].

Determining the appropriate number of clusters for a given data set is an important con-sideration in clustering. For this purpose, the researchers increasingly paid attention to auto-matic clustering algorithms recently. Although many works have been focused on single-been undertaken so far on the application of evolutionary multi-objective optimization algo-rithms (EMOA) for automatic clustering. In [ 14 ], multi-objective clustering with automatic k -determination (MOCK) was developed, in which two evaluation criteria (one based on the total compactness of the partitioning and another based on the connectedness of the clusters) are optimized simultaneously. An important drawback of MOCK is its encoding, the length of each chromosome is equal to the number of points presented in the data set. Hence the length of each chromosome will increase largely with increasing in the number of points. In [ 16 ], Kundu et al. applied the differential evolution (DE) and genetic algorithm (GA) to the task of automatic fuzzy clustering by using a multi-objective optimization framework, where two conflicting fuzzy validity indices were simultaneously optimized including a well-known Euclidean distance based XB-index [ 32 ] and the Fuzzy C Means (FCM) measure Jm [ 2 ]. In [ 31 ], Saha et al. proposed a new multi-objective differential evolution based fuzzy clustering technique that encoded the cluster centers in its vectors and optimized multiple validity measures simultaneously.
 In this paper, a new immune multi-objective automatic fuzzy clustering algorithm, called STMIMAFC, is proposed. Two techniques are used to improve the performance of the pro-posed algorithm. On the one hand, in order to realize the effective local search for the number of clusters without any additional computing complexity, a synergy of two mutations is used to generate the new chromosomes. On the other hand, an exponential function based com-pactness validity index is used to balance the phenomenon where a single PBM validity [ 27 ] may be partial to select partitioning results which have a smaller number of clusters than reality. Performance of the proposed algorithm is extensively compared with three multi-objective automatic fuzzy clustering methods in terms of Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) [ 12 ], Minkowski score (MS) [ 3 ] and the optimal number of clusters. Moreover, STMIMAFC is applied to a real application, namely image segmentation problem.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Sect. 2 , some related theoretical backgrounds are presented. Thereafter, the procedure of the proposed algorithm is described in Sect. 3 . Section 4 presents and discusses the experimental results of clustering over data sets and a real application of the proposed algorithm to image segmentation is presented in Sect. 5 . Finally, Sect. 6 concludes this paper with some discussions on relevant future work. 2 Theoretical background 2.1 Multi-objective clustering We consider the clustering task as a multi-objective optimization problem, which seeks to minimize a vector of functions, 1 , 2 ,..., m is a set of criterion functions.
Considering a maximization problem for each objective, it is said that a decision vector x
A  X  dominates another vector x B  X  (written as x A x B ) if and only if: Usually, no single best solution for this optimization task exists, but the framework of Pareto-optimality is embraced. Then the Pareto-optimal set is defined as 2.2 Immune clonal algorithm Currently, artificial immune system (AIS) has received increasing attention of researchers and industrial sponsors. Like evolutionary algorithms, AIS makes use of the mechanism of vertebrate immune system to construct new intelligent algorithms and provides some new this paper, a new immune multi-objective automatic fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed for the task of automatically evolving the number of clusters as well as a proper partitioning of data sets. In this section, we will give a simple introduction of immune clone algorithm which will be employed in the proposed algorithm.

In 1958, Burnet et al. [ 1 ] put forward the famous immune clonal selection theory. Inspired by the Clonal Selection theory, De Castro et al. [ 4 ] proposed a kind of Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA). CSA is a new method of artificial immune system. Liu et al. [ 18 ] introduced an antibody immunodominance operator to the framework of CSA, which can make use of the prior knowledge which is accumulated in the process of searching clustering center and quicken convergence rate. Du et al. [ 6 ] proposed a new immune clonal algorithm, which include three operations: clonal proliferation operation, clonal mutation operation and clonal denoted as: 2.2.1 Clonal proliferation operation In immunology, clone means asexual propagation, so that a group of identical cells can be descended from a single ancestor. The clonal proliferation operator is implemented as: q is the cloning number assigned to active antibody a i , q i is calculated as follows: where n C is clonal size of antibody population, and f i denotes the affinity value of active antibody a i . Note that, the clone population size is sometimes greater than the expectant value N c because of the ceil function. In this paper, we just perform the clonal proliferation operation on the dominant antibodies other than the whole antibody population, which is introduced in the process of proposed algorithm. 2.2.2 Clonal mutation operation In immunology, clonal mutation is the main mechanism of the immune system recognizing external pattern in the form of antibody gene mutation and compilation so as to gain higher affinity. Inspired by immune response process, the clonal mutation operator explores local areas around antibodies by introducing blind perturbation. The clonal mutation operation M is defined as:
A ( t ) = M ( A ( t ))
In immunology, hypermutation is often used as clonal mutation operation. For real number coding, hypermutation can use uniform variation, Gaussian variation, Cauchy variation and the consistency variation to get new individuals. In this paper, we designed a new mutation strategy which is special for the structure of antibody, which will be given in Sect. 3.2 . 2.2.3 Clonal selection operation Clonal selection operation is a variation process of selecting outstanding antibodies from antibody population after clonal mutation operation. It can be defined as follows:
A ( t ) = S ( A ( t )) 3 The proposed algorithm In this section, the principle of synergy of two mutation based immune multi-objective automatic fuzzy clustering algorithm (STMIMAFC) will been discussed. 3.1 Chromosome representation and initial population The real-coding antibody with fixed length described in automatic clustering using modified differential evolution (ACDE) [ 8 ] is used in our proposed algorithm. For a user-specified maximum number of clusters K max , the length of a chromosome is K max + K max  X  d .The first K max entries are positive numbers in [ 0 , 1 ] which control whether the corresponding cluster is to be activated or not. The remaining entries are reserved for K max cluster centers. The chromosomes can be expressed in Fig. 1 .

If T i , k &gt; 0 . 5, the k th clustering center in the chromosome is activated or selected for partitioning the associated data set. On the other hand, the k th clustering center in the chro-
In this paper, antibody a i is encoded as follows: 3.2 Synergy of two mutation operators As introduced in Sect. 3.1 , it includes two parts in the antibody encoding, namely the activa-tion thresholds and clustering centers. Accordingly, we proposed a new mutation called as the synergy of two mutation operators in this work. In the proposed synergy of two mutation operators, two new different mutation operators for the activation thresholds and clustering centers respectively are designed according to the structure of antibodies. Namely, the acti-vation thresholds can evolve themselves separately by using a special mutation strategy. The reason why we employ the synergy of two mutations will be presented in Sect. 4.4 in details. 3.2.1 Mutation strategy of activation thresholds in antibody a i ( t ) , randomly select M genes to perform a new mutation. M and the new mutation can be described as follows: where, rand ( 0 , 1 ) is a random uniform number between [0, 1]. randI represents the indexes of M random genes of activation thresholds, and j  X  randI .FromEqs.( 11 )and( 12 )we can see, after above mutation operator, the number of activation thresholds which are greater than 0.5 become more or less, so the number of the activated (or active) cluster centers in the antibody a i will change meanwhile. Therefore, this mutation achieves local search about the number of the activated cluster centers.

Suppose K max = 5 and the antibody is encoded as Fig. 3 a. If rand ( 0 , 1 ) = 0 . 01 , M = rand ( 0 , 1 )  X  K max = 1 , namely one gene bit of activation thresholds is selected to be mutated, the first inactive gene bit (0.4) in activation thresholds is selected to be mutated thus the corresponding clustering centers are unchanged.

If M = rand ( 0 , 1 )  X  K max = 0 . 8  X  5 = 4, rand ( 0 , 1 ) = 0 . 8, then the third gene bit of activation thresholds is mutated, namely T i , randI ( 1 ) = 0 . 56 and the corresponding added as shown in Fig. 4 b.

For the third active genetic bit (0.7) in the activation thresholds, after the mutation of activation thresholds designed in the paper, it will be active or inactive, as shown in Fig. 5 b, c.
From these examples given above, we can see that such a mutation of the activation thresh-olds can enlarge the local search ability and increase probability of searching appropriate number of the cluster for the given data set. 3.2.2 Mutation strategy of cluster centers For the cluster centers which are latter part of antibody encoding, we proposed an improved differential mutation to generate new cluster centers for antibody a i . Assume that the genes cluster centers of the whole antibody population can be described as { X 1 , X 2 ,..., X n } , n is the size of antibody population. When generating new cluster centers, a hybrid selection mechanism is used, which include selection 1 and selection 2. In Fig. 6 , the antibodies in the dominant population are less-crowded antibodies selected from non-dominated population. In the early stage of evolution, selection 1 is used, when the current generation is larger than a pre-defined number, the selection 2 is active. In two selection strategies, we choose the base parent cluster center X r 1 from the clone population randomly. While the methods of selecting other two parents cluster centers X r 2 and X r 3 are different in two selection strategies. In selection 1, they are selected from non-dominated population randomly, and in selection 2, they are randomly selected from clone population. The process is presented as follows: where, gen is the current generation, t max is given maximum generations,  X  is a selection parameter to regulate the selection pressure. The improved differential mutation has two advantages: (i) It can guarantee the quality of the best solutions found because the base cluster center X r 1 is selected from clone population in which the antibodies are less-crowded non-dominated; (ii) Because we do not use those antibodies in clone population to generate difference vector at the beginning of evolutionary process, it can ensure the diversity of population and avoid misleading into local optimal by the inefficient antibodies from clone population. 3.3 Selecting the objective functions Performance of the multi-objective clustering highly depends on the choice of objective functions which should be as contradictory as possible. In this paper, we used PBM proposed by Pakhira et al. [ 27 ] as one cluster validity index. PBM is defined as follows: where k is the number of clusters and u j is the cluster membership of j th point in the i th cluster , and m denotes the fuzzy exponent.

When the partitioning is compact and good, the maximum value of the PBM index means the optimal number of clusters in a data set. In the process of experiment, we find that an automatic clustering technique optimizing a single PBM validity index objective may often be partial to select partitioning results which have smaller number of clusters than reality. Figure 7 describes this phenomenon. From Fig. 7 we can see, for data with 16 clusters, PBM validity index based single objective automatic clustering algorithm divides the data set only into four clusters.

The above phenomenon is easy to be explained. In Eq. 14 , E k and D k denote the intra cluster distance and the inter cluster distance respectively. In automatic clustering algorithm, the number of clusters k is unknown, when the proportion between E k and D k of two partitioning results is approximate, maximizing PBM index will inevitably lead to select the partitioning results which have smaller number of clusters. Thus the intra cluster distance is greater than the truth. Therefore, it needs to minimize another validity index which can measure the intra cluster compactness, to balance the shortage of PBM index in the automatic clustering algorithm.
 The traditional compactness validity index can be usually expressed as follows:
As Pal and Bezdek [ 26 ] and Kwon [ 15 ] pointed out, these methods show a monotonic decreasing tendency when c approaches the number of data points n , because lim  X   X  n x j  X  c i 2 = 0. Thus, the traditional index loses their ability to validate ( U , V ) for large values of k .

Furthermore, the traditional compactness validity index [ 15 ] also suffers from the follow-ing shortcoming in Fig. 8 . This figure shows two different fuzzy partitions Fm  X  ( U , V ) and Fn  X  ( U , V ) , the centers of Fm and Fn are c m and c n respectively, and each fuzzy cluster has eight data points. Intuitively, it is well known that Fn is more compact than Fm .How-two clusters. The compactness has two parts,  X  ij and x j  X  c i , and a smaller compactness value represents better partitioning results. We find that the two components act against each other in the present case. In the partition Fm , each x mj is far from c m , which results in a lower degree of u mj and a higher value of x mj  X  c m . Conversely, because x nj is close to c , there is a higher degree of membership u nj and a lower value of x nj  X  c n . Thus, in spite of the smaller value of Euclidean distance x nj  X  c n , it does not recognize that Fn is more compact than Fm .

Therefore it is necessary to design a new compactness validity index. We now propose an exponential compactness validity index, it can be expressed as follows: where The advantages of the exponential function have been known in cluster analysis [ 24 ]. Especially, Wu and Yang [ 28 ] had claimed that an exponential-type distance gives robust property. Moreover, we consider it is relative to  X  T of the total average distance measure for all clusters. In this paper, we choose 1 / PBM ( k ) and Comp exp as the two objectives to be optimized. Both 1 / PBM ( k ) and Comp exp indices are needed to be minimized in order to get good solutions. 3.4 Selection of the best solution Multi-objective optimization algorithms finally output a group of Pareto optimal solutions and all the solutions are equally important in terms of optimization objectives. But sometimes the user may want a specific clustering result. Therefore, how to select a single solution from the set of solutions become most important. Julia et al. [ 14 ] proposed statistical method to identify one or more promising clustering solutions in the candidate set, while the complexity of this method is too high. Saha et al. [ 30 ] developed a semi-supervised method of selecting a single solution from the set of solutions. In this paper, we didn X  X  do a further research on the method of selecting a single solution from Pareto optimal solutions, only selecting the solution with the highest clustering score as the best solution. 3.5 The flow of proposed immune multi-objective automatic fuzzy clustering algorithm The flow of proposed immune multi-objective automatic fuzzy cluttering algorithm (STMI-MAFC) is shown in Table 1 . 3.6 Complexity analysis is n c , the maximum generation is t max , the dimension of the dataset is d , calculating the time for the worst cases. The time complexity of calculating antibody affinity in step 2 is O ( n c dK max n log n ) for the worst cases, the time complexity required by synergy of two mutation operators is O ( dK max n c ) .
 The complexity of the proposed algorithm is: 4 STMIMAFC for data clustering In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed STMIMAFC, the performance of STMI-MAFC is compared with other three state-of-the-art multi-objective clustering techniques on 19 datasets. They are a synergy of genetic algorithm and multi-objective differential evo-lution (GADE) [ 16 ], multi-objective modified differential evolution based fuzzy clustering (MOMoDEFC) [ 31 ], multi-objective clustering with automatic k -determination (MOCK) [ 14 ].

For 19 data sets, since the benchmark data sets have their nominal partitions known to the user,wecomparedthreealgorithmswithfourmajorissues:(1)theMinkowskiScorevalue[ 3 ]; (2) the Adjusted Rand index value [ 12 ]; (3) the optimal number of clusters obtained; (4) the computational time required to find the solution. Finally, a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-of the proposed algorithm (STMIMAFC) and other algorithms.
 The Minkowski scores [ 3 ] is a measure of the quality of a solution given the true clustering. Let T be the true solution and S the solution we wish to measure. n 11 denotes the number of pairs of elements that are in the same cluster in both T and S . n 01 denotes the number of pairs that are only in S ,and n 10 denotes the number of pairs that are in the same cluster only in T . Minkowski score (MS) is then defined as:
The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) [ 12 ] is also used to evaluate clustering results, which is a generalization of the rand index [ 28 ]. The adjusted rand index additionally introduces a statistically induced normalization in order to yield values close to 0 for random partitions. For a data set with n objects, the adjusted rand index is given by: where n lk denotes the number of data objects which are assigned to the cluster l and the partition. 4.1 Parametric setup and datasets In order to make a fair comparison, the sizes of population are set as 20 for GADE, MOMoD-EFC and MOCK. Other parameters are employed the values suggested in [ 14 , 16 , 31 ] and used directly without allowing any hand tuning. Table 2 presents the complete set of parameters used for GADE, MOMoDEFC, MOCK and STMIMAFC.

In GADE and STMIMAFC, the constant factor F and the crossover control parameter CR are self-adaptive adjusted, and they can be expressed as F = 0 . 5  X  ( 1 + rand ( 0 , 1 )), CR = (
CR max  X  CR min )  X  ( t max  X  gen )/ t max and CR max and CR min denote the upper bound and lower bound respectively. In STMIMAFC, n c is the size of antibody population, and n A is the size of dominant population. 19 data sets used in the experiments can be divided into two groups. The first group includes 10 UCI data sets; the second group has 9 artificial data sets with different structures as shown in Fig. 9 .Table 3 presents the details of these datasets. 4.2 Experimental results and analysis Figures 10 and 11 show the mean Minkowski scores, mean adjust rand index obtained by the four algorithms for 20 independent runs.
 From Fig. 10 , it is easy to see that the proposed algorithm obtains lowest mean Minkowski Score values on fourteen datasets among four state-of-the-art multi-objective automatic clus-tering algorithms. MOCK is in the second place and it has a lowest mean Minkowski Score values on data1, data5, data6 and synthetic3. GADE is worst in the view of Minkowski Score values. From Fig. 11 , we can get a similar conclusion that the proposed algorithm outper-forms other three multi-objective automatic clustering algorithms over most of data sets from the view of mean adjust rand index.

It is interesting that for some data sets covered here, the ARI value is a little mismatching closely with MS value, this is perhaps due to the fact that different validity indices judge the cohesiveness and separation between the clusters in different fashions (over the same dataset) [ 25 ]. Our proposed approach has the best performance among all the compared algorithms. It is noted that, the performance of MOCK on some artificial data sets remains better than other three multi-objective clustering algorithms in terms of the ARI and MS values.

Table 4 shows the means and standard deviations of the number of clusters for each competitor algorithm. The boldfaces mean the best results among four algorithms. From Table 4 , we can see that, MOCK is successful in finding the nearly correct number of classes for most of data sets. The performance of our approach is only second to MOCK.

Figure 12 presents the mean running time (in second) needed by the four clustering algo-rithms, it is easy to see that that our algorithm needs less running time than the compared algorithms in eleven out of nineteen cases. The performance of MOCK on run-time is second to our method.

From the above results we can see that, our proposed approach has the best performance in terms of the ARI index value and MS index value, MOCK is the second best algorithm.
In summary, these experimental results show the proposed algorithm outperforms other contestant three multi-objective clustering algorithms in terms of ARI and MS values for most test problems in this study. The proposed two improved strategies, namely; a synergy of two mutations and an improved compactness validity index can indeed help improve the performance of clustering algorithm. 4.3 Results of Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test to check whether there exists a statistically significant difference between the performance of the proposed algorithm (STMIMAFC) and other algorithms (denoted as Contender) on the MS results obtained by 20 runs according to Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test [ 7 , 11 ] with z = 0 . 05:
TheresultsareshowninTable 5 wherewereportthe p -valueofthestatisticaltest.Whenthe level of significance for a two-tailed non-directional test is 0.05, the corresponding critical p -value is 1.96. So if the absolute of result obtained is smaller than 1.96, we can get the conclusion that the hypothesis H 0 cannot be rejected, otherwise, the hypothesis H 1 is right and there is significant difference between them. The boldfaces in Table 5 mean the best results among four algorithms.
 For UCI datasets utilized in the study, we can see from Table 5 , the proposed algorithm STMIMAFC performs significantly better than other three algorithms on most of the testing problems. For New-thyroids and wine, results of obtained by comparing STMIMAFC with MOMoDEFC and MOCK cannot reject H 0 , that is to say there are no significant differences among them for the two datasets.

For Artificial datasets, the differences between STMIMAFC and GADE are significant with z = 0 . 05 on data1, data6, synthetic3, Square1 and Square4. The differences between STMIMAFC and MOMoDEFC are significant on most of testing problems except data1. And STMIMAFC and MOCK show a significant difference on data1, data6, synthetic3 and Square4.

The results of statistical tests confirm that STMIMAFC is the best one among all the algorithms for most of testing problems. 4.4 Validation of mutation strategy of activation thresholds In order to show why we design a special mutation for the activation thresholds in the indi-vidual coding, a simple comparison between modified differential evolution based automatic fuzzy clustering (MoDEAFC) [ 21 ]andACDE[ 8 ] will be first made and then narrow down to the aim of this work.

Automatic clustering using modified differential evolution is a kind of DE-based strategy ACDE has been introduced. ACDE uses a DE/rand/1 mutation strategy [ 29 ] as the classical DE, in which, two parameters F and CR are adaptively adjusted.
Modified differential evolution based automatic fuzzy clustering [ 21 ] is also a single objective based real-coded modified differential evolution for automatic fuzzy clustering which automatically evolves the number of clusters as well as the proper partitioning from a data set. First, the real-coded strategy used in MoDEAFC is very similar to that of ACDE and it will be introduced in details in the following content. Secondly, MoDEAFC adopts a mutation based modified differential evolution (MoDE), the modified variant of differential evolution differs from the classical differential evolution in the process of mutation, which uses three vectors: one is the local best, the second is the global best which is adaptive in nature, and the third one is selected randomly [ 21 ].

ACDE and MoDEAFC are very similar since both of them adopt an improved DE to realize automatic clustering. However, there is a significant difference in their performance when they are used to cluster eleven UCI datasets. Figure 14 shows the mean clustering accuracy and its standard deviation of 20 independent runs obtained by ACDE and MoDEAFC. It is easy to see that ACDE outperforms MoDEAFC on most of datasets. So it is necessary to dig out what lead to the phenomenon.
 By analyzing the two algorithms, we find that there are two differences for MoDEAFC and ACDE: (1) different improved DE mechanisms; (2) different coding strategies and updating strategies of activation thresholds. So from the view of DE mechanism, the performance of the modified differential evolution should be better than that of DE used in ACDE, which has been explained in [ 21 ]. So it can be concluded that the DE strategy is not a primary cause to explain why ACDE is better than MoDEAFC. So we turn our attention on another factor, namely their different coding strategies.

We simply introduce the encoding strategy in MoDEAFC. A chromosome is a real vector with the length of K max  X  d as shown:
A masker has K max entries of binary numbers 0 and 1, which indicates that the corre-given as: which means this chromosome will divide the input data into three classes.

As mentioned above, it is easy to see that the structures of chromosomes of the two algo-rithms are very similar. The main difference is the updating strategy of activation threshold. In ACDE, activation threshold T i , j is optimized by using DE, while Masker in MoDEAFC is just randomly generated in each generation. So, we conjecture whether the activation thresh-performance. In order to validate our hypothesis, we present experimental results of ACDE with different activation threshold updating strategies in Fig. 14 . ACDE-N randomly gener-ates activation thresholds in each generation, ACDE-T adopts our designed mutation strategy of activation thresholds.

From Fig. 14 , we can see that ACDE-T is better than other three algorithms on most of datasets. The analysis process inspires us to design a new mutation called as the synergy of two mutation operators, which has been presented in Sect. 3.2 . In the proposed synergy of two mutation operators, we designed two new different mutation operators for the activa-tion thresholds and clustering centers respectively according to the structure of antibodies. Namely, the activation thresholds can evolve themselves separately by using a special muta-tion strategy. The synergy of two mutation operators proposed in this work is introduced in details as follows. 4.5 The effect of parameter  X  in the mutation strategy of cluster centers Other parameters such as the size of clone population, the size of dominant population, the maximum number of generation, CR max and CR min are set as Sect. 4 .

To determine proper value of  X  in the proposed algorithm, a series of experiments have been conducted on Diabetes and Heart and 10 runs of STMIMAFC are preformed when  X  is set in different values varying from 0.1 to 0.9, respectively. Figure 15 shows the box plots of STMIMAFC in terms of clustering accuracies of 10 runs.

As is shown in Fig. 15 , When the value of  X  is in the range [0.3, 0.5], STMIMAFC obtains [0.4, 0.6], STMIMAFC works well. In view of the analysis above, the reasonable value of  X  should be set in the range [0.4, 0.5]. In this paper, we set  X  = 0 . 4. 5 STMIMAFC for image segmentation
In this section, we report the results of applying four automatic clustering algorithms to the segmentation of five synthetic texture images. In these five synthetic texture images, the first texture image has two class classes, the second image has three classes, the third and the fourth image have four classes, and the last image has five classes. These texture images have different numbers of clusters with varying complexities, and all of them come in 256  X  256. Since we segmented images based on the pixels of segmented image, for each image, MOCK will overflow the memory with its special coding way. We only give the corresponding segmentation results by GADE, MOMoDEFC and STMIMAFC. All parameters of three algorithms are set as in Sect. 4 .

Figures 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 20 show the five original synthetic texture images and their segmented counterparts obtained using GADE, MOMoDEFC and STMIMAFC. Because all images have the standard reference segmentation images, we also record the mean MS with its standard deviation and the mean number of classes found with its standard deviation in Tables 6 and 7 . The boldfaces in Tables 6 and 7 mean the best results among four algorithms.
From Figs. 16 and 17 we can see, STMIMAFC has the similar segmentation performance with MOMoDEFC for texture image 1 and texture image 2, and their performances are superior to GADE. From Figs. 18 and 19 , we can see that, for texture image 3 and texture image 4, STMIMAFC meets or beats other four competitors in keeping regional consistency and the edge preservation, GADE partition the edge area which connect different textures into one independent class, and MOMoDEFC performance worse in regional consistency. From Fig. 20 , one may observe that, for texture image 5, the segmentation performances of three multi-objective automatic clustering algorithms are not very good, while our approach still outperforms other compared algorithms.

From Tables 6 and 7 , one may see that, STMIMAFC not only finds better MS value, it also manages to find optimal number of clusters of the data points for most of texture images except for texture image 2. For texture image 2, although the GADE algorithm has the greatest MS value, the number of clusters obtained by GADE is much greater than the truth. For the first four texture images, STMIMAFC can find the right class number every time running. For the last texture image, all the compared algorithms do not find the true number of clusters and they yield to get larger number than truth, while the class number obtained by STMIMAFC is most close to the real value. 6Conclusion A novel immune multi-objective automatic clustering algorithm based on immune dominance and the clonal selection mechanism is proposed in this paper. Two new technologies are used in the proposed algorithm, including a synergy of two mutations and an exponential function based compactness validity index. Experimental results show that the new method outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-objective automatic clustering methods over most of data sets with different characteristics. Moreover, we apply the new approach to synthetic texture image segmentation, and the results further prove the advantage of our algorithm on the capacity of finding the optimal number of clusters and keeping regional consistency of image.
