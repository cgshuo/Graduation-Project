 Implicit relevance feedback (IRF) is the process by which a search system unobtrusively gathers evidence on searcher i nterests from their interaction with the system. IRF is a new method of gathering information on user interest and, if IRF is to be u sed in operational IR systems, it is important to establish when it perfo rms well and when it performs poorly. In this paper we investigate how the use and effectiveness of IRF is affected by three factors: search task complexity, the search experience of the user and t he stage in the search. Our findings suggest that all three of the se factors contribute to the utility of IRF. H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval] Experimentation, Human Factors. Implicit Relevance Feedback, Relevance Feedback Information Retrieval (IR) systems are designed to help searchers solve problems. In the traditional interaction met aphor employed by Web search systems such as Yahoo! and MSN Search, t he system generally only supports the retrieval of potentiall y relevant documents from the collection. However, it is also possible to offer support to searchers for different search activities, such as selecting the terms to present to the system or choosing which search stra tegy to adopt [3, 8]; both of which can be problematic for searchers.
 As the quality of the query submitted to the system directly affects the quality of search results, the issue of how to impr ove search queries has been studied extensively in IR research [6]. T echniques such as Relevance Feedback (RF) [11] have been proposed as a way in which the IR system can support the iterative development of a search query by suggesting alternative terms for query modificat ion. However, in practice RF techniques have been underutilised as t hey place an increased cognitive burden on searchers to directly indicate relevant results [10]. Implicit Relevance Feedback (IRF) [7] has been prop osed as a way in which search queries can be improved by passively o bserving searchers as they interact. IRF has been implemente d either through the use of surrogate measures based on interaction with documents (such as reading time, scrolling or document retent ion) [7] or using interaction with browse-based result interfaces [5] . IRF has been shown to display mixed effectiveness because the fa ctors that are good indicators of user interest are often erratic and t he inferences drawn from user interaction are not always valid [7]. In this paper we present a study into the use and e ffectiveness of IRF in an online search environment. The study aims to investigate the factors that affect IRF, in particular three resear ch questions: (i) is the use of and perceived quality of terms generated by IRF affected by the search task? (ii) is the use of and perceived quali ty of terms generated by IRF affected by the level of search experience o f system users? (iii) is IRF equally used and does it generate terms that are equally useful at all search stages? This study aims to establish whe n, and under what circumstances, IRF performs well in terms of its us e and the query modification terms selected as a result of its use.
 The main experiment from which the data are taken w as designed to test techniques for selecting query modification te rms and techniques for displaying retrieval results [13]. In this pap er we use data derived from that experiment to study factors affecting the utility of IRF. In this section we describe the user study conducte d to address our research questions. Our study used two systems both of which suggested new query terms to the user. One system suggested terms based on th e user X  X  interaction (IRF), the other used Explicit RF (ERF) asking the user to explicitly indicate relevant material. Both systems used the s ame term suggestion algorithm, [15], and used a common interface. In both systems, retrieved documents are represente d at the interface representations, created at retrieval time. We use d the Web as the test collection in this study and Google 1 as the underlying search engine. Document representations include the document title and a summary of the document; a list of top-ranking sentences (TRS) extracted from the top documents retrieved, scored in relation to the query, a sentence in the document summary, and each summary sentence in the context it occurs in the document (i.e., with the preceding and following http://www.google.com/ 35 sentence). Each summary sentence and top-ranking s entence is regarded as a representation of the document. The default display document titles. Interacting with a representation guides searchers to a different representation from the same document, e. g., moving the mouse over a document title displays a summary of t he document. This presentation of progressively more information from documents to aid relevance assessments has been shown to be e ffective in earlier work [14, 16]. In Appendix A we show the complete interface to the IRF system with the document representations marked and in Appendix B we show a fragment from the ERF interfac e with the checkboxes used by searchers to indicate relevant i nformation. Both systems provide an interactive query expansion feat ure by suggesting new query terms to the user. The searcher has the r esponsibility for choosing which, if any, of these terms to add to th e query. The searcher can also add or remove terms from the quer y at will. This version of the system implements explicit RF. Next to each document representation are checkboxes that allow s earchers to mark individual representations as relevant; marking a representation is an indication that its contents are relevant. Only th e representations marked relevant by the user are used for suggesting new query terms. This system was used as a baseline against which th e IRF system could be compared. This system makes inferences about searcher interes ts based on the information with which they interact. As described in Section 2.1.1 interacting with a representation highlights a new representation from the same document. To the searcher this is a way th ey can find out more information from a potentially interesting sou rce. To the implicit RF system each interaction with a representation is interpreted as an implicit indication of interest in that representat ion; interacting with a representation is assumed to be an indication that its contents are relevant. The query modification terms are selected using the same algorithm as in the Explicit RF system. Therefore the only difference between the systems is how relevance is communicate d to the system. The results of the main experiment [13] indicated t hat these two systems were comparable in terms of effectiveness. Search tasks were designed to encourage realistic s earch behaviour by our subjects. The tasks were phrased in the form of simulated wor k task situations [2], i.e., short search scenarios t hat were designed to reflect real-life search situations and allow subje cts to develop personal assessments of relevance. We devised six search topics (i.e., applying to university, allergies in the workplace, art galleries in Rome,  X  X hird Generation X  mobile phones, Internet mu sic piracy and petrol prices) based on pilot testing with a small representative group of subjects. These subjects were not involved in th e main experiment. For each topic, three versions of each work task si tuation were devised, each version differing in their predicted level of task complexity . As described in [1] task complexity is a variable that affects subject perceptions of a task and their int eractive behaviour, e.g., subjects perform more filtering activities wi th highly complex search tasks. By developing tasks of different comp lexity we can assess how the nature of the task affects the subje cts X  interactive behaviour and hence the evidence supplied to IRF al gorithms. Task complexity was varied according to the methodology described in [1], specifically by varying the number of potential inf ormation sources and types of information required, to complete a ta sk. In our pilot tests (and in a posteriori analysis of the main experiment results) we verified that subjects reporting of individual task complexity matched our estimation of the complexity of the task. Subjects attempted three search tasks: one high com plexity, one moderate complexity and one low complexity 2 . They were asked to read the task, place themselves in the situation it described and find the information they felt was required to complete the task. Figure 1 shows the task statements for three levels of task complexity for one of the six search topics. HC Task: High Complexity MC Task: Moderate Complexity LC Task: Low Complexity 156 volunteers expressed an interest in participati ng in our study. 48 subjects were selected from this set with the aim o f populating two groups, each with 24 subjects: inexperienced (infrequent/ inexperienced searchers) and experienced (frequent/ experienced searchers). Subjects were not chosen and classifie d into their groups until they had completed an entry questionnaire tha t asked them about their search experience and computer use. The average age of the subjects was 22.83 years (ma ximum 51, minimum 18,  X  = 5.23 years) and 75% had a university diploma or a higher degree. 47.91% of subjects had, or were pur suing, a qualification in a discipline related to Computer S cience. The subjects were a mixture of students, researchers, academic s taff and others, with different levels of computer and search experience. The subjects were divided into the two groups depending on their sear ch experience, how often they searched and the types of searches they performed. All were familiar with Web searching, and some with sea rching in other domains. The experiment had a factorial design; with 2 level s of search experience, 3 experimental systems (although we on ly report on the findings from the ERF and IRF systems) and 3 levels of search task complexity. Subjects attempted one task of each co mplexity, The main experiment from which these results are d rawn had a third comparator system which had a different interface. Each subject carried out three tasks, one on each system. We onl y report on the results from the ERF and IRF systems as these are t he only pertinent ones for this paper. 36 switched systems after each task and used each syst em once. The order in which systems were used and search tasks a ttempted was randomised according to a Latin square experimental design. Questionnaires used Likert scales, semantic differe ntials and open-ended questions to elicit subject opinions [4]. Sy stem logging was also used to record subject interaction. A tutorial carried out prior to the experiment allo wed subjects to use a non-feedback version of the system to attempt a pra ctice task before using the first experimental system. Experiments la sted between one-and-a-half and two hours, dependent on variables su ch as the time spent completing questionnaires. Subjects were off ered a 5 minute break after the first hour. In each experiment: i. the subject was welcomed and asked to read an intro duction to ii. the subject was asked to complete an introductory q uestionnaire. iii. the subject was given a tutorial on the interface, followed by a iv. the subject was given three task sheets and asked t o choose one v. the subject was asked to perform the search and was given 15 vi. after completion of the search, the subject was ask ed to complete vii. the remaining tasks were attempted by the subject, following viii. the subject completed a post-experiment questionnai re and Subjects were told that their interaction may be us ed by the IRF system to help them as they searched. They were not told which behaviours would be used or how it would be used. We now describe the findings of our analysis. In this section we use the data derived from the ex periment to answer our research questions about the effect of search t ask complexity, search experience and stage in search on the use an d effectiveness of IRF. We present our findings per research question . Due to the ordinal nature of much of the data non-parametric s tatistical testing is unless otherwise stated. We use the method propose d by [12] to determine the significance of differences in multip le comparisons and variables, the occurrence of which we report where appropriate. All Likert scales and semantic differentials were on a 5-point scale where a rating closer to 1 signifies more agreement with the attitude statement. The category labels HC, MC and LC are u sed to denote the high, moderate and low complexity tasks respectivel y. The highest, or most positive, values in each table are shown in bo ld. Our analysis uses data from questionnaires, post-experiment inte rviews and background system logging on the ERF and IRF system s. Searchers attempted three search tasks of varying c omplexity, each on a different experimental system. In this section w e present an analysis on the use and usefulness of IRF for search tasks o f different complexities. We present our findings in terms of the RF provided by subjects and the terms recommended by the systems. We use questionnaires and system logs to gather dat a on subject perceptions and provision of RF for different searc h tasks. In the post-search questionnaire subjects were asked about how RF was conveyed using differentials to elicit their opinion on: 1. the value of the feedback technique: How you conveyed relevance to the system (i.e. ticking boxes or viewing inform ation) was :  X  X asy X  /  X  X ifficult X ,  X  X ffective X /  X  X neffective X ,  X  X seful X  X /  X  X ot useful X . 2. the process of providing the feedback: How you conveyed relevance to the system made you feel:  X  X omfortable X / X  X ncomfortable X ,  X  X n control X / X  X ot in control X . The average obtained differential values are shown in Table 1 for IRF and each task category. The value corresponding to the differential statement. This gives some overall understanding o f the subjects X  feelings which can be useful as the subjects may no t answer individual differentials very precisely. The values for ERF a re included for reference in this table and all other tables and fi gures in the  X  X indings X  section. Since the aim of the paper is to investig ate situations in which IRF might perform well, not a direct comparison bet ween IRF and ERF, we make only limited comparisons between these two types of feedback. Each cell in Table 1 summarises the subject respons es for 16 task-system pairs (16 subjects who ran a high complexity (HC) task on the ERF system, 16 subjects who ran a medium complexity (MC) task on the ERF system, etc). Kruskal-Wallis Tests were ap plied to each differential for each type of RF 3 . Subject responses suggested that IRF Since this analysis involved many differentials, w e use a Bonferroni correction to control the experiment-wise error rat e and set the alpha respectively, i.e., .05 divided by the number of di fferentials. This correction reduces the number of Type I errors i.e. , rejecting null hypotheses that are true.

Subject perceptions of IRF elicited using the ot her differentials did not appear to be affected by the complexity of the search task 6 . To determine whether a relationship exists betwe en the effectiveness and usefulness of the IRF process and task complexity we applied Spearman X  X  Rank Order Correlation Coeffi cient to participant responses. The results of this analysi s suggest that the effectiveness of IRF and usefulness of IRF are both related to task complexity; as task complexity increases subject pr eference for IRF also increases 7 . On the other hand, subjects felt ERF was more  X  effective  X  and  X  useful  X  for low complexity tasks 8 . Their verbal reporting of ERF, where perceived utility and effectiveness increased as ta sk complexity decreased, supports this finding. In tasks of lowe r complexity the subjects felt they were better able to provide feed back on whether or not documents were relevant to the task. We analyse interaction logs generated by both inter faces to investigate the amount of RF subjects provided. To do this we use a measure of search  X  X recision X  that is the proportion of all po ssible document representations that a searcher assessed, divided b y the total number they could assess. In ERF this is the proportion o f all possible representations that were marked relevant by the se archer, i.e., those representations explicitly marked relevant. In IRF this is the proportion of representations viewed by a searcher over all possible representations that could have been viewed by the searcher. This proportion measures the searcher X  X  level of interac tion with a document, we take it to measure the user X  X  interest in the document: the more document representations viewed the more i nterested we assume a user is in the content of the document. There are a maximum of 14 representations per docum ent: 4 top-ranking sentences, 1 title, 1 summary, 4 summary se ntences and 4 summary sentences in document context. Since the i nterface shows document representations from the top-30 documents, there are 420 representations that a searcher can assess. Table 2 shows proportion of representations provided as RF by subjects. Measure Proportion Feedback 2.14 2.39 2.65 21.50 19.36 15.32 Documents Viewed 10.63 10.43 10.81 10.84 12.19 14.81 For IRF there is a clear pattern: as complexity inc reases the subjects viewed fewer documents but viewed more representati ons for each document. This suggests a pattern where users are i nvestigating retrieved documents in more depth. It also means th at the amount of effective :  X  2 (2) = 11.62, p = .003; useful :  X  2 (2) = 12.43, p = .002 Dunn X  X  post-hoc tests (multiple comparison using rank sums); all Z 2.88, all p  X  .002 all  X  2 (2)  X  2.85, all p  X  .24 (Kruskal-Wallis Tests) effective : all r  X  0.644, p  X  .002; useful : all r effective :  X  2 (2) = 7.01, p = .03; useful :  X  2 (Kruskal-Wallis Test); all pair-wise differences si gnificant, all Z 2.34, all p  X  .01 (Dunn X  X  post-hoc tests) feedback varies based on the complexity of the sear ch task. Since IRF is based on the interaction of the searcher, the mo re they interact, the more feedback they provide. This has no effect on the number of RF terms chosen, but may affect the quality of the ter ms selected. Correlation analysis revealed a strong negative cor relation between the number of documents viewed and the amount of feedba ck searchers provide 9 ; as the number of documents viewed increases the p roportion of feedback falls (searchers view less representati ons of each document). This may be a natural consequence of th eir being less time to view documents in a time constrained task enviro nment but as we will show as complexity changes, the nature of info rmation searchers interact with also appears to change. In the next section we investigate the effect of task complexity on the terms chosen a s a result of IRF. The same RF algorithm was used to select query modi fication terms in all systems [16]. We use subject opinions of terms recommended by the systems as a measure of the effectiveness of IR F with respect to the terms generated for different search tasks. To tes t this, subjects were asked to complete two semantic differentials that c ompleted the statement: The words chosen by the system were :  X  X elevant X / X  X rrelevant X  and  X  X seful X / X  X ot useful X . Table 3 presents average responses grouped by search task.
 Table 3. Subject perceptions of system terms (lower = better). Differential Relevant 2.50 2.46 2.41 1.94 2.35 2.68 Useful 2.61 2.61 2.59 2.06 2.54 2.70 Kruskal-Wallis Tests were applied within each type of RF. The results indicate that the relevance and usefulness of the t erms chosen by IRF is affected by the complexity of the search task; t he terms chosen are more  X  relevant  X  and  X  useful  X  when the search task is more complex Relevant here, was explained as being related to th eir task whereas useful was for terms that were seen as being helpfu l in the search task. For ERF, the results indicate that the terms genera ted are perceived to be more  X  relevant  X  and  X  useful X  for less complex search tasks; although differences between tasks were not signifi cant suggests that subject perceptions of the terms chos en for query modification are affected by task complexity. Comp arison between ERF and IRF shows that subject perceptions also va ry for different types of RF 12 . As well as using data on relevance and utility of t he terms chosen, we used data on term acceptance to measure the perceived value of the terms suggested. Explicit and Implicit RF systems m ade recommendations about which terms could be added to the original search query. In Table 4 we show the proportion of the top six terms that were shown to the searcher that were added t o the search query, for each type of task and each type of RF. r =  X  0.696, p = .001 (Pearson X  X  Correlation Coefficient) relevant :  X  2 (2) = 13.82, p = .001; useful :  X  2 (2) = 11.04, p = .004; = .025 all  X  2 (2)  X  2.28, all p  X  .32 (Kruskal-Wallis Test) all T (16)  X  102, all p  X  .021, (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test) This was the smallest number of query modification terms that were offered in both systems. 38
Proportion of terms HC MC LC HC MC LC Accepted 65.31 67.32 68.65 67.45 67.24 67.59 The average number of terms accepted from IRF is ap proximately the same across all search tasks and generally the same as that of ERF As Table 2 shows, subjects marked fewer documents r elevant for highly complex tasks . Therefore, when task comple xity increases the ERF system has fewer examples of relevant documents and the expansion terms generated may be poorer. This coul d explain the difference in the proportion of recommended terms a ccepted in ERF as task complexity increases. For IRF there is litt le difference in how many of the recommended terms were chosen by subjec ts for each level of task complexity 15 . Subjects may have perceived IRF terms as more useful for high complexity tasks but this was not reflected in the proportion of IRF terms accepted. Differences may reside in the nature of the terms accepted; future work will inve stigate this issue. In this section we have presented an investigation on the effect of search task complexity on the utility of IRF. From the results there appears to be a strong relation between the complex ity of the task and the subject interaction: subjects preferring IRF fo r highly complex tasks. Task complexity did not affect the proporti on of terms accepted in either RF method, despite there being a differen ce in how  X  relevant  X  and  X  useful  X  subjects perceived the terms to be for different complexities; complexity may affect term selection in ways other than the proportion of terms accepted. Experienced searchers may interact differently and give different types of evidence to RF than inexperienced searchers. As such, levels of search experience may affect searchers X  use and per ceptions of IRF. In our experiment subjects were divided into two group s based on their level of search experience, the frequency with whic h they searched and the types of searches they performed. In this sect ion we use their perceptions and logging to address the next researc h question; the relationship between the usefulness and use of IRF and the search experience of experimental subjects. The data are the same as that analysed in the previous section, but here we focus on search experience rather than the search task. We analyse the results from the attitude statements described at the beginning of Section 3.1.1. (i.e., How you conveyed relevance to the system was... and How you conveyed relevance to the system made you feel... ). These differentials elicited opinion from exper imental subjects about the RF method used. In Table 5 we s how the mean average responses for inexperienced and experienced subject groups on ERF and IRF; 24 subjects per cell. all T (16)  X  80, all p  X  .31, (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test) Wallis Tests) The results demonstrate a strong preference in inex perienced subjects for IRF; they found it more  X  easy  X  and  X  effective  X  than experienced subjects. 16 The differences for all other IRF differentials we re not inexperienced subjects generally preferred IRF over ERF Inexperienced subjects also felt that IRF was more difficult to control than experienced subjects 18 . As these subjects have less search experience they may be less able to understand RF p rocesses and may be more comfortable with the system gathering feedb ack implicitly from their interaction. Experienced subjects tended to like ERF more than inexperienced subjects and felt more  X  comfortable  X  with this feedback method 19 . It appears from these results that experienced subjects found ERF more useful and were more at eas e with the ERF process. In a similar way to Section 3.1.1 we analysed the p roportion of feedback that searchers provided to the experimenta l systems. Our analysis suggested that search experience does not affect the amount of feedback subjects provide 20 . We used questionnaire responses to gauge subject op inion on the relevance and usefulness of the terms from the pers pective of experienced and inexperienced subjects. Table 6 sh ows the average differential responses obtained from both subject g roups. Table 6. Subject perceptions of system terms (lower = better).

In the same way as in Section 3.1.2, we analysed the number of query modification terms rec ommended by the system that were used by experimental subjects. Ta ble 7 shows the average number of accepted terms per subject group.

Proportion of terms Inexp. Exp. Inexp. Exp. Accepted 63.76 70.44 64.43 71.35 Our analysis of the data show that differences betw een subject groups for each type of RF are significant; experienced su bjects accepted more expansion terms regardless of type of RF. Howe ver, the differences between the same groups for different t ypes of RF are not significant; subjects chose roughly the same percen tage of expansion terms offered irrespective of the type of RF 22 . In this section we have analysed data gathered from two subject groups  X  inexperienced searchers and experienced se archers  X  on how they perceive and use IRF. The results indicate th at inexperienced subjects found IRF more  X  easy  X  and  X  effective  X  than experienced subjects, who in turn found the terms chosen as a r esult of IRF more  X  relevant  X  and  X  useful  X . We also showed that inexperienced subjects generally accepted less recommended terms than expe rienced subjects, perhaps because they were less comfortable with RF or generally submitted shorter search queries. Search experience appears to affect how subjects use the terms recommended as a result of the RF process. From our observations of experimental subjects as t hey searched we conjectured that RF may be used differently at diff erent times during a search. To test this, our third research question c oncerned the use and usefulness of IRF during the course of a search. In this section we investigate whether the amount of RF provided by se archers or the proportion of terms accepted are affected by how fa r through their search they are. For the purposes of this analysis a search begins when a subject poses the first query to the system and p rogresses until they terminate the search or reach the maximum allowed t ime for a search task of 15 minutes. We do not divide tasks based o n this limit as subjects often terminated their search in less than 15 minutes. In this section we use data gathered from interacti on logs and subject opinions to investigate the extent to which RF was used and the extent to which it appeared to benefit our experimental su bjects at different stages in their search The interaction logs for all searches on the Explic it RF and Implicit RF were analysed and each search is divided up into nine equal length time slices. This number of slices gave us an equa l number per stage and was a sufficient level of granularity to identi fy trends in the results. Slices 1  X  3 correspond to the  X  X tart X  of the searc h, 4  X  6 to the  X  X iddle X  of the search and 7  X  9 to the  X  X nd X . In Figure 2 we plot the measure of  X  X recision X  described in Section 3.1.1 ( i.e., the proportion of all possible representations that were provided as RF) at each of the nine slices, per search task, averaged across all s ubjects; this allows us to see how the provision of RF was distributed duri ng a search. The IRF: U (24) = 403, p = .009, ERF: U (24) = 396, p = .013 total amount of feedback for a single RF method/tas k complexity pairing across all nine slices corresponds to the v alue recorded in the first row of Table 2 (e.g., the sum of the RF for I RF/HC across all nine slices of Figure 2 is 21.50%). To simplify the sta tistical analysis and comparison we use the grouping of  X  X tart X ,  X  X iddle X  and  X  X nd X . Figure 2 appears to show the existence of a relatio nship between the stage in the search and the amount of relevance inf ormation provided to the different types of feedback algorithm. These are essentially differences in the way users are assessing document s. In the case of ERF subjects provide explicit relevance assessments throughout most of the search, but there is generally a steep incre ase in the  X  X nd X  phase towards the completion of the search 23 . When using the IRF system, the data indicates that at the start of the search subjects are providing little relevance info rmation corresponds to interacting with few document repres entations. At this stage the subjects are perhaps concentrating more o n reading the retrieved results. Implicit relevance information i s generally offered extensively in the middle of the search as they int eract with results and correspond to stages of initial exploration, detail ed analysis of document representations and storage and presentati on of findings. Figure 2 also shows the proportion of feedback for tasks of different complexity. The results appear to show a differenc e specifically, as complexity increases it appears as though subjects take longer to reach their most interactive point. This suggests that task complexity affects how IRF is distributed during th e search and that they may be spending more time initially interpreti ng search results for more complex tasks. The terms recommended by the system are chosen base d on the frequency of their occurrence in the relevant items . That is, non-stopword, non-query terms occurring frequently in s earch results IRF: all Z  X  1.87, p  X  .031, ERF:  X  X tart X  vs.  X  X nd X  Z = 2.58, p = .005 (Dunn X  X  post-hoc tests). Although increasing toward the end of the  X  X tart X  stage. (Friedman Rank Sum Test) 40 regarded as relevant are likely to be recommended t o the searcher for query modification. Since there is a direct associ ation between the RF and the terms selected we use the number of terms a ccepted by searchers at different points in the search as an i ndication of how effective the RF has been up until the current poin t in the search. In this section we analysed the average number of term s from the top six terms recommended by Explicit RF and Implicit RF ov er the course of a search. The average proportion of the top six re commended terms that were accepted at each stage are shown in Table 8; each cell contains data from all 48 subjects. 
Proportion of terms start middle end start middle end Accepted 66.87 66.98 67.34 61.85 68.54 73.22 The results show an apparent association between th e stage in the search and the number of feedback terms subjects ac cept. Search stage search a searcher progresses, the more likely they are to accept terms recommended via IRF (significantly more than ERF 27 ). A correlation analysis between the proportion of terms accepted a t each search stage and cumulative RF (i.e., the sum of all  X  X recision X  at each slice in Figure 2 up to and including the end of the search stage) suggests that in both types of RF the quality of system terms imp roves as more RF is provided 28 . The results from this section indicate that the loc ation in a search affects the amount of feedback given by the user to the system, and hence the amount of information that the RF mechani sm has to decide the complexity of the task affects how subjects pro vide IRF and the proportion of system terms accepted. In this section we discuss the implications of the findings presented in the previous section for each research question. The results of our study showed that ERF was prefer red for less complex tasks and IRF for more complex tasks. From observations and subject comments we perceived that when using E RF systems subjects generally forgot to provide the feedback b ut also employed different criteria during the ERF process (i.e., th ey were assessing relevance rather than expressing an interest). Whe n the search was more complex subjects rarely found results they reg arded as completely relevant. Therefore they struggled to f ind relevant information and were unable to communicate RF to th e search system. In these situations subjects appeared to prefer IRF as they do not need to make a relevance decision to obtain the benefits of RF, i.e., term suggestions, whereas in ERF they do. ERF:  X  2 (2) = 2.22, p = .33; IRF:  X  2 (2) = 7.73, p = .021 (Friedman 
Rank Sum Tests); IRF: all pair-wise comparisons sig nificant at Z 1.77, all p  X  .038 (Dunn X  X  post-hoc tests) all T (48)  X  786, all p  X  .002, (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test) IRF: r = .712, p &lt; .001, ERF: r = .695, p = .001 (Pearson Correlation Coefficient) The association between RF method and task complexi ty has implications for the design of user studies of RF s ystems and the RF systems themselves. It implies that in the design of user studies involving ERF or IRF systems care should be taken t o include tasks of varying complexities, to avoid task bias. Also, in the design of search systems it implies that since different types of RF may be appropriate for different task complexities then a system that could automatically detect complexity could use both ERF and IRF simult aneously to benefit the searcher. For example, on the IRF syst em we noticed that as task complexity falls search behaviour shifts fr om results interface to retrieved documents. Monitoring such interactio n across a number of studies may lead to a set of criteria that could help IR systems automatically detect task complexity and tailor sup port to suit. We analysed the affect of search experience on the utility of IRF. Our analysis revealed a general preference across all s ubjects for IRF over ERF. That is, the average ratings assigned to IRF were generally more positive than those assigned to ERF. However, IRF was generally liked by both subject groups (perhaps because it re moved the burden of providing relevance information) and ERF was gen erally preferred by experienced subjects more than inexperienced sub jects (perhaps because it allowed them to specify which results we re used by the system when generating term recommendations). All subjects felt more in control with ERF than IRF, but for inexperienced subjects this did not appear to affec t their overall preferences 29 . These subjects may understand the RF process les s, but may be more willing to sacrifice control over feedb ack in favour of IRF, a process that they perceive more positively. We also analysed the effects of search stage on the use and usefulness of IRF. Through analysis of this nature we can bui ld a more complete picture of how searchers used RF and how this varie s based on the RF method. The results suggest that IRF is used more in the middle of the search than at the beginning or end, whereas ER F is used more towards the end. The results also show the effects of task complexity on the IRF process and how rapidly subjects reach t heir most been possible to establish the existence of such pa tterns of behaviour. The findings suggest that searchers interact differ ently for IRF and ERF. Since ERF is not traditionally used until tow ard the end of the search it may be possible to incorporate both IRF a nd ERF into the same IR system, with IRF being used to gather evide nce until subjects decide to use ERF. The development of such a syste m represents part of our ongoing work in this area. In this paper we have presented an investigation of Implicit Relevance Feedback (IRF). We aimed to answer three research questions about factors that may affect the provision and usefulnes s of IRF. These factors were search task complexity, the subjects X  search experience and the stage in the search. Our overall conclusio n was that all factors appear to have some effect on the use and effective ness of IRF, although the interaction effects between factors ar e not statistically significant. This may also be true for experienced subjects, bu t the data we have is insufficient to draw this conclusion. 41 Our conclusions per each research question are: (i) IRF is generally more useful for complex search tasks, where searche rs want to focus on the search task and get new ideas for their sear ch from the system, (ii) IRF is preferred to ERF overall and generally preferred by inexperienced subjects wanting to reduce the burden of providing RF, and (iii) within a single search session IRF is aff ected by temporal location in a search (i.e., it is used in the middl e, not the beginning or end) and task complexity. Studies of this nature are important to establish t he circumstances where a promising technique such as IRF are useful and those when it is not. It is only after such studies have been ru n and analysed in this way can we develop an understanding of IRF that all ow it to be successfully implemented in operational IR systems.
