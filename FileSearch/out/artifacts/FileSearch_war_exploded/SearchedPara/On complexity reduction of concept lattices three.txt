 Michal Krupka Abstract We discuss the paper by Cheung and Vogel, Inf Retr 8(2), pp 285 X 299 ( 2005 ). We introduce some counterexamples showing that the theoretical results, the paper is based upon, are incorrect.
 Keywords Information retrieval Lattice theory Concept lattice Complexity reduction 1 Introduction Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a method of exploratory analysis of tabular data (Ganter and Wille 1999 ; Wille 1982 ). The method identifies important clusters (called formal lattices from term-document matrices.

In FCA, users often encounter an obstacle when working with large data collections, namely, that concept lattices constructed from the data can be quite large. In Cheung and Vogel ( 2005 ), a method of reducing the complexity of concept lattices is introduced and applied to concept lattices constructed from term-document matrices. The idea is to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to aggregate some rows in the input matrix and then Kumar and Srinivas ( 2010 ) where fuzzy K -means clustering has been used instead of SVD. The method by Cheung and Vogel ( 2005 ) compares two lattices: a concept lattice L , computed from a term-document matrix, and a concept lattice K , computed from a simpler matrix, obtained from the original term-document matrix by aggregation of rows. The authors claim that there exists a surjective homomorphism from L to K and that K is isomorphic to the quotient lattice L / h , where h is a congruence relation induced by the row aggregation. A consequence of this claim is that K has lower complexity than L .
In this paper, we present three counterexamples showing that the above authors X  claim is incorrect. Namely, in Counterexample 1 we show that the equivalence relation h need exist. Counterexample 2 contradicts the authors X  claim that the lattices L and K are homomorphic. Finally, Counterexample 3 shows that for some aggregations of rows the size of K is actually greater than the size of L . 2 Concept lattices We start by briefly recalling basics of Lattice Theory and FCA used by Cheung and Vogel ( 2005 ). More details can be found in the introductory book (Ganter and Wille 1999 ). supremum (denoted by u 1 _ u 2 ) and infimum (denoted by u 1 ^ u 2 ). A mapping f : L ? K of two lattices L and K is called a lattice homomorphism (or homomorphism ) if it preserves u isomorphic .

In Definition 8 of Cheung and Vogel ( 2005 ), the authors call lattices L and K homo-morphic if there exists a homomorphism between L and K . It should be clarified that this homomorphism must be surjective. Otherwise, any two lattices would be homomorphic, since any constant mapping from L to K (i.e., a mapping sending each element of L to a single chosen element of K ) is a homomorphism.
 any congruence h on L the quotient set L / h is a lattice with suprema and infima defined by means of representatives: L ? L / h is a lattice homomorphism. Conversely, for any lattice homomorphism f : L ? K , the relation h f on L defined by is a congruence. If f is surjective then the lattices L / h f and K are isomorphic.
By formal context we understand a triple C = ( G , M , I ) where G is a set of objects, M a set of attributes and I G M a binary relation. The meaning of  X  g ; m  X 2 I is  X  X  X he object g has the attribute m  X  X . The relation I can be represented by a table with binary data with rows corresponding to attributes and columns to objects.
 For subsets A G and B M we set If A 0 = B and B 0 = A then the pair ( A , B ) is called a formal concept of ( G , M , I ). ( G , M , I ).
 Example 1 Consider a formal context C = ( G , M , I ) where sets M = { m 1 , m 2 , m 3 , m 4 } m 1 =  X  X  X  X  X , m 2 =  X  X  X hink X  X , m 3 =  X  X  X m X  X , m 4 =  X  X  X herefore X  X , documents g 1 =  X  X  X  X  X , g 2 = term-document matrix from Table 1 , the associated lattice L is depicted in Fig. 1 . 3 The counterexamples ( 2005 ) and show three counterexamples.
 construct a new term-document matrix where the rows corresponding to equivalent terms are replaced with a single row.
 Definition (Cheung, Vogel) Let C be a formal context representing a term-document i th row is obtained from C by taking unions of rows of C . 1 m . The expression  X  X  X nion of rows X  X  from the above definition should be understood in this context. Thus, the definition can be clarified as follows. For a nonempty set of attributes N M and a new attribute m 6 2 M we set M  X  X  M n N  X [f m g and define a binary relation I G M by for any g 2 G ; m 2 M n N : The formal context C  X  X  G ; M ; I  X  is a collapse of C .
According to the paper, C  X  X  X learly X  X  induces an equivalence relation h on the concept reasonable possibility is the following. Let p : M ! M be the quotient projection, i.e., the mapping assigning to each m 2 M n N the attribute m itself and to each m 2 N the new ( A 1 , B 1 ) h ( A 2 , B 2 ) if and only if p ( B 1 ) = p ( B 2 ).

Note that this definition is in accordance with the definition of I as I  X  X  Id G p  X  X  I  X  ; where Id G 9 p is the projection from G 9 M to G M sending each ( g , m )to ( 2005 ) correct.
 Proposition (Cheung, Vogel) Let C be a formal context, and L its associated lattice. If C is a collapse of C , then there is a lattice K associated with C ; where K is homomorphic to L .

Note that the wording  X  X  X here is a lattice K associated with C  X  X  is somewhat confusing; lattice K , associated with C ; is homomorphic to L  X  X  .

In the proof, the authors assume that the equivalence h on L , induced by C ; is a lattice is associated with C and set K = L / h .
 In the following counterexamples we show that 1. h need not be a lattice congruence, 2. K need not be homomorphic to L at all and 3. L / h need not be in bijection with K . Counterexample 1 Consider the formal context C = ( G , M , I ) from Example 1 and its dashed ovals and connected with the corresponding elements of K by arrows. congruence on L .
 Counterexample 2 In the setting of the previous counterexample, suppose that there u v there is no u 2 L such that f 0 ( u ) = v 2 and f 0 does not exist.
 mal context C = ( G , M , I ) from Table 3 and its collapse C  X  X  G ; M ; I  X  for M  X  f m 1 ; m ; m 4 ; m 5 g from Table 4 . The associated lattices L , K are depicted in Fig. 3 .
The concept lattice K has more elements than the original lattice L : the formal concept  X f g 2 ; g 3 g ; f m g X 2 K does not correspond to any class of h .
 4 Conclusion and open problems Among the three counterexamples, the most important one is Counterexample 1. In fact, most of the examples given by Cheung and Vogel ( 2005 ) and Aswani Kumar and Srinivas ( 2010 ) contain the problem demonstrated by Counterexample 1. Counterexample 2 is given primarily as a direct answer to the main theorem from Cheung and Vogel ( 2005 ). Counterexample 3 shows that after applying the method by Cheung and Vogel ( 2005 ), the size of concept lattice may increase rather than decrease.

The idea presented in Cheung and Vogel ( 2005 ) is appealing. However, there are some problems, identified in this paper, demanding clarification. The following issues need to be addressed. 1. What are consequences of the fact that h is not a congruence and lattices L and K are 2. How to deal with the problem of superfluous concepts in K (Counterexample 3)? Can References
