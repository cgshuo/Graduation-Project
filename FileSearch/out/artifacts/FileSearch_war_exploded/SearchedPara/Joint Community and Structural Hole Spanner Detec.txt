Detecting communities (or modular structures) and struc-tural hole spanners, the nodes bridging different communi-ties in a network, are two essential tasks in the realm of network analytics. Due to the topological nature of com-munities and structural hole spanners, these two tasks are naturally tangled with each other, while there has been lit-tle synergy between them. In this paper, we propose a novel harmonic modularity method to tackle both tasks simulta-neously. Specifically, we apply a harmonic function to mea-sure the smoothness of community structure and to obtain the community indicator. We then investigate the sparsity level of the interactions between communities, with particu-lar emphasis on the nodes connecting to multiple communi-ties, to discriminate the indicator of SH spanners and assist the community guidance. Extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed method out-performs several state-of-the-art methods in the community detection task and also in the SH spanner identification task (even the methods that require the supervised community information). Furthermore, by removing the SH spanners spotted by our method, we show that the quality of other community detection methods can be further improved.

Detecting communities (or modular structures) has been one of the flourishing issues in understanding the charac-teristics of real-world networks ( e.g. , computer networks, biological, semantic and social networks). Exemplar appli-cations include recognizing functions of protein in bioinfor-matics networks [36], and to forecast the information diffu-sion process in social networks [19]. It is non-trivial mainly because some bridging nodes, which keep the communica-tion between different communities, blur the boundary of communities. From another point of view, these bridging nodes, known as  X  X ubs X  in neurology and  X  X tructural hole (SH) spanners X  in sociology, have more control over the in-formation that is being transmitted among communities [1, 4, 20, 33]. In neurology, examining the function and role of these hubs is of special interest as they play a central role in establishing and maintaining efficient global brain communication, a crucial feature for healthy brain function-ing [1, 33]. In sociology, the theory of structural holes [4] suggests that individuals would acquire more potential re-sources from filling the  X  X oles X  between communities that are otherwise disconnected.

Due to the topological nature of communities and SH spanners, both detection tasks are naturally intermingled with each other. To date, however, studies on these two tasks have been performed independently. Traditional com-munity detection approaches focus on finding clusters such that nodes inside a cluster are tightly connected to each other than to nodes in other clusters. Division [11], ag-glomeration [22], label propagation [8], and optimization [7] which continuously update the network partition to mini-mize or maximize a given measure of the quality of the net-work partition ( e.g. , spectral clustering and modularity) are typical examples for such approaches. However, SH span-ners are inherently connected to multiple communities, ef-fectively linking diverse communities into a weakly-knit net-work. It X  X  not surprising that well defined communities in real world networks are hard to find without considering the existence of SH spanners.

For mining SH spanners, many approaches [5, 13, 18, 20, 28, 32] have been proposed. For example, the authors in [20] Figure 1: A simple network with three communities and six SH spanners assume the communities are known in advance and formu-late the SH spanners as the nodes such that after removing these nodes, the decrease of minimal cut for communities in network can be maximized. However, for most social net-works, it is often difficult to determine the boundaries of communities, as mentioned above. Furthermore, the quality of the identified SH spanners are determined by the com-munities, which are usually hard to be discovered without removing the SH spanners.

Without given the community information, several impor-tance measures, such as the PageRank [26] and degree cen-trality [16, 34] have been applied to identify nodes that are important in information diffusion. Some studies [5, 13, 32] utilize the betweenness measure to identify the SH spanners as nodes that have a large number of shortest paths that pass through them. Most recently, [28] proposes to identify the SH spanners by exploiting the bounded inverse closeness centralities of vertices and making use of articulation points of the network. However, the above methods fail to consider one of the most important properties of SH spanners: the information flows between communities are dominated by SH spanners.

Figure 1 illustrates an example of a network with three communities and six SH spanners, where the communities are enclosed by the dashed circles, SH spanners are repre-sented as the red nodes, and the cross edges that connect different communities are marked in blue color. One can no-tice that these SH spanners are either not having the high-est degree centrality or the highest betweenness centrality, but they are the only nodes that can spread information from one community to the other communities. When the community labels ( e.g. , C 1 , C 2 and C 3 ) are not available, though, it is hard to inspect the information flows between communities.

To unravel the tangled problems regarding community de-tection and SH spanner detection, we propose to tackle them simultaneously. For the sake of generality, we solely consider the topological structure of the given network. In this paper, we devise a HArmonic Modularity (HAM) scheme to formu-late the interaction between communities. Specifically, we apply a harmonic function to measure the harmony between each node and its neighbors, and produce harmonic assign-ment in each detected community, so that the internal nodes and their intra-community neighbors are as harmonious as possible. By investigating the sparsity level of the inter-actions between communities, with particular emphasis on the nodes connecting to multiple communities, we are able to discriminate the indicator of SH spanners and assist the community guidance.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
In this section we establish key definitions and notational conventions that simplify the exposition in later sections. Table 1 lists the important notations used in this paper.
Throughout this paper, matrices are written as boldface capital letters and vectors are denoted as boldface lower-case letters. For a matrix M  X  R n  X  m , its elements are denoted by m ij , and its i -th row, j -th column are denoted by m i , m j respectively. The Frobenius norm of M is de-defined as k M k 2 , 1 = P n i =1 m i 2 . For any vector u  X  Diag ( u )  X  R n  X  n is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal el-ements are u i . I n denotes an identity matrix with size n . k u k 0 is the ` 0 norm, which counts the number of nonzero elements in the vector u . We assume that there is a social network represented as an undirected graph G = ( V,E ), where V = { v 1 ,  X  X  X  ,v n } is the set of nodes and E  X  V  X  V is the set of edges whose element e ij = ( v i ,v j ) represents an interaction between the nodes v i and v j . We denote the ad-jacency matrix of G by A = [ a ij ], where 1  X  i,j  X | V | = n , a ij = 1 if node v i is connected by an edge to node v j and 0 otherwise. We assume no self loops, thus a ii = 0 for all i . In particular, assume that the nodes of the network can be grouped into m communities C = { C 1 ,  X  X  X  ,C m } , with V = C 1  X  X  X  X  X  C m and C i  X  C j =  X  for every pair i,j with i 6 = j .

Next, we establish the definitions and main properties of nodes which will be used to formulate the problem. Definition 1. (Internal Node) For any node v i  X  C p , if all of its neighboring nodes belong to C p , node v i is called an internal node. Definition 2. (Structural Hole Spanner) For any node v  X  C p , if there exists some neighboring nodes v j  X  C q ( p 6 = q ), node v i is called a structural hole spanner. Definition 3. (Intra-Community Neighbor) For any node v i  X  C p , if node v i connects with node v j  X  C p node v j is called an intra-community neighbor of node v i All the intra-community neighbors of node v i constitute its intra-community neighbor set.
 Definition 4. (Inter-Community Neighbor) For any node v i  X  C p , if node v i connects with node v j  X  C q node v j is called an inter-community neighbor of node v All the inter-community neighbors of node v i constitute its inter-community neighbor set.
 Definition 5. (Cross Edge) For any edge e ij = ( v i ,v j E , if v i and v j belong to different communities, edge e called a cross edge.
 Definition 6. (Harmonic Function) Given a network G = ( V,E ), a function h : V  X  R defined on nodes of G is called harmonic if for every v i  X  V where d i = P j a ij denotes the degree of node v i . Intuitively, at every node v i  X  V , the value of a harmonic function is equal to the average of its values at the neighboring nodes.
In this section, we first illustrate the formulation of our harmonic modularity (HAM) scheme. Then a detailed ap-proach is rendered to solve the objective function of HAM. Further, we investigate its convergence and computational complexity.
Key intuitions: In graph theory, a community is de-scribed as a group of nodes more densely connected with each other than with the rest of the network. Intuitively, community structure characterizes the neighborhood rela-tionships of the nodes, with nodes that are closer together in the graph having a similar community indicator. As such, the problem of community detection is much more related to the concept of intra-community neighbor . On the other hand, as SH spanners play a boundary-spanning role across communities, it is clear that the problem of top-k SH span-ner detection is much more related to the concept of inter-community neighbor . Most of the existing studies focus on either one or the other of these two assignments. However, by bringing these two assignments together, we can see that although community detection and top-k SH spanner de-tection assign graph nodes from two different aspects, they both measure neighborhood relationships. Such neighbor-hood relationships would correspond to the harmony and diversity of nodes, respectively. From Definition 6, we know the harmonic property provides a systematic way to quan-tify the harmony and diversity between the indicator value at a given node and the average of its neighboring nodes. Thus, we propose to jointly detect community and top-k SH spanners by measuring the harmonic modularity of the given network. To overcome limitations in prior work, we state the following desiderata: Building upon these desiderata, we proceed to present HAM. We first present how to measure the harmonic modularity, which itself can be used to learn community assignment, of the given network. Since SH spanners involve different communities, we then model and analyze the topology of SH spanners to quantify the influence exerted on commu-nities, which goes with the ability to identify SH spanners and improve community assignment. Let F  X  R n  X  m be the community indicator matrix, where f ij = 1 if a node v i is assigned to the j -th community, and 0 otherwise. The con-straints on F can be written as where k f i k 0 = 1 is utilized to indicate the community that the node v i most likely belongs to.

For each node v i , its community indicator f i should be as harmonious with its neighbors as possible, i.e. , the dif-ference between the value of f i and the averaged value of its neighbors 1 d a harmonic function can be embedded to learn the com-munity indicator matrix F . On the basis of the Harmonic analysis, we formulate the following minimization problem One can see if there are no cross edges or SH spanners in the network, the value of the objective function is essen-tially zero. However, when a node connects with the inter-community neighbors, it will leads to a relatively large value. SH spanner identification is expected to moderate this in-fluence, as the more influential SH spanner is more likely to get involved into interaction between communities. More-over, to exploit the formulation of (3) on community detec-tion more effectively, it is crucial for the community indica-tor matrix F to have discriminative ability for SH spanners, i.e. , promoting row-wise sparsity to discriminate relevant SH spanners. We introduce the ` 2 , 1 -norm penalty and orthog-onality constraint to make it and thus solve the following optimization problem Note that the relaxation of orthogonality condition has two benefits: it not only avoids solving the NP-hard problem of ` norm, but also allows the sparsity of the community indi-cator matrix F to be exploited. It can be seen the sparsity-inducing property of ` 2 , 1 norm pushes F to be sparse in rows. More specifically, f i shrinks to zero if the neighbors of node v belongs to different communities. In particular, the more inter-neighbors the node v i connects to the more different communities, the larger k f i  X  D  X  1 Af i k 2 2 is, so the value of f gets penalized more harshly. Therefore, we can obtain the top-k SH spanners corresponding to the top-k smallest val-ues of k f i k 2 . Further, the shrinkage of the f i diminishes the influence of the node v i on its neighbors, making them to be more harmonious with their intra-community neighbors.
It is not difficult to see that the formulation of (4) char-acterizes graph nodes from two different aspects: harmony and diversity. The harmonic modularity provides a measure of the smoothness of F over the edges in G , and thus help produce harmonic community assignment. The ` 2 , 1 norm provides an investigation on the sparsity level of the inter-actions between communities, and thus help discriminate SH spanners and assist the community guidance.
Directly minimizing Eq. (4) involving ` 2 , 1 norm is non-trivial. Here we propose an iterative algorithm based on the half-quadratic minimization [25] to solve this problem. We start by introducing the following lemma [15].
 Lemma 1. Let  X  ( . ) be a function satisfying the conditions: x  X   X  ( x ) is convex on R ; x  X   X  (  X  ( x ) =  X  (  X  x ) ,  X  x  X  R ;  X  ( x ) is C 1 on R ;  X  00 lim dual potential function  X  ( . ) , such that where p is determined by the minimizer function  X  ( . ) with respect to  X  ( . ) .

Let P = F  X  D  X  1 AF . According to the analysis for the ` 2 , 1 norm in [15], if we define  X  ( x ) = k P k 2 , 1 with P n i =1  X  ( k p i k 2 ). Thus, based on Lemma 1, the objective function of Eq. (4) can be reformulated as follows: Algorithm 1 Harmonic Modularity (HAM) Input: G = ( V,E ), m , k Output: Assignments to m communities and the top-k SH 1: Initialize F 0 s.t. F T 0 F 0 = I m , t  X  0; 2: while not converge do 3: Set Q t  X  Diag ( 1 4: Compute R t according to Eq. (8) 5: Compute F t +1 as the eigenvectors of R t correspond-6: t  X  t + 1; 7: end while 8: Sort each node according to k f k 2 in ascending order 9: Remove the top-k SH spanners from F , and then cluster where Q = Diag ( q ), and q is an auxiliary vector of the ` norm. The elements of q are computed as follows. where is a smoothing term that avoids division by zero, which is usually set to be a small constant value (we set = 10  X  4 in this paper).

Clearly, the optimal solution of (6) can be computed via solving the eigenvector problem for the matrix: Based on the above analysis, we summarize the detailed op-timization algorithm in Algorithm 1.
The Algorithm 1 to optimize Eq. (4) is presented from line 2 to line 7. We prove that it converges to the optimal solution F . We begin with the following Lemma [24]. Lemma 2. For any nonzero vectors v i t  X  R c , 1  X  i  X  r , where r is an arbitrary number. The following inequality holds:
X Proof. The detailed proof can be found in the work [24].
Next, we show that the iterative algorithm shown in Al-gorithm 1 converges by the following theorem.
 Theorem 3. The iterative approach in Algorithm 1 (line 2 to line 7) monotonically decreases the objective function value of min Proof. Let  X  = I n  X  D  X  1 A , then P =  X  X  . In line 5 of Algorithm 1, we can see that Therefore, we have Then according to Lemma 2, P i k p i t +1 k 2  X  P i k p P i k p Based on the definition of ` 2 , 1 norm and P = F  X  D  X  1 we can obtain which indicates that the value of min monotonically decreases using the updating rule in Algo-rithm 1.

According to Theorem 3, we can see that the iterative approach in Algorithm 1 converges to local optimal F corre-sponding to Eq. (4). The proposed optimization algorithm is efficient. In the experiment, we observe that our algorithm usually converges around only 20 iterations.

The complexity is briefly discussed as follows. The com-plexity of computing Q is O ( n 2 ). To obtain F , we need to conduct eigendecomposition of R , which is O ( n 3 ) in com-plexity. It can be reduced to O ( n 2 . 376 ) using the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm. The complexity of identifying commu-nities by K -means is O ( m 2 nt ), where t is the iterative index required for K -means to converge. The complexity of top-k SH spanner selection is O ( n log( n ) + nm ).
Here we present the special case of our HAM method and relate it to the existing works. These different viewpoints provide a rich and complementary set of techniques for rea-soning about this approach to the joint community and SH spanner detection problem.

Perhaps the most interesting and significant aspect of HAM is that it can be viewed as a direct response to the harmonic property. As we use the ` 2 , 1 norm to push the community indicators of SH spanners shrink to zero, this equals to re-move SH spanners from the graph. Thus, in our method, the value of the objective function is close to zero, which is consistent with the notion of harmony . Moreover, one can see if there are no cross edges or SH spanners in the network, then the auxiliary matrix Q is always constant, regardless of any changes of community indicator F . In this case, we will solve the minimum Frobenius norm residual problem ( i.e. , min k F  X  D  X  1 AF k F , s.t. F T F = I m ), and HAM degener-ates into the random walk approach (also called harmonic function learning) [31].

Our HAM uses the eigenvectors of a matrix ( R in Eq. (8)) to reveal the community structure in the graph, therefore it can be regarded as belonging to the category of spectral clus-tering approaches. However, there are two major differences. The matrix whose eigenvectors are used for clustering plays the key role in spectral clustering. In HAM, this matrix is computed based on the harmonic function learning idea in conjunction with the sparsity-inducing ` 2 , 1 -norm, while conventional spectral clustering methods are often based on the graph Laplacian matrices. Second, spectral clustering gives a closed-form solution, and HAM needs to be opti-mized in a half-quadratic way. In practice, the main compu-tational load of HAM and spectral clustering is to compute the eigenvectors, therefore they have the same order of time complexity.
To evaluate the effectiveness of HAM, we conduct exten-sive experiments on real-world social networks, and com-pare them with various baseline methods. As there hardly exist comparative methods that can simultaneously detect communities and SH spanners, we compare our approach to community detection and SH spanner detection methods, respectively. Since the quality of detected communities can be well affected by the spotted SH spanners, we first investi-gate the effectiveness of HAM on SH spanner detection. We then study the performance of HAM on community detec-tion. Finally, we discuss the results and the reasons behind them.
We adopt three real-world social network datasets from different contexts. The DBLP and YouTube data were obtained from [37]. We sample 5 datasets from each and measure the average performance. Since we focus on detecting distinct commu-nities, the communities of interest should not have too much overlaps with other communities. We compute the number of cross edges between each pair of communities, and di-vide it by the number of nodes in the smaller community as the cross ratio between the community pair. The sampling rule is: randomly pick a community, and then take all the nodes within the community if the cross ratios between the picked community and the existing selected communities is less than a threshold (set as 0 . 3 in the experiment). We re-peat the sampling process until the number of nodes or the number of communities in the sampled network reaches a predefined limit (set as 2 , 000 and 20, respectively, in the ex-periment) or no more community to be picked. Table 2 sum-marizes the original datasets and also the sampled datasets for the large networks.
We compare HAM with the following seven state-of-the-art methods, each of which represents a different strategy for detecting the top-k SH spanners.

Currently there is no standard criteria available for eval-uating the performance of the top-k SH spanners. Here we base on simulating the information diffusion process [12] in the given network to evaluate the performance. Since a SH spanner usually dominates the spread of information across communities, when using the more effective SH spanner as a seed (source) node, the faster the information would be diffused to different communities. Hence, the number of the influenced outsiders, which are the ones reside in the com-munities different from the SH spanner X  X  community, should be larger. However, the number of outsiders is related to the size of the given community. Further, considering a well connected node in the center of a community can also prop-agate its influence to other communities through its neigh-bors, simply relying on the number of influenced outsiders may not be able to discriminate SH spanners from center nodes. Thus, to give a evaluation criterion that is suitable for a variety of SH spanners and can distinguish SH span-ners from center nodes, we consider the proposition of the number of the influenced outsiders to the total number of all the influenced nodes. Formally, we define the structural hole influence index under a certain diffusion model as the evaluation criterion. In this study, we use two different and widely used informa-tion diffusion models [17]: Linear Threshold (LT) model and Independent Cascade (IC) model to find the set of influenced nodes. Since it is unlikely to simulate the information diffu-sion procedure using only one seed, for the given SH spanner Figure 2: Visualization of the identified SH span-ners in Karate Club, where the large blue shadowed nodes represent SH Spanners discovered by HAM. candidate, we randomly select a certain number (5% of the number of the nodes that are in the same community as the candidate) of the candidate X  X  neighbors along with the candidate as the seed set in the LT/IC model. For each SH spanner candidate, we repeat the random selection for 1,000 times and run the LT and IC models for 100,000 times for each selected seed set. Finally, we report the average SHII for each method.
Table 3 reports the performance of each method in terms of the proposed evaluation criterion. From the results, we can observe that HAM significantly outperforms all the other baseline methods even the supervised methods ( i.e. , MaxD and HIS), which are aware of the ground truth of the com-munities. Specifically, it can be seen in the DBLP data that the SHII achieved by HAM under the LT model is 5 . 384, which is more than 5 times higher than that obtained by BC and HIS, about 10 times larger than that achieved by Constraint, PageRank, 2-Step, MaxD, and AP BICC.

For qualitative analysis, in Figure 2, we visualize the net-work of Karate Club using the tool Networkx [14] and mark the identified SH spanners by HAM to see the topological position of them. The nodes with large blue shadow are the top-3 SH spanners spotted and the colors of nodes indicate the different communities they belong to. The results of the other methods are listed in Table 3. We can find that HAM captures the most intermediate nodes between com-munities. In contrast, most of the compared methods take the nodes with the highest degree as SH spanners, but actu-ally these nodes are usually the center of the communities. It obviously contradicts to the definition of SH spanners. Although HIS does not focus on finding the nodes with the highest degree, its identified SH spanners have less impact on the information diffusion across different communities, as can be seen that HIS has smaller values of SHII than all the other methods. We apply the results of identified top-k SH spanners by HAM to help predict community structure. To further show the effectiveness of the identified SH spanners, we evalu-ate the community detection performance before and after removing the top-k SH spanners for each comparative meth-ods. When considering all the nodes in the network as the prediction object, in our HAM method, for each SH spanner we determine its community label via majority voting using its connected nodes X  community labels.
We compare HAM with the following commonly used al-gorithms for community detection.
In order to evaluate the quality of the communities gener-ated by different community detection approaches, we adopt the following measures. a) Accuracy ( ACC ) is one of the most frequently used b) Normalized Mutual Information ( NMI ) measures the c) Average Cluster Entropy (ACE) is based on the impu-
Table 4 summarizes the performance of different methods according to three evaluation criteria. The performance be-fore removing the top-k SH spanners (with top-k SH span-ners) are shown in the left column and without top-k SH spanners in the right column. From the left column of Ta-ble 4 it can be seen that the performance of each method on different datasets can be quite different. However, the best method that outperforms other methods in all datasets is HAM, especially for DBLP and YouTube datasets. We can see the accuracies achieved by HAM (0 . 879 and 0 . 953, respectively) are considerably larger than the second best method (0 . 790 and 0 . 888, respectively). Moreover, HAM sig-nificantly outperforms RW, which means that the sparsity-inducing ` 2 , 1 -norm is effective to increase the harmony within the community. From the right column of Table 4, we can see the performance of each comparative method substan-tially benefits from the removal of top-k SH spanners. For example, the accuracy performance of SP is improved from 0 . 693 to 0 . 872 on the DBLP dataset. These results suggest that our proposed method can guarantee to find more posi-tive structural hole spanners connecting to different commu-nities, and removing them makes the community structure more apparent, thus facilitating better community detection performance. We now turn to the discussion of the experimental results. Table 3 shows HAM is substantially better than other SH spanner detection methods. The reason is that HAM finds the SH spanners who bridge different communities, while most other methods detect the SH spanners with higher degree, which collaborate with many nodes in their own community. In other words, structural hole spanners are more likely to connect the nodes between communities than higher-degree nodes. Thus they have great potentials to control information flow between communities. Moreover, the left column of Table 4 shows the community detection performance gain of HAM over other methods is significant. This result is due to the absence of SH spanners in our origi-nal community detection procedure. Removing SH spanners helps make the community structure more tangible such that different communities are easier to be separated. As can be seen in the right column of Table 4, the performance of each comparative method is improved after removing the identi-fied top-k SH spanners detected by HAM.
 In addition, Figure 3 shows convergence curves of HAM. From this figure, we can see that the proposed optimization algorithm converges quickly in the vicinity of the minimum, i.e. , only around 20 iterations. At the same time, it can also be seen from Figure 3 that the objective function converges to a very small value, which is consistent with intuitive in-terpretation of SH spanner selection process. Furthermore, our method needs no parameter tuning, which makes it even more appealing.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to si-multaneously address the problems of community detection and SH spanner detection. Our work is related to both com-munity detection techniques and SH spanners mining. We briefly discuss both of them.
Community detection, with its root in graph partitioning and graph clustering, has been pivotal to network science. A plethora of algorithms have been presented to address this task over the years, be it cut-based [9], spectrum-based [23], modularity-based [22], or information theoretic [29]. To cover all community detection algorithms is beyond the scope of this paper, and interested readers can refer to the survey papers such as [10].

In recent years, a variety of methods inspired by different paradigms are put forward for community detection [35]. A prominent one is to consider the structural roles of individ-ual nodes. This desideratum is motivated by the observation on many real-world networks that, by nature, community and structural role discovery are interdependent and com-plementary to each other. Real-world communities often contain nodes with various roles for it to function, such as ones that interface with other communities and ones that are peripheral to community cores. On the other hand, the role assignment of a node also depends on the communities that the node itself, its neighbors and beyond belong to. There-fore, there exists a strong and crucial need to detect com-munities and roles jointly. Recent work has leveraged role detection techniques for community detection [30]. None of those methods, however, consider the SH spanner detection.
Structural Hole theory is first introduced by [4] to find the key employees in organizations for integrating operations across functional and business boundaries. A series of em-pirical studies [3, 27] have demonstrated that advantages ac-crue to SH spanners who occupy bridging positions between different communities. In the literature, many strategies [13, 18] have been devised to model the property of structural holes in a network. [13] proposed a network formation model that a vertex serves as an intermediary between many ver-tices. The strategic link formation in their model leads to a star network, while real-world networks are not necessary of the star topology.

In recent years, several approaches have been proposed to find the top-k SH spanners. [13] formulated SH spanners as nodes that reside on large number of shortest paths between different pairs of nodes. Because counting all the shortest paths is time-consuming, [32] proposed a 2-Step approach that only counts the number of shortest paths with length two. Most recently, [28] viewed the SH spanners as a set of vertices whose removal will result in the maximum increase on the mean distance of the network, which is the average of the lengths of all pairs of vertices in the network. They then proposed the AP BICC model, by exploiting the bounded inverse closeness centrality (BICC) of vertices and making use of articulation points (AP) of the network.

To our best knowledge, there is only one paper that uti-lized the community information for mining the top-k SH spanners [20], which assumes the communities are given. One instantiation of their proposed model is to find a set of vertices whose removal leads to the maximum decrease in the minimum cut in the given set of communities. However, communities usually are not known in most scenarios, thus the quality of the solution relies on the quality of communi-ties found. In contrast, given only the topological structure of the network, our proposed HAM can detect the commu-nities and the top-k SH spanners simultaneously. Further-more, as demonstrated in the experiment, HAM captures the most influential intermediate nodes between communi-ties, while most of the previous methods take the nodes in the center of the communities as SH spanners.
In this work, we proposed a novel Harmonic Modular-ity (HAM) method for simultaneously detecting the poten-tial communities and the top-k SH spanners, using only the topological structure of the network. Specifically, we ap-plied the harmonic function analysis to measure the har-monic modularity and to obtain the community indicator. We further investigated the sparsity level of the interactions between communities, with particular emphasis on the nodes connecting to multiple communities, to discriminate the in-dicator of SH spanners and assist the community guidance. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world social networks demonstrated that HAM can capture the charac-teristics of structural hole spanners, and the proposed algo-rithm significantly outperform several comparative methods (even the methods using the supervised community infor-mation) in the top-k SH spanner identification problem and also the community detection problem, respectively.
