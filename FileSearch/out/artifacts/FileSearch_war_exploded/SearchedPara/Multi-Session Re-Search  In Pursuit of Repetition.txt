 Search engine users regularly re-issue queries that are the same or similar to ones they have previously issued. In this paper we study this act of query re-issuing, called re-search, focusing on multi session re-searching from an information seeking perspective. By focusing on the series of repeat or similar queries where the user shows a continued interest, new patterns of behavior not previously seen arise. We find that the well-studied re-finding behavior is only a piece of the re-search puzzle, and that even amidst repeated re-findings users exhibit diversification and novelty seeking behaviours for many re-search queries. This suggests diversity and re-finding behaviors should be jointly modelled and captured in evaluation measures, instead of being studied as two sep-arate problems as is seen in many previous approaches.

Many information needs cannot be satisfied in a single ses-sion. A politician concerned with her image may be inter-ested in her approval rating throughout the election cycle. Any new potential scandal or opinion piece is relevant to her, and she may query for herself frequently. Alternatively, a cancer patient may wish to investigate new treatments and may seek new information to augment what she has previ-ously learned. As she embarks on her information journey, she may return to past sites as her understanding grows, or visit new sites to gain additional information. In both cases, the interest in the given query is persistent and ongoing. A successful search during any given session does not negate the need to search again in the future. Where the politician may benefit from a broad diversification of search results the cancer patient would benefit from a more targeted approach.
These repeated searches can reveal a deeper insight into the user X  X  interests. If the cancer patient has already decided against a method of treatment, she may be unwilling to con-sider it further and ignore search results on that topic. A conspiracy theorist may only click search results that sup-ports his theories. This is sometimes called biased search for information in psychology[17] and is a form of confir-mation bias . Such a subset of search result topics a user is interested in may evolve over time. While researches have modelled user interests, incorporating the study of re-search could offer a more nuanced understanding for a very specific, and often searched for topic for a given user.

This paper studies ongoing re-search queries from an in-formation seeking perspective, examining on-going related searches as a series and their effects on the information need, rather than on each query individually. We find that long term ongoing re-search often shows signs of both diversifi-cation seeking and repetition seeking behaviors within the same trail and that while seeking new content, users would benefit from personalized diversification of search results.
Our work draws on three areas of past research: the study of information seeking in task based search, query reuse by individuals, and drifting of the query intention.

Information Seeking. In the field of digital libraries, researchers have studied the way in which users engage in information searches, including as a series of searches related to the same task or need [13, 18, 6]. Adams and Blandford [1] studied the information journey of users, finding the jour-ney generally included three stages: information initiation, facilitation and interpretation. They argued for increased support in interoperating multiple sources of information. D  X  ork et al. [9] proposed a model for information seeking based on urban flaneur, designed to aid in the interpretation of gathered information. Liu and Belkin [15] found that the usefulness of the document was strongly correlated to the stage the user was in. Similar observations have been made by Vakkari et al. [26], who found users adapt and improve over multiple stages. In Vakkari et al. study subjects were experienced searchers with domain level expertise. Warwick et al. [28] studied how expertise in information seeking de-velops and found that users with less prior knowledge were reluctant to change their established search strategies, rely-ing on keyword searches even when ineffective. In these prior works the task was given and users were free to formulate queries. We study the same query and how the intention behind it may drift to accommodate the user X  X  task.
Query Reuse. Prior work has studied query reissuing by individuals when interacting with a search engine [2, 19, 22]. Repetitive queries have also been studied to aid in col-laborative search [20, 4], clustering [29] for query recommen-dation [3, 31] as well as in support of page re-visitation and search resumption [21, 16]. These works generally focused on individual queries and query pairs. Tyler and Teevan [24] included analysis of re-finding chains in their work, finding that users often settle on a query when re-finding. Since they focused on re-finding rather than re-searching, they included non-similar query issues and omitted new URL findings for the same query in their analysis.

Drifting of the Query Intention. Query dynamics, and the temporal nature of queries have been studied across users [27, 5, 8]. The types of temporal patterns associ-ated with various queries are linked to retrieval performance. There is a transient nature to some information needs. For example, a query for  X  X orld cup soccer X  may be in reference to different events in different years. During the event, a user may wish to see the current standings, or an update on a score, whereas in the off season the user may be seek-ing more general information about the sport. With this in mind, temporal aspects in web page content have been used to re-rank search results [30, 23]. In this paper, we study query click changes on an individual level, rather than on the macro scale and observe changes over the course of sessions, not just weeks or months.
A query, q j , is an example of re-search if it is similar to another query, q i , previously issued by the same user. The queries q i and q j form a re-search trail . A new query, q added to a trail, T , if  X  q  X  T where q k ' q . In this paper we only consider long multi-session re-search trails; trails with at least four separate query instances that span at least two sessions. These query instances may be abandoned. We use the terms new-findings and re-findings to mean a new or repeat URL click relative to the trail, and not the full user X  X  search history. This definition differs from the literature.
Based on the literature, we study three types of re-search in this paper, same query ,  X  = , minimal change query ,  X  and term overlap query ,  X  T where, same query  X  minimal change query  X  term overlap query . We consider a re-search to be similar according to the most specific similarity metric, and the full trail to be similar according to the most specific similarity of all re-searchings within the trail. For example, for a minimal change re-search trail T ,  X  q i , q j  X  T, q and  X  q k , q l  X  T, q k 6 X  = q l .

Same Query (  X  = ). Two queries are an example of same query re-search if the query strings are identical.
Minimal Change Query (  X  M ). In keeping with previ-ous work [22, 24, 25], queries are similar according to min-imal change if the types of differences between the query strings do not tend to affect the meaning of the query. Such differences include stop words, white spaces, non-alphanumerics, URL identifiers such as  X  X ww. X  and  X .com X  (called domain variants [22, 24]), casing, or term ordering. Thus the strings  X  X hurch of Latter Day Saints X  and  X  X atter Day Saints church X  are considered to be a minimal change of each other. Prior work has also included spelling mistakes, acronyms, syn-onyms and merging of terms in the definition of minimally different. We omit these from our definition since the transi-tivity property of the similarity metric would no longer hold, as a query term may be an acronym or a misspelling of two distinct phrases with different meanings.

Term Overlap Query (  X  T ). In some instances the query may be modified by adding or removing terms [14, 12, 10] including for retrieval of the same URL [10]. Two queries are considered to be similar according to term over-lap if their Jaccard similarity is strictly greater than 0.5, and thus at least half their terms are shared. As before, case, stop words, non-alphanumerics, and URL identifiers are ig-nored. Such terms generally make up a small portion of the query and rarely affect the similarity.While the transitive property no longer holds for term overlap similarity, term overlap better captures the notion of an evolving query and evolving information need during the information journey.
User Survey. We begin with a Mechanical Turk sur-vey conducted on 23 males and 39 females from 12 to 67 years old across the United States. The survey included several control questions that were basic rephrasals of each other. Participants whose responses were incongruent, such as reporting very different frequencies for the same behavior, were automatically discarded. While Mechanical Turk par-ticipants may not be a representative sample of web users in general, their reported search behaviors are similar to those observed from the logs.

Participants were asked to identify their intentions behind re-issuing a query including: (1) to revisit a website you have seen before (2) to find new websites you have not seen before (3) to find new information, regardless of whether it is on a website you have seen before (4) and to see if or how the search results have changed. In our analysis we refer to these four intentions as  X  X e-finding X ,  X  X ew finding X ,  X  X ew content seeking X  and  X  X esult list change X  respectively. Re-finding can be viewed as repetition seeking as the user was first and foremost seeking a previously found URL, even though the URL may contain new content. Similarly new-finding and new content seeking could be seen as diversification seeking. When intentionally re-finding a user may benefit from the result list to remain unchanged, whereas for the other inten-tions modifications to the result list may be more beneficial. Search Logs. We use two search logs for our analysis.
The AOL search log, referred to as the English search log contains 27M distinct queries issued by 650k users between March 2006 to May 2006. We define a session boundary as 30 minutes of inactivity, as motivated by prior work [7]. Jones and Klinker found the time based sessions cannot separate all tasks into separate sessions regardless of time interval length [11]. Our intent is to explore the notion of evolving, incomplete or ongoing tasks (e.g. the information journey), therefore we wish to exclude from our analysis only short tasks where the query is re-issued during only a brief period of time. Thus we expect this definition of session is adequate for our study.

The second log, Sogou, is primarily in Chinese contain-ing 10.8 million queries issued by 5M users from August 2006. Due to the characteristics of the Chinese language it is not straightforward to incorporate the concept of term overlap or minimal change similarities. Thus we only con-Figure 1: User Study Participant Responses: (a) How many previously issued queries he or she planned to issue again in the future and (b) the typ-ical intentions in issuing the re-search query. sider same-query re-search. The Sogou dataset is ordered by time, without timestamps. We approximately define cross-session re-searching as those with at least five queries issued between a re-search and the previous issue of the query. The more queries issued, the more likely the user is expressing a renewed interest in the re-search query.

One weakness of the AOL search log is that it only con-tains the domains of clicked search result URLs, whereas the Sogou log contains the full URLs. We conducted our analysis on the Sogou log twice, once with only the domain information and once with the full URL of a click, finding the results are often similar. Thus using only the domain information, as with the English log, may be sufficient for our purposes. Unless otherwise noted, all search log findings are on the English search log.
Re-searching is common and often intentional. All par-ticipants of the survey reported re-searching multiple times over multiple days, with 25 participants (40%) re-searching at least once a day. Almost all participants had at least one query they intended to re-search again at some point in the future, while 36 participants (58%) had 5 or more queries, and 9 participants (15%) had more than 20 (Figure 1 a). In the English search log, 39.5% of all query instances were same query re-searches and 55.1% of same query re-searches were re-searched again. Long trails were common with 43.8% of trails consisted of at least five queries.
The survey participants X  intentions behind re-issuing the same query are shown in Figure 1 (b). Re-finding (repeti-tion seeking) was the most common intention, followed by searching for new content and new-finding (diversity seek-ing). Participants also reported having multiple intentions for the same query string including to both re-find and new-find (40 participants), re-find and find new content (38 par-ticipants) and new-find and find new content (29 partici-pants). Thus there appears to be a dual need for repetition and diversity within the same re-search trail.

A combination of diversity seeking and repetition seeking behaviours within the trail can also be observed in the En-glish search log. Of same query re-search trails of length 5, 52.7% contain both re-findings and new-findings. Only 37.7% include only re-findings (i.e. are repetition seeking Table 1: A re-search trail in the English log for the query  X  X live Owen X  issued over 32 days.
 Figure 2: Percentage of trails that have dominant URLs. only) while 9.6% of the trails contain only new-findings (i.e. are diversity seeking only).
Re-finding and new-finding often occur together through-out the trail. Consider the re-search trail for the query  X  X live owen X  from the English search log (Table 1). While the user frequently visits http://imdb.com , he or she does not settle on it, clicking other URLs throughout the trail. We refer to the URL most frequently clicked on within the trail as the Dominant URL . Thus there can be only one dominant URL per trail. In this section we only consider the clicked queries in the trail, and trails with at least four clicked queries.
The Chinese log shows a high correlation between domi-nant URLs and the most frequently clicked on domain in a trail. In the Chinese log, 80.0% of trails have a dominant URL. For 94.0% of the these trails, the dominant URL is the only URL clicked on in the trail from the corresponding domain. Additionally, for 98.5% of re-search trails where a domain is clicked on more frequently than any other (i.e. is a dominant domain), the trail also has a dominant URL, and that dominant URL corresponds to said domain. Therefore, when a dominant domain is observed in a re-search trail as in the English search log, it is likely the trail also has a dom-inant URL. Regardless, a dominant domain is still worth noting, as it may also hold a strong level of user interest.
Dominant URLs are common in trails for all similarity metrics and data sets (Figure 2), even though the defini-tion of term overlap similarity was designed to incorporate a potential drifting information need. In the English log, 75.9% of same query, 83.9% of minimal change, and 78.9% of term overlap trails have dominant URLs. We find that these dominant URLs often account for at least half of all repeat URL clicks in the trail regardless of the ratio of new-finding to re-finding. For same query re-search, dominant URLs account for 53.1% of all URL clicks, and 84.6% of all repeat URL clicks.
 Re-Finding and New-Finding Appear Intentional
Given prior emphasis on re-finding in the literature, one might expect that the intention of the user is to re-find the dominant URL, and thus expect the user to settle on the dominant URL. If this were true, most of the new URL clicks would appear at the beginning of the trail. Contrary to the notion of settling, more same query re-search trails have new URL clicks in the final 25% of queries than the inital 25% of queries (27.8% and 10.3% respectively.) An additional 39.0% of trails have new findings throughout the trail. Therefore most re-search trails cannot be explained by the notion that the user is settling on a URL.

If the URL click was unintentional, we might expect the user to re-issue the query again in the near future. Yet for only 4.9% of same query re-searching the query was re-issued again in under a minute after a new-finding, and in 51.6% of those instances is the re-issue the next query. Thus while in some cases the new URL click may have been a mistake, we cannot assume this is true for all re-searching resulting in new URL clicks.
While we consider only multi-session trails in this paper, a multi-session trail can contain instances of same-session re-searching. A URL is a Persistent URL if it is present in half the sessions from the re-search trail, and thus the user shows a persistent interest in the URL. A URL can be a persistent URL and not a dominant URL and vice versa. Of same query re-search trails 16.5% have more than one persistent URL. The mean average number of persistent URLs for all trails was 2.3 for same query, 1.79 for minimal change, and 2.05 for term overlap re-search trails. Examples include news (e.g.  X  X as vegas news X ), shopping (e.g.  X 2007 honda crv X ,  X  X iscount bridesmaids dresses X ), and sports and entertainment (e.g.  X  X reen bay packers X ).

One difficulty the information journey as outlined by Adams and Blandford [1] is interpreting information from multiple sources. In some cases where the user has multiple persis-tent URLs, the user may be comparing or contrasting their content on his or her own. These multiple persistent URLs may complement each other, such as a local school newspa-per and a township paper, or offer contrary perspectives.
The most common difficulty associated with re-searching reported by user survey participants was irrelevant results they felt did not match the query, followed by not useful results that did not match their need and not enough results. Figure 3: The percentage of skipped search results over the full re-search trail in the English search log. This shows a need to improve diversification in the search results for re-searches.
 Selective Nature in Diversification Seeking
To get an idea of how selective users are within a research trail, we look at the proportion of URLs clicked over the course of the trail. In order to filter out navigational queries, we consider only re-search trails with at least three differ-ent clicked URLs. We estimate the number of non-clicked URLs by counting the non-clicked ranks across the query instances for a given user X  X  re-search trail, considering only result ranks higher (and thus closer to the top of the result page) than the deepest clicked result. While the search re-sults may differ for different instances of the same query, in the English log 92.7% of same query re-search trails do not involve two clicked domains at the same rank for the same user. The result lists can still change in ways undetectable in the log, such as at non clicked ranks. Thus our estimation of the number of skipped results is likely to be conservative.
We see from Figure 3 that users are often selective. In 24.1% of research trails 80% of the search results are skipped. For only 10.8% of same query re-search trails users are not selective, eventually clicking on all search results up to a certain depth. It may be the case that the most relevant URLs may already be at the top of the result list, or the user may be more affected by the click position bias for the given query. The Chinese dataset shows a similar numbers of selective users with 22.4% of trails having 60-80% skipped search results, while 19.7% have 80% or more skipped re-sults.
 Personalized Diversification Seeking
In the English search log, the probability of two users having a non-dominant URL in common for the same re-search query is 9.1%. If the users also have a dominant URL in common, the conditional probability increases to 9.6%. Surprisingly, a non-dominant URL provides more predictive capability than the dominant URL. If two users with the same re-search query have a non-dominant URL in com-mon, they are 17.8% likely to have another non-dominant URL in common. If they also have a dominant URL in com-mon, the conditional probability increases to 22.7%. Thus the non-dominant URLs that are less frequently clicked on by definition are more informative as to what other non-dominant URLs a user may click on. Since the click entropy in the dominant URLs per re-search is lower than the click entropy in the non-dominant URLs (0.73 vs 1.53), it may be the case that two users with slightly different interests in the same query may still share the same dominant URL. Knowing at least one non-dominant URL the users share in common may help reduce this uncertainty. This supports the notion that users may only be interested in specific sub-sets of the non-dominant URLs.

The results of our log analysis show that many users en-gaged in re-search do not click on all results, and do not click on non-dominant URLs randomly. This finding, along with the feedback from the user study, show that in many cases a user may not be interested in all forms of diversification.
While the search log file may be old, and there have been improvements to search engines since then, the user survey confirms that (1) re-searching is still prevalent, (2) re-search consists of both repetition and diversification seeking be-haviors and (3) that users still experience challenges while engaging in re-search. A search engine could take advantage of a user X  X  repetitive queries, by exploring the non-dominant URLs for the given query and tailor the search results to the particular user in order to better satisfy the user X  X  informa-tion need. The search engine might be able to provide a per-sonalized trade off between diversity/novelty and re-finding. This work is supported by the National Science Foundation Fellowship and IIS-0953908.
