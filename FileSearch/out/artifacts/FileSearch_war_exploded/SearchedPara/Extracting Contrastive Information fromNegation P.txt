The phenomenon of negation is generally considered troublesome in natural language processing due to the overwhelming complexity of the form and the function of sentences with negation. Moreover, the meanings of negative ex-pressions such as  X  X ot X  and  X  X o X  in English do not always correspond to that of the basic logical operator for negation, which simply reverses the truth value of the nonnegated original [Horn 1989]. Nevertheless, we find that expressions of negation, especially the negative  X  X ot, X  in the biomedical literature often employ predictable syntactic structures that are characterized by subclausal coordination and by clause-level parallelism [cf. Mutalik et al. 2001]. Consider (1) and (2) below. 1 (1) TGA2.1 and TGA2.2 , but not TGA1a , interacted with ankyrin repeat pro-(2) We show that the sequence of eIF2beta homologous to aIF2beta is sufficient
Notice that both examples include the negative  X  X ot, X  but that they also express information of contrast. 2 We show that such contrastive information can be exploited to identify the crucial differences between the properties of the objects that are so contrasted. For instance, the sentences in (2) together express a contrast between two proteins eIF2beta and eIF5. The observation here would be that, although their sequences are similar, eIF2beta, but not eIF5, binds to eIF2gamma. Notice that the structures of this kind of information are similar to focus-presupposition constructions [Prince 1992], in the sense that the property the involved objects do not have in common is a variable-containing, or  X  X pen, X  proposition, as schematized in (3a) below, where some of the objects, but not the others, can be instantiations of the variable X, as illustrated in (3b). (3) (a) X binds to eIF2gamma
Henceforth, we will call the objects involved in a contrast as focused objects and the unshared properties as presupposed properties . 3
A possible hypothesis concerning contrastive information is that such information provides insights into the nature of those focused objects. From the information in (2), for example, we may infer that the subdomain of eIF2beta that actually interacts with, or at least plays an important role in binding to, eIF2gamma is located in the region that is not shared by eIF5 [Thompson et al. 2000]. Another hypothesis is that such contrastive informa-tion between proteins of the same protein family may lead to a meaningful subcategorization of the protein family by those presupposed properties. For example, the presupposed property of binding to eIF2gamma may work as a clue to subcategorization of the Gene Ontology term  X  X ranslation initiation factor activity X  (GO:0003743) [The Gene Ontology Consortium 2004], to which the proteins eIF2beta and eIF5 belong. This intuition may also lead to the use of contrasts for the purpose of preventing incorrect generalization that applies a property to all the members of the same protein family when there is a contrast consisting of the property and some members of the family.
Despite the potential significance of such contrastive information, however, existing proteome databases do not provide fields (or tuples) for such infor-mation between proteins. For example, protein interaction databases such as
BIND [Bader et al. 2003] and DIP [Xenarios et al. 2002] do not include negated interactions, such as  X  X  does not interact with B, X  possibly because a single negated interaction is far less informative than a positive equivalent. sequence databases such as Swiss-Prot [Boeckmann et al. 2003] and InterPro have a small number of protein entries whose comments or abstracts include contrastive information as shown in (4). 5 (4) FUNCTION: Inhibits activity of protein phosphatase 2A . Does not inhibit
Nonetheless, such information is quite abundant in the biomedical literature such as MEDLINE. Hence, we propose to augment the existing proteome data-bases by extracting contrastive information from MEDLINE abstracts.
There have been many approaches to information extraction from the biomedical literature, but only a few have dealt with negated information. Ono and colleagues utilize two negation patterns, such as those in (5), in order to extract negated interactions between proteins as well [Ono et al. 2001]. (5) (a) PROTEIN1.* not (interact | associate | bind | complex).* PROTEIN2
Mutalik and colleagues describe a program, called Negfinder, that recognizes negative expressions that occur in dictated medical documents and then records the presence or absence of negation of each concept that is identified in the doc-uments [Mutalik et al. 2001]. The program, developed for concept indexing for medical documents, works with manually constructed rules that consist of single words ( X  X o, X   X  X ithout, X   X  X egative X ) or complex phrases ( X  X o evidence of, X   X  X ould not be currently identified X ). They appear to have comprehensively ex-amined the nature of negation in the medical documents, including homonyms, lexical constraints, grammatical constraints on local contexts, and coordina-tion, although they have not considered grammatical and discourse-related variations of expressions for concepts [cf. Kim and Park 2004a]. However, both approaches did not consider the extraction of contrastive information encoded by negation in the literature.

We propose to extract contrastive information from the biomedical literature with the help of syntactically well-formed structures as described in Section 2.1. This proposal is different from the linguistic analysis of the complexity for the meanings and scopes of negation in the general domain and also from the practical applications of identification of negated facts from the biomedical lit-erature. We also show that such information has a biological significance over the proper understanding of the biological event in question and also for subcat-egorization of protein families, as explained in Section 2.2. We present a method for extracting contrastive information with natural language processing tech-niques and with additional linguistic resources for semantics in Section 3 and present experimental results in Section 4. 2. DATA ANALYSIS
In this section, we describe both linguistic structures and biological meanings of the expressions for contrastive information that are represented with the neg-ative  X  X ot X  in a training corpus. 8 The training corpus consists of 154 sentences from 116 MEDLINE abstracts extracted with the MeSH terms  X  X east protein interaction. X  Each such sentence contains the negative  X  X ot X  at least once and also contains interaction keywords, such as,  X  X nteract, X   X  X ind, X   X  X ctivate, X  and  X  X nhibit, X  adapted from Kim and Park [2004b]. 2.1 Linguistic Aspects
The contrastive information usually consists of two or more focused objects along with a presupposed property in which only some, but not the others, of the focused objects are involved. For example, out of the two focused proteins in the sentence (2), only eIF2beta can be associated with the biological event  X  X nteraction with eIF2gamma. X  The protein corresponding to the Swiss-Prot entry name AN32E HUMAN in the comment (4) is involved in the biological event  X  X nhibition of protein phosphatase 2A, X  but not in the event  X  X nhibition of protein phosphatase 1. X 
The linguistic expressions with the negative  X  X ot X  that represent contrastive information mostly form predictable syntactic structures, including subclausal coordination and clause-level parallelism. For example, the negative  X  X ot X  is often expressed with a coordinating conjunction, such as  X  X ut X  and  X , X  as illus-trated in example (6). (6) Second, Pcf11p , but not Rna15p , is shown to directly contact phosphory-
In addition, a clause with  X  X ot X  may show parallelism with another clause in the same sentence, where the two clauses are often connected with a subordinate conjunction such as  X  X hile X  and  X  X hereas, X  shown in (7). (7) Mot1 N-terminal deletions (residues 25-801) abolished TBP binding,
Similarly, there may be some parallelism between adjacent sentences, where one sentence, but not the other, contains  X  X ot, X  as shown in the example (8). (8) These results suggest that the Sld3-Cdc45 complex associates with replica-
There are also other structures with  X  X ot. X  For example, the sentence (9) shows an analogous pattern,  X  X ot only A but also B, X  which indicates an analogy between (biological) objects. (9) The temperature-sensitive sld3 mutation confers a defect in DNA repli-
Also, (10) shows an analogy with the combination of the negative  X  X ot X  and the verb  X  X iffer. X  (10) Farnesylated wild-type PEX19p and a farnesylation-deficient mutant
In addition to those structures that indicate relationships between biological objects, sentence (11) with the adverbial phrase  X  X o date, X  as well as with the negative  X  X ot, X  explains the background of the work in the paper by describing what has  X  X ot X  been done. (11) To date , a requirement for auxilin and Hsc70 in clathrin function in vivo
Of course, there are other occurrences of the negative  X  X ot X  in the training cor-pus, which cannot simply be classified into such semantic categories as contrast, analogy, and background, as exemplified in (12). (12) By mapping the domains in six iPMPs that interact with Pex19p and
Based on the observation that 113 occurrences of  X  X ot X  (72%) among 158 oc-currences in the training corpus show contrasts and that only 18 occurrences (11%) show analogies, as depicted in Table I, we choose to focus on extraction of contrastive information in this paper. As subclausal coordination and clause-level parellelism are the most prevalent syntactic structures of the negative  X  X ot, X  as depicted in Table II, 10 we also aim to extract contrastive information from the biomedical literature by analyzing those syntactic structures contain-ing the negative  X  X ot. X 
When we compare the expressions with coordination and those with paral-lelism, we find that the expressions that are matched to such patterns of coor-dination, as in list (13), are much simpler than those that show parallelism, as expected. (13) (a) A but not B
First, the expressions of focused objects that match those patterns have the same syntactic category because they are connected by coordinating conjunc-tions. For example, the protein names in the example (6) are noun phrases and the coordinated expressions in the example (14) are prepositional phrases. (14) Our results show that Cdc37 binds to AR but not to glucocorticoid receptors
Second, focused proteins often belong to the same protein family and, thus, their names are morphologically similar, as shown in the example (1) [cf. Cohen et al. 2002]. In addition to the morphosyntactic characteristics, the negative  X  X ot X  and coordinating conjunctions work together as bookend expressions, often along with commas and periods, as in examples (1) and (6), or with prepositions, as in example (14). Although these characteristics make it quite straightforward to match the patterns in list (13) to the corresponding expressions of contrastive information, there still remain the difficulties of dealing with coordination, attachment of prepositional phrases, part-of-speech ( POS
As for parallelism, a pair of parallel expressions for a presupposed property often shows syntactic and/or semantic similarities. For example, the verb phrase  X  X ssociates with replication origins X  in the first sentence of example (8), which works as the presupposed property, is both syntactically and semantically par-allel to the phrase  X  X ssociate with origins X  in the second sentence. Example (15) shows parallelism between noun phrases, where both biological events of as-sociation and interaction between proteins indicate physical contacts between the proteins. (15) Second, the association of Nck5a-(145-170) to C48 can be markedly
There are certain syntactic variations of parallel expressions, which are se-mantically equivalent, as evidenced in examples (16) and (17). (16) The eIF3 binds to the 40S ribosome and promotes recruitment of the (17) We find HsMad1 associated with HsMad2 . Association with p55CDC ,
Note that there are syntactic relationships among the constituents of parallel expressions, such as, subject X  X erb and verb X  X bject relations. For example, the protein name eIF3 in example (16) is the subject of the verb  X  X inds, X  and the same string is the object of the preposition  X  X etween X  that modifies the noun phrase  X  X hysical contact, X  where the phrases  X  X IF3 binds to X  and  X  X hysical con-tact between eIF3 X  indicate the presupposed property in example (16). In ex-ample (17), the protein name HsMad1, which is the subject of the first sentence, is omitted in the second sentence, where it can be realized as a prepositional phrase, thereby forming  X  X ssociation of HsMad1 with p55CDC. X  In order to deal with these syntactic variations, we can construct a limited set of patterns that are semantically equivalent, as shown in (18). (18) (a) A bind to B, A interact with B, A associate with B
There are other kinds of similarities between parallel expressions. In exam-ples (19) and (15), the word pairs {  X  X equired, X   X  X ndispensable X   X  X ffect X  } show synonymy and hypernymy relations, respectively, as inferable from WordNet [Fellbaum 1998]. (19) Further studies showed the RING-finger motif of MAT1 is not required
If any phrases in parallel expressions are anaphoric, then we need to resolve them as well. For instance, because the definite noun phrase  X  X he protein X  in the matrix clause in (20) refers to the protein GRASP, the event  X  X arboring of
GRASP X  is parallel to the event  X  X ssociation of the protein. X  (20) Although GRASP does not harbor a predicted membrane spanning do-
Note that the phrase  X  X as observed to X  in (20) intervenes the component phrases of the event of association, i.e.,  X  X he protein X  and  X  X ssociated. X  In addi-tion to the overt anaphoric expressions of this kind, we also need to deal with missing arguments, as shown in examples (17) and (21), and the pro verb  X  X o X  as shown in example (7). (21) Introducing the proline mutations into R-Ras(38V) suppressed the effect of
In addition to the parallelism with the negative  X  X ot, X  there are other sen-tences with parallelism in the biomedical literature as in (22). This sentence encodes contrastive information without the negative  X  X ot, X  but with the sub-ordinate conjunction  X  X hile X  and the pair of verbs in the antonymy relation {  X  X uppress, X   X  X upport X  } . (22) Transient transfection experiments show that p97 suppresses both cap-de-
Also, contrastive information can be formed with other negative expressions, such as  X  X o, X   X  X ever, X  and  X  X ardly. X  As we focus on the negative  X  X ot X  in this paper, we leave these issues for future work. 2.2 Biological Aspects
The focused objects of contrasts in the biomedical literature can be roughly clas-sified into the following semantic classes: Proteins, e.g., (2), protein domains, e.g., (23), protein mutations, e.g., (24), biological events, e.g., (7), experimental conditions, e.g., (25), species, e.g., (26), and others. (23) Exogenous hemopexin C domain of gelatinase A , but not that of MT1-MMP , (24) The binding of topoisomerase I to DNA was inhibited by the addition of (25) Furthermore, Tax inhibited the catalytic activity of topoisomerase I as (26) Importantly, E6 proteins of high-risk HPVs but not low-risk HPVs were Table III shows a distribution of the biological classes of focused objects.
Notice that contrasts between other biological objects except proteins and protein domains often imply contrasts between proteins or protein domains. For example, the sentence (7) describes contrast between two deletion events, but it actually indicates the difference between the N-terminal and the C-terminal
ATPase domain of Mot1. Similarly, the contrast between two species  X  X igh-risk HPVs X  and  X  X ow-risk HPVs X  in (26) actually explains the contrast between proteins from the two species.

There are certain types of biological relations between focused proteins, for example belonging to the same protein family, e.g., (14), protein, e.g., (27), subunits of a protein complex, e.g., (6), protein, e.g., (28). (27) We have also shown that the SH2 domain of Sck , but not that of Src-(28) By using the yeast two-hybrid system, muskelin was found to bind with
Table IV shows a distribution of the biological relations between focused proteins. 13
The presupposed properties in the training corpus usually indicate the bi-ological events of binding to other proteins as shown in example (6) (29/50, 58%), or the property of containing a common subregion as shown in example (29) (4/50, 8%). (29) Here we report that MSH3 and MSH6 , but not MSH2 , contain N-terminal
The other kinds of presupposed properties in the training corpus are also related to protein functions, including promotion, reduction, and inhibition, where fo-cused objects can be either subjective or objective agents of the functions. This distribution of presupposed properties seems to happen because of the MeSH terms,  X  X east protein interaction, X  which are used to construct the training corpus. 2.3 Summary
We found that expressions of negation in the biomedical literature often en-code information of contrast between proteins with respect to their ability of binding to other proteins, when we consider only dominant classes of focused objects and presupposed properties. From such information, we can infer the ac-tual binding sites of the focused proteins that are involved in the binding events expressed by presupposed properties. The fact that focused proteins usually be-long to the same protein family, and thus homologous, supports this inference in the sense that the nonoverlapping regions of homologous proteins would be the best candidates for the actual binding sites. It also supports the potential subcategorization of protein families, in the sense that the test of whether cer-tain members of a protein family are involved in a presupposed property or not can serve as a criterion for subcategorization of the protein family. A piece of evidence for the subcategorization is that Gene Ontology has many terms that describe the ability of binding to proteins or other molecules, such as  X  X alactose binding, X  like the dominant class of presupposed properties. 3. METHODS
We present a method of extracting contrastive information from the biomed-ical literature by analyzing the negative  X  X ot X  as discussed in Section 2. The method first selects a sentence that contains  X  X ot. X  If one of the coordinating conjunctions in (13) appears in the sentence, then the method tries to match relevant patterns to the sentence. In addition, if it can find one of the subor-dinate conjunctions in (30), 14 it tries to identify parallelism between the main clause and the subordinate clause of the sentence; otherwise, it tries to identify parallelism of the sentence with either the preceding or the following sentence. (30) whereas, although, while, and, despite, but, since, however, yet
The proposed method does not involve a full parsing technique [cf. Friedman et al. 1994], because the types of syntactic structures that the method should analyze are highly constrained. For example, the pattern  X  X  but not B X  can be rewritten with more specific patterns as in (31), 15 in which case, the method needs to recognize the noun phrases that are located to the left or to the right of  X  X ot, X  conjunctions, verbs, and prepositions. (31) (a) NP but not NP Figure 1 shows the process of matching the pattern  X  X REP NP but not PREP
NP X  to sentence (14).
The syntactic structure that shows parallelism is also highly constrained, and mostly falls into one of the categories in (32). 16 (32) (a) Subj 1 not V 2 Obj C / Subj 1 V 2 Obj C
The process of matching those patterns to sentences can be decomposed into successive subprocesses of recognizing noun phrases. Such subprocesses are basically identical to noun-phrase recognition in the process of matching the patterns in (13), because the process of locating subjects and objects starts from verbs that are negated by  X  X ot X  and from verbs or nouns that are synonymous to the negated verb.

In order to recognize a noun phrase starting from a certain position in a sentence, the proposed method identifies the syntactic structures that fre-quently modify noun phrases, such as cascaded prepositional phrases and rel-ative clauses, and simple coordination. For this purpose, it first identifies all the base noun phrases in the sentence by utilizing the regular expression for parts-of-speech ( POS ) in (33), 17 where a base noun phrase consists only of nouns, pronouns, adjectives (with adverbs modifying the adjectives), and determiners. (33) ((DT +| PR)?CD*(RB*JJ + )?NN + ) | PR
The noun-phrase recognizer then locates a base noun phrase that is adjacent to the starting position. If the word next to the base noun phrase is a preposition, it continues to identify cascaded prepositional phrases. If the next word is a comma, then the recognizer searches for another comma with which the first comma constitutes a bookend expression that surrounds a relative clause or an adverbial phrase. If the next word is a coordinating conjunction, such as,  X  X nd, X  it identifies relatively simple coordination, while discarding complex coordina-tion. For example, it identifies coordination of morphologically and syntactically similar noun phrases, such as,  X  X GA2.1 and TGA2.2 X  and  X  X igh-risk HPVs and low-risk HPVs, X  and coordination of verb phrases.
In addition to syntactic analysis, we also need to analyze semantic similar-ities between parallel phrases for parallelism identification. The analysis of semantic similarities can be decomposed into multiple comparisons between smaller phrases. For example, the parallelism in example (8) can be identified by matching  X  X ssociates X  in the first sentence to  X  X ssociate X  in the second sen-tence and then by matching  X  X eplication origins X  to  X  X rigins X . In order to deal with word-level similarity, the method utilizes the relations in WordNet. It uti-lizes the synonymous relations between adjectives in WordNet for comparison between adjectives, 18 and the hypernymy relations between verbs in WordNet and the set of verbs in (18) for comparison between verbs. As for similarities between noun phrases, we assume that two noun phrases are similar, for ex-ample, when the headword of a noun phrase is the same as that of the other, when one is a plural form of the other as in { ATRR4, ATRRs noun phrases corefer. Furthermore, the method utilizes the derivational rela-tion of verbs with their nominal derivatives in WordNet in order to deal with similarities between verbs and nouns. 4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We have implemented a system that extracts contrastive information accord-ing to the method described in Section 3. The implemented system contains two modules, one for matching the patterns of subclausal coordination and the other for parallelism identification. These modules share a submodule for noun-phrase recognition and use MedPost, a POS tagger for biomedical text [Smith et al. 2004]. We have evaluated the system with an unseen test corpus consist-ing of 50 abstracts, obtained from MEDLINE with the same MeSH terms,  X  X east protein interaction, X  as the construction of the training corpus. The test corpus has 72 sentences, each of which contains at least one occurrence of the neg-ative  X  X ot X  and an interaction keyword, such as  X  X nteract, X   X  X ind, X   X  X ctivate, X  and  X  X nhibit, X  adapted from Kim and Park [2004b]. These sentences contain 52 occurrences of  X  X ot X  that represent contrastive information, among which there are 32 occurrences with subclausal coordination and 15 with clause-level parallelism.

From the abstracts in the test corpus, our system correctly extracts 32 con-trasts (61.5% recall) and 10 contrasts incorrectly (76.2% precision), where the F score is 68.1. Among the incorrect results, four contrasts are fractions of correct results that are partially extracted from the sentences with coordinate struc-tures, including the contrast between  X 4-hydroxytamoxifen X  and  X  X CI 164384 X  from example (34) and that between  X  X unc18c(1-139) and munc18c(1-225) X  and  X  X unc18c(226-592) X  from (35). (34) Moreover, this enhancement of transcriptional activation by COUP-TF1 (35) Full-length munc18c(1-592), munc18c(1-139), and munc18c(1-225) , but
Since the partially extracted results are correct information, although they are fractions of correct results, we may consider them correct as well when we calculate the precision for the system. The precision would then be 85.7% and the recall with partial results 69.2%, where the F score is 76.6. 5. DISCUSSION
Most of results that the system extracted incorrectly are due to incorrect iden-tification of parallelism between noun phrases. For example, the system in-correctly extracts a  X  X ontrast X  between  X  X he COOH-terminal acidic domain of
TAP/p115 X  and  X  X AP/p115 association with peripheral VTCs X  from example (36), by incorrectly matching the anaphoric expression  X  X his interaction X  to the noun phrase  X  X AP/p115 interaction, X  where both noun phrases have the same headword  X  X nteraction. X  (36) TAP/p115 binds the cis-Golgi protein GM130, and the COOH-terminal
The system also incorrectly matches two noun phrases starting with  X  X uta-tions X  in example (37), because of the similarity of their headwords. These problems can be addressed by analyzing subsumption relations between noun phrases. (37) Mutations at these positions prevent interaction with the DSS4 GEF
As for recall, the system correctly identifies 31/32 contrasts (96.9% recall) that are represented with subclausal coordination in the test corpus, but it fails to extract 10 contrasts represented with clause-level parallelism (33.3% recall). The low recall of parallelism identification can be addressed by con-structing the pairs of verbs that are synonymous in the biomedical domain, for example { block, inhibit } in example (38), along with a list of phrases that can be inserted between  X  X ot X  and verbs, such as  X  X ound to X  and  X  X e able to X  in example (39). Moreover, there are five contrasts in the test corpus, including example (40), whose identification requires semantic analysis with inference over surface structures. We leave these problems for future work.

Also, it may not be correct to say that occurrences of the negative  X  X ot X  in other subsets of MEDLINE abstracts that do not include interaction keywords also mostly encode contrastive information, as pointed out by an anonymous re-viewer. When we tested the implemented system on a corpus constructed with the MeSH term  X  X untington disease, X  the system extracted only 289 pieces of contrastive information from 4491 abstracts. Since the number of extracted re-sults is related to the MeSH terms for corpus construction when negation in disease-related articles seems to show different characteristics, we need to con-sider domain-specific analysis of negation. Similarly, we also need to consider the possible difference of negative expressions in MEDLINE abstracts and in their full texts, where sections in full texts and those in abstracts may have different characteristics [cf. Robert et al. 1993].
 As mentioned in the introductory section, there are several entries of Swiss-
Prot, whose comment fields include expressions of contrastive information. Its release 45.0 (25-Oct-2004) includes 163,235 sequence entries and, among them, only 6517 entries (4.0%) have comments with occurrences of the negative  X  X ot. X 
However, contrastive information in Swiss-Prot comment fields usually indi-cates difference between expressions in tissues, as described in the subfield  X  X ISSUE SPECIFICITY, X  while the most dominant class of presupposed prop-erties in the training corpus is the biological event of binding to other proteins as explained in Section 2.2.

The implemented system utilizes only a basic technique for noun-phrase recognition and semantic resources. In particular, it does not apply any machine-learning techniques. We believe, however, that it would not be straightforward to apply machine-learning techniques, such as Support Vec-tor Machine (SVM), directly to contrast extraction, because the expressions of negation involve different kinds of similarities, including morphological, syn-tactic, and semantic similarities, and also because contrastive information is described with a pair of expressions, a fact that cannot be addressed straight-forwardly by the unordered set of features for SVM.

In this paper, we have focused on the negative  X  X ot X  that shows contrastive information with subclausal coordination and clause-level parallelism. How-ever, we need to deal with other negatives, such as  X  X o X  and expressions of shaded negation such as  X  X ardly X  and  X  X eldom, X  which can also convey such information. While there are several negative expressions in general domain that eventually convey positive information, as in  X  X he didn X  X  let things flow X  [Amsili and Hathout 1996], we have not considered this possibility because of the lack of relevant data in the training corpus. Also, we have not dealt with negated sentences with quantifiers, because of the lack of such cases. We plan to reconsider these linguistic phenomena when we do find them in a future corpus. 6. CONCLUSION We have examined the characteristics of the negative  X  X ot X  in a subset of MED-
LINE abstracts, which include biological interaction keywords, and have found that most of its occurrences represent contrasts between involved biological ob-jects. We have presented a system that extracts such contrastive information by analyzing subclausal coordination and clause-level parallelism, which are the most prevalent syntactic structures of  X  X ot X  in the corpus. The extracted contrastive information is complementary to the protein-related information that has been extracted by other biomedical text mining systems, because it is a combination of interrelated pieces of information in which negative infor-mation is more reliable, and also because it gives insights into the nature of biological objects and provides a clue to proper subcategorization of protein families.

The contrast extraction with the patterns proposed in Section 3 is quite similar to interaction extraction with interaction keywords of interest, in the sense that both processes require recognition of noun phrases that start from certain words, such as, negatives, conjunctions, and interaction keywords [Kim and Park 2004b]. This may allow us to adopt, for example the bidirectional incremental parsing instead of the proposed noun-phrase recognition, which can be rewritten into regular expressions, for the purpose of enhancing the performance of the implemented system. We leave this possibility for future work. Furthermore, in order to improve the performance of the implemented system, we need to deal with the phenomena of coordination more rigorously and also to make full use of inference and anaphora resolution in a systematic way.
