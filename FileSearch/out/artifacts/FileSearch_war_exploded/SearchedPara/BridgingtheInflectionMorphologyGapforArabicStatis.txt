 The problem of translating from a language e x-hibiting rich inflectional morphology to a language e xhibiting relati v ely poor inflectional morphology presents se v eral challenges to the e xisting compo-nents of the statistical machine translation (SMT) process. This inflection g ap causes an ab undance of surf ace w ord forms 1 in the source language com-pared with relati v ely fe w forms in the tar get lan-guage. This mismatch aggra v ates se v eral issues found in natural language processing: more un-kno wn w ords forms in unseen data, more w ords oc-curring only once, more distinct w ords and lo wer tok en-to-type ratios (mean number of occurrences o v er all distinct w ords) in the source language than in the tar get language.

Le xical relationships under t he standard IBM models (Bro wn et al., 1993) do not account for man y-to-man y mappings, and phrase e xtraction re-lies hea vily on the accurac y of the IBM w ord-to-w ord alignment. In this w ork, we propose an ap-proach to bridge the inflectional g ap that addresses the issues descri b e d abo v e through a series of pre-processing steps based on the Buckw alter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (B AMA) tool (Buckw alter , 2004). While (Lee et al., 2003) de v elop accurate se gmentation models of Arabic surf ace w ord forms using manually se gmented data, we rely instead on the translated conte xt in the tar get language, le v er -aging the manually constructed le xical gloss from B AMA to select the appropriate se gmented sense for each Arabic source w ord.

Our technique, applied as preprocessing to the source corpus, splits and normalizes surf ace w ords based on the tar get sentence conte xt. In contrast to (Popo vic and Ne y , 2004) and (Nie X en and Ne y , 2004), we do not modify the IBM models, and we lea v e reordering ef fects to the decoder . Statistically significant impro v ements (Zhang and V ogel, 2004) in BLEU and NIST translation score o v er a lightly stemmed baseline are reported on the a v ailable and well kno wn BTEC IWSL T X 05 Arabic-English cor -pus (Eck and Hori, 2005). Arabic-to-English machine translation e x emplifies some of the issues caused by the inflection g ap. Re-fer to (Buckw alter , 2005) and (Lark e y et al., 2002) for e xamples that highlight morphological inflection for a simple Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) w ord and basic stemming operations that we use as our baseline system. (Nie X en and Ne y , 2000) tackle the inflection g ap for German-to-English w ord ali g nm ent by perform-ing a series of morphological operations on the Ger -man te xt. The y fragment w ords based on a full morphological analysis of the sentence, b ut need to use domain specific and hand written rules to deal with ambiguous fragmentation. (Nie X en and Ne y , 2004) also e xtend the corpus by annotating each source w ord with morphological information and b uilding a hierarchical le xicon. The e xperimental results sho w dramatic impro v ements from sentence-le v el restructuring (question in v ersion, separated v erb prefix es and mer ging phrases), b ut limited im-pro v ement from the hierarchical le xicon, especially as the size of the training data increases.
W e conduct our morphological analysis at the w ord le v el, using Buckw alter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (B AMA) v ersion 2.0 (Buckw alter , 2004). B AMA analyzes a gi v en surf ace w ord, returning a set of potential se gmentations (order of a dozen) for the source w ord into prefix es, stems, and suf fix es. Our techniques select the appropriate splitting from that set by taking into account the tar get sides (full sentences) of that w ord X  s occurrences in the training corpus. W e no w describe each splitting technique that we apply . 2.1 B AMA: Simple fragment splitting W e be gin by simply replacing each Arabic w ord with the fragments representing the first of the pos-sible splittings returned by the B AMA tool. B AMA uses simple w ord-based heurist ics to rank the split-ting alternati v es. 2.2 CONTEXT : Single Sense selection In the step CONTEXT , we tak e adv antage of the gloss information pro vided in B AMA  X  s le xicon. Each potential splitting corresponds to a particular choice of prefix, stem and suf fix, all of which e xist in the manually constructed le xicon, along with a set of possible translations ( glosses ) for each fragment. W e select a fragmentation (choice of splitting for the source w ord) whose corresponding glosses ha v e the most tar get side matches in the parallel translation (of the full sentence). The choice of fragmentation is sa v ed and used for all occurrences of the surf ace form w ord in training and testing, introducing con-te xt sensiti vity without parsing solutions. In case of unseen w ords during testing, we se gment it simply using the first alternati v e from the B AMA tool. This allo ws us to still translate an unseen test w ord cor -rectly e v en if the surf ace form w as ne v er seen during training. 2.3 CORRMA TCH: Corr espondence matching The Arabic language often encodes l inguistic in-formation within the surf ace w ord form that is not present in English. W ord fragments that represent this missing information are misleading in the trans-lation process unless e xplicitly aligned to the NULL w ord on the tar get side. In this step we e xplicitly remo v e fragments that correspond to le xical infor -mation that is not represented in English. While (Lee, 2004) b uilds part of speech models to recog-nize such elements, we use the f act that their corre-sponding English translations in the B AMA le xicon are empty . Examples of such fragments are case and gender mark ers. As an e xample of CORRMA TCH remo v al, we present the Arabic sentence  X  h X *A lA ya zAl u g ayor naZiyf  X  (after B AMA only) which becomes  X  X  X *A lA ya zAl g ayor naZiyf X  after the CORRMA TCH stage. The  X  X  X  has been remo v ed. W e e v aluate the impact of inflectional splitting on the BTEC (T ak eza w a et al., 2002) IWSL T05 Ara-bic language data track. The  X  X upplied X  data track includes a 20K Arabic/English sentence pair train-ing set, as well as a de v elopment ( X  X e vSet X ) and test ( X  X  est05 X ) set of 500 Arabic sentences each and 16 reference translations per Arabic sentence. De-tails re g arding the IWSL T e v aluation criteria and data topic and collection methods are a v ailable in (Eck and Hori, 2005). W e also e v aluate on test and de v elopment data randomly sampled from the com-plete supplied de v and test data, due to considera-tions noted by (Josep M.Cre go, 2005) re g arding the similarity of the de v elopment and test data sets. 3.1 System description T ranslation e xperiments were conducted using the (V ogel et a l., 2003) system with reordering and fu-ture cost estimation. W e trained translation parame-ters for 10 scores (language model, w ord and phrase count, and 6 translation model scores from (V ogel, 2005) ) with Minimum Error Rate training on the de v elopment set. W e optimized separately for both the NIST (Doddington, 2002) and the BLEU metrics (P apineni et al., 2002). T able 1 and 2 sho ws the results of each stage of inflectional splitting on the BLEU and NIST metrics. Basic orthographic normalization serv es as a baseline (mer ging all Alif, tar marb uta, ee forms to the base form). The test set NIST scores sho w steady impro v ements of up t o 5 percent rel-ati v e, as more sophisticated splitting techniques are used, ie B AMA+CONTEXT+CORRMA TCH.
 These impro v ements are statistica lly significant o v er the baseline in both metrics as measured by t h e tech-niques in (Zhang and V ogel, 2004).

Our NIST results for all the final stages of inflec-tional splitting w ould place us abo v e the top NIST scores from the ISWL T e v aluation on the supplied test set. 2 On both De vSet/T est05 and the randomly split data, we see more dramatic impro v ements in the NIST scores than in BLEU. This might be due to the NIST metric X  s sensiti vity to correctly translating certain hi g h g ain w ords in the test corpus. Inflec-tional splitting techniques that cause pre viously un-kno wn surf ace form w ords to be translated correctly after splitti ng can significantly impact the o v erall score. This w ork sho ws the potential for significant im-pro v ements in machine translation quality by di-rectly bridging the inflectional g ap across language pairs. Our method tak es adv antage of source and tar get language conte xt when conducting morpho-logical analysis of each surf ace w ord form, while a v oiding comple x parsing engines or refinements to the alignment training process. Our results are pre-sented on moderately sized corpora rather than the scarce resource domain that has been traditionally emplo yed to highlight the impact of detailed mor -phological analysis.

By sho wing t he impact of simple processing steps we encourage the creation of simple w ord and gloss le v el analysis tools for ne w languages and sho w that small in v estments in this direction (compared to high octane conte xt sensiti v e parsing tools) can yield dramatic impro v ements, especia lly when rapid de v elopment of machine translation tools becomes increasingly rele v ant to t he research community . While our w ork focused on processing the morpho-logically rich language and then translating  X  X o wn X  into the morphologically poor language, we plan to use the analysis tools de v eloped here to model the re v erse translation process as well, the harder task of translating  X  X p X  into a highly inflected space.
