 The ACM 1 st International Workshop on Privacy and Security of Big Data (PSBD 2014), held in Shanghai, China on November 7, 2014, in conjunction with the ACM 23 rd International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2014), presents research on privacy and security of big data, an emerging challenge in actual database and data mining research. PSBD 2014 program has two interesting sessions on ( i ) scalable privacy-preserving and security-control methods for big data processing , and ( ii ) user-oriented and data-oriented privacy methods for big data processing , plus a panel discussing current challenges and future research perspectives of privacy and security of big data. H.2 [DATABASE MANAGEMENT]: H.2.7 Database Administration  X  Security, integrity, and protection Algorithms, Design, Management, Performance, Theory Privacy of Big Data, Security of Big Data The ACM 1 st International Workshop on Privacy and Security of Big Data (PSBD 2014) focuses the attention on research issues and practical applications/systems pertinent to the problem of preserving the privacy and guaranteeing the security of big data, an emerging challenge in actual database and data mining research (e.g., [6,7]). The addressed problem is relevant for a wide range of research context, ranging from social networks to smart grids , from OLAP methodologies (e.g., [8,9]) to spatial data , and so forth. One of the most challenging scenario, however, is the one represented by analytics over big data (e.g., [10,11,12,13]), where analytics procedures run on large-scale amounts of distributed big data, hence leading to critical privacy and security breaches in Cloud-enabled outsourced databases . In line with these emerging trends, PSBD 2014 includes 5 full papers, accepted out of 12 submissions, grouped into two sessions: ( i ) scalable privacy-preserving and security-control methods for big data processing , and ( ii ) user-oriented and data-oriented privacy methods for big data processing . The topics are diverse, including methods for evaluating the impact of data anonymization approaches over large-scale interaction network data sets, privacy-preserving Apriori pattern discovery in MapReduce frameworks, systems for supporting the secure and big-data-adaptive cross-domain communication, probabilistic techniques for predicting privacy risks in user-search logs, skyline query processing over encrypted data. The program also includes a panel discussing current challenges and future research perspectives of privacy and security of big data. This session focuses on the latest research results in the context of scalable privacy-preserving and security-control methods for big data processing. M X rio J. Silva, Pedro Rijo and Alexandre Francisco [1] focus the attention on the publication of a large academic information dataset addressing privacy issues . They evaluate anonymization techniques achieving the intended protection goal, while retaining the utility of the anonymized data. The released data could help infer behaviors and subsequently find solutions for daily planning activities, such as cafeteria attendance, cleaning schedules or student performance, or study interaction patterns among an academic population. However, the nature of the academic data is such that many implicit social interaction networks can be derived from the anonymized datasets, raising the need for researching how anonymity can be assessed in this setting. Kangsoo Jung, Sehwa Park and Seog Park [2] consider Hadoop , a popular open-source distributed system that can process large scale data, and Data Mining as one of the techniques used to find patterns and gain knowledge from data sets, as well as improve massive data processing utility when combined with the Hadoop framework. However, Data Mining constitutes a possible threat to privacy, as widely understood. Although numerous studies have been conducted to address this problem, such studies were insufficient and had several drawbacks such as privacy-data utility trade-off . In order to fulfill this gap, authors focus on privacy preserving data mining algorithm techniques , particularly the association rule mining algorithm Apriori , and propose a novel privacy-preserving association rule mining algorithm in Hadoop that prevents privacy violation without the loss of data utility. Through the experimental results, the proposed technique is validated to prevent the exposure of sensitive data without degradation of data utilization. Avinash Srinivasan, Jie Wu and Wen Zhu [3] explore the context of Cross Domain Communication (CDC), and recognize that today X  X  infrastructure primarily consists of vendor-specific guard products that have little inter-domain coordination at runtime. Unaware of the context and semantics of the CDC message being processed, these guards heavily rely on rudimentary filtering techniques making the information domains vulnerable to an array of attacks . This often necessitates time-consuming human intervention to adjudicate messages in order to meet the desired security and privacy requirements of the communicating domains, causing performance bottlenecks. By overcoming actual state-of-the-art research, authors present a set of key requirements and design principles for a service oriented CDC Security Infrastructure in form of a CDC Reference Architecture , featuring so-called Domain Associated Guards (DOGs) as active workflow participants. The proposed framework, called SAFE, is secure and adaptable. SAFE also provides the foundation for the development of protocols and Ontologies enabling runtime coordination among CDC elements. This enables more flexible, interoperable, and efficient CDC designs to serve mission needs, specifically among critical infrastructure domains as well as domains with significantly differing security and privacy vocabulary . Because of the DOG approach, SAFE also overcomes the scalability problems faced by exiting solutions. This session focuses on the latest research results in the context of user-oriented and data-oriented privacy methods for big data processing. Joanna Biega, Ida Mele and Gerhard Weikum [4] propose a new model of user-centric, global, probabilistic privacy , geared for today X  X  challenges of helping users to manage their privacy-sensitive information across a wide variety of social networks , online communities, QA forums, and search histories. The approach anticipates an adversary that harnesses global background knowledge and rich statistics in order to make educated guesses, that is, probabilistic inferences , at sensitive data. The final goal is represented by a tool that simulates such a powerful adversary, predicts privacy risks, and guides the user. The devised framework is then specialized for the case of Internet search histories. Also, authors present preliminary experiments that demonstrate how estimators of global correlations among sensitive and non-sensitive key-value items can be fed into a probabilistic graphical model in order to compute meaningful measures of privacy risk . Suvarna Bothe, Alfredo Cuzzocrea, Panagiotis Karras and Akrivi Vlachou [5] address the problem of making co-existent and convergent the need for efficiency of relational query processing over Clouds and the security of data themselves, which is figuring-out how one of the most challenging research problems in the big data era. Indeed, in actual analytics-oriented engines, such as Google Analytics and Amazon S3 , where key-value storage-representation and efficient-management models are employed as to cope with the simultaneous processing of billions of transactions, querying encrypted data is becoming one of the most annoying problem, which has also attracted a great deal of attention from the research community. While this issue has been applied to a large variety of data formats, e.g. relational, RDF and multidimensional data, very few initiatives have pointed-out skyline query processing over encrypted data , which is, indeed, relevant for database analytics. In order to fulfill this methodological and technological gap, authors present eSkyline , a prototype system and query interface that enables the processing of skyline queries over encrypted data, even without preserving the order on each attribute as order-preserving encryption would do. The proposed system comprises of an encryption scheme that facilitates the evaluation of domination relationships, hence allows for state-of-the-art skyline processing algorithms to be used. In order to prove the effectiveness and the reliability of our system, we also provide the details of the underlying encryption scheme, plus a suitable GUI that allows a user to interact with a server, and showcases the efficiency of computing skyline queries and decrypting the results. PSBD 2014 presents relevant research results and open discussion on next-generation research directions focusing the context of privacy and security of big data, that we hope will serve as a valuable and up-to-date reference for actual and future research efforts.
