 1. Introduction
RFID tags are increasingly being deployed in a wide variety of application domains (e.g., Totty, 2009 ). Although RFID tags have been in existence for over seven decades, recent developments in information systems technology, the availability of relatively cheap RFID tags, and the need to utilize as much information as is available to make intelligent decisions or automate systems have resulted in its explosive growth during the past decade. Unlike bar codes where scanning needs to occur from close proximity, RFID tags are capable of communicating with readers that are not necessarily nearby and in direct line-of-sight. While this capability is clearly advantageous in automated systems where the need to visually or manually check for the existence of any given entity is minimal, there may be related conse-quences. For example, an adversary can take advantage of this dynamic which could possibly lead to associated security and privacy violations as well as degradation in competitive advan-tage for firms.

Not surprisingly, this is a very active research area. For the most part, security and privacy issues related to RFID tags are handled through cryptography. Security protocols are used to authenticate RFID tags. While this seems to be operable in principle, there is a lack of robust and secure authentication protocols that can be used to secure RFID-tagged entities from attacks from resourceful adversaries. Authentication protocols vary depending on application needs. A majority of authentication protocols are one-way in the sense that the reader generally authenticates the tag and not vice versa . However, there is a need for two-way authentication where both the reader and the tag authenticate each other to ensure that both the parties are communicating with the intended parties and not with an adversary.
 Extant literature has several mutual authentication protocols. Unfortunately, quite a few of these protocols are vulnerable to attacks from a resourceful and active adversary (e.g., Piramuthu, 2010 ). Any given vulnerability in an RFID authentication protocol has the potential to violate privacy and security of the tagged object as well as hide the existence of the tagged object from the view of an automated system. Recently, the Engineering Applica-tions of Artificial Intelligence Journal published a paper dealing with RFID authentication protocols. The mutual authentication protocol introduced in this paper, however, is vulnerable to attacks from an active adversary. We identify some existing vulnerabilities in this authentication protocol. We also discuss some of the characteristics that renders this protocol to be open to preventable vulnerabilities. We do not attempt to present or propose a modified version of the Chen and Deng protocol since that is not the purpose of this paper.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we consider the Chen and Deng protocol and identify some vulner-abilities in this protocol in the next section. We conclude the paper with a brief discussion in the last section.
 2. Mutual authentication protocol by the protocol presented in the paper considered and the identification of some of its inherent vulnerabilities. Since detailed information is available in Chen and Deng (2009) ,we only provide a sketch of the protocol in this paper. The interested reader may consult the original paper (i.e., Chen and Deng, 2009 ) for further details.
 2.1. Chen and Deng protocol tication. In this mutual authentication protocol, each tag T assigned a fixed set of  X  N i , k i  X  values (where i represents the index for tag T i ) and these are maintained in a database. The process of assigning these values occurs during the registration phase. Also, each of the readers in this setting is assigned a set of tags and their secret values (i.e., N , k ) are transferred from the database to these readers during the registration phase. These values are never updated in the protocol. A sketch of their protocol is given in Fig. 1 .
 to the constant M req , M resp , and r T X values. In general, it is difficult to design and develop authentication protocols using cryptography that are devoid of vulnerabilities when the variables and all parameters used in the protocol remain static. Freshly generated nonce are generally used in every authentication round to decrease the probability of encountering vulnerabilities in these protocols.
 forms including DoS (Denial of Service), impersonation, among others. Impersonation vulnerabilities in this context include tag impersonation and reader impersonation. Tag impersonation signifies the presence of an adversary that can completely impersonate the tag to authentic and honest readers. I.e., a honest reader will not be able to distinguish responses it receives from the honest and authentic tag from those that it receives from an adversary impersonating this tag. Since most automated systems do not visually verify the existence of the RFID-tagged entities, the adversary can easily get away with impersonating the tag.
Reader impersonation works the other way around whereby the tag is unable to differentiate messages it receives from a honest reader vs. those that it receives from the reader-impersonating adversary. Impersonation is a serious problem in automated systems especially when critical, sensitive, or expensive entities are the subject of impersonation.

Deng protocol  X  one where a resourceful adversary may imperso-nate the reader to the tag and one where the adversary may impersonate the tag to the reader. The former could result in the adversary being able to track the tag. The ability to be tracked and traced violates security and privacy of the tagged entity. The latter could result in the adversary being able to clone the tag from the reader X  X  perspective.

Y is constant. An adversary passively observes a round of the authentication protocol between a given tag and reader and copies all communication between these two entities. The attack can be instantiated any time from now on. This attack is not a one-shot event in the sense that this can be carried out indefi-nitely for the adversary to track and trace this tag even without the presence of this particular reader in the immediate vicinity.
Once the adversary has all the messages from an authentication round of this protocol, the adversary can just send the first message whenever it wants to track the tag. Since Y is constant, the adversary can confirm the presence of this specific tag from its response. The adversary can then send M resp to the tag to complete the protocol. During this process, the tag is not aware of the presence of the adversary since the messages are as if they are from a trusted reader.

Round-1 / Passively observe and copy communication between Round-2 / When reader R j sends M req , r R , CRC  X  N i r sonate the tag. The vulnerability is very similar to that of cloning a tag. Here, the adversary again passively observes a round of the mutual authentication protocol between a given pair of tag and reader and copies all the messages between tag and reader. The attack occurs when the reader tries to authenticate the tag any time in the future. When that happens, the tag can just XOR any d to the previously observed r T (the nonce generated by the tag) as same earlier run of the protocol. Since Y is constant, the adversary can send the same Y that it had copied earlier. The reader will then validate the tag. The d value is used to modify the message from tag to reader so that the reader does not observe the same response from the tag over time. This attack can be mounted forever from now on since none of the secret values are updated in this protocol. 2.2. Some vulnerable characteristics of Chen and Deng protocol
Given that the Chen and Deng RFID authentication protocol has serious flaws, we discuss a few of its characteristics that exposes it to such vulnerabilities. In general, these characteristics are to be avoided when developing strong protocols that are immune to such attacks from resourceful adversaries.

The main cause for concern in the Chen and Deng protocol is the complete absence of any variability and the validation of such variability in the messages sent between tag and reader. In the absence of variability, it is relatively straight-forward to mount attacks on such protocols. Although both the reader and tag generate fresh nonce during each authentication round, they are not utilized appropriately in the protocol. For example, the reader generates fresh nonce r R at the beginning of each authentication round. The reader even sends this nonce to the tag, which completely ignores it. Since this nonce ( r R ) is not used by the tag in any way, its purpose in the protocol is unclear. Ideally, the tag should use it as a part of its response so the reader knows that the tag indeed received its previous message. The tag cannot just reply with an earlier message from the reader.

Similarly, the tag generates its own fresh nonce ( r T ) during every authentication round. However, the structure of X and Y it generates nullify the effect of r T  X  X  randomness since r constant and this constant is used in both X and Y . This vulner-ability could be alleviated through proper design of X and Y such that both X and Y show some variability in addition to those provided by r T alone. Yet another possibility of preventing these impersonation attacks would be by updating the  X  N i , K i after each authentication round. 3. Discussion
Privacy and security are serious issues that demand immediate attention from researchers and practitioners in the area of RFID authentication protocols. As RFID tags become ubiquitous, there is a need to address issues related to security and privacy of developed protocols (e.g., Piramuthu, 2007 ). We identified vul-nerabilities in the mutual authentication protocol proposed in Chen and Deng (2009) . The protocol is shown to be unsecure in two different ways, with an adversary having the ability to impersonate both the tag and the reader. Therefore, this protocol cannot guarantee its stated goals of secure authentication. Given the precipitous rise in RFID implementations over the past decade, there is an urgent need to develop mutual authentication protocols that are secure and lightweight. While the Chen and Deng protocol is not secure as is, we hope researchers in this area are encouraged to develop protocols that are secure.
