 1. Introduction
Genres are socially recognized types of communicative actions that the members of a community enact to realize particular social purposes ( Yates &amp; Orlikowski, 1992 ). Intended users recognize genres as documents that show certain conventional features and have specific communicative functions. For example, scientists use the research article genre to communicate research results to their peers, and, as users of the scientific litera-ture, they have clear expectations regarding its content, structure, and norms. Research drawing on this under-standing of genre, deals with either printed genres or web genres . In contrast with their printed counterparts, web genres present, as distinguishing features, the functionalities afforded by the medium. That includes inter-activity, browsing, and searching ( Shepherd &amp; Watters, 1998, 1999 ), as well as what Askehave and Nielsen (2005) call two-dimensionality , i.e. the fact that users can both read and navigate web genres.
Genre theory informs research in many areas such as organizational studies or systems science. Its relevance for information science lies in the potential to improve retrieval and selection from large collections of docu-ments ( Beghtol, 2001; Hj  X  rland, 2002; Kwasnik &amp; Crowston, 2005 ). Crowston and Kwasnik (2003) explain that the concept of genre allows to improve document and query representation by capturing users X  informa-tion needs as situated in a particular context. In our opinion, genre theory can also make a contribution to information behavior and, in particular, information use research. This area of information studies is con-cerned with how individuals incorporate information into their existing knowledge base ( Wilson, 2000; Spink &amp; Cole, 2006 ), and genres, being characterized by a communicative purpose, tell us what people use them for. However, genre theory has not been exploited as yet to provide an insight into the way people use information.
In this research report, we discuss the web genres that a software engineer looks at in his daily work, trying to understand why and how he uses them. The research draws in part on genre theory, and in part on infor-mation behavior theory. In this introduction, we first discuss research into genres, paying special attention to manual or automatic genre identification and classification. Following, a discussion of models of information behavior complements the body of work on genre theory, with a focus on the information behavior of engineers. 1.1. Research into genres
Information scientists studying genre are primarily interested in genre classification in order to support doc-ument retrieval and selection. The task is complex, though the potential benefits are extremely appealing, espe-cially in regards to information retrieval from the web. Among the other applications, genre information can be used to filter or re-rank search results so that they can better adjust to the user X  X  query ( Finn &amp; Kushmerick, 2006 ). However, there are indeed obstacles to both manual and automatic classification. Crowston and Kwas-nik (2003) point out that the researcher may be at a loss for proper analysis tools. Traditional classification methods focus mostly on topic and cannot capture other genre features such as their being situated in a con-text ( Crowston &amp; Kwasnik, 2003 ). The nature of genres itself makes classifications difficult to achieve. Genres are elusive and constantly undergoing evolution ( Santini, Power, &amp; Evans, 2006 ). Crowston and Williams (2000) explain that genres can be reproduced or adapted from one context or one community to another, and that new genres can also emerge from the changing communicative patterns and situations of their users.
The proportions and the fluid, fast-paced nature of the web add further problems. On the web, genres may mix up characteristics of different other genres ( genre hybridism ), and they may also present individual variations ( genre individualization )( Santini, 2007 ). A large portion of research into genres deals significantly with the def-inition of single genres. Researchers tend to choose a diverse range of methodologies to capture the subtle nat-ure of genres. For example, in order to define the web-based newspaper genre, Vaughan and Dillon (2006) turn to some experts X  judgments in combination with a user-focused study, whereas Ihlstro  X  m and Henfridsson (2005) opt for a longitudinal study in a historical perspective.
 Despite all problems, attempts have been made to classify manually random samples of URLs ( Crowston &amp;
Williams, 2000 ), and semi-random samples of web pages ( Roussinov et al., 2001 ). It has been suggested that less vague classifications of web genres can be performed taking the web domain as a reference, such as the academic domains ( Rehm, 2002 ). Another line of research has tested different sets of features to develop auto-matic classifiers of web genres. Automatic genre classifiers seem to work better when a relationship between genre and topic is established ( Lee &amp; Myaeng, 2004; Finn &amp; Kushmerick, 2006 ). Web-specific sets of features have also proved useful for automatic classification. Lim, Lee, and Kim (2005) tested a set of features extracted from the URLs and the HTML tags, whereas Shepherd, Watters, and Kennedy (2004) took advan-tage of the executable code underlying web pages. However, combinations of general linguistic features, such as lexical features, proved insufficient for classifying genres ( Muresan, Smith, Cole, Liu, &amp; Belkin, 2006 ).
Genre classification becomes easier when a more precise context is established. Indeed, research areas that address genre in organizational and enterprise user communities, or in the scientific community can more eas-ily define a context of reference. Normally, it is printed or digital genres that are studied rather than those available on the web. Studies of this type include, for example, ( Yates, Orlikowski, &amp; Okamura, 1999 ) who looked at how genres were shaped following the introduction of a computer conferencing system in a Japanese enterprise document management system for a Finnish research organization, defining a repertory of 850 gen-res in direct cooperation with their intended users. Much work has also been done on scientific genres, like the scientific article, following Swales X  seminal work (1990) . In classifying scientific documents, the analyst has the advantage of working with existing collections of written documents that focus on a specific audience and show coherent and similar traits, like in Nickerson (2005) . 1.2. The need for a social and contextual perspective on web genre
In information science research, the social and contextual implications of genres, especially web genres, are taken into account to a limited extent. Genre is seldom considered as shaped according to the needs of specific communities and the individuals operating within them. Questions of the type: who uses this genre? why? how? what for? may be answered in organizational studies and document design studies ( Carliner &amp; Boswood, 2004 ), but they are rarely addressed in studies dealing with genre classification. Nonetheless, both social and contextual implications of genres are regarded as crucial for genre identification and classification. Toms and Campbell (1999) argue that contextual factors may be even more important than discourse communities for genre identification. For example, context can determine the way genres combine in genre systems, and the communicative function they serve (  X  sterlund, 2006 ). Few researchers, however, have explained genres in their contextual and social dimension.

The importance of context and the need for a social approach to studying information behavior are often advocated by researchers of human information behavior. The expression human information behavior itself accounts for a shift in information studies from a system-centered to a user-centered approach ( Wilson, 2000;
Case, 2002, p. 6 ). Focusing on the user implies considering the situation and the context in which they search, use, or avoid information. Solomon (2002) shows how information discovery takes place in an intricacy of contextual factors, which include structures, processes, and situational dimensions. Kelly (2006, 2006a) reviews extensively research literature into information seeking context, discussing those factors that the liter-ature regards as influential in information seeking, namely task, stage, topic knowledge, and time. The need to consider contextual circumstances when studying information behavior is equally stressed in studies of infor-mation seeking on the web ( Kari &amp; Savolainen, 2003; Martzoukou, 2004 ). As our study is dealing with a soft-ware engineer, it has to be pointed out that the 4 contextual factors listed by Kelly (2006, 2006a) have been considered to different extents in previous research into the information behavior of engineers and software engineers, especially the concept of task ( Leckie, Pettigrew, &amp; Sylvain, 1996 ). Significantly, Freund, Toms, and Clarke (2005) looked at the significance of task in relation to genre in a large high-tech corporation, con-cluding that there is a relationship between genre and task or purpose, and that contextual factors heavily determine information use.

In short, information science research into genres has paid limited attention to the situational and contex-tual factors of genre use, which are crucial for genre identification and classification. In this perspective, it seems advantageous to us an approach to genre that takes in information behavior because this research area points precisely to the situational and contextual variables that influence information behaviors, in general and for specific user groups such as engineers. Such a combined approach provides a reference context for classifying genres, and can cast some light on information use as well.

Based on these assumptions, the aim of the study is looking at how specific web genres relate to the infor-mation needs of the software engineer under scrutiny; which role these web genres play in his information behavior, individually and synergistically; and how the information gathered in web genres is incorporated into the participant X  X  knowledge base. The expected result is a genre system ,in Saunder and Chiasson X  X  terms (2005) , centered around a representative of a professional category, the software engineer who has taken part in the research. This genre system should document the participant X  X  information behavior when he has access to Internet-based resources for work-related purposes. 2. Method
A case study seemed to us the best approach to deal with the research question because it allows for dif-ferent data collection techniques and helps convey the needed contextual factors. Methodological diversity such as that afforded by case studies seems to be an emerging trend in web information seeking research ( Mar-tzoukou, 2004 ).

We studied a single participant, combining a set of two interviews with the analysis of his web browser his-tory. The browser history was used to classify the viewed pages as web genres. Complementarily, the inter-views served to get a picture of the contextual factors of the participant X  X  information behavior and to understand with which purpose he used the web genres classified. Further details are reported in the next sections. 2.1. Web browser history
A web browser history can be obtained from the View option of the Internet Explorer bar, which includes the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) of the viewed web pages over a certain period. The browser history studied here was extracted from the participant X  X  PC. It was converted to an Excel file with a program specif-ically developed for that purpose, and transferred to the researcher. It covered a period of 12 working days between January 19th and February 5th 2007, including 1752 URLs. Of the 1752 URLs available, 605 could not be coded, as reported in Table 1 . Thus, 1148 pages were coded and classified as web genres in total.
All valid URLs and the corresponding web pages were coded firstly as coming from a certain website, and then as web genres. These two operations presented some technical challenges. The problem of identifying units of measure when counting objects on the web is widely discussed in Thelwall, Vaughan, and Bjo  X  rneborn (2005, pp. 91 X 92) . It is difficult to decide what exactly a web page is, because a single web page can consist of multiple files, if the frameset HTML tag is used, or an author may choose to distribute a single document on several pages. These problems are reflected in the literature on genre, which sometimes regards entire websites as web genres like in the case of digital newspapers or weblogs. These websites, however, may contain different other web pages or web genres. We decided to classify each URL as a web page or web genre, specifying also the websites from which they originated. There may be a relationship between certain web genres and the web-sites that host them. For us, it was important not to miss the potential new insight into the relationship between sites and genres. A web site was coded any time it had a distinguishable host, or had a clear individual purpose and audience even if it was somehow linked to another host. For example, we regarded http://devel-oper.nokia.com as a developer resource website, and www.nokia.com as a vendor site. In classifying web sites, we considered more important than the single occurrences their nature, objectives, and senders versus intended recipients. The classification of the sites is to a certain extent subjective, being based on content analysis of the information provided either in the homepage or in the brief summary accompanying the website hit in a search result page. To guarantee the participant X  X  privacy, we do not provide any list of the websites but simply a summary of their general nature.

In classifying the browser history, the main purpose was clarity, as the resulting web genre classification was intended for use in the following stage of the research. Differently from Haas and Grams (2000, p. 186) who opted for looking at web types as  X  X  X omponents of pages, which may occur singly or in combination  X  ,we coded each page as a single instance of a web genre. When it was impossible to establish exactly the genre of a page, even after careful examination, we simply did not categorize the web page as a web genre.
Previous research work was considered during the classification of web pages into web genres. The litera-ture agrees that a web genre is recognizable for a combination of form, content, and social purpose, plus certain functionalities offered by the medium. Crowston and Kwasnik (2004) propose a facetted analysis to classify genre, and suggest considering, besides the factors mentioned above, source, style, implied use, and the relationship of a document with other documents. In more practical terms, Freund, Clarke, and Toms (2006) classification of genres in a software engineering working context was especially relevant. More specific studies of single web genres were also of help to our classification, to name consistently each web page, and to recognize specific features of certain web genres. The following studies were especially useful: Luzo  X  n Marco (2002), Roberts (1998) and Ryan et al. (2003) for homepages; Herring, Scheidt, Bonus, and Wright (2004, 2005) for weblogs; Pollach (2006) for reviews; Emigh and Herring (2005) for wikis and online encyclopedias; Hendry and Carlyle (2006) and Hendry et al. (2006) for hotlists and collaborative bibliographies.
According to ( Santini et al., 2006 ), another feature characterizing genres is the name that intended users and producers assign to them. These names were taken advantage of in our classification. Sometimes, the resource name used in the URLs supplied the terminology necessary to code certain genres. Information con-tained in URLs is used for classification purposes in Shih and Karger (2004) . In their work, the three-struc-tured nature of URLs is used to recognize web advertising and recommend interesting news to potential readers. Some other times, it was the page content itself to provide us with a valid name for the web page under scrutiny. For example, the sentence  X  X  X his article applies to ...  X  made us decide to classify an unclear page as an article. Finally, the solutions suggested by the participant himself were also useful, when he revised the preliminary classification during the second interview.

We do not know of a similar analysis of a browser history, and the research is intended to provide some insight into the potentiality of the methodology as well. There are three aspects we would like to clarify.
Firstly, the extent to which the number of occurrences of certain web genres in the corpus corresponds to the importance the user attaches to them. Secondly, the number of URLs that should be analyzed to achieve a sufficiently detailed list of web genres, enough to reflect the genre system in use in a specific circumstance.
And finally, as mentioned, the existence of a relationship between certain web genres and websites. 2.2. Interviews
Two interviews complemented the classification of the browser history. The first interview took place before the analysis of the browser X  X  history with the purpose of providing a background for such analysis. The semi-structured interview was prepared taking into account some of the social factors mentioned in Hargittai and
Hinnant (2006) , and the contextual factors of information seeking described by Kelly (2006, 2006a) . In par-ticular, we considered the way these contextual factors are discussed in the more specific literature dealing with the information behavior of engineers. Among the most recent contributions, we relied on the following: ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004; Hertzum &amp; Pejtersen, 2000; Hirsh &amp; Dinkelacker, 2004 ). Hirsh and Dinkelacker (2004) report on a study conducted in a large IT company, with special emphasis on the use of Internet-based information and changes in information habits following the company merger with another company. Fidel and Green (2004) elaborate on the concept of accessibility , after extensive interviews with a group of engineers.
Finally, Hertzum and Pejtersen (2000) discuss the engineers X  preference for oral communication, and their reli-ance on colleagues as sources of information.

Based on these previous studies, in the first interview we asked for: demographical characteristics of the participant, his work context, his social support net, and the goal and purposes of his information behavior, including both information seeking and avoidance. The participant also provided explanations about the information sources he relies on and the way he uses Internet-based sources. The semi-structured interview was carried out by phone in two sessions lasting approximately 30 minutes each. It was recorded and imme-diately transcribed.

The second interview (approximately 2 h long, distributed in two sessions) followed the browser X  X  history analysis. In this interview, one researcher discussed a preliminary set of 23 web genres with the participant. His opinion was taken into account to revise such classification. A major change following this interview was cod-ing  X  X  X ser guides  X  separately from  X  X  X ocumentation  X  , and to split documentation into two sub-genres  X  X  X egal documentation  X  and  X  X  X echnical documentation  X  . The term documentation may suit the web genres coded in this study, but may result too vague when looking at the whole area of software engineering. Forward and Lethbridge (2002) include different document types under documentation, such as requirements, specifications, detailed design, etc., and claim that different types of documents may be needed at different stages of a project. However, for the purpose of this study technical and legal documentation seem fair enough. More details on this are available both in the Section 3 and in Appendix .

For each web genre, the participant explained his purpose for looking at it, how he used the information conveyed in it, and if he took advantage of specific functionalities such as linking or posting comments. Fur-ther general questions were asked about the combined use of some web genres and the way he assesses the quality of the information provided. 2.3. Ethical issues
The participant was informed about the purpose of the research at the very beginning of the project. He extracted the browser history from his PC himself, and supplied it voluntarily to the researcher. The nature of the web resources included in his browser history is revealed to a minor extent, and before the research con-tents were made public, he read the research report. Consequently, minor changes were made such as rephras-ing some of his statements, and adjusting the web genres classification as explained. 3. Results 3.1. First interview
In the first interview, the participant introduced himself, the company for which he works, the tasks he rou-tinely performs, and also commented on his information habits. Some sentences are taken directly from the participant X  X  statements, and are thus reported in quotation marks.

The participant and his role . He is a 35-year-old male with 12 years of working experience in software engi-neering on an international level, having worked in three different European countries. He has a dual profes-sional profile, as he used to work as a software engineer, but has more recently taken over functions of a software architect. This means that, instead of being responsible for the design of two or three system com-ponents, he takes a more holistic view on the system. This professional shift has paralleled a shift in the com-pany, which has moved from using only Microsoft-baked products to using different third party products including open source software.

Tasks . As a software architect, he looks at all different processes and divisions of a system design, basically at how they talk to each other in a more cohesive way. When third party products are used, he has to make sure that products are compatible with each other and with the hardware standards the company works with.
The company . It is a medium-size IT company, which counts a thousand employees approximately, and is specialized in network security and digital right management. The participant is working in a branch based in the Netherlands, where two engineering teams are hosted. The one he belongs to, counts four engineers.
Colleagues and social support network . In the Netherlands, the physical proximity to his colleagues makes it easy to shout questions at one another. This happens only sporadically. For more lengthy detailed matters such as design issue problems, a meeting is arranged in advance. He has less contact with a second team based in the Dutch branch, even if they do a very similar job in a different line of technology. Outside the company, he basically relies on three kinds of people for information: (1) people in other companies that happen to know something about the field he is working in; (2) companies with which they have a support contract; and (3) communities and user groups over the Internet. Communication in all these cases is mostly computer-mediated.

Information sources . The shift from primarily using Microsoft products to more open standards has basi-cally changed the way he conducts searches and looks things up. Microsoft offers a comprehensive source of information with a Help System for its own products. This means that it is not even necessary to go online to solve certain problems, as looking at the help files that come with the product suffices. Switching to more open source standards basically means that the information is not concentrated in a single place, but spread over many sources. These information sources are practically all Internet-based, including other vendors X  help sys-tems; people X  X  sites that host information on the technology he is interested in; open source projects; and dis-cussion groups.

Internally, the company-based information sources he relies on are primarily other colleagues. The project manager, for example, filters the information he needs about the customers in the form of requirements. From his software engineer colleagues he obtains information of two types: (1) quick answers to technical questions about issues others are more familiar with; and (2) feedback and comments on design documents. Brainstorm-ing with colleagues allows him to get design ideas and more conceptual hints. A company intranet repository is available, which is not geared towards engineering, but more oriented towards processes and practices, and is thus of little help to him.

Using the Internet . He uses the Internet for information purposes on average 2 h a day, of time greatly varies depending on how  X  X  X lear  X  things are. Investigating things or using documents on the
Internet can lead to an entire afternoon spent online. However, even on a day when things are quite clear, he does use the Internet as a quick way to find answers,  X  X  X or lots of sporadic bursts  X  .  X  X  X or example, if you see an error code, [ ... ] you just quickly enter it into Google just to see if the error code pops up some-thing  X  . Results and the time spent searching vary greatly, and depend on the complexity or abstractedness of the problem.

Assessing quality . The way he assesses the quality and reliability of the sources he looks into varies accord-ing to the sources themselves. Vendors X  development networks such as Microsoft X  X , are reliable 90% of the times. Other developers X  resources, depending on the vendor, the company that is running them, or on the familiarity with the technology, are reliable in 60% of the cases. With newsgroups, finally, it is really a gamble, and he needs to review them thoroughly.

Information seeking . Working with a more diversified gamut of products than when the company used to rely exclusively on Microsoft technologies, vendor support engineers can rarely solve a problem. Outside the vendor help systems, which may be very different from each other, information is highly fragmented. Google is kind of  X  X  X n index to all these different sites  X  . Useful answers may come from people in other companies or from user groups and communities over the Internet. In this last case,  X  X  X  ... ] on a historical basis, you search for threads from people who had similar experiences and tend to trace what people are responding to them, read the thread and see if they got anywhere.  X  Information avoidance . Searching for information often leads to commercial sites he would like to avoid.
These sites ask users to subscribe or log-in, but do not guarantee answers to his problems. When it comes to consulting discussion groups, a lot of it is investigation, almost detective work:  X  X  X ou often have to delve into so much information, in this kind of circumstances you can X  X  really avoid things because they might hold something interesting  X  . 3.2. Analysis of the browser history
Twenty-three (23) web genres and ten (10) sub-genres were classified and commented on by the participant in a second interview. The participant spoke primarily about the web genres he uses in his work, and paid almost no attention to other genres, which appeared in his browser history because of his personal interests.
Instead of commenting on each web genre separately, we present first a table with a list of them and the num-ber of their occurrences in total and per website. Fourteen types of websites were found, though in Table 2 they are sometimes grouped together for practical reasons. For instance, under  X  X  X eference resources  X  both online encyclopedias and resource sites are included. In Section 3.5, we review these web genres in the context of the explanations given by the participant. Additionally, in Appendix , the reader can find a brief explanation about each web genre.

Commenting on the browser history, the participant observed that it corresponds to a research-intensive phase, and that the list of web genres seemed comprehensive enough to him. However, the list remains pre-liminary and applies only to the participant in this study. Stylos and Myers (2006) , for example, in a similar work on Internet-based resources used by a group of programmers, mention some other web genres such as example programs. Nonetheless, they do not conceptualize these Internet-based resources as genres. 3.3. Methodological implications
The set of 23 web genres and 10 sub-genres was obtained after the analysis of 7 of the 12 working days included in the browser history (corresponding to 1319 URLs), as reported in Table 3 .

Regarding the extent to which the number of occurrences reflects the actual importance of web genres for the user, in general, the quantitative results corresponded to the participant X  X  opinion about the importance of each web genre. However, there are some observations to make. Firstly, it is possible that the participant looks at a web genre several times without using it or spending much time on it, or even without consciously looking for it. For instance, we recorded a considerable score for  X  X  X bout pages  X  (27 URLs), but he stated that he hardly ever looks at them. Secondly, it is difficult to say to what extent the researcher X  X  classification has influ-enced the participant X  X  explanations about the web genres. For example, we found that most, though not all, announcement pages in the browser history made public some cultural events, whilst the participant com-mented on announcement pages of software and hardware vendors, which are scarcely represented in the browser history.

All the same, in general, the scores of each web genre are in agreement with the importance the participant attached to each of them. This is shown, for instance, by the high score of search result pages and threads, that the participant regarded as highly important to his work. By contrast, the participant complained about the rarity of mailing list archives and resource pages, which had a relatively lower impact in the browser history analysis.

We can say that a relationship between certain web genres and the website that host them may exist, though this study cannot provide decisive data. However, we can still make two further observations. Firstly, some web genres seem to be more common in highly structured, well designed sites, like those of vendors. This is the case, for instance, of  X  X  X bout pages  X  or indexes, but the difference with open source projects is not always so pronounced, as is possible to see in Table 2 above. Index pages appear 42 times on vendors X  websites, and 35 times on open source websites.

Secondly, mailing list archives and resource pages are more common web genres on individual websites and/or open source, as shown in Table 4 . These two web genres occur rarely in comparison with others such as threads or encyclopedia entries, which is little surprise. Considering that the participant was investigating quite a specific area, one can expect that there are not many such resources available. Nonetheless, the types of sites on which they tend to be based are worth some attention. 3.4. Web genres in context
Results from the classification of the web browser history are presented here in the framework of the par-ticipant X  X  explanations. In particular, the web genres reported in Table 2 above and in Appendix are discussed from the following points of view:  X  The purpose or purposes they may serve in the participant X  X  work.  X  The work stages and search stages in which they serve a purpose.  X  The way they combine with each other. 3.4.1. Purpose of web genres
The web genres used by the participant in his work process can be grouped under four general purposes. It is important to remind that the purposes are not necessarily intrinsic to the web genres themselves, but assigned to them by the participant at different stages of his work. He reads or looks at certain web genres: (a) With no clearly focused purpose , out of curiosity or for fun, or to build up common knowledge. For (b) For orientation . Orientation is provided by navigational pages , with indexes and homepages, on the one (c) To get directions or an introduction to something. Some technical articles, for instance, differently from (d) To get specific answers , including how to do something. FAQs, threads, technical and legal documenta-
User guides and other reference documentation help him to understand how a specific product works. Dif-ferently from other types of technical documentation like specification documents, user guides are something that you are constantly using, like a dictionary or a reference book. Other types of technical documentation and specifications are used once at the beginning when you have to make sure that your requirements are met.
Whilst legal and technical documentation appear often in a print-like format (often PDF), user guides usually take advantage of the HTML model. They are  X  X  X avigable  X  , with lots of interconnected links, referencing back to one another, and the user drawing heavily on the index and the content page. Threads and user guides, thus, may require considerable time for reading, scanning, and navigating.

The same web genre can sometimes accomplish different purposes under different circumstances, such as in the case of wikis or encyclopedia entries. They may answer a specific question, when used to get definitions, especially of concepts or of acronyms. Other times, wikis or encyclopedia entries provide a good introduction to a relatively new concept. Finally, he may be reading them to know more about some authors, and in this case they satisfy his curiosity. Discussion group threads and blogs may also be used in two ways, either to get some inspirational clues, when they report people X  X  opinions, or to obtain specific answers from other people X  X  experiences. The same is true for technical articles. Depending on their focus, they may either provide orien-tation and recommendations to solve a problem, or discuss all technical aspects of a single product, thus sup-plying practical answers. 3.4.2. Stages in the work and in the search process
Both the work and the search process of the participant in this study develop in stages. In the work process, we can roughly distinguish a design pre-search phase, a design search proper phase, a development phase, and a post-development phase. At the beginning of a project, the participant relies mostly on colleagues both to obtain information about the customer, and to evaluate the possible design alternatives. We did not record any web genres used at this stage, probably because other genres than web genres serve for communication.
His active search for information concentrates in the search proper phase, which is almost exclusively devoted to seeking information. The aim of his search is making a decision about which products to use and incorpo-rate in the working design document. Once the decision is made and the participant switches to development and implementation, he still searches for information but differently. The need to search becomes less signif-icant when approaching the completion of the product. Finally, after the product has been completed, the par-ticipant does not look actively for information, though he is still receptive to it when he is prompted. The web genres or the combinations of web genres used vary along the work process and the search process, according to the changing tasks and information needs.

At the beginning of the search proper phase, when our participant does not yet know which products to incorporate in the system design, he is mainly interested in high-level product information. Thus, he looks for and uses web genres that give him directions or introduction, usually searching through search engines, mostly Google. At this stage, he may have a look at web genres such as brochures and information pages, which he understands as overview introductory pages. Since he is exploring and does not yet know which product to use, information pages are sometimes bookmarked and classified. At a later stage, he can reference back to them if he needs to. He looks suspiciously at brochures because they are sale-oriented and sometimes misleading. They may list a series of high-level features that impress a non-technical reader such as a decision maker in a company. A technical reader looks at more low-level technical documentation to find out if the product can actually do what is promised in the brochure.

Therefore, technical documentation, such as specification documents, is what the participant looks at in a second stage of his search process. In this phase, he has a more clear idea of the products he wants to use, though hasn X  X  made up his mind yet. Technical documentation should definitely confirm that the product he is interested in adjusts to his requirements. At this point, he can also check if the company is allowed to use the product by looking at legal documentation such as use agreements, licenses, etc. Technical and legal doc-umentation, however, does not provide precise instructions on how to use or implement a certain product in practice. They give him a mixture of introduction and specific answers, and act as kind of transitional genres between two work/search stages.

Once our participant has finds that the product meets the requirements and that the company is legally cov-ered, it is time to develop the software and to implement it. The search proper phase is completed, though he still may need to look up information, mostly on how to do things. In the development phase, he tends to give preference to threads from discussion groups that can provide him with other people X  X  experiences, as well as user guides. He constantly uses user guides, and he highly values their navigational features. When he finds an error code or a bug, he turns to discussion groups. It is very relieving to find that somebody else has had the same problem.

After the product has been developed, our participant can be reading announcements or news articles about problems underlying certain products, hot fixes or patches. Consequently, he may inform third parties, if the news or the announcements regard products already in use. At this work stage, he uses web genres with no clearly focused purpose, and he does not search actively anymore.
 Fig. 1 shows the different work stages and the web genres having a main role in each of them.

Not only do the web genres change throughout the four identified work stages, but they are also used dif-ferently: he may give a quick look at information pages or brochures; he scans technical and legal documents to search for specific information; he reviews threads, and he constantly uses user guides. Some web genres have a different purpose at different stages, depending on the nature of their content. There are blogs reporting informal thoughts and opinions that give him broad orientation at the beginning of the search phase. But then more specific blogs convey the experiences of the people using certain products, and can help him at the devel-opment stage when bloggers discuss problems and fixes.

Meaningfully, changing the search/work stage, the participant may also be opting for different search strat-egies. In the explorative phase, he looks for general information and uses a standard search engine, usually
Google, because he wants his search to be comprehensive. Stylos and Myers (2006) explain that programmers X  reliance on Google in the initial explorative phase of their work allows them to obtain effective results even with the use of non-expert terminology. When the participant is developing, on the other hand, he may have very specific problems and in this case the Google discussion group search engine or the table of content of user guides suit him better. It is often through links or other people/sites X  recommendations that he manages to find resource pages or relevant blogs. Finally, with no clearly focused purpose, he may rely on subscribed resources and feeds to get to know about news, announcements, etc. 3.4.3. Web genres combinations
Web genre combinations may be seen at different stages of the project when the participant solves the related information problems by using certain groupings of web genres. However, besides having a part in the same work/search phases, web genres are combined along two other dimensions as well. 1. Combinations through linking . Web genres may be connected to each other through linking. From a home-page, our participant may arrive at an index, read a brochure next, and end in some kind of documentation page, linking from one page to the other. 2. Purposive combinations . Web genres may reinforce the communicative purpose or the communicative pur-poses they have in common. For example, the participant may be using a user guide and may be looking at wikis at the same time in order to clarify certain concepts he does not understand or does not know. In this case, the two web genres jointly reinforce their explanatory nature. Brochures may be used together with other web genres that the participant trusts such as information pages, technical articles, or documentation.
All such web genres have an introductory purpose in common, though brochures have also a promotional purpose, and thus are not 100% trustworthy. Other web genres reinforce their introductory function, cor-recting their potential bias. 4. Discussion The results of this study confirm several previous assumptions about the information behavior of engineers.
The participant in this case study heavily relies on Internet-based information, like the engineers studied recently in Hirsh and Dinkelacker (2004) and Stylos and Myers, 2006. As in Ellis and Haugan (1997) and
Hirsh (1999) , his work develops in stages, being the initial stages the most information-intensive. The Internet resources he uses change as his work unfolds, as Stylos and Myers (2006) point out in their study of a group of software engineers. However, differently from these previous studies, we conceptualize the Internet-based information he uses as a set of web genres, showing that the purpose or task at hand has a bearing on the genres he decides to use. Freund et al. (2005) reached the same conclusion studying genres in the intranet repository of a large high-tech corporation. Studying web genres instead of genres available in an intranet repository gives us a significant insight into the use the participant makes of web-based information, both as an engineer and as an Internet user. From this perspective, we are able to discuss the results further. Table 4 .

Firstly, we can look at the purpose for which the participant in this study uses the web genres in light of previous research into the way people use the Internet. In particular, the web genre purposes classified here can be projected onto some of the activities and methods described respectively in Sellen, Murphy, and Shaw (2002) Morrison, Pirolli, and Card (2001) , as shown in Table 5 .

These authors, however, do not look at the different ways of using the web in a continuum and in the con-text of a certain problem or task to accomplish, even when Sellen et al. (2002) speak of  X  X  X ompound activities  X  .
Kellar, Watters, and Shepherd (2006) do look at the navigation behaviour of web users in relation to the tasks to accomplish (Fact Finding, Information Gathering, Just Browsing, and Transactions), but do not delve into individual users X  needs. In the perspective of a specific problem or task, our user appears to deliberately look for orientation, which does not come to light in Sellen et al. (2002) and Morrison et al. (2001) . None of the activities and methods mentioned in these previous studies match our participant X  X  behavior when he uses web genres specifically for orientation. Even  X  X  X xplore  X  , that Morrison et al. (2001) consider as  X  X  X eneral searching for information  X  , is not triggered by any particular goal.

It is more difficult to compare our model with the web information seeking model developed by Choo, Detlor, and Turnbull (2000), Choo and Marton (2003) . They consider 4 different modes of information seeking on the web characterized by information seeking moves or combinations thereof, paying attention to the navigational actions (bookmarking, linking, browsing, etc.) undertaken at each stage. Navigational actions were not studied in this research. In addition, in Choo and Marton X  X  model, decisions are made only in the  X  X  X ormal search  X  mode, whereas here the web genres used at each stage all lead to making decisions, though of different nature.
A second consideration regards the way web genres are combined with each other. It isn X  X  only the single web genres used at each stage of the work/search process that account for the participant X  X  information behav-ior, but their combinations as well. Web genre combinations are scarcely studied in the literature. On the one hand, genre systems ( Bazerman, 1994;  X  sterlund, 2006 ) or genre repertoires ( Orlikowski &amp; Yates, 1994 ) have been discussed previously but not on the web. On the other hand, Stylos and Myers (2006), Sellen et al. (2002) speak of a need to check Internet information with other sources, but they do not conceptualize these resources as genres. In this study, we found that web genres are combined at different stages of the work pro-cess to solve the problem at hand, either as linking combinations or purposive combinations. The former type of relationships were developed as hyperlinks, which are in a large part an objective property of the web genres themselves. The purposive relationships are more subtle and can be seen only in the context of use of these web genres. In this contextual perspective, web genres combine when they have the same or a similar/complemen-tary purpose, reinforcing each other.

Future research should investigate the extent to which these combinations are specific of the individual studied here or generalizable to a wider user group. Indeed, all these web genres combinations have the poten-tial to provide web usage mining studies with data of a qualitative nature, useful to explain patterns of nav-igation such as those described by Srivastava, Cooley, Deshpande, and Tan (2000) . Web usage research aims to inform design of web-based technologies, by performing quantitative analyses of what people do on the
Internet. Statistics such as page access frequency, and more sophisticated forms of analysis such as  X  X  X inding the common traversal path through a web site  X  ( Cooley, Mobasher, &amp; Srivastava, 1999, p. 5 ) are common methodologies for web usage researchers. A shortcoming of this research area is apparently that it does not provide an insight into the goals of web users, or on the day-to-day context in which web-based activities are carried out ( Sellen et al., 2002 ). For the time being, the associations of web genres found in this study seem to fit in the two types of transactions that Cooley et al. (1999) envisage to perform usage analysis of websites.
They distinguish between auxiliary and content pages, considering the former as any pages that facilitate the browsing of a user looking for information, and the latter as the pages actually containing such information.
They thus distinguish two possible transactions. The auxiliary-content transactions account for  X  X  X he common transversal path through the web site to a given content page  X  , and resemble the combinations though linking described here. Then, the content-only transactions account for  X  X  X ssociations between the content pages of a site, without any information as to the path taken between the pages  X  ( Cooley et al., 1999, pp. 13 X 14 ), and resemble the purposive combinations described here.

When assessing quality, other factors besides web genre combinations come into play, which introduces our third discussion theme. Previous research has stressed the importance of the concept of uncertainty in infor-mation seeking ( Kuhlthau, 1993; Wilson, Ford, Ellis, Foster, &amp; Spink, 2002 ). Uncertainty may probably explain an apparent paradox in the information behavior of the participant in this study. Surprisingly, he seems to mistrust some recognized web genres such as brochures, which are usually made available by ven-dors, while trusting some others such as threads from discussion groups that one would expect him to mis-trust. The sharpness of his problem and the degree of uncertainty may be the reason for this behavior.
When he reads brochures or other vendor information, he may not have yet a clear idea of what he is looking for, and may have still an abstract problem. By contrast, he turns to threads when he needs to answer clear questions. It is the sharpness of the question that gives him the confidence to filter through considerable amounts of information. In other words, the specificity and sharpness of the question reflect his understanding of the problem, and influence his trust to what is not guaranteed by a strict quality control. The relationship uncertainty  X  trust/mistrust can be conceptualized as cognitive uncertainty in terms of Wilson et al. (2002) .
Cognitive uncertainty relates the searcher X  X  knowledge of the domain with different degrees of uncertainty, and especially with the ability to identify problems.

In this sense, the results of this study differ from Hertzum (2002) and some literature about the information behavior of engineers. These differences are covered in this forth discussion theme. Hertzum (2002) claims that trustworthiness and perceived quality account for engineers preferring internal to external sources. Our par-ticipant turns to external sources because he needs a diverse range of expertise that his internal sources of information are unable to provide. In so doing, he searches for information and constantly evaluates it. Even if certain websites such as vendors X  are more trustworthy, his strategy to assess quality also varies depending on his uncertainty, as just discussed, and on the web genres he is dealing with, their specific features, and his previous experience using them. The difference between ours and Hertzum X  X  study is probably due to the size of the companies studied (a medium-size company in our case, and a large software house in Hertzum X  X  case), but it is still significant. It also means that, in the information behavior of our participant, colleagues as sources of information have been replaced by peers , who may be bloggers, people contributing to discussion groups and open source projects, or wiki authors. He interacts with his actual colleagues at the very beginning of his project in the initial design pre-search phase, but relies mostly on other peers when engaged in the actual research stage. Communication with peers is computer-mediated and no longer oral as in previous studies ( Allen, 1977; Hertzum &amp; Pejtersen, 2000 ), and it is codified in web genres. Discussion group threads, for exam-ple, help the participant and other software engineers interact and exchange information in such a way that they find their interlocutors based on common interests and needs. Other web genres such as wikis, resource pages, blogs, or those available on open source projects allow engineers to publish technical information for anybody who may have an interest in it, to accompany the technical information available on vendors X  sites.
Codifying communication in web genres has the advantage that the information exchanged can be archived, updated, improved, and used several times, and that providers and users of such information can access it at any time without interfering in work processes. In this sense, peers are all contributors and users able to access such web genres, both because they have an understanding of the contents discussed, and because they are familiar with the conventions of the genres themselves.

Previous research maintained that engineers chose their information sources based on the principle of least effort and the most accessible source ( Pinelli, 1991; King, Castro, &amp; Jones, 1994 ). More recently, Hirsh and
Dinkelacker (2004) found that engineers chose information sources also based on the amount of time needed to get the desired information. Actually, time-saving is one of the several specifications of accessibility ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ). Accessibility and time-saving, as properties of information sources, have indeed a role in explaining the participant X  X  information behavior and the choice he makes of web genres. However, from the perspective of web genres, accessibility and time-saving acquire a more specific meaning. He highly regards those web genres like indexes, resource pages, and mailing list archives that grant him access to contents at all stages of his work process. These are highly connected web genres, which points to a relationship between accessibility and connectedness of resources on the web. His understanding of accessibility and time-saving seems to vary with the work process as well. At the beginning of the work and search process, some web genres like reviews, presenta-tions, and information and product pages are chosen because of their conciseness and ability to provide an over-view of what he is interested in. However, at more crucial work stages such as the development stage, it is the navigability and/or retrievability of the web genres that spare him time. This is the case of user guides, that are easily navigable, and threads, that can be retrieved from a search engine specifically designed for discussion groups. Based on the results of this study, the accessibility of an information source and its ability to save time appear to depend on its connectedness, the stage of the work process, the task or purpose, and on whether the participant is searching or using information.

Some final considerations should also be made for future research. The literature on the information behav-ior of engineers has traditionally centered around comparisons with scientists (see, for example, Pinelli, 1991 ).
Our software engineer, however, showed some traits that one would regard as typical of a humanist rather than a scientist, such as searching threads on a historical basis , filtering and reviewing considerable amounts of infor-mation, or not discarding information immediately but bookmarking it for a potential later use. Besides, he highly regards those web genres that can convey opinions and/or experiences, such as blogs or threads, that mix up opinions, technical advice, and problem solutions. Nentwich (2003) studied the Internet use of research-ers from different areas, and came up with a similar surprising result. He found a relative popularity of discus-sion groups in history, law and political sciences in comparison with other disciplines he expected to be more keen on using such communication protocols ( Nentwich, 2003, p. 137 ). It is known that software engineering practice attaches considerable importance to experience. Both Schneider (2002), Schneider and von Hunnius (2003) consider that experience in software development and acquisition helps people make informed decisions under uncertainty. On the other hand, the creative effort of software development and research sets software engineering apart from the hard sciences ( Marcos, 2005 ). Future research into the information behavior of soft-ware engineers could benefit from looking at them from a humanistic/historical perspective.

It is probably necessary to explore the role information scientists can have in providing services tailor-made for professional categories such as software engineers. From this point of view, the case of mailing list archives and resource pages is worth some attention. These web genres are discovered mostly following the recommen-dations of some individuals (personal homepages, blogs, threads, etc.), but rarely through a search engine. Hen-dry and Carlyle (2006), Hendry, Jenkins, and McCarthy (2006) show that resource pages on the Internet can be discussed from the point of view of bibliography and collection development, being connected to these schol-arly traditions. However, most of them exist thanks to open source initiatives, and information providers do not play a role at all. Genre theory and web genres studies can have a role in developing information services for software engineers. As a matter of fact, the development of the Cochrane Library , a documentation web resource for physicians available at http://www.cochrane.org/index.htm , centers precisely around one genre: the systematic review article ( Hetherington et al., 2005 ). It isn X  X  within the purpose of this study to explain the role of the Cochrane Library and systematic reviews in supporting physicians, but more information can be found on the website referenced. Sufficient is it to say that it is based on the implications of one genre. 5. Conclusions
The results of this case study are not generalizable, but they show that it is possible to document the infor-mation behavior of a software engineer using Internet-based resources through a set of web genres. Results also reveal that a specific context helps determine the purpose and use of web genres making classification eas-ier to accomplish. The set of web genres achieved gives an insight into the way information is used by a pro-fessional to create new knowledge products. It also accounts for patterns of communication between the participant and his peers. The results become more significant if we take into consideration that automatic genre classifiers can be developed to search for specific web genre, as indicated in the introduction.
Further conclusions can be derived from this case study specifically for genre theory and for research into the information behavior of software engineers. From the point of view of web genres, a classification of the web genres and sub-genres used by the participant in 12 working days has been provided. On the basis of this clas-sification and the participant X  X  comments, it has been possible to look at the web genres from three different perspectives: the informative purposes they serve; the role they have at each stage of the work and search pro-cess; and the way they may be combined. Web genres are used with four different purposes: (a) with no clearly focused purpose, out of curiosity or general interest; (b) for orientation; (c) to get directions or an introduction to something; and (d) to get specific answers, including how to do something. Different web genres and web genre combinations are used at different stages of the work and search process. At different stages, different combinations of web genres take place, being these combinations partly navigational (web genres are hyper-linked to one another), and partly purposive (web genres reinforce the communicative purpose of each other).
Web genre combinations allow to accomplish certain work and search tasks as well, like assessing quality of the Internet-based resources used. The level of trust in the web-based resources looked at depends not only on the web genre combination used but also on the sharpness of the question. The sharper the question and the clearer the objective, the easier it is to assess quality and reliability. We have discussed how these considerations may complement research into web usage, especially for what concerns discovering patterns in the log analysis of navigational behavior.

The information behavior of the software engineer taking part in this research diverges from previous research into the information behavior of engineers. In particular, we saw that his communication is more com-puter-mediated than oral, and codified in web genres; that he relies on peers more than on colleagues at certain stages of his work; and that he draws heavily on external information sources. Finally, we saw that his infor-mative behavior implies a creative effort which builds, to a certain extent, upon historical and experiential data. Acknowledgements

 About pages
About pages and Information pages are introductory as an index page, but they provide more content and are basically textual. About pages focus on the website, its holder (i.e. a company, a developer, etc.), or its main topic or purpose (such as an opensource project, for example), whilst information pages focus on items such as a program, etc. The difference is not always clear. For example, a program can be the purpose for developing a website or an item to be commented on. Thus, information and about pages are presented under the same heading.
 Announcement pages
They include job adverts, or programs, for instance, of a conference or a cultural event. Thus, we under-stand that they make something public or announce some kind of event.
 Articles The articles classified may be either technical articles or news articles.
 Blog entries
Blog entries are sometimes difficult to differentiate from articles, and many blog URLs contain the word  X  X  X rticle  X  . This is partly confirmed by Herring et al. (2004, 2005) . Looking for the antecedents of weblogs, they note that weblogs resemble different other genres such as online journals, or editorials and letters to the edi-tors, especially when they comment on current events.
 Brochures
In this report, brochures are web genres  X  X  X ith content of a largely visual nature and with the main purpose of being advertisements  X  .( Shepherd &amp; Watters, 1999, p. 5 ). They come mostly in PDF format. Documentation
Documentation is either of a legal or of a technical nature. Legal documentation includes documents such as patent license agreement, copyright notices, or use agreements, whilst technical documentation comprises specification documents, procedure documents, or device information documents. Both legal and technical documentation often appear as printed text, i.e. they are arranged in a way that resembles a printed page, and are often available in PDF format.
 Downloads
The download can be either the download page with complementary information (requirements and use, size of the file, FAQs, etc.), or the download interface itself. FAQs and FAQ entries
Lists of FAQs and FAQ entries were classified in the same way, though, in principle, the former could also be seen as indexes.
 Guides
In this group, we have included along with user guides, other types of reference documentation such as how-to X  X , help-pages, tutorials, and read-me X  X . User guides take usually advantage of the HTML model, being in this way navigable documents.
 Homepages
Shepherd et al. (2004) classify homepages into personal, corporate, and organizational. Personal homepages  X  X  X ontain information describing the interests and ambitions of a person  X  , corporate homepages describe  X  X  X he interests and ambitions of companies whose purpose for existing is to make profit through selling some product or service  X  , and finally organization homepages  X  X  X ontain information describing the interests and ambitions of a group (such as a society or religious organization, etc.), where those ambitions do not include making profit through selling some product or service.  X  (2004: p. 237) It is important to point out that throughout the study we referred to the web page, though Shepherd et al. X  X  classification can be extended to the entire website. Index pages
In this study, indexes are all those lists of links within the same site, leading the user to more specific con-tents or, sometimes, to downloadable items. Some of these indexes could be called in a more specific way, as with FAQs. Homepages can be seen as indexes, which is reflected in the way they are named in the correspond-ing URLs. Additionally, indexes of products could have been classified as catalogues, and indexes functioning as navigational tools of larger documents, libraries, or guides, as tables of contents. However, with no previ-ous literature on this topic, we decided to collect all variants together.
 Information pages
See About pages. A blurred difference may exist between  X  X  X nformation pages  X  and  X  X  X roduct pages  X  .We decided to limit the name  X  X  X roduct pages  X  to those pages proceeding from vendors X  sites.
 Interactive pages
Interactive pages allow the user to obtain a certain service by entering data in a form. Crowston and Wil-liams (2000) use the phrase  X  X  X nteractive page  X  in this sense, commenting that they are new web genres resem-bling the interfaces of computer programs. We classified as interactive pages: login interfaces, contact forms, and start search interfaces, but not search result pages.
 Mailing list archive
Mailing list archives collect all contributions from the site users to specific topics, such as problems, pro-grams, etc. They can be seen as index pages, but we decided to classify them apart because the word  X  X  X rchive  X  is often included in the URL, and because we wanted to emphasize the fact that they are classified guides to archival material.
 Others A family tree page and several pages reporting on sport results are represented here.
 Presentations All come in power point format.
 Product pages
Several product pages may develop different aspects of the same product. They emanate from vendor or commercial websites. When the information about a product or item is given in other web resources, we pre-ferred the term information page, as commented previously. The difference between the two may be blurred. Resource pages
The phrase  X  X  X esource page  X  has been introduced by Hendry et al. (2006) for those websites or those ele-ments of a website that contain  X  X  X n organized set of outbound links on a given topic  X  (p. 806). The name  X  X  X otlist  X  is also common, as in Crowston and Williams (2000) .
 Reviews Reviews may contain tables with comparisons between different products.
 Search result page Search results come from general search engines or from searches within single sites.
 Threads
Threads are lists of messages available in discussion groups in the form of questions and answers to a com-mon topic. Their URLs often include the words  X  X  X how Thread  X  and  X  X  X how Post  X  .
 Visual pages &amp; movies Visual pages include screenshots, pictures, and maps. Movies are included here as moving images. Wikis or Encyclopedia entries
Emigh and Herring (2005) refer to entries of online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia or Everything2 as  X  X  X odes  X  . We opted for a different term, because node may imply a hyperlinked structure which is not always available.
