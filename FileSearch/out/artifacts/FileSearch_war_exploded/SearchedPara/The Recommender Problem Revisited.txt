In 2006, Netflix announced a $1M prize competition to advance recommendation algorithms. The recommendation problem was simplified as the accuracy in predicting a user rating measured by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). While that formulation helped get the attention of the re-search community in the area, it may have put an excessive focus on what is simply one of the many possible approaches to recommendations.

In this tutorial we will describe different components of modern recommender systems such as: personalized rank-ing, similarity, explanations, context-awareness, or search as recommendation. We will use the Netflix use case as a driving example of a prototypical industrial-scale recom-mender system that has evolved from focusing on rating pre-diction to full page optimization. We will also review the usage of modern algorithmic approaches that include algo-rithms such as Factorization Machines[9], Restricted Boltz-mann Machines [10], SimRank [7], Deep Neural Networks, or Listwise Learning-to-rank [6, 12, 11].

The original recommendation problem was formulated around the existence of explicit user ratings. However, recommender systems can be built using different kinds of data including implicit behavioral data, social connections, or demograph-ics. In this tutorial we will review the usage of different data types and discuss what the availability of Big Data has brought into the research area.

Finally, and also related to the availability of large quan-tities of data, we will talk about how system and architec-tural decisions play a role in understanding the recommender problem.

While that formulation helped get the attention of the research community in the area, it may have put an excessive focus on what is simply one of possible approaches to recommen-dations. In this tutorial we will describe different compo-nents of modern recommender systems such as: personal-ized ranking, similarity, explanations, context-awareness, or search as recommendation. In the first part, we will use the Netflix use case as a driving example of a prototypical industrial-scale recommender system. We will also review the usage of modern algorithmic approaches that include al-gorithms such as Factorization Machines, Restricted Boltz-mann Machines, SimRank, Deep Neural Networks, or List-wise Learning-to-rank. In the second part, we will focus on the area of context-aware recommendations where the two dimensional user-item recommender problem is turned into an n-dimensional space.
This tutorial targets two different kinds of audience. On the one hand, the tutorial content should appeal to academic researchers who are interested in understanding the practical applications of some of the latest machine learning and data mining approaches for building recommender systems. On the other hand, it will appeal to industry practitioners who want to understand how latest algorithmic approaches can be applied.

The tutorial assumes basic understanding of supervised and non-supervised machine learning approaches. Some prior knowledge of traditional recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering is not required but is encouraged in order to obtain the most out of the tutorial.
 Just as the Netflix Prize helped bring the Recommender Problem into the spotlight of the KDD research commu-nity, we think this tutorial will help expanding the somewhat shallow view the researchers now have of recommender sys-tems. We therefore anticipate a big interest and impact in the KDD community.
