 1.1 Groundwater Resource in China hydrogeology and roughly divided into six hydrogeological zones (Fig. 1) I. The great East Plain: including Songliao Plain and Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, with II. Inner Mongolian Plateau and Loess plateau : an intermediate zone between the III. The Western Inland Basins: consisting of the Hexi Corridor, Zhungeer Basin, IV. The Southeast and Central-South Hilly Land: characterized by widely exposed V. The Southwest Karst Mountainous Area: carbonate rocks distributed extensively, VI. Qing-Zhang Plateau: with an average elevation around 4000 m, aquifers mainly 
The total annual precipitation in China is about 6 X 10 12 m 3 .Groundwater (natural billion m 3 per year. In hilly land groundwater (chiefly in fissure water and karst water), is about 621.3 billion m 3 per year (Table 1). If we divide China into two parts as North China and South China, Table. 2 lists out how the three types of water distribute. 1.2 Development and Utilization of Groundwater m economic development as an important source of water supply and ecological support, especially in north area. According to statistics the average annual extraction of groundwater throughout China is 75.8 billion m 3 as 11.6% of the total groundwater resources. 76% of the exploited groundwater is in flatland and the rest is in hillyland South China. North China Plain is the most intensive area of groundwater extraction. tells the groundwater extraction in China. 
As more water demand from population expansion and rapid development of industry and agriculture, groundwater becomes increasingly significant for water supply. According to an underestimate, 61 among 181 medium-big cities rely on groundwater for water supply, and 40 on joint supply of groundwater and surface water. 20% municipal water supply in China comes from groundwater. In north area, groundwater and it is the primary source of drinking water in rural area. 
Groundwater exploitation in China goes up obviously in the last 30 years. Average exploitation in 1970's is 57.2 billion m 3 per year; in 1980's it amounts to 74.8 billion m per year, and in 1999 it reaches to 111.6 billion m 3 per year. Presently, groundwater percentage in urban water supply has increased to 20% from 14% in early 1980's. 1.3 Groundwater Issues In the absence of a unified planning and strict management system, arbitrary exploitation of groundwater in some regions has led to consistent declines of groundwater level in the area with serious groundwater over-extraction. Over-exploitation of groundwater has been in North China Plain for many years, and also in Guanzhong Plain, Northeast Plain, some watersheds in northwest inland, Yangtze The over-exploited area has reached to 620,000 km 2 involving more than 60 cities. 
Continuous groundwater over-exploitation has caused geo-environment problems or even geo-hazards. In North China Plain and Yangtze River Delta unreasonable groundwater development has caused regional land subsidence.. In Karst area there have occurred 1,400 Karst collapses which are mainly introduced by groundwater groundwater has caused ecological environment deterioration. due to industrial and agricultural activities. 16 principal cities in north area and in 3 in affected the safety of drinking water. In Zibo City of Shandong Province a large well field providing 510 thousand m 3 per day is going to be abandoned because of heavy oil pollution. Even in the capital city of Be ijing, organism with great potential hazards like hexachloro cyclohexane and DDT has been detected in the shallow groundwater. Furthermore, groundwater with high content of arsenic and fluorine, and low content Inner Mongolia suffer from arsenic pollution. 2.1 Current Status At present, groundwater monitoring is chiefly organized by Ministry of Land and Resources. Ministry of Water Resources and Ministry of Construction also conduct partial groundwater monitoring for their specific purpose. 
Ministry of Land and Resources firstly carried out groundwater monitoring in 1950's. After over 50 years' efforts it has built a groundwater monitoring network with groundwater monitoring institutes. The current monitoring wells distributed in the 31 provinces or regions are more than 23,800 controlling an area of nearly 1 million km 2 . agricultural interests. 217 cities consuming groundwater in North China and medium-wells primarily are the boreholes constructed during groundwater resources investigation, and supplemented by all kinds of producing wells, spare wells and disable producing wells. Almost every aquifer is under monitoring and also for some important springs and subterranean rivers. The monitoring contents include groundwater level, temperature, quality, and discharge of springs and subterranean rivers. Groundwater monitoring initially serves groundwater evaluation, development and management. Now its objectives have expanded to prevent groundwater from over-exploitation and pollution, provide information support to environment protection agency, and offer precautions of geo-hazards. 2.2 Contents of Groundwater Monitoring done by the local monitoring agencies. 2.2.1 Water Level It is to measure the static water level and buried depth of groundwater. Besides, in the measured every 10 days in a month, and wells in cities are measured every 5 days in a measured simultaneously. 2.2.2 Water Quality aquifers, and areas with geo-environment problems such as groundwater pollution, seawater intrusion and endemic disease. 50% of level-monitoring wells in regional network and 80% of ones in cities are also for long-term monitoring of water quality. shallow pumped aquifers and areas with big fluctuation of water quality; and once in peak extraction season for the deep pumped aquifers and areas with little fluctuation of water quality. Require items of quality analysis are 20 such as PH, ammonia Mn, TDS, index of KMnO 4 , sulfate, chloride and coliform group. 2.2.3 Temperature term monitoring wells it is measured every 10 days and for wells with auto-monitoring equipments it is measured twice every day. And in other areas temperature is measured once a year accompanying the level measurement in dry season. 2.2.4 Flux of Springs and Subterranean Rivers 0.1~0.5), three times a month for unstable ones (stable coefficient &lt;0.1). 2.3 Monitoring Data Management and Processing The national monitoring institute has developed a system to manage monitoring wells and data. It consists of some thematic databases to store spatial information of wells, borehole and strata information, water level data, temperature data, pumping Then an annual report on groundwater monitoring is accomplished for publication. The system has recently been installed in the provincial monitoring stations one processing. To improve groundwater monitoring, a project is proposed that a more extensive and sophisticated monitoring network, a national groundwater monitoring center, 3 water-budget test fields, and 10,458 new monitoring holes partially fixed with auto-monitoring and data-transmitting machines would be completed. The added prospective monitoring regions. We are highly indebted to our colleagues who heartedly provided the necessary data and references for this paper, Wenbo Liu, Zhiming Li, Aimin Wu, and Cunrong Gao.
