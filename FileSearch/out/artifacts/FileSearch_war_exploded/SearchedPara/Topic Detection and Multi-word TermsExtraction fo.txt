 The continuous growth of Arabic electronic documents leads to increasing attentioninresearchesa nd improvement covering the Arabic Natural Language Processing (ANLP) tasks such as : topic detection and Multi-Word Terms Ex-traction, taking in consideration, particularities and complex morphological composition of the Arabic language.

Topic detection is a very important t ask in NLP. Many researches [1 X 3] have been conducted to improve it and use the obtained results in other NLP tasks such as: categorization, classific ation, QA system, summarizing; speech recognition ... Topic detection is based on supe rvised machine learning using a training corpus to represent each top ic with a specific content obtained by methods including: statistical methods(TF-IDF, Mutual Information, Informa-tion gain ... ), data mining methods(decision tree, neural networks, SVM) and others NLP tasks (summarizing , MWTs extraction).

MWTs Extraction is an important task of Automatic term recognition and is employed in numerous NLP fields such as: tex t mining[4], syntactic parsing [5, 6], Machine Translation[7] and text classification[8]. The MWTs extraction task covers detection and extraction of a cons ecutive set of semantically related words. The technics used in MWTs extraction ca n be classified into four categories:  X  Statistical approaches based on frequency and co-occurrence measures[9].  X  Symbolic approaches using parsers, morphological analysis and patterns[10].  X  Hybrid approaches combining statistical and morphological methods[11, 12].  X  Word alignment approaches[13].
 The hybrid approaches are wildly used since they combine the benefits of sta-tistical and symbolic methods.

Our work is part of the semantic processing of unvowelized Arabic documents and aims to develop a topic detection system for Arabic texts based on machine learning. We constructed Topic Oriented Vocabularies (TOV) based on Mutual Information and classified documents on the basis of Jaccard indicator and an adaptation of the TF-IDF classifier to topic detection. We also implemented a MWTs Extraction prototype based on the hybrid approach, and used MWTs vocabulary in the topic identification.
 This paper is organized as follows: I n section 2 we present related works. In section 3; our topic det ection system is explained. We present the MWTs extraction tool in Section 4. Section 5 details the conducted experiments and obtained results. The last section concludes the paper and announces future works. Works on topic detection for Arabic documents take into consideration the com-plex morphological specificities of the Arabic language. [14] realized a classifi-cation and clustering document syste m based on the extraction of key phrases using statistical methods such as Mutual Information and maximum entropy modelling. [15] used Na X   X ve bayes algorithm to classify unvowelized Arabic web documents and achieved 68.78% in cross validation and 62% in evaluation set experiments. A comparative study between two methods of classification: TF-IDF and SVM by [16] shows that both methods give good results for Arabic documents: TF-IDF achieves results of 90.95% in terms of F-measure. SVM classifier outperforms the results obtained by TF-IDF by more than 7.5%. The experiments of [17] included the study of three statistical methods: the TF-IDF classifier, the SVM method and the Topic Unigram Language Model, and showed the superiority of the SVM classifier and its high capability to distin-guish topics. [18] proposed a study of topic identification for Arabic language by using two methods: the k Nearest Neighbors which is used as a baseline and the TR-Classifier which gives the best performances using reduced size of topic vocabularies with 90% in terms of recall.

Numerous MWTs extraction systems and prototypes have been developed for various languages such as: English, French, Chinese, Turkish, Dutch, urdu ... Few researches have been dedicated to the Arabic language. The authors of [19] explore three approaches: the first one based on crossing correspondence asym-metries between Arabic Wikipedia titles and titles in 21 different languages, the second approach uses translated English MWTs to Arabic language and proceeds to validation. The last one bene fits from large corpora and lexical as-sociation measures. These approaches pro ve to be very efficient for large-scale extraction of Arabic MWTs. [11] created a MWTs extraction tool by adopting the standard approach that combines grammatical patterns and several statis-tical scores: T-Score, FLR, Mutual Information and LLR which gave the best result: 85% in terms of precision. A similar work was presented in[20]: a larger set of patterns was used by introducing the noun definition notion, and using the c-value and LLR metrics. The experiments shows that using a combination of the two previous metrics in ranking MWTs, gives better results than using only one of them. Our developed topic detection system re lies on topic oriented vocabularies to classify Arabic documents. Each topic i s described by a vector of words (vocab-ulary) that represents specifically and accurately the topic [21]. Various methods for generation of vocabulary features w ere proposed in the literature. Although the word frequency is the most intuitive approach, other methods based on probabilistic measurements are more efficient such as: mutual information, gain information, unigram model ... The generated topic oriented vocabularies de-scribe a semantic relationship between words in documents of the same topic. The topic detection System matches documents against the generated TOVs to determine the general topic of each document. The implementation of our sys-tem is based on several phases to identif y and classify the texts according to their general topic. 3.1 Documents Pre-treatment This phase is crucial in order to extract r elevant information. It consists of the following steps:  X  Documents encoding unification: The unification of the encoding ob- X  Documents normalization: Suppression of: Latin words, symbols, num- X  Stop words elimination: Suppression of noisy words by comparing each  X  Roots and stems extraction: Although several articles on classification 3.2 Vocabulary Oriented Topic Generation Our approach is based on the generation o f a specific vocabulary for each topic. The vocabulary is composed by features which define specifically the topic. Var-ious methods are used to create these vocabularies, we used the mutual infor-mation method which measures the influence of a word w on each topic t and attributes the word to the appropriate topic (the one that has the greatest IM value) based on the formula: We calculate the mutual information for each word in the test corpus with each topic. The word will be affected to the topic which gives the maximal value [23]. Finally, we generate six vocabularies specific to each topic of the training corpus by considering for each one the affected words ordered by decreasing mutual information. We considered vocabularies of various lengths: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 1000 and 4000. 3.3 Topic Detection During this phase, we tested our system on the test corpus with 2035 articles belonging to six topics. Each documen t is represented with a vector of words composing it and each topic is represent ed by its vocabulary vector. The topic detection of a new document consists in c alculating the similarity between the vector representing the document and th ose representing the topics. We based our similarity calculus on two approaches: Jaccard indicator and TF-IDF. Jaccard indicator: The Jaccard indicator[24] mea sures the degree of similarity between two documents. The indicator is expressed as: Where m c is the total number of words of the first document, m d represents the total number of words of the second document and m d is the number of common words between the two documents.

The choice of Jaccard indicator is motiv ated by the fact that it employs words in their brut state and thus semantic information is accounted for. TF-IDF: We adapted The classic TF-IDF [25, 26] to construct topics vec-tors. Each Topic is represented by a vector that contains the weights of the topic vocabulary words. the weight of the k th vocabulary word of topic j is t training corpus relative to topic j .Let d fk be the number of documents not relative to topic j in which the word k appears at least once and N the to-tal number of corpus documents. idf k , the inverse document frequency, is given weights of their words. To judge the similarity between a topic t and a document d , we used the cosine similarity: The smaller the  X  is the bigger is the similarity between a test document d and topic t . The topic of highest similarity will be assigned to the test document. Our system is based on the hybrid approach and performs in two major steps: 4.1 Linguistic Filter The linguistic filter has a major importance due to its contribution in the very early selection of MWTs candidate terms. To establish the linguistic filter, we follow these steps: Documents pre-treatment: This task covers the unification of documents encoding to avoid any ambiguity, elimination of Latin words, symbols, numbers, Roman numeral, special characters ... In this step, no morphological treatment is applied on words.
 Stop-word elimination: We eliminate the stop-words using the same stop-word list used previously in the topic detection system. As we are using words with no stemming , we implemented a program that assigns connectors like:  X  in the list. For example:  X  delimit approximately stop-words appearing in documents with variation. Sentence boundary determination: In order to extract MWTs from doc-uments, We implemented a program that breaks up the corpus documents to sentences. The full stop is consider ed to be the sentence delimiter. Document POS-tagging: We assign morphological tickets to the corpus doc-uments sentences using The Stanford Arabic POS Tagger. This step will help us to detect possible MWTs following the patterns bellow:  X  [ Noun ] + .  X  Noun, [ Adjective ] + .  X  Noun,Preposition,Noun .
 In order to extract MWTs vocabulary f or each topic, we compared each two consecutive sentences to detect the set of words repeated in both of them. If the document was composed with one sentence only, we extract the set of words repeated more than once in this sentence. The linguistic filter permit to extract MWTs candidates with various sizes; Bigrams, Trigrams and Four-grams. 4.2 Statistical Filter In order to reduce linguistic ambiguities and increase the ratio of correct ex-tracted MWTs, we adopted a combination of two well known methods for their high effectiveness in MWTs extraction:  X  X -valuemetric[27]: a termhood statistical met hod based on the frequency  X  LLR [28]: a unithood method used to qualif y the association between two We used The C-value metric for the nested words and their variations, the LLR metric was used for the remaining MWTs Bigrams. For the realization of our system, we used a corpus of over 20.291 articles, col-lected from the Arabic newspaper Wattan of the year 2004[18]. The corpus con-tains about 20000 articles covering the six following topics: culture, economics, international, local, religion and sport. We used 90% as a training corpus and 10% to test the prototype. We conducted several experimentations on the test corpus to study and compare the influence of factors such as: the variation of the vocabulary size, the morphological nature of words i.e: stem or root and the use of nouns only.

We used Precision, Recall an d F-measure metrics to evaluate the performances of our realized systems: 5.1 Topic Detection Fig.1 depicts the F-measure metric realized by our proposed topic identifica-tion system using Jaccard Indicator ove r two morphologically distinct corpora. The former was obtained by stemming Wattan documents, while the latter X  X  documents contain only the roots of words. It shows that the developed system realizes higher performances when using the stemmed corpus. The best perfor-mance is obtained for the Local topic with 14.87% of enhancement. To study the impact of removing non-noun words from the corpus on the system performances we used Stanford POS-tagger for Arabic language to identify nouns contained in our corpus and stripped documents from other words.

Fig.2 indicates that the system perfor mances are not affected by this opera-tion. The performance decrease is around 1%. Thus, we conclude that nouns in the Arabic language are more useful to construct VOT than verbs, adjectives, adverbs ... as they hold the essential of semantic information. Statistical classi-fiers such as TF-IDF are widely used in top ic detection liter ature. We compare the performance of the developed syst em for TF-IDF and Jaccard indicator.
Fig.3 indicates that the recall of our system using Jaccard indicator on stemmed documents outperforms the results obtained by TF-IDF except for the culture topic. This can be explained by the fact that the culture topic con-tains numerous words that are shared with other topics and this fact results in classification errors. The F-measure results depicted in Fig.4 correlate with the Recall ones. 5.2 MWTs Extraction To test the performance of our MWTs extraction prototype, we used the manual validation of extracted terms.

The results are showed by Fig.5. Which gives the precision of the developed system according to several size of te rms of the 200 first MWTs extracted with the highest score raking by the combination between C-value and LLR. The average precision of our MWTs extraction system is 90.25%.

To the best of our knowledge, it X  X  the first time an Arabic detection topic sys-tem employs MWTs vocabulary. As shown in Fig.6, the system achieves higher performances for: religion and sports topics. This can be explained by the speci-ficity of the MWTs extracted for these topics and the literature nature of the others topics which produces some ambiguity. The average Precision of our topic detection system with MWTs vocabularies is 84.10%.
 We developed a topic detection system based on topic oriented vocabulary for the Arabic Language using Jaccard indicator and an adapted TF-IDF classifier. Our system manages to achieve 84% of correct ly classified documents over Wattan corpus. We conducted several experiments to improve our system performances. We showed that working with the ste mmed corpus is more efficient than using roots. Also, we found that stripping Wattan corpus from non-noun words does not affect our system performances, the re sulting performan ces decrease is only of 1%. The obtained results prove that the use of Jaccard indicator is judicious in Arabic Language topic detection.

To study the impact of MWTs on topic detection, we built a hybrid proto-type that reaches over 90.25% in term of MWTs extraction precision and cerated a MWTs vocabulary for Topic detection. We were able to extract words with bigrams, trigrams and four-grams. Our Topic detection system achieved a per-formance of 84.10% in term of F-measure when using MWTs vocabulary.
As future works we intend to explore other features such as: Named Entities (NE) to enhance our Topic det ection system performances.
