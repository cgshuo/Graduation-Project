 Learning to rank has emerged as an active and growing area of research both in infor-mation retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML). Many IR problems are by nature ranking problems, and many IR technologies can be potentially enhanced by using learning to rank techniques. These include document retrieval, definition ranking (Xu et al. 2005 ), question answering (Banerjee et al. 2009 ; Surdeanu et al. 2008 ; Verberne et al. 2009 ), multimedia retrieval (Yang et al. 2008a ; Yang et al. 2008b ), text summarization (Metzler et al. 2008 ) and advertisement (Ciaramita et al. 2008 ; Mao 2009 ).

Taking document retrieval as example, the learning to rank process can be described as follows. In the training phase, each query-document pair is represented by a feature vector, and the relevance between the document and the query is given as ground truth. The goal of learning to rank is to automatically learn a ranking model from the training data, such that the model can accurately rank documents by relevance, also for new queries.
In the past years, significant progress has been made on the learning to rank problem and the development of methods.  X  Several major approaches have been proposed, with different loss functions and  X  Benchmark datasets like LETOR (Liu et al. 2007 ) have been released to facilitate the  X  Several activities regarding learning to rank have been organized at major conferences.  X  Learning to rank has also become a key technology in the industry. Several major
Given the increasing impact of learning to rank in both the research community and the industry, we realized the necessity of organizing a special issue of the Journal of Infor-mation Retrieval to discuss the topic. A call for paper was issued on March 6th, 2009. Twenty five papers were received by April 24th, 2009, and each was reviewed by at least three reviewers. Six papers were selected for the special issue based on their qualities. The papers provide different perspectives on the subject and outline the directions for future research. In particular, they try to answer the following important questions.  X  Can one develop more efficient and effective algorithms under the framework of major  X  Can ranking models learned from old data be successfully transferred to new data, or  X  Are all IR measures suitable for direct optimization?  X  Instead of learning from features, can we learn equally effective ranking models from
Chapelle and Keerthi discussed how to improve the efficiency of Ranking SVMs (Joachims 2002 ) in their paper entitled  X  X  Efficient Algorithms for Ranking with SVMs . X  X  So far SVMLight has been the only publicly available software for Ranking SVMs. 3 It is slow and, due to incomplete training with it, previous evaluations show Ranking SVMs to have inferior ranking performance. Chapelle and Keerthi proposed new methods based on the primal Newton method to speed up Ranking SVMs training and show that they are five orders of magnitude faster than SVMLight. Evaluation on the LETOR benchmark datasets after complete training using the methods shows that the performance of Ranking SVMs is excellent.
 In the paper entitled  X  X  Gradient Descent Optimization of Smoothed Information Retrieval Metrics , X  X  Chapelle and Wu proposed a new method to directly optimize IR measures. The basic idea is to minimize a smooth approximation of these measures with gradient descent. Crucial to this kind of approach is the choice of the smoothing factor. Various theoretical analyses were conducted on that choice and an annealing algorithm was proposed to iteratively minimize a less and less smoothed approximation of the measure of interest. Results on the LETOR benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performances.
 Chen et al. argued in their paper entitled  X  X  Knowledge Transfer for Cross Domain Learning to Rank  X  X  that many learning-to-rank applications exist in environments that are subject to rapid change. Training data that was collected in the past can quickly become outdated, since the underlying distribution generating the data changes. Or one may have training data coming from a related, but different domain. For this cross-domain learning to rank problem, they propose two methods based on Ranking SVMs that perform inductive transfer on the feature level and the instance level, respectively.

Wu et al. proposed a new learning-to-rank method that extends LambdaRank to using boosted regression trees as the underlying function class, in the paper entitled  X  X  Ranking, Boosting, and Model Adaptation . X  X  The goal is to maintain LambdaRank X  X  ability to approximately optimize IR measures directly, while improving speed at training and test time. Wu et al. showed that this learning algorithm can naturally exploit existing data from a related task when learning a new task with only little training data. As a special case of the learning-to-rank problem, the paper also gives an algorithm for combining two rankers to optimize a given IR measure.

In the paper  X  X  On the Choice of Effectiveness Measures for Learning to Rank , X  X  Yilmaz and Robertson questioned the current assumption that it is always desirable to directly optimize the target IR measure in learning to rank. They argued that some IR measures may be more  X  X  X nformative X  X  X han others for learning and suggested that even if user sat-isfaction can be measured by an IR measure X, optimizing a search engine based on a different but more informative IR measure Y may actually result in better test performance.
In the paper  X  X  Learning to Rank with (a Lot of) Word Features , X  X  Bai et al. studied learning to rank from a new perspective. Instead of combining different hand-crafted features, they studied how to handle word correlations in the framework of learning to rank. They proposed a supervised semantic indexing algorithm to learn correlations between a query word and a document word. The correlations can be directly used to estimate ranking scores between a query and a document. The authors also proposed methods to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

The above six papers have solved some existing problems in learning to rank, but have also opened new windows to future research. We hope that this special issue can motivate more researchers in IR and ML to work on learning to rank, and further advance the state of the art.
