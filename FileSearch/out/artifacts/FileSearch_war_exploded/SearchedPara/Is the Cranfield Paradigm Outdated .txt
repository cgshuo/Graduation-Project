 The Cranfield paradigm was designed in the early 1960s when information access was via Boolean queries against manually indexed documents and there was (virtually) no text online. Cyril Cleverdon, Librarian of the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield, England, built a test collection that on questions gathered from the researchers, and complete relevance judgments for each query Prof. Gerard Salton and the SMART collections, such as searching MEDLINE abstracts using real questions submitted to MEDLINE, or searching fu ll text TIME articles with real questions from allow valid system comparison, a precursor to the paper by Ellen Voorhees in SIGIR 1998. Implementation of the Cranfield paradigm has unde rgone extensive modifications over the years in partially for commercial evaluations, especially for straight-forward searching tasks where clicks exploded in recent years to encompass online shopping, social networking, personal desktop organization, etc. Is it time to have a new para digm, and if so, how do we ensure that information retrieval evaluation remains scientifically valid? evaluation Donna Harman graduated from Cornell University as an Electrical Engineer, and started her career the first MEDLARS one. Later work was concerne d with searching large volumes of data on relatively small computers, starting with building the IRX system at the National Library of Technology in 1988. In 1990 she was asked by DARPA to put together a real istic test collection on CLEF, NTCIR, INEX, and FIRE, serves as a major testing ground for information retrieval algorithms.
