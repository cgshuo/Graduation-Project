 In this paper, we summarize RecTour 2016  X  a workshop on recommenders in tourism co-located with RecSys 2016. There was a great variety of submissions , i.e., research papers, demo papers and position papers , addressing fundamental challenges of recommen der systems in the tourism domain. The m ain topics included group recommendations , context -aware recommenders, choice-based recommenders and event recommendations .  X  Information systems ! Recommender Systems.
 Tourism recommenders; decision context; on -the -go decisions; discrete choice models, mobile systems; group dec isions. RecTour 2016 focuses on a variety of challenges specific to recommender systems within the tourism domain. In this domain, there are considerably more complicated scenarios than finding the best product for a user. Planning a vacation usually involves searching for a set of products that are interconnected (e.g. means of transportation, lodging, attractions etc.), with a rather limited availability, and where contextual aspects may have a major impact (spatiotemporal context, social context, environmental context) . In addition and most importantly, products are emotionally  X  X oaded X  and experientially based; therefore, decision taking is not based solely on rational and objective criteria (i.e., system 2 thinking) [1 5]. As such, providing the right information to vi sitors of a tourism site at the right time about the site itself and various services nearby is challenging. Additionally, and in contrast to many other domains, information providers are normally small -medium enterprises (SMEs) that do not have full information about available opportunities. Moreover, there is no single, standard format to house this information. Last, much of the tourism experience is co -produced; that is, it occurs during the consumption of the product and therefore, the context of the recommen dation is extremely important [8 ]. Thus, given this diversity, b uilding effective recommender systems within the tourism domain is extremely challenging.
 The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT) in general and the Web has transformed the tourism domain whereby most travelers rely lit tle on travel agents/agencies [14]. Indeed, recent studies indicate that travelers are now active in searching for information and composing their vacation packages according to their specific preferences. When onsite, they search for freely available information about the site itself rather than renting a visitor guide that may be available, but considered to be expensive and sometimes outdated. However, like in many other cases, the bl essing of the web comes with a curse, the curse of information overload. Recommender systems have been suggested as a practical tool for overcoming this information overload. However, the tourism domain is substantially more complicated, and as such, creates huge challenges for those designing tourism -focused recommender s. This workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working in the tourism recommendation domain in order to look at the challenges from the point of view of the user interactions as well as from the perspective of service providers as well as from additional stakeholders (i.e., destination management organizations for instance). Further, the workshop aims at attracting presentations of novel ideas for addressing these challenges with the goal to advance the current state of the art in this field by providing a forum for researchers and practitioners from different fields, e.g., tourism, recommender systems, user modelling, user interaction, mobile, ubiquitous and ambient technologies, artificial intelligence and web information systems, to explore various practical use cases of applications of these technologies in tourist recommender systems of the future. The overall goal of the workshop is to identify and discuss in de pth various user groups, tasks and roles needed to achieve personalization, as to further enhance recommendations for tourism applications. Further details and a link to the workshop proceedings can be found at the website of the workshop. 1 The workshop starts with a keynote presentation by Prof. Hannes Werthner, head of the E -Commerce G roup and dean of the Faculty of Informatics at TU Wien, Austria, who is one of the leading researchers and a distinct expert in the area of e-tourism. In his talk he addresses specific challenges in the context of recommenders and tourism and discusses novels way to implicitly elicit user preferences for tourism products such as the picture -based approach [10 ]. The following summarizes the various papers presented at the workshop. Group recommender systems have become an important focus as social media support social systems wherein many activities are typically done within groups. This is particularly true for travel, http://www.ec.tuwien.ac.at/rectour2016 which is often a social activity. Delic et al. [2 ] discuss challenges of performing group research to understand the dynamics of group decisions and their integ ration into group recommenders . A user study is presented that examines the group decision process and the b enefits and potential shortcomings of such studies are addressed and the implications on the design of group recommender systems are outlined. One of the most important research issues on recommender systems deals with the quest ion of how to incorporate user context when delivering recommendations, in order to improve the results. In this context, the location of the user is taken into account as one important contextual aspect, due to the increasing availability of geo-tagged da ta. Hiesel et al. [6] present an approach for integrating different data sources with check-in information for POIs in order to obtain estimates about the popularity of these POIs in general on the one hand and their popularity conditioned on differ ent tim e and weather conditions on the other hand. Trattner et al. [12 ] consider weather conditions as a contextual aspect for POI recommen dation . In the presented work they show that taking weather data into account clearly improves the state -of-the -art Rank -GeoFM algorithm. Kaya and Bridge [7 ] present an approach for recommending photo -taking locations which improves existing algorithms wherein they integrate map locations of geo-tagged photos and a grid using a geo -hashing algorithm based on the assumption t hat users prefer locations that are close to current photo-taking locations. Vakeel and Ray [ 13], on the other hand, define motivation as a contextual factor that can be used to explain the delivered recommendation to the user. They distinguish seven motiv ations of users for ch ecking-in at different POIs as a basis for a post -filter ing approach . Sanchez Vila [1 1] proposes a recommender approach based on choice and utility theory in order to overcome some limitations of rating -based approaches, i.e., these approaches are mainly based on heuristic models rather than decision -making theories and rely on post -experience utilities, i.e., ratings, rather than pre -experience utilities. The introduced models are evaluated with the help of g astronomy datasets and improve the prediction accuracy of state -of-the -art rating -based methods. Providing recommendations for events is particularly challenging as events usually have a limited duration and previous rating s and behaviors of users might not be relevant for new events . In the workshop, two mobile applications are demonstrated that aim to overcome certain problems in this context. Donohue et al. [3 ] present an application that aims at dealing with the cold -start problem for event recommendations. The idea is to allow the user to set-up their preferences in a fast and non -intrusive way to receive interesting recommendations immediately. MacLachlan et al. [9 ] showcase a mobile application that allows users to access recommendations in different ways, i.e., searching, browsing categories, following, and finally, obtaining recommend ations in a traditional manner, which acknowledges the fact that users have different information needs and preferen ces at different times. The workshop concludes with a panel discussion based upon three position papers [1], [4], [5] which identify and discuss a range of challenges for the development of recommender systems in tourism and outlining important future research directions. The papers and discussion at RecTour 2016 highlight many fundamental challenges for tourism -related recommender systems. They offer thoughtful and useful approaches for addressing these challenges and therefore, provide a substantial foundation for future research. [1] Dareddy, M.R., 2016.
