 Critiquing-based recommenders do not require users to state all of their preferences upfront or rate a set of previously experienced products. Compared to other types of recommenders, they require relatively little user effort, especially initially, despite potential accuracy problems. On the other hand, they rely on a set of critiques to elicit users feedback in order to improve accuracy. Thus the better the critiques are, the more accurately and efficiently the system becomes in generating its recommendations. This method has been successfully applied to high-involvement products. However, it was never tested on public taste products such as music, films, perfumes, fashion goods or wine. Indeed our initial trial adapting traditional critiquing methods to this new domain led to unsatisfactory results. This has motivated us to develop a novel approach named "editorial picked critiques" (EPC) that accounts for users X  needs for popularity information, editorial suggestions, as well as their ne eds for personalization and diversity. Through an empirica l study, we demonstrate that EPC presents a viable recommende r approach and is superior on several dimensions to critiques ge nerated by data mining methods. H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and presentation]: User Interfaces -evaluation/methodology, graphical us er interfaces (GUI), user-centered design. Design, Experimentation, Human Factors Critiquing based recommender system, compound critiques, public taste products, user acceptance of recommenders A critiquing-based recommender system simulates an artificial salesperson. At first, it recomme nds products based on a client X  X  current preferences and then elicits her feedback in the form of critiques such as  X  X  like something cheaper X  or  X  X  like something with faster processor speed X . The critiques were generated with the aim of collecting users X  preferential feedback in order to generate more accurate and pers onalized recommendations in the next interaction cycle . The simplest form of critiquing is called unit critiquing [2]. For example, [CPU Speed: faster] is a unit critique over the CPU speed attribute of the proposed PC. To make the critiquing process more efficient, compound critiques can be dynamically generated to enable users to simultaneously make critiques on several attributes in a given interaction cycle [5]. McCarthy et al. [5] have proposed a method to generate compound critiques using the Apriori algorithm [1], which was originally used in a supermarke t management system. Zhang and Pu [7] presented an approach to generate compound critiques for conversational recommenders with users X  preference models Independently, Chen and Pu [3] proposed a preference-based critique generation method to organize recommended products into several clusters of critiques. Both [3] and [5] generate the cri tiques based on the structure of a product catalog using the Apriori algorithm. They function well for high-involvement products such as PCs, digital cameras, and travel planning where consumers are more motivated to spend a significant amount of time in c hoosing the right product and are more likely to rely on their own judgment in the selection process (hence the name high involvement). Th is is largely due to the fact that a bad decision can result in significant financial losses. However, such methods have no t been applied to public taste goods, such as music, films, pe rfumes and wines, where users spend less time in choosing the products and are more likely to rely on public opinion or experts X  advice to make decisions. For example, Wine.com, a well-rec ognized wine selling website, provides editorial picks by comb ining eight professional ratings on wines such as  X 90+ rated wi nes under $20 X . EPSN, one of the most reputed sports broadcasters , has "Expert Picks" for matches like NFL to give professional op inions to spectators. The MSN consumers make purchase decision in a large number of fields, such as furniture, fragrance, and clothing. Smith at al. [6] showed that users significantly prefer editorial recommendations, especially for utilitarian products. The pres ent research work investigates whether previous work on critiquing based recommendation methods can be directly applied to public taste products. The contribution lies in the development Shopping.msn.com and validation of a new critique generation algorithm, called editorial picked critiques, or EPC, which is more suitable for recommendations of public taste products. The new algorithm combines editorial opinions, popul arity information and critiques comparative user study, we learned that EPC is better in all of the 12 dimensions that were used in the evaluation and 9 of them have p-values less than 0.05. Users X  average rating for EPC X  X  ability to show more attractive items is 21% higher, users X  confidence for purchase is 29% higher and EPC is 2.42 times more preferred than a general recommender. These resu lts help establish that EPC is not only a promising and viable recommender, but also one that significantly improves users' decisi on to purchase due to increased confidence. The application for editorial picked critiques (EPC) was implemented on our group X  X  product brokering website for finding perfume, cosmetics, fashion goods, wines, etc. When a particular product catalog is selected, the we bsite displays a page as shown this page. Users can select any of the five attributes to view a subset of the perfumes. Alternatively, they can view the entire catalog by selecting a sorting criterion such as popularity (default), brand, and price. presented with the product X  X  detail ed information, as well as the results of the editorial picked recommendations on the right hand side under "You may also like  X  in different categories. In our present research, we have c hosen to work with data related to perfumes. They are relatively easy to obtain, they are public taste goods, people buy them more frequently than PCs and digital cameras, and they are sufficiently interesting and complex in terms of the number of features that describe them (brand, price, quantity, etc.) We have thus obtained more than 4000 perfume products with popularity information from a well known e-commerce website. A series of attributes for perfumes from the resulting data was then put together, taking into account the brand, gender, price, quantity, category, popularity and description, and subdivided into 4 categories i.e. "Eau de Parfum", "Eau de Toilette", "Cologne" or "A ftershave"(only for men). Editorial picked critiques are generated by combining editorial opinions (e.g., from popular magazines), popularity information and critiques generated by the Apriori algorithm. In the beginning, we predefine some important unit critique categories that match users X  attention and needs. These categories are put in a ranked preferences. We then produce recommendations for each critique category based on a combined method of dynamic and preference based critiquing methods ([5] and [3] respectively). We identified five critique catego ries for public taste goods. Even though the current method was deve loped for perfume data, it can be generalized for fashion goods, wines, music, a nd films. Each category of critiques is engaged in one aspect of the products. Recommendations are produced from these categories in a top down order. 1. Price-driven critiques . Price is determined as the most important critique for our users. 2. Popularity-driven critiques. The second category is associated with popularity. It is interesting to ask why popularity is put above many other crucial factors. Kim and Chung [4] analyzed this question within their study an d showed that "popularity can provide assurance to buyers, particularly when consumers evaluate products the features of which are not easily compared among alternatives (e.g . automobiles)". Assuming all other factors are equal, consumers reduce risk by purchasing popular models rather than unpopular ones. Second, popularity information, especially those gathered from e-commerce website with a significant amount of traffic, o ffers users a rare opportunity to observe what other people are buying. Third, quality associated with popularity will affect the perception of the brand, and this brand will consequently be more likely to be selected among other alternatives. 3. Diversity-driven critiques. We define the third category according to some common features that provide diversification for the product domain. For perfum e data, it is quantity since the same perfume can exist in differ ent sizes of bottles. Two quantity related critiques are proposed: (1) Same product, but less and cheaper. (2) Same brand, but less and cheaper. For fashion items, we can use features such as color or occasion. For movies and files, genre can be used as the diversification variable. 4. Similarity-driven critiques. In this category, we try to propose something that is similar to the current product. The critique X  X  which corresponds to content-based recommendation rather than social filtering. In the experiment that we present in the next section, we propose perfume that is similar to the current selected one according to their attribute distance. We look for items which have the smallest tradeoff differences in their attributes compared with the current product. 5. Special recommendation. Similar to an editor X  X  special picks, items in this category aim at inspiring users to see more popular items, but those that are slightly more expensive. They provide educational value to users especially when they are not yet familiar with the domain. compound categories: ``more popular and cheaper'' or if this former category does not contain any real products we will use ``more popular but more expensive '', ``same brand and cheaper'' or ``same brand but more expensive'', ``just as popular and cheaper'', ``same price range and just as popular'', and ``people who like this may also like''. 1 The items under "You may also like" are attractive. 2 The items under "You may also like" are educational. 3 The items under "You may also like" appeared to be 4 The items under "You may also like" appeared to be 5 The items under "You may also like" influence my 6 The items under "You may also like" will influence 7 Names of the categories ar e useful and adequate. 8 I am satisfied with the overall quality of the interface. 9 I found the interface easy to use. 10 I would buy the perfume recommended to me, given 11 If it is a real website, I would use it in the future to 12 I would like to introduce this system to my friends.

Would introduce to friends To val idate whether these categories are attractive to users, we conducted a small user study with 7 volunteers with the help of an eye-tracking system. The results show that users indeed paid most attention to price and popularity attributes. They liked products that were  X  X ore popular and cheaper X  the best, followed by the  X  X ame brand and cheaper X , and  X  X imilar popularity and cheaper price X . In addition, they showed interest in products from  X  X eople who like this may also like X . Users also liked information about products with a higher price but superior popularity. To validate our work, we decided to conduct a user study to compare the newly developed algorithm, EPC, with a generalized version of both dynamic and preference based critiquing serving as the baseline. We will call the la tter the Apriori method. A total of 22 participants took part in our experiment in a with-in subject setting. Thus every user experienced both EPC and Apriori in a randomized order. The user task was to find a perfume that she or he was ready to buy. Each participant was told that if she won the lottery of the experiment, she would obtain a 100 Swiss-Franc voucher to buy the selected perfume. The initial adaption of both dynamic and preference based critiqu ing recommenders to public taste data did not give satisfactory results in terms of user acceptance. The categories generated by both methods do not correspond to users X  needs. In this paper, we presented a novel critiquing system, editorial picked critiquing, for recommending perfume which is a typical public taste product. This appr oach combines popularity scores and experts X  choice of critiques. It overcomes some of the limitations of previously developed methods, which all rely on the Apriori data mining method to gene rate critiques. The advantages of EPC are highlighted and validated in a user experiment. More specifically, EPC can significantly improve the quality of recommendations, both in terms of recommendation content and the ease of use of the interface. In addition, the improved quality seems to inspire users X  trust as well as their confidence in the system and help them make the purchase decision. In the future, we like to investigate how this method can be applied to other public taste goods such as wine, f ilms, music, etc. in order to develop a set of design guidelines for the identification and testing of the critique categories. We designed a list of questions to measure users X  subjective perception of the respective recommenders in terms of users X  satisfaction of the recommendati ons (content assessment), the ease of use of the interfaces (interface assessment), and their intention to purchase recommende d products and return to the website in the future (purchase and loyalty) (Table 1). Every question was responded on a 5-point Likert scale from  X  X trongly disagree X  to  X  X trongly agree X . At the end of the questionnaire, users were asked to give their preferences over the two systems: 1) which system was better at recommending perfume to you? and 2) which system did you prefer? We thank the Swiss National Science Foundation for sponsoring the reported research work. We are grateful to the participants of our user studies for their patience and time. We also like to thank the reviewers for their suggestions to improve the clarity of the paper. Table 2 shows the average scores and p-values of subjective variables measured by the questionnaire for the two systems. Figure 3 depicts the scores of each question used in the post study questionnaire. In all dimensions, scores for EPC are higher than those of Apriori and 9 of them have p-values less than 0.05. Scores for the question on purchase ("I would buy given opportunities") is 29% higher for EPC than for Apriori. This result shows that users X  purchasing deci sion is significantly improved by the EPC recommender. In addition, EPC is 21% more attractive, users prefer the names of the categories used in EPC and are more likely to reuse EPC again and in troduce it to their friends, and EPC is 2.42 times more prefer red over a general recommender.
