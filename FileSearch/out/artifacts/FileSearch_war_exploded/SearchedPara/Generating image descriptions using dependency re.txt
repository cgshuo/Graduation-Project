 The number of images tagged with location infor-mation on the web is growing rapidly, facilitated by the availability of GPS (Global Position Sys-tem) equipped cameras and phones, as well as by the widespread use of online social sites. The ma-jority of these images are indexed with GPS coor-dinates (latitude and longitude) only and/or have minimal captions. This typically small amount of textual information associated with the image is of limited usefulness for image indexing, organiza-tion and search. Therefore methods which could automatically supplement the information avail-able for image indexing and lead to improved im-age retrieval would be extremely useful.
 Following the general approach proposed by Aker and Gaizauskas (2009), in this paper we describe a method for automatic image caption-ing or caption enhancement starting with only a scene or subject type and a set of place names per-taining to an image  X  for example  X  church, { St. Paul X  X ,London } X  . Scene type and place names can be obtained automatically given GPS coordinates and compass information using techniques such as those described in Xin et al. (2010)  X  that task is not the focus of this paper.

Our method applies only to images of static fea-tures of the built or natural landscape, i.e. objects with persistent geo-coordinates, such as buildings and mountains, and not to images of objects which move about in such landscapes, e.g. people, cars, clouds, etc. However, our technique is suitable not only for image captioning but in any application context that requires summary descriptions of in-stances of object classes, where the instance is to be characterized in terms of the features typically mentioned in describing members of the class.
Aker and Gaizauskas (2009) have argued that humans appear to have a conceptual model of what is salient regarding a certain object type (e.g. church, bridge, etc.) and that this model informs their choice of what to say when describing an in-stance of this type. They also experimented with representing such conceptual models using n-gram language models derived from corpora consisting of collections of descriptions of instances of spe-cific object types (e.g. a corpus of descriptions of churches, a corpus of bridge descriptions, and so on) and reported results showing that incorporat-ing such n-gram language models as a feature in a feature-based extractive summarizer improves the quality of automatically generated summaries.
The main weakness of n-gram language mod-els is that they only capture very local information about short term sequences and cannot model long distance dependencies between terms. For exam-ple one common and important feature of object descriptions is the simple specification of the ob-ject type, e.g. the information that the object Lon-don Bridge is a bridge or that the Rhine is a river . If this information is expressed as in the first line of Table 1, n-gram language models are likely to reflect it, since one would expect the tri-gram is a bridge to occur with high frequency in a corpus of bridge descriptions. However, if the type predica-tion occurs with less commonly seen local context, as is the case for the object Rhine in the second row of Table 1  X  most important rivers  X  n-gram language models may well be unable to identify it.
Intuitively, what is important in both these cases is that there is a predication whose subject is the object instance of interest and the head of whose complement is the object type: London Bridge ... is ... bridge and Rhine ... is ... river . Sentences matching such patterns are likely to be important ones to include in a summary. This intuition sug-gests that rather than representing object type con-ceptual models via corpus-derived language mod-els as do Aker and Gaizauskas (2009), we do so in-stead using corpus-derived dependency patterns .
We pursue this idea in this paper, our hy-pothesis being that information that is important for describing objects of a given type will fre-quently be realized linguistically via expressions with the same dependency structure. We explore this hypothesis by developing a method for deriv-ing common dependency patterns from object type corpora (Section 2) and then incorporating these patterns into an extractive summarization system (Section 3). In Section 4 we evaluate the approach both by scoring against model summaries and via a readability assessment. Since our work aims to extend the work of Aker and Gaizauskas (2009) we reproduce their experiments with n-gram lan-guage models in the current setting so as to permit accurate comparison.

Multi-document summarizers face the problem of avoiding redundancy: often, important infor-mation which must be included in the summary is repeated several times across the document set, but must be included in the summary only once. We can use the dependency pattern approach to address this problem in a novel way. The com-mon approach to avoiding redundancy is to use a text similarity measure to block the addition of a further sentence to the summary if it is too simi-lar to one already included. Instead, since specific dependency patterns express specific types of in-formation we can group the patterns into groups expressing the same type of information and then, during sentence selection, ensure that sentences matching patterns from different groups are se-lected in order to guarantee broad, non-redundant coverage of information relevant for inclusion in the summary. We report work experimenting with this idea too. 2.1 Object type corpora We derive n-gram language and dependency pat-tern models using object type corpora made avail-able to us by Aker and Gaizauskas. Aker and Gaizauskas (2009) define an object type corpus as a collection of texts about a specific static object type such as church, bridge, etc. Objects can be named locations such as Eiffel Tower . To refer to such names they use the term toponym . To build such object type corpora the authors categorized Wikipedia articles places by object type. The ob-ject type of each article was identified automati-cally by running Is-A patterns over the first five sentences of the article. The authors report 91% accuracy for their categorization process. The most populated of the categories identified (in to-tal 107 containing articles about places around the world) are shown in Table 2. 2.2 N-gram language models Aker and Gaizauskas (2009) experimented with uni-gram and bi-gram language models to capture the features commonly used when describing an object type and used these to bias the sentence se-lection of the summarizer towards the sentences that contain these features. As in Song and Croft (1999) they used their language models in a gener-ative way, i.e. they calculate the probability that a sentence is generated based on a n-gram language model. They showed that summarizer biased with bi-gram language models produced better results than those biased with uni-gram models. We repli-cate the experiments of Aker and Gaizauskas and generate a bi-gram language model for each object type corpus. In later sections we use LM to refer to these models. 2.3 Dependency patterns We use the same object type corpora to derive dependency patterns. Our patterns are derived from dependency trees which are obtained using the Stanford parser 1 . Each article in each ob-ject type corpus was pre-processed by sentence splitting and named entity tagging 2 . Then each sentence was parsed by the Stanford dependency parser to obtain relational patterns. As with the chain model introduced by Sudo et al. (2001) our relational patterns are concentrated on the verbs in the sentences and contain n+1 words (the verb and n words in direct or indirect relation with the verb). The number n is experimentally set to two words.
 For illustration consider the sentence shown in Table 3 that is taken from an article in the bridge corpus. The first two rows of the table show the original sentence and its form after named entity tagging. The next step in processing is to replace any occurrence of a string denoting the object type by the term  X  X BJECTTYPE X  as shown in the third row of Table 3. The final two rows of the table show the output of the Stanford dependency parser and the relational patterns identified for this ex-ample. To obtain the relational patterns from the parser output we first identified the verbs in the output. For each such verb we extracted two fur-ther words being in direct or indirect relation to the current verb. Two words are directly related if they occur in the same relational term. The verb built-4 , for instance, is directly related to DATE-6 because they both are in the same relational term prep-in(built-4, DATE-6) . Two words are indirectly re-lated if they occur in two different terms but are linked by a word that occurs in those two terms. The verb was-3 is, for instance, indirectly related to OBJECTTYPE-2 because they are both in dif-ferent terms but linked with built-4 that occurs in both terms. E.g. for the term nsubjpass(built-4, OBJECTTYPE-2) we use the verb built and ex-tract patterns based on this. OBJECTTYPE is in direct relation to built and The is in indirect rela-tion to built through OBJECTTYPE . So a pattern from these relations is The OBJECTTYPE built . The next pattern extracted from this term is OB-JECTTYPE was built . This pattern is based on di-rect relations. The verb built is in direct relation to OBJECTTYPE and also to was . We continue this until we cover all direct relations with built re-sulting in two more patterns ( OBJECTTYPE built DATE and OBJECTTYPE built W ). It should be noted that we consider all direct and indirect rela-tions while generating the patterns.

Following these steps we extracted relational patterns for each object type corpus along with the frequency of occurrence of the pattern in the en-tire corpus. The frequency values are used by the summarizer to score the sentences. In the follow-ing sections we will use the term DpM to refer to these dependency pattern models. 2.3.1 Pattern categorization In addition to using dependency patterns as mod-els for biasing sentence selection, we can also use them to control the kind of information to be in-cluded in the final summary (see Section 3.2). We may want to ensure that the summary contains a sentence describing the object type of the ob-ject, its location and some background informa-tion. For example, for the object Eiffel Tower we aim to say that it is a tower, located in Paris, de-signed by Gustave Eiffel, etc. To be able to do so, we categorize dependency patterns according to the type of information they express.

We manually analyzed human written descrip-tions about instances of different object types and recorded for each sentence in the descriptions the kind of information it contained about the object. We analyzed descriptions of 310 different objects where each object had up to four different human written descriptions (Section 4.1). We categorized the information contained in the descriptions into the following categories:
We also manually assigned each dependency pattern in each corpus-derived model to one of the above categories, provided it occurred five or more times in the object type corpora. The patterns ex-tracted for our example sentence shown in Table 3, for instance, are all categorized by year category because all of them contain information about the foundation date of an object. We adopted the same overall approach to sum-marization used by Aker and Gaizauskas (2009) to generate the image descriptions. The summa-rizer is an extractive, query-based multi-document summarization system. It is given two inputs: a toponym associated with an image and a set of documents to be summarized which have been re-trieved from the web using the toponym as a query. The summarizer creates image descriptions in a three step process. First, it applies shallow text analysis, including sentence detection, tokeniza-tion, lemmatization and POS-tagging to the given input documents. Then it extracts features from the document sentences. Finally, it combines the features using a linear weighting scheme to com-pute the final score for each sentence and to cre-ate the final summary. We modified the approach to feature extraction and the way the summarizer acquires the weights for feature combination. The following subsections describe how feature extrac-tion/combination is done in more detail. 3.1 Feature Extraction The original summarizer reported in Aker and Gaizauskas (2009) uses the following features to score the sentences:
In our experiments we extend this feature set by two dependency pattern related features: DpMSim and DepCat .
 DpMSim is computed in a similar fashion to LMSim feature. We assign each sentence a depen-dency similarity score. To compute this score, we first parse the sentence on the fly with the Stan-ford parser and obtain the dependency patterns for the sentence. We then associate each dependency pattern of the sentence with the occurrence fre-quency of that pattern in the dependency pattern model ( DpM ). DpMSim is then computed as given in Equation 1. It is a sum of all occurrence fre-quencies of the dependency patterns detected in a sentence S that are also contained in the DpM .
The second feature, DepCat , uses dependency patterns to categorize the sentences rather than ranking them. It can be used independently from other features to categorize each sentence by one of the categories described in Section 2.3.1. To do this, we obtain the relational patterns for the cur-rent sentence, check whether for each such pattern whether it is included in the DpM , and, if so, we add to the sentence the category the pattern was manually associated with. It should be noted that a sentence can have more than one category. This can occur, for instance, if the sentence contains in-formation about when something was built and at the same time where it is located. It is also impor-tant to mention that assigning sentences categories does not change the order in the ranked list.
We use DepCat to generate an automated sum-mary by first including sentences containing the category  X  X ype X , then  X  X ear X  and so on until the summary length is violated. The sentences are se-lected according to the order in which they occur in the ranked list. From each of the first three cat-egories ( X  X ype X ,  X  X ear X  and  X  X ocation X ) we take a single sentence to avoid redundancy. The same is applied to the final two categories ( X  X urrounding X  and  X  X isiting X ). Then, if length limit is not vio-lated, we fill the summary with sentences from the  X  X ackground X  category until the word limit of 200 words is reached. Here the number of added sen-tences is not limited. Finally, we order the sen-tences by first adding the sentences from the first three categories to the summary, then the  X  X ack-ground X  related sentences and finally the last two sentences from the  X  X urrounding X  and  X  X isiting X  categories. However, in cases where we have not reached the summary word limit because of un-covered categories, i.e. there were not, for in-stance, sentences about  X  X ocation X , we add to the end of the summary the next top sentence from the ranked list that was not taken. 3.2 Sentence Selection To compute the final score for each sentence Aker and Gaizauskas (2009) use a linear function with weighted features: We use the same approach, but whereas the fea-ture weights they use are experimentally set rather than learned, we learn the weights using linear re-gression instead. We used 2 3 of the 310 images from our image set (see Section 4.1) to train the weights. The image descriptions from this data set are used as model summaries.

Our training data contains for each image a set of image descriptions taken from the Virtual-Tourist travel community web-site 4 . From this web-site we took all existing image descriptions about a particular image or object. Note that some of these descriptions about a particular object were used to derive the model summaries for that ob-ject (see Section 4.1). Assuming that model sum-maries contain the most relevant sentences about an object we perform ROUGE comparisons be-tween the sentences in all the image descriptions and the model summaries, i.e. we pair each sen-tence from all image descriptions about a particu-lar place with every sentence from all the model summaries for that particular object. Sentences which are exactly the same or have common parts will score higher in ROUGE than sentences which do not have anything in common. In this way, we have for each sentence from all existing image de-scriptions about an object a ROUGE score 5 indi-cating its relevance. We also ran the summarizer for each of these sentences to compute the values for the different features. This gives information about each feature X  X  value for each sentence. Then the ROUGE scores and feature score values for ev-ery sentence were input to the linear regression al-gorithm to train the weights.

Given the weights, Equation 2 is used to com-pute the final score for each sentence. The final sentence scores are used to sort the sentences in the descending order. This sorted list is then used by the summarizer to generate the final summary as described in Aker and Gaizauskas (2009). To evaluate our approach we used two different as-sessment methods: ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and man-ual readability. In the following we first describe the data sets used in each of these evaluations, and then we present the results of each assessment. 4.1 Data sets For evaluation we use the image collection de-scribed in Aker and Gaizauskas (2010). The image collection contains 310 different images with man-ually assigned toponyms. The images cover 60 of the 107 object types identified from Wikipedia (see Table 2). For each image there are up to four short descriptions or model summaries. The model summaries were created manually based on image descriptions taken from VirtualTourist and contain a minimum of 190 and a maximum of 210 words. An example model summary about the Eif-fel Tower is shown in Table 4. 2 3 of this image collection was used to train the weights and the remaining 1 3 (105 images) for evaluation.

To generate automatic captions for the im-ages we automatically retrieved the top 30 related web-documents for each image using the Yahoo! search engine and the toponym associated with the image as a query. The text from these documents was extracted using an HTML parser and passed to the summarizer. The set of documents we used to generate our summaries excluded any Virtual-Tourist related sites, as these were used to generate the model summaries. 4.2 ROUGE assessment In the first assessment we compared the automat-ically generated summaries against model sum-maries written by humans using ROUGE (Lin, 2004). Following the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) evaluation standards we used ROUGE 2 ( R2 ) and ROUGE SU4 ( RSU4 ) as eval-uation metrics (Dang, 2006) . ROUGE 2 gives re-call scores for bi-gram overlap between the auto-matically generated summaries and the reference ones. ROUGE SU4 allows bi-grams to be com-posed of non-contiguous words, with a maximum of four words between the bi-grams.

As baselines for evaluation we used two dif-ferent summary types. Firstly, we generated summaries for each image using the top-ranked non Wikipedia document retrieved in the Yahoo! search results for the given toponyms. From this document we create a baseline summary by select-ing sentences from the beginning until the sum-mary reaches a length of 200 words. As a second baseline we use the Wikipedia article for a given toponym from which we again select sentences from the beginning until the summary length limit is reached.

First, we compared the baseline summaries against the VirtualTourist model summaries. The comparison shows that the Wikipedia baseline ROUGE scores (R2 .097***, RSU4 .14***) are significantly higher than the first document ones (R2 0.042, RSU4 .079) 6 . Thus, we will focus on the Wikipedia baseline summaries to draw con-clusions about our automatic summaries. Table 4 shows the Wikipedia baseline summary about the Eiffel Tower .

Secondly, we separately ran the summarizer over the top ten documents for each single feature and compared the automated summaries against the model ones. The results of this comparison are shown in Table 5.

Table 5 shows that the dependency model fea-ture ( DpMSim ) contributes most to the summary quality according to the ROUGE metrics. It is also significantly better than all other feature scores except the LMSim feature. Compared to LMSim ROUGE scores the DpMSim feature offers only a moderate improvement. The same moderate im-provement we can see between the DpMSim RSU4 and the Wiki RSU4. The lowest ROUGE scores are obtained if only sentence position ( sentecePo-sition ) is used.

To see how the ROUGE scores change when features are combined with each other we per-formed different combinations of the features, ran the summarizer for each combination and compared the automated summaries against the model ones. In the different combinations we also included the dependency pattern categoriza-tion ( DepCat ) feature explained in Section 3.1. Table 6 shows the results of feature combinations which score moderately or significantly higher than the dependency pattern model ( DpMSim ) fea-ture score shown in Table 5.

The results showed that combining DpMSim with other features did not lead to higher ROUGE scores than those produced by that feature alone.
The summaries categorized by dependency pat-terns ( starterSimilarity+LMSim+DepCat ) achieve significantly higher ROUGE scores than the Wikipedia baseline. For both ROUGE R2 and ROUGE SU4 the significance is at level p &lt; . 0001 . Table 4 shows a summary about the Eiffel Tower obtained using this starterSimilar-ity+LMSim+DepCat feature. Table 5 also shows the ROUGE scores of the feature combination starterSimilarity and LMSim used without the de-pendency categorization ( DepCat ) feature. It can be seen that this combination without the depen-dency patterns lead to lower ROUGE scores in ROUGE 2 and only moderate improvement in ROUGE SU4 if compared with Wikipedia base-line ROUGE scores. 4.3 Readability assessment We also evaluated our summaries using a read-ability assessment as in DUC and TAC. DUC and TAC manually assess the quality of automatically generated summaries by asking human subjects to score each summary using five criteria  X  gram-maticality, redundancy, clarity, focus and structure criteria. Each criterion is scored on a five point scale with high scores indicating a better result (Dang, 2005).

For this evaluation we used the same 105 im-ages as in the ROUGE evaluation. As the ROUGE evaluation showed that the dependency pattern categorization ( DepCat ) renders the best results when used in feature combination starterSimilar-ity + LMSim + DepCat , we further investigated the contribution of dependency pattern categoriza-tion by performing a readability assessment on summaries generated using this feature combina-tion. For comparison we also evaluated sum-maries which were not structured by dependency patterns ( starterSimilarity + LMSim ) and also the Wikipedia baseline summaries.
 We asked four people to assess the summaries. Each person was shown all 315 summaries (105 from each summary type) in a random way and was asked to assess them according to the DUC and TAC manual assessment scheme. The results are shown in Table 7.

We see from Table 7 that using dependency pat-terns to categorize the sentences and produce a structured summary helps to obtain better readable summaries. Looking at the 5 and 4 scores the ta-ble shows that the dependency pattern categorized summaries ( SLMD ) have better clarity (85% of the summaries), are more coherent (74% of the sum-maries), contain less redundant information (83% of the summaries) and have better grammar (92% of the summaries) than the ones without depen-dency categorization (80%, 70%, 60%, 84%).

The scores of our automated summaries were better than the Wikipedia baseline summaries in the grammar feature. However, in other features the Wikipedia baseline summaries obtained better scores than our automated summaries. This com-parison show that there is a gap to fill in order to obtain better readable summaries. Our approach has an advantage over related work in automatic image captioning in that it requires only GPS information associated with the image in order to generate captions. Other attempts towards automatic generation of image captions generate captions based on the immediate textual context of the image with or without consideration of image related features such as colour, shape or texture (Deschacht and Moens, 2007; Mori et al., 2000; Barnard and Forsyth, 2001; Duygulu et al., 2002; Barnard et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2004; Feng and La-pata, 2008; Satoh et al., 1999; Berg et al., 2005). However, Marsch &amp; White (2003) argue that the content of an image and its immediate text have little semantic agreement and this can, according to Purves et al. (2008), be misleading to image retrieval. Furthermore, these approaches assume that the image has been obtained from a document. In cases where there is no document associated with the image, which is the scenario we are prin-cipally concerned with, these techniques are not applicable.
Dependency patterns have been exploited in various language processing applications. In in-formation extraction, for instance, dependency patterns have been used to extract relevant in-formation from text resources (Yangarber et al., 2000; Sudo et al., 2001; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2009). However, dependency patterns have not been used extensively in summarization tasks. We are aware only of the work described in Nobata et al. (2002) who used dependency patterns in com-bination with other features to generate extracts in a single document summarization task. The au-thors found that when learning weights in a simple feature weigthing scheme, the weight assigned to dependency patterns was lower than that assigned to other features. The small contribution of the de-pendency patterns may have been due to the small number of documents they used to derive their dependency patterns  X  they gathered dependency patterns from only ten domain specific documents which are unlikely to be sufficient to capture re-peated features in a domain. We have proposed a method by which dependency patterns extracted from corpora of descriptions of instances of particular object types can be used in a multi-document summarizer to automatically gen-erate image descriptions. Our evaluations show that such an approach yields summaries which score more highly than an approach which uses a simpler representation of an object type model in the form of a n-gram language model.

When used as the sole feature for sentence rank-ing, dependency pattern models ( DpMSim ) pro-duced summaries with higher ROUGE scores than those obtained using the features reported in Aker and Gaizauskas (2009). These dependency pat-tern models also achieved a modest improvement over Wikipedia baseline ROUGE SU4. Further-more, we showed that using dependency patterns in combination with features reported in Aker and Gaizauskas to produce a structured summary led to significantly better results than Wikipedia base-line summaries as assessed by ROUGE. However, human assessed readability showed that there is still scope for improvement.

These results indicate that dependency patterns are worth investigating for object focused auto-mated summarization tasks. Such investigations should in particular concentrate on how depen-dency patterns can be used to structure informa-tion within the summary, as our best results were achieved when dependency patterns were used for this purpose.

There are a number of avenues to pursue in fu-ture work. One is to explore how dependency pat-terns could be used to produce generative sum-maries and/or perform sentence trimming. An-other is to investigate how dependency patterns might be automatically clustered into groups ex-pressing similar or related facts, rather than rely-ing on manual categorization of dependency pat-terns into categories such as  X  X ype X ,  X  X ear X , etc. as was done here. Evaluation should be extended to investigate the utility of the automatically gen-erated image descriptions for image retrieval. Fi-nally, we also plan to analyze automated ways for learning information structures (e.g. what is the flow of facts to describe a location) from existing image descriptions to produce better summaries. The research reported was funded by the TRIPOD project supported by the European Commission under the contract No. 045335.
