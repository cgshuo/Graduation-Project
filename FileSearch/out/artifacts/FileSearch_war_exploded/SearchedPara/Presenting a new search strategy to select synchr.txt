 1. Introduction because misdiagnosis leads to prescribe wrong medications and drives a patient into a worse situation. Today about 2% of people has schizophrenia and about 4% has bipolar mood disorder (BMD)which are considered as highly prevalent psychiatric dis-eases that have some similar clinical symptoms such as halluci-nation and delusion ( Semple et al., 2009 ; Sadock and Sadock, 2005 ).For instance, BMD patients normally switch between the manic and depression states and especially during their manic episodes they might become very happy or in contrast behave very aggressively while speak about unreal issues. Similarly, schizophrenic patients in their delusional phase may see or hear sounds of unreal people and communicate with them such that they seriously believe in their perceptions ( Semple et al., 2009 ; Sadock and Sadock, 2005 ; Andrew and Sims, 2003 ).

When these patients spend their delusional episode, an accu-rate diagnosis becomes problematic. Therefore, psychiatrist diag-nosis is almost made according to the DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnostic criteria ( Edward and Gross, 1994 ) which are qualita-tive and present each disease in terms of different clinical symptoms with various scores. As far as qualitative criteria are not very precise; consequently, to take a more accurate decision for differentiating BMD from schizophrenic patients, a reliable quantitative criterion is needed. Here, scalp electroencephalo-gram (EEG) signal, which is a quantitative and reliable physiolo-gical-based data, is considered as the raw data which should be decoded by feature extraction techniques to provide discrimina-tive information for classification of the mental disorders ( Sabeti et al., 2007a ; Sabeti et al., 2007b ; Lu et al., 2006 ; Sabeti et al., 2009 ; Boostani et al., 2009 ).

There are lots of hypothesis about the cause and origination of aforementioned diseases in term s of changes in the brain connec-tions ( Semple et al., 2009 ). Some neurologists believe that seeing or hearing unreal things arises from wrong neuronal connections among different brain lobes. Therefore, many attempts have been made to unveil the hidden connections among the brain parts which typically called synchronization an alysis. These methods translate the interconnections between cort ical and sub-cortical regions and try to decode these synchronous in dexes in terms of phase coupling or amount of co-activation among the recorded channels ( Singer, 2001 ).

Synchronous oscillations of certain types of such assemblies in different frequency bands may demonstrate a wide range of cognitive functionsorbrainpathologiesduetotheirrelationtodifferent perceptual, motor, or cognitive states ( Basar et al., 2001 ; Anokhin neural synchronization among schi zophrenic patients and indicated that steady-state synchronizati on deficits may only occur with the appearance of psychosis and may con tribute to failures of perceptual and cognitive integration. There are several limitations about the performed study in Colleen et al. (2003 ) that should be addressed including: the role of medication, arousal, and genetic risk on neural synchronization.

Since EEG signals behave chaotically but originated from a rule-based system, hence, in analyzing the mental disorders using of nonlinear measures, based on the chaos theory, is of interest ( Matsumoto and Tsuda, 1988 ). Such measures, adopted from the generalized synchronization (GS) concept, analyze the interde-pendence between the amplitudes of two EEG signals in the state space domain. The well-known chaotic-based synchronization methods are robust synchronization (RS) ( Arnhold et al., 1999 ; Quiroga et al., 2002 ) and synchronization likelihood (SL) ( Stam and van Dijk, 2002 ) that have been repeatedly utilized to discover dependencies of different parts of the brain for neurological diseases ( He et al., 2007 ; Quiroga et al., 2002 ). In this way, He et al. (2007) tried to separate sleep stages by measuring EEG synchronization. The main short coming of their research emerged from the low accuracy of sleep stage discrimination using synchronization indexes.

The commonplace non-linear approach to analyzing the func-tional coupling of cortical assemblies is phase synchronization (PS) which unveils the possible nonlinear interdependencies of the EEG signal and focuses on measuring phase dependencies of EEG signals ( Vangelis et al., 2009 ). There is a possibility that the amplitude dependency of two EEG signals remain uncorrelated while their phases can be synchronized ( Pikovsky et al., 2001 ). In this way, Bob et al. (2008) indicated that the level of phase synchronization and coherence, among the pairs of EEG signals, is inversely related to positive and negative symptoms. This study suggests that higher and lower frequencies may play an impor-tant role in connectivity, and also may be related to decreasing or increasing of channels synchronization with specific manifesta-tion of cognitive deficits in schizophrenic patients Bob et al. (2008) .

Venables et al. (2009) evaluated abnormal frequency composi-tion of idle EEG signals to differentiate schizophrenic from BMD individuals. Their achievements indicated that schizophrenic patients exhibited higher brain activities in low frequency bands of their EEGs such as delta, theta, and alpha, while similar anomalies were absent in bipolar disorder patients, in contrast, their EEG power are distributed in higher frequency bands ( Venables et al., 2009 ).Generally, low frequency bands like theta (4 X 8 Hz) can reveal the long range fronto-parietal interactions, means the coupling between distant brain regions which are involved during working memory retention and mental imagery, whereas high frequency bands like gamma ( 4 40 Hz) can demon-strate the short-range interactions as local synchronization dur-ing visual processing ( von Stein and Sarnthein, 2000 ).
In this paper, the state-of-art synchronization schemes are implemented with the objective of providing informative EEG features to classify BMD from schizophrenic patients. Toward achieving this aim, a problem occurs rising from employing large number of synchronization indexes some of which might be redundant or confusing. Therefore, the essential task of this paper is to propose an efficient feature selection method providing low dimensional feature vectors, constructing by discriminative syn-chronization values, to enhance the classification accuracy between the two groups.

Two general types of feature selection methods are called Filter and Wrapper ( Kohavi and John, 1997 ). Wrapper methods use the classification feedback as the fitness criterion to select the features whereas applying high dimensional feature vectors to parametric classifiers impose lots of computational burden. On the other hand, filter-based approaches are mostly utilized where the input dimension is quite high and the classifier cannot be applied to the original feature size. Filters use a selection criterion which is very fast to compute such as mutual information, entropy, and information gain ( Liu Huan, 2005 ; Huang et al., 2008 ).

Hanchuan et al. (2005) presented a selecting scheme according to the maximum statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information termed as mRMR. First, they choose a desired size of candidate features; then, by applying a backward or forward searching method try to find the best feature subset. Im et al. (2011) used a forward feature selection (FFS) method based on information gain for hyper spectral image classification of urban landscapes. Cheng et al. (2011) introduced a conditional mutual information-based feature selection (CMIFS) to take account both synergy and redundancy of features. Since mRMR and CMIFS needs to estimate distribution of data, these algorithms are complex and the efficiency of them is bias to the computational order of the algorithm. On the other hand, these methods consider synergy of features before starting selection of informa-tive attributes as a primary phase.

It seems that if we design a flexible selection strategy which can investigate the interaction among attributes during exploring in feature space, we take advantage of finding a near-optimal subset (a good local-optima) while the complexity is fairly tolerable. Moreover, an efficient feature selection method should explore the feature space such that the interaction among unselected features with the current selected ones is tightly considered through a greedy search. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a novel sequential search strategy, called greedy overall-relevancy (GOR), considering interaction of each feature with the rest of features together. GOR is naturally a Filter -based scheme that selects each attribute using information gain ratio while considering all interactions. GOR is also equipped with a hidden backtracking phase by measuring the overall relevancy of features.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data acquisition and patient specification. Section 3 explains the employed synchronization schemes. Section 4 introduces the proposed GOR method and briefly describes the
AGV algorithm. The classification phase is expressed in Section 5 and Section 6 presents the experimental results. Section 7 discuss and justify the results and compare it with similar research and finally summarized the paper. 2. Data acquisition 2.1. EEG recording and patients specifications
In this study, we recorded EEG signals of 53 subjects of whom 26 patients with schizophrenia and 27 patients with BMD. These subjects were retrospectively selected from the pool of Pediatric Neurology outpatient Clinics of Hafez hospitals in Shiraz, Iran. They were interviewed based on a structural interview and then diagnosed regularly and followed. Their diagnosis was based on clinical and DSM-IV diagnostic criteria ( American Psychiatric
Association, 1994 ). In order to assure about the label of selected patients, just those patients were selecting for signal acquisition that their feedback to their prescribed drug were positive. Exclu-sion criteria for the both groups were a past or current history of substance dependence, clinically estimated mental retardation, significant neurological disorder such as epilepsy, or a history of head injury causing a loss of consciousness for at least 1 h. Table.1 illustrated their characteristics exactly by mean value plus/minus standard deviation.
 siology Laboratory, at the Medical School of the University of Shiraz.
EEG signals from subjects were recorded from 22 scalp electrodes (Fp1,Fp2,Fpz,F3,F4,F7,F8,FZ,C3,C4,CZ,T3,T4,T5,T6,P3,P4,PZ,
O1, O2, A1, A2) with Scan-LT apparatus, according to the 10/20 international system, referred to linked A1  X  A2 electrodes. The signals were amplified using a set o f Contact Precision Instrument amplifiers, filtered online with a band-pass between 0.01 and 40 Hz (40 decibel decay rate of side lobe), and digitized at 250 Hz.
The recorded signals were carefully reviewed by an expert to remove the contaminated parts of the signal. Moreover, after visual inspection oftheexpert,thepossibleremai ned contaminated trials were detected by time regression method ( He et al., 2007 )andremoved. 2.1.1. Test description resting condition and each signal trial took three minutes.
Participants sat in a reclined chair in an electrically shielded room, sound attenuated in day light. No mental task or evoke is considered in this research in order to analyze the natural EEG of the patients. 3. Synchronization methods channels, both linear and nonlinear synchronization methods ( Vangelis et al., 2009 ) including PLV, SL and RS were implemented in this study to elicit features from EEGs of the patients. As we investigated among synchronization studies, methods are mostly estimate the synchronization value between two channels in the time, phase, and state-space domains. By implementing the three mentioned methods, all families of synchronization methods are incorporated to see whether they are able to classify these two groups or not. 3.1. Phase-locking value (PLV) synchronization (PS) methods. This method is based on this fact that two different systems may produce two signals with syn-chronized phase whereas their amplitudes are uncorrelated ( Mormann et al., 2000 ). For two signals x  X  t  X  and y  X  t  X  with instantaneous phases of F x  X  t  X  , F y  X  t  X  with equal time length, the
PS is defined as the difference locking of the phases as: 9
F x  X  t  X  F y  X  t  X  9  X  constan t  X  1  X 
As far as the recorded EEG signals are all real, to estimate the instantaneous phase the Hilbert transform (HT) is utilized to compute their natural imaginary part. If we have an analytical signal H  X  t  X  as H  X  t  X  X  x  X  t  X  X  i ~ x  X  t  X  ,  X  2  X  Its instantaneous phase can be found by F  X  t  X  X  arctan ~ x  X  t  X  x  X  t  X  :  X  3  X 
Thus, ~ x  X  t  X  as the HT of a real signal of x  X  t  X  is determined by ~ x  X  t  X  X  where, PV denotes the Cauchy principal value. Finally, for two signals of x  X  t  X  and y  X  t  X  , the PLV index is calculated as PLV  X  1 N where D t is the sampling step and N is the sample number of each signal. PLV index can take a value within the range of 0 X 1, where 1 indicates perfect PS and 0 demonstrates lack of synchronization. 3.2. Robust state X  X pace generalized synchronization method (RS)
The theory of RS turned out to be the most robust and reliable way of estimating the extent of generalized synchronization (GS) ( Arnhold et al., 1999 ; Quiroga et al., 2002 ). First, the delay vectors ( Takens et al., 1981 ) are reconstructed out of the time series x ( t ) and y ( t ) such as; x n  X  ( x n , y , x n-(m-1) t ) and y where n  X  1, y , N (number of samples), and m , t are the embed-ding dimension and time lag, respectively. Let r n,j and s k , denote the time indices of the k nearest neighbors of x respectively. For each x n , the mean squared Euclidean distance to its k neighbors is defined as n  X  X  X  X  and the Y -conditioned squared mean Euclidean distance R n is defined by replacing the nearest neighbors by the equal time partners of the closest neighbors of y n : n  X  X 9 Y  X  X 
If the set of reconstructed vectors (point cloud x n ) has an average squared radius, R  X  X  X  X  X  1 = N  X  P N n  X  1 R N 1 two systems are strongly correlated, the following approximation pendent the following inequality is valid: R n (k) ( X 9 Y )
R (k) ( X ). Hence, an interdependence measure ca n be defined as ( Arnhold et al., 1999 ):  X  X 9 Y  X  X  values between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates maximum synchroni-zation and 0 shows independence of the signals. Another normal-ized and more robust version of S is repeatedly used ( Quiroga et al., 2002 ) and defines as k  X   X  X 9 Y  X  X  1
In this study, the following parameters were found suitable through the cross validation: t  X  20; m  X  10; and k  X  10to comput-ing the RS. 3.3. Synchronization likelihood (SL)
Synchronization likelihood (SL) is an unbiased normalized synchronization estimator that represents a normalized version of mutual information ( Stam and van Dijk, 2002 ). Let x n y be the state variables of the two signals x ( t ) and y ( t ), achieving by the two different time delays of their original signals. SL actually tries to measure the correlation of the two signals trajectories in the state X  X pace domain. Thus, we require a small threshold e x , to measure likelihood of x n and x v . In other words, e determines whether the likelihood of two randomly chosen vectors from x ( t ) is equal to a fixed number ( p ref ) or not. SL between x ( t ) and y ( t ) at time n is defined as follows: SL where, N 0  X  2(w2 w1 1)p ref , O : O is the Euclidean distance, and y is the Heaviside step function, where y ( x )  X  0if x r 0 unless y ( x )  X  1. Here w 1 and w 2 are two windows which the cross-correlation according to Eq.(10) between every two channels is calculated in the time interval that these two windows have overlap; we should use the windowed signals in order to satisfy the stationary criterion. The size of w 1 and w2 should be chosen such that w1 5 w2 5 N and as described in ( Theiler, 1986 ) we can find them through trial and error while some constrains on the misconsidered. When SL n  X  p ref , it means that no synchronization exists between x and y (SL n is equal to the likelihood that random vectors y n and y v are closer than e y ). In contrast, if SL the perfect synchronization and intermediate coupling is reflected by p ref o SL n o 1. Finally, SL is defined as the time average of the SL n values. In the present study, the following parameters were obtained through the cross validation: t  X  20; m  X  10; w 1  X  200 samples; w 2  X  500 samples; p ref  X  0.05 to compute the SL index. 4. Feature selection
In this study, synchronization among all 19 channels are successively obtained and arranged in an upper-triangular matrix. The size of this matrix is 19 18 while only half of its element should be determined. All pair-wise synchronization values do not necessarily carry discriminative information. Therefore, to avoid the redundant ones, the number of features should be decreased by an efficient feature selection method. Since more useful feature selection approaches need discrete data as input, we should discretize the continuous extracted features. Chi-square is one of the most competent procedures ( Liu and Setiono, 1997 ) and then we used it to prepare attributes for the selection phase. Among the state-of-art filter-based feature selec-tion methods, AGV ( Dias et al., 2009 ) is employed as a strong feature selection algorithm. Finally a novel sequential search strategy based on the greedy search, termed as greedy overall-relevancy (GOR), is proposed. GOR is a filter-based approach which uses information gain ratio as its criterion. What follows is the description of AGV and GOR methods. 4.1. Across group variance
Across-group variance (AGV) is a filter-based feature selection method that uses a different form of principal component analysis (PCA) ( Dias et al., 2009 ). In AGV method considering singular value decomposition (SVD), the total covariance ( C ) is decom-posed into both sum of within ( C within ) and between ( C group covariance parts. First all eigenvalues are determined and then normalized. The AGV value of each direction, in the between class scatter, has been used instead of the formal eigenvalues ( l to back project each into the original feature space as described below: C  X  where V i is the i th eigenvector and the AGV i is the distance between the groups given by the i th component, normalized by its total variance as in equation:
AGV  X  where V i T C between V i is a function of the distances between the respective groups X  means. Technically, the variance information provided by a principal component is induced by l
In the discrimination context, only the second term in Eq. (13) comprises useful variance information; as a result, only this term has been used to calculate AGV i . In the Eq. (11), k is a threshold on the number of descending ordered AGV scores to truncate the list of principal components; consequently, the dimension is highly reduced. This truncation criterion is a cumulative sum percentage of the descending ordered AGV scores and was assigned (typically 60% X 90%) for variance truncation ( Jolliffe, 2002 ). After finding the parameter k, by considering 60% of cumulative sum, the k features which resemble the retained components with minimal informa-tion loss, participate to determine C AGV using Eq. (11). Each diagonal value of C AGV represents the variance of a particular feature which is composed by the k retained principal compo-nents and measures feature discriminability. Then, sorting diag-onal values in AGV covariance matrix in descending order gives a ranked list of all features. To find the optimal number of features which should be selected from this ranked list, cross-validation is used.The pseudo-code of AGV algorithm is brought below.
AGV(data) { [U,S,V]  X  SVD(data); eigval  X  diag(S.^2); TotalCovariance  X  covariance(data);

Then, the proposed feature selection algorithm is explained. 4.1.1. Information gain information captured inside that data. Entropy is also a measure of the impurity or irregularity in a collection of instances ( Cover and Thomas, 1991 ) and many criteria are proposed such as mutual information and information gain which use entropy as their core. Information gain is defined to show effectiveness of an attribute to classify an input. For a training data denoted S , the information gain of attribute A is described as Gain  X  S , A  X  X  Entropy  X  S  X  where values ( A ) is the set of all values that assigned to the attribute A , and S i is the set of those instances that their value for attribute A is i (where i is one of the values assigned to the attribute A ) and S i is the number of these instances. in entropy that is expected by considering the attribute A . There-fore, a feature with higher value of information gain is expected to be more convenient for the classification. Nevertheless, using this measurement as the goodness of an attribute has some disad-vantages. The main drawback is the preferable bias that is imposed to the search strategy. This bias makes search algorithm to favor attributes with wide range of values over those with narrow range. Actually, an attribute with broad range of values perfectly classifies the training data while it might not be a useful predictor for unseen data despite its good performance in training examples. To avoid this problem, the information gain of each attribute can be normalized by the entropy which is provided by that attribute. The new alternative measure called Gain Ratio and is defined as ( Cover and Thomas, 1991 ): Gain Ratio S , A  X  X  X  Gain  X  S , A  X  Entropy  X  A  X   X  15  X  of features, a similar measure to gain ratio has been used. We call this yardstick relevancy measure (YRM). In general, the relevancy measure for two random variables X and Y is determined by relevancy  X  X , Y  X  X  GainRatio  X  X , Y  X  Entropy  X  X  X  X  Entropy  X  Y  X  and also between two attributes is used in the following greedy algorithms. 4.1.2. Proposed feature selection algorithm
Both Forward and Backward selection methods ( Liu Huan, 2005 ; Pudil et al., 1994 ) highly suffer from lack of back tracking procedure. In other words, they are unable to revise their selected features after the adding or removing them. To overcome this drawback by considering interaction among the features during the search, a new average measurement is introduced here.
According to this criterion, the performance of features is con-sidered when they are used together; the proposed algorithm tries to find irrelevant features such that by removing them the performance improves compared to the primary state. To achieve this aim, a search strategy has been presented to guide our selection. The goal is that the redundant features, which do not have any new contribution over already selected features, should not be selected. This phase needs to compute pair-wise relevancy between all attributes. As we present a good definition of this relevancy by Eq. (16), this equation is used in this phase.
Most existing algorithms that find pair-wise correlations have time complexity of O ( N 2 )where N is the number of features.
Symmetrical property of relevancy measure in Eq. (16) is conspic-uous. Here, a relevancy matrix is constructed by using this equation.
It needs N ( N 1 ) / 2 elements and is called A rm which is defined as yyyyy
Thesizeofmatrixis (N 1 ) (N 1 ) and rm i,j measures the relevancy between the features i and j using Eq. (16). A normalization method is presented in this study to participate the relevancy measure of feature i with all other attributes along with all relevan-cies of feature j in the element rm i,j (for each i and j  X  1, 2 ,
An informative irrelevant subse t of features can better present a dataset for the classification purpose. Thus, the element with mini-mum relevancy value in A rm indicates the most irrelevant attributes which should be selected as an ind ependent candidate which carries its own information and is added to the subset of selected features.
A simple strategy can find the minimum values in A rm succes-sively; therefore, attributes with minimum pair-wise relevancy are selected. Nevertheless, this pa ir-wise selected subset does not consider the subsets with three or more number of features together; however, it may produce a subset which some of its members might be relevant. For example, if rm i,j and rm k,l minimums in A rm ,itmeansthateither i and j are the most independent ones or k and l ,but i might have high relevancy with k or/andthesamefor l and j . To overcome this difficulty, the overall relevancy is defined and has been used to scale all elements of A such that each element rm i,j can include all dependencies of the i th feature with other attributes and also all dependencies of the j th feature with other attributes. This overall relevancy is obtained from a normalization approach entitled the  X  X  X verall-normalized-rele-vancy (ONR) X  X  which is defined as follows.

Definition 1. The ONR value for each element of matrix A rm overall dependency between attributes f i and f j and obtained by 8 i  X  1 , 2 , ... , N 1 Avg i  X  Average for f i 8 j  X  1 , 2 , ... , N 1 Avg j  X  Average for f j :  X  rm k , j
Based on the above definition, overall dependency of all pairs is determined. Therefore, if a feature has high average relevancy with a large number of other features, its overall dependency would be high and vice versa. In the new matrix which includes overall dependencies, the minimum value declares the lowest relevant features. We assume the minimum betided in index ( i, j ) where i and j are the row and column numbers, respectively. Therefore, attributes i and j are the most independent ones and should be added to the selected list as informative features.
The next attribute should have minimum relevancy with the two selected features. So the algorithm searches among attributes along two lines which are i th row and j th column. The algorithm seeks for minimum relevancy in these two lines. If the minimum is happened in element rm i,k , the relevancy of attributes k and j (which already is selected) should not exceed than a predefined threshold value ( d ). This threshold determines the level of dependency, which is acceptable till this stage of algorithm. In matrix A rm each element rm l,r quantifies the value to which f is correlated to f r . Hence, if we intend the algorithm to find a threshold according to relevancy values of another selected feature ( j here), a quantify estimation will be found about the extent to which f k is not dependent to the rest relevant features in the selected list. The estimated value should be associated with all relevancies of another feature. A good choice will be the average relevancy of the feature j . To give an exact account of what is this concept mean, we define the Relevant-Non-Redun-dant ( R-N-R ( feature as follows: Definition 2. Feature f k is Relevant-non-redundant (R-N-R) con-cerning to features i and j if k  X  argmin  X  rm i , k , rm k , j  X 8 k  X  1 , :::: N 9 rm a a) If k happens in row i, it should be rm i , k r 1 = 9 rm where 9 rm j 9 is the number of element in column j which is not zero. b) If k happens in column j , it should be rm k , j r 1 = where 9 rm i 9 is the number of element in row i which are not zero.

If a feature satisfies the above condition, it calls R X  X  X  X  and should be added to the list of discriminative selected features. Here, a heuristic is proposed that can reveal the relevant features which are not redundant.

Heuristic:
Regarding the above methodology, a new algorithm is devel-oped, named Greedy Overall-Relevancy search (GOR) which is described below. //input data with N features and M instances // C 1 , C 2 , y ., C 3 are class label , SL is selected feature list 1-SL  X   X  2-8 i  X  1 , 2 , ... , N , 8 j  X  i  X  1 , :::: , N 1 y A rm 3-find overall dependency A rm using Eq. 16 5-while (! issatisfied(SL)) { ( m , n )  X  FindNext y (i,j); if ( m , n ) = 2 SF
SL  X  SL  X  m &amp; 9 n ; i  X  m ; j  X  n ;}
The function FindNext ( i,j ) in the above pseudo-code uses the foregoing heuristic to select the next feature. The three essential parts of this algorithm are: (1) Calculation relevancy values between all pairs of features (step 2) (2) Finding the overall dependency between all pairs of attributes by the novel overall-normalization method (step 3) (3) Selecting lower correlated attributes by a two-line process method to decrease the opportunity of choosing the redun-dant attributes (steps 4 X 5).

The algorithm iterates at step 5 till a satisfactory number of attributes has been chosen. In other words, termination criterion is considered as the value of classification accuracy (wrapper approach) which is the main objective of this paper. The first part of the above algorithm has a quadratic time complexity in terms of the number of features N . As it mentioned in the second part, to determine overall dependencies the average value of each row and each column should be calculated and its complexity is O(N
Also the third part of algorithm for selecting the minimum value in all matrix values needs a search of O ( N 2 ) and successively a strategy of O ( N ) to search the two lines of already selected features. 5. Statistical evaluation of feature space
To classify the extracted and then selected features from EEG signals, some conventional classifiers include support vector machine (SVM) ( Vapnic, 1998 ), a modified version of nearest neighbor (MNN) ( Alimardani et al., 2008 ) and boosted version of linear discriminant analysis (BDLDA) ( Lu et al., 2006 ) were implemented and utilized. The reason of employing SVM is that this classifier tries to minimize the expected risk on the test data and consider a margin around the boundary that increases generalization property of this scheme. SVM benefits from a convex optimization formula that makes it robust and optimal.
In addition, in the case of complex feature space, a suitable kernel function can be employed to map the input space into a higher dimensional space which increases the separability of samples into the new space. SVM has this capability to adopt kernel property into its optimization formula and find an optimal solution for the projected data. Nevertheless, SVM is sensitive to the noisy data and also do not able to handle data with multi-modal distribution.

From another angle, BDLDA benefits from positive properties of LDA and boosting framework. LDA finds its boundary by optimizing the Fisher criteria using the within and between class scatter matrices. LDA is not as sensitive to the noisy data as to
SVM one. Moreover, boosting framework can guarantee the generalization property and demonstrate a less difference between the train and test performance. In contrast, BDLDA does not able to consider any margin around its boundary. Incidentally,
BDLDA is not able to handle scattered data with multimodal distribution. In contrast to BDLDA and SVM, the recent proposed
MNN is able to locally take a decision and easily able to handle classes with multimodal distributions. What follows is a brief explanation of MNN which has been introduced in one of our recent work. 5.1. Modified nearest neighbor classifier classifier which is used in many applications such as data mining, information retrieval and classification biomedical signals ( Shakhnarovich et al., 2005 ). The standard NN classifier finds a train pattern that it is the most similar to the test pattern. NN rule is a very intuitive method which its result depends on the similarity measurement that is chosen. Recently, to overcome this dependency a voting scheme based on three distance func-tion has been used ( Alimardani et al., 2008 ). Distance functions that used in voting are: Euclidean, Manhattan and Minkowski distances. The parameter k in the Minkowski distance is selected k  X  6. The flowchart of this method is illustrated in Fig. 1 . 6. Experimental results
EEG synchronization features to BDLDA, SVM, and MNN classifiers are illustrated. Lack of any valid quantitative measure to help accurate diagnosis between Schizophrenia and BMD disorders motivated us to extract informative features from EEG signals of patients from each group and classify these features as an EEG-based automatic diagnostic tool.
 recorded from the patients using 10 X 20 international standard recording system and trials contaminated by artifacts were eliminated by visual inspection and time regression method ( He et al., 2007 ) as described in Section 2 . In the preprocessing stage, EEG signals were filtered using a fourth degree zero-phase
Butterworth filter and then their synchronization values mea-sured by the mentioned methods. In order to design a real-time processing system, EEGs were segmented into statistically sta-tionary intervals by windowing with 50% overlap. Results of applying stationary-test showed that window length should be maximum 440 samples empirically such that the segmented signals were remained stationary.
 Afterward, informative synchronization features including RS,
PLV and SL were extracted by averaging along windowed signal for each pair of channels. Indeed for each patient a matrix is calculated in which each row of this matrix reveals synchroniza-tion value of each channel with others. The order of channels is considered as: FP2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T3, T4, T5, T6, Fz, Cz, Pz, and FP1.

To avoid frequent determination of RS, PLV and SL synchroni-zation values, we propose a simple sequential algorithm which is described as follows. For the first channel (according to the mentioned order), synchronization values is determined with all other channels but for the second channel, synchronization for further channels (expect the first channel) is determined; conse-quently, to calculate the synchronization of each channel, regard-ing its order in the queue, synchronization with the next channels is determined. Hence, if we arrange the achieved synchronization values for all channels in a matrix, the resulted matrix would be upper-triangular. The synchronization matrix for each participant based on RS synchronization index is schematically depicted below yyyyyy FP1 0 yyy RS 19,18  X  0
As we see this matrix has: 18  X  17  X  16  X  y  X  1  X  (19 18)/ 2  X  171, probable non-zero values. Thus, the feature vector which is calculated for each patient has 171 values obtained by pair-wise synchronizations and the feature set for all participants together is a matrix of size 53 171. It is obvious that without an efficient feature selecting phase, the accuracy rate of classifiers will be less than applying the classifiers to the selected subset of features due to the estimating less number of parameters. The results of applying the aforementioned classifiers to the full feature set are reported in Tables 3 X 5 (in the 3th column).
The best accuracy (88.68%) is obtained by applying PLV features to SVM classifier. Execution of T-test on the extracted features of the two classes provided p -value  X  0.0421 in average that confirmed the significance of the synchronization features.
In the next phase, to reduce the input dimension and remove non-discriminative features, attribute selection techniques include AGV and the proposed GOR algorithms were implemen-ted. This step selects more informative features and consequently improves the classification accuracy between BMD and schizo-phrenia classes. The synchronized channels for all subjects that were selected by GOR feature selection method were listed in
Table 2 . It means that for each patient instead of considering a feature vector with 171 values, GOR and AGV select just dis-criminative pair-wise synchronization values. For example some of synchronization pair-wise values for each participant based on
RS measurement is selected by GOR algorithm and are marked by  X  X  *  X  X  X nd those which are not selected indicated by  X  X   X   X  X  in the following matrix.

In fact, by using an efficient strategy to selecting some discriminative pairs for example for RS features, the number of pair-wise synchronization which should be considered is reduced to: 9 values for the FP2 channel  X  7 values for F3 channel  X  and finally 3 values for T6. Therefore, in total 78 values are selected using GOR algorithm on RS features which is significantly decreased the dimension compare to the primary number of features (171).

In the classification phase, MNN, BDLDA classifier and SVM were selected to assess the extracted synchronization features with and without the feature selection phase. To determine the accuracy diagnosis between the two groups, leave-one-out cross validation is used that in each fold, all pair-wise features of a patient is considered as the test set and the train set is con-structed by the remained features belonged to other patients. Classification accuracy achieved by applying the mentioned classifiers to the selected features is brought in Tables 3 X 5 respectively. As we see, applying classification to the original feature space has less accuracy while diagnosis rate is drastically improved up to 92.45% by GOR with SVM and 91.34% using AGV with SVM. Actually without selection, the graph of interconnec-tion among channels is a full graph, while by removing the non-informative ones this graph will be reduced as exhibited in Fig. 2 . 7. Discussion and conclusion
In the current research, patients are audial or visually stimu-lated and then their EEG signals in response to that stimulus were processed while in our approach we process the natural EEG in absent of any stimulus or mental task. The patients were asked to be relaxed and close their eyes during the EEG signal recording.
As mentioned in previous sections, the aim of this research is to classify the BMD and schizophrenic patients according to their
EEG synchronization measurements. Several synchronization indexes were proposed ( Arnhold et al., 1999 ; Quiroga et al., 2002 ; Stam and van Dijk, 2002 ; Mormann et al., 2000 ; Lachaux et al., 1999; Hramov and Koronovskii, 2005 ) to determine the synchronization of EEG signals that among them SL, RS, and PLV were chosen due to their capability in revealing linear and non-linear synchronization among different EEG channels. In addition, FP2 *****  X  X  **  X  X  X  X  *  X  X  *  X  F3 0  X  *  X  X  ***  X  *  X  *  X  X  X  *  X  X

Filter-based schemes usually employ distance-based, similarity-based, information-based (like mutual information or information gain) or correlation-based criter ia. In this study, across-group variance and the proposed greedy-overall relevancy (GOR) methods (which use covariance-based and information-based criteria, respec-tively), were used to select more informative features. work consisting: feature extraction, feature selection and classi-fication phases, we can discriminate BMD and schizophrenic patients with a very high accuracy. The achieved results exhibited that there is a significant synchronization difference between these two types of mental illnesses. The reason of employing synchronization methods for diagnosis in this study is that the brain signals of BMD patients are more active than schizophrenic ones. This is therefore BMD patients whether in the manic phase (patients do high physical activities) or in the depression phase (patients continuously think about negative things and somehow do a mental task) have a higher mental activity rather than schizophrenic patients. Even in previous approaches, it shows that schizophrenic patients tend to be more repetitive and their brain signals are not complex ( Sabeti et al., 2007 ). Several research findings confirmed that fractal dimension of EEG signals in schizophrenic patients is lower than that of normal subjects.
Therefore it is expected that active brains contains more coactive areas rather lazy brains ( Sabeti et al., 2007 ; Sabeti et al., 2009 ). be meaningful not for example summation of these values in the form of one dimensional feature. Moreover, discovering the co-activated areas do not carry enough discriminative information, while the accurate degree of this co-activation (achieved by feature selection) among all channels is informative. As you see, we did not incorporate the information of co-activated locations for the classi-fication task. That is why previous research could not lead to such achievement because considering a total index (like Z-Score ( Knott et al., 2002 )) or just discovering the synchronous areas is not quite informative.

Results in Tables 3 X 5 indicated PLV index that only consider the phase information were more discriminative than SL and RS indexes which were determined in the state space domain. This achievement arises from this fact that BMD patients experience manic episodes in which their neuronal activities are increased leading to reveal more asynchronous co-activations among the channels while schizophrenic patients do not experience such a hyperactive phase. Therefore, PLV can measure this asynchronous (anarchy) behavior among the channels better than SL and RS methods due to this fact that although EEG signals behave chaotically, but co-activation of channels do not show such chaotic behavior.

Thus, all information among the channels lays on their co-activation phase and the signal channels do not behave indepen-dently. Incidentally, this co-activation phase is significantly dif-ferent among patients with BMD from those with schizophrenia.
Hence, we can come to this conclusion that hidden neuronal connections among different brain parts of BMD and schizophre-nic patients are different because EEG signal of each channel is the spatio-temporal integration of neurons X  activity which reflected at that point; consequently, different co-activation phases among different channels between the two groups arises from significant difference in the neural connections of their brain structure.

As an evident observation, X-ray images recorded by compu-terized tomography (CT)apparatus showed wider brain sinusoidal cavities in schizophrenic patients compare to control subjects while no deformity between the brains of BMD patients with controls was found ( Sadock and Sadock, 2005 ).

In spite of all efforts for artifact removing from EEGs, there are still some noisy and outliers samples in the filtered EEG signals.
These noisy samples affect the extracted features and make them noisy. SVM and BDLDA as global classifier are less sensitive to these outlier samples rather than MNN. On the other side, SVM decision is more robust and reliable than the other linear decision making method like LDA but boosting framework enable BDLDA classifier to produce a piecewise linear decision boundary. Besides SVM by involving only the support vectors makes a sparse solution and eliminates the effect of less-important samples in decision boundary while BDLDA considers all samples in its weak learners with different distributions. Hence, due to the convex equation of SVM and its strong statistical background based on minimization of risk expectation and also ability of kernel func-tion to map the input data into a more discriminative space (in higher dimensional space), SVM outperformed MNN and BDLDA classifiers.
 As we see in Tables 3 X 5 the features which are selected by GOR algorithm result more accuracy than those which are selected by AGV. This superiority arises from this point that GOR algorithm has more efficient and comprehensive search algorithm than AGV. Moreover, its criterion is an information-based one that carries more information compare to covariance-based criteria. It has been proven that selecting more useful and discriminative features not only reduce complexity of classifica-tion problems but also by eliminating non-informative attributes remove the impact of these features in classifier decision; conse-quently, the classifier decision for unseen data can be more confident.

Greedy search is one of the simple and fast approaches to select an informative subset with less relevant features. Almost greedy approaches consider attribute individually in their search strategies. In this paper, to solve this limitation of greedy searches, a novel overall dependency has been defined and a new search strategy is introduced. Defining ONR values incorpo-rate the information of all other pair-wised relevancies for each pair-wise relevancy between features which is a good measure to normalize relevancies. Obviously, when considering the effect of cooperation between all features together, the generalization of the selected subset is improved. Experimental results showed the supremacy of the proposed algorithm compare to the other strategies.

It should be noted that no research has found directly for classification of BMD from schizophrenic patients based on their EEG synchronization; nevertheless, some efforts based on EEG synchronization have been made to distinguish BMD from control subjects and schizophrenic subjects from controls separately. In this way, spearman correlation coefficients (ranged from 0.5 to 0.6) among the phase synchronization indices (PSI) and positive symptoms (PS), negative symptoms and general psychopathology (GP) in schizophrenic patients have been measured to investigate the relationship between the level of phase synchronization and remarked symptoms ( Bob et al., 2008 ). In their research, 31 schizophrenic patients were participated and their EEG signals were recorded in closed eyes condition from 8 channels (F3, F4, T3, T4, C3, C4, P3, P4) and the PSI of 28 pairs of channels was determined.

The PSI measurement which is used in ( Bob et al., 2008 )is similar to PLV value which is used in our study. Therefore, their research can be compared with our study in which the synchro-nization method used in both studies are similar but GOR method select the most relevant pairs of channels while it eliminate the redundant and less informative PLV values. The comparison results with and without the feature selection confirm the supremacy of our approach.

In another study Gamma coherence in response to visual oddball paradigm in ten medication-free, manic patients was studied before and after six weeks of drug therapy in comparison with ten control subjects ( Ays -eg  X  ul et al., 2010 ). The electrode pairs which were considered in ( Ays -eg  X  ul et al., 2010 ) covered the inter-hemispheric (contains electrodes F3 X  X 4, C3 X  X 4, T3 X  X 4, T5 X  T6, P3 X  X 4, O1 X  X 2) and intra-hemispheric (contains electrodes
F3 X  X 3, F4 X  X 4, F3 X  X 5, F4 X  X 6, F3 X  X 1, F4 X  X 2, C3 X  X 1, C2 X  X 4) regions. It has been shown that pretreatment coherence values in response to both target and non-target stimuli at the right fronto-temporal location has significantly lower value in compar-ison to normal subjects. Briefly, this article showed that magni-tude-squared coherence (MSC) is an informative synchronization feature to diagnose BMD from normal subjects. Therefore, to compare their method with the proposed one in this study, gamma coherence feature is implemented and tested on our data and compared to RS, PLV and SL features in terms of accuracy.
Table 6 shows the results of applying the proposed framework using MSC features with the PLV features. As we can see, the accuracy of MSC feature is not comparable with PLV one or other used synchronization indexes.

In conclusion, the achieved results support the effectiveness of selected PLV values along with SVM classifier to differentiate BMD from schizophrenic patients with a confident accuracy.
To the best of authors X  knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize the selected synchronization indexes as informative features applying to a classifier for diagnosing the psychiatric patients. References
