 In this introductory tutorial we give an overview of click models for web search. We show how the framework of probabilistic graphical models help to explain user behavior, build new evaluation metrics and perform simulations. The tutorial is augmented with a live demo where participants have a chance to implement a click model and to test it on a publicly available dataset.
 H.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval Click models; web search
Click models, probabilistic models of the behavior of search engine users, have been studied extensively by the information retrieval community during the last five years.

A good body of work has been published on click models over the past 5 to 10 years. Importantly, the area continues to be an active one, with new models aimed at describing and/or predicting behavioral data being proposed at each of the main information retrieval conferences (SIGIR, WSDM, WWW, CIKM) over the past few years. There is also a fair number of publications that use click models presented in the main information retrieval conferences as well as ACM journals such as TOIS. All this indicates that there is a substantial and continued level of interest in the topic.
Indeed, we now have a handful of basic click models, inference methods, evaluation principles and applications for click models, that form the building blocks of ongoing research efforts in the area. The time is right to organize and present this material to a broad audience of interested information retrieval researchers, whether junior or senior. Many of the click models available today have been proposed by different industrial and academic research groups X  X ne of the key aims of our proposed tutorial is to bring these together and offer a unified perspective. To achieve this, we describe the should be familiar with the basic definitions and intuitions of what we consider to be the core models, with inference tasks for these models, and with uses of these models. While our presentation is necessarily formal in places, we make a serious effort to relate the models, the inference procedures and the applications back to the core information retrieval task and to web search data by including a fair number of examples. We hope that this supplies attendees who are new to the area with effective means to start using click models in their own research. This introductory tutorial consists of two blocks of 1.5 hours. Each block will incorporate three types of activity: (1) presentation of the material, (2) live coding sessions, and (3) discussions at the end of the block. For the coding sessions, we will provide code examples and data samples. The participants will be able to either follow the examples on the slides or perform them live along with the presentation. During the discussion sessions at the end of each the 1.5 hour blocks, we will offer the participants a number of quizzes aimed to (self-)assess the comprehension of the presented material. The schedule of the introductory tutorial is as follows. 1. Introduction and Historical Notes 2. Aims of this Tutorial 3. Basic Click Models 4.
