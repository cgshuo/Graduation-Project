 Time plays an important role regarding user preferences for products. It introduces asymmetries into the adoption of products which should be considered in the context of rec-ommender systems and business intelligence. We therefore investigate how temporally asymmetric user preferences can be analyzed using a latent factor model called Decompo-sition Into Directional Components (DEDICOM). We in-troduce a new scalable hybrid algorithm that combines pro-jected gradient descent and alternating least squares updates to compute DEDICOM and imposes semi-nonnegativity con-straints to better interpret the resulting factors. We apply our model to analyze user churn and migration between dif-ferent computer games in a social gaming environment.

Recommender systems play two crucial roles in the mod-ern information age. On the one hand, they aid users in deci-sion making when confronted with massive amounts of data. On the other hand, they allow companies to capitalize on the purchasing patterns of users. Especially w.r.t. the latter, it is important to understand migration patterns between products. Traditional recommender systems, however, fo-cus on the former and try to establish similarities between items based on explicit or implicit user feedback. Latent factor models [9] extend this notion by studying similari-ties between users and items. Such similarities are defined trough latent factors resulting from a factorization of, say, a rating matrix in which user preference for different items are encoded. Contrary to this, we here consider a latent Figure 1: A pictorial representation of Two Way DEDICOM partitioning. Asymmetrical relationships in S  X  R n  X  n are decomposed into a latent factor matrix A  X  R n  X  k and an asymmetric mode transition matrix R  X  R k  X  k . factor model that attempts to reveal latent migration pat-terns between products. This requires us to consider asym-metric matrices encoding ownership histories or movements between different items.

Our contribution relies on the decomposition into direc-tional components (DEDICOM) model due to Harshman [6] who introduced it to analyze asymmetric relationships in social connections. We propose a new scalable hybrid al-gorithm composed of projected gradient descent and alter-nating least squares methods for DEDICOM partitioning. Our approach is easy to implement and computationally less intensive than previously proposed algorithms. More-over, while traditional DEDICOM may produce negative mode transitions which might be difficult to interpret, our approach forces them to be nonnegative. In doing so, latent migrations habits are expressed in terms of proportions. We illustrate the use of our approach in the context of analyzing churn migration of players of computer games.
Matrix and tensor factorization techniques have become popular tools to analyze large and complex data sets for they can reveal hidden structures and provide interpretable and actionable results [1,4,9]. Often, data matrices are asymmet-ric, for instance if they express relationships between mem-bers of a community, movements between places, or item-to-item relationships [1, 2, 6, 8]. In this paper, we are thus concerned with DEDICOM which is a latent factor model for asymmetric matrices. DEDICOM and its variants have been used in variety of contexts including network analysis, game data mining, natural language processing, and infor-mation retrieval [1, 2, 4, 7]. Given a matrix S  X  R n  X  n expresses asymmetric relations between n objects and an integer k n , DEDICOM attempts to factorize S as where A  X  R n  X  k and R  X  R k  X  k . Fig. 1 illustrates this idea. The columns a : j of matrix A are understood to rep-resent latent factors causing the structures represented in S and the relations between these factors are encoded by the asymmetric affinity matrix R . DEDICOM thus approx-imates individual relationships in s ij as where a i : and a j : represent the i th and j th row of A , re-spectively, and r b : represents the b th row of R .
Computing DEDICOM can be cast as a matrix norm min-imization problem where the objective is to minimize the following loss function with respect to A and R
A variety of constrained and unconstrained methods have been proposed to solve (3) [1, 2, 7]. In this work we intro-duce a hybrid algorithm composed of projected gradient de-scent and alternating least squares methods for Orthogonal DEDICOM. Our algorithm updates A using projected gra-dient descent and thereafter it updates R in an alternating least squares fashion. The main difference of our approach to previous solutions [1, 2, 7] is in the update for A . Unlike in [1,2], our method takes each occurrence of A into account when minimizing (3) w.r.t. A . Compared to previously in-troduced methods it provides a computationally efficient ap-proach including a reduced number of factor parameters for the updates which makes the update step straightforward to implement. Furthermore, we propose a new way of in-terpreting DEDICOM factorizations in an additive fashion which is realized through constraining R to be nonnegative. In this section, we derive our Hybrid Orthogonal (HO) DEDICOM model and present two algorithms to find such a decomposition. Starting with the derivation of the update step for A , we write (3) in terms of matrix traces to have E ( A ) = tr h S T S  X  2 S T ARA T + AR T A T ARA T i . (4) Since traces are linear mappings and the term S T S does not depend on A , minimizing E in (4) is equivalent to min-imizing E 0 which is defined as The solution can be now simplified if we introduce an orthog-onality constraint. Since traces are invariant under cyclic permutations, we cast (5) as Restricting the columns of A to be orthogonal unit vectors in R n yields the equality A T A = I k . This simplifies (6) to Considering the gradient of E 0 with respect to A , we have Algorithm 1 Hybrid Orthogonal DEDICOM
Randomly initialize A and R while Stopping condition is not satisfied do end while
Using the gradient in (9) we can define an update for A that adapts the current solution as follows where  X  A is a learning rate that might be static or dynami-cally adapted using inexact line search methods or annealing techniques. Similar to [2], as the update might lead to solu-tions that are not orthogonal, we enforce orthogonality using the QR -Decomposition A = QU where Q is orthogonal and U is upper triangular and set A = Q .

Fixing A , the problem of minimization (3) becomes a ma-trix regression problem w.r.t. R . That is, as A has full rank and k &lt; n , we multiply both sides of S by the left-and right generalized inverses. Owing to the orthogonality of A we have and Accordingly, an alternating least square update for R can be defined as The essential steps of this procedure are summarized in Algorithm 1. Compared to the existing approaches our method is straightforward to implement and does not re-quire computationally expensive operations such as matrix inversion in the update step.
Revisiting (2), we can interpret DEDICOM as a soft clus-tering method that accounts for asymmetric similarities be-tween loadings , i.e. entries in A . In this case, the relation between two objects will be determined as a weighted com-bination of the global relations between clusters that are scaled by the latent factors. This interpretation might be misleading when the global relations between clusters that are encoded in R are negative. This leaves us with a sit-uation where we can only interpret entries where each of the factors in a ib r bc a jc is positive. To address this issue, we impose nonnegativity constraints on the affinity matrix R . The advantages of having nonnegative affinities in DEDI-COM consist in an interpretability of both the affinity ma-trix R as a compressed version of the data matrix S and Figure 2: Average reconstruction error for missing link esti-mation through cross-validation. the estimation in (2). In other words, when R contains only nonnegative values, they will scale the additive cluster-ranking assigned through the loadings. For instance, given two entities i and j and a nonnegative matrix R , when ap-proximating the similarity from i to j : the loadings with the same sign will have an additive effect whereas the loadings with opposite signs will have a subtractive effect.
Keeping the above alternating least squares approach, a nonnegative R can be found by making sure that its values are nonnegative and do not increase the error defined in (3). Formally, in each iteration, we are thus required to solve for R with a nonnegativity constraint E 00 ( R ) = S  X  ARA T 2  X  r ij  X  0  X  i,j  X  [1 ,...,k ] . (14) The error in (14) remains the same if we vectorize the ma-trices as where vec vectorizes (flattens) a matrix C  X  R n  X  m as follows Considering our special case of ARA T , we can write where  X  denotes the Kronecker product. Substituting (17) in (15) we obtain We can then reformulate (14) as where y = vec( S ), B = A  X  A and x = vec( R ). With the latest derivation in (19), we have reformulated the problem of obtaining semi-nonnegative affinities in DEDICOM as a nonnegative least-squares problem [10] for which fast meth-ods are available [3]. Therefore, keeping the updates of ma-trix A as in Alg. 1 and finding R by solving (19) provides us with an optimal Semi-Nonnegative (SNN) DEDICOM par-titioning.
Churn and retention analysis in virtual environments con-sists of analyzing factors affecting the dynamics of global user preferences [5, 11]. As a use case, we consider an appli-cation of semi-nonnegative DEDICOM to analyze the churn migration behavior among computer game players. Churn analysis has been previously studied in the context of game behavior analysis in [5,11] where a player is considered to be churning when there is no player activity present in a par-ticular time window. Generalizing this notion to multiple games, we define that a migration occurs between any two different games i and j from time t to t + 1 when a player quits playing game i that they played at t and starts playing game j at t + 1. In the study presented here, we analyze migration between games in a data set of two consecutive snapshots each covering two months of game activity logs in 2014. That is, our data set contains information as to whether players played a game or not. In total our data shows the game-play activities of 79,695 individual players on a social gaming platform with 2,257 games. We define a churn migration matrix as described above by accumulat-ing the frequencies of migrations for each player, between the snapshots. We compare the generalization capabilities of Hybrid Orthogonal DEDICOM with and without semi-nonnegativity constraint to pure -SVD due to the latter X  X  popularity in research and industry. Our results indicate outcomes after 5-fold block-based cross validation.
In Fig. 2 we show how the rate of residual sum of squares (RSS) [4] which can be defined as changes for different numbers of latent factors determined by the algorithms. Within the given settings, we observed that semi-nonnegative DEDICOM yields the lowest average error rate and obtained a value of 53% for the unseen game migration entries with three latent factor partitioning.
Analyzing the semi-nonnegative partitioning with three latent factors, we obtain different characteristics describing the migration behavior among the analyzed players (summa-rized in Fig. 3a). The first behavioral group represents the migration among highly rated games (a.k.a. AAA games) and the largest interactions that occur in this group show that the majority of users actually prefers to stay within this group of games. The second group, which we labeled F2P-Indie , represents player interactions between Free-to-play (F2P) games and so called indie games (released by in-dependent developers) in comparison to the AAA -group and the Platformer -group; here we do not observe any self tran-sitions. The third group, i.e. the Platformer -group, repre-sents player activity within a genre of games called two-and two-and-a-half-dimensional or oblique rotated games ; here we observe only a strong self affinity which indicates that players of this genre like to stay within the genre. Addition-ally, we use distributions of user generated game tags that describe the content, difficulty and the genres of games to have more insight about the types of games contributing to the groups. Since the games we are analyzing mostly contain more than one tag, in Fig. 3b, we compare loading-weighted user generated game tag distributions for each cluster as de-fined by the columns of A where we observe a clear distinc-tion among game genres. Furthermore, comparing the high negative loadings for each cluster we observe no negative loadings for the AAA group specifically whereas the famous games that belong to this group do show rather high negative values in the F2P-Indie -group indicating a weak relationship between games within these two groups. Similarly the high negative loadings for the Platformer -group are distributed Figure 4: Low dimensional embeddings of games with high loadings. We observe a clear separation among the groups of games with different genres. among games that have the highest loadings for the other groups. Moreover similar to other latent factor models, we can study the low dimensional embeddings of games with high loadings in Fig. 4 where we observe a clear separation between the group of games with different genres.
Asymmetric similarity-based latent factor models reveal actionable user preferences and provide descriptive explana-tions as to complex item-related user activities over time. In this paper, we have shown how a semi-nonnegativity con-strained DEDICOM model can reduce the dimensionality of asymmetric data matrices and reveal hidden structure in an interpretable manner to help build advanced analytics systems. The presented use case of analyzing churn migra-tion behavior of the users of a social gaming environment is of considerable practical interest for the gaming industry which is currently adopting their business models towards freemium games in which players pay for game content. In this business environment player churn must be avoided at all cost and a better understanding of player migration be-tween games helps developers improve their designs. Our fu-ture work involves incorporating DEDICOM models to user-and item-based recommender systems, as well as, analyzing different forms of item-to-item relations. [1] B. Bader, R. Harshman, and T.
