 Text, speech, images, video, DNA sequences provide information about entities that people can recognize when looking at a particular instance. But those entities and their attributes and relationships are not directly ac cessible to queries that join across types of sources. Information extraction methods based on supervised machin e learning recognize mentions of entities and relationships of predefined types in different kind s of sources, which can then be used to answer some useful types of queries. Ho wever, supervised learning relies on hand-annotated training sets applications. These limitations have prompted research into unsupervise d extraction methods that rely on correlations among sources rather than hand-annotated training sets. While these methods are not yet as accurate as thos e based on supervised learning, they have the potential for a new query-by-example approach to information integra tion in which seed sets of query answers are expanded into ranked lists of potential answers by learning occurrence patterns from the seed answers. I will give examples of both types of methods from our research on biomedical information extraction, leading to some ideas on a possible convergence of search and databases through machine learning. Keywords: Information and Knowledge Management Fernando Pereira is the Andrew and Debra Rachle ff Professor and chair of the department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania. He received a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in 1982. Before joining Penn, he held industrial research and management positions at SRI International, at AT&amp;T Labs, where he led the machine learning and information retrieval research depa rtment from September 1995 to April 2000, and at WhizBang Labs, a Web information extraction company. His main research interests are in machine-learnable models of language and other natural se quential data such as biological sequences. He made major contributions to advances in finite-state models for speech and text processing now in everyday industrial use. He has over 100 research publications on computational linguistics, speech recognition, machine learning and logic programming, and several issued and pending patents on speech recognition, language pr ocessing, and human-computer interfaces. He was elected Fellow of th e American Association for Artificial Intelligence in 1991 for his contributions to computational lin guistics and logic programmi ng, and he is a past president of the Association for Computational Linguistics.
