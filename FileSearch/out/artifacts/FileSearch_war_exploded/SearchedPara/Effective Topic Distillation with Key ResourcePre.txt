 Currently, Web Information Retrieval (IR) presents a technical challenge due to the size exploding of web document collection, which contains over 20 billion pages as of February, 2003[1]. The number of pages indexed by web search en-gines is increasing at a high speed, for example, Google indexed over 3.3 billion pages in September, 2003, which is about 7 times as many as what it indexed in the year of 2000[2]. How to achieve better performance with fewer pages indexed is becoming more and more interesting in web IR research. Many web search engines have adopted some techniques to identify the quality of web pages inde-pendent of a given user request, in order that they can index more high quality pages with limited resources. But these approaches such as PageRank[3] only use link structures of the web and a better estimate should require additional non-content sources of information both within a page and across different pages. key resources) for a particular topic. These pages can offer users with credible information or a good entry point to several useful pages. About 78% search engine queries are related to this task according to query log analysis of Broder [4]. If key resources can be pre-selected from the whole collection, a large number of web search requests can be satisfied by indexing these pages only (because only these pages may be returned as results in topic distillation). It is possible to find several non-content features to determine whether one web page is a key resource page or not. In fact, previous TREC experiments[5][6][7] show that some non-content sources of information such as URL and link structure enhance retrieval effectiveness. Which non-content features are useful in selecting key resources and how to use them are the key components of our work.
 a brief review of related works in non-content features of web pages. Section 3 compares differences between key resource pages and ordinary pages in these features. A decision tree-based key resource pre-selection algorithm is demon-strated in section 4. Section 5 describes experiment results of both key resource pre-selection and related content retrieval process. Finally come discussion and conclusion. Non-content features are sources of non-content information both within a page and across different pages, such as URLs and links. Existing studies on web page non-content features are mostly related to site finding. A site finding task is one where the user wants to find a particular site and his query names the site. It belongs to navigational search whose percentage in web search queries is over 20% according to Broder[4].
 in web site finding and several of them have proved effective. Westerveld et al. defined a web page X  X  URL-type according to its URL length and number of dashes ( X / X ). They computed the probability of a page being an entry page given the type of its URL: root, subroot, path, or file. Combination of this feature and some content features helps them to obtain the best result in TREC 2001 X  X  home page finding task[8]. His colleague Kraaij et al. further proved the effectiveness of document length and in-degree in selection of home pages in 2002[9]. Craswell et al. also found that, in optimal conditions, all of the query-independent methods they studied (in-degree, URL-type, and two variants of PageRank) offered a better than random improvement on a content only baseline in site finding[10]. certain topic. It means that key resource page is different from ordinary entry page, although it is defined as entry of one key resource site according to TREC 12 web track X  X  guideline[6]. It means that effective non-content features in site finding should be re-studied in topic distillation and new features should be introduced to separate key resource pages from ordinary pages.
 This section compares differences between ordinary and key resource pages in some non-content features. The features to be discussed are in-link count (in-degree), document length, URL-type, in-site out-link number and in-site out-link anchor rate; features involving self-link analysis of the site are designed specially for key resource separation. Key resource training set used here is composed of relevant qrels of TREC 2002 X  X  topic distillation task (See Section 5). we proposed involving in-site out-link analysis. 3.1 Study of Common-Used Non-content Features In-Link Count (In-Degree). Analysis of both .GOV and key resource train-ing set shows that entry pages are different from ordinary pages in the distribu-tion of in-degree. links than ordinary pages. The plots show that 51.03% key resource pages have more than 10 in-links; while only 9.45% ordinary pages have in-degree over 10. Key resources are high quality pages which interests many web users so a large number of web sites create hyper-links to them for convenience of these users. URL-Type. URL-type proves to be stable and effective in site finding task according to previous TREC experiments [10][14][15]. We followed Kraaij et al. and classified URLs (after stripping off a trailing index.html, if present) into four categories: ROOT, SUBROOT, PATH and FILE. Our experiment gives the following statistics from .GOV and the training set.
 which contains 11.10% pages of .GOV corpus according to Fig. 2. It means that key resource pages are likely to be  X  X on-FILE X  type. Key resource pages have URLs ending with  X / X  or  X  X ndex.html X  because their authors usually use them as index pages for web sites.
 type. In fact about half of them are FILEs. NIH marijuana site entry page can be taken for example: It is a key resource for topic  X  X arijuana X , but its URL www.nida.nih.gov/drugpages/marijuana.html is obviously  X  X ILE X  type.
 Document Length. Average document length (also referred to as page length) of key resource pages is 9008.02 words; it is quietly close to that of the .GOV pages (8644.62 words). compared in Fig. 3. The figure shows that two page sets have similar distribution of page length, except that key resource page length would not be too short. Only 1.12% of key resource pages are shorter than 1000 words. While in ordinary pages, the percent is 16.00%. It means that pages with too few words cannot be key resource pages. This feature can be applied to reduce redundancy in the key resource page set.
 3.2 New Features Involving In-Site Out-Link Analysis In-site out-links of a certain Page A are links from A to other pages in the site where A is located. For example, the hyperlink from AIRS 2004 homepage to AIRS 2004 call for paper page is an in-site out-link of the former page. The link is located in the former page and is at the same time an in-link for the latter one.
 In-Site Out-Link Number. Key resource pages have the function of linking to other informative pages of the same site. The function is like entry page X  X   X  X avigation function X  described in Craswell et al [11]. Key resources need more in-site out-links to finish the navigation function according to the statistics in Fig 4. Average in-site out-link number of key resource set is more than 37 com-pared with that of less than 18 in ordinary page set. connect directly to these informative pages in its site/sub-site. Further analysis in Section 4 shows that this attribute doesn X  X  work as effective as in-degree and URL-type in pre-selection process, however, it helps separate key resource pages where traditional features fail.
 In-Site Out-Link Anchor Rate. Key resource pages X  in-site out-link anchors can be regarded as a brief review of the other pages X  content in the same site. For a certain page A, in-site out-link anchors are anchors describing links from A to other pages in the same site/sub-site as A. In-site out-link anchors are located on A; that is quite different from in-link anchors which are frequently used in content analysis.
 rate. It can be explained by the fact that key resource pages are always index pages for a site/sub-site. They are representatives of sites and in-site out-link anchors work as a summary of these sites X  other pages. So one key resource page should have lots of in-site out-link anchors to introduce its site and its in-site out-link anchor rate is reasonably high.
 There are less than 24% pages in .GOV with in-site out-link anchor rate over 0.1; the percentage is about 61% in key resource training set. Decision tree learning is adopted to combine non-content features discussed in Section 3. It is a method for approximating discrete-valued functions that is robust of noisy data and capable of learning disjunctive expressions. We choose decision tree because it is usually the most effective and efficient classifier when we have a small number of features; it also provides us with a metric to estimate feature quality in the form of information gain (ID3) or information ratio (C4.5). construct the decision tree. This algorithm uses information gain to decide which attribute should be selected as the decision one for the root node of the decision tree. Information gain is a statistical property that measures how well a given attribute separates the training examples according to their target classification. tures with continuous values should be discretized in advance. Attributes range should be partitioned into two or several intervals using a single or a set of cut points (thresholds). One fixed threshold is chosen in our method and after discretization process each non-content feature has boolean values.
 mation gain should be chosen at the root node (cf. Table 1). Then the process of selecting a new attribute and partitioning the training examples is repeated for each non-terminal descendant node, with only the examples associated with the node.
 mation gains while choosing the root node, as shown in Table 1.
 ordinary pages and their information gains are almost the same. Information gain of document length is quite low, but according to Section 3.3 it can be used to keep out redundancy.
 decision tree learning. Sub tree with these two features is used to select key resources from the pages whose URL type are FILE and in-degree are less than 10. The percentage of such kind of pages in .GOV is 68.53%, and there are 29.38% of key resource pages among them. Without in-site out-link analysis, it is impossible to get these key resource pages separated.
 attribute value or all attributes have been tested, the construction process ends. Finally the decision tree shown in Fig. 6 is constructed. With this decision tree, any page in .GOV page set can be judged whether it belongs to the key resource set or not. There are two methods to evaluate the effectiveness of key resource pre-selection. First is the direct evaluation: if the result set selected by the decision tree cov-ers a large number of key resources with a small set size, pre-selection can be regarded as a success. Second, topic distillation on the result set should get high performance although the set size is smaller than the whole page set: It is called indirect way of evaluation. Both direct and indirect evaluations are involved in our experiments. 5.1 Training Set and Test Set The key resource page training set is based on relevant qrels given by TREC 2002 X  X  topic distillation task. The task is to find key resource pages for certain topics but there may be several high-quality pages from one single web site. According to a better key resource definition in TREC 2003, we use entry page to represent all pages in this kind of high-quality site/sub-site.
 is http://ori.dhhs.gov/html/misconduct/casesummaries.asp is used to replace all qrels from the same sub-site for the topic  X  X cientific research misconduct cases X  (Topic No. 559). Because it is the entry page of the site and it has in-site out-links to the following relevant qrels: pages as possible. The task X  X  50 queries are from log analysis of web search engines and NIST gets credible qrels with pooling technology. The topics and relevant qrels are directly used as the test set. 5.2 Key Resource Coverage of the Result Set When fixed threshold values vary in the discretization process described in Sec-tion 4, result sets with different size and key resource coverage are built corre-spondingly. Statistics of several result sets are shown in Fig. 7, from which two important conclusions can be drawn: 1. With the decision tree constructed in Section 4, it is possible to cover about 2. Key resource coverage increases with the key resource set amount. It is ob-5.3 Topic Distillation on the Key Resource Set Experiments in this Section are based on a key resource set with 24.89% pages in .GOV and 73.12% key resources (Set 4 in Fig. 7). BM2500 weighting and default parameter tuning described in[14] are performed in all experiments. Topics and relevant qrels in TREC 2003 topic distillation task are used for testing. In-link anchor retrieval is evaluated together with full text retrieval both on .GOV corpus and on the key resource set, because in-link anchor proves to be an effective source for topic distillation in [6]. These results are also compared with TREC 2003 best run to validate effectiveness of our method in Fig. 8. (46% improvement in R-precision and 42% in P@10). It accords with the previ-ous conclusion by Craswell et al[11] that BM25 ranking applied to link anchor documents significantly outperforms the same ranking method applied to doc-ument content. However, even anchor text retrieval on .GOV gets much worse performance than TREC 2003 best run. It can be explained by the fact that these results don X  X  make use of any kind of non-content information. mance than that on .GOV. Similar with retrieval results on .GOV, anchor text retrieval on key resource set outperforms full text retrieval by about 35% in both evaluation metrics. However, from Fig. 8, we can see both full text and anchor text retrieval gain much progress on key resource set. Anchor text retrieval on key resource set achieves almost the same ranking as TREC 2003 best run (cf. Table 2).
 method. TREC 2003 topic distillation topics and relevant qrels are not used for training in any way. BM2500 ranking based on link anchor of the key resource set gets the 2nd highest R-precision and 4th highest Precision at 10 according to TREC 2003 topic distillation task results. Further improvement is expected if better stemming and parameter tuning technology are introduced.
 set. It proves that key resource set has included a large number of high quality pages. This set can be used for topic distillation instead of the whole page set. In this paper, an effective topic distillation method with key resource pre-selection is proposed. Experiments prove that information retrieval on this pre-selected key resource page set gets much better performance than that on the whole collection. We can conclude that: 1. A small sub-set of web pages which contains most key resource pages can be 2. Decision tree learning is fit for the job of selecting key resources using non-3. Pre-selection of key resource pages works well for topic distillation according losing performance in topic distillation. It can also be used to evaluate web page quality query-independently based on whether it is a key resource or not. in future work: Will we get better results if existing link analysis methods such as HITS and PageRank are performed on this set? In-site out-link analysis has proved effective in key resource selection, how well does retrieval on in-site out-link anchor instead of in-link anchor in the key resource set? Is it possible to find the best trade off point between key resource set size and key resource coverage?
