 Exploring community is fundamental for uncovering the connections between structure a nd function of complex networks and for practical applications in many disciplines such as biology and sociology. In this paper, we propose a TTR-LDA-Community model which combines the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (LDA) and the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm with an inference mechanism. The model is then applied to data from Delicious, a popular social tagging system, over the time period of 2005-2008. Our results show that 1) users in the same community tend to be interested in similar set of topics in all time periods; and 2) topics may divide into several sub-topics and scatter into different communities over time. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model and show that the TTR-LDA-Community model is meaningful for understanding communities and outperforms TTR-LDA and LDA m odels in tag prediction.

Intuitively, the heterogeneity of the user groups, the huge quantities of various resources bookmarked, and the variety of interactions among the users provide intrinsic evidence for the existence of user communities. Thus, an important task in network analysis is to detect communities and explore their features, which can improve community-supporting services at the community-level in the context of a social tagging system. Many studies in various di sciplines have been devoted to community detection; however, few of them have systematically and quantitatively studied the profiles of those detected communities (for example: the dynamic features of those detected communities; the semantic analysis of those communities which are detected mainly according to link relationship among users). unsupervised method to summarize the contents of large document collections. The classic model is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [1]. These mode ls and their extensions use simple surface features such as word occurrences within documents to reveal the semantic content of documents. In this paper, we propose a TTR-LDA-Comm unity model, which is an inferential combination of an extended LDA model and a betweenness-based community det ection algorithm. It provides rich, systematic, and quantitative information about the profiles of detected communities. works, Section 3 discusses the me thod, including the dataset used and the proposed TTR-LDA-Community model. Section 4 presents the results of applying th e proposed model to a real world dataset, Section 5 evaluates th e methods and results. Section 6 concludes our study. extended LDA models have been used for automatic topic extraction from large-scale corpora. In the context of social tagging systems, where multiple users are annotating resources, the resulting topics reflect a shared view of the document; and the tags of the topics reflect a co mmon vocabulary. As for community detection, the most representative approaches include centrality or betweenness-based approaches and graph partitioning-based approaches. Girvan and Newman extended the betweenness measure to edges and designe d a clustering algorithm which gradually removes the edges with the highest betweenness value [4]. This algorithm has been improved through modularity; and the complexity is reduced from O(m 2 n) to O(mdlogn) where d is the depth of the dendrogram of the community structure [2]. Many studies provide various models and algorithms for topic mining and community detection; yet, few of them have integrated those models and algorithms, performed topic mining for detected communities, and analyzed how those identified topics change among communities over time. These questions are addressed in this study. components: tag, tagger and res ource. The experimental dataset contains all the triples of thes e three components and the time and date of their creation on Delic ious from 2005 to 2008. In data processing, all taggers were ra nked by the number of resources they have bookmarked and the top 50,000 taggers were selected as the sample of taggers. These taggers bookmarked a total of 354,522 web pages, which were sort ed by the number of taggers who bookmarked them. The top 10,000 resources were selected as the sample of web pages, associated with which a dominant majority of tagging activities occurred. Thus a co-bookmark network was built in which a connection between two users (within the sample of 50,000 taggers) is created if they bookmarked the same resources (within the sample of 10,000 web pages). In addition, in order to observe the evolution of structure and motif of communities, the time span (2005-2008) was divided into three slices. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the data in the three time slices. TTR-LDA model and the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm, using inference mechanis m. The model is illustrated in Figure 1. TTR-LDA is developed based on ACT model [11][12]. It is a three-layer Bayesian model with taggers tap in each post p topics denoted as latent variable z as the middle layer. distribution over detected communities. Each community includes a set of taggers, who have a st ronger relationship with other taggers within the community than the taggers outside. Based on the taggers X  information model, the probability distribution of each tagger over a set of topics is obtained by using the TTR-LDA model while the community structure of taggers is revealed by the community detection algorithm. The two sets of results are further integrated through an inferen ce mechanism. The function of inference mechanism can be described below: taggers { he/she has a corresponding probab ility distribution over T topics community, its probability distribution over T topics can be distributions of taggers, but also explore how they evolve over time. Taggers and their co-bookmark activities are divided into four time slices (from 2005 to 2008) . The fourth time slice (2008), which had the highest number of ta ggers, is further divided into four periods. communities occupies a major proportion in the four years (2005-2008) and the proportion is increasing over time. Posts created during September 2008 to December 2008 are used as training data. A test set of 3,000 is built by sampling 1 out of every 100 posts from these 43,453 distinct taggers and 350,721 different posts. Perplexity is used to id entify the number of topics [10], which arrives at the lowest point when the number of topics is 150. The interest model of each tagger in the top five largest communities is then built based on their topic distributions. Taking the largest community in the period as an example, the topic distribution of all the taggers is shown in Figure 2. a topic distribution of the largest community can be created (Figure3). We can find that the t opic distributions in a community are diverse because users X  relationships in that community are mainly based on their co-bookmark activities not the similarity of their interest model. design an experiment as follows: 1) denote the five largest communities from each time slice in 2008 as community_i_t where t means the tth time slice in 2008 and i means the ith largest community in tth time slice; 2) compute the topic distribution for the five communities, which is stored as model_t_i_Topic(j) , the probability of jth topic in ith largest community in the tth time slice; 3) obtain the probability distribution of tags that are collected from all the posts generated during the specific time slice; the probability of one tag occurring in a topic shows the level of representativeness of the tag for that topic; 4) sort all the tags according to their probability value in each topic and select the 20 top ranked tags to represent the content of the topics; select the top 5 ranked topics to represent the theme of each community; and 5) analyze the similarity between different communities from different time slice through compu ting how many tags are shared by the two different communities. More specifically, we compare current time slice with its previous time slice, for example, we compare community_i_t with community_j_t-1(j=1, 2...5) . most large-scale communities have a high similarity with community_1_2 that is mainly on topics related to computer technology. When it comes to the 2nd time slice, the set of topics is divided into two groups: one is related to web technology; the other is about java and business. As for the 4th time slice, the first two communities are purely about web design, and the second two communities are about Web 2.0, so cial networks and business. The size of communities along evolutionary lines fluctuates over time. For example, the size of the community about social networks in the 3rd time slice ( community_1_3 ) is much larger (4,377) than that (521) in the 4th time slice ( community_5_4 ). Community model is evaluated, including the quality of detected communities, topic mining, and comparison with other related algorithms. Community Detection Evaluation (from single criterion scores) are used to evaluate the quality of communities detected by the TTR-LDA-Community model [6]. The smaller the value of conductan ce is, the higher the granularity of a community is. Network commun ity profile (NCP) is used to compute and display the value of conductance for communities [5]. Whiskers networks and rewi red networks are adopted as two comparative aspects. Whiskers is defined as the maximal sub graphs that can be detached from the rest of the network by removing a single edge; and a rewired network is a random network that has the same nodes and the same degree distribution as the original network [5]. The conductance of communities of the rewired original network (blue line in the left figure), rewired random network (red dashed line in the left figure), the original whiskers network (blue line in the right figure), and the random whiskers network (red dashed line in the right figure) are calculated and shown in Figure 4. rewired whiskers (right), 1) the or iginal network displays a higher granularity of communities (a lower conductance value); 2) the value of conductance as the function of the size of communities in the original network and the or iginal whiskers present a  X  X  X  shape, showing properties of a true large social networks [5]; 3) the original whiskers has the best community granularity (the lowest conductance) between size 10-100; and 4) the best community granularity of rewired original network is around 1000. evaluate the quality of a division of a network into communities [6]. The modularity value of those detected communities in different time periods is shown in Table 2. The modularity of communities in the four time slices of 2008 is better than that in 2005-2007. This is probably due to the fact that community structure grows mature gradua lly over time, creating better communities in later years than in earlier years. Meanwhile, modularity of communities in the short-term (four sub periods in 2008) is larger than the long-term (2008). It can be explained that in different time periods, most taggers X  bookmarking activities are focused on different domains, so in a certain short-term time period, communities may be quite different from each other. However, when those time periods are merged together, the taggers show different interests in many domains; so the clustering feature within the communities becomes weaker. Topic Mining Evaluation 2008-2009 in Delicious is examined. Results show that the most popular topics are about bandslash fiction, fan fiction, and supernatural fiction (the top 3 popular topics). Communities with similar theme are ranked 3rd, 4th, and 5 th in size; and the web resources with similar topics are ranked 500-600 of the top 1000 ranked resources in number of tagge rs associated with them. We also inspect how topics of the top 1,000 resources are distributed in different communities. In Table 3, the i in Topic i(j) means the ith topic in 1000 most popular resource and j denotes the ith topic is ranked as j in all the 300 topics. The top 20 ranked topics in 1000 most popular resources can be found in 5 largest communities in different time periods. For each community, there exists at least one topic that is ranked top 10 in 1000 most popular resources (Table 3). Model Evaluation respectively from LDA, TTR -LDA model, and TTR-LDA-Community model based on co-bookmark network in a given period (Oct. 2008 X  X ec. 2008). One resource and five tags are recommended for each post according to the results of three models separately. Taking recomme nding resources to posts as an example, the web resource that has the highest probability of occurring in a post is recommended to that very post. The results are shown in Table 4. made by using LDA because LDA only provides the probability distribution of posts over topics. The TTR-LDA and TTR-LDA-Community model show si gnificant improvement for recommendation of tags and resources for post in terms of precision, recall and F1-Measure. TTR-LDA and TTR-LDA-Community have slightly impr oved performance for  X  X ags for post X , while TTR-LDA-Community outperforms TTR-LDA on  X  X esource for post X . which is an integrated model, which combines TTR-LDA and Community detection using an in ference mechanism. By applying this model to Delicious data, the community structure of active taggers, the topic distributions within communities, and the representative taggers, tags, and resources within these communities were observed. Using community detection, the changes in community structure over time were detected. In particular, social tagging communities seem to experience a large intake of newcomers, significantly altering the participant base over time. There also is evidence of a dominance of large communities: the largest of the communities incorporate the majority of participants, although many smaller communities exist. As for topical features of comm unities, obvious difference exists between communities. Some communities have a core group of topics, while the topic profiles for other communities are varied. Topics may also appear in a few communities simultaneously, and then split into sub-topics and scatter through different communities. In summary, topics seem to be a dynamic feature of communities: emerging, blending, and disappearing over time. The proposed model provides bette r understanding of the features of communities in social taggi ng system and provides better opportunities for group recommendation, group prediction and other applications for future resear ch in social tagging. Our future work will focus on building a Dynamic TTR-LDA-Community model, which incorporates evolution of both topics and communities. In addition, future work should explore the dynamic topical features of community profiling. [1] Blei, D.M., Ng, A.Y., &amp; Jordan, M.I. (2003). Latent Dirichlet allocation.
