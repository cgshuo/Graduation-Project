 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Retrieval Models cluster hypothesis
The cluster hypothesis states that  X  X losely associated doc-uments tend to be relevant to the same requests X  [1]. This is one of the most fundamental and influential hypotheses in the field of information retrieval and has given rise to a huge body of work.

In this tutorial we will present the research topics that have emerged based on the cluster hypothesis. Specific fo-cus will be placed on cluster-based document retrieval, the use of topic models for ad hoc IR, and the use of graph-based methods that utilize inter-document similarities. Fur-thermore, we will provide an in-depth survey of the suite of retrieval methods and techniques that rely, either explic-itly or implicitly, on the cluster hypothesis and which are used for a variety of different tasks; e.g., query expansion, query-performance prediction, fusion and federated search, search-results diversification.
The primary objective of this tutorial is to present the cluster hypothesis and the lines of research to which it has given rise. To this end, much emphasis will be put on fun-damental retrieval techniques and principles that are based on the cluster hypothesis and which have been used for a variety of IR tasks. The more specific goals of the tutorial are to provide attendees with (i) the required background to pursue research in topics that are based on the cluster hypothesis; (ii) an overview of the different tasks for which the cluster hypothesis can be leveraged; and, (iii) fundamen-
