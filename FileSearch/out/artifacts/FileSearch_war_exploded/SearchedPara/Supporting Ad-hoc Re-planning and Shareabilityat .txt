 In this paper we present results from a research and development project focusing on the use of mobile phones at a music festival. Our aim is to explore how the festival experience can be enhanced with the introduction of mobile services. Two questions are addressed: Are there any design-openings for new services supporting groups at large-scale events? If so, what design challenges can be identified as important to consider in order to enhance the festival experience? Our conclusion is that there are several design-openings for new services supporting groups at large-scale events. We identify two different design challenges to address when designing new services; Supporting ad-hoc re-planning and shareability. The study contributes to better suited designs of services and technology in mobile settings as this music festival as well as for other large-scale events.

General Terms Design, Human Factors Keywords Mobility, Large-scale Event, Ethnography, Festival, Coordination, Planning, Groups, Mobile Service, Interaction Design A music festival is aimed to be a joyful experience for the audience, the participants. They create an experience by actively participating in the event. During a limited period of time people from different locations, gathers together, camp, party and are away from home. They listen to music, meet new friends, some are awake all night long. The use context for mobile technology is extreme -no power supplies, and often either hot sun or cold rain. Still, participants bring their mobile phones to those events -resulting in an interest for the events from cell-phone operators and developers, and researchers. In this paper we present results from a study conducted within a research and development project focusing on the use of mobile phones at large-scale events, e.g. sport events and as in our case a music event. The overall project aim was to study, prototype and evaluate solutions for large-scale events that would be both viable and become a sought-after item. The study was threefold and had a business, user, and technology focus. Our part of the study was to focus on the user i.e. in this case the festival visitor and potential end-user of any future mobile service aimed at the large-scale event market. We have conducted observational studies during three different years at the festival.
 Our aim in this paper is to explore how the festival experience can be enhanced with the introduction of mobile services. Our approach to do this investigation has been to observe what the participants actually do how they use mobile technology and also let them use prototype services. Are there any design-openings for new services supporting groups at large-scale events? If so, what design challenges can be identified as important in order to enhance the festival experience? With design openings we refer to opportunities to create added value, to look for possible ways a practice can evolve [1]. Our results are valuable for researchers interested in-group coordination in a mobile setting and also useful for developers or companies in the telecom area working with applications aiming at the large-scale events market. How people use technology to coordinate and plan their work has long been an important research topic within the research fields of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) [2, 3] [4] [5]. Recently attention has been given to domains outside the office or the control room, such as domestic life, mobile work and leisure activities. The move from fixed place interaction to mobile interaction has put new demands on research methodology as well as on technology development. There is an increasing body of literature covering areas such as studies of teenagers X  use of mobile phones, cultural differences of mobile phone use in public spaces, use of technology in e.g. snow cleaning vehicles and building maintenance and motorcyclists X  social interaction through mobile technology [6] [7] [8] [9]. One specific type of setting studied is technology use in large-scale events such as; rallies, city festivals, and music festivals [10] [11] [12] [13] [14].
 Lexhagen et al [11] conducts a study with focus on the use of a mobile coordination service tried at the music festival Storsj X yran. The service is aimed to facilitate coordination among all kind of members involved e.g. crew, gatekeepers etc. An important difference between Lexhagen et al.s X  study is that they focus on supporting the organizers, while our focus is on supporting the participants. However, it contains similar information as e.g. delays and program changes as our service does. They conclude that to motivate usage of the mobile coordination service it is important that it is found useful and enjoyable; this is also the case in our study regarding the visitor X  X  use of such tools. Also Bertelsen [14] has focused on the organizers and emphasizes that  X  X rganisational learning is crystallised into artifacts X . He uses an example from a Danish music festival where the use of a checklist is in focus. The checklist had three functions as a tool: collection of information during planning, medium for forwarding information, and as a tool on stage during the event. Bertelsen says that  X  X n general, artefacts are crystallisations of the use of an earlier artefact X  which in this case was notes on paper that evolved into a pre-printed checklist. Even though we do not look at organizational learning per se we find this example relevant since in our case the paper-based program booklet is the origin that is now in our project object for a tryout with a new digital version, and the organizers of the music festival support this tryout.
 Jacucci et al [12] and Peltonen et al [15] reports on studies exploring the use of mobile technology in different settings. Jacucci et al [12] introduces a group media application called mGroup, designed for specators at large-sclae events. The application that works on a multimedia equipped mobile phone supports groups in creating and sharing experiences during the rally event. Jaccuci et al. conclude that the spectatorship is active and that it is important to share experiences in a group, their application supports both instant sharing and creation of shared digital memories through creation of media stories. Peltonen et al [15] continue to explore active spectatorship where social interaction with other spectators during the event is crucial and contradicting to previous knowledge where the spectator often was seen as a passive consumer. The focus in this study is on a large display in an urban area and not only mobile media sharing though the group is equally important here and there is a need to share media content among the members in a group, which we find relevant also for our study. This project lasted for three years. In total approximately 20 researchers with different interests from academia and industry participated in the project. A number of methods were combined in order to get an as good understanding of the festival as possible. The results in this paper are mainly based on the ethnographic studies.
 Within CSCW methods suitable for gaining understanding of e.g. social aspects are used in order to gain knowledge on technology in use. The methodological and analytical approach in this paper is in line with other research within this field of CSCW. Hence, the basis is an ethnographic field study, for collecting data, where we have used; observations (field notes), digital video recording, and digital photo camera as starting point. In combination with taking pictures and scribble down field notes we also approached groups of participants to perform short informal interviews that we below will discuss in more detail. The festival we have visited is called the Hultsfred festival. This festival is a three days long annual event occurring in mid June. Around 30 000 participants travel to the small city of Hultsfred to attend the music festival, this just about doubles the population in the municipality. A lot of the inhabitants are in one way or another involved in the event, either during preparations or they work as volunteers during the event. About 6000 volunteers work in shifts during the event, they are also counted as participants since they trade work for a festival ticket. The studies reported in this paper are our second and third from this festival in the project called  X  X he Wireless Festival X . Within this project research questions regarding the use of mobile technologies at large-scale events, e.g. sport events and music events, are explored from a business, technology and user perspective, with focus on possibilities for future mobile services. The project lasted for a period of three years and everything from sub-projects to design activities followed an iterative process.
 We have conducted three ethnographic studies (see Table 1); Year 1: The first study was rather open-ended. Since this was the first time for us at the festival the aim was to find out who the festival participants were, understand how they used technology, and also to find out about their needs regarding information. The approach taken was to be like a fly on the wall, to observe people at distance and try not to intervene too much. Still we approached some people and performed informal interviews.
 Year 2: The second year we conducted several informal interviews with participants to the festival. The focus was on how the participants planned their visit, what artifacts they used to coordinate and how they used them. We also wanted to interview groups of people, which meant that we searched for those. On a few occasions we were two different groups performing the interviews. We negotiated access to groups of people at the festival, not just for interviewing them, but also for shadowing them. The lesson learned from the study was that most participants are happy to spend some time and tell about their experiences. It is also possible to hang out 
Table 1 The table shows an overview of the Wireless Festival project during its three years. It focuses on activities where with people, simply by asking permission on site. The video camera is often thought of as being disturbing and we encountered this as a problem one or two times. Several of the people that we filmed didn X  X  have any obligations about being filmed and at the field we didn X  X  feel that what they said and did was affected by the presence of a video camera more than us intervening with them.
 Year 3: The third year we narrowed our study down to focusing on how the participants coordinate and plan their activities. The idea was to conduct evaluative ethnography that takes as the point of departure ideas for design. Rather than beginning with fieldwork prior to design, evaluative ethnography can be seen as  X  X anity-checks X  of design ideas already created [5] p. 434). Our approach was to evaluate the Dynamic Booklet mobile service concept by looking at the current use of the paper-based program booklet. Some input was also collected through short demos of the service during our interviews. This year we also applied two different approaches during the field study. The first day we approached mobile phone users with aim on finding users of either the DB service or of Mobile Internet in general in order to find a number of participants willing to try the service during the festival. We managed to find five persons that would like to do this and talk with us either on the last day of the festival (Saturday) or after the festival, to give us some long-time usage comments on the service. This is a kind of  X  X ire and forget X  approach  X  inspired by the work about cultural probes [16], as researcher you don X  X  need to be present as the users try out the service. This section gives an account on how participants plan and coordinate their everyday activities at the festival. The material reported upon here is gathered from about 15 group interviews, one shorter shadowing session and a 1h long shadowing session and finally from additional material made from observations from a distance. There are many things to take into consideration when planning for the maximum festival experience. Since there often are several concerts going on in parallel and because it takes some time to move from one stage to another, from the camping area (due to the crowded setting and queuing at the entrances to the festival area) and also since even though you may be in a group this does not mean that all members necessarily have the same taste in music. Our study shows that mainly three different paper-based artifacts were used among the groups in order to manage planning of their everyday activities at the festival. People used the program booklet, different kind of printouts and a staff version of the program booklet. Additional information worth mentioning is that most groups built up their daily activities around the music but some said that it was weather dependent and others preferred to simply hang around the campsite.
 A couple of weeks before the festival starts the whole program is published on the organizers webpage. At this page there is also the possibility to print the whole schedule or to put together your own schedule. This seemed to be a common activity and a lot of groups mentioned that they had done so. However, almost every second of them had forgot to bring their program to the festival, a pity since some had put down a considerable amount of time planning what to do.
 When onsite there is a possibility to buy a paper-based program booklet. Some groups said that they now choose to use this booklet instead since it includes additional information about all bands. All groups we met had access to this program. The participants either had one program of their own or they shared a number of programs within the group.
 It was also common to make annotations in the program. Both to mark which bands to see as well as keeping track of the ones they actually went to see. When asked they told us that they keep the book as a memory, a sort of diary from this year X  X  festival. During the second year it was an anniversary for the festival so all nights at exactly 20.05 there was a surprise concert given. That is the one they are referring to in this excerpt. We have seen several examples of people making annotations in their program booklets, and the group we shadowed were not an exception. Figure 1 The figure shows an annotated program booklet. The group uses  X  X tars X  in order to mark concerts they would like to visit. The concerts they actually visited are marked with a circle. In top of the page they have written the name of the band that played during the surprise concert. 18-21 is a note about that one of the participants in the group need to work as During our shadowing session they used the paper booklet frequently, first for planning and secondly for information while moving through the area e.g. when they pass a stage and don X  X  know whom is playing there. They do this checking out while mobile, by simply take out the program booklet to have a quick look. The example is an illustration of how the paper-based program booklet is used on the move. It also shows how the booklet is shared between two people. What we have seen here is a very well functioning sharing of the booklet between the two girls. One asked for the program and immediately got it from her friend. She took a quick glance in it and handed it back. This sharing is something we also have noted during our observations and informal interviews. Not only sharing the program booklet but other artifacts as well, e.g. the water bottle, the mobile phone when used as watch etc. We find it important to point out that especially the program booklet turns out to be a  X  X hareable artifact X , since this is something that needs to be taken into consideration when designing a digital counterpart. The one, who needs the program at the moment, gets it. This is an illustration of how the paper-based program booklet is collaboratively used by a group of participants. This example shows us how the booklet supports collaborative use, e.g. the program booklet can easily be viewed simultaneously by several group members positioned with the booklet in the centre of them. We chose to refer to this as shareability in practice . The booklet, or paper per se, also supports pointing and it is easy to flip between pages to find what you are looking for. The example also shows how artifacts are used together  X  how the program booklet and the mobile phone are juxtaposed. At the same time the example shows that it is not so straightforward to find the information they are looking for. In order to find it Louise, Vera and Albert helps each other out and point at the descriptive text. Large-scale events characteristics such as their temporality in time, spatial distribution, location that often requires travel away from home for the event participants, are facts common for rather diverse events e.g. sport events such as rallies, city festivals and as in our case music festivals [11] [12] [17] [15].
 From our fieldwork we have gathered a large amount of data and created an understanding of the festival visitor X  X  everyday while being at the event. Participants use e.g. mobile phones, program booklets and home-made running-orders, to coordinate their stay at the festival. They had no interest in mobile technology per se but they showed interest in what a mobile application could do for their overall visitor (user) experience when at the event, whether it is around the food-court, at the camping area or near the stages. According to our ethnographic study participants use the paper-based program booklet or homemade running orders frequently in order to plan and coordinate their activities. Actually when it comes to planning their day during the festival it seems to us that this is one of the main thing participants do. If there are different music interests within the same group they might even negotiate around a satisfactory solution e.g. one group member told us that since she whished to see one band and the others had followed her she now had to come with them to another concert. Another thing to take into consideration is the fact that it takes time to move between different stages and also that some concerts are running more or less in parallel. This leads to a constant mix between planning and improvisation, Sherry and Salvador has identified this  X  that there is a thorough mixing of planning and improvisation in the course of much of daily life, and particularly in the midst of mobility  X  X 18]. Another commonality is that participants most often come together in groups as they share an interest e.g. a music genre or a specific band when going to a music festival, this proved to be true also in our case. The participants X  intent was to spend their time at the festival together with their group of friends as much as possible, but due to e.g. slightly different music taste and parallel ongoing sessions, at different stages, the groups had to negotiate, split up temporarily and come together again later on. Our observations and interviews revealed that there was a more or less constant process of coordination and planning going on within the groups to solve and set the plan for the day. This planning, in many cases, even started some time ahead of the festival. Late changes in the daily program running-order also led to re-negotiation within the groups. Sometimes other factors such as crowded areas, weather conditions and choice of food during lunch time could lead to that the members of the groups split up unintentionally and had troubles finding each other later on which in turn could affect the earlier made up plan for the day.
 During our shadowing sessions we observed a frequent use of the paper-based program booklet. We noted that the booklet is a shareable artifact and that it also was frequently shared among the group members. When analyzing this we came to think about some differences compared to the mobile phone. A mobile phone is generally thought of as a personal and very private belonging. This might be important to have in mind when designing new mobile services. Although some sharing of the mobile phone has been observed previously between teenagers, in a study made at public places such as caf X s and on trams [19] [20]. If the program booklet shall successfully be integrated into a mobile service functioning in a mobile phone, it must still support the notion of being a shareable artifact . It also has to support a fast access , simply take it up and have a glance at the program, in order to support the truly mobile work practice that the festival participants have while being at the festival. The printed program booklet has all the properties that are talked about when discussing paper [21]. It is easy to bring, the information is persistent (when you open it you can see at a glance what is written) and it support both overview and more detailed data. We have seen how people while walking borrow a program booklet, open it, and find the information they need at the moment. If we are going to design a mobile service that can compete with the program booklet it need to support the truly mobile setting. During the festival we had the benefit of being able to provide participants with access to a prototype of a mobile service, The Dynamic Booklet (DB). DB is a mobile application prototype based on the festival official program booklet, but with the advantage of being updated with e.g. late changes. It consists of four parts available to choose among on the portal page of the service. They are: News (In Swedish: Nyheter), Running-order (Spelschema), Today X  X  question (Dagens fr X ga) and Forum. Additionally there are a logo and a link provided by the events main sponsor. The Running-order idea is fetched from the paper-based program booklet of the festival. It consists of four possible choices for the user:  X  X ight now X ,  X  X ay X ,  X  X earch for artist X  and  X  X tages X . The right now function lists what is currently going on at each stage and 20 minutes forward which makes it a good and overviewable option. The day option lists the acts according to day (Thursday, Friday and Saturday) in chronological order. Search for artists allows the user to enter the first letter in the artists name or part of the name to search by. Stages list all the stages and from here the user can select e.g. Pampas and all acts at Pampas will be listed. The running order is in contrast to the paper-based booklet, updated when late changes are made. The user can read more about the artists and pictures of the artists are provided with the description. The decision to develop a mobile service for the schedule came from different groups within the project, and from brainstorming sessions as well as from the festival management. It was informed by knowledge about what technology the participants used and how they used it. In a first step the mobile service would work as a complementary service to the paper-booklet i.e. not for replacement. The results reported upon here is from our analysis of both short-term and long-term tests by participants. The short-term test focused mostly on usability of the service and was gathered through the  X  X alk-aloud X  technique, open-ended interviews, and video recordings while our users tested the service. The data we collected during the short-term tests is about how easy it would be for a first time user to make sense of the service. It also tells us about how the service is experienced by a first-time user. While the long-term tests, on the other hand, are more about the end-user experience and satisfaction with the service. Did the DB fulfill a need? Was it found useful? The discussion is based on the open-ended interviews we 
Figure 4 Screenshots showing: (left) Home of the news page, (middle) One of the news containing a change in the running-order, and (right) Home of the forum with the options of had with the participants that tested the service. By letting the users use the service for several days we got valuable accounts for how they used it, when they used it and what they used it for. The part of the services that our long-term testers reported having tried mostly during the festival was the news service, the day schedule and foremost the right now service. The  X  X ight now X  part was mostly used later on during the evening when the concerts were held. Sometimes to check the band out at the stage where they were currently listening and sometimes to check out what was going on at the other stages. One test user told us that he used the service every other hour and mainly used it during the concerts in the way described above. This user also told us that people had asked who was playing and our user had showed them with the help of the DB. One observation regarding effectiveness and efficiency of the service is the fact that the user experience of the service is not just dependent on the actual design of the service, but also on the context it is used in. A mobile service is very dependent on network coverage and how fast the network is. If many people are using it at the same time it may be slow. At the festival a lot of people are using their phones in different ways when the concert is over. At the same time this is visible for the users. The fact that the service had a simple design building upon plain menus that were recognizable for those who use Internet might have eased the learnability and memorability. Two users said the following:  X  X  used a bit more time in the beginning to go through the different menus after that it was easy X .
 Our results show that the users liked the service. It did not matter if they only tried it for 5-15 minutes or if they used it multiple times from Thursday until Saturday. They had no problems starting to use the DB and they said that they found the service useful. Those that tested the service longer thought the service was good support for them during the festival, and they would like to see the DB at other similar events.
 Our conclusion is that the participants testing the service found ways to integrate the service into their work practice at the festival. However, the current version of the DB lacked one important thing, namely support for groups. Based on the conclusions from on one hand the visitor groups use of different paper-based artifacts for coordination and planning and on the other hand the use of the DB, we have identified several design challenges that we have found important in the research to consider having as features in the design of a mobile application shared program booklet for large-scale events.
 Despite that the DB was found useful by the festival participants it lacked a few things, foremost that was specific group support functionality for coordinating and planning the day regarding whom will see what band, together with whom and also allowing late changes to be communicated within the group when being apart. We will as an answer to this present the extended dynamic program booklet design concept which is a mobile application with built-in group support especially tailored for groups of participants going to and being at mobile spatially distributed large-scale events with parallel sessions going on.
 Given what we have seen a mobile service must not take attention away from what is the festival participants X  primary goal, having fun party and listen to music together with their friends. There are some problems identified in this setting that the participants X  today face, to support them in and make it easier poses for us several design challenges. These are challenges that we have to deal with if going to support the interaction at a festival, where the actual interaction with a mobile phone is just a small, small, part. This far we have identified two design challenges: Below we will discuss the design challenges and some features that would be useful in future mobile services. Right now service  X  on the move: The extended dynamic program booklet design concept with the working name  X  X he Event Mobile Application Shared Program Booklet X  (hereafter referred to as  X  X MA X ) is a continuation of the DB prototype. From the original prototype design we would like to keep the popular  X  X ight now X  function since this part supports the ad-hoc character of the planning and coordination identified in the field studies. How it was used during the trials suggests one important way that the service could enhance the festival experience in the future, namely through providing updated information during the festival. More generally it points towards a use pattern of this kind of mobile services at large scale events, where the participants can use the artifact best suited all the time. At home they use the webpage in order to decide if they want to go, making a plan for what they want to see. They print the plan. When arriving to the festival they either buy a festival program booklet or use their printouts as a program. Either way the mobile service complements the use of computers at home, the printouts and the program booklet, since it provides its users with updated information. Personal plan before and during the event: The second feature we see a need to add is a personal planning function. At Hultsfred Rock Festival this was possible, but only on beforehand from home using a computer. The user had to print the plan and remember to bring it to the festival. We would like to extend this functionality so that the personal program can be saved , accessed via EMA and be updateable both from PC and from a mobile phone . In this way we allow the participants to amend their plan during the event and since it will be accessible via the phone it does not matter if they should forget their print-out at home. Preferably it shall be possible to take the program in the DB as point of departure but it shall also be possible to build your own plan from scratch without using the organizers program version. Annotations serving as memorabilia: The importance of saving the program booklet with personal annotations afterwards as memorabilia from the festival was highlighted from several participants. Thus making annotations must be made possible in relation to e.g. the running-order or the personal plan which way to use it should be left to the user to decide. The official program, the personal program as well as the annotations shall be possible to save and share between mobile phone and PC. During the event the participants also takes photos of their friends as well as of the artist when at a concert. The option to attach photos to a certain annotation or program point would most likely turn out to be appreciated. Thinking of social media with Twitter and different kinds of blogs and mo-blogs possibilities there are today. Support for group functionality: Shareability turned out to be the missing object when observing the first version of the DB and how the visitor groups used the paper-based program booklet. There are several different ways to add shareability to the EMA and we think that a combination would be the most valuable option. Firstly we suggest that it shall be possible to share ones personal program with one or several friends. But the owner of the program shall be able to decide who will have access to their personal plan and the plan shall be in read only mode for those. Adding a possibility for friends to add a comment could be done, but this should not affect the look of the program considering the still rather limited space on the screen of a mobile phone avoiding scrolling due to comments would be good. If adding a commenting function, the comments shall be presented last on each page. Secondly it shall be possible to view the different group members plans in an overview-able manner like the  X  X ight now function X  but for the group. For example: At Pampas stage 21:00-22:30  X  X creaming Ballads X , Tim and Andy, At Hawaii stage, 21:15-22:45  X  X ithin Temptation X , Rebecka, Jennie, Fred and Jan. At camping area: Lucy. Of course the fact that the groups plan is like this does not guarantee that the members actually are at the places planed to be. But now it is up to each and one to either update their plan or e.g. write a short comment as Tim: has gone back to the camping area, lousy band... To view the whole evening at once like in the running-order would be another way of presenting the information. We argue for the possibility to choose between those. However to view full day with all group members plans might be technically demanding and it might therefore be better to display each members full day plan separately and there use the running-order way.
 We think that it is very important to address the shareability issue and by doing so we believe that social awareness will be strengthened within the group of friends. Even though visiting different parallel ongoing concerts, i.e. not seeing each other, the pure knowledge of knowing where the others are might create a positive feeling of connectedness among the group members. This could be further developed by also adding the feature of presenting group members actual location to each other as has previously been discussed separately in the context of large-scale events [13] or support interpersonal awareness by proximity indicator as discussed in [22]. This would however be a separate feature from the shareability functionality. Technically we haven X  X  solved how the sharing of personal programs during the large-scale event should be done yet. But early thoughts of letting the groups create a group account and via this handle the information might be a good solution. Also worth thinking of are both interactional issues and issues regarding integrity, privacy and security which we chose to only mention in this paper. In this paper we have addressed two questions: The short answer to the first question is  X  X es X . The more elaborated is -what we have seen at this festival concerning groups, planning, coordination, sharing of experiences and attitude towards mobile services shows several design-openings for new services. The teenagers we have met are not interested in the latest technology there is, instead they are looking for something that can give them an added value and thus enhance their festival experience, not the technology per se. Thus the knowledge gained here and the ideas regarding features for a large-scale event mobile service where social awareness, fast and basic technology is used in order to achieve an enhanced festival experience we argue is the recipe for successfully reaching a larger market. The answer to the second question is that we need to address the design challenges regarding how they use the technology today. The results from our data provides us with valuable knowledge on the festival participants coordination, planning, social and mobile interaction. Visiting a festival is foremost a group activity. The festival experience wouldn X  X  be the same unless you can share it with your friends.
 We have identified two design challenges; With the design challenges exemplified by the event mobile application shared program booklet  X  X MA X , design concept, we have met the demands of visitor groups coming to diverse kinds of large-scale events. Covering large-scale events from e.g. soccer or tennis tournaments to the Olympic Games within sport, to city festivals, conferences and as in our case music festivals. To sum up we would like to point out that mobile technology can be used to give visiting groups a better user experience of a large-scale event by supporting ad-hoc re-planning and shareability.
