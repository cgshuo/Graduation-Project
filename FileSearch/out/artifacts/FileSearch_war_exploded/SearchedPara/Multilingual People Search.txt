 People Search is an important search service with multiple applications (eg. looking up a friend on Facebook, finding colleagues in corporate email directories etc). With the pro-portion of non-English users on a steady rise, people search services are being used by users from diverse language de-mographics. Users may issue name search queries against these directories in languages other than the language of the directory, in which case the present monolingual name search approaches will not work. In this demo, we present a Multilingual People Search system capable of performing fast name lookups on large user directories, independent of the directory language. Our system has applications in areas like social networking, enterprise search and email address book search.

People Search is a well studied problem, but not in a multilingual setting. One could adapt existing monolingual sytems to the multilingual environment by transliterating user queries to the language of the directory. However, such a system would have low accuracy and high response time because of the intermediate transliteration step making it impractical.

We tackle the problem by representing names using a lan-guage/script independent representation learned by employ-ing Machine Learning techniques [1],[2]. The key idea is to treat names written in two languages/scripts as parallel views of the same semantic object. Given a training data set consisting of parallel name tokens in two languages, we employ Cannonical Correlation Analysis to learn hash func-tions for each language. These hash functions are used for indexing the directories. Subsequently, when performing a name search, the query is hashed and matching results are retrieved from the directory. The compact and computer friendly hash codes make indexing large directories possi-ble and offer efficient retrieval performance even on simple commodity hardware.

Some key advantages of our system are:
