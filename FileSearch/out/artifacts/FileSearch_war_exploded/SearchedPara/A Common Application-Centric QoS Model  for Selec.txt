 Service Grid is a service system for providing more powerful services for customers Currently, related researches on QoS are for resource allocation in Grid system [2-8] or for Web services [9-17], the former focus on the infrastructure such as CPU, mem-QoS, the latter focuses on the study of app lication-centric QoS. For simplification, in this paper, we denote them as Resource QoS(RQoS) and Application QoS(AQoS) Grid Services with service-oriented property, while, even though the QoS of Web Services and the QoS of Grid Services ar e typically AQoS, But the QoS of Web Ser-vices is not suitable completely to evaluate the QoS of Grid Services since their sup-porting technologies are not the same. 
In [9-17], the QoS of Web Services focus on AQoS, and based on these researches, the availability of the QoS is verified. But the supporting technology of stateless Web Services is not the same as that of stateful Grid Services. The researches [2-5] on QoS in computing Grid typically are GARA [3 ], GARA discusses the resource reservation based on capability of network, processors and storage devices, and gives some guid-longed to different owners. To overcome shortage of GARA, Rashid Al-Ali[6-8] in Cardiff University discussed the presentation schema of QoS, the process for coordi-are G-QoSM, in which, its architecture, how to coordinate and discover resources are addressed and RQoS are focused on. GM-QoS[11] is presented by Shang Hai Univer-sity based on AQoS, it only discusses the AQoS model suitable for manufacturing grids and is not a common AQoS model. This paper focuses on AQoS and proposed a common AQoS model named GS_QoS for evaluating Grid Services. The formal definition of GS_AQoS is given and the evaluation factors and the evaluation modes are addressed in detail. At last, in order to validate the availability of GS _AQoS and recommend some usable sugges-tions, some simulation experiments are made. According to the char acteristics of Grid Services, GS_AQoS model also includes three parts: (1) factors for evaluating Grid Services and their formulas. (2) Evaluation modes supporting for applications X  needs, namely evaluation algorithms provided based on evaluation factors. (3) Constraints on evaluation factors. Based on the three parts included in GS_AQoS model, the formal definition of GS_AQoS is given in the followings. Definition 1. GS_AQoS={ FN , OP , CS }, where, According to the definition of GS_AQoS above, it X  X  XML scheme is described as Fig.1, where, AQoS_Attribute is used to describe the evaluation factors, and Busines-factors, AQoS_SLA represents the evalua tion modes provided, each evaluation mode are transparent to users, they are not incl uded in the XML scheme of GS_AQoS. The information provided by customers following the XML schema is stored in Shunsaku Data Manager developed by FUJITSU. in GS_AQoS. 2.1 Evaluation Factors in GS_AQoS The evaluation factors belonged to GS_AQoS of different domains may be more different. Nevertheless, some common features can be summarized. In order to desig-discussing the difference between Grid Services and Web Services as well as the difference between computing grids and service grids, we give the following discus-sions:(1) Network bandwidth cannot be given a guarantee in current Internet envi-ronment, and existing researches are all restricted in private networks. But in the fu-ture, for the Internet supporting Ipv6, network bandwidth will play an important role in GS_AQoS. (2) Service-oriented Grid Services needs limited or little information to be transferred, so in stable network environment, the transmitting cost can be omitted, always care much for the total responding time and the result of Grid Services, so the GS_AQoS. (4) Grid Services provide flex ible information exchange mechanism, subscribed. So, Reliability that is much more important in QoS of Web Services is not included in GS_AQoS of Grid Services. (5 ) The Reputation is not needed since grid system provides services for customers transparently. 
Based on the discussions above, it is sure that the factors of GS_AQoS for evaluat-considered as their supplement. While, othe r factors should be designated on special domain X  X  demand. 
Usually, Price is provided by service provider, and Responding Time and Fidelity are calculated by monitor broker for giving creditability to customers, of course, it can described as following: Responding Time( T i p and T i ). Responding Time is the interval from the start time of with unique value provided by service provider, and T i is provided by monitor broker and denoted as: T i =( voked number of GS i invoked, when Fidelity is higher, T i p can be used as the informa-tion of Responding Time. Price( P ). Service provider provides Price. Fidelity( F ). Fidelity represents the promise given by service provider, which is usu-with other factors, it is denoted as: Where, n is the total invoked number, and No is the times that the faith is broken. 2.2 Evaluation Modes in GS_AQoS According to customers X  requirements, th e modes for selecting Grid Services are summarized as three types: (1) one factor is emphasized. (2) The ranges of values are satisfied. (3) Integrated performance is em phasized. Therefore, in GS_AQoS model, AQoS_value_range and AQoS_value_integration. Customers can apply one of them GS_AQoS, a i j is the value of jth evaluation factor of GS i . M AQoS = matrix made up of factors X  values of GSs. In the followings, we will give the defini-tions of GS_Best according to these three evaluation modes respectively. customers, then selecting broker selects Grid Services with optimal a k , denoted as: then Best(A k ) = Min(A k ) , and GS_Best is the set of Grid Services with lower Price. (2) AQoS_value_range Mode. GS_AQoS information of Grid Services selected will be in the range of values of that needed by customers, denoted as: [ L j , U (3) AQoS_value_integration Mode. Space vector distance is adopted to evaluate the integrated performance of Grid Services. and a threshold point is developed based on customers X  demand on Grid Services. Secondly, in order to improve the capability of processing, a subset of all the semantic based on their GS_AQoS information. Four thly, the space vector distances between of a Grid Service is, the better its integrated performance is. But before calculating the distance, all of the values of factors should be converted into the same range of quan-sents the threshold point based on the customers X  requirements, then mapping the ( a GS_Best={ GS i | D i  X  Max(D)  X  GS i  X  GS_S }. 
In GS_AQoS application, two steps are adopted, (1) based on the modes discussed best resource is reserved based on RQoS efficiently. 
In the following, we will give some simulation experiments based on GS_AQoS instance to verify availability and efficiency of GS_AQoS model. proach. First, we will give the experiment scenario, and then some tests are done and deduce some conclusions. 3. Scenario GS_AQoS model is applied in e-SGS prototype[19]. The processing of jobs are: (1) Local Broker receives jobs integrated by multi-Grid Services, and (2) sends the jobs X  requirements to Selecting Broker, then (3) optimal Grid services are selected based on AQoS and RQoS models and put them into a Services list. (4) Engine records the running information about the Grid Services invoked. Here, a manufac-turing grid as an instance is used to validate GS_AQoS model, the integrated job is shown in Fig.2, in which, a GS_AQoS named GS_MAQoS suitable for GS 2 is as a sample to do the simulation experiments. The experiment results can be extended to the multi-Grid Services in an integrated job yet, to evaluate the Integrated Perform-ance of job instances. 
Suppose there are 10 semantic equivalent Grid Services to GS 2 , and service pro-viders have provided GS_MAQoS information namely Price( P ), Quality( Q ), Re-sponding Time( T ) and Fidelity( F ), where, P and Q are provided by service provid-empty. Q is a given evaluation factor provided by service provider for the manufac-turing grid to describe the tolerance of the parts manufactured by GS 2 . In the sample lent Grid Services are all satisfying the function requirements of GS 2 , and based on their GS_MAQoS information we will do some tests, in which, suitable Grid Ser-vices are selected based on the evaluation modes provided in GS_AQoS and the average Price( P ), average Quality( Q ), average Responding Time( T ), average Fidelity( F ) and Integrated Performance( I ) of these selected Grid Services are recommended conclusions. First, the basic information of evaluation factors in GS_MAQoS will be simulated. 1 3. Simulation Information Quality. The basic information is simulated by means of the Responding Time and mation is shown in Table 1. 3. Testing Results F modes in GS_AQoS. In AQoS_value_range, the random approach is adopted to select while AQoS_relation_sort and AQoS_value_integration are to select suitable Grid Services on customers X  demand. In the experimentation, for simplification, RQoS( GS_Best )=Random( GS_Best ), namely one of Grid Services is selected at ran-dom from GS_Best. Their detail is given as following: GS_Q, GS_T and GS_F represent respectively the GS_Best with P emphasized, that with Q emphasized, that with T emphasized and that with F emphasized. Then, RQoS function is impacted on the Grid Services in GS_Best to select the best Grid Service. The processes of selecting Grid Services about the Price emphasized and the Quality emphasized are represented as following: 3 2 z Price emphasized: Let p = Min( P ), GS_ P ={ GS i | P i = p  X  GS i  X  GS_S }, then z Quality emphasized: Let Q = Min( Q ), GS_Q ={ GS same as those above and omitted due to space limit. 
According to the information obtained, p , Q , T , F of selected Grid Services are denoted as: = which is denoted as: Let GS_Best={ GS 1 , GS 2 ,..., GS 10 }, then Do While j &lt;100 { And then P , Q , T , F of selected Grid Services are calculated as the same as those in Testing1. AQoS_value_integration, and the factors with higher weights are more important than those with lower weights. The experiments are planed as following: z Weights of 0.7 , 0.1 , 0.1 , 0.1 are assigned to the factors of P , Q , T , F . z Weights of 0.6 , 0.2 , 0.1 , 0.1 are assigned to the factors of P , Q , T , F . z Weights of 0.5 , 0.2 , 0.2 , 0.1 are assigned to the factors of P , Q , T , F . z Weights of 0.4 , 0.2 , 0.2 , 0.2 are assigned to the factors of P , Q , T , F . z Average weights are assigned to these factors, namely all the weights are 0.25 . 
Based on these plans given above, corresponding space vector distances are calcu-the selected Grid Service are obtained, denoted as following: if D i =Max( D ) then P = P i , Q = Q i , T = T i , F = F i . At last, based on P , Q , T and F , then I is defined as: with higher values. 3. Testing Results and Analyzing Suppose the constraints of a requester for a Grid Service are: Q is lower than 0.25  X  m, the same as those simulated, then the 10 semantic equivalent Grid Services in Table 1 respectively, the weight of the factor emphasized is assigned to 0.7 , and others weights GS_AQoS, the cases of Grid Services selected are addressed as following: z In AQoS_relation_sort, firstly, Best_GS, namely GS_P , GS_Q , GS_T and GS_F , z In AQoS_value_range, Grid Services are selected at random, simply denoted z In AQoS_value_integration, vector similarity distance technology is used for of them are calculated, while, if more than one Grid Services are included in 4 RDM , which are shown in Table 3. 
To discuss further, the following measures are taken: z Let unique Grid Service be selected by using AQoS_relation_sort, then the re-z The weights in AQoS_value_integration are changed as following: (1) If average modes, which are shown in Fig.3. Where, AQoS_value_integration1 represents represents the AQoS_value_integration with average weights, coordinate x represents five groups of experiments, namely average Price, average Quality, average Responding Time, average Fidelity, and average Integrated Performance about Grid Services se-lected by using different evaluation modes, For example, group 1 represents the results group 2 represents the results of average Quality and so on. 
Based on these testing results above, it is obvious that GS_AQoS model is efficient and we can summarize the following suggestions. (1) AQoS_value_range is suitable for customers selecting Grid services at ra ndom. (2) AQoS_relation_sort is suitable if one factor is emphasized on customers X  demand. (3) AQoS_value_integration is suit-able for selecting Grid services with integrated performance, but average weights are suggested to embody the advantage of AQoS_ value_integration, otherwise, the con-Grid Services selected by AQoS_value_integration with average weights have the best performance. (5) AQoS_relation_sort and AQoS_value_range are simple to use but with some limitation for their applications, while AQoS_value_integration mode is flexible for its applications and with more advantages with it, such as the Grid Ser-vices selected with better integrated perfor mance can obtained easily on their demand. The AQoS Model for evaluating Grid Services is the need for selecting Grid services on customers X  X emand. In this paper, according to the characteristics of Grid Services, a common AQoS model (GS_QoS) is proposed, which is application-centric, and provides three types of flexible evaluation modes for customers X  selection. By simulation experiments, GS_AQoS model shows: z Not only common but also personality is represented in GS_AQoS model. z The common GS_AQoS XML schema as a common profile template is provided z It can raise the efficiency and utility of resources reservation since the number of z The quality of Grid Services described by two parts such as RQoS and AQoS 
In the next step, we will study the integration of RQoS and AQoS for Grid services and the QoS of jobs, as well as the coordination of resources in the execution of a job.
