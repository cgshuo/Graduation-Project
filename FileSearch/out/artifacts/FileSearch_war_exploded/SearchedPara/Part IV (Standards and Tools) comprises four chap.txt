Part IV (Standards and Tools) comprises four chapters. Chapter 12 presents standards for workflow def-inition and execution. This is achieved by presenting the leading standardization bodies and their goals, as well by presenting process definition languages as examples (e.g., XPDL, Wf-XML). Chapter 13 presents a more recent development: the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL). After a short intro-duction to Web services the authors demonstrate the rationale behind creating a new language for Web service processes. This is achieved by providing small examples as well as a brief introduction to the syntax of BPEL. Important concepts known from traditional workflows including fault handling, compensation, and death path elimination are discussed as well. Chapter 14 discusses a particular workflow management system X  X taff-ware (now part of TIBCO). This chapter (together with Chapter 15) is somewhat different from the rest of this book in the sense that it presents and discusses a particular product implementation. Chapter 15 presents FLOWer, a case-handling system. Before discussing the FLOWer system, the author also defines what is understood by the term case-handling and what the differences to traditional workflow systems are. Finally, the Appendix of this book provides a list of relevant additional resources, including books, web sites, stan-dardization initiatives, and some tools.

The editors achieve their goals stated in the Introduction. This book provides a unifying and comprehensive overview of the main topics of process-aware information systems. However, one should be aware that the field of process-aware information systems is rather large; hence, the depth and scope of a  X  X  X nified X  X  vision should be seen in perspective. This book provides an excellent start for students and researchers interested in this topic and wishing to pursue further research. What should be remarked as a positive feature as well is the fact that each chapter provides a set of exercises at the end of each chapter. The content of the book is timely and written by internationally well-known experts in the field. The chapters are edited carefully and are well-written and easy to follow. One drawback of this book, however, is its price (some $99), which might be challenging as a student textbook.

Humans are forever social. We humans live in social environments and behave socially. We treat everything in our environment, including other humans and even artifacts, socially. Consequently, computers and other technologies should be continuously regarded as social actors. This means that designers are challenged to de-velop more socially demanding interfaces for today X  X  technologies. Yet how much do we understand about ourselves as social beings, especially when we interact with technologies? In addition, how can our understand-ings help in designing and using socially friendly technologies? Nass and Brave X  X  new book, Wired for Speech: How Voice Activates and Advances the Human X  X omputer Relationship , is the first of its kind to address the social aspect of human X  X echnology interaction via one of the most social cues: speech. They assert that the psychology of interface speech is the psychology of human speech.

Chapters 2 X 14 cover a variety of topics that were addressed by 20 experiments with thou-sands of participants over a period of a decade. These topics on human X  X omputer speech interaction include gender (Chapters 2 and 3), personality (Chapters 4 and 5), accents, race and ethnicity (Chapter 6), emotion (Chapters 7 and 8), social (in)consistency induced by a mix of factors (Chapters 9 X 12), communication con-texts (Chapter 13), and misrecognition (Chapter 14).

 puter interaction, sociology, social psychology, communication, information systems, and organizational behavior. In fact, it will strike a chord with anyone interested in research, management, and practice of the social aspect of human X  X echnology interaction. First, it is rooted in existing theories but does not stop there.
The authors are well aware of the limitations of relying too heavily on the existing theories to explain and pre-dict speech interaction with computers, a new phenomenon for these theories. Scientific inquiry is often chal-lenged by the need to address new applications with seemingly old theories and principles. Second, the authors conducted these studies based on a broad literature that crosses many different disciplines, demonstrating the truly inter-and multi-disciplinary nature of human X  X echnology interaction. It is refreshing to see how the authors masterfully pull all relevant work together to explore the phenomenon that interests them. Third, the many research questions and empirical findings reported in the book paint a rather comprehensive picture of the phenomenon of speech interaction with computers. Such a comprehensive understanding can only be achieved with a long-term research agenda and rigorous research designs and implementations. Thus, the findings as a whole add significantly to the literature, providing a solid base for future research. It is hard to imagine that the book will not be cited heavily in future studies that are related to the social side of human X  X echnology interaction. Finally, the authors explicitly point out the implications of the studies, thus addressing the  X  X  X o what X  X  question for designers, managers or stakeholders, and regular users of technology design, management and use.
 not necessarily research oriented. Although the book is deeply rooted in theory and research in the literature, readers will not find jargon or intense abstract discussion. The authors study instances in daily life, and exam-ples that most of us can identify with. They describe their studies in a language that people without specific domain knowledge can understand. The text is full of witty observations, insightful explanations, and fun examples.
 is congruent with mine that we should constantly return to human fundamentals: instead of blaming the limitations of technologies, we should ask ourselves how much we really know about ourselves as humans.

The following three quotations summarize the major points of the book. Therefore, I will organize the review around these three statements. When I first read this statement, I recalled Michael Lesk X  X  statement in Digital Libraries: Books, Bytes, and Bucks (Lesk, 1997) that textual search as a problem is nearly solved [p. 2]. It highlights, for me, (1) the dis-connect that so often exists between academics and practitioners and (2) how difficult it is to predict where a field or technology is going. Lesk X  X  comment comes before the massive increase of content on Web, the reli-ance on Web search engines in everyday information seeking, the increase in Web spam content to deceive search engines, and the growth of paid search as a business model for online commerce.

Battelle does a good job of supporting Manabar X  X  position by outlining various issues including technical, social, linguistically, and commercial that Web search faces today. Surprisingly to me, some of the technical issues were the most interesting. For example, the author comments that Google has more computers (approxi-mately, 175,000) servicing its search index than existed in the entire world in the 70s. Battelle touches on issues familiar to most researchers in the field, including the effect of stop words, term matching, and meta-data, along with some more uncommon ones including paid search and spam. In the social area, Battelle uses a  X  X  X atabase of Intentions X  X  metaphor to describe the possible uses of and knowledge from the massive amount of search data that Google, Yahoo!, and the other major search engines have concerning the desires, issues, and interests of millions of searchers. He addresses the implicit trust be-tween searchers and search engines and the increasing strain that exists (or will exist) between this  X  X  X mplicit trust X  X  and the pressures from government and others to use this information for a variety of purposes, espe-cially national security. The author does an excellent job of highlighting the simultaneous and ongoing changes in technology, information and people that has brought us to the point where this is a concern. In fact, the databases are already being used for purposes other than improving search (c.f., Ettredge, Gerdes, &amp; Karuga, 2005; Jansen, Jansen, &amp; Spink, 2005).

The tension between protecting this  X  X  X mplicit trust X  X  of searchers and utilizing the information contained within for other purposes raises many concerns and difficult situations. There may not be a right answer for all situations. For example, take national security. Certainly, it seems reasonable that one expects a degree of privacy when using a search engine. However, I then picture in my mind the image from 9/11, of the Towers
