 We describe results from Web search log studies aim ed at elucidating user behaviors associated with queries and destination URLs that appear with different frequencies. We no te the diversity of information goals that searchers have and the differing ways that goals are specified. We exami ne rare and common information goals that are specified using r are or common queries. We identify several significant d ifferences in user behavior depending on the rarity of the query and the destination URL. We find that searchers are more likely to be successful when the frequencies of the query and de stination URL are similar. We also establish that the behaviora l differences observed for queries and goals of varying rarity pe rsist even after accounting for potential confounding variables, inc luding query length, search engine ranking, session duration, an d task difficulty. Finally, using an information-theoreti c measure of search difficulty, we show that the benefits obtain ed by search and navigation actions depend on the frequency of the i nformation goal.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Search process, Query formulation Experimentation, Human Factors. Measurement Web search, Information goal, User behavior When searching the Web, users typically issue a que ry to a search engine, are presented with a list of results, and t hen may click on one or more results in an attempt to satisfy an inf ormation goal. Along the way, the searcher may modify their initia l query in various ways [14][16]. People have mixed experienc es with this process: search engines do a great job of returning relevant results for some queries and a poor job for others. Althou gh there has been a good deal of work characterizing the heavy-t ailed Zipf distribution of both queries and target URLs [18][2 4], there has been much less work on understanding searchers X  exp eriences and behaviors associated with these characteristics. D o search engines and searchers behave differently on rare queries th an on common ones? Do rare queries represent rare informational goals, or simply atypical means of specifying common goals? H ow can answers to such questions guide research toward enh ancing Web search experiences? Search queries are the articulation of a person X  X  i nformation goals. People employ a mixture of search and navigation st rategies to satisfy these goals. In laboratory studies, partic ipants can be given known search goals or probed about their own information goals. In large-scale log studies, information goa ls must be inferred from patterns of user interactions. One a pproach to inferring searchers X  information goals is to consid er the patterns of pages viewed in sessions as well as the dwell ti mes on pages as implicit indicators of interest [1][8][26][29]. Fo r example, a researcher may start a session by searching for a a nother researcher by name, select a link to that colleague  X  X  home page from the results, navigate from the home page to a list of publications, and finally click a link to the paper which satisfies the intent of the search. In this paper, we shall take the last URL visited in a search session as a candidate proxy fo r a searcher X  X  underlying information goal. Using such a proxy, fo r users X  goals, we can identify relationships between queries and g oals that are consistent across many users and diverse search tas ks. We seek to understand the relationship between the articulation of a goal (as represented by the search query) and the actual information goal (as represented by URLs visited in a session). We investigate how search behavior varies across ra re and common queries, in the face of rare and common info rmation goals. We present results from a large-scale log s tudy of search sessions from users of major Web search engines. After a discussion of previous work, we describe th e data collection and session extraction methodology in de tail. We then present experimental results describing user behavi ors for sessions consisting of queries and target URLs of different frequencies. In some cases, we provide empirical confirmation of re lationships one might expect to hold between goals and queries; in other cases, the findings are more surprising. Our key r esults include: After establishing the results above, we proceed to examine potential confounding variables in the analysis. A number of different variables are known to correlate with use r behavior as well as with the rarity of queries and information goals. We find that goal rarity appears to be the paramount influe nce in our findings, based on an investigation of a variety of variables including query length, search engine ranking, sess ion length, and task difficulty. Lastly, we discuss results showing that users often compensate successfully for decreased search engine effectiven ess on rare queries by issuing more general queries, and then f ollowing hyperlinks to satisfy their need. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results for efforts toward enhancing Web search. Analyses of user behavior in a search engine contex t rely on a variety of methods including: user studies [2][11][ 21], offline query log analysis [13][16][24][25], and deeper ins trumentation of session behavior using browser toolbar plug-ins [6] [7][28][29]. User studies provide a detailed understanding of th e behaviors and intentions of individuals. Toolbar data, on the oth er hand, provide a rich source of information about interaction patt erns for a wide range of different users and tasks. Grimes et al. [ 10] describe the complementary relations among these different sourc es of information about user search behavior. In this paper, we focus on large-scale analyses of logs data voluntarily shared by users via a browser toolbar, aimed at understanding both the diversity of information goa ls that searchers have and the queries they use to express those goals. The information science literature provides several frameworks for understanding information seeking behaviors and processes [3][12][19]. People often begin an information-seek ing episode with an  X  X nomalous state of knowledge X  (ASK) and se ek information that will resolve the knowledge gap. T he information seeking process involves a person translating their information need into a query, receiving a ranked list of results, and exploring the results via navigation among the results. If th e initial search results do not satisfy the user X  X  information need, the user may reformulate his or her query. Formulating and refo rmulating queries can be a challenging problem because the in formation goal may be unclear ( i.e., the user has uncertainty about the need), the user may introduce semantic or syntactic errors into the query, or the need may be unsatisfiable with the current r esources [22]. Studies of how searchers modify their queries over the course of a session show that specialization of the query occur s more frequently than generalization [15], and that speci alized queries tend to be longer [16]. Longer queries are more li kely to be less frequent, so users often progress from frequent to rarer queries during a search session. In the context of the Web, Broder [4] and Rose and Levinson [23] described three classes of user goals in search: in formational, navigational, and resource or transactional. Lee et al. [17] used the distribution of clicks in search engine results and properties of the anchor text content to automatically identify navig ational queries. Chang et al. [5] used analyses of clicked results X  snippets to classify search queries as navigational or informat ional. Informational goals are similar to topical queries in the information retrieval literature. Navigational and transactional searches are more specific to the Web in which the user X  X  goal is to find a Web site or to perform some Web-mediated activity. Navigational searches are particularly interesting because they illustrate the distinction between the articulation of a user X  X  goal (the query) and the user X  X  underlying information g oal. A query like kelly blue book is classified as a navigational query since it  X  X emonstrates a desire by the user to be taken to t he home page of the institution or organization in question X  [4]. However, many searchers will navigate from this home page to othe r pages in this or other sites ( e.g., to look up the value of a particular used car; to post a car for sale; or to read reviews and ratings ). These subsequent actions may be better characterizations of the searcher X  X  information goal than their original que ry. Teevan et al. [26] and White and colleagues [28][29] have als o noted that searches are just the starting point for richer inf ormation interactions that evolve over the course of a sessi on. In the work reported here, we examine several ways of character izing the information goal in a session. Although there has been much written about the long tail of queries, less is known about the quality of search results and user interactions following the issuing of rare queries. Downey, Dumais, and Horvitz explored user behaviors associa ted with rare and common queries [6]. They found that users were more likely to click a result for common queries and conversely that they were more likely to reformulate rare queries. We extend this prior work on rare and common queries in several directions. We examine user behavior for both queries and target URLs that vary in frequency using much finer distinctions. We also e xamine how the correspondence between the expression of the go al (queries) and the target goal (last URL visited) influences u ser success. We obtained fully-anonymized logs of URLs visited b y users who opted in to provide data through a widely distribut ed browser toolbar. Each entry in the raw data consists of a unique machine identifier, a timestamp, the URL visited, and the U RL X  X  referrer (if any). Intranet and secure (https) URL visits a re excluded at the source. In order to remove variability caused by g eographic and linguistic variation in search behavior, we include only entries generated in the English speaking United States ISO locale. The results described in this paper are based on a samp le of two weeks X  worth of URL visits during June, 2006, repre senting more than 80 million URL visits from more than 206,000 u nique users. As is the case with many large-scale log analyses, if more than one person uses the same computer, they will have t he same machine ID. However, we believe that it is reasonab le to assume that a single session (defined below) represents th e actions of a single user. Thus, we refer to a toolbar instance a s a user. From the stream of URLs, we extracted queries issue d to major Web search engines. We used HTTP referrer informat ion to deduce whether a URL that followed a search was fro m a click on a results page or not. To create a user session, we ordered each user X  X  ac tivities by time. Each session begins with a search query and ends ac cording to a subset of the criteria used by White and Drucker [2 8]. Specifically, we used 30 minutes of inactivity, a v isit to the user X  X  home page, or a login to a secured site (including mail, myspace and del.icio.us) to identify session boundaries. We used the page that appeared most commonly after a new browser win dow as a heuristic for identifying a person X  X  homepage. We a lso experimented with defining session endpoints using just 30 minutes of inactivity. A manual inspection of seve ral hundred queries found that the final URLs observed using th e White and Drucker heuristics were generally more relevant to the search query that initiated the session than using a timeo ut heuristic alone. Because we were interested in understanding searcher X  X  information goals, we only considered sessions that contained at least one click on a search engine result and that also ended with a visit to a Web page. Using this definition, we exam ined over 523,000 sessions from more than 105,000 unique user s. Table 1 shows a sample session. The acronym SERP r efers to the  X  X earch engine result page, X  thus a SERP Click is a click on one of the search engine results. The searcher begins a t time t querying for peanut butter . They then click on a Wikipedia link presented on the results page. Once on Wikipedia, they navigate to a related topic. Shortly afterward they issue a nother query, but misspell the word recipes . Their next query corrects this typo, and they then click on two links on the result page . At t navigates to another page on the same site as the p revious result click. From this example, we may infer that the us er was looking for peanut butter sandwich recipes. From the session data we explore the relationship b etween a query and the action immediately following the query. We use the relative frequency of these actions as a way to cha racterize the quality of the results for the query. The actions of interest are:  X  SERP Click  X  a click on the result page.  X  Requery  X  a query reformulation.  X  URL Visit  X  a visit to a Web page that is not a SERP Click In Table 1, the post-query actions of interest are marked with daggers (  X  )  X  a SERP click at t 1 , a Requery at t 4 at t 5 . Figure 1 shows examples of the types of events co nsidered in the processed data. We also explored how query behavior changes with re spect to the rarity of information goal, as represented by the l ast URLs explored by the searcher. A user X  X  search query is the expression of their information goal. However, this may not c orrespond to the user X  X  actual information goal. Without conduct ing detailed interviews with searchers it is difficult to know p recisely what they were searching for and whether they were satis fied with the results. We attempted to infer the nature of the u ser X  X  information goal by examining the URLs that they visited near t he end of the session. Others have looked at richer models of s earch interactions to evaluate the relevance of individua l search results to the query [1][8]. Our interest is primarily in c haracterizing the information goals of searchers, and being able to d o so on a very large scale to understand the wide variety of searc her X  X  goals. We examine properties of URLs near the end of a sessio n to do this. White et al. used a related notion of search destin ations in their work [29] and showed how interactive search could b e improved by suggesting common destinations for issued querie s. We use similar ideas to characterize information needs. We examined both the last SERP click in a session a nd the last URL in a session (which could be either a SERP clic k or a subsequent navigation) as proxies for the informati on goal. The last URL visited in a session has been used in prior research as a proxy for the user X  X  intended destination [29]. As suming that the last URL satisfies the goal of a given query is a s implification for several reasons: the goal may not have been satisfi ed; other pages in the session may have been necessary or sufficien t to fulfill the goal; or (because detection of session boundaries i s imperfect) the last URL may have been directed at a new goal. Non etheless, the last URL visited is a reasonable proxy for the user  X  X  goal and, though approximate, such a definition is amenable t o large-scale data analysis. We additionally consider the last SERP click as a proxy. The last SERP click has the disadvantage of being restricted to the options that current search engines make available, and it ignores subsequent navigation. However, in manual inspecti on of user interactions we found that the last SERP click was sometimes more closely related to the query than the last URL , which is not surprising if search engines are doing a good job o f ranking results. The SERP click also has the advantage of being available to search engines ( i.e ., it does not require the client-side instrumentation we employ in this paper). Further, by comparing behavior across the two proxies, we can isolate the effects of pos t-SERP navigation (see Section 6). One potential concern about using SERP clicks as a surrogate for information need is that users of tabbed browsers m ay load several SERP results into different tabs without ac tually reading them. We examined how often multiple URL loads occ urred within one second of each other and found that this occurred in only 1.4% of the sessions. So we do not believe th at this is a serious concern with the data used in our studies. In summary, we examine two complementary methods fo r characterizing the user X  X  information need, which w e believe provide a rich picture of interactions with search engine results and subsequent navigation patterns. The two method s we use to characterize information goals are: In the session illustrated in Table 1, the last SER P click in the session is shown at t 6 , and the last URL visit in the session is shown at t 7 . Search queries and URL accesses are known to follow a heavy-tailed Zipf distribution [24][25]. In the head of t he distribution, a small number of queries and URLs are observed very frequently. However, there are many more queries and URLs in th e tail that are observed much less frequently. We classified e ach query and URL in a session as tail or non-tail , and also considered finer-grained classifications of frequencies of occurrenc e. We start with a methodology similar to that propose d by Downey et al. [6] to measure the frequency of occurrence. We use the first week of data to cumulate information about the freq uency of queries and URLs, and the second week of data to me asure user interaction patterns. This definition allows the r esults of these analyses to be applied in an online, sliding-window fashion. Query frequencies are obtained by counting the queries issued to major search engines. This is different than using corpus statistics to characterize the frequency of terms in queries. Since we are interested in searcher behavior and have access to query logs, the definition that focuses on searchers (and not autho rs) is preferable. URL access frequencies are obtained by counting Web page visits, regardless of whether these visits are in response to a query or not. We do so because we are interesting in understand c ommon goals, and not just destinations that are easily accessibl e using search engines. To allow for comparison with earlier work by Downey et at. [6], we define the tail to contain queries or URLs observed in the second week of data that were not observed duri ng the first week, and all other queries or URLs are non-tail . We also analyze finer-grained frequency bins using the frequency ob served during the first week. We now focus on our primary experimental results sh owing differences in the behavior of searchers with chang es in the rarity of queries or goals. We start by examining user be havior following individual queries, and then broaden the analysis to consider sessions of multiple queries. We begin by examining whether searchers behave diff erently following rare and common queries. For each query in the session, we summarize the proportion of times that the next action is another query, a SERP click, or a URL visit. Si nce all of our sessions end in either a SERP click or a URL visit, we do not consider sessions that contain only unclicked queri es. Table 2 shows the distribution of post-query events broken down by the rarity of the query. Following tail queries , SERP clicks are less common (0.579 vs. 0.725) and requeries are mor e common (0.357 vs. 0.207), both of which indicate that the results returned by the search engine were not as useful to searcher s. Z-tests for differences in proportions verify that these differ ences are statistically reliable. For these and all other pr oportions presented in the text, the results are significant at the .01 level, unless otherwise noted. This trend also holds when we consider post-query a ctions within finer-grained frequency bins. Figure 2 shows the p roportion of post-query actions as a function of finer-grained q uery frequency. As in the previous analysis,  X  X ail X  queries are def ined as those that did not occur during the first week. The other fre quencies are logarithmically binned. That is, queries that occu r 1 to 9 times are in the first bin, those occurring 10-99 times in th e next bin, etc. Figure 2 shows that SERP clicks increase and requer ies decrease smoothly as the frequency of queries increases. These results agree qualitatively with and extend t he results reported by Downey et al. [6], and suggest that sea rch engines are not doing as good a job of satisfying searchers for rarer queries as they do on more common ones. We now consider the influence of the rarity of the information goal. As described above, we examined two heuristi cs for characterizing searchers X  information goals: one wh ich uses the last SERP click in the session (Last SERP Click), a nd the other which uses the last URL in the session, which could be a SERP click or a subsequent navigation (Last URL Visit). Results for both are shown in the following tables. Table 3 shows the effect of information goal rarity on post-query behavior. Using the last SERP click as the proxy f or information goal, we observe behavior very similar to that show n in Table 2; SERP clicks are less likely for tail goals (0.590 v s. 0.667), and users are more likely to requery for tail goals (0. 343 vs. 0.270). When we use the last URL visit as the proxy for inf ormational goal, the pattern is similar but not as strong. Us ers are somewhat less likely to click (0.616 vs. 0.630) and more lik ely to requery for tail goals (0.324 vs. 0.296). There is also a smal l increase in URL visits following a query for non-tail URLs (0.074 v s. 0.060). These visits can come from a wide variety of source s ( e.g., typing directly into the address bar, navigating to bookma rks, etc.) and are difficult to interpret without more detailed an alysis of the URLs. Table 3. Post-query action by information goal freq uency Info.Goal Last URL SERP Click URL Visit These trends are also evident when we consider post -query actions with finer-grained bins. Figures 3a and 3b show the proportion of post-query actions as a function of l ogarithmic frequency bins. Figure 3a shows the data when SERP Clicks are used to define user goals, and Figure 3b shows the same data for URL Visits. The reasons why post-query actions are less dependent on URL frequency in Figure 3b is not clea r. In examining search sessions by hand, we have sometime s seen that the last URL visited in a session is unrelated to t he query (particularly when the last URL is common), so this proxy for informational goals may be noisier. When using SERP clicks to characterize goals, however, we see very clearly th at search engines perform less well at satisfying searchers f or rarer information goals. Figure 3a. Post-query action by last SERP click fre quency bins Figure 3b. Post-query action by last URL visit freq uency bins We have demonstrated that the distribution of post-query actions changes depending on the rarity of the query and in formation goal in isolation. We now examine the joint influences of rarity of query and information goal on search sessions. Thi s combination allows us to examine the relationship between query articulation and the underlying information goal (as represented by destination URLs). Such analyses highlight the rich interaction s and potential dependencies among the expression of goals and the goals themselves; searchers may formulate rare or common queries for rare goals X  X r common goals. By using the prior defi nitions of rare versus common queries and goals, we have four outcomes. Table 4 summarizes the results of studies of these four situations. We observe that users are more likely to click a se arch result when the query and information goal are of similar frequencies. For tail queries, a SERP click is more likely when the information goal is also rare (0.583 vs. 0.570 for SERP Clicks and 0.589 vs. 0.560 for URL Visits). Likewise, results from comm on queries are clicked more for common information goals (0.77 1 vs. 0.627 for SERP Clicks and 0.741 vs. 0.706 for URL Visits) . A similar pattern is observed for requeries, with queries bei ng modified more when the query and URL frequencies do not agre e. This suggests that search engines do a better job of ide ntifying relevant results when the user X  X  communication of their goal (the query) matches the frequency of their information goal (th e URL). Table 4. Post-query action by query and URL frequen cy Info.
 Goal To further explore the alignment effect, we binned queries and URLs by their frequencies, again using logarithmic bins. Tables 5a and 5b show the SERP click probability for diffe rent frequency bins for queries (rows) and last URL (columns). The maximum of each column is shown in boldface type. We observe t hat the probability of a SERP click is maximized approximat ely across the diagonal. For each query frequency, SERP click s are most frequent when the query and information goal match. We share several examples to help clarify the significance o f this alignment. Consider a query like webmd , which is fairly common. Our log data shows that the most frequently clicked URL is also common: http://www.webmd.com . If searchers had the same information goal but described it in a less common way they wou ld be less successful. Spelling errors ( e.g., webmb) are an example of low frequency queries, and would require at least anoth er click (on a query suggestion) or an explicit query reformulatio n to achieve success. Similarly, a query like medical questions page would not be the ideal way to get to the WebMD home page, alt hough it may be all that a particular searcher can articulate ab out their goal. Low frequency information goals, on the other hand, tend to be satisfied best by low frequency queries. For exampl e, if a searcher wants to get to an uncommon URL like http://www.dc.state.fl.us, the query florida department of corrections is a good way to get there. Conversely, a higher frequency query like prisons would be less successful and require more iteration to satis fy this information goal. An important caveat to the alignment effect is that more common queries tend to be more effective than less common queries, regardless of goal rarity. This is shown to a small extent in Table 5a, and to a larger extent in Table 5b. In Table 5 b the best performance for any row is obtained for common quer ies. We postulate that this effect results from users issui ng more general queries than their specific need, and then  X  X rillin g-down X  to satisfy their actual goal (commonly by using subseq uent navigation beyond the SERP click, but occasionally by browsing deeper into search results). We investigate this p henomenon in more detail in Section 6. To summarize, we have shown that searchers are more successful for common queries and common goals. We have also shown that regardless of query or goal frequency the best sear ch success occurs when the relative frequency of the query matches that of the information goal. Last SERP Click Frequency Last URL Visit Frequency So far we have used the actions that follow queries to characterize search success, and shown that search engines perfo rm more poorly on tail queries and URLs as measured by SERP clicks and requeries. We now examine in more detail how searc hers move from initial queries to final URLs during the cours e of a search session. Another measure of search engine performance is the number of queries a user issues during a session. We assume that the better a search engine is at satisfying the user X  X  goal, the fewer queries will be required. For these analyses, we considere d sessions that contained between 2 and 20 queries. Figure 4 shows the average number of queries in a session as a function of the frequency of the last SERP click. As the information goal becom es more common, the average number of queries in a session decreases from more than 4 queries to less than 2 queries. Ideally, with each successive search in a session, users should come closer to fulfilling their information goal. We examine this by comparing the extent to which the frequencies of the first and last queries are aligned with the information goal. At the end of a search session, we expect that the frequency of the query should be closer to the frequency of the information goal than it was at the start of the session. Table 6 shows the propor tion of sessions in which the frequency of the query (tail, non-tail ) agrees with the frequency of the information need (tail, non-tail), for the first and last query in a session. The frequencies align 72. 5% of the time for the last query compared with 66.5% for the firs t query. This trend holds for both tail and non-tail information goals. The lower overall level of agreement for tail URLs suggests t hat users may click on more popular results than their informatio n need would suggest. However, it is important to note that the frequency of URLs in SERPs is influenced by the ranking provided by search engines, which may include a bias toward more commo n URLs. The decreased search efficacy for rarer information goals is confirmed by the number of queries in a session. A nd, the alignment of query and URL frequencies is further s upported by looking at changes in agreement during the course o f a session. A number of different variables that are known to c orrelate with Web search behavior (e.g., the number of terms in a query, or the number of queries issued so far in a session) also correlate with query and goal rarity. An important question, ther efore, is whether the behavioral variation presented above is captured equally well by these other variables, independent of query and goal rarity. In this section, we examine four such potential confounding variables, and find that rarity still r emains a significant factor in explaining user behavior even after accounting for the other variables. Phan et al. [21] have shown that query length is as sociated with the specificity of a user X  X  information goal and fo und that longer queries were generally associated with more specifi c information goals. Prior work has also shown that longer queri es tend to occur less frequently [13]. Thus, the differences that w e have observed in the distribution of actions following a query ma y reflect how search engines respond to queries of different leng ths rather than to queries of different frequencies. In this secti on, we present experiments that show this conjecture to be false  X  query rarity in fact has a more significant effect on behavior than does query length. We examined post-query actions as a function of num ber of words in each query. Figure 5 shows the proportion of po st-query actions that are requeries as a function of query f requency (top panel) and query length (bottom panel). The top gr aph shows that the probability of a requery drops (from almost 50% to less than 20%) as query frequency increases from the tail to 100+ occurrences. But this effect is very similar for q ueries of different lengths. The bottom graph shows that the probabili ty of a requery is fairly flat as the number of words in the query increases, but varies substantially as query frequency changes. S imilar results are observed for SERP clicks as well, but are not s hown. Thus, the differences in distribution of actions followin g a query that we observed appear to be related to query frequency ra ther than query length. 
Figure 5. Proportion of post-query query actions th at are It is worth noting that much research in informatio n retrieval shows that query length is positively correlated wi th search engine effectiveness for TREC-style ad hoc queries and rel evance feedback experiments [27] and for interactive user studies [2]. Most experimental IR systems use probabilistic best -match techniques in which combining more terms in a weigh ted fashion leads to improved retrieval. In contrast, Web sear ch engines use exact-match techniques in which all query words mus t match a Web page (in combination with a large number of oth er factors) for ranking. In Web search, we find that longer que ries are not as successful as shorter queries. We believe that the differences between phenomena observed in traditional informati on retrieval and Web search arise because of the nature of the u nderling matching techniques. In addition, we found that th e query frequency is more important than query length, indi cating perhaps that Web search engines are optimized to handle com mon requests. Tables 5a and 5b show that queries are more success ful when their frequency matches that of the underlying goal . One candidate explanation for this finding is that sear ch engines return results with frequencies matching that of the query . If so, then searchers will have few options but to choose SERP URLs that match the query in frequency. Here, we investigate whether the alignment observed in Tables 5a and 5b is simply du e to the mix of result frequencies that search engines present. Table 7 lists the fraction of presented SERP URLs t hat were clicked, for varying query and SERP URL frequencies . That is, for each cell, we report the proportion of presente d URLs that were clicked. If the alignment in Tables 5a and 5b were due only to the mix of result frequencies presented by searc h engines, we would expect all values for each row in Table 7 to be the same independent of query frequency. On the contrary, t he table illustrates that a result is more likely to be clic ked, per presentation, when its frequency matches the query frequency. Thus, we have shown that the alignment in Tables 5a and 5b is not simply an artifact of search engine ranking, as it persists after accounting for how frequently results are presented . Table 7. Ratio of the number of clicked result URL s to the number of presented result URLs at varying query an d URL frequencies. (The row maximum is shown in bold.) URL Frequency In Section 4.4, we showed that as information goals become rarer, search sessions become longer. Previous results ha ve shown that as additional queries are issued in a session, the likelihood of success on a query decreases [7]. Thus, one candid ate explanation for the relatively lower success rate on queries fo r tail goals is simply that these queries tend to occur later in a search session, where success is less likely. In this section, we present experiments showing that this explanation is incorr ect  X  in fact, the substantial differences in user behavior due to goal rarity occur only at the beginning of sessions. We measured how a searcher X  X  probability of success varies with the number of queries issued previously in a sessio n. For this analysis we define a search to be successful if the user clicks on a SERP result and does not issue another query in the session. Figure 6 also shows the probability of success as a function of number of queries executed so far in the session. As additional queries are issued, each subsequent query has a low er probability of success. This result is intuitive: if an inform ation goal has already required several queries, that goal is chal lenging and thus unlikely to be satisfied by a single additional que ry. The figure shows that success on the initial queries depends heavily on the frequency of the last SERP URL. On the first query, searchers are 2.5 times more likely to succe ed for common URLs (0.64 vs. 0.27). However, this difference dis appears as session length increases, suggesting that long sess ions tend to involve difficult information goals, regardless of the frequency of the last SERP URL. Thus, we have shown that the di fference in user behavior observed for queries aimed at goals o f varying rarity (Table 3) is not simply a consequence of the point in the session at which those queries were executed. In Section 4.4 we showed that the number of queries required to achieve a user X  X  information goal increases as the goal becomes rarer. But is this increase in user effort simply due to the increased difficulty involved in finding a more obs cure target page, or is it instead due to ineffectiveness of se arch engines in handling rare queries? We address this question with an information-theore tic analysis aimed at characterizing the difficulty of achieving the information goal [20]. Specifically, we define the difficulty of the search task as the expected number of bits of information requi red to identify the URL satisfying the goal, assuming an optimal co de. Thus we characterize the difficulty of a search task as fol lows: where P ( Goal URL ) is the frequency of the URL satisfying the user X  X  goal, expressed as a probability. Using this definition, difficult tasks are those whose goals are rare. The Goal URL can either be a SERP Click or URL Visit, as described i n Section 3.2.3. In these experiments, to produce probabiliti es we smooth the frequencies of the goal URLs using Good-Turing estimation [9]. We also define the average information gain of a query as the task difficulty divided by the number of querie s in the session, and we define the average information gain of a URL visit similarly. In Figure 7 we show how the average information gai n of a query action varies with the rarity of the user X  X  informa tion goal. The curves show how information gain per query varies w ith goal rarity for our two methods of characterizing inform ation goals. Using the last SERP Click as the user X  X  goal, we fi nd that queries are most effective for finding SERP URLs that are n either too common nor too rare, with a peak at a frequency bet ween 100 and 999 visits in our data set (corresponding to a prob ability between 1.2*10 -6 and 1.2*10 -5 ). The average information gain at the peak is about 50% higher than at either the rare or comm on extreme. The downward trend in information gain (for both cu rves) as needs become rare suggests that search engines are, in fact, less effective at returning URLs that satisfy rare goals , even after accounting for the difficulty of the goal. We desc ribe the differences between the curves in more detail in th e next section. One strategy users employ in Web search is to execu te a more general query than their need, and then after click ing a SERP result navigate via hyperlinks to find a page that satisfies their goal [26][29]. In this section, we show that the r esults presented in Section 4.3 which suggested that this strategy i s a particularly effective approach for rare goals, are confirmed us ing the information-theoretic analysis of search strategies described in the previous section. Tables 5a and Table 5b summarize the frequency alig nment result in which the best performance (for each column) is observed when the frequencies of the query and goal URL are similar. There are, however, some interesting differences be tween the tables. In Table 5b, the success rate is highest fo r more common queries independent of the goal rarity. That is, f or all rows, the best performance is observed for the most frequent queries (right column). In Table 5a, this pattern is less consist ent. Thus, when achieving the search goal using just SERP URLs (Tab le 5a), common queries are not uniformly the most effective . However, when the user can use navigation beyond the SERP to achieve this search goal (Table 5b), more common queries are mor e effective than rare queries independent of the goal rarity. In fact, using a more common query improves effectiveness by an aver age of 9% if subsequent navigation is employed (Table 5b), ve rsus only 2% if not (Table 5a). This suggests that users can ac hieve greater success in search if they utilize more general quer ies than their goal, and navigate to their goal page. We confirm these findings using the information-the oretic analysis described in the previous section. Figure 7 shows how information gain per query varies when we use the l ast URL Visit and the last SERP URL to represent the goal of the session. The differences between the two curves show that additional navigation actions that occur in the URL Visit curv e can increase the information gain per query for rare goals (thos e with frequencies less than 10), while decreasing the gai n for common goals. Thus, the strategy of clicking a relatively general SERP URL and then navigating to a more specific goal pag e allows a user to increase the information they gain from eac h query in a session. Of course, for this strategy to be effective, the n umber of navigations needed to obtain the goal must not be t oo large. How many URL Visits does the user have to execute in or der to get the benefits for rare goals shown in Figure 7? On aver age, we found that a query provided about six times as much infor mation gain as a URL Visit. However, queries and URL Visits have distinct patterns of effectiveness for goals of different fr equencies. The average number of queries executed in a session inc reases substantially as goals become rarer, whereas the nu mber of URL Visits stays relatively constant. The relative eff ectiveness of the two actions also varies with the length of the sear ch session, as shown in Figure 8. In the figure, the information gain due to a single query (1 Query) is compared with ten times t he information gain of a navigation action (10 URL Visits). Queri es are especially informative for one-query sessions (that is, cases in which only a single query is required to satisfy th e information goal, such as navigational queries), but queries de crease in effectiveness more rapidly than URL Visits as sessi on length increases. The information-theoretic measure of search difficu lty quantifies the challenge inherent in search tasks and makes pr ecise the rate at which queries and URL visits yield information r egarding the target goal. Queries are most informative for goal s which are neither too rare nor too common. For rare goals, the strategy of starting with a general query and navigating to mor e specific URLs is the most effective. It is well known that search queries and URL access es follow a heavy-tailed distribution, but less has been known about how the wildly varying commonality of queries and informati on goals influences user behavior or the performance of sear ch engines. We presented the first large-scale log analyses tha t characterize the distribution of rare queries and goals in Web s earch. We also examined the influence of the rarity versus commona lity of queries and goals on user interactions with today X  X  search engines. Our analyses uncovered significant differences in u ser behavior for rare and common queries and URLs. Several meas ures of user interaction (results clicks, query reformulations a nd session length) indicate that search engines are doing a be tter job at satisfying common information goals. We also estab lished that important differences exist between the expression of an information goal (as measured by the query) and the underlying goal itself (as measured by the last URLs visited i n a search session). The best search success occurs when the re is an alignment between the frequency of goals and expres sion of those goals. We also validated our results by probing a set of p otential confounding variables--including query length, sear ch engine ranking, session duration, and task difficulty X  X nd found that the differences in user behavior due to the rarity of q ueries and goals persist after accounting for these other variables. Lastly, using an information-theoretic analysis of user actions duri ng a search sessions, we showed that clicking a general result and then navigating to more specific destination URLs can be an effective strategy for satisfying rare information goals. Incorporating methods and machinery for addressing the long tail of rare queries promises to enhance Web search. Our findings on the link between the commonality of queries and goa ls and interactions with search engines are descriptive of searcher X  X  behaviors with existing Web search engines. Neverth eless, we believe that the observations have implications for how to better support searchers using existing systems, and how t o design new systems that will more effectively satisfy user X  X  i nformation needs. The alignment results, suggest that search engines might perform better if rankings took into consideration the query frequency. For example, results with similar frequ encies to the query might be boosted in the ranking (i.e., common URLs could be ranked higher for common queries, and rarer URLs ranked higher for rare queries). This could be especially important for rare information goals, where search success is low er. Identifying rare goals in real-time is challenging technically, but could be accomplished by analyzing the patterns of queries, query reformulations and URL visits during the course of a search session ( e.g., by generalizing some of the techniques developed i n [7]). Another direction for improvement would be t o better support searchers in articulating their information goals. One way to do so would be to offer query suggestions that a re guided by the frequencies of queries in the search session. Any such modifications to ranking or query suggestion algori thms would benefit from a better understanding of how query an d URL frequencies change over time in response to news ev ents, Internet memes, and so on. There are also a number of interesting empirical an d theoretical extensions of this work which we would like to exam ine. An important direction is to develop additional method s for automatically identifying searcher X  X  information go als, and to improve the identification of sessions that are ass ociated with the same information goal. We have explored using the f inal SERP Click or URL Visit to represent the information goa l, but we could extend this by considering characteristics of domains in addition to URLs, or classifying URLs into a taxono my like the Open Directory to provide a higher-level topical re presentation of search activities. We would also like to complemen t our large-scale log analyses with field studies to obtain a r icher understanding of searcher X  X  information goals and t o develop predictive models along the lines of those proposed by Fox et al. [8] to link session outcomes and implicit behaviora l patterns. Another future direction involves understanding the dynamics of search sessions, including how searchers move from common to rare information goals or vice versa, in both their query reformulations and in the pages they visit. Finall y, as search engines begin to incorporate user histories in rank ings, there are a variety of interesting challenges in how best to co mbine individual and aggregate query and interaction hist ory to support individuals in satisfying their rare or common info rmation needs.
