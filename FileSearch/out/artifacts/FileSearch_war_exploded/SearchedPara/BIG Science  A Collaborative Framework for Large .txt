 and technology aimed at cohesive collaboration. This poster proposes a Big Science collaboration system. Several existing technologies and tools aid Big Science pr ojects in communication (e.g. email, Skype [1], or SMS), knowledge transfer (e.g. CiteSeer [2], or Web of Science [3]), or access to funding through institutions such as the National Science Foundation (NSF). Websites such as the Interactive Autism Network (IAN) [4], link researchers and community members for sharing information and data. Current research on large scale collaborative projects focus on topics such as server architecture for supporting collaborative work (e.g., [5]), data sharing (e.g., [6]), and supporting creativity in distributed scientific communities (e.g., [7]). Although these approaches enable constant access to data, information or colleagues, they are not specifically designed to identify cohesion in research projects and potential co llaborations. This role usually falls to people. Spencer et al. argue that successful projects depend on social interactions, and project managers play a key role in managing relationships [8]. In a review of research on informal information systems, Holla nd identifies people called  X  X pecial communicators X  as a key source of information [9].  X  X pecial communicators X  are identifiable individuals with high  X  X nformation potential (IP), X  that is, they possess a high quantity of quality information that they make accessible to colleagues [9]. Holland describes a number of characteristics of special communicators, in particular they are  X  X atalysts X  of information: they make connections between ideas, and refer colleagues to each other. Our goal is to develop a syst em modeled after the  X  X pecial communicator X  that automatically identifies cohesion across large projects. The system will support both reporting, i.e., to agencies funding large projects, and identifying opportunities for collaborations. We propose a Big Science collaboration system that will use Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data methods to identify project cohesion and create effective collaborative connections. This system will create links betwee n papers with information automatically extracted from the text and bibliography, and group papers to identify places of are finding their information, the social media links could tell us which re searchers are talking to each other . After we have compiled our database, we will analyze the data and use machine learning to develop a function for good collaboration. We will introduce trainin g sets of data to our system to teach it where matches are typically found and which matches are most helpful. Using the links between papers described above, the system will develop its own theories about matching papers via neural networks and support ve ctor machines. This process will be guided by a user -driven recommendation system, which provides heuristic values for variables such as reference quality. Neural networks are networks of individual functions that act similarly to neurons i n a central nervous system. Each input is run through the network which weights and transforms the value to assign an output value [10]. Using our training data, the system will develop a function to weight the importance of each variable for determining s imilarity, e.g. text classification, keywords, similar links, etc. It will apply the function to the papers to find those most related. SVMs use algorithms to separate sets of data based on what is most similar. Our system wi ll plot each paper onto a field such that similar papers are closer together, and divide up the papers into groups that are most similar [10]. From there we will identify links between groups, which may suggest that a paper in one group has a higher probab ility of being related to a paper from the other group than other papers. To further support these learning algorithms, we will provide an interface that enables users to provide feedback to the system. Similar to sites like Pandora [11] and Spotify [12] that recommend music based on user preferences, the system will use this feedback to recommend other papers, while continuously training itself by creating new links between papers researchers have  X  X iked. X  This research ai ms to support Big Science projects by supporting project cohesion. We propose a system that will identify cohesion in the project by analyzing papers and researchers X  social networks. The system will automatically create links between papers by extracting information from text and bibliographies. It will use machine learning algorithms to develop functions to identify related papers, and recommend opportunities for collaboration to researchers.
