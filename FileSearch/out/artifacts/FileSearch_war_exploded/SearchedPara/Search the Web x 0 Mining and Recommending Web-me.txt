 Nowadays, people have been increasingly interested in ex-ploiting Web Search Engines (WSEs) not only for having access to simple Web pages, but mainly for accomplishing even complex activities, namely Web-mediated processes (or taskflows ). Thus, users X  information needs will become more complex, and Web search and recommender systems should change accordingly for dealing with this shift.
 We claim that such taskflows and their composing tasks are implicitly present in users X  minds when they interact with a WSE to access the Web. Our first research challenge is thus to evaluate this belief by analyzing a very large, long-term log of queries submitted to a WSE, and associating mean-ingful semantic labels with the extracted tasks (i.e., clusters of related queries) and taskflows. This large knowledge base constitutes a good starting point for building a model of users X  behaviors. The second research challenge is to devise a novel recommender system that goes beyond the simple query suggestion of modern WSEs. Our system has to ex-ploit the knowledge base of Web-mediated processes and the learned model of users X  behaviors, to generate complex in-sights and task-based suggestions to incoming users while they interact with a WSE.

Recently, people have started to exploit the Web not only for having access to its huge document collection but also for accomplishing their everyday activities in a simpler way. This vision is also supported by authoritative people in the Web search domain. During the DEMOFall08 Conference, there was a discussion panel on  X  X here the Web is Going X  1 in which Peter Norvig from Google and Prabhakar Raghavan from Yahoo! basically agreed that, rather than supporting only one search at a time, WSEs will soon focus on help-ing people get a bigger task done. A significative quote extracted from Raghavan X  X  speech is the following:  X  X eople intrinsically don X  X  want to search. People don X  X  come to work every day saying  X  X  need to search X ... They want to run their lives!  X  .
 So far, several works investigated how real search intent can be devised by looking at the queries users issued to WSEs [5, 23, 12, 10]. Following this research direction, we plan to go one step forward aiming to understand users X  behaviors on a task-based perspective. From our preliminary study of historical data stored on a very large and long-term WSE query log, we pointed out a significative set of sample ac-tivities that many users tried to achieve by issuing some independent query chains. We will refer to those activities as Web-mediated processes or taskflows , which typically rely on the composition of smaller tasks. In particular, we se-lected the birthday party planning as the running example we will consider hereinafter. This taskflow occurred quite frequently in our WSE query log as the result of stream of queries issued by different users. Moreover, each user tried to accomplish this big task through her own composition of smaller tasks (i.e., renting an accommodation, contact-ing one or more entertainers, reserving a food service, etc.). To some extent, this enforce the vision provided by Ricardo Baeza-Yates from Yahoo!, who claimed that in the next so-called Web 3.0  X  People want to get tasks done  X  2 . So, we can claim an interesting shift here from a model where each search is independent, to one where Web search sup-port systems may expect users to do multiple searches when trying to accomplish their activities.
 This novel way of searching the Web  X  X y tasks to be exe-cuted X , instead of  X  X y documents to be retrieved X , has to be enabled by new mechanisms that we aim to investigate. Thus, our first research challenge is to build a knowledge base from the WSE query log, which takes into account also the semantic meaning associated with tasks (i.e., clusters of topically-related queries) and taskflows. Then, this large knowledge base will help to devise a model of new users X  behaviors in which users perform multiple search for accom-plishing their activities. Finally, this semantic knowledge can also be exploited for implementing novel and task-based recommender strategies that go beyond the simple query suggestion nowadays available.
 The rest of this document is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the proposed research steps we intend to follow. Furthermore, Section 3 describes the result we expect to achieve, while Section 4 shows some preliminary results ob-tained through the work done so far. Finally, Section 5 provides a summary of the whole Ph.D. thesis proposal.
The aim of this Ph.D. thesis is to investigate and propose new Web search and recommender mechanisms  X  for allow-ing people to run their lives on the Web!  X  3 . In other terms, we will examine how to help people in  X  using the Web for doing (almost) everything  X .
 Most of the activities people traditionally performed in their everyday lives can be modeled as workflows consisting of tasks somehow composed together. In our vision, people will be increasingly interested in exploiting the Web for accom-plishing those activities. Thus, Web usage should change dramatically because people will access the Web for execut-ing their tasks instead of simply retrieving Web pages (even if a simple Web page can potentially be a part of a Web-mediated process). Hence, novel mechanisms providing new features and capabilities for facing with that change in user search behavior will be needed.
 Several approaches have been proposed for analyzing how people usually search the Web by mining WSEs query logs [19, 10, 16, 20, 15]. Roughly speaking, WSEs query logs record information about the search activities of users. Thus, most works aim at understanding the real intent behind queries issued by users [5, 23, 12, 10], while others deal with the identification of users X  search sessions [21, 4, 11]. Anyway, we strongly believe that historical data stored in query logs can be helpful for proving the shift of Web usage we claimed. On the basis of that, we organize our work according to the following steps. First, we plan to identify small search goals from a WSE query log by using a novel clustering technique for grouping topic-related queries. Each identified cluster should represent a specific user intent aiming to achieve an atomic task, which potentially can be a part of a more com-plex taskflow. Moreover, since clusters lack of semantic in-formation, we have to fill up that gap by adding meaningful labels to clusters of queries. Founded clusters of queries to-gether with their semantic labels will constitute a valuable knowledge base of the tasks people aim to perform. There-fore, we plan to learn a model dealing with how users enact complex taskflows on the Web, i.e., how atomic tasks are composed together. Finally, as the ultimate and most im-portant goal, we aim to investigate how taskflows or parts of them can be recommended, going one step further than current Web recommender systems of modern WSEs.
 In the following, we will describe all those steps more deeply.
The very first step of our analysis aims at finding search goals associated with users of a WSE. We start choosing the 2006 AOL query log as the initial data set. This is a large and long-term collection, which consists of about 20 million Web queries issued by more than 657 thousands users over 3 months. Suitable mechanisms for extracting search goals are clustering algorithms and techniques ap-plied to the whole query session of each user. Query clus-tering is a quite recent research issue and it is based on the assumption that if two queries belong to the same clus-ter, then they are also likely to be topically-related [3, 22, 7, 13, 24]. As for any other clustering problem, research has to be focused mainly on two aspects: (i) the similar-ity metrics used for computing the distance between queries and (ii) the clustering algorithm to be run on data. Many similarity metrics have been proposed for query clustering, some of them derive from traditional document clustering in information retrieval domain [18], while others exploit cross-reference between queries and user activities (i.e., relevance feedback) [17]. Recently, hybrid solutions that combine both content-and feedback-based approaches have shown to be more effective [7]. Moreover, inter-query temporal interval must be taken into account, especially when dealing with long-term historical data [6].
 In our work, we have devised an extended K-means -like al-gorithm that uses a novel similarity metrics, which combines query content features, inter-query temporal interval, and a new feature based on the collaborative knowledge base col-lected by Wiktionary 4 . Since the average number of query terms ranges between 2 and 3 words [19], we expand each query with its  X  wiktionarization  X . Basically, we exploit the Wiktionary data source for increasing the meaningfulness of each query, trying to overcome the lack of information it usually carries on. Collaborative knowledge bases like Wik-tionary and Wikipedia have been recently used for increas-ing semantic relatedness between words in natural language processing domain [26, 25, 14]. However, to the best of our knowledge, these features have not yet been used for query clustering.
 As a final result of query clustering we find a set of search goal clusters C i = { c 1 i , c 2 i , . . . , c h i } for each user u WSE, where each goal cluster is a sequence of issued queries c query session.
Query clustering provides an effective way of grouping together similar queries according to the chosen metrics. Moreover, query clustering implicitly breaks the whole search session of a user in a more precise way with respect to tra-ditional timeout-based approaches [19, 8]. Thus, while we can be quite confident that queries inside the same cluster refer to the same task, we still have to understand the real meaning of the task. In fact, clusters per se do not carry any kind of semantic information about the search goal they re-fer to. In order to deal with that lack of semantic, we plan to add meaningful labels to a set of sample clusters for de-scribing the search goals they represent. Such labels could be possibly provided also automatically by exploiting the Wikipedia knowledge base at clustering-time. Anyway, we expect to collect a sample labeled data source, which will represent a semantic knowledge base of users search goals (i.e., taxonomy of tasks). In addition, this semantic knowl-edge will be exploited for learning a model about the com-position of atomic tasks along with the temporal correla-tion of tasks. As an example, let us again consider the taskflow for organizing a birthday party. Suppose we are considering 3 clusters of queries c x i =  X  q i,x 1 , q i,x c related to user u i . Moreover, let L x i , L y i , and L mantic labels associated with each cluster according to its meaning. Suppose also L x i refers to something related to birthday supplies, L y i deals with cooking or ordering on-line a cake, and finally L z i refers to a theme party. Thus, we will be able to identify the entire Web-mediated process (i.e., birthday party planning) starting from a set of un-linked search goals by considering the semantic knowledge base provided with the labels.
Recently, popular WSEs have started to support users with query suggestions to help them in formulating better queries, hence to quickly satisfy their needs. Query recom-mendation techniques are based on the behaviors of users recorded in WSEs query logs [27, 4, 9, 2]. We strongly believe that the shift in Web usage should force next Web retrieval systems to make a step forward and to rely on novel recommender mechanisms [1]. We claim that next Web rec-ommender systems should deal with two orthogonal issues: (i) what items should be recommended and (ii) how recom-mendation should be performed. Of course, suggestions will still take place at search-time, but they should be provided by taking into account a window of users X  search activities, instead of recommending items on a search-by-search basis. Regarding the first issue (i), several items dealing with smaller tasks as well as entire taskflows could be recommended. Thus, a key point here is how suggested information con-cerning tasks and taskflows are presented to users. As an example, items to be recommended could be the most rele-vant queries and/or Web resources associated with a certain task or taskflows, as well as their semantic labels. Concerning the second issue (ii), we believe that the most suitable suggestion mechanism will be provided combining both content-based and collaborative approaches, also known as hybrid recommender systems according to [1]. Collabo-rative approaches make use of user profiling for providing recommendations. Typically, a user profile contains items together with their expressed ratings. However, in our case, items whose users are interested in are not directly avail-able. On the other hand, items could be figured out from the semantic information associated with user X  X  historical behaviors (i.e., groups of semantically-related queries and visited Web pages), following content-based approaches. So, content-based approaches will be useful for generating items, which in turn can be recommended in a collaborative way on the basis of users X  profiles. Moreover, user profile could be either short-or long-term depending on the amount of historical data from which it was created, and it should take care of user X  X  contextual information as well as her dynamic behavior.
 To put it simply, if user u is approaching to perform a task-flow t x , the semantic knowledge base of tasks could be ex-ploited for suggesting to u some or all of the steps that other users chose for accomplishing t x . The key point here is to recognize what thaskflow u is going to perform by simply looking at her profile. At first glance, a possible solution should take into account the short-term profile of u (i.e., one or a few issued queries) and compute their similarity related-ness with representative queries in the taskflows knowledge base. Moreover, if u performed the taskflow t x and from the knowledge base of taskflows we figured out that users who have accomplished t x are likely to accomplish also t y , then t should be recommended also to user u .
 Let us now again consider our running taskflow example. If a user issues the query  X  X irthday supplies X  the recommender system should guess user could be interested in accomplish-ing the whole process for organizing a birthday party. Then, by making a comparison between the user X  X  query and the knowledge base of tasks, recommender system should also suggest other small tasks composing the whole taskflow (i.e.,  X  X rdering on-line a cake X ). Similarly, if users interested in or-ganizing a birthday party are also usually interested in rent-ing a DVD then whenever someone will ask for organizing a birthday party the taskflow for renting a DVD could be also recommended. Of course, those are only some examples of recommendation strategies we have envisioned but many other scenarios could come out in the future.
First, we expect our query log analysis will confirm the shift we guessed about how people have been going to use the Web. Moreover, we believe that our whole work will improve other results concerning different research topics. Regarding query clustering issue, we strongly rely on the enhancement derived from using the collaborative knowl-edge base provided by Wiktionary for computing the simi-larity between queries. Consequently, better query cluster-ing should provide a better way of splitting the entire query log into meaningful user sessions, so that each cluster will identify a search goal session more precisely. We also expect that labeling of query clusters will be useful for building a sort of taxonomy of users search goals, whose benefits are ev-ident. Therefore, by linking together small goals (i.e., tasks) according to that taxonomy, we should be able to find more complex Web-mediated processes. Finally, a broad spec-trum of recommender strategies can be envisioned: from a simple suggestion of a possibly interesting query to the rec-ommendation of sequences of relevant queries and/or Web resources concerning with tasks or entire taskflows.
We have almost completed the first step of our planned activities, namely query clustering. In particular, we are evaluating the results of our clustering algorithm. Evalua-tion of identified query clusters are now conducted by user studies , and it will be expressed in terms of classical infor-mation retrieval metrics like coverage , precision , recall , and F-measure .
 In the following, we will show a significative sample of clus-ters that have been identified by our algorithm we have men-tioned in Section 2.1. In particular, Figure 1 shows three sample clusters together with a representative query for each cluster identified for a specific AOL user.
 Those clusters are clearly related to the taskflows for orga-nizing a birthday party, which we already used as running
Figure 1: Three sample clusters for an AOL user. example here in this document. Different colors are bound to different atomic tasks of the whole process. Moreover, meaningful labels can be associated with the clusters: i.e.,  X  X IFT X ,  X  X IRTHDAY CAKE X , and  X  X HEME PARTY X , re-spectively.
This document outlines the research activity plan concern-ing with my Ph.D. thesis proposal. According to the most authoritative researchers in Web domain, the way in which users search the Web are rapidly changing. In particular, Web Search Engines (WSEs) may expect users to do multi-ple searches when trying to accomplish their everyday activ-ities. Thus, this novel way of searching the Web  X  X y tasks to be executed X  instead of  X  X y documents to be retrieved X  has to be enabled by new mechanisms, which should be able to deal with Web-mediated processes. Hence, our first research challenge is to evaluate this belief by analyzing a very large, long-term log of queries submitted to a WSE, and associat-ing meaningful semantic labels with the extracted tasks (i.e., clusters of related queries) and taskflows. This large knowl-edge base constitutes a good starting point for building a model of users X  behaviors. The second research challenge is to devise a novel recommender system that goes beyond the simple query suggestion of modern WSEs. Our system has to exploit the knowledge base of Web-mediated processes and the learned model of users X  behaviors, to generate com-plex insights and task-based suggestions to incoming users while they interact with a WSE.
