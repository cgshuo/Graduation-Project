 In the same way that hyperlinks enable the crea-tion of connections betw een documents, current semantic web technologies enable the establish-ment of connections or links between or among pieces of data, information, and knowledge, in what is known as the Linked Data paradigm 1 , with the goal of better exploiting them in linked data-driven Web applications (Hausenblas, 2009). lieve that terminology has much to contribute to this field. In the past, terminology work was ex-tensively applied to the identification of terms and relations for their subsequent transformation into concepts and conceptual relations in ontolo-gies (Velardi et al., 2001; Aussenac-Guilles and S X rgel, 2005; Maynard et al., 2008; to mention just a few). Currently, works on terminological variation may play a significant role in the Linked Data linking step. for publishing and connecting distributed data on the Web with the idea of transforming it into a global graph . For this purpose, data must be pre-viously structured according to graph-based models in the form of ontologies, using the stan-dard RDF (Resource Description Framework) syntax. Moreover, these data or information units have to use URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) as their names on the Web, and follow the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) schema so that users can look up those names and find the in-formation related to them . Finally, data have to be connected to similar data, so that users can explore those data and discover additional data. Thus, the more links an RDF dataset has to other datasets, the more useful it will be. one that involves greater difficulties. As stated in (Heath and Bizer, 2011), it is common practice to use the property or relation owl:sameAs to state that one data source in an  X  X DF dataset A X  provides the same information as another data source in an  X  X DF dataset B X . But, is it easy to identify two data sources in different RDF data-sets that mean the same? Can it be done auto-matically, or does it require an expert to analyze and compare the datasets? Ideally, taking into account the number of RDF datasets currently published as Linked Data 2 , this task should be performed automatically. forming data into the linked data format was ini-tially led by English speaking countries, nowadays we find an increasing amount of RDF datasets in languages other than English that need to be linked to similar or related datasets in other languages (G X mez-P X rez et al., 2013). cornerstone in communicative and cognitive ap-proaches to terminology (Cabr X  1995, Daille 2005, Temmerman, 2000) could contribute to the identification of terms that refer to the same on-tological concept, thus attempting to integrate univocity, defended by the traditional theory (W X ster, 1979) with variation in real situations. The result of such an analysis could be used in the automatic identification of concepts that mean the same or that hold a certain type of rela-tion. It could also contribute to the definition of the reasons that caused that variation, and pro-pose alternatives to the owl:sameAs property to capture more fine-grained relations between data sources. Finally, from a multilingual per-spective, it could also help to establish cross-lingual relations between RDF datasets in vari-ous languages. Data datasets should be enriched with termino-logical variants, as well as with other types of lexical and linguistic information as proposed in (McCrae et al., 2011; Graci a et al., 2012), so that further processes in the Linked Open Data Cloud construction  X  specifically the linking step  X  become smoother and more reliable. Such en-richment could also be very profitable due to its potential exploitation by linked data-driven Web applications. tion of lexical, terminological and semantic vari-ants that has been proposed within the framework of the W3C Ontology-Lexica Com-munity Group 3 to enhance a model of linguistic descriptions intended to enrich domain ontolo-gies and RDF datasets. The model being de-signed in this framework relies on previous computational models of linguistic description, such as LMF (Francopoulo, 2013; ISO 24613), SKOS (Miles et al., 2005), or, fundamentally, the lemon model (McCrae et al., 2011). denominative variation in communicative ap-proaches to terminology, in section 2 we revisit previous classifications of terminological vari-ants in the light of the Linked Data paradigm. In other to justify the proposed classification, in section 3 we provide examples of modelling so-lutions for the different types of variants (lexical, terminological and semantic variants). We com-pare the mechanisms provided by available mod-els (SKOS) to represent such variants, in contrast to the richer, more complex model of linguistic descriptions that is being proposed in the W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group and that takes as starting point the lemon model. Finally, in section 4, we present some concluding re-marks and discuss some further lines of research. As suggested in Cabr X  (2008), term variants that refer to one and the same concept can be divided into two types: (1) Term variants that are seman-tically coincident but formally different , i.e., terms that mean the same but are expressed by different lexical forms, generally known as synonyms (e.g., eczema vs. skin rash); and (2) Term variants that are semantically and formally different , since each one is highlighting one facet or dimension of the same concept (e.g., hospital waste vs. biomedical waste), so that they do not mean exactly the same , but refer to the same concept or real world entity. The same author refers to the latter variants as partial synonyms and leaves open the question of whether the two terms should point to the same concept or each term should point to a different concept, with many assumed commonalities between the two. view of a model that is designed to associate complex linguistic descriptions to conceptual structures (ontologies, RDF datasets), because it informs how lexical and terminological descrip-tions of the concepts are represented. If the con-ceptual structure is already given and contains that conceptual difference (let us say that it makes a distinction between biosanitary waste , in general, and hospital waste , only for the waste produced in hospitals), the two terms will most probably be associated to two different concepts. Conversely, if only one concept is represented in the ontology, we may still want to account for both terminological variants in the linguistic model, and explicitly state the motivation behind each denomination. In this way, we would also facilitate the linking of this data source to an-other data source contained in a different dataset and to which only the term biosanitary waste has been associated. the causes that provoked the variation, and has been inspired for the terminological part on the work by Freixa on denominative variation in terminology (2006). In this case, we distinguish between lexical, terminological and semantic or cognitive variants. Each type of variant will be devoted a sub-section below. 2.1 Lexical variants For the purposes of this work, lexical variants are defined as those variants that are semantically coincident but formally different , and which are mainly motivated by grammatical requirements, style ( Wortklang ), and linguistic economy (help-ing to avoid excessive denominative repetition and improving textual coherence) 4 . As Freixa (2006: 61) maintains for acronyms and reduc-tions of terms, this lexical variation has a high level of conceptual equivalence. Also, the use of one variant over the other does not really change the intention of the message, but it is rather caused by formal aspects of the text. 
The following types can be mentioned: 2.2 Terminological variants As for terminological variants, we understand those variants that are not only formally, but also semantically different , and this difference is in-tentionally caused. As stated in Diki-Kidiri (2000:29 and ff), in order to better understand this type of variants, it may be useful to make a distinction between concept and meaning or sense ( le signifiant, le signifi X  and le concept ), since we could say that these terminological variants refer to the same concept but they repre-sent  X  X he multiple specific perceptions of the same object X . nomination or term itself is a clear indicator of the reasons or causes for variation. As mentioned in Freixa (2006), these reasons can be the origins of the authors, in the case of diatopic variants; the different communicative registers, in the case of diaphasic variants (also termed functional variants); the stylistic or expressive needs of the authors, as for the so-called diastratic variants; and the different conceptualizations, approaches or perspectives underlying them, in what we have termed dimensional variants (dubbed cogni-tive variants in Freixa (2006)). emphasize that it is more common than not to find different conceptualizations of the same domain when different groups approach the same area of knowledge from different perspectives or with different needs. Because of that, some terms may highlight certain properties of a concept, which are not so relevant for other users. This is even more obvious in a multilingual context, in which different geographical, cultural and social groups comprehend reality in different ways. In this sense, we have included a subtype of dimen-sional variants called cross-lingual dimensional variants . lingual variants. It could be argued that these are not terminological variants strictly speaking, but translations. However, we have decided to con-sider them a subtype of variants with the aim of covering those scenarios in the Linked Data con-text in which datasets in different natural lan-guages have to be linked and this linkage becomes essential in this new paradigm. variants. First, we include translations, in the general sense. It is widely accepted that original and target cultures have segmented and catego-rized a bit of reality in a very similar way and have a similar concept a nd equivalent term to refer to it. We do not account for the reasons for this similarity (it may be that one culture has im-ported not only the concept but also the term by providing a loan translation, etc.). However, we account for the case in wh ich the target culture has no equivalent concept and describes the con-cept of the original culture and/or directly reuses the foreign term. also have cross-lingual diaphasic variants , if one language uses the scientific term in all registers, and the other language has two terms: one for an expert-to-expert communication situation and another term for an expert-lay communication situation (e.g., huesos metacarpianos in Spanish vs. Ossa metacarpi and Mittelhandknochen in German). The same could happen in the case of diachronic and diastratic variants. a multilingual scenario these terminological vari-ants would be pointing to the same concept or conceptual structure, or even share the same con-ceptualization. This is one of the main differ-ences compared to the variants in section 2.3, namely, the so-called semantic or cognitive vari-ants. 
So, we have classified terminological variants as follows: 2.3 Semantic or Cognitive Variants Semantic or cognitive vari ants are mainly caused by different conceptualization and/or motiva-tions. We could say that these term variants are semantically and formally different, as in the case of terminological variants, but they usually point to two closely related, but different, onto-logical concepts, which m eans that they are also conceptually different (Aguado-de-Cea and Montiel-Ponsoda, 2012). lingual level, but we can also found them in monolingual contexts. Let us imagine the case of an ontology or dataset that contains the concept religious building , and another ontology that contains the concept of mosque . At the linguistic level we could say that religious building and mosque are in a relation of hypernymy-hyponymy (one concept is subsumed by the oth-er, but they are referring to two different con-cepts included in two different conceptual structures that have a different granularity level). (general-specific) or horizontal variants. Vertical variants are defined as those variants that refer to concepts that share most properties, but one is more specific than the other (they are not at the same level in a classification tree, but one is more general and the other more specific. See the example of river in English vs. rivi X re and fleuve in French). In the case of horizontal variants, we refer to those terms that point to concepts that share most properties, but one includes proper-ties that the other does not, and vice versa. As a result of these divergences, terms will be point-ing to two different concepts in two different conceptual structures at the same level of speci-ficity in a classification tree, but including une-qual properties. Therefore, we can consider them counterparts or closest equivalents. Within this group we find the following types: Incorporating all this terminological knowledge in ontologies is important if we aim at optimiz-ing the linking process. Thus, distinguishing dif-ferent forms of term variation turns into a key issue, when we model terminology for practical applications. In the context of linked data this means that we will model the data by means of an existing model such as SKOS or lemon . In this section we present practical modelling ex-amples for kind of term variation. 3.1 Lexical variants Lexical variants are modelled by either the mul-tiple forms of the same entry or by means of re-lationships between lexical entries. For example in lemon , we would model orthographic variants as different representations of the same form 6 : In the example above, a monolingual lemon lexi-con is defined which contains a lexical entry :theatre_lexicalentry . The concept  X  X heatre X  in a certain ontology is the reference of such lexical entry, which has two associated written represen-tations:  X  X heater X  and  X  X heatre X  for American and British English respectively. Alternatively, two different lexical entries could have been defined for each different representa-tion. In that case, a relation can be defined be-tween the lexical entries in lemon in this way: In this example  X  X heater X  and  X  X heatre  X  are asso-ciated to two different lexical entries. They are linked by a new relation :diatopicVariant , which is defined as a subtype of a lemon lexical variant. Notice that :diatopicVariant does not exist in the lemon model as such, but it can be defined as in the example or, alternatively, an external cate-gory could be used, such as "diatopical" includ-ed in ISOCAT 7 . Morphosyntactic variants are also represented as links between lexical entries, as there may be differences in the syntactic properties of the en-tries. Let us consider the term  X  X eer to peer X  and its abbreviated form  X  X 2p X : In the previous example :p2p and :peer_to_peer are lexical entries with their respective written representations. Then, ISOCAT categories are defined as lexical variants and used to relate or link both lexical entries 8 . We can also use SKOS for representing lexical variants. In that case, we can show two preferred labels for different dialects of a language as fol-lows: However, to represent morphosyntactic variants it is necessary to use the extended label model (SKOS-XL) as follows, but, otherwise, it is simi-lar to lemon, where we define a named label en-tity for each label and represent the link between them as a triple. 3.2 Terminological variants As terminological variants maintain the meaning of the term while changing the surface form, it is necessary to distinguish between the syntactic and semantic level of the term. For this reason, we characterize terminological variants as links between different senses not between lexical en-tries. In lemon this is easy to model as can be seen in the following example: In the example above, an entity of biontology-icd 9 has been associated with two lemon senses. Such senses constitute the bridge between the ontology entities and thei r respective lexical en-tries. Then, the temporal dimension ( X  X odern X  vs.  X  X ld X ) can be established as an attribute of the senses (by using the LexInfo vocabulary (Cimiano et al , 2011) in our example). Alternatively, a relation at the level of senses can be established in lemon in this way: However, there is no way to make this distinc-tion in SKOS and this will lead inevitably to con-fusion about the syntactic and semantic layer. 3.3 Semantic or cognitive variants Cognitive variants are distinct but closely related meanings of a word. So, we can model the varia-tion not only as a relationship between words but also as described by a semantic model, i.e., an ontology. As such, we would state OWL axioms to describe the relationshi p, as illustrated in the example below. There, Chancellor of Germany and Prime Minister of Spain are both subclasses of the concept Head of government. At the lexicon level we could also establish a relation of horizontal variants between the two terms. This relation is established because we know that the two terms  X  X hancellor of Ger-many X  and  X  X rime Minister of Spain X  are not equal but can be considered similar (or counter-parts) in the two cultural settings, as they have a close antecedent concept,  X  X ead of government X . As mentioned in this paper, the Linked Data ini-tiative needs to find ways of linking the huge amount of structured datasets found on the Web in the same or in different languages. We believe that although ontologies aim at achieving uni-vocity in as much as traditional terminology did, the more sociolinguistic cognitive approaches to terminology can also contribute to enrich the current computational models of linguistic de-scriptions. With this purpose, we have revisited previous classifications of term variants in the light of the Linked Data initiative so as to facili-tate the process of recognition of terminological variation. We have proposed a classification of term variants in three wide groups: lexical vari-ants, terminological variants and semantic or cognitive variants. We have also illustrated this classification with the corresponding examples at the ontology level by resorting to different ontol-ogy representation models, such as lemon . With the solutions proposed we also aim to enrich the linguistic ontology models as well as to make them more reliable when applied to Linked Data. This work has been sup ported by the BabelData (TIN2010-17550) Spanish project and the FP7 European project Monnet (FP7-ICT-4-248458).
