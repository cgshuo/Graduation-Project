 1. Introduction Textures are encountered almost in all digital pictures from conventional photography to seismic and microscopy images. as in magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT). Although, image textures do not have a rigorous mathemat-ness or shape. In biomedical images, tissues appear with different textures which enable their characterization based on texture properties.
 there are two more categories; which are based on models and signal processing methods. Model based approaches aim ture analysis is suggested by Tuceryan and Jain in [26] and has been widely used in the literature.
Texture analysis in biomedical image processing is used for several applications [8,23,9,14,25,30], two of them are seg-texture orientation estimation algorithm.
 tional filter banks [36] and wavelets [41] are commonly used filter based approaches. Higher dimension versions of these to analyze high frequency components at shorter, low frequency components at longer intervals. There are many wavelet parison of filter based texture feature extraction methods can be found in [42].

In this work, we used a recent wavelet method, the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) [13]. DT-CWT is ance becomes important; since tissues can turn and orient themselves on different directions. There are various ways of tract rotation invariant DT-CWT texture features in [34].

We propose two additional DT-CWT approaches in this work to equalize the sensitivity and increase the directional selec-tivity of DT-CWT. We tested them along with Hatipoglu X  X  and Hill X  X  methods in segmentation and classification problems. sub-bands can be created which we used to estimate the direction of anisotropy.
 texture, a realistic skeletal muscle model and an actual MR image are used. 2. Methods and material 2.1. Preliminaries on texture analysis and DT-CWT
Wavelet based texture analysis inherently regards the problem of describing textures at finer and coarser scales due to position is a favored property of such approaches.
 lems in shift variance, Kingsbury suggested designing an analytic wavelet transform [13]. This relatively recent wavelet
This property of complex wavelets is studied comprehensively with comparison to DWT in [48]. DT-CWT also has a higher patterns.

The idea behind DT-CWT is inspired from the Fourier transform (FT) which does not suffer from shift variance. This prop-erty of FT is based on complex-valued oscillating signals which form a Hilbert pair i.e. 90  X  out of phase components:
Kingsbury proposed to construct a complex-valued wavelet basis which also forms a Hilbert pair:
Therefore, similar to FT, DT-CWT can decompose a signal into real and imaginary components. These components are ob-which is shown in Fig. 1 . 2.2. DT-CWT based texture feature extraction methods 2.2.1. Standard DT-CWT features
Filter based texture feature extraction methods have been studied intensively and comparisons of different methods exist applying a non-linear transform followed by a smoothing function.

The first DT-CWT based texture feature extraction method we propose in this work follows the common approach ex-plained in the above paragraph. Between non-linearity and smoothing, resizing is done on decomposed images in order to compensate for down-sampling. Non-linearity used in this work is quadratic, which is followed by a Gaussian smoothing function. This feature extraction approach is shown in Fig. 2 .

 way: 2.2.2. Rotation invariant DT-CWT features features.

In order to use DFT, the features in the set f L h  X  x ; y  X  must be sorted. Let following form: Applying DFT on ~ f L  X  n yields: F and F L  X  k values for k = 4, 5 can be omitted since j F L scheme creates four features for each level of decomposition. 2.2.3. Improved DT-CWT features pared to them. The difference in sensitivity can be observed from the 2D impulse response of DT-CWT shown in Fig. 3 .
Kingsbury explained the cause of unevenly orientated components and suggested a method to construct equally sensitive oriented sub-bands. On the other hand, Kokare and Biswas developed a new complex wavelet method which is inspired from DT-CWT and introduced six new oriented sub-bands [22]. This method is named the Dual-Tree Rotated Complex Wavelet Filter (DT-RCWF). DT-RCWT can decompose an image into 12 differently oriented sub-bands when jointly used with DT-CWT. However, DT-RCWF plus DT-CWT combination also suffers from unevenly sensitive oriented decompositions. The application of this approach is shown until non-linearity in Fig. 4 ; the rest is same as the standard method.
Table 1 shows the orientations of the decomposed rotated images and the selected features. Here strikethrough orienta-tions are the excluded unevenly sensitive components and underlined decompositions are the discarded duplicates.

Table 2 shows the number of features for each approach up to DT-CWT decomposition level 3. 2.3. 2D texture orientation maps (TOM)
Oriented features can be used to create texture orientation maps (TOM) which are used in this study to demonstrate the using the following steps: (2) For L  X  p , project f p h  X  x ; y  X  on to 2D Cartesian coordinates using the following relation: (3) Assign: (4) Interpolate X  X  h  X  and Y  X  h  X  for the rest of h values. 2.4. 3D texture orientation estimation
Having explained the necessary background information in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.3 we propose an iterative volumetric ori-entations on 12 different cut-planes are compared and the strongest direction of anisotropy is updated in an iterative briefly explained.

Given a 3D image v  X  x ; y ; z  X  , a point P 0 2 v  X  x ; y ; z  X  and a 2D plane that passes through P extends along the unit longitudinal vector L ! and unit transverse vector T vectors P ! points on the plane. After determining the grid points p ij
By rotating the initial T ! vector with respect to the longitudinal axis L obtained; i.e. for h  X f 0 ; 15 ; 30 ; 45 ; 60 ; 75 ;  X  90 g , 12 differently oriented planes can be created. oriented components are calculated. However 12 of these are repeated along L leaves behind 12 12 11  X  133 3D oriented decompositions per iteration to be compared.

The strongest orientation among the 133 decompositions is determined after texture features are calculated. This vector is compared with the previous strongest orientation; if the vectors are same, L strongest orientation is not the same as the previous one, L orientation. 2.5. Test images 2.5.1. 2D test images
There are 40 2D Brodatz texture [31] compositions used in the tests. These are synthetic images of size 512 512, made by random combinations of 56 different textures from the Brodatz database. We created four types of random compositions;
Type-A1, Type-A2, Type-B1 and Type-B2. Type-A1 compositions are made of combinations of 16 textures and Type-B1 com-positions are made of five textures. We used 10 Type-A1 and 10 Type-B1 compositions. To quantify the performance change in classification and segmentation problems under texture rotation we created Type-A2 and Type-B2 synthetic images by tions are shown along with the correct classification and segmentation.

Three real MR images are used in the tests in order to show the use of our work in clinical studies. We selected images contrast enhancement is done prior to tests. These images are shown in Fig. 8 .

Medical images used in the tests are T1 weighted MR image of the wrist and T2 weighted MR images of the brain and
The performances are assessed by comparing the results with manually done segmentations and classifications. The dimen-sion of the wrist image is 256 320 144 with a resolution of 0 : 5 0 : 5 0 : 4mm 3 . The brain MRI has dimensions 448 378 26 with 0 : 5134 0 : 5134 3 : 30 mm 3 resolution and liver image has dimensions 320 320 80 with voxel size of 1 : 1875 1 : 1875 4mm 3 . 2.5.2. 3D test images
There are three volume images used to test the 3D orientation estimation algorithm. Two of them are artificially created perfectly aligned on a single direction.

 3.1. Estimation and visualization of anisotropy using TOM directional, TOMs are helpful since similar textures have close TOMs. A sample TOM based on DT-CWT features calculated according to the scheme in Fig. 2 (2nd level decomposition) is shown in Fig. 10 .

In Section 2.2.3 we introduced a method that improves the directional texture features. In order to demonstrate this improvement, we include in Fig. 11 the results of the TOM for the same pixels shown in Fig. 10 . 3.2. Classification results calculated.

 Means and standard deviations of classification errors for Type-A1, Type-A2, Type-B1 and Type-B2 images are given in sification error when textures are rotated from Type-A1 and Type-B1 to Type-A2 and Type-B2. Smaller differences in clas-sification errors indicates more robust characterization of textures which undergo rotation. 3.3. Segmentation results
The segmentation method used in this work is based on the Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) snakes; an initial contour needs by internal(snake X  X  shape) and external(features determined from the image) forces. The major modification done on this external field is created based on texture similarity.
 the size of Gaussian smoothing kernel is decreased to 13 13 and 9 9 respectively, with the same standard deviation of r  X  4. The initial snakes placed on the images are shown in Fig. 14 . Examples from the segmentation results for Type-A1 and Type-B1 compositions are shown in Fig. 15 . Correct segmentations of the regions are given with green color. image indicate that the texture sample enclosed by the initial snake is similar to these areas. tained by the methods explained in this paper.

Besides the 40 random texture compositions used in this study, we also worked on the same two texture compositions Randen used in his work. Table 5 is modified from [42] and it shows the classification performances were obtain by using DT-CWT based rotation invariant methods.

For that, the improved rotation invariant DT-CWT features are planned to be worked more. Tables 3 and 4 show that these find especially the improved rotation invariant DT-CWT features promising for tissue characterization.
In this work we introduced a novel approach to obtain 12 differently oriented decompositions using a modified DT-CWT
With this work, it is shown that DT-CWT based texture feature extraction methods are appropriate choices to be used in be studied separately.
