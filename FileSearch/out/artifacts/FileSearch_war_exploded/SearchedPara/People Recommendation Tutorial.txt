 People recommenders have become a rich research area within the broad recommender systems community and social rec-ommender systems in particular. From  X  X eople you may know X  and  X  X ho to follow X  widgets, through people introduc-tion at conferences, job recommendations and job-candidate search, to dating partner matchmakers, people recommen-dations proliferate. This tutorial will present an overview of the people recommender systems domain. We will present the different types and use cases of people recommendations, the special techniques used to recommend people to them-selves, key research work, and open challenges.

In the past decade, people recommender systems have emerged as a prominent field within the recommender sys-tems domain, and social recommender systems in particu-lar. Recommending people to themselves has inherent reci-procity, which bears unique characteristics compared to tra-ditional item recommendation. Factors such as trust, rep-utation, privacy, and interpersonal attraction, play a more significant role in people recommenders than in traditional recommenders.

In this tutorial, we will discuss the key motivations driving people recommendation and review the fundamental recom-mendation approaches. We will present the key types of peo-ple recommendations, based on the nature and time-span of the relationship between the user and the recommended in-dividual. Each recommendation type will be demonstrated with principal case studies from the literature. We will then review evaluation techniques, with emphasis on the pros and cons of each method. Finally, we will summarize by discus-sion of open issues and challenges in the field.

The tutorial is intended for the broad RecSys audience and requires no prior knowledge.

 Ido gave a tutorial on Social recommender systems at WWW 2011 (with David Carmel), WWW 2014, and RecSys 2014 (with Werner Geyer). Luiz gave a tutorial named  X  X e-yond Friendship: The Art, Science and Applications of Rec-ommending People to People in Social Networks X  at RecSys 2013 (with Amnol Basin). That tutorial focused on recipro-cal recommenders and people recommenders as implemented on LinkedIn and on Online Dating companies. The scope of this tutorial is broader, and encompasses all types of peo-ple recommenders, including recent developments, such as recommendation of people to mention [3, 21], suggesting ac-tivity partners [20], and lifestyle-based recommendation [22].
