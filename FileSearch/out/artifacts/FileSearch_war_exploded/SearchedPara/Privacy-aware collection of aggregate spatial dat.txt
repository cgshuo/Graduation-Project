 1. Introduction
Collecting aggregate data from users is important to many applications. A typical data collection shows a number of categories as errors can lead to more unexpected results or hide problems of the data due to errors canceling each other.
Although the quality of the collected data can be improved using background knowledge [7] , we are interested in collecting data [9  X  11] , which is complementary to the true data. Researchers guarantee a strong privacy protection by encouraging surveys, we call the traditional data collections that collect true data positive surveys .

We envisage a simpli fi ed scenario that is used throughout the paper: a transportation authority wishes to know the number of from UNS are close to the true data ( Fig.3 ).

UNSs are not immune to errors during data reconstruction. We found that this problem is particularly severe when the ratio of otherscauseunder-counting.Thismaybedesirableforanindividualquerybutmayleadtomoresigni fi cantproblemsinthefutureasit relies on erroneous data. For example, other queries may not show the same behavior leading to user confusion. Also, in many the use of negative surveys. Thus, we propose GNSs, a method that does not generate negative counts.

We compare GNSs with UNSs and a common data perturbation technique, Uniform Retention Replacement Perturbations [12] , through comprehensive experiments. Our results show that GNSs achieve high privacy levels similar to the existing approaches but are signi fi cantly more accurate in solving queries.
 results are shown in Section 6 . We conclude our paper in Section 7 . 2. Related work 2.1. Privacy protection in statistical databases issued to a database. For example, successive queries may be blocked if new queries are highly overlapping with the existing data perturbation, output perturbation modi fi es the answer to a query when the query is solved based on original data. For example, the inclusion and exclusion of an entity in the answer to a query can be determined by a given probability. Negative surveys belong to data perturbation as the reported data is not the true data. Data perturbation can be further divided into randomization , swapping , generalization and encryption .
Randomization approaches distort the original data by adding a random value to the true value [12,16,17] . The randomizing parameter used for the distortion follows a certain distribution. Data swapping breaks the linkage between attributes by lowest level in the hierarchy. Values in a higher level are generalized from a lower level. Data generalization techniques are decryption. For example, Ge et al. proposed an approach to perform SUM and AVG queries on cipher text [23] . Another approach proposes a method to preserve the order of original values in encrypted data [24] .

It is important to note that these approaches cannot avoid the collection of true data. For example, the randomization many of the approaches, GNSs are also substantially easier to implement as data reconstruction and encryption are not needed. 2.2. Spatial data access methods accessed when the spatial ranges of their parent nodes are contained in the query range. The second direction focuses on on point objects and rectangular objects [33,34] . Many of the histogram-based approaches provide certain level of privacy not report true categories in the fi rst place. 2.3. Protection of location privacy data. One recent paper stresses the importance of the balance between location privacy and the accuracy of the aggregated data that privacy intervention approaches, including compensation, industry self-regulation, and government regulation, have an an individual cannot be distinguished from a number of other individuals [41,42] . Obfuscation-based techniques degrade the approach in answering range aggregate queries. 3. Preliminaries 3.1. Data collection and reconstruction in uniform negative surveys selected by a participant. ( c  X  1)  X  r j .Hence, e j is given as 3.2. Magni fi cation of errors
The original work on negative surveys assumes that UNSs can work well as long as participants report negative categories errors caused by the participants from category i is either or magni fi ed errors at category j , Er j , is: categories in a data collection. For example, a survey related to geographic information may have hundreds or thousands of categories, e.g., localities or stations in a city. 4. Gaussian negative surveys
We call our approach Gaussian negative surveys because the probabilities for selecting negative categories follow a Gaussian probability of reporting a negative category decreases when the negative category is further away from the positive category. 24.3%, 16.7% and 9% when j varies from 1 to 7. Similarly, a category is more likely to be reported by participants from nearby of the true statistic.

We use the collected counts in GNSs to solve aggregate queries without data reconstruction as in UNSs. GNSs' answers to categories, a major portion of the true counts within a query range are likely to be covered by the range. Second, although no different to each other. However, such situations rarely happen for spatial scenarios. An important observation of spatial approximating the spatial distribution. This makes GNSs particularly suitable for collecting aggregate spatial data. example of collecting aggregate data about passengers from 7 stations. positive category i report negative category j , Pr i , j , is computed as
Based on the sampled probabilities shown in Table 1 , we show the adjusted probabilities Pr i , j in Table 2 . When a GNS is modulated based on the adjusted probabilities, the total number of participants who report category j , r j ,is computing r j in Table 3 .
 query is
Based on the previous example, we compare the true answers and GNS's answers to aggregate queries in Table 4 , which shows that GNSs give a good approximation of the true answers.
 Under-counting happens when participants within the query range report categories outside the range. Over-counting happens between the two factors and the answers to range aggregate queries are presented in Theorem 1 .

Our theorem shows why GNSs can perform well for spatial data. As the spatial distribution of participants usually shows a is less likely to be small because range aggregate queries often cover a large number of categories, which may contain a considerable number of participants. Hence, t a  X  1 answer.

We also assume that there are c categories. We de fi ne A ={1, ... , c }  X  { i  X  1, i , i +1}.
Let t i , j be the number of participants who belong to category i but report category j . We get
Similarly, we can prove that
Hence, the true count of a category is distributed evenly in two adjacent categories when  X  is very small. That is,
We can deduct that
Hence,
Although GNSs can be applied to many types of data, the technique is particularly suitable for geo-spatial data because a categories in geo-spatial data. We conducted comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real geo-spatial data. The results highlight the advantages of GNSs in surveying this type of data. 4.1.

 tables before the survey. 4.2. Controlling privacy
We present two approaches to controlling the privacy levels of GNSs. Our fi rst approach controls privacy by customizing the positive category if the adversary knows the one-to-one mapping between the two types of categories. When there is a higher number of negative categories attached to a positive category, there would be a higher level of perceived privacy. Therefore,
Different to the fi rst approach, the second approach controls privacy by determining the systemic parameters of surveys. To the number of participants who are in category i but report category j is Pr i ; j  X  n c . We have the following formula. our example and thus approximately be constant. 5. Measuring privacy and accuracy 5.1. Privacy
We de fi ne a measure of privacy in GNSs. We do not measure the actual privacy level achieved by individuals based on k-anonymity. Anonymity-based metrics evaluate the privacy levels when people can report true sensitive information but want to de fi ne a metric that estimates the privacy levels of an individual without knowing the true data. We measure privacy based on the privacy level gained by all participants using this measure.
 category i report category j . The probability that a participant actually belongs to category i is We de fi ne the privacy level based on this probability: Let us see an example based on the probabilities shown in Fig.5 . Assume that a participant in category 3 reports category 1.
Since Pr k ,1 is 30.7%, 17.6%, 9%, 3.2%, 1.6% and 0.5% when k varies from 2 to 7, the privacy level of the participant is 5.2. Accuracy
We measure accuracy level from three aspects. First, we use the standard Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the denotes the estimated answer from negative surveys and t i denotes the true answer to the query. RMSE is de fi ned as:
Second, we measure Relative Accuracy (RA) based on the ratio of error to the true answer. We denote the true answer as t and the answer given by negative surveys as n . Formula 7 presents our de fi nition of RA. This measurement shows the relative Although the negative survey has an error of 500, the error is not signi fi cant compared to the true count, i.e., RA =95 % .
The above two metrics are for evaluating the accuracy of answers to range aggregate queries. In our experiments, we also the D-value for the two distributions in Fig.6 is 0.2857. 6. Experiments
We compare our proposed approach, GNSs, with the existing approach of negative surveys, UNSs. We also compare GNSs with a
We conduct experiments in one dimensional and two dimensional settings. The one dimensional settings simulate data data set. We then generate the collected data based on the true data set. For each of the surveys, we evaluate the similarity and position of the query ranges are randomly determined using an uniform distribution. Based on the answers to the queries, settings while keeping the other three parameters to the default settings. The parameters are de fi ned as follows.  X  number of cells in a grid partitioning of the space.  X  low value means that most participants would select negative categories that are close to the true categories, and vice versa.  X 
Query size : This is measured as the ratio between the number of categories in query range to the total number of categories.  X  for real 2D datasets. 6.1. Synthetic one dimensional datasets
For one dimensional settings, the true counts are generated from one of two common distributions: Gaussian distribution and simulating common scenarios where counts of participants do not change dramatically and remain constant across adjacent geographic areas. When the true distribution is Gaussian, we label the results from UNSs, GNSs and URRPs as UNS(G), GNS(G) and URRP(G), respectively. When the true distribution is uniform, we label the results from UNSs, GNSs and URRPs as UNS(U), GNS(U) and URRP(U), respectively. 6.1.1. Number of categories
We observe theadvantages of GNS over UNS withthe increase in thenumber of categories ( Fig.7 ). All approaches achieve 80% and 6.1.2. Standard deviation of GNSs
The shape of Gaussian distribution used by GNS is determined by the standard deviation. A small value of standard deviation parameter ( Fig.8 ). When the standard deviation increases, participants select negative categories from a wider range, which Privacy UNS(G) GNS(G) RA Privacy UNS(G) GNS(G) UNS(U) GNS(U) RA improves the privacy levels. GNS's relative accuracy decreases slowly when the standard deviation increases as the true counts become less likely to be distributed near the positive category. However, the results demonstrate that we can increase GNS's privacy level to 90.6% while maintaining accuracy level above 81.2%. The common data perturbation technique, URRP, achieves observe that GNS can approximate the original distribution well, no matter it is Gaussian or uniform. URRP and UNS cannot give close approximation of the original distribution, regardless of the shape of the distribution. 6.1.3. Query size
Fig.9 shows that GNS's RMSE is lower than UNS and URRP. GNS also achieves a signi fi cantly higher RA than both other when the original data is uniformly distributed. This indicates that the offset of errors from adjacent categories has more achieve high privacy levels and high accuracy levels at the same time. 6.1.4. Number of participants
For all approaches, RMSE increases when there are more participants ( Fig.10 ). GNS's RMSE grows at the slowest pace among all approaches. The relative accuracy of UNS and URRP increases with the growth of participants because the errors become less 76%, respectively. 6.2. Synthetic two dimensional datasets Our two dimensional settings simulate data collections in which the number of categories can be quite high. We use the probability of selecting a negative category is calculated in the same way as in one dimensional settings, but is based on the one or more cells.
Privacy RA Privacy UNS(G) GNS(G) UNS(U) GNS(U) RA 6.2.1. Number of categories Fig.11 shows the high privacy levels achieved by GNS. The accuracy levels of GNS are signi fi cantly better than UNS and URRP. This can be observed from the charts for RMSE, RA and D-value. For example, GNS's relative accuracy is between 87.3% and 94.8% collections if there are a high number of categories and a limited number of participants. URRP also performs poorly in such situations. 6.2.2. Standard deviation of GNSs
Fig.12 shows that GNS's privacy level rises with the increment of standard deviation as participants can select negative the results for one dimensional settings, GNS's privacy level is higher for the same standard deviation because there are a GNS over UNS and URRP in terms of accuracy. For example, GNS's D-value is never higher than 0.22 while both UNS and URRP stay at 0.54. 6.2.3. Query size growth of query size. GNS's RA is always higher than UNS and URRP by approximately 80%. As shown by the D-values, GNS always shows a more accurate spatial distribution of participants than UNS and URRP. 6.2.4. Number of participants show that GNS achieves a better balance between privacy and accuracy than UNS and URRP. 6.3. Real two dimensional datasets
Inthis section, we use a real2Ddataset to testGNSs. We usea datasetthatcontainsthe geo-locationsof General Practices Surgeries Privacy RA the negative data. Privacy RA Privacy RA 6.3.1. Number of categories
Fig.15 shows that all three approaches achieve high privacy levels, above 95%. Similar to what we observed in the experiment on synthetic datasets, the accuracy of GNS is better than UNS and URRP in most cases. For example, GNS's RMSE decreases from Privacy RA Privacy RA 2169 to 403 while UNS's RMSE increases from 1155 to 54,499. The relative accuracy of GNS is always above 72.7% and increases (37% and 45%). GNS is the only approach that constantly achieves high privacy levels and high accuracy levels. 6.3.2. Standard deviation of GNSs
Fig.16 shows that GNS's privacy level catches up with UNS when the standard deviation is 2 or higher. GNS's RMSE is lower by several orders of magnitude than UNS. GNS is also constantly more accurate than URRP in the answers to queries. For example, shows a more accurate distribution of original data than other approaches when its standard deviation is below 3. 6.3.3. Query size
When we change the query size, we also observe similar results as in synthetic data ( Fig.17 ). The privacy levels of three approaches are indistinguishable from each other. GNS shows signi fi cant advantage in RMSE and relative accuracy over UNS and
URRP. For example, GNS achieves 91.6% accuracy level while URRP only reaches 51.8% and UNS is 15.9% when the query size is 45% achieve high privacy levels and high accuracy levels at the same time. 7. Conclusion
This paper shows that the existing approach for negative surveys, i.e., Uniform Negative Surveys (UNSs), works fi ne for data collection with a small number of categories but with the increase of the number of categories, the collected data becomes work, we focus on collecting statistical spatial data, although for certain applications, detailed personal data might be more important than such aggregated data. We propose Gaussian Negative Surveys (GNSs). The novelty of GNSs lies in three aspects.
Third, we overcome the limit of survey scale in UNSs, which are only usable when there are a small number of categories. Our
UNS's RMSE by several orders of magnitude when there are a number of categories. While UNSs inherently achieve a high privacy level, the privacy level achieved by GNSs is close to UNSs. We also observe that GNSs are signi fi cantly more accurate than a Privacy RA GNSs used in our experiments are multi-variation Gaussian distributions in one dimensional and two dimensional settings.
