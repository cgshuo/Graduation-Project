 This paper defines the cross domain similarity mining (CDSM) problem, and motivates CDSM with several potential ap-plications. CDSM has big potential in (1) supporting un-derstanding transfer and (2) supporting research by anal-ogy, since similarity is vital to understanding/meaning and to identifying analogy, and since analogy is a fundamen-tal approach frequently used in hypothesis generation and in research. CDSM also has big potential in (3) advanc-ing learning transfer since cross domain similarities can shed light on how to best adapt classifiers/clusterings across given domains and how to avoid negative transfer. CDSM can also be useful for (4) solving the schema/ontology match-ing problem. Moreover, this paper gives a list of potential research questions for CDSM, and compares CDSM with re-lated studies. One purpose of this paper is to introduce the CDSM problem to the wide KDD community in order to quickly realize the full potential of CDSM. After giving a general definition of CDSM, this section dis-cusses (a) some similarity-revealing knowledge structures that can be mined by CDSM, (b) example datasets that can be considered as input to CDSM, and (3) some data preparation considerations for CDSM.
 Definition : The problem of cross domain similarity mining (CDSM) is, given two 1 datasets collected from two applica-tion domains, mine high-quality knowledge structures that capture structural level similarity between the two domains. The two datasets may or may not have class labels.
 Example kinds of knowledge structures that can cap-ture structural level similarities shared by two given datasets include shared decision trees, shared Bayesian models, shared

One can also consider CDSM for three or more datasets, which is omitted here to simplify the presentation. (hidden) Markov models, shared (linear) regression models, shared clusterings, shared conceptual clusterings with suc-cinct cluster descriptions, shared rankings of objects/concepts, shared attributes/schema fragments, etc. They also include the alignable-difference type of knowledge structures for two given domains, which contain substantial similarity parts shared by the two datasets and some difference parts unique for one of the two datasets. They can also be domain-specific knowledge structures, such as shared gene interac-tion networks and shared biological pathways for two dis-eases/organisms.
 Example datasets that can be used as input to CDSM in-clude two microarray datasets, perhaps with one for a well understood cancer and another for a poorly understood can-cer, or two sets of internet browsing histories for users from two countries, or two sets of DNA sequences for a binding site of interest for two bacteria, or two datasets for which one wishes to discover the kinds/properties of similarity patterns they share before selecting/applying learning transfer ap-proaches, or two heterogeneous databases that one wishes to integrate/combine, and so on. The two datasets can be het-erogeneous or homogeneous with respect to their attributes and classes.
 Whether data preparation , and what kinds of data prepa-ration, should be performed on the datasets used in CDSM is a decision that should be made in consultation with the domain experts depending on their goals. Data preparation may be needed if there are known cross domain differences in laboratory conditions and/or data collection technologies. Sometimes one may want to use various methods to provide likely, or even purely hypothetical , equivalence relationship between the classes, or between the attributes, of the two datasets, in order to discover similarity revealing knowledge structures based on the hypothetical equivalences in  X  X hat-if X  studies. Data mining methods may be needed to help discover various kinds of such equivalence relationships. CDSM has potential to be highly useful, since similarity-revealing knowledge structures can help support understand-ing transfer between a better understood domain and a poorly understood domain, support research by analogy to assist scientists to deal with a novel and complex research challenge and to form potential novel hypothesis, advance the field of learning transfer, and provide assistance in schema and ontology matching and integration. We discuss each of those applications in more detail here; other motivations and applications exist but are not discussed here. (1) Assisting users to transfer their understanding between domains . Consider this hypothetical scenario: Having studied a disease W extensively, John has expert knowledge on W , including how the key genes interact in W . Recently he started studying a new, poorly known, disease P . He examined some shared gene interaction relationships extracted from the two microarray gene expression datasets, D
W and D P , for the two diseases. A particular shared rela-tionship among three genes, g 3 , g 10 and g 18 , got his atten-tion. John X  X  experience on W tells him that the three genes play an important role in the development of W , occurring in a biological pathway important for W . Since that rela-tionship also occurs in P , John felt that those three genes may also be very important for P . He focused his effort on understanding the three genes for P and got rewarded. The shared relationship transferred John X  X  understanding of W to his understanding of P , helped improve his understanding of P and helped him form a new hypothesis on P . (2) Importance of analogy, and of similar structures for analogical reasoning/creative thinking . Observe that the result of a structural alignment process is typically a shared knowledge structure between two given domains. The main aim of CDSM is to mine shared knowl-edge structures efficiently, to help researchers find structural
Fauconnier [12] states:  X  Our conceptual networks are intri-cately structured by analogical and metaphorical mappings, which play a key role in the synchronic construction of mean-ing and in its diachronic evolution. Parts of such mappings are so entrenched in everyday thought and language that we do not consciously notice them; other parts strike us as novel and creative. The term metaphor is often applied to the lat-ter, highlighting the ... poetic aspects of the phenomenon.  X

In learning transfer [23], it is desirable to use available structure/knowledge of an auxiliary application domain to help build better classifiers/clusters for a target domain. However, sometimes when two given application domains share little structure in common, negative transfer can oc-cur, giving worse results when the auxiliary domain is used. One can use the mined shared knowledge structures to de-termine the amount and type of similarity between two given applications, and decide whether to use learning transfer. The usefulness of knowledge transfer between applications has been widely recognized in many application domains (including education, learning, cognitive sciences, biological sciences, business and economic development) and in the learning transfer area [23] of data mining/machine learning. (4) The similarity-type knowledge mined by CDSM can also be useful for solving the schema and ontology match-ing problem , which is an important issue for semantic web, data integration, data warehousing, etc. More details on schema and ontology matching is given in Section 4. There are many interesting research problems for CDSM. We discuss several below. 1. Mining various types of shared knowledge structures 2. Mining small diversified set of shared knowledge struc-3.

Extending the study to the Cross Domain Data Min-Studies on similarity measures : Due to the importance of similarity in many data-centric tasks, much has been done on studies on similarity measures. Such studies can be di-vided into three groups: We note that CDSM aims to mine similarity revealing knowl-edge structures in order to support understanding transfer, research by analogy, and learning transfer; it is not con-cerned with measuring similarity between objects, and it is not limited to measuring similarity between attributes or similarity between datasets.
 Studies on schema and ontology matching : Schema and ontology matching [27; 28; 18] is a fundamental prob-lem in many application domains, such as semantic web, schema and ontology integration, E-business, and data ware-housing. Typically, schema/ontology matching takes as in-put two schemas/ontologies, each consisting of a set of dis-crete entities (such as tables, XML elements, classes, proper-ties, rules, predicates), and determines various relationships (such as equivalence, subsumption) that hold between at-tributes or other fragments of the given entities. Sometimes data instances of the two schemas/ontologies [18] are also used as input for corpus-based schema matching, to help derive useful properties such as length and type of the do-main of an attribute.
 In some sense, CDSM can be viewed as a generalization of schema/ontology matching, since CDSM aims to mine simi-larity revealing knowledge structure beyond equivalence and subsumption relationships. It should be noted that the re-sults of CDSM can be utilized in solving the schema/ontology matching problem.
 Studies on learning transfer are mainly concerned with using knowledge extracted from auxiliary datasets to help build better knowledge structures in a target dataset/application. For example, one uses an auxiliary dataset to help build a classifier for a target dataset, which is more accurate than classifiers built without using auxiliary datasets. Reference [23] surveyed studies on learning transfer for classification, regression, and clustering; it categorized transfer learning under three main subsettings, namely inductive transfer learn-ing, transductive transfer learning, and unsupervised trans-fer learning. Importantly, the focus of learning transfer is to build better classifiers/clusterings on given target datasets. Unlike CDSM, learning transfer is not focused on mining (shared) knowledge structures, it is not aimed at helping human users to transfer understanding between application domains, and it is not aimed at assisting human users to better perform cross-domain analogy based reasoning and to better perform research by analogy. We note that CDSM has big potential in advancing learning transfer since cross domain similarities can shed light on how to best adapt clas-sifiers/clusterings across given domains and to avoid nega-tive transfer. The next paragraph discusses some other stud-ies on learning transfer that are more related to CDSM. Studies on knowledge structure transfer : Reference [6] considered structure transfer (also called  X  X eep trans-fer X ) for situations where source and target data are (i) from different domains/applications and (ii) described by different predicates. Reference [31] considered mining rules for cross-domain transfer. Both used cross-domain predi-cate/attribute mappings to capture  X  X quivalence X  between predicates/attributes; however, they did not focus on min-ing shared knowledge structures.
 Studies on shared decision tree mining : Reference [9] motivated and studied the problem of mining shared deci-sion trees across multiple datasets/applications. Two shared decision tree mining problems were studied, namely (a) min-ing shared decision trees with high shared accuracy (which is defined to be the minimum of the two accuracies of each given shared decision tree in the two datasets), and (b) min-ing shared decision trees with high shared accuracy and high data distribution similarity (which is based on the distribu-tion of the classes at the tree nodes). It was argued that mining results for the second problem are more useful. Algo-rithms were developed to solve both problems. Experimen-tal results on fifteen pairs of medical microarray datasets were reported to evaluate the algorithms, together with the mined shared decision trees. Future research questions on mining shared decision trees and other shared knowledge structures were discussed. Currently the authors of [9] are working on mining small diversified set of shared decision trees and some other related research questions.
 Examples of knowledge transfer have been discussed in many papers, including [17][25] concerning learning by analogy, [21][26][30] concerning task/procedure transfer, [7] concerning economic policy transfer, [29][22][19] concerning cross-species biological knowledge transfer, etc. This con-firms the importance of analogy and also shows that the importance of analogy is widely accepted. These papers are mostly about using knowledge transfer, but not about min-ing shared knowledge structures to assist knowledge trans-fer.
 Using structural mapping to find analogy : Reference [11] discussed how to find knowledge level analogy using tex-tual statements as input, but it did not use observation data as input and it did not consider conducting data mining to find analogy.
 Contrast data mining : The CDSM direction is related to contrast data mining and applications [10; 8]. Contrast data mining is concerned with mining patterns and models that contrast multiple classes/datasets/conditions; contrast pat-terns include emerging patterns [10] and contrast sets [1]. Loosely speaking, the studies on contrast mining and on shared knowledge structure mining all fall into the common theme of  X  X omparative mining of multiple classes/datasets.
