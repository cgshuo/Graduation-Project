 rapport with respondents, motivating respondents and asking questions which are complementary data collecting methods besides observing. Of particularly interesting with regard to developing rapport and motivating respondents is that the author recommended that  X  X esearchers should never rely on the fee to encourage openness X . The author suggested that there are many other reasons that make respondents willing to participate, for example seeking new experience, and recognition etc. As to data collection, the author suggested that during site visit, researchers should play the role of a na X ve outsider and expand the understanding of respondents by probing and interpreting body language. Finally in the data analysis and report-ing part the author recommended and compared five popular qualitative data analysis software and emphasized the impor-tance of interpreting the data. However, compared to the large portion of the book on how to design and implement an ethnography marketing project, too few have been devoted to the data interpretation part which is the most important part for decision making. This book should have considered providing more information on how to interpreting data with some examples.

This book, written by a leading marketing ethnography researcher, presents a comprehensive and structured introduction of conducing ethnography projects, from project design, participants recruiting to the final stage of data reporting and qual-ity review. One of the advantages of this book is that it reads easily and enjoyably for readers even having no prior knowl-edge about ethnography. Understanding consumers X  behavior and preference is especially important in the ever competitive market. The various dos and don X  X s provide practitioners and researchers a useful guideline. However, although being very useful, some shortcomings about ethnography should have been mentioned in this book. Only by understanding both the advantages and disadvantages of ethnography can readers make a right decision as to whether this methodology should be adopted or not.

In sum, this book is a pleasure to read. A coherent and structured presentation of the practices of an ethnography mar-keting research is presented. The vast amount of real world examples cited in this book make it especially easy for readers to follow and understand. This book fulfill its intended purpose of introducing and promoting the use of ethnography in mar-keting research, and thus It is suitable for both beginners and experienced practitioners of this field.

Creating Agile Business Systems with Reusable Knowledge, Amit Mitra, Amar Gupta. Cambridge University Press (2007). $110, Hardback, ISBN: 13 978-0-521-85163-3
This second edition of Mitra and Gupta X  X  book builds upon the ideas developed in the first edition that an agile business model should be based on the knowledge and rules used by a firm. The book lays the foundation of a new computing par-adigm in which computers manipulate meanings, not program code nor blind symbols and establishes a framework for the transfer and use of business knowledge in different contexts. It also describes the business intelligence, in components form, that technical standards must support. The book is co-authored by two prominent figures in the management and informa-tion technology (IT) field. Amit Mitra is Managing Consultant at Headstrong LLC, while Amar Gupta is professor of Entrepre-neurship and MIS at the University of Arizona, Tucson.

The 383 page book is organized into four chapters including  X  X  X n the nature of reality and the nature of business X  (Chapter 1),  X  X  X he object at the root of it all X  (Chapter 2),  X  X  X he nature of attributes X  (Chapter 3),  X  X  X omains and their expression X  (Chap-ter 4). These chapters are preceded by an introduction that provides readers with information about the scope, the structure and the audience of the book. Chapter 1 defines the structure of knowledge and its reuse in diverse scopes. Chapter 2 de-scribes how the object paradigm can encapsulate knowledge and automate its propagation through mechanisms such as inheritance, and how this is the basis for sharing and reusing knowledge in component form. Chapter 3 introduces config-urations and patterns that define constraints on business and object behaviors. Chapter 4 is probably the most important of the book if one refers to its length (almost half of the book length). This chapter develops and describes the concepts of pat-tern, measurability, and emphasizes the meaning of immeasurability. It addresses the spectrum of meanings that range from those that precisely quantify and measure numerically versus those that are purely qualitative.

The development of information and communication technology and especially the Internet, has brought about radical change in the business environment. New channels of supply and distribution of products are emerging. New electronic market-places and exchanges are being created. The infrastructures of firms and the industries within which they operate are constantly altered. Mitra and Gupta X  X  book seeks to address some of the challenges faced by business in the current infor-mation age. Mitra and Gupta believe, as mentioned in the preface of the book, that  X  X  X he pivotal issue in business computing lies in incorporating new learning in automated information systems; adding to what is already known and adapting auto-matically as perspectives and properties continuing change X  (p. xvii). In the current global networked economy where tech-nology has helped to reduce distances and to increase the availability of, agility and innovation are paramount for firms to achieve global excellence and customer value. Most current methods and practices in business process engineering tend to favor operational efficiency.

In addition, current computer based business information systems are not flexible enough to efficiently response to the constantly changing business environment. Mitra and Gupta X  X  book contributes to address this issue. It shows how innova-tion can be coded using normalized patterns of information. The book also shows how business processes and information systems could be tightly aligned. Moreover, the book provides insights on how these processes and systems can be designed to automatically adapt to change by re-configuring shared patterns of knowledge.

The authors present a modular approach to building business systems that parallels that of object oriented software. They describe how business knowledge can be identified, encapsulated, and shared, as well as how reusable process modules can be developed to offer the systems flexibility. The book provides practical templates required for accelerating integration, analysis, and design. Mitra and Gupta combine world class experience from industry with the best in academic experience and leading edge research.

The book provides useful insights on how to design business processes and systems that are both agile and adaptable, coordinate integration of information across supply chains and extended enterprises, reduce time-to-market, and improve computer aided systems engineering and computer aided process engineering tools. In addition, the book offers expert guid-ance on facilitating standards, prototyping for continuous improvement, designing enterprise information systems software, and achieving process maturity to rapidly absorb and utilize innovative technology for competitive advantage.
Creating Agile Business Systems with Reusable Knowledge is very technical and not an easy to read book for someone unfamiliar with recent development of technology in the business and management field. The book would be useful and very valuable to consultants, analysts, and managers in IT as well as researchers and graduate students in business, management and IT. I would recommend it especially for graduate students in the current new emerging I-schools.
 Caribbean Libraries in the 21st Century; Changes, Challenges, and Choices, Shamin Renwick, Cheryl Peltier-Davis (Eds.). Information Today Inc. (2007). xxv+387pp.,  X 24.50; US $49.50, Hardbound, ISBN: 978-1-57387-301-7
With a growing myriad of formats available for storing and retrieving information, it was only a matter of time before a book like Caribbean Libraries in the 21st Century was published. This book explores, not only in breadth but in depth, a mul-titude of issues that are affecting libraries in the Caribbean region. In eight sections and 25 chapters, it speaks to not only the concerns and efforts being put forth by librarians and library personnel, but also about their experiences. This review will provide a summary of each of the book X  X  eight parts (a compilation of articles from 41 professionals) followed by an analysis of the book as a whole. It will also discuss the intended audience for Caribbean Libraries in the 21st Century and its suitability for alternative purposes.

Part I , titled  X  X  X istorical Perspective X , consists of four chapters. These chapters are similar in that they discuss the devel-opment of Caribbean libraries across different formats (public and national, school and academic, and special). Essentially, they focus on the evolution and sustainability of Caribbean libraries. Part I discusses the struggles of establishing an efficient library space and the manner in which libraries have evolved  X  from unprofessional libraries run out of homes, to the  X  X ook van X  or  X  X ookmobile X , and now to being in electronic environments. This section of the book discusses the training that was not only required, but desired by library officials, as well as the challenges that have been faced and will continue to be faced. The various issues of culture and language, technological developments, accessibility, as well as finances and politics are also discussed. The bottom-line of this section is that,  X  X  X ooperation between library organizations at home and abroad is a necessary requirement for the survival of the libraries X  (p. 40).  X  X  X ooperative ventures have benefited libraries and librar-ians over the years, and a renewed commitment in this area is even more crucial to providing timely and easy access to information for library patrons X  (p. 49).
