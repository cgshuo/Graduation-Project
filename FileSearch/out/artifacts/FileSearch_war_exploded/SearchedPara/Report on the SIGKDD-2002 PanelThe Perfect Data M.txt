 SIGKDD Expl oration s . Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 110 Comm ercial and aca demic data mining too ls range from being fully automated to h ighly interactive. We will discuss the role of hu man involvement in the data mining process. On the on e hand , providing interactivity/visualization enables do main kno wledge transfer and the use of the hu man X  X  perceptual capabiliti es. On the other hand , the vast amoun t of data to b e mined tod ay makes real -time interactivity hard to achieve a nd unn ece ssarily bu rdens the user to p erform tasks that may be don e a utomatically. Question s to b e discussed includ e: What are the id eal roles of the c ompu ter and o f the user in the data mining process? Which d ata mining method s (clustering, classification , association rules,...) can b e improved b y more hu man involvement? What kind o f app lication s requ ires more hu man involvement? What kin d o f app lication s requ ires littl e or no hu man involvement? The panel was organized b y Mihael Ankerst (The Boeing Company) and the participants were Surajit Chaudu ri (Microsoft Research), Georges Grinstein (University of Massachu setts Lowell &amp; AnVil, Inc.) , Jiawei Han (University of Illino is at Urbana -Champaign), and Gregory Piatetsky -Shapiro (KD nu ggets). Anyon e who h as ever used a c ompu ter kno ws that i nteractive too ls are ind ispensable. But, that is different from saying that generic data visualization too ls are very effective for data mining. I think that while they are useful, they do no t help u s s olve ou r primary challenge in mining enterprise data. Enterprise data is s plit across many tables and the most diffic ult t ask is s pecifying the qu ery/view that defines the relevant data over which d ata mining is don e. Specifying such qu eries/views requ ires app lication kno wledge. Try visualizing Wal Mart X  X  Data Warehou se to find trend s withou t preprocessing! Getting rid o f the hu man in the loop ? Wron g decision ! For the last deca de I have a rgued for an increase in hu man participation throu gh visualization in the data e xploration and kno wledge discovery processes. At first there was resistance from the AI comm un ity. After all, compu tation is precise a nd hu mans imprecise. The AI and especially the KDD comm un ity later SIGKDD Expl oration s . Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 111 based on the preliminary mining results. This s hou ld b e don e in a highly interactive mann er. Visualize results, no t the data! The hu man eye is an excellent too l for spo tting natural patterns. Much p r ogress has been made in d evelop ing v ery po werful visualization too ls that allow many, perhaps too many, types of visualization . However, when visualization is used as a part of manu ally, the visua lization too ls are frequ ently too complex. The most po werful visualization s are very complex to und erstand , bu rden the user with too many cho ices, and requ ire lon g and special training.
 We a rgue that t he goal shou ld b e to simplify visualization as much as po ssible to h elp hu mans make more acc urate decision s. Less effort shou ld b e spent on visualizing data, and more on visualizing the results of data mining and h elping the users to und erstand them. The visualization too ls s hou ld no t con fuse a n average use r with an o verwhelming set of cho ices for visualization . Instead, they shou ld guide the user towards the most app rop riate visualization s for the task. A po ssible lon g -term goal cou ld b e to get rid o f visualization altogether and to automate the decision p r ocess. Some statements from the slides of the panelists:
