 First Story Detection (FSD) systems aim to identify those news ar-ticles that discuss an event that was not reported before. Recent work on FSD has focussed almost exclusively on efficiently de-tecting documents that are dissimilar from their nearest neighbor. We propose a novel FSD approach that is more effective, by adapt-ing a recently proposed method for news summarization based on 3-nearest neighbor clustering. We show that this approach is more effective than a baseline that uses dissimilarity of an individual doc-ument from its nearest neighbor.
Internet users are turning more frequently to online news as a re-placement for traditional media sources such as newspapers or tele-vision. For the user, the news stream is a source to both track topics of interest and to become informed about important new events the user was not yet aware of. Automated detection of new events can save to user a great deal of time, for instance by notifying users about new events, which is especially interesting to users and orga-nizations for whom the information is time-critical and who need to act on that information.

FSD systems aim to identify those news articles that discuss an event that was not reported before in earlier stories, without knowl-edge of what events will happen in the news [2]. Recently, FSD has been suggested as a useful tool to monitor the Twitter feed [7], and while previous work has addressed the efficiency that is required for this purpose, there has been little work on improving the effec-tiveness in over a decade [7, 8].

In this study, we propose a novel approach that is more effective that the widely used function proposed by Allen et al. that declares a story new if it is dissimilar to its nearest neighbor [1].
The task of detecting events can be automated using informa-tion about the events published online. For this purpose, the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) program was initiated to discuss ap-plications and techniques to organize broadcast news stories by the real world events that they discuss in real-time. News stories are gathered from several sources in parallel to create a single stream of constantly arriving news. The problem of first story detection is to identify the stories in a stream of news that contain discussion of a new topic, i.e. whose event has not been previously reported [6].
FSD has been recognized as the most difficult task in the research area of TDT [11]. In early work, Allen et al. detect first stories as news articles whose cosine similarity over tf-idf vectors to its near-est neighbor is less than a threshold, an effective approach that out-performs complex language model approaches in most cases [1]. This baseline is still used for FSD in recent work, in which more focus is put on efficiency than to improve effectiveness [3, 5, 4].
Papka and Allen, argue that a side-effect of the timely nature of broadcast news is that stories closer together on the news stream are more likely to discuss related topics than stories farther apart on the stream. When a significant new event occurs, there are usually sev-eral stories per day discussing it; over time, coverage of old events is displaced by more recent events. They use temporal proximity as a distinguishing feature to incorporate the salient properties of broadcast news [2, 6].

In recent work, Vuurens et al. proposed a novel 3-nearest neigh-bor clustering (3NN) approach to retrieve sentences from news ar-ticles that contain novel and useful news facts. In this approach every text is linked to its three nearest neighbors that must be from a different domain [10]. The so-called  X 2-degenerate cores X  con-structed by the algorithm correspond to highly similar texts from three different sources. Their existence indicates the importance or salience of the information contained. Temporal proximity is incor-porated in the model by weighting the time between news articles in the similarity function used. In [9] normalized information gain is shown to be more effective than cosine similarity for the task of clustering news articles that are topically related. In this work, we adapt the 3NN clustering approach to First Story Detection, by clustering news articles rather than sentences, and using a similarity function based on normalized information gain to promote the clustering of news articles that are likely to be topically related.
We compare our efforts to the approach described by Allen et al. [1], which is considered a state-of-the-art approach in recent studies on First Story Detection, e.g. [7, 4]. In this approach, doc-uments are represented as tf-idf weighted vectors, and the novelty of a document d is estimated by the cosine similarity to its nearest neighbor n in the collection C [1]:
Then, a news article is marked as a first story when its novelty is below a threshold  X   X  [ 0 , 1 ] .
In this study, we propose a novel approach that is based on 3-nearest neighbor clustering (3NN), using the existing open source implementation [10]. In 3NN clustering, every node is assigned to its three nearest neighbors, not allowing links between nodes from the same news domain, and based on temporal proximity be-tween publication dates which allows the clustering to be continu-ously updated in near real-time. 2-generate cluster cores are formed when three nodes each link to the other two as a one of its 3 nearest neighbors. These clusters contain information that is locally most central and therefore likely to be salient information [10]. The key idea for First Story Detection, is that acting on formed 3NN clusters rather than individual documents is less likely to return false posi-tives. However, instead of truly detecting the first story as was the objective in the TDT program, here we aim to improve detection performance at the expense of slightly delayed detection. It may also be that the story detected as the first of a new event is more central to the information, and therefore more suitable as a seed to start tracking a topic, however, this hypothesis is outside the scope of this study and left for future work.

In [9], news sentences were fitted into a hierarchy that distin-guishes between different events and topics by forming clusters of topically related the news articles, for which normalized informa-tion gain was shown to be more effective than cosine similarity. Therefore, to promote 3NN clusters to be formed around topically related news articles we use a similarity function based on normal-ized information gain. In Equation 2, the normalized information gain between two documents d and d 0 results in a score of 0 be-tween identical documents and a score of 1 between disjoint docu-ments, by dividing the information gain IG between the documents by an upper bound of the information gain IG max that would be ob-tained if these documents have the same internal distributions over terms but are completely disjoint. For the remainder of this pa-per we use IG sim as defined in Equation 3 as a similarity function between two documents d , d 0 based on IG norm .

From the obtained 3NN clustering, the newly formed 2-degenerate cores are inspected for first stories. Similar to the Single Linkage baseline, first stories are detected when a newly formed cluster core is dissimilar from news articles seen recently. In 3NN every news article is linked to its three nearest neighbors, therefore the mem-bers of a newly formed 2-degenerate core that contains a first story each have two links to the other core members and the third link links to a dissimilar news article. The most similar non-core news article that a core member links to, is then used to estimate the nov-elty of that cluster core. Formally, in Equation 4 a cluster core A is declared novel when the similarity between a news article d  X  A and a news article n in the remainder of the collection C is below a threshold  X  novelty .
Lastly, we add a threshold to filter out newly formed clusters that are less likely to be topically related to each other. Vuurens et al. show that news articles that have a high normalized information gain are rarely topically related [9]. Following their findings, we fil-ter out clusters that fail the coherence criterium in Equation 5, that enforces that the similarity between all nodes d , d 0 that are mem-bers of the same 2-degenerate core A exceeds a threshold  X  for which different settings are tried to examine the sensitivity and impact on effectiveness. coherence ( A ) = min
For the evaluation, we use the TREC Temporal Summarization test sets of 2013 and 2014. The corpus for these test sets is the 2013 TREC KBA Streaming corpus, which contains approx. 150M news articles that are processed in a strict online setting. Table 1 shows the topics from the test sets, which are all types of a crisis that received continuous updates in the media over time. Arguably, the news regarding a single topic could be considered to be all part of the same story, or in some cases be regarded as separate stories within a topic. Here we regard all news articles that are matched to the same topic as part of one news story, for which ideally only the first article should be returned. TREC assessors annotated the sen-tences that TREC participants retrieved as relevant if they contain a news fact relevant to the topic.

The basis for the evaluation of the FSD systems is a list per topic of all documents that contain relevant news facts according to the TREC ground truth or the online published extended lists that con-tain duplicate sentences found in the collection. For the combined 23 topics, there are 65,358 documents that were annotated as con-taining relevant information. For this task, a returned news article is considered as a first for a topic when it is the first relevant article returned by the system, and a false alarm when another relevant ar-ticle for the same topic was returned earlier. News articles that are not marked as relevant to the topic are ignored in the evaluation.
The effectiveness of First Story Detection systems is measured by the miss rate, false alarm rate, recall and precision, which we explain using the contingencies in Table 2. For any topic, we only consider articles that are annotated as relevant for the topic, thus if T is the number of documents annotated as relevant for the topic, then TP + FN + FP + TN = T . Since there can only be one first story per topic per system, TP + FN = 1 and FP + TN = T  X  1. A miss occurs when the system fails to detect a new event, i.e. miss rate = FN TP + FN . A false alarm occurs when the system emits a news article when a first story was already emitted for that topic, i.e. false alarm rate = FP FP + TN . Recall is the fraction of topics for which a first story was detected Recall = TP TP + FN , and Preci-Precision = TP TP + FP , which here only considers the news articles that are relevant to the topic.

In this Section, we compare the effectiveness of first story detec-tion using Single Linkage (SL) to FSD using 3NN.
In Figure 1, a DET curve shows the relationship between miss rate and false alarm rates. Overall, the 3NN runs perform better than SL, regardless of the setting used for  X  coherence . In Figure 2, we show a tradeoff between recall and precision, which further sup-ports that 3NN is consistently more effective than Single Linkage. Table 3 gives the precision and false alarm rate when the novelty thresholds for both systems are set to the highest precision that can be obtained at recall = 1. When  X  = 0 . 48 and  X  novelty set to allow for the lowest false alarm rate at a missed rate of 0 (i.e. recall=1), precision is respectively 0.0149 for SL and 0.0618 for 3NN, meaning that SL more redundantly retrieves 4 times more news articles for the same event.

In Figure 3, the y-axis shows the aggregated number of relevant news articles per hour over time on the x-axis. In this Figure, we can visually compare the moment a first story was detected against the volume of published news articles. We can see that the sys-tems occasionally missed early detection, e.g. 3NN for topic 3, and Single Linkage for topic 9. On topic 12, detection may be late for 3NN, but there is a difficult tradeoff between early detection and a lower false alarm rate. Figure 1: Detection Error Tradeoff curve, closer to the origin is better. Figure 2: Plotted point show the Recall/Precision that correspond to the systems X  effectiveness at the given threshold.

Some topics are related to an incident that is followed by a quick burst (e.g. topic 1), while other topics initially have a phase of little media attention and have intervals of increased interest later in time (e.g. topic 16). An interesting case is topic 18, which concerns the demonstrations that followed the Russian elections. For this topic, the news slowly shifted over the cause of days from a focus on the election itself to the steadily increasing demonstrations. This gradual shift towards a new topic is relatively difficult to detect for the approaches used in this study. The effective detection of these types of event may require a novel FSD approach that is not solely based on dissimilarity.

An inspection on the timeliness of the first stories detected re-veals weaknesses in both approaches, and potentially an important aspect that should be taken into consideration in attempts to im-prove FSD. Timeliness of the detection is currently not addressed by the traditional evaluations that use a DET-curve and the trade-off between recall and precision. To evaluate future work that ad-dresses this issue, an additional metric to compare the timeliness of FSD approaches is required. In this study, we propose a novel approach for the task of First Story Detection based on clustering news articles that are likely to be topically related, and estimating the novelty of newly formed clusters by comparison to previously seen news articles. We com-pared this approach to a baseline that estimates the novelty of a single news article by the cosine similarity to its nearest neigh-bor. The evaluation shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing baseline both in tradeoff between missed first stories and false positives, and in tradeoff between recall and precision. An analysis of the timeliness of the first story detections revealed that both systems missed early detection on some cases, and that there are specific cases such as evolving events that are particularly hard to detect.
