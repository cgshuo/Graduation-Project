 decades . Early researchers annotated each i mage i n an i mage database that used s i ze of the databases has become larger and larger and d i fferent people may g i ve the same i mage d i fferent keywords .

Beyond the typ i cal text-based i mage retr i eval methods, content-based i mage v i sual contents through automat i cally extracted features, such as color, shape, texture, match i ng, semant i c categor i zat i on, and so on, for example, QBIC, ImageRover, i mprove the performance of CBIR based on color features, several extended methods i mage by a color h i stogram for model i ng the color spat i al i nformat i on [1, 7] .
Str i cker and D i ma i spl i t a color i mage i nto an oval central reg i on and four corner sub-i mages . They evaluated and comb i ned the color feature s i m i lar i ty of each of these sub-i mages . The central reg i on ga i ned more we i ght when a s i m i lar i ty was noted [16] . measurements to enhance the CBIR system X  X  effect i veness . They descr i bed the i mage i n the CIELAB color space w i th two palettes [8] . Kuo et al . used the mean, standard features of an i mage [12] . However, CBIR system only based on color cannot suff i ce to i ndex large and constancy i mage databases . We need to comb i ne color w i th other features to handle modern databases [11, 14, 15] . Chan and L i u, then, proposed a CBIR system based on CDESSO features [4] . The system used color d i fferences among ad j acent ob j ects as the local features of a color i mage to i ncrease the retr i eval accuracy of the i mage retr i eval method .

In th i s paper, we adopt another local i nformat i on --b i tmap (BM), wh i ch i s obta i ned from an i mage compress i on method, Block truncat i on cod i ng (BTC), as a feature for transm i ss i on, i mage process i ng, and so on . The BTC method uses the propert i es, the results obta i ned, and f i nally, Sect i on 6 prov i des the conclus i ons . Chan and L i u proposed the CDESSO-based method i n 2002 [2, 4] . They used k i nds of color spaces of a p i xel . In order to reduce the color spaces, the method f i rst between any two cont i nued p i xels was computed . Let each cluster have i ts own b i n to record the d i fference .

The scann i ng process beg i ns from the central p i xel of the i mage i n a sp i ral scann i ng p i xel, the color d i fference between two p i xels would be added to the correspond i ng b i n . The d i fference i s g i ven by are the CDESSO features of the i mage . The ma i n weakness of the CBIR methods i s lack of spat i al i nformat i on . Hence, Chen and L i u used the CDESSO features as local paper, we use another feature  X  common b i tmap (CBM) as the local i nformat i on to enhance the i mage retr i eval method X  X  effect i veness . than the mean value of the block, and the rest of the p i xels are represented by a 1-b i t . For example, assume a gray-level i mage i s d i v i ded i nto several blocks each w i th 4  X  4 p i xels . One of the blocks i s shown i n the f i gure below . each p i xel value w i th the mean value to construct the BM, wh i ch i s shown i n F i g . 3 .
The BTC method uses the BM, the mean and standard dev i at i on to represent and reconstruct an i mage . We can see that the mean and the standard dev i at i on propert i es, s i m i lar i mage retr i eval method .
 and BM of an i mage as features to represent an i mage . 4.1 The Color D i str i but i on Feature Each i mage i n an i mage database may be d i fferent from all the others, but at the same s i ze M  X  N i n an i mage database . The i mage i s wr i tten as 
In th i s paper, each i mage i s represented i n RGB color space . That means each p i xel can be i nterpreted as a vector by pr i mary colors red (R), green (G), and blue (B) . Let c represent a vector i n RGB color space where the components of c (x, y) are the RGB components of a color i mage at the i mage are determ i ned as follows respect i vely . In the above equat i on, of  X  are the mean values of the RGB components of a color i mage . Meanwh i le, the components of  X  are the standard dev i at i ons .
 same color d i str i but i on, may be treated as s i m i lar i mages . Therefore, we need another feature to enhance retr i eval accuracy . 4.2 The Common B i tmap (CBM) Feature We cons i der another feature, common b i tmap (CBM), for enhancement purpose . The overlapp i ng blocks . Let } B , , B , B { B represented as 
In the above equat i on, n m x 1  X   X   X  , b( i , j ) i s the p i xel value at the correspond i ng by compute the mean value for each block . Let computed us i ng the express i on where components of the block . F i nally, compute CBM for the i mage . Let CBM of the i mage . Each component i n T be expressed as: respect i vely g i ven by 
The overall features used to represent an i mage are (  X  ,  X  , T) . 4.3 An Example extract the color d i str i but i on feature of F . The mean value  X  and standard dev i at i on s of F are blocks, w i th each block hav i ng 16 p i xels, where m = n = 4 . Then, compute the mean values for these blocks . We have  X   X   X   X   X  Therefore, the features of F are (  X  ,  X  , T) = ( 4.4 The S i m i lar i ty Measure of the Features i s used for compar i ng  X  and  X  , and the second i s hamm i ng d i stance, wh i ch used for become mean i ngless because the magn i tude s i m i lar i ty value may dom i nate the others . The features  X  and  X  of an i mage are respect i vely normal i zed as follows database that i s g i ven by g i ven by Further, the symbol  X  i n Eq . 11 i s the mean value of whole  X  i n the i mage database that i s g i ven by where i  X  i s the standard dev i at i on of the i th i mage . Another symbol  X  i s the standard dev i at i on value of whole  X  that i s g i ven by Hence, the s i m i lar i ty measure between two i mages A and B i s calculated as follows: 
In the above equat i on, funct i on H i s used to compute the hamm i ng d i stance between i mages A and B that i s def i ned as  X  X  The symbol A k i T i s the i th component of the common b i t map T i n k color of i mage A and k  X  {R, G, B} . In add i t i on, the symbol A k  X   X  i s the normal i zed mean value of A features of E are (
After be i ng normal i zed, the f i nal features of E and F are (  X   X   X   X   X  between i mages F and E i s computed as In order to test the performance of our proposed method, three ex i st i ng algor i thms are used to benchmark the proposed method . The f i rst one i s color h i stogram . The second i s color moment . The th i rd i s CDESSO-based method [4] . In th i s paper, we performed two d i fferent exper i ments to compare the performance of the three algor i thms and our proposed method . The f i rst one i s to test the retr i eval accurac i es of the methods, and another i s to test the category query ab i l i ty of the methods . 5.1 The Retr i eval Accuracy Q , where each database conta i ns 410 full color an i mat i ons [4] . Each i mage i n Q 1 has i ts correspond i ng i mage from Q 1 i n (b) .

The second i mage database conta i ned two i mage databases D 2 and Q 2 , where each  X  and N retr i eves the des i red i mage .

The retr i eval accuracy (R) of the method i s g i ven by the express i on i n the exper i mental results, when block s i zes are 5  X  5 and 10  X  10, the proposed method would have approx i mate results that are better than 15  X  15 . Therefore, i n the follow i ng the number of blocks i s 100 (m  X  n = 10  X  10), the proposed method would have better retr i eval accuracy than other methods i n both Q 1 and Q 2 databases .
 wh i ch were collected from [10, 13, 17] and were used to explore the retr i eval embedded i nto D 3 . When us i ng an i mage from Q 2 as a query, the goal was to retr i eve the correspond i ng i mage, wh i ch i s the target i mage i n D 2 , from D 3 .
The exper i mental results are shown i n Table 3 . For N RT = 10, the proposed method w i th 10  X  10 blocks has better result than others . In other words, the retr i eval accuracy i s 55 . 32%, wh i le the retr i eval accuracy of the color h i stogram and color moment are proposed method w i th block s i ze of 10  X  10 i s 76 . 6%, wh i ch i s h i gher than that of the performances of the methods are shown i n F i g . 8 .
Method 5.2 The Category Retr i eval Prec i s i on of the same theme can be regarded as belong i ng to the same category . The ten categor i es are arch i tecture (A), c i ty (C), dog (D), eagle (E), elephant (El), leopard (L), was to retr i eve i mages belong i ng to the same category as query i mages from a database . Therefore, every i mage from these ten categor i es was used as query i mages . For each query, other i mages belong i ng to the same category were regarded as the correspond i ng target i mages . The performance of the category ab i l i ty (P) i s measured by: P = C r / N RT , where Cr i s the number of i mages belong i ng to the same category as proposed method and other methods are shown i n Table 4 . The column Cr i n the table shows the average number of Cr i n each category . For example, for category C i ty, the proposed method found 12 relevant i mages wh i le the color h i stogram d i d not f i nd any relevant i mages, and color moment scheme only found 2 relevant i mages, for N RT = 30 . The correspond i ng prec i s i ons are 40%, 0%, and 6%, respect i vely .
 query i mage . F i g . 11 shows a query i mage conta i n i ng royals of red and black colors . query i mages . F i g . 12 shows the aggregated results over all ten categor i es . Accord i ng the category ab i l i ty i n most cases . 5.3 Memory Space Analys i s h i stogram for stor i ng the features of database i mages i s |D|  X  64 (clusters)  X  3 (RGB) method i s |D|  X  64 (clusters)  X  4 bytes (a float i ng po i nt) . However, the memory space of our proposed method i s |D|  X  [ space of a color h i stogram method i n D 1 i s 410  X  64  X  3  X  3  X  4 = 944,640 (bytes), meanwh i le, CDESSO-based method i s 410  X 64  X  4 = 104,960 (bytes) . However, the memory space of our method w i th block s i zes 10  X  10 only takes 410  X  [  X  4] = 25,215 (bytes) . Content-based i mage retr i eval has become one of the most act i ve research areas i n the recently decade . In th i s paper, we i ntroduced a method for content-based i mage i mage may i gnore the spat i al layout of the i mage . Thus, the common b i tmap was used character i st i cs .

The proposed method can retr i eve i mages rang i ng from purely ob j ects, such as an exper i mental results, the proposed method has better performances for retr i eval of i mages i n the categor i es of eagle, elephant, leopard, mounta i n and royal . In add i t i on, the total memory space for sav i ng the i mage features of the proposed method i s less than other methods .
