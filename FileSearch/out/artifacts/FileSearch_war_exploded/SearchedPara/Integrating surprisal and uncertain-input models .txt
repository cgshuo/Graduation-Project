 In most formal theories of human sentence compre-hension, input recognition and syntactic analysis are taken to be distinct processes, with the only feed-back from syntax to recognition being prospective prediction of likely upcoming input (Jurafsky, 1996; Narayanan and Jurafsky, 1998, 2002; Hale, 2001, 2006; Levy, 2008a). Yet a system making optimal use of all available information might be expected to perform fully joint inference on sentence identity and structure given perceptual input, using linguistic knowledge both prospectively and retrospectively in drawing inferences as to how raw input should be segmented and recognized as a sequence of linguis-tic tokens, and about the degree to which each input token should be trusted during grammatical analysis. Formal models of such joint inference over uncer-tain input have been proposed (Levy, 2008b), and corroborative empirical evidence exists that strong coherence of current input with a perceptual neigh-bor of previous input may induce confusion in com-prehenders as to the identity of that previous input (Connine et al., 1991; Levy et al., 2009).

In this paper we explore a more dramatic predic-tion of such an uncertain-input theory: that, when faced with sufficiently biasing input, comprehen-ders might under some circumstances adopt a gram-matical analysis inconsistent with the true raw in-put comprising a sentence they are presented with, but consistent with a slightly perturbed version of the input that has higher prior probability. If this is the case, then subsequent input strongly disconfirm-ing this  X  X allucinated X  garden-path analysis might be expected to induce the same effects as seen in classic cases of garden-path disambiguation tradi-tionally studied in the psycholinguistic literature. We explore this prediction by extending the ratio-nal uncertain-input model of Levy (2008b), integrat-ing it with SURPRISAL THEORY (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008a), which successfully accounts for and quan-tifies traditional garden-path disambiguation effects; and by testing predictions of the extended model in a self-paced reading study. Section 2 reviews surprisal theory and how it accounts for traditional garden-path effects. Section 3 provides background infor-mation on garden-path effects relevant to the current study, describes how we might hope to reveal com-prehenders X  use of grammatical knowledge to revise beliefs about the identity of previous linguistic sur-face input and adopt grammatical analyses incon-sistent with true input through a controlled experi-ment, and informally outlines how such belief revi-sions might arise as a side effect in a general the-ory of rational comprehension under uncertain in-put. Section 4 defines and estimates parameters for a model instantiating the general theory, and describes the predictions of the model for the experiment de-scribed in Section 3 (along with the inference proce-dures required to determine those predictions). Sec-tion 5 reports the results of the experiment. Section 6 concludes. The SURPRISAL THEORY of incremental sentence-processing difficulty (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008a) posits that the cognitive effort required to process a given word w the simple information-theoretic measure of the log of the inverse of the word X  X  conditional probability (also called its  X  X urprisal X  or  X  X hannon information content X ) in its intra-sentential context w extra-sentential context Ctxt : (In the rest of this paper, we consider isolated-sentence comprehension and ignore Ctxt .) The the-ory derives empirical support not only from con-trolled experiments manipulating grammatical con-text but also from broad-coverage studies of read-ing times for naturalistic text (Demberg and Keller, 2008; Boston et al., 2008; Frank, 2009; Roark et al., 2009), including demonstration that the shape of the relationship between word probability and reading time is indeed log-linear (Smith and Levy, 2008).
Surprisal has had considerable success in ac-counting for one of the best-known phenomena in (Frazier, 1979), in which a local ambiguity biases the comprehender X  X  incremental syntactic interpre-tation so strongly that upon encountering disam-biguating input the correct interpretation can only be recovered with great effort, if at all. The most famous example is (1) below (Bever, 1970): where the context before the final word is strongly biased toward an interpretation where raced is the main verb of the sentence ( MV ; Figure 1a), the in-tended interpretation, where raced begins a reduced relative clause ( RR ; Figure 1b) and fell is the main verb, is extremely difficult to recover. Letting T range over the possible incremental syntactic analy-ses of words w conditional probability of the disambiguating con-tinuation fell can be approximated as For all possible predisambiguation analyses T either the analysis is disfavored by the context (
P ( T j | w 1 ... 6 ) is low) or the analysis makes the disambiguating word unlikely ( P ( fell | T low). Since every summand in the marginalization of Equation (I) has a very small term in it, the total marginal probability is thus small and the surprisal is high. Hale (2001) demonstrated that surprisal thus predicts strong garden-pathing effects in the classic sentence The horse raced past the barn fell on ba-sis of the overall rarity of reduced relative clauses alone. More generally, Jurafsky (1996) used a com-bination of syntactic probabilities (reduced RCs are rare) and argument-structure probabilities ( raced is usually intransitive) to estimate the probability ratio of the two analyses of pre-disambiguation context in Figure 1 as roughly 82:1, putting a lower bound on the additional surprisal incurred at fell for the reduced-RC variant over the unreduced variant ( The We now move on to cases where garden-pathing can apparently be blocked by only small changes to the surface input, which we will take as a starting point for developing an integrated theory of uncertain-input inference and surprisal. The backdrop is what is known in the psycholinguistic literature as the NP/Z ambiguity, exemplified in (2) below: In incremental comprehension, the phrase the socks is ambiguous between being the NP object of the preceding subordinate-clause verb mending versus being the subject of the main clause (in which case mending has a Z ero object); in sentences like (2) the initial bias is toward the NP interpreta-tion. The main-clause verb fell disambiguates, rul-ing out the initially favored NP analysis. It has been known since Frazier and Rayner (1982) that this effect of garden-path disambiguation can be measured in reading times on the main-clause verb (see also Mitchell, 1987; Ferreira and Henderson, 1993; Adams et al., 1998; Sturt et al., 1999; Hill and Murray, 2000; Christianson et al., 2001; van Gompel and Pickering, 2001; Tabor and Hutchins, 2004; Staub, 2007). Small changes to the context can have huge effects on comprehenders X  initial in-terpretations, however. It is unusual for sentence-initial subordinate clauses not to end with a comma or some other type of punctuation (searches in the parsed Brown corpus put the rate at about 18%); em-pirically it has consistently been found that a comma eliminates the garden-path effect in NP/Z sentences: Understanding sentences like (3) is intuitively much easier, and reading times at the disambiguating verb are reliably lower when compared with (2). Fodor (2002) summarized the power of this effect suc-cinctly: In a surprisal model with clean, veridical input, Fodor X  X  conclusion is exactly what is predicted: sep-arating a verb from its direct object with a comma effectively never happens in edited, published writ-ten English, so the conditional probability of the NP analysis should be close to zero. 2 When uncer-tainty about surface input is introduced, however X  due to visual noise, imperfect memory representa-tions, and/or beliefs about possible speaker error X  analyses come into play in which some parts of the true string are treated as if they were absent. In particular, because the two sentences are perceptual neighbors, the pre-disambiguation garden-path anal-ysis of (2) may be entertained in (3).

We can get a tighter handle on the effect of input uncertainty by extending Levy (2008b) X  X  analysis of the expected beliefs of a comprehender about the se-quence of words constituting an input sentence to joint inference over both sentence identity and sen-tence structure. For a true sentence perceptual input I , joint inference on sentence iden-tity where P tual inputs derived from the true sentence) and P terms reflect the comprehender X  X  linguistic knowl-edge and beliefs about the noise processes interven-ing between intended sentences and perceptual in-put. given I since der, giving us (through Bayes X  Rule):
For present purposes we constrain the comprehen-der X  X  model of noise so that T and I are condition-ally independent given simplification to
That is, a comprehender X  X  average inferences about sentence identity and structure involve a tradeoff between (i) the prior probability of a grammati-cal derivation given a speaker X  X  linguistic knowl-edge and (ii) the fidelity of the derivation X  X  yield to the true sentence, as measured by a combination of true noise processes and the comprehender X  X  beliefs about those processes. 3.1 Inducing hallucinated garden paths Returning to our discussion of the NP/Z ambigu-ity, the relative ease of comprehending (3) entails an interpretation in the uncertain-input model that the cost of infidelity to surface input is sufficient to prevent comprehenders from deriving strong belief in a hallucinated garden-path analysis of (3) pre-disambiguation in which the comma is ignored. At the same time, the uncertain-input theory predicts that if we manipulate the balance of prior grammat-ical probabilities P (i) in Equation (II)), it may shift the comprehender X  X  beliefs toward a garden-path interpretation. This ob-servation sets the stage for our experimental manip-ulation, illustrated below: Example (4) is qualitatively similar to (3), but with two crucial differences. First, there has been LOCA -TIVE INVERSION (Bolinger, 1971; Bresnan, 1994) in the main clause: a locative PP has been fronted before the verb, and the subject NP is realized postverbally. Locative inversion is a low-frequency construction, hence it is crucially disfavored by the comprehender X  X  prior over possible grammatical structures. Second, the subordinate-clause verb is no longer transitive, as in (3); instead it is intran-sitive but could itself take the main-clause fronted PP as a dependent. Taken together, these prop-erties should shift comprehenders X  posterior infer-ences given prior grammatical knowledge and pre-disambiguation input more sharply than in (3) to-ward the input-unfaithful interpretation in which the immediately preverbal main-clause constituent ( to-ward the tank in (4)) is interpreted as a dependent of the subordinate-clause verb, as if the comma were absent.

If comprehenders do indeed seriously entertain such interpretations, then we should be able to find the empirical hallmarks (e.g., elevated reading times) of garden-path disambiguation at the main-clause verb lurched , which is incompatible with the  X  X allucinated X  garden-path interpretation. Empiri-cally, however, it is important to disentangle these empirical hallmarks of garden-path disambiguation from more general disruption that may be induced by encountering locative inversion itself. We ad-dress this issue by introducing a control condition in which a postverbal PP is placed within the subor-dinate clause: Crucially, this PP fills a similar thematic role for the subordinate-clause verb marched as the main-clause fronted PP would, reducing the ex-tent to which the comprehender X  X  prior favors the input-unfaithful interpretation (that is, the prior ra-much lower than the corresponding prior ratio locative inversion present. Finally, to ensure that sentence length itself does not create a confound driving any observed processing-time difference, we cross presence/absence of the subordinate-clause PP with inversion in the main clause: To determine the predictions of our uncertain-input/surprisal model for the above sentence types, we extracted a small grammar from the parsed Table 1: A small PCFG (lexical rewrite rules omit-ted) covering the constructions used in (4) X (6), with probabilities estimated from the parsed Brown cor-pus.
 Brown corpus (Ku  X  cera and Francis, 1967; Marcus et al., 1994), covering sentence-initial subordinate non-terminal rewrite rules are shown in Table 1, along with their probabilities; of terminal rewrite rules for all words which either appear in the sen-tences to be parsed or appeared at least five times in the corpus, with probabilities estimated by relative frequency.

As we describe in the following two sections, un-certain input is represented as a weighted finite-state automaton (WFSA), allowing us to represent the in-cremental inferences of the comprehender through intersection of the input WFSA with the PCFG above (Bar-Hillel et al., 1964; Nederhof and Satta, 2003, 2008). 4.1 Uncertain-input representations Levy (2008a) introduced the L EVENSHTEIN -DISTANCE KERNEL as a model of the average effect of noise in uncertain-input probabilistic sentence comprehension; this corresponds to term (ii) in our Equation (II). This kernel had a single noise parameter governing scaling of the cost of consid-ering word substitutions , insertions , and deletions are considered, with the cost of a word substitution falling off exponentially with Levenshtein distance between the true word and the substituted word, and the cost of word insertion or deletion falling off exponentially with word length. The distribution over the infinite set of strings in a weighted finite-state automaton, facilitating efficient inference.

We use the Levenshtein-distance kernel here to capture the effects of perceptual noise, but make two modifications necessary for incremental inference and for the correct computation of surprisal values for new input: the distribution over already-seen in-put must be proper , and possible future inputs must be costless . The resulting weighted finite-state rep-resentation of noisy input for a true sentence prefix w  X  = w 1 ...j is a j + 1 -state automaton with arcs as follows:  X  For each i  X  1 , . . . , j :  X  A loop arc from j to j for each word w  X  in Figure 2: Noisy WFSA for partial input it hit. . . with lexicon { it , hit , him } , noise parameter  X  =1  X  State j is a zero-cost final state; no other states
The addition of loop arcs at state n allows mod-eling of incremental comprehension through the au-tomaton/grammar intersection (see also Hale, 2006); and the fact that these arcs are costless ensures that the partition function of the intersection reflects only the grammatical prior plus the costs of input already seen. In order to ensure that the distribution over already-seen input is proper, we normalize the costs on outgoing arcs from all states but j . 6 Figure 2 gives an example of a simple WFSA representation for a short partial input with a small lexicon. 4.2 Inference Computing the surprisal incurred by the disam-biguating element given an uncertain-input repre-sentation of the sentence involves a standard appli-cation of the definition of conditional probability (Hale, 2001): Since our uncertain inputs I WFSA, the probability P ( I tition function of the intersection of this WFSA with class of weighted context-free grammars (WCFGs), which are closed under intersection with WFSAs; a constructive procedure exists for finding the inter-section (Bar-Hillel et al., 1964; Nederhof and Satta, 2003). Hence we are left with finding the partition function of a WCFG, which cannot be computed ex-actly, but a number of approximation methods are known (Stolcke, 1995; Smith and Johnson, 2007; Nederhof and Satta, 2008). In practice, the com-putation required to compute the partition function under any of these methods increases with the size of the WCFG resulting from the intersection, which for a binarized PCFG with R rules and an n -state mented what is to our knowledge a novel method for finding the minimal grammar including all rules that will have non-zero probability in the intersec-tion. We first parse the WFSA bottom-up with the item-based method of Goodman (1999) in the Boolean semiring, storing partial results in a chart. After completion of this bottom-up parse, every rule that will have non-zero probability in the intersec-tion PCFG will be identifiable with a set of entries in the chart, but not all entries in this chart will have non-zero probability, since some are not con-nected to the root. Hence we perform a second, top-down Boolean-semiring parsing pass on the bottom-up chart, throwing out entries that cannot be derived from the root. We can then include in the intersec-tion grammar only those rules from the classic con-struction that can be identified with a set of surviv-functions for each category in this intersection gram-mar can then be computed; we used a fixed-point method preceded by a topological sort on the gram-mar X  X  ruleset, as described by Nederhof and Satta (2008). To obtain the surprisal of the input deriv-ing from a word w pute the partition functions for noisy inputs I and I w in Equation (III). 4.3 Predictions The noise level  X  is a free parameter in this model, so we plot model predictions X  X he expected surprisal of input from the main-clause verb for each vari-ant of the target sentence in (4) X (6) X  X ver a wide range of its possible values (Figure 3). The far left of the graph asymptotes toward the predictions of clean surprisal , or noise-free input. With little to no input uncertainty, the presence of the comma rules out the garden-path analysis of the fronted PP toward the tank , and the surprisal at the main-clause verb is the same across condition (here reflecting only the un-certainty of verb identity for this small grammar). As input uncertainty increases, however, surprisal in the [Inverted,  X  PP] condition increases, reflect-ing the stronger belief given preceding context in an input-unfaithful interpretation. To test these predictions we conducted a word-by-word self-paced reading study, in which partici-pants read by pressing a button to reveal each suc-cessive word in a sentence; times between but-ton presses are recorded and analyzed as an in-dex of incremental processing difficulty (Mitchell, 1984). Forty monolingual native-English speaker participants read twenty-four sentence quadruplets ( X  X tems X ) on the pattern of (4) X (6), with a Latin-square design so that each participant saw an equal number of sentences in each condition and saw each item only once. Experimental items were pseudo-randomly interspersed with 62 filler sentences; no two experimental items were ever adjacent. Punctu-ation was presented with the word to its left, so that for (4) the four and fifth button presses would yield and respectively (right-truncated here for reasons of space). Every sentence was followed by a yes/no comprehension question (e.g., Did the tank lurch to-ward an injured enemy combatant? ); participants re-ceived feedback whenever they answered a question incorrectly.

Reading-time results are shown in Figure 4. As can be seen, the model X  X  predictions are matched at the main-clause verb: reading times are highest in the [Inverted,  X  PP] condition, and there is an interaction between main-clause inversion and pres-ence of a subordinate-clause PP such that presence of the latter reduces reading times more for inverted than for uninverted main clauses. This interaction is significant in both by-participants and by-items ANOVAs (both p &lt; 0 . 05 ) and in a linear mixed-effects analysis with participants-and item-specific random interactions ( t &gt; 2 ; see Baayen et al., 2008). The same pattern persists and remains significant through to the end of the sentence, indicating con-siderable processing disruption, and is also observed in question-answering accuracies for experimental sentences, which are superadditively lowest in the [Inverted,  X  PP] condition (Table 2).

The inflated reading times for the [Inverted,  X 
PP] condition beginning at the main-clause verb confirm the predictions of the uncertain-input/surprisal theory. Crucially, the input that would on our theory induce the comprehender to question the comma (the fronted main-clause PP) Figure 4: Average reading times for each part of the sentence, broken down by experimental condition is not seen until after the comma is no longer visi-ble (and presumably has been integrated into beliefs about syntactic analysis on veridical-input theories). This empirical result is hence difficult to accommo-date in accounts which do not share our theory X  X  cru-cial property that comprehenders can revise their be-lief in previous input on the basis of current input. Language is redundant: the content of one part of a sentence carries predictive value both for what will precede and what will follow it. For this reason, and because the path from a speaker X  X  intended utterance to a comprehender X  X  perceived input is noisy and error-prone, a comprehension system making opti-mal use of available information would use current input not only for forward prediction but also to as-sess the veracity of previously encountered input. Here we have developed a theory of how such an adaptive error-correcting capacity is a consequence of noisy-channel inference, with a comprehender X  X  beliefs regarding sentence form and structure at any moment in incremental comprehension reflecting a balance between fidelity to perceptual input and a preference for structures with higher prior proba-bility. As a consequence of this theory, certain types of sentence contexts will cause the drive to-ward higher prior-probability analyses to overcome the drive to maintain fidelity to input, undermin-ing the comprehender X  X  belief in an earlier part of the input actually perceived in favor of an analy-sis unfaithful to part of the true input. If subse-quent input strongly disconfirms this incorrect in-terpretation, we should see behavioral signatures of classic garden-path disambiguation. Within the the-ory, the size of this  X  X allucinated X  garden-path ef-fect is indexed by the surprisal value under uncer-tain input, marginalizing over the actual sentence observed. Based on a model implementing the-ory we designed a controlled psycholinguistic ex-periment making specific predictions regarding the role of fine-grained grammatical context in modu-lating comprehenders X  strength of belief in a highly specific bit of linguistic input X  X  comma marking the end of a sentence-initial subordinate clause X  and tested those predictions in a self-paced read-ing experiment. As predicted by the theory, read-ing times at the word disambiguating the  X  X alluci-nated X  garden-path were inflated relative to control conditions. These results contribute to the theory of uncertain-input effects in online sentence process-ing by suggesting that comprehenders may be in-duced not only to entertain but to adopt relatively strong beliefs in grammatical analyses that require modification of the surface input itself. Our results also bring a new degree of nuance to surprisal the-ory, demonstrating that perceptual neighbors of true preceding input may need to be taken into account in order to estimate how surprising a comprehender will find subsequent input to be.

Beyond the domain of psycholinguistics, the methods employed here might also be usefully ap-plied to practical problems such as parsing of de-graded or fragmentary sentence input, allowing joint constraint derived from grammar and available input to fill in gaps (Lang, 1988). Of course, practical ap-plications of this sort would raise challenges of their own, such as extending the grammar to broader cov-erage, which is delicate here since the surface in-put places a weaker check on overgeneration from the grammar than in traditional probabilistic pars-ing. Larger grammars also impose a technical bur-den since parsing uncertain input is in practice more computationally intensive than parsing clean input, raising the question of what approximate-inference algorithms might be well-suited to processing un-certain input with grammatical knowledge. Answers to this question might in turn be of interest for sen-tence processing, since the exhaustive-parsing ideal-ization employed here is not psychologically plausi-ble. It seems likely that human comprehension in-volves approximate inference with severely limited memory that is nonetheless highly optimized to re-cover something close to the intended meaning of an utterance, even when the recovered meaning is not completely faithful to the input itself. Arriving at models that closely approximate this capacity would be of both theoretical and practical value.
