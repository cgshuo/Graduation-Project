 1. Introduction
The primary motive for telecommunications service provision nications business. However the aim of the telecommunications managers is not only the maximization of profit but also the reduction of unnecessary cost.

Making use of the historical data, telecommunications man-agers may predict the future demand by creating a reasonably infrastructure investment and the call volume strategy are the topics for which managerial decisions depend on the forecast. order to map future trends and usage patterns.

In the case of large organizations, who are actually the customers of the telecommunications carriers, the managerial employees, primarily for use in normal business activities and managers must find and capitalize on opportunities for control-ling telecommunications costs.

A case of such an organization is a University Campus with more than 6000 employees and 70,000 students, and an extended tele-communications infrastructur e with more than 5500 telephone call volume are vital to the planning of future installations. The University holds an extended database, made by the Call includes information such as the call origin, the area code and of the national, the international and the mobile calls per employee per month. A forecast of future call volume will help the campus. On the other hand, calls to mobile destinations are penetration rate of mobile services. In fact, the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) reports a penetration rate of 119.12% for Greece in 2009 (ITU-TICTeye, 2010 ).

The weights for the previous data values are terms of a geometric series and get smaller as the observations move further into the past.

Another familiar method to analyze stationary univariate time series data was developed by Box and Jenkins (1976 ). The method, which is called Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average method (ARIMA), presumes a weak stationarity, equally The seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) also exists.

After fitting a time series model, one can evaluate it with forecast fit measures. The data set is usually divided into a set is used to estimate any parameters and to initialize the method. Forecasts are made for the validation set which was not used in the model fitting. The observer may subtract the forecast value from the corresponding measured value of the genuine measure of the forecasting ability of the model.
To evaluate the amount of forecast error, one may employ the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean squared error (MSE), the mean squared error (RMSE). The aforementioned statistics mea-percentage error (MAPE) ( Makridakis et al., 1998 ).

Locally Recurrent Neurofuzzy Forecasting System (LR-NFFS)
The suggested Locally Recurrent Neurofuzzy Forecasting Sys-comprises generalized Takagi X  X ugeno X  X ang ( Takagi and Sugeno, 1986 ) rules in the form LR-NFFS has the following structural characteristics:
The premise and defuzzification parts are static, described by m j  X  k  X  X  f m  X  u  X  k  X  ; m j  X  k  X  , r j  X  k  X  X  X  3  X  of the j -th rule and m j  X  k  X  X  X  m j 1  X  k  X  , ... , m jm membership functions. The degree of fulfillment is the alge-braic product of the corresponding membership functions: m j  X  k  X  X 
The system X  X  overall output is derived via the weighted average defuzzification method, as given below: y  X  k  X  X 
The consequent parts of the fuzzy rules are dynamic. Their structural elements are neurons with local output feedback at the hidden and output layers. Thus, dynamics is introduced to the overall system through these feedback connections. No feedback connections of the rule X  X  total output or connections among neurons of the same layer exist.

The operation of the consequent part of the l -th fuzzy rule is described by the following set of equations:
O  X  k  X  X  f 1 i  X  1 , ... , H , j  X  1 , ... , r  X  7a  X  g  X  k  X  X  f 2 where the following notations are used: f , f 2 are the neuron activation functions of the hidden and the output layers, respectively. In the following, the activation

Extraction of the error gradients
Since the premise and defuzzification parts are static, the gradients of the error function with respect to the weights of the premise part are derived using the standard partial deriva-tives.

Simulation results The data in hand cover a period of 10 years, January 1998 X  December 2007, and are the monthly outgoing calls to national and mobile destinations originating from the PBX of a large organization.

Apart from that, the number of calls to mobile destinations ( Fig. 3 b) shows an increasing trend which comports with reports on mobile services penetration (ITU-TICTeye, 2010 ).

One may observe how the LR-NFFS forecast follows the actual data pattern against the second best model, which misses the behavior of the first two months (January and February, 2007). Moreover, the actual data are not even within the 95% prediction interval of the Damped MS forecast.

Interestingly, the second best-fit model (Damped MS) was the best fit model indicated for the same type of calls in a past mobile calls, which refrains users from making many calls to mobile destinations and retards the upward tendency X  X . With our current point of view an alternative reasoning for this damped trend may be the approach to a saturation point in mobile penetration. 6. Conclusion
