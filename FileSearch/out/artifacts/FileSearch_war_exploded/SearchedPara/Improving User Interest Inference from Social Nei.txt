 Prior research has provided some evidence of social correla-tion ( i.e. ,  X  X ou are who you know X ), which makes it possible to infer one X  X  interests from his or her social neighbors. How-ever, it is also shown to be challenging to consistently obtain high quality inference. This challenge can be partially at-tributed to the fact that people usually maintain diverse social relationships, in order to tap into diverse information and knowledge. It is unlikely that a person would possess all interests of his/her social neighbors. Instead, s/he may selectively acquire just a subset of them. This paper in-tends to improve inferring interests from neighbors given this observation. We conduct this study by implementing a privacy-preserving large distributed social sensor system in a large global IT company to capture the multifaceted ac-tivities ( e.g. ,emails,instantmessaging,socialbookmarking, etc. ) of 25K+ people. These activities occupy the majority of employees X  time, and thus, provide a higher quality view of the diverse aspects of their professional interests com-pared to the friending activity on online social networking sites. In this paper, we propose a technique that exploits the correlation among the attributes that a person possesses to improve social-correlation-based inference quality. Our tech-nique offers two unique contributions. First, we demonstrate that the proposed technique can significantly improve infer-ence quality by as much as 76.1%. Second, we study the interaction between the two factors: social correlation and attribute correlation under different situations. The results can inform practical applications how the inference quality would change in various scenarios.

Research has shown that a user X  X  interests and attributes may be inferred from his or her social neighbors [14, 15]. Such inferred interests can enable applications to provide personalized results to meet an individual user X  X  needs, even when the user is new to the applications. In addition, such inference may reveal attributes that a user intends to keep private. We can keep the user aware of the attributes that may be accurately inferred from his/her social neighbors, such that the user can mark related social relationships as private to improve privacy control.

It is, however, challenging to obtain consistently high qual-ity results in inferring user interests from social neighbors [15]. The quality can vary significantly due to several fac-tors. First, users may not use social applications intensively to leave enough traces to reveal about their social interac-tions. Second, certain user attributes can be difficult to infer from social neighbors. For example, the social correlation of a group of college students X  hometowns can be much lower than the correlation of their ages [14]. As a result, high quality inference results may be only achieved for a small subset of users.

One particular challenge is that a user usually maintains many different types of diverse social relationships. For ex-ample, a social software researcher, whom we call Alice, in-teracts with different social neighbors for different purposes. Alice may share a few interests with many of her social neighbors, such as  X  X ocial network X  and  X  X eb technologies X . However, Alice is not likely to be interested in everything her neighbors are interested, such as her personal friends X   X  X LSI X  job. Even in one type of social relationships such as  X  X ersonal friends X , Alice X  X  interests may still significantly vary from her friends, except for a few common hobbies.
To address the challenge, this paper focuses on improving the quality of inferring user inte rests from social neighbors. Specifically, we propose a novel method that exploits the correlation among multiple attributes of a user, in addition to the social correlation of an attribute among a group of users. It first uses social correlation to obtain initial infer-ence from neighbors. Then, it refines the inference using attribute correlation to remove less likely attribute combi-nations ( e.g.  X  X ocial software X  and  X  X LSI X ). In this study, we do not consider the friending activity on online social net-working sites. Instead, we imple mented a privacy-preserving large distributed social sensor system [12] in a large global IT company to capture the multifaceted information of 25K+ people, including profiles with 1000+ attributes, 20+ million records of communications ( e.g. , emails, instant messaging, etc .) and Web 2.0 activities ( e.g. , social bookmarking, blog-ging, etc .). Such data enable us to examine attribute corre-lation in large attribute sets. With attribute sets of different sizes, we may understand thoroughly how attribute correla-tion would be complementary to social correlation for infer-ring user interests. To the best of our knowledge, we pro-pose the first optimization-based method combining social correlation and attributes correlation to improve user inter-est inference from social neighbors. We demonstrate that it can improve inference quality significantly. For instance, for the two datasets tested, the average inference quality is improved from 45.1% to 60.3%, and from 30.1% to 53%, re-spectively. We also show how the correlation among a set of attributes would impact inference quality in different situ-ations. For example, the usefulness of attribute correlation depends on its value distribution in different datasets.
Social influence and correlation among people X  X  behavior have been extensively studied by social network researchers [11]. Lately, researchers have explored data mining tech-niques to model various aspects of social influence in online social networks [3, 7]. Based on social correlation, various approaches have been developed for inferring patterns and making prediction. Jensen et al. [10], among others, pro-pose a relational knowledge discovery scheme called collec-tive classification ( a.k.a. , collective intelligence) that utilizes the relationship between individual entities. Getoor and Diehl present a survey of collective classification research in [9]. In contrast to previous work, we exploit the correla-tion of attributes possessed by an individual to improve the inference quality.

In addition, a large number of researches have been done to discover patterns from the correlation of attributes in large datasets. Association rule mining [1] is one of the most popular approaches. A few researches on social net-work analysis have recognized the benefits of combining so-cial and attribute correlation. Lindamood et al. [13] obtain 1% improvement in attribute predictions by averaging re-sults based on links and content. To achieve more signifi-cant improvement, our work further explores optimization-based approaches to combine social and attribute correla-tion. Other researches [2, 5, 6] have also jointly modeled social links and topic information to better identify commu-nities. While they are good at providing holistic views of overall social-topic distributions, our work focuses on utiliz-ing the distributions to optimize predicting individual peo-ple X  X  attributes.
Users usually maintain social relationship with a diverse set of social neighbors. Different aspects of their behavior and interests may be influenced by different social neighbors. Therefore, a user may not have all of his or her neighbors X  interests. In this section, we present an approach to improv-ing user interest inference by exploiting attribute correlation to remove less likely combinations of interests/attributes. First, we briefly overview social-correlation-based user in-terest inference, proposed in [15]. Then, we describe how to improve it by incorporating attribute correlation.
In this study, we adopt user interest models in [15], and communication data collected by a privacy-preserving large distributed social sensor system [12]. In particular, we focus on improving the precision, because inference based on social correlation tends to achieve high recall and low precision [15]. Nevertheless, the precision is usually more important for practical applications to provide personalized services.
To infer users X  interests, we let variable Z denote the de-gree users are interested in a set of attributes, where z the i -th user X  X  interest in the j -th attribute. The attribute can be a topic in the implicit user interests expressed in their conversations, or a term in the explicit user interests spec-ified in their profiles. Our baseline approach in [15] utilize a network autocorrelation mode l to infer user interests from social neighbors.

The quality of inference is not reliable using only the so-cial correlation model. For example, the mean quality of the inferred implicit interests is 45.1%, and the variance is as large as 21.7% [15]. One solution that has been proposed in [15] is to use a inference quality predictor, which predicts how good the inference will be based on social network fea-tures. Then, the interests of a user is inferred only when the predictor gives good estimates. The results showed that this technique improves the mean quality of inferred implicit interests to 64.4%, but only for about 5% of the users (see Figure 5(b)). Therefore, further improvement is needed.
Users typically interact with different sets of people for different purposes. In other words, they can participate in a diverse set of communities where interests/attributes in each community may be quite different. In this situation, the interests of a particular user may not be the union of the interests from all his or her communities. Instead, his or her interests are likely to be a subset of the union. Previous data mining researches on association rules have shown that interesting correlation can be discovered among attributes in large datasets. We therefore exploit such attribute corre-lation to refine inferred attributes obtained by social corre-lation.

We compute the correlation between the j -th attribute and the k -th attribute as the Pearson correlation coefficient: where z ij is the j -th attribute of user i .

Then, given an initial set of attributes A 0 inferred based on social correlation for user i , we try to find the optimal subset A = &lt;a 1 , .., a n &gt; by balancing three constraints. First, the total degree of interests on attributes in A ( i.e. , k =1 z i,a k ) should be maximized. Next, the overall pairwise attribute correlation in A ( i.e. , k = j n j =1 r jk ) should be maximized. Finally, smaller size of A ( i.e. , len ( A )) should be favored, if everything else equals ( i.e. , Occam X  X  razor principle). This optimization can be formulated as a gener-alized assignment problem, which is NP-hard [8]. Thus, we use a greedy approach to approximating the optimization. Figure 1: A greedy algorithm for improving inferred interests based on attribute correlation.
Figure 1 gives an outline of the algorithm. We define a reward function to measure the desirability of keeping an attribute in the target optimal attribute set A .Forthe i -th user X  X  attribute j in A , the reward function is: reward ( j, A )= o 1  X  z ij + o 2  X  AttrCorr ( j, A )  X  o where AttrCorr ( j, A ) measures the attribute-correlation-based desirability of attribute j given A ,and o 1 , o 2 and o are weights controlling the relative importance of the three factors. AttrCorr ( j, A ) is defined as: The intuition of AttrCorr ( j, A ) is that a good candidate for the optimal attribute set is an attribute with the high correlation with all the other attributes.

For weights o 1 , o 2 and o 3 ,wehave o 1 + o 2 + o 3 =1. In our study, we set o 3 =0 . 05 to favor result sets with size less than 20, since many practical search and recommender applications focus on users X  top interests ( e.g. , top 20). Next, we experiment with two weighting strategies for o 1 ,which are described in details in Section 3.2.2. Finally, o 2 can be computed as 1  X  o 3  X  o 1 .
In our approach, we investigate two different weighting schemes to control the relative importance of the social and attribute correlation.
 A simple scheme is to use fixed values for o 1 and o 2 during the optimization process. In our experiment, we evaluate the quality of inference using different values of the weights. In Section 4, we show that even this simple scheme would yield good improvement over previous approaches.
 We hypothesize that social correlation is more important at the initial stage of the inference, since no attributes are known for a user. However, as more attributes are inferred for the user, attribute correlation may provide more cues than social correlation. Therefore, a dynamic weighting scheme for o 1 may work better than fixed weights. To this end, we propose o 1 as an exponential decay function of set A  X  X  size. Moreover, the decay needs to depend on the useful-ness of the attribute correlation to inference. A possible use-fulness indicator can be the distribution of attribute correla-tion values Pr . For example, a distribution with more non-zero values may provide more useful inputs to the attribute-correlation-based inference, and thus the weight of social correlation o 1 should be smaller. We define o 1 as where f ( Pr ) is a usefulness indicator computed from the attribute correlation distribution Pr .Inourwork,wefit Pr to an exponential distribution with exponent b ( b&lt; 0). A smaller | b | value means a heavier tail and thus more non-zero attribute correlation values can be used as cues for our inference algorithm. Therefore, we set f ( Pr )= c | b | ,where b is the exponential distribution exponent and c is a positive constant factor to be determined in experiments.

In addition, we hypothesize that the weights may be af-fected by the diversity of a person X  X  network. For example, if s/he has very diverse social neighbors, his/her attributes inferred based on social correlation can be very diverse too. For such users, the attribute correlation can be more im-portant in identifying likely combinations of attributes. We use a network diversity metric [15] to measure the degree to which nodes have diverse social neighbors in a network. For an individual i , the network diversity of i is defined proportion of node i  X  X  network efforts invested in communi-cating with node l . Small values of d ( i ) indicate that the neighbors of node i are considered concentrated instead of diverse. Then, Equation 2 can be augmented as:
The improved user interest inference algorithm can also be used together with a inference quality predictor such as the one proposed in [15]. Such predictor estimates infer-ence quality based on easily observed social network features ( e.g. , network in-degree, out-degree, betweenness centrality and etc .), in order to allow searc h and recommendation ap-plications make informed decisions on when to utilize in-ferred user interests. In [15], it is shown that significantly higher inference quality can be achieved for users identified by the predictor. It is natural to assume that using the infer-ence quality predictor will fu rther improve the performance of our approach, since the two are complementary: the qual-ity predictor leverages social network properties, and our approach exploits attribute correlation. However, the users identified by the predictor are the ones for whom we can ob-serve strong social correlation . Therefore, the contribution of attribution correlation may be relatively small, in terms of improving inferring user interests. In Section 4.4, we val-idate our hypothesis that this combination can yield further improvement in performance.
In our experiment, we evaluate the performance of our approach under various conditions.
First, we examine the inference quality of the proposed approach, when using fixed weights in the reward function (Equation 1). We compare it to a baseline approach using Figure 2: The performance improvement of mean inference quality in inferring user interests for dif-ferent fixed social correlation weight o 1 :(a)theim-plicit interests; (b) the explicit interests. only social correlation [15]. For inferring implicit interests on the same data sets, the baseline approach achieved a mean inference quality of 45.1%, with a standard deviation of 21.7%. We experiment with different values for o 1 .The improvement over the baseline approach is shown in Fig-ure 2(a). Our approach can achieve inference quality up to 60.3%, an improvement of 33.8%. Moreover, we observe that different weights yield significantly different improvements. The best improvement (33.8%) is achieved when o 1 =0 . 2, which means social correlation plays a less important role than the attribute correlation among the implicit interests.
We also investigate the performance improvement for in-ferring explicit user interests. The baseline method has a mean inference precision of 30.1% and a standard devia-tion of 26.9%. In Figure 2(b), we see that our method can achieve a mean inference precision of 53.0%, an improve-ment of 76.1% over the baseline method. In addition, the standard deviation is roughly at the same level. In contrast to the implicit interest inference (Figure 2(a)), the best im-provement for explicit interest inference (76.1%) is obtained at o 1 =0 . 7. This larger optimal o 1 value suggests that so-cial correlation is more important here. Since users X  social relationships are the same for both cases, we attribute the difference to the different correlation among different sets of attributes.
To address the deficiency of the fixed weight scheme, we design a dynamic weight scheme where the social correlation weight o 1 exponentially decays based on the properties of the attribute correlation distribution (Section 3.2.2).
We first examine the distribution of attribute correlation by fitting it to an exponential curve. For both types of in-terests, we obtain R-square statistics larger than 0 . 97 and p&lt; 0 . 01, suggesting good fits to the exponential distribu-tion. Specifically, the exponent b for the implicit interests is -1 . 39, and the exponent b for the explicit interests is -12 . 95. That means the attribute correlation values of the explicit interests decrease much faster than those of the implicit in-terests do. Therefore, there a re more non-zero correlation values for the implicit user interests. That is, the attribute correlation can be more important for the implicit inter-est inference than the explicit interest inference. It helps to explain why the optimal social correlation weight o 1 in the fixed weighting scheme (Section 4.1) is smaller for the implicit interests than the explicit interests. Figure 3: The performance of inferring user in-terests using dynamic social correlation weight o 1 : (a) the implicit interests; (b) the explicit interests. Best-Fixed and Worst-Fixed refer to the best and worst performance for various fixed o 1 values.
 We then evaluate how the dynamic weighting scheme in Equation 2 can improve the inference quality for both types of interests. For the usefulness indicator f ( Pr )inEquation 2, we also vary its constant c to examine its impact. In our experiment, we see that the dynamic weight scheme with c =0 . 1 can achieve performance very close to the optimal performance in the fixed weighting scheme (Section 4.1), for both types of interests (Figure 3). Hence, compared to the fixed weighting scheme, the dynamic weighting scheme can be more easily generalized to different datasets since it in-corporates the datasets X  attribute correlation properties.
Next, we examine the performance of the dynamic weight-ing scheme that incorporates net work diversity metric (Equa-tion 3). The improvements over the results in Figure 3 are less than 1% and statistically not significant. One possible explanation for this insignificant difference is that a person with diverse networks may also have higher capacities in processing information in social interactions, and thus can have more diverse interests.
In addition to the distribution of attribute correlation, we hypothesize that the number of attributes also influences our approach X  X  performance. Intuitively, the more attributes there are, the more likely an attribute is correlated with other attributes. Thus, our approach may better exploit attribute correlation to improve inference as the number of attributes increases. To validate this hypothesis, we perform random sampling to obtain data with attribute sets of differ-ent sizes, for both the implicit and the explicit interests. For each attribute set size, we obtain 20 datasets through sam-pling to ensure statistical significance. Figure 4 shows how the improvements vary as the number of attributes changes. The dashed lines show the 25% and 75% quantiles. For both of the implicit and the explicit interests, we can observe a trend matching our hypothesis: the more attributes we have, the more we can improve inferring interests. Specifically, if there are just a small number of attributes ( e.g. , &lt; 100), we may not get a significant improvement by exploiting at-tribute correlation.
To make inferred user interests useful for applications, a previous approach [15] proposed a technique to predict in-ference quality based on network characteristics. The tech-nique then only infers interests for users with predicted qual-Figure 4: The quality improvements of user interest inference for different number of attributes: (a) the implicit user interest; (b) the explicit user interest. ity higher than a predefined criterion. For example, a predic-tor with the criterion c 50, or quality &gt; 50%, means that the predictor only outputs users for whom the predicted qual-ity is larger than 50%. On the same dataset, it achieved a quality up to 64.4% for the implicit interests, and a preci-sion up to 60.5% for the explicit interests. However, such performance is only for a small subset of the users, i.e. ,less than 5%. In our experiment, we compare the performance of our approach and the baseline approach in [15], when using the inference quality predictor. Let S-P denote the baseline approach that uses only S ocial correlation with the P redictor, and SA-P denote our approach that uses S ocial and A ttribute correlation with the P redictor. The compar-isons are shown in Figure 5.

In Figure 5(a) and 5(c), we can see that exploiting at-tribute correlation gives significant improvement for the qual-ity predictors with different criteria, for both the implicit and the explicit interests. Specifically, such improvement is the largest for predictors with the lowest criterion ( e.g. , c 10), and then gradually decreases as higher criteria are used ( e.g. , c 50). The trend can be attributed to the fact that a predictor with higher criteria ( e.g. , c 50) is likely to identify users with stronger social correlation. Therefore, the benefit of exploiting attribute correlation can be reduced for this set of users. Then, we examine the relationship between infer-ence quality and the percentage of users that are identified by the predictor. We vary the criteria of the predictor, and obtain the corresponding inference quality and the percent-age of users identified. The results are illustrated in Figure 5(b) and 5(d). In both types of interests, our approach of-fers consistent improvements. Overall, for the majority of the users, our approach improves inference quality in a range of 10% to 15% for the implicit interests (Figure 5(b)), and 18% to 25% for the explicit interests (Figure 5(d)). When the predictor uses higher criteria to select a small percentage of users ( e.g. , &lt; 20%), the inference quality of the baseline method quickly improves for identified users. Yet our ap-proach still significantly outperforms by 5% to 15%.
In this section, we compare the performance of our ap-proach with clustering techniques that jointly model social-attribute correlation. In particular, we compare with an im-plementation [4] of mixed membership stochastic blockmod-els (MMSB) [2]. MMSB can associate a node in a network with multiple clusters, based on network connections as well as the node attributes. For our dataset, this method can find the probabilities the i -th person belongs to M latent  X  X om-in the j -th attribute can be inferred as z ij = M k =1 p where A kj is the strength of the j -th attributes in the k -th community. It is computed by averaging people X  X  interests in attribute j within the community.

We can use a threshold to filter the inferred set of at-tributes, and then measure the corresponding precision and recall defined in [15]. By varying the threshold, we obtain a precision-recall curve for MMSB. Figure 6 shows such a curve derived for explicit user interests and M = 50. In our experiment, we tested M values ranging from 20 to 100, and the curves are similar. For our proposed approach, we use the dynamic weighting scheme in Section 4.2 and vary the scaling factor c of f ( Pr )togetaprecision-recallcurve. The figure shows that both approaches perform better than the baseline method [15] that only utilizes social correlation. In addition, we can see that our approach provides significant advantage over MMSB. The advantage may be explained by that people can still have quite diverse attributes even in the same community identified by MMSB. This has been ob-served in other community-based approaches ( e.g. , [14]) as well, especially in weak communities. Therefore, optimizing inference for each individual may still improve performance. We also experimented with inferring implicit user interests, as well as incorporating inference quality predictor as in Sec-tion 4.4. Similar trends of improvement can be observed so that they are omitted here due to space limit. Figure 6: The performance comparison of our ap-proach with MMSB [2] and the baseline method [15] in inferring explicit user interests.
Our results can help to improve personalized services. In addition, they may help to improve privacy control in social networks. Users usually want to control what information to share about themselves. However, it becomes challenging as our and other researches have shown that such information may be inferred from their social neighbors. Figure 7: The inference quality change over a 24-month period for two attributes of a user: (a) at-tribute j 1 ; (b) attribute j 2 .

To assist users to achieve better privacy control in such complex situations, our technique can be used to show users how well their attributes can be inferred. For example, Fig-ure 7 illustrates that a user in our system can keep track of how likely two of his/her attributes will  X  X eak X  out via the social neighbors. Comparing the two attributes, attribute j (in Figure 7(a)) is an attribute shared by relatively more people ( e.g. , being interested in knowledge management). Thus, a growing network will mostly make it easier to infer it. In contrast, attribute j 2 in Figure 7(b) is shared by less people ( e.g. , being interested in a small company). There-fore, the ability of inferring this attribute from social neigh-bors is more sensitive to changes in networks. If the user wants to prevent others to infer an attribute ( e.g. , j 1 technique can recommend him/her to mark private the so-cial relationships where the neighbors have attributes highly correlated with j 1 . During this process, our technique keeps updating the display of the inference quality to help the user make sure that his/her goals are achieved. For example, to make attribute j 1 private ( e.g. , inference precision &lt; 3%), the user needs to hide 13% of his/her social neighbors. In contrast, only 4% of relationship needs to be hidden to pro-tect attribute j 2 .
We propose a technique combining social and attribute correlation to improve inferri ng user interests from social neighbors. Using data in one of the largest global orga-nizations, we demonstrate that our technique significantly improve inference quality by as much as 76.1% over existing approaches. To help practical applications better utilize this technique in different situations, we further investigate the interaction between the two factors in our technique: social and attribute correlation. Specifically, we show how they would impact the inference quality under different condi-tions. For example, as the number of observable attributes grows, the inference quality can be significantly improved, even for users with weak observed social correlation. Our findings can be useful for social applications that aim to provide personalized services but have to infer many new users X  interests from friends because of widely varied par-ticipation rate. In addition, our results can be exploited to design better privacy control tools in social applications.
