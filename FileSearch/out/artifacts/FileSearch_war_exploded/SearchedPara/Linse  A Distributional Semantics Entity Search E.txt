 Entering Football Players from United States when search-ing for American Footballers is an example of vocabulary mismatch , which occurs when different words are used to express the same concepts. In order to address this phe-nomenon for entity search targeting descriptors for complex categories , we propose a compositional-distributional seman-tics entity search engine, which extracts semantic and com-monsense knowledge from large-scale corpora to address the vocabulary gap between query and data.

Entities naming sets and categories are fundamental for describing structured, semi-structured and unstructured data and are present from Wikis to databases. The natural lan-guage descriptors associated with these entities are funda-mental to support users searching, querying or browsing structured or semi-structured data, which heavily depend on them to find the desired piece of information.
Users searching over a set of natural language category de-scriptors (NLCDs) demand principled mechanisms to sup-port crossing the semantic gap between the user queries and the target NLCDs. The vocabulary problem occurs when dif-ferent terms are used to express the same concepts. One of the first studies in this direction shows that 80% of people familiar with the same domain use different terms to name the same concept[4]. Search over collections which do not have high vocabulary redundancy is highly affected by the vocabulary problem, since users do not know which words l atedness between the query term and the indexed semantic cores, returning a set of most related semantic cores. For the example query, the corresponding  X  X anine X  semantic core is returned.

The next step consists in selecting the next core modifier, the adjective  X  X ncestral X , sending it as a query to the sub-space of specializations of  X  X anine X . The use of  X  X anine X  as a semantic pivot supports the reduction of the dimensional-ity of the distributional space, by only looking into special-izations which are applied to  X  X anine X . Using the distribu-tional semantic relatedness measure over the specializations subspace, it returns  X  X rehistoric canine X  as an output. The ranking approach uses as a ranking score a weighted com-position of the distributional relatedness measure between each query term and the matching NLCD terms. In the context of this work, Explicit Semantic Analysis [6] is used as a semantic relatedness measure.

Figure 1 shows an screenshot of the result set for the ex-ample query, which displays the search box, the ranked list of returned categories and their associated ranking scores. The use of the distributional semantic relatedness as a rank-ing function provides a comprehensive semantic matching mechanism [5] which is suitable for exploratory entity search scenarios.

For the demonstration, a knowledge base of more than 300,000 category descriptors corresponding to the Wikipedia category links were indexed. A set of natural language queries over the knowledge base are demonstrated in an on-NLCD mappings are listed on Table 1.

Linse was implemented using Java over Lucene and used the EasyESA framework [2] over the Wikipedia 2013 corpus. This paper demonstrated the Linse entity search engine. Linse uses a compositional-distributional model to provide a mechanism to search for complex category descriptors. The use of distributional semantic models provides a low-effort
