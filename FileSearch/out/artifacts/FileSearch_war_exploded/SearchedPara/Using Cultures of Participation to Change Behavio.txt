 My doctoral research addresses two major systemic problems: energy sustainability and educati on, specifically how to engage learners as active contributors and decision makers rather than passive consumers. I design, develop, and evaluate socio-technical environments that facilitate cultures of participation in order to change human behavior towards energy sustainability. I analyze group interactions that influence and determine cultures of participation and I am conducting crowd-sourced user studies with the goal of creating theoretically -based and empirically-supported frameworks for the creation of socio-technical environments.

Two of the most important and challenging problems pursued by the current US administration are energy sustainability and education, for the 21 st century. These are systemic problems that require fundamental changes in human behavior, technological environments, and mindsets. In my PhD research, I am addressing these two topics with an approach that facilitates cultures of participation to cause changes in society. Cultures of participation, building upon Web 2.0 software environments, are highly relevant to GROUP and at the same time insufficiently understood and supported. Building upon my own research on collaborative environments to support research communities and classroom activities [1], I am working to create a meta-design e nvironment [2], called eViz, in which participants learn and teach about the effects of their consumption behaviors. My major obj ective with eViz is to gain a better understanding of interactions within cultures of participation and groups of users [3]. Boundary objects are generally accepte d to play an important role in group interactions [4]. In my PhD research, I am combining the concept of boundary objects with in sights into the effects cultures have on cognition, perception, and decision making. I am analyzing how the knowledge of individuals interacts with their immediate environment and with their cultural background, influencing their actions and perceptions. An individual X  X  cultural background and beliefs also have an impact on their perception and cognition [5], and thus the boundary objects that work for them. People mi ght understand, agree with, or perceive things differently based on their existing values and world-views. For example, as easterner tend to have a more holistic and social perception than westerners [6], a system that focus on the money-savings and individual can achieve might be effective for Americans, but not for Chinese. And a system that tells users how to reduce CO2 emissions might not work for those who deny global warming, while the same people mi ght be motivated by a system showing how to reduce energy costs. To support more innovations and productive collaborations, I am extending the design methodology of meta-design that is focused on  X  X esign for designers X . It enables end-users and domain users to adapt, extend, and modify a system to their unique and specific needs and preferences. Meta-design is a framework that is well suited for cultures of participa tion because it is built around the notion that every user can become an active contributor rather than remain a passive consumer. My focus on energy education allows me to pursue a topic that is inherently social. Not only does the social environment influence energy consumption behaviors [7, 8]: everyone, the  X  X roup of all X , is impacted by the choices and actions individuals take. As such, the energy domain is meaningful to everyone but often neglected by people  X  something that could be changed if decision makers as well as designers understand better questions of group interactions and common boundary objects. As a first step, I analyzed group in teractions in studies run through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). AMT allows registered internet users  X  so-called turkers  X  to ta ke on small, paid tasks. AMT has been shown to produce reliable results for user studies [9]. By default, AMT tasks are open to all turkers. This might lead to noisy results for questions of group cognition if researchers don X  X  control for cultural backgrounds. To test my hypothesis that turkers with different cultural backgrounds produce significantly different results for cognitive studies, I ran a study based on earlier work by Nisbett. Two hundred turkers, half from the US, half from India, were asked to choose the  X  X ubjectiv ely best-fitting X  word-pair out of word-triplets (e.g. train, track, bus) . The results showed that Indian turkers were significantly more likely to choose functional relationship (e.g. train and track  X  the train runs on tracks) than US turkers, who were more likely to choose categorical pairs (e.g. train and bus  X  both are means of mass transportation). This confirms their cultural background inherently determines an individual X  X  cognition. Building upon those results, I ran tw o studies in which I controlled for cultural background and that were especially relevant to GROUP: I analyzed how online communities influence individual participants in terms of involvem ent and expressed perceptions of written text. These studies tested whether peer pressure [10, 11] would lead people to express different opinions on a text about energy waste and ways to save energy. The studies showed that while the group X  X  activity-level influences participants in their involvement, the group did not have a significant effect on how they perceived a given text about everyday energy waste. Previously, I only looked at immediate effects of a community on its members and did not analyze how cultural backgrounds and community activities interact. I could not clearly answer how designers can react to the findings and facilitate knowledge about group and cultural cognition to make systems more useful and interesting to a more di verse spectrum of people. I am currently developing eViz, a software system and research framework that addresses these issues. The system will be used for after-school club projects teaching students about how to save energy in smart ways. It allows all students to find, extend, or create visualizations that are meaningful to them, thereby increasing motivation and playfully providing deeper insights into the domain. Developed as a meta-design environment, users can build upon provided seeds [12] and collaborate to create meaningful representations of energy usage. The existing crowd-sourced studies are going to be combined with data and ethnographic observations of eViz users. Using eViz in after-school clubs allows me to observe and analyze long-term effects of the groups X  activities and expressed opinions on individuals X  perception of the energy domain without the artificial extrinsic motivation common in class activities. Students are free to explore and create as much or as little as they like  X  giving aan accurate picture of how different aspects of eViz impact motivation. In brief, I am trying to answer th e following the research questions in my PhD research: 1. What is the influence of the environment  X  culturally as well as 2. Can a meta-design approach help to provide environments that I would like to thank the Center for Lifelong Learning and Design (L3D), especially my advisor Gerhard Fischer.
