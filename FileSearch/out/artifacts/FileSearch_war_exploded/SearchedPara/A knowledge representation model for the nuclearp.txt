 1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) based tools are increasingly being used for knowledge representation applications in many domain fields. One of these fields is the knowledge representation of physical systems. Several knowl-edge representation approaches used for modeling physical systems can be found in the literature. Some of these approaches include qualitative physics, fault trees, Bayesian belief networks (BBN), artificial neural net-works (ANN), and hybrid models.

The area of qualitative physics is about how things work, including (1) the representational primitives for the significant features of devices and their behavior; (2) given a physical artifact, how do we construct a description of how that artifact works and (3) how do we use this description to perform interesting tasks like diagnosis. The multilevel flow model (MFM) is an interesting qualitative physics technique that can be used to represent physical systems [13] .
An MFM model is a normative description of a system, a representation of what it has been designed to do, how it should do it, and with what it should do it. The three basic concept types of MFM are: goals, functions, and physical components.

The goals are the objectives or purposes of the system, i.e., the ends that the constructors and operators want the system to reach. The functions are the means by which the goals are obtained, i.e., the powers or capabilities of the system. The physical components are what the system is constructed from (i.e., the equip-ment of which it consists of).

MFM describes the functional structure of a system as a set of interrelated flow structures on different abstraction levels. The types of flow structures treated in MFM include: mass, momentum and energy flows.
The mass, momentum and energy flow functions treated in MFM include source, transport, barrier, storage, balance, and sink.

MFM models have been applied in many physical systems, including not only industrial systems (e.g. [14] ) but also the medical diagnosis field (e.g. [15] ).

Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) are increasingly being used as a way to represent physical systems. For-mally, BBNs [15] are graphs like that of Fig. 14 . Each node represents a random variable, or uncertain quan-tity, which can have various possible values or states. The arrows signify the existence of influences between variables, and the strengths of these influences are quantified by conditional probabilities. The structure of a
BBN can be determined by assigning a node to each variable X i and connecting with arrows all other variables assumed to influence it. The strengths of these influences are then quantified by assigning to each node X i a link matrix, which represents judgmental estimates of the conditional probabilities of X i given any value com-bination of the nodes set linked to it. In Fig. 14 , X1 is influenced by X2 and X3. Therefore, X1 is called child node and X2 and X3 are called parents of X1.

In a BBN framework, each node receives permanent license to act whenever a certain condition develops among its neighbors. When changes in the state probability of a node occur, the impact of these changes is viewed as a perturbation that propagates through the network via message-passing between parent and child nodes. This means that the links in the network are instruments that direct and propel the flow of data through a process of updating node states probabilities. This message-passing mechanism is governed by the laws of Bayesian theory.

In the example in Fig. 14 , suppose that each node has two states: State1 and State2. The strengths of the influences among X1, X2 and X3 are set by assigning to X1 a link matrix that represents estimates of the con-ditional probabilities of the states of X1 given any value combination of the states of X2 and X3. The prob-abilities that X1 is in State1 and State2 are calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2) , respectively. The link matrix for X1 is shown in Table 7 . The values set in this matrix are then used on Eqs. (1) and (2) to estimate the likelihood that X1 is in State1 or State2.

Various BBN-based knowledge representation models can be found in the literature. Kim and Seaong [16] used a BBN approach to develop a method for knowledge-driven monitoring and situation assessment in nuclear power plants. In the BBN developed, each node represents system symptoms (e.g., decrease in the pressurizer level, increase in containment radiation, etc.) that indicate the occurrence of an abnormal condition (e.g, LOCA), and the connections between the nodes represent the causal relationship among them.
 Dahll [17] used a BBN approach to combine disparate sources of information in the safety assessment of
NPP software-based systems. The approach was based on experience gained through the licensing process of a programmable system in a Swedish NPP, where a guideline for reviewing software in safety-related systems was applied. Their motivation was that the approval of a programmable safety critical system is based on a combination of disparate sources of information. They used a BBN to represent the link between basic infor-mation and the confidence one can have in a system.

Lee and Lee [18] developed an approximate probabilistic inference program for nuclear waste disposal facil-ities using BBN. The objective was to improve the current knowledge base for the prioritization of future risk-dominant variables in an actual site. They developed specific models, including a model for uncertainty prop-agation of relevant parameters with a comparison of variable-specific effects due to the occurrence of different scenarios. They collected supporting information to get a variety of quantitative expectations about the depen-dency relationship between domain variables and used this information to build the BBN.

Despite the advantages of modeling physical systems using BBNs, artificial neural networks (ANN) are probably the most adopted technique. Varde et al. [19] provides various references in the application of
ANN in the field of nuclear power generation. For example, Choi et al. [21] proposed an ANN-based accident simulation methodology for nuclear power plants. Their objective was to enhance the capabilities of compact simulators that are used as alternatives for more robust full scale simulators. They used ANNs as a bridge between detailed computer codes and compact simulators aiming to improve the capabilities of the compact simulators. They claim that the ANNs compensate for the inaccuracies of the compact simulators X  assump-tions (i.e., simplified governing equation, reduced number of physical control volumes, etc.).
Pasquet and Chatelet [20] used a neural network approach to identify failure scenarios of a system that must maintain the temperature of a circulating liquid within an acceptable range. The study of this system used a modular approach, which is based on a system description with flow diagrams. The approach was used to simplify the study of dynamic systems using coupled dynamic equations. Each dynamic equation associated to a component or subsystem is replaced by a neural network. Then, the individual neural networks are con-nected according to the flow diagram structure. The physical variables that provide the coupling between the components are associated to the links of the diagram.

Mjalli et al. [22] used an ANN as a black-box modeling approach to acquire the knowledge base of a real wastewater plant and then used it as a process model. A computer model was developed that incorporates the trained ANN plant model. The developed program is implemented and validated using plant scale data obtained from a wastewater treatment plant, and is used as a performance assessment tool for plant operators and decision makers.

Fault tree analysis [23,24] is another technique that also has applicability in the knowledge representation field. Mau et al. [25] adopted a fault tree approach to develop a prototype of a diagnostic expert system to act as a trouble-shooting consultant for batch reactors to plant operators. The expert advisory system simulates the bench-scale batch reactor system. The bench scale batch reactor contains 24 sensors, measuring temper-atures, pressure, flow rate and level. The controller scans the sensors every 5 s and the data is stored. The external file is then input into the Batch expert advisory system.

Finally, it is not uncommon to find the application of a combination of techniques to represent physical systems. This approach is particularly adopted when the advantages of one technique overcome the disadvan-tages of another. The literature provides many publications in the use of ANN with other techniques to rep-resent physical systems (e.g., [26 X 31] ).

For example, Ruiz et al. [27,28] proposed a fault diagnosis system, which consisted of an ANN structure supplemented with a knowledge based expert system (KBES) in a block-oriented configuration. The system combines the adaptive learning diagnostic procedure of the ANN and the transparent deep knowledge rep-resentation of the KBES. The KBES is composed of data from a historical database, a hazard and opera-bility (HAZOP) analysis and a model of the chemical plant, which is compiled in the form of production rules.

Varde et al. [19] used an ANN and a probabilistic safety analysis based knowledge base to model an oper-ator support system for nuclear power plants. The system integrates features of ANN and the rule based approach. The ANN acts as the watch dog system for monitoring the plant state. The knowledge based system carries out fault diagnosis and procedure generation during normal and abnormal conditions.
Many of the techniques discussed above were used to represent physical systems in the nuclear power gen-eration domain [12] . On the other hand, none of them seems to be capable of providing a detailed represen-tation of the mass, momentum and energy flow within the system.

The main objective of this study is to design the knowledge base (KB) of a nuclear power plant X  X  (NPP) control room operator. Such KB stores problem-solving related knowledge obtained from training and expe-rience and, therefore, must be able to provide a detailed description of the mass, momentum and energy flow within the system.

One important characteristic of a NPP system is the complexity of the system itself. There may be hundreds of components (e.g., pumps, valves, pipes, heat exchangers, steam generators, etc.) distributed in a complex architecture. Also, the control panel contains several sources of information (i.e., alarms, pressure indicators, coolant flow indicators, temperature indicators, radiation indicators, etc.) that indicate the system X  X  status. The operator is required to integrate and interpret this information during normal and abnormal situations.
A human-thinking basis for the integration of these sources of information is the production rules approach [7] . However, given the physical complexity of the system, modeling the operator X  X  KB using production rules explicitly would be a very hard task and time prohibitive. This paper proposes a mechanism to construct pro-duction rules that will reduce the labor demanded to model the operator X  X  KB. 2. The model
According to Dearnley and Smith [3] , the process of modeling a KB involves producing a logical design, which represents the chunks of knowledge stored, and then mapping this logical design into a physical design for a specific system. The physical design is concerned with the representation and provision of access paths among the chunks [4] .

One of the chunks of knowledge that comprise the operator X  X  KB is composed by the understanding of the physical design of the plant. The physical design is represented by rules that map the information with each other, which have the following form [1] :  X  IF A is TRUE and B is TRUE ... and X is TRUE.  X  THEN Y is also TRUE.

In practice, the explicit use of IF-THEN rules to model human KBs in a complex system like a NPP requires a huge number of rules. This Section presents a generalized IF-THEN mapping function that makes the KB more economic in size, without affecting completeness.

According to Wang [10] , neural networks can provide a mapping function that can be substituted for all of the production rules and thus constitute a KB. Indeed, connectionist methods like neural networks provide a better model of human-like reasoning [2] . The generalized IF-THEN mapping function proposed resembles a neural network and has the format shown in Fig. 1 below.

In Fig. 1 , A, B, C and D are nodes that represent chunks of information stored in the KB. The activation of A, B and C influences the activation of D. strength of activation (SA) is the degree in which one node influences the activation of the other (e.g., SA(AD) is the degree in which the activation of A influences the activation of D). St is the status of the node and can have two possible states:  X  X  X ctivated X  X  (St(NODE) = 1) or  X  X  X ot activated X  X  (St(NODE) = 0). Th is a threshold value that determines wether the status of the node is  X  X  X ctivated X  X  or  X  X  X ot activated X  X .

The generalized production rule function is used to calculate the status of D (i.e., St(D)), and it X  X  formu-lation will depend on the logic structure desired. Examples of common logic structures are the  X  X  X ND X  X  and  X  X  X R X  X  structures. Suppose that in Fig. 1 , D is activated only if all of its input nodes (i.e, A  X  X  X ND X  X  B  X  X  X ND X  X  C) are also activated. The generalized production rule function for this logic structure is: where, SA(AD) = SA(BD) = SA(CD) = 1, and Th = 2. Therefore, if St(A) = 0, and St(B) = 1 and St(C) = 1, the threshold condition is not satisfied and St(D) = 0. Alternatively, if D is activated only if either one of its input nodes is activated (i.e., A  X  X  X R X  X  B  X  X  X R X  X  C), then Th = 0.

Eq. (3) can have many variations depending on the logic structure of interest. For example, if D is activated only if one of its input nodes is activated, the generalized production rule function is shown in Eq. (4) . In Eq. (4) , SA(AD) = SA(BD) = SA(CD) = 1, and Th = 1.
Finally, suppose that D is activated if at least 2 out of the 3 nodes connected to it are activated. Modeling this kind of logic structure by using production rules explicitly would result in the following set of rules: IF: (1) A and B are activated; OR (2) A and C are activated; OR (3) B and C are activated; OR (4) A and B and C are activated; THEN: D is activated.

In this case, if the number of input nodes is increased, the number of production rules increases exponen-tially. In other words, using production rules to model k out of N logic structures results in a combinatorial explosion of IF-THEN rules. By using Eq. (3) and making Th = k, the combinatorial explosion is eliminated.
The generalized production rule function proposed is very convenient for modeling the KB of a NPP X  X  oper-ator. It can be applied to represent: (1) the physical design of nuclear power generation systems (i.e., how the com-ponents are connected to each other), and (2) the transfer of mass, momentum and energy within components.
A NPP is characterized by complex interactions among components, which may involve hundreds of com-ponents transporting mass, momentum and energy through them. The result of this complexity is that one particular scenario can be affected by tens of (or even more) components. In other words, for a given event outcome, different factors may play important roles according to different operating status (e.g., power level, reactor operational transients, reactor scram, etc.), which changes dynamically.

In order to apply the generalized production rule to a NPP system, each component in the system (i.e., pumps, valves, steam generators, pipes, etc.) is represented by a node. The nodes and the connections among them are characterized by attributes that determine if there is mass, momentum and/or energy transfer between the nodes. Each node has the following parameters: (1) Mass transfer threshold (Th_Ma)  X  determines whether there is mass transfer between nodes. (2) Momentum transfer threshold (Th_Mo)  X  determines whether there is momentum transfer between (3) Energy transfer threshold (Th_E)  X  determines whether there is energy transfer between nodes. (4) State of component X(St(X))  X  The state can have the values of 0 or 1. For different components, the state (5) Mass transfer signal (Ma_X)  X  determines whether mass is being transferred to component X. Mass can (6) Momentum transfer signal (Mo_X)  X  determines whether momentum is being transferred to component (7) Energy transfer signal (E_X)  X  determines whether energy is being transferred to component X. The following paragraphs show two examples of how the generalized production rule can be applied in a
NPP system. The first example shows an application of the proposed method in a simplified auxiliary feed water system and the second shows an application of the proposed method in a simplified containment spray system. 2.1. Auxiliary feed water system
Fig. 2 shows a turbine driven auxiliary feed water pump (TDAFW_P) receiving water either from the con-densate storage tank (CST) or from the service water system (SSW) and supplying coolant to the SGs. The
TDAFW_P is powered by steam supplied either by the steam generator 1 (SG 1) or by the steam generator 2 (SG 2).
 Fig. 3 shows the system of Fig. 2 in a network format. V1 is connected to two different sources of mass: the
SWS and the CST. Assuming that the SWS and the CST are sources of mass only, there is only one connection between SWS and V1, and between CST and V1, which indicates that there is only mass transfer between these nodes. In this case, the mass transfer is governed only by the availability of inventory in either one of the mass sources. Therefore, one can apply Eq. (3) to determine whether there is mass transfer between the two sources and V1, as shown in Eq. (5) (the strengths of activation for these connections are one).
 one (i.e., Ma_V1 = 1). The same reasoning can be applied to V2, V3 and V4 (see Table 2 ).
 The mass transfer from V3 and V4 to V5 depends on the mass availability in V3 and V4 (i.e., Ma_V3 and Ma_V4) and on their states (i.e., St(V3) and St_(V4)). Assuming that steam either from the SG1 or the SG2 would suffice to drive the TDAFW_P, Ma_V5 will be set to one if Eq. (6) is satisfied. In Eq. (6) , Ma_V3 and Ma_V4 are the strength of activations.

TDAFW_P requires water supply either from V1 or V2, and steam from V5. Since the TDAFW_P must nec-essarily receive steam from V5, the strength of activation between V5 and the TDAFW_P is multiplied by two (i.e., 2Ma_V5), and the threshold value is equal to 2.

V6 is the output node of the TDAFW_P, which is a source of mass and momentum. The two connections between these nodes represent mass and momentum transfer between them. If the TDAFW_P is working properly, there will be mass and momentum transfer between these nodes. Otherwise, if the pump is not work-ing properly, there will be no mass and no momentum transfer between them (in reality there will be a small transfer of water, which is not enough to maintain the proper function of the system). Therefore, V6 has two equations: one that determines whether there is mass transfer, and another that determines whether there is momentum transfer. In this case, St(TDAFW_P) equals to zero when a malfunction causes the pump to not to work properly (e.g., leakage) and it does not include the case in which there is not steam supply to drive the turbine. 2.2. Containment spray system
Fig. 4 shows the heat exchanger (Hx) of a containment spray system receiving inventory from the refueling water storage tank and supplying cooled water to the spray header. Fig. 5 shows the containment spray system in a network format.

The equations for the pumps and valves are shown in Table 3 . It is assumed that if any one of the pumps is not working, it will block the mass flow. In order to have mass and momentum transfer from the pumps to the valves, the status and mass signals of each pump must be one.

Assuming that water must be available in two out of the three trains of Fig. 4 , the rules for mass and momentum transfer to the heat exchanger are shown in Eqs. (7) and (8) , respectively. The mass, momentum and energy transfer from the heat exchanger to the spray header depends on the status and availability of mass and momentum in the heat exchanger (Eqs. (9) X (11) ).

Note that, if the status of the heat exchanger is zero (i.e., disabled due to, for example, failure of component cooling water system) the containment spray header will still get mass and momentum, but there will be no energy transfer. 3. Example of application
This section shows an example of application of the proposed knowledge representation model. The exam-ple considers a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) scenario in which all the efforts to cool the core were not suc-cessful and so core damage has occurred. The objective is to prevent the accident from breaching the containment boundary (e.g., emission of fission products to the atmosphere). According to the Severe Acci-dent Management Guide [11] , the courses of actions followed by the operators include, among other things: (1) Inject coolant into the steam generators (SG). This is done in order (1) to protect the steam generator (2) Depressurize the RCS. This is done in order (1) to prevent high pressure melt ejection, (2) to prevent (3) Inject coolant into the RCS. This is done in order (1) to remove stored energy from the core when it has (4) Inject into the containment. This is done in order (1) to establish external vessel cooling, which can delay
The Severe Accident Management Guidance entry point suggests that various attempts to prevent core melt have failed. The guide simply tells the operators to keep trying procedures that may have failed before, and to analyze the impacts before implementing them. The use of the Containment Spray System is one of them. Fig. 6 shows a simplified representation of the Containment Spray System of the Comanche Peak Steam
Electric Station. The objective of the system is to transport cool water to the spray headers. The sources of coolant are either the RWST or the containment sump. If the RWST is available, the heat exchangers are not needed since the water in the RWST is already sufficiently cool. Once the RWST is depleted, the system must be placed in the recirculation mode (i.e., water is supplied by the containment sumps). In this case cool-ing water must be supplied to the secondary side of the heat exchangers in order to prevent continued heating of the water and eventual overpressure of the containment.

As with most NPP systems, the Containment Spray System of Fig. 6 is single failure proof. In this example it is assumed that if CSP_1 and CSP_2 fail, CSP_3 and/or CSP_4 would suffice to transport coolant to both trains A and B. Also, if the system is in recirculation mode, one heat exchanger would suffice to attend both spray headers.
 The piping that includes motor operated valves VM_4, VM_5, VM_6 and VM_7, and check valves Chk_3,
Chk_4, Chk_5 and Chk_6, connects the pumps to the RWST. These are mini flow lines (i.e., small diameter piping), and should be closed during normal operation (i.e., VM_4, VM_5, VM_6 and VM_7 are closed). Yet, if either VM_4, VM_5, VM_6 or VM_7 fails open, the flow back to the RWST would be very small and would not impair the success of the system.
 The knowledge representation methodology was applied to the system of Fig. 6 . The model was built in a Microsoft Excel spread sheet and is shown in Fig. 7 . In this figure, each component of the system shown in
Fig. 6 is represented by 5 cells, as shown in the legend in the lower left corner of the Figure. The first cell (from top to bottom) displays the state of the component. The second cell displays the name of the component. The third cell displays the mass transfer signal of the component. The fourth cell displays the momentum transfer signal of the component. The fifth cell displays the energy transfer signal of the component.
Note that the connection between some of the components has mass transfer only. For other components, there are mass, momentum and energy transfer. It is assumed that if the status of any one of the pumps is zero, the pump blocks the transfer of mass, momentum and/or energy. In addition, depending on the status of the system, V9 and V10 enable flow in both ways. However, the knowledge representation method does not allow circular reference. Therefore, V9 and V10 are not assigned mass, momentum and energy equations, but their statuses are used in other components X  equations. For simplification purposes, the example does not include pipes. The  X  X  X eturn X  X  node represents the return of mass, momentum and/or energy back to the RWST.

The equations for each component of the Containment Spray System are shown in Table 4 . According to the equations, any change in the state of the component (the first cell), would affect the mass, momentum and or energy imparted to other components and to the spray headers. Fig. 7 shows a situation in which the spray headers are being supplied by the RWST. In this case, the heat exchangers are not necessary, and, therefore, the status of both heaters is zero. All the pumps are running and all the valves connecting the RWST and the spray headers are open. Note also in Fig. 7 that the VM_8 and VM_9 are closed, which means the system is not in recirculation mode.

Suppose that, after the Severe Accident Management Guidance X  X  entry point has been reached, the oper-ators decide to reduce the containment X  X  temperature by injecting coolant into the containment. In order to do that they need to investigate the availability of suction sources and feed paths. Assume that during the attempt to start the Containment Spray System the operators find out that VM_1 failed closed. By searching their knowledge base, the operators conclude that if VM_1 is closed, the spray headers are not receiving any cool-ant, as shown in Fig. 8 .In Fig. 8 the status of VM_1 is zero. VM_1 is the main valve that connects the RWST to the two trains supplying coolant to the spray headers. Since VM_1 is closed, no coolant is being transferred to the spray headers. Note in Fig. 8 that despite the status of the pumps and valves in both trains is one, their mass, momentum and/or energy transfer signals are 0. As a consequence, the mass, momentum and energy transfer signals of header 1 and header 2 are zero.

Assume that the operators opt to try finding another source of coolant. They, then, decide to start the recir-culation mode by opening VM_8 and VM_9, and turning Hx_1 and Hx_2 on. These changes on the system X  X  configuration would then allow cool water to the spray headers, as shown in Fig. 9 . Note that in this example, cooling flow to the heat exchangers is represented as simply  X  X  X n X  X  or  X  X  X ff X  X . In a full application, the CCWS would also be represented by a network and equations.

Consider that, for an unknown reason, CSP_3 and CSP_4 trip, and all attempts to restart at least one of them failed. The operators then recognize that the spray header of train B is not being supplied by cool water ( Fig. 10 ). According to their knowledge base, they understand that train A and train B are con-nected by V9 and V10, and that by opening these valves cool water from train A will flow to train B ( Fig. 11 ). 4. Discussion
This paper provides a study on how human domain knowledge can be simulated, which is considered an area of research for the new millennium [9] . In the particular case of human reliability engineering, it is of great interest to have methods to model the KB of humans in domain applications like nuclear power plants [8] , and fire safety applications [5] .
 Modeling the KB of a NPP X  X  control room operator is a very challenging area. Ideally, the contents of the
KB should be [6] : (1) The functional and physical characteristics of the system and its underlying processes. (2) General technical knowledge of relevant scientific and engineering principles (e.g., breach of integrity of (3) Knowledge of past events in terms of cause, mechanisms, path of propagation, operator actions (suc-(4)  X  X  X ules of thumb X  X , workarounds, shortcuts, and other less formalized approaches for solving problems (5) Expected response of system to perturbations, learned through training and operating experience. (6) General guidelines on how to respond to accidents, knowledge of available options, memorized proce-
The knowledge representation model presented contributes to the first item only. Nevertheless, in nuclear power plants, and with other systems, the operators are concerned with quantitative values of the system variables, trends and uncertainties. In the examples discussed the components had binary states (i.e., either working or not working). In reality, a component may have many possible states, such as completely not working or partially working to fulfill its 10%, 20%, etc. of its designated functions. For a pump, it can work tionality of the components of interest.

The proposed method can be adapted to capture the fuzzy character of the components X  functionality. In order to do so, instead of propagating binary signals indicating whether there is or there is not mass, momen-tum and energy transfer, the nodes will propagate quantitative values that indicate the approximate amount of mass, momentum and energy that is transferred from one component to another. As a consequence, the threshold values are used to determine the approximate amount of mass, momentum and energy transfer among components, and the strength of activation values are no longer necessary.

Take as an example the simplified CSS shown in Fig. 12 .In Fig. 12 , the quantity, pressure and temperature of coolant supplied to the spray header will depend on the status of each component. For simplification pur-poses, the example considers the following simplification assumptions: (1) Both pumps have identical discharge capacity ( D c ) and pressure ( D (2) The status of the heat exchanger (St(Hx)) is used to represent leaks in the heat exchanger. For example, (3) The amount of coolant that flows in train 1 (V1, CSP_1 and V3) and train 2 (V2, CSP_2 and V4) is pro-(4) When 100% open, each valve can provide with a maximum discharge of D (5) For each train, if the discharge falls below half of the capacity of its respective pump, the pump shuts off (6) The pumps are the only sources of momentum, and, therefore, the system X  X  pressure before the pumps is
Fig. 13 shows the system of Fig. 12 in a network format. As Fig. 13 shows, in order to adapt the proposed model to capture the fuzzy character of the components X  functionality, special nodes are needed. The special shows the mass, momentum and energy equations for all the components and special nodes of the system shown in Fig. 12 . Some components don X  X  require the equation for mass, momentum and/or energy. These cases are shown in Table 6 .

As Table 5 shows,  X  X  MaxTrain1  X  X  and  X  X  MaxTrain2  X  X  determines the maximum discharge that trains 1 and 2 permit.  X  X  Train1  X  X  and  X  X  Train2  X  X  determines the amount of coolant that flows through trains 1 and 2 without taking into account assumption 4 listed above.  X  X  ActualTrain1  X  X  and  X  X  ActualTrain2  X  X  determines the actual amount of coolant that flows through trains 1 and 2 by considering assumption 4.

Another point of concern is that society (through the safety regulatory system) has shown little tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty, which is the reason for extensive proceduralization of anticipated safety-related operational responses within nuclear power plants. During normal and emergency situations, the operators are not allowed to be creative. In other words, they are not allowed to use less formalized approaches, or make decisions based on past experience. They are trained and expected to follow procedures.

On the other hand, there are abnormal situations in which there is no formal procedure to be followed. The application presented in Section 3 is one example. The Severe Accident Management Guide is not a typical procedure, where there is not too much cognitive demand. It is a thought process that guides the operators to make decisions in order to prevent the situation from breaching the containment boundary. It gives the operators a lot of freedom to think before settling on courses of actions.

Before deciding on injecting into the SG the operators need to identify and evaluate negative impacts like thermal shock of the SG (i.e., wide range level of the SG is less than a certain limit), fission product release leaking from the SG X  X  tubes, and creep rupture (i.e., if the SG wide range level is less than certain limit and RCS pressure is greater than the SG pressure). In order to mitigate thermal shock, the operators may decide (1) to limit flow to the SG to a certain level during the first minutes of injection, and/or (2) to feed only one dry SG at a time to minimize consequences of SG X  X  tube failure until the minimum wide range of the SG X  X  level is indicated, and/or (3) to feed only the isolatable SGs to minimize consequences of SG X  X  tube failure.
In order to mitigate the fission product release from leaking SG X  X  tubes (i.e., faulted SG), the operators may decide (1) to feed/steam only to intact SGs (to prevent pressure buildup in the faulted SG, which would cause a release through the SG safety valves), and/or (2) to depressurize the RCS to minimize primary to secondary leakage.

In order to minimize creep rupture of the SG X  X  tubes, the operators may decide (1) to establish feed flow as soon as possible once the SG X  X  pressure is below the shutoff head of the feed source, and/or (2) to depressurize the RCS.

The proposed model could be used to develop specific production rules to capture this kind of creative knowledge. Nevertheless, given the complexity of a NPP system, different particular scenarios can be affected by tens of (or even more) factors. The description of these scenarios using the current approach would prob-ably require several nodes and connections. Current research is being carried out to investigate the feasibility of the current model to simulate the operator X  X  creative thought process. The objective is to develop generic rules to capture various scenarios and to limit the complexity and size of the network. 5. Conclusion
The Achillies X  Heal of expert systems is the inordinately large number of rules that one has to write for any-thing but the simplest systems. Usually, people write programs with over 1000 if-then rules and still not cover all the possible configurations of a relative simple system. Generally, the solution is to go to  X  X  X uzzy X  X  rules.
This paper presents an alternate approach (i.e., make the system generate its own rules). It outlines a way of presenting the logical structure of a system, such that the status of the system could be tracked and pre-sented to a human.
 The proposed model was used to represent and simulate the containment spray system of the Comanche
Peak Steam Electric Station. The simulation involved various scenarios of realistic fault situations typical of nuclear power plants. The accuracy of the predictions provided by the algorithm was analyzed by experts in the field. The conclusion was that the algorithm worked accurately, managed to handle multiple fault sce-narios without problems and gave correct and useful information. Furthermore, it is believed that the level of detail provided by the proposed model would be hard to achieve by using other knowledge representation techniques.

For instance, the major disadvantage of MFM in designing nuclear power plant (and other) systems knowl-edge representation is the binary nature of its functions. For example, the barrier function (refer to the Intro-duction section) represents the capability of a system to prevent the transfer of mass, energy or momentum from one part of the system to another. Typical examples of barrier functions are provided by traps in water systems, heat isolating materials, closed valves, non functioning pumps, etc. A barrier function is characterized by a throughput flow, which should be close or equal to zero. However, in most systems, including nuclear power plants, there are many components (e.g., valves) that may function as a partial barrier, as it is modeled by the proposed method.

In other words, MFM would probably never be able to help diagnosing the incident occurred on December 8th, 1991 at the Crystal River Unit 3 power station. Previous to the accident, the plant was starting up after a maintenance outage. The system was about 10% power preparing to roll the main turbine when the crew per-ceived indications of a slow loss of rector coolant system (RCS) pressure. The cause of this condition (unknown to the control room crew) was a failure in the actuator of the pressurizer spray line control valve
RCV-14. This valve was actually partially open, while indicators showed it was closed. During the event all the efforts to control the pressure by the operators did not work. The cause of the situation remained unknown to the crew until the spray line isolation valve RCV-13 (which is in series with RCV-14) was closed.
Another disadvantage is that an MFM operates on discrete data in the form of logical systems (e.g., nor-mal-temperature, low temperature, and high-temperature) while the sensor values coming from the control room of a nuclear power plant are continuous and contain disturbances, noise, and even serious faults (similar to the faulty indicator in the Crystal River incident). Therefore, it is not trivial to convert the raw data to the reliable, symbolic information the current MFM methodology needs [15] . Oppositely, the method proposed here can be fed with the raw continuous data.

BBNs also have disadvantages that prevent them from providing the level of detail proposed here. Despite its capability of representing partial dependence and partial independence, BBNs rely heavily on data from past systems behavior, expert judgment, etc., as was shown by the models of Dahll [17] and Lee and Lee [18] discussed above. Such information is used not only to determine child and parent nodes but also to build the link matrix. Relying on such information is useful to prevent incidents and accidents from happening again, but it is not of much help in foreseeing scenarios never experienced before. With extra effort, the fol-lowing generations of the proposed method could be used as a laboratory to foresee scenarios unfamiliar to us.
For example, if a system represented by the proposed method is implemented in a simulation environment that varies the states of the system X  X  components (e.g., using a Monte Carlo simulation) and the system X  X  behavior is recorded, interesting and unthinkable scenarios may emerge.
Additionally, in order for a BBN approach to achieve the level of detail provided by the proposed method, each node would have to have various states (e.g., a valve would need various states representing how much mass, momentum and/or energy flows through it), which would cause a combinatorial explosion of the link matrix. The use of BBNs to represent complex systems like a NPP is restricted to the system level as shown in [16] .
Similar to BBNs, the major drawback of the ANN approach to model physical systems is that it uses infor-mation like historical data of systems behavior and expert judgment in the training process. Training an ANN with such information is useful for predicting already experienced system behavior. However, it is also impor-tant to be able to predict unforeseen system behavior as is intended by the proposed method.

Another significant problem in all the ANN models discussed above is the fact that the data that flow in input to one node are the output prediction of another node connected to the first one, according to the system flow. Since the ANN predictions are affected by approximation errors, the cumulating overall error may tend to diverge. Other drawbacks of ANN based methods are long training times, difficulty in symbolic knowledge extraction from the trained network, and the need for considerable training data [22] .

Similarly, fault trees share the same disadvantages of all the techniques discussed so far. Modeling complex systems like NPPs, where there maybe hundreds or even thousands of components and sensors (as opposed to the work of Mau et al. [25] ), the fault tree would generate an explosive number of behaviors. Nevertheless, a well-designed knowledge based system should be able to avoid generating such a combinatorially explosive number of behaviors and still remain responsive to the many combinations of events that are possible [26] , as was accomplished in the example of Fig. 12 .

Furthermore, besides its disadvantage of representing only binary component states (discussed previously), fault trees are static by nature. When any of the cut sets are triggered, it is assumed that the top event is also triggered immediately. However, in real life accidents and incidents, there is a time interval between a failure or condition and an undesirable event.

Finally, even though combining the techniques discussed above has the advantage of overcoming each oth-ers weak points, none of the techniques seems to be capable of providing the level of detail and the advantages of the proposed method. Although the approach is still in its early stages, this article has shown that it can be applied to realistic systems in nuclear power plants.
 Current research is being conducted on the application of the method on other systems like chemical plants.
So far, it is known that depending on the particular characteristics of the system, the node connections would have a distinct architecture, but the principle behind the node connections, and the rationale used to construct the production rule equations remain unaltered.

It is not expected that this generation of the technique proposed will show up in the control rooms of nuclear or chemical plants in the near future, but two or three generations later, this approach could provide an alternate approach that is deterministic (i.e., not  X  X  X uzzy X  X ). The NRC has never, to the best of this author X  X  knowledge, allowed a  X  X  X uzzy X  X  system in the control system of a plant.
