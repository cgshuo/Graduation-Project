 Abstract. Nonprofessional creation of public online content has out-stripped professional content creation of all forms, both online and of-fline. And two orders of magnitude more content is created daily to flow through social networks, with as much as two more orders of magni-tude still to come as user engagement increases. Content is diversifying in creation, consumption, and nature. Web search engines provide rapid targeted access to this page content, and increasingly to other informa-tion such as news articles, weather, movie showtimes, and product and restaurant listings. In this talk, I X  X l discuss these trends from the stand-point of the search engine, I X  X l cover some research results in this area, and I X  X l close with some challenges for the future.
