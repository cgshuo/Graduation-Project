 This paper proposes a relational-learning based approach for discovering strategies in volleyball matches based on optical tracking data. In contrast to most existing methods, our ap-proach permits discovering patterns that account for both spatial (that is, partial configurations of the players on the court) and temporal (that is, the order of events and posi-tions) aspects of the game. We analyze both the men X  X  and women X  X  final match from the 2014 FIVB Volleyball World Championships, and are able to identify several interesting and relevant strategies from the matches.
 Sports analytics, Spatial data, Strategy detection
Optical tracking enables analyses that go beyond descrip-tive statistics based on event data by providing sufficient context about the game state such that it is possible to gain insights into tactics and strategies. However, auto-matically detecting and understanding tactics in dynamic sports such as volleyball is a challenging problem as tactics comprise complex interactions among multiple players that evolve across both time and space. Hence, strategy detec-tion must consider and evaluate a huge number of possible spatio-temporal movement patterns. Existing approaches, which largely look at basketball and soccer, tackle this prob-lem by restricting the analysis in some way such as only con-sidering a specific strategy [9], a short time window [4], or a small subset of players [5, 3].

This paper addresses automatically discovering attacking strategies in volleyball matches based on camera-tracking data of the players and the ball as a pattern mining task [1]. Specifically, we consider the following two tasks:
Volleyball matches are won by the first team to win three sets. A set is won by the first team to score 25 points and lead by two points. However, the fifth set is typically played to only 15 points. Each set consists of rallies and one team is awarded a point at the end of each rally. A rally starts by serving the ball from behind the back-line over the net into the opponent X  X  court. The opponent may touch the ball up to three times to prevent it from hitting the court and to get the ball back over the net. A rally ends either when one of the teams makes a kill by grounding the ball on the opponent X  X  court or when a team makes a foul.

The players follow a rotation scheme, where they must rotate one time in clockwise direction after their team wins the serve. Nevertheless, players do have different roles in the team and are free to move within their half of the court af-ter the serve. Typically, the best offensive players will move towards the net, while the best defensive players will move to the back of the court. Although the rotation scheme im-poses some restrictions, this tactical freedom allows teams to adopt a wide variety of match strategies. Therefore, vol-leyball players need to master the following six basic skills: Serve The serve is the skill of moving the ball from behind Dig The dig is the defensive skill of preventing the ball from Pass The pass is very similar to the dig. However, in addi-matches, including the final matches of both tournaments. They first captured each match using 8 video cameras placed at different angles at 30 frames per second and then used their ball and player tracking code to automatically deter-mine the locations of the players and the ball in each frame. Furthermore, a human manually annotated each frame with the skills performed by the players (i.e., serve, dig, set, spike, and block) for both finals. The data set does not distinguish between digs and passes.

In this paper, we focus on the final matches of the world championships for which both the tracking information and the annotations are available. Table 1 shows the number of sets, rallies, and attacks in both matches as well as relevant statistics for each team such as the number of won rallies and how often they performed each of the skills.

We divide each rally into a series of attacks, where each attack consists of a sequence of consecutive skills performed by the same team. In this work, we only consider attacks that involve each of a dig, a set, and a spike. Based on this preprocessing, we construct positive and negative examples for four settings on each task. In task 1, the positive ex-amples are a team X  X  attacks that result in a point, while the negatives are all the team X  X  other attacks. In task 2, the pos-itives are the attacks from one team (e.g., Brazil), while the negatives are the attacks from the opponent (e.g., Poland). Table 2 lists the number of positive and negative examples for each setup.

To represent an attack, we take a snapshot of the pitch configuration at the time that a skill is performed. Each snapshot is described by the performed skill (dig, set or spike) as well as information about the location of each player and the ball. Each snapshot describes the locations on two levels of granularities: high-level zones (see Figure 1 left) and lower-level positions (see Figure 1 right).
Pattern mining typically focuses on finding patterns that occur frequently (that is, many times) in the data. Our problem has several other important characteristics that we must account for and which distinguish it from standard pattern mining. First, each of our tasks requires differen-tiating between two classes of examples, either successful and unsuccessful attacks or attacks done by two different teams. Second, we want to be able to simultaneously rea-son about multiple different levels of granularity in the data. For example, we may want to represent the court with both high-level zones and lower-level positions as illustrated in Figure 1. Furthermore, we would like to be able to discover patterns that involve specific players in a specific position as well as patterns that involve any player in a specific po-sition. Third, this problem is inherently relational and it is crucial to find patterns that account for relationships such as changes over time. For example, we may want to know how the configuration of players changes between a dig and a set. Finally, we have specific knowledge about the game of volleyball and we would like to be able to incorporate it into the pattern mining process.

Based on the above requirements, we pursue an approach based on inductive logic programming (ILP) [6]. ILP is a relational learning approach that permits modeling multi-ple granularities, capturing relationships, and incorporating Even with our constraints, a huge number of patterns were generated. For task 1, there were 53,212 patterns gener-ated for Brazil, 79,907 for Poland, 51,593 for China, and 77,509 for the USA. For task 2, there were 190,956 patterns generated for Brazil, 197,467 for Poland, 269,753 for China, and 327,731 for the USA. We post processed the patterns and only retained those that included all three skills (dig, set, and spike) we were interested in. This resulted in 1,527 patterns for Brazil, 1,301 for Poland, 242 for China, and 2,037 for the USA in task 1. For task 2, there were 65,484 patterns generated for Brazil, 41,763 for Poland, 73,011 for China, and 84,639 for the USA.

Then, we ranked the patterns by the number of specific players and locations the patterns contained. This enforces a preference for longer, more specific patterns. We broke ties by considering pattern coverage (number of positives the pattern applies to), pattern precision, and pattern length.
We present the top-ranked pattern for each of the eight setups we consider. Most of these patterns capture the same offensive strategy, which involves attacking over one side of the court. The patterns do have some small variations, such as about whether the attack is on the left or right side. This attacking pattern is a well-known volleyball strategy. Next, we discuss the top-ranked pattern in each setup in more detail.
 team was much more successful in this location than in the zone in general. The Polish team was less successful from this specific location, attempting 15 spikes of which 10 were successful. Also, in contrast to the women X  X  final, the USA and China only attempted four spikes in aggregate in this specific location and none of them were successful.

Figure 4 shows the top-ranked pattern for the USA wo-men X  X  team. This again illustrates an attack from the side of the court at the front. Given that player B spikes the ball and the ball is located in the front left zone, that is the location where the spike was performed. Notice that a player denoted A moves from the left middle to the left front between the dig and the set. Thus, the setter could have set to either side for the spike. The pattern covers five successful attacks and no unsuccessful ones. The USA attempted 56 spikes in the front right zone of which 37 were successful (including the five covered by this pattern) and 19 were unsuccessful.

Figure 5 shows the top-ranked pattern for the China wo-men X  X  team. This pattern is less specific than the previous three, but it still shows the same general scheme of attacking from the side of the court on the front. Given that the ball is in the front rightmost corner next to the net at the time of the spike, we can infer that this is where player 8 is located. The pattern covers five successful attacks and no unsuccessful ones. Over all spikes in this specific position, China had eight successful spikes (including the five covered by this pattern) and two unsuccessful ones.
 Figures 6 through 9 show the offensive patterns that distin-guish between two teams playing against each other. The patterns are illustrated in the same manner as for Task 1. Figure 6 shows the top-ranked pattern employed by the Poland men X  X  team that is not used by the Brazilian team in their match. Figure 7 shows the top-ranked pattern for the Brazil men X  X  team that is not used by the Polish team. These patterns are quite similar, with a set in the middle and a spike by player 10 on the outside in the front. The difference is that the Polish number 10 attacks on the right and the Brazilian number 10 on the left. One possible explanation is that these players have different dominant hands. Typically in volleyball the spiker wants his dominant hand closest to where the ball is coming from (that is, right-handed players want to spike from the front left, and left-handed players want to spike from the front right). We could not verify this hypothesis.

Figure 8 shows the top-ranked pattern for the USA wo-men X  X  team that is not used by the Chinese team. Fig-ure 9 shows the top-ranked pattern for the China women X  X  team that is not used by the USA team. These patterns are slightly less informative as they do not indicate the location of the spike. All the patterns tell is that the ball is set in the front center zone.
 Another natural question to ask is how do the men X  X  and women X  X  game compare to each other. The statistics in Ta-ble 1 show that there are some commonalities between them. Namely, the number of rallies is roughly the same in both finals. However, the women X  X  match features many more denotes the location of the ball.
