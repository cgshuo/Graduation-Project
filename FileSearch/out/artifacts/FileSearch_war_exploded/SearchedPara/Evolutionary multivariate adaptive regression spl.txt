 1. Introduction
Because shear stress is the primary failure mode of reinforce-concrete (RC) deep beams ( Mansour et al., 2004 ), the behavior and design of these beams in shear mechanism is an area of concern for structural engineers. Furthermore, because concrete structures are fragile, shear failure in the plain concrete members of these structures may cause sudden structural collapse. Avoiding high-risk failure modes is thus a priority objective for civil engineers ( Amani and Moeini, 2012 ). Based on the above, the ability to accurately estimate the shear strength of RC deep beams is critical to the safe and widespread application of these beams in con-struction projects.

Technical manuals published by the American Concrete Insti-tute (ACI) ( ACI-318, 2008 ), Canadian Standard Association (CSA) ( CSA, 1994 ), and Construction Institute Research and Information
Association (CIRIA Guide 2) ( CIRIA-Guide2, 1977 ) provide standar-dized methods for calculating the ultimate shear strength of RC deep beams. However, calculated values are conservative in light of experimental tests ( Pal and Deswal, 2011 ; Tan et al., 1997 ; Teng et al., 1998 ) due to the large number of in fl uencing parameters and the potentially nonlinear relationships between these parameters and shear strength. The inherent complexity of these relationships
However, it is surprising that MARS has not yet been applied to problems in the fi eld of structural engineering.

Building a MARS model requires users select tuning parameters that include maximum number of basis functions M max , penalty (i.e., smooth parameter) d and maximum interaction between variables I max . These parameters are considered as important features in controlling MARS model complexity and generalization ( Andalib and Atry, 2009 ). Therefore, obtaining an optimal MARS parameter set is crucial to achieving MARS prediction accuracy.
Friedman  X  s prior parameter selection suggestions have large value ranges, with actual selected values dependent on the dataset at hand ( Friedman, 1991 ).

To overcome this drawback of MARS, our paper used the ABC ( Karaboga, 2005 ) algorithm as a search engine to determine optimal MARS parameter values. ABC was introduced by Karaboga in 2005 and is a swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithm inspired by honeybee foraging behavior. Its relatively small num-ber of control parameters makes ABC fl exible and easy to execute for novice users ( Li et al., 2011 ). Various works have demonstrated the comparative superiority of ABC over other algorithms in identifying optimal solutions ( Karaboga and Akay, 2009 ; Li et al., 2010 ). ABC is also a reliable tool when paired with other data mining techniques ( Hong, 2011 ). ABC is thus a potentially suitable search engine for identifying suitable MARS parameters such as
M max , d and I max .

The objective of this research was to develop and test the evolutionary multivariate adaptive regression splines (EMARS).
The authors created EMARS by fusing MARS and ABC in a manner that incorporated the strengths and avoided the weaknesses of each technique. This newly proposed model operates automati-cally without human intervention and accurately estimates the shear strength of RC deep beams under various parameter set-tings. This study then compared the performance of EMARS against three other benchmark data mining techniques, including back-propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and support vector machine (SVM).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the second section reviews related research works; the third introduces the
EMARS model; the fourth describes the data collection process; the fi fth validates the EMARS model and compares simulations results; and the last presents conclusions. 2. Literature review 2.1. Previous works
There is increasing research interest in applying AI techniques to problems related to RC deep beam shear strength. Numerous studies have proposed approaches to modeling the shear strength of RC deep beams and analyzing the in fl uence of input parameters. Goh (1995) fi rst used ANN to predict the ultimate shear strength of RC deep beams with six input parameters. The author stated that ANN could provide predicted values close to test values. Sanad and
Saka (2001) tested ANN  X  s effectiveness in predicting the ultimate shear strength of RC deep beams with output response derived using nine input parameters. The study demonstrated that ANN outperformed several mathematical approaches, including ACI ( ACI-318, 1995 ), Strut-and-Tie ( Siao, 1993 ), and Mau and Hsu method ( Mau and Hsu, 1989 ).

Yang et al. (2007) also studied ANN  X  s ability to predict RC deep beam shear capacity. Ashour et al. (2003) used genetic programming to model RC deep beam shear strength and derived mathematical formulae that indicated the shear-span-to-effective-beam-depth ratio and main-longitudinal-bottom-reinforcement ratio as the most signi fi cant parameters. Pal and Deswal (2011) recently applied  X  X  X  x where  X  q Z 0  X  is the power to which splines are raised and deter-mines the degree of smoothness of the resultant function estimate; q  X  1 is the case used in this study;  X   X  ensuresvaluesarepositive.
Interaction basis functions are produced by multiplying an existing term with a truncated linear function involving a new variable. In this case, both the existing term and newly produced interaction basis function are used to establish the MARS model.
Setting maximum user order may restrict the search for new basis functions. Formulae for the interaction basis function and general MARS function are represented in Eqs. (3 ) and ( 4 ), respectively
B  X  x  X  X   X  Km b y  X  b f M  X  x  X  X  c 0  X   X  where Km is the number of truncated linear functions multiplied in the m th basis function. Km must be not larger than the maximum interaction among variables I max . Thus, the user must specify I max prior to establishing the MARS model. x v  X  m ; j  X  input variable corresponding to the j th truncated linear function in the m th term; t m ; j is the knot value corresponding to variable x ; s m ; j is the selected sign  X  1or 1; b y is the dependent variable predicted by the MARS model; c 0 is a constant; B the m th basis function, which may be a single spline basis function; and c m is the coef fi cient of the m th basis function.
The fi nal MARS model was constructed using a two-stage process comprising forward and backward phases. The forward phase started with the basis function h 0  X  x  X  X  1. Knots were then chosen automatically. Candidate knots were placed at random positions within the range of each predictor variable to de pair of basis functions. At each step, the model adopted the knot and its corresponding pair of basis functions to give the maximum reduction in sum-of-squares residual error. This process of adding basis functions continued until the maximum number of basis functions M max was reached ( Friedman, 1991 ). M max is set by the user as referenced in Friedman (1991 ). The forward phase selec-tion of the basis function leads to a very complex and over-model. Although this model has poor predictive abilities for new data (testing data), it fi ts the training data well.

To improve model predictive power, the authors employed a backward phase to delete the redundant basis functions that made the least contributions. Generalized cross-validation (GCV) was used as the deletion criterion ( Sekulic and Kowalski, 1992 ). GCV is the mean-squared residual error divided by a penalty that is dependent on model complexity and de fi ned as follows:
LOF  X  ^ f
M  X  X  GCV  X  M  X  X  where n is the number of data cases. C  X  M  X  is a complexity penalty that increases with number of basis functions in the model, de fi ned as
C  X  M  X  X  X  M  X  1  X  X  d M  X  6  X  where M is the number of basis functions in Eq. (5) and parameter d is a penalty for each basis function included in the model. d may be also regarded as a smoothing parameter. A small d generates a large model with more basis functions, while a big d creates a small, smooth model with fewer basis functions ( Fernando et al., 2012 ). Friedman (1991 ) provides further suggestions on choosing the value of d and the in fl uence of d on the fi nal model as well as details on the model building process. the behavior of onlooker bees, which select food sources based on probability. Probability value is calculated as p  X  fit i =  X  NF where fit i is the fi tness value of the i th food source.
An onlooker bee chooses a food source depending on the probability value p i associated with that food source. ABC produces an onlooker bee using Eq. (8) . After evaluating the source, greedy selection is applied and the onlooker bee either updates the new position by removing or retaining the old solution. The ABC algorithm updates the best food source position after termination of the onlooker bee phase. A new best food source position will replace the old if the former provides an equal or a better amount of nectar. Otherwise, the old food source position remains valid.
If food source x i (solution x i ) shows no further improvement through a continuous pre-determined number of cycles, then
Eq. (7) is used to replace that food source with a new food source discovered by the scout bee. The optimization process terminates when the user-determined stop criterion is met. The fi nal optimal solution is available to the user once the optimization process terminates. 3. Evolutionary multivariate adaptive regression splines
One may construct a MARS model with various parameter choices, including maximum basis function M max , maximum interaction I max , and penalty parameter d . However, while setting optimal parameters simultaneously is dif fi cult using MARS, such optimization signi fi cantly improves MARS prediction accuracy.
Suggestions for selecting these parameter values are represented because the range of choices is large and proper values may still lie outside suggested ranges. The authors thus propose EMARS as a tool to help users address this challenging task. The EMARS model is illustrated in Fig. 3 . 3.1. Input data
Original data are normalized into a range of  X  0 ; 1  X  to prevent attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges as well as to avoid numerical dif fi culties. Eq. (10) shows the function used to normalize data. Orenstein et al. (1995) showed 10 folds to obtain the smallest acceptable validation-testing-time bias and variance. Data are fi rst divided into 10 cross-fold training and testing sets. Training sets (nine of the 10) are then utilized to determine the best models. Finally, the models are tested against the testing set, with cross-fold training and testing repeated 10 times. Training data are then used to construct the
EMARS model, which is divided into two sets, namely one set (80%) for training and the other for validation x where x i is any data (input or output), x min is the minimum value of the entire dataset, x max is the maximum value of the entire dataset, and x nor i is the normalized value of the data. 3.2. MARS model
In this stage, MARS is deployed to handle the underlying function. A new MARS model is built for each set of ABC-provided parameter values. ABC  X  s greedy selector will compare model quality based on fi tness function evaluation. Kong et al. (1970) , 52 test patterns of normal strength RC from Smith and Vantsiotis (1982) , and 19 test patterns of high strength
RC from Tan et al. (1995) . Experimental RC deep beams were simply supported and subjected to two-point loads acting symme-trically with respect to the centerline of the span and tested to failure. Fig. 4 illustrates a RC deep beam in detail.

Input parameters used to estimate the shear strength of RC deep beams consist of the effective span to effective depth of breadth of beam ratio ( d / b w ), shear span to effective depth of beam ratio ( a / d ), yield strength of horizontal reinforcement ( f strength of vertical web reinforcement ( f yv ), horizontal web reinforcement ratio (  X  h ), longitudinal reinforcement to area of concrete ratio (  X  s ), and vertical web reinforcement ratio ( strength ( V ) is used as the output variable. Historical value settings and output values are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . 5. Simulation results and comparisons 5.1. Evaluation criteria
The present study used R 2 , MAPE and RMSE to compare EMARS performance against other models. R 2 expresses degree of simi-larity between predicted and actual values, with R 2 values close to 1 indicating that predicted and actual values are very similar.
Low MAPE and RMSE values indicate high con fi dence in model-predicted values.

Root mean-squared error ( RMSE ) is used to compute the square error of the prediction compared to actual values as well as the square root of the summation value. The RMSE is thus the average distance of a data point from the fi tted line measured along a vertical line. RMSE is ef fi cient at assessing undesirably large number is 150; population size is 6 D where D is the number of tuning parameters; the range of M max is  X  5 ; 50 ; d belongs to range  X  0 ; 10 ; and I max has a range of  X  1 ; 9 .

As shown in Table 3 , EMARS achieves very good R 2 values (close to 1) for both training and testing data ( R 2 training  X  0
R testing  X  0 : 97), indicating that the model accurately estimates the underlying function of RC deep beam shear strength. The EMARS model yielded very small average RMSE values for training and testing data of 13.1 and 13.47, respectively, with the minor (3.5%) difference between the two indicating good model generalizability.
Average training and testing prediction values for MAPE were 5.67% and 5.89%, respectively, with both values below 10% indicat-ing model robustness. The very small standard deviation values further indicate that EMARS also provides stable estimation performance. Table 3 shows the parameter settings identi fi each fold. Interestingly, the difference among maximum basis function parameter setting values M max is signi fi cant, as indicated by the large range (19  X  40). Furthermore, six of the 10 penalty parameter values d were found outside of the suggested range ( Friedman, 1991 ). Clearly, user experience is not always adequate to identify penalty parameter values. Furthermore, maximum interaction values I max among variables varying from 2 to 5 demon-strate the challenging task for users for determining suitable parameter values simultaneously.

Table 4 illustrates the approximation function for estimating fold 1 and lists the basis functions of the EMARS model with corresponding coef fi cients. As six out of the nine input variables are used to approximate functions, the remaining variables may be ignored without in fl uencing the estimated results. Notably, basis function values remain normalized.

As mentioned earlier, one of the MARS  X  s most important advantages is its ability to verify the importance of input variables.
Table 5 displays the ANOVA decomposition of the proposed models for estimating fold 1. The fi rst column lists the ANOVA function number. The second indicates the importance of the corresponding ANOVA function by listing GCV model scores with all BFs corresponding to that particular ANOVA function removed. 5.3. Result comparison with other AI techniques To demonstrate the comparative performance of the developed
EMARS model, this study compared results with those obtained by three other techniques, namely BPNN, RBFNN, and SVM. BPNN and RBFNN were chosen as they are popular and effective when used to conduct regression analyses in high-dimensional space ( Samarasinghe, 2006 ). The three selected techniques further represent different data mining techniques, each worth investigat-ing with regard to ef fi cacy in estimating RC deep beam shear strength.

The authors set BPNN and RBFNN parameters in accordance with best performance based on a large number of trails as follows:
BPNN  X  hidden layers  X  1, no. of neurons in the hidden layer  X  9, learning rate  X  0.07, and momentum  X  0.01; RBFNN  X  maximum no. of neurons  X  16, no. of neurons added between displays  X  25, and radial basis function spread  X  1. For SVM, the RBF kernel was used and the grid search approach was used to select turning parameters ( Hsu et al., 2003 )
Table 6 and Fig. 5 present comparative results. With regard to determining RMSE ,average RMSE values for training EMARS, BPNN,
RBFNN, and SVM datasets were, respectively, 13.011, 26.467, 13.757, and 29.578. Average RMSE values for testing datasets were 13.473, average ratio (1.00) with the smallest standard deviation (0.08).
This further demonstrates that EMARS generates results that are in closest agreement with observed results. Fig. 6 shows that the ratio points for each EMARS fold lie close to the standard line (line 1).
Although Tang  X  s method yielded a better average ratio and standard deviation than the three mathematical approaches, all were inferior to those of EMARS. 6. Conclusions
Structural design is an iterative, time-consuming process. Early and accurate estimation of RC deep beam shear strength helps reduce both work times and the risk of design process failure. This study fused an ABC algorithm with MARS to create a new model,
EMARS. In EMARS, MARS maps inputs and output to address learning and curve fi tting and ABC handles global optimization.
EMARS determines optimal M max ; I max and d parameters, inte-grates the advantages and eliminates the weaknesses of MARS and
ABC to attain signi fi cantly better estimation performance, and reduces the need for human intervention in the shear strength estimation process.

To assess the relative performance of EMARS in estimating RC deep beam shear strength, this study compared EMARS against three popular data mining techniques, including BPNN, RBFNN, and SVM, and four mathematical approaches. Results demon-strated EMARS  X  superior estimation capability, with the EMARS model providing an experimental-value-to-estimated-value ratio of close to 1 as well as very low standard deviation. Experiment results have convincingly demonstrated EMARS as a reliable and appropriate approach to estimating RC deep beam shear strength.
EMARS should be considered an effective tool for handling shear strength problems because the model allows civil engineers to accurately assess shear strength without running costly, time-consuming con fi rmatory experiments. Further, EMARS allows civil engineers to analyze the impacts of input parameters on RC deep beam shear strength. The mathematical formulae provided by the
EMARS model may be utilized to help civil engineers better assess and handle the in fl uence of key parameters on shear strength.
