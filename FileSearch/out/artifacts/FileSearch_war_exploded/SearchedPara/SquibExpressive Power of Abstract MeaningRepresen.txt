 University of Groningen to FOL provides the means to represent projection and scope phenomena. 1. Introduction 2015).
 of this squib is to find answers to the following questions: 1. Are AMRs any different from traditional meaning representations? 2. Can we provide a model-theoretic semantics for AMRs? 3. Is there a systematic translation to first-order logic? 4. Is universal quantification expressible in AMRs? 5. Does the AMR language need to be extended? of first-order logic (FOL) and the  X  -calculus is assumed. 2. Basic AMRs ignored in the AMR analyses throughout this article). see here are variables ( e , x , y , etc.), events and concepts ( ( X 
Ms Ribble  X ), and roles ( ARG0 , etc.). The slash indicates an instance: are optional, AMRs can also be given in linear format, for example, (x/girl) :ARG1 (y/book)) for a girl read a book .
 given example we can apply role inversion in two ways, as Figure 2 shows. 528 to be able to assign scope.
 AMRs, x for variables, c for constants, P for properties, and R for roles. Definition 1 (Syntax of Basic AMRs) A ::= c | (x/P) | (x/P :R 1 A 1 ...:R n A n )
AMRs), we delay the translation of roles by converting them first into not-yet-translated AMR A via a role R, we get the expression recursive translation function maps an AMR paired with a  X  FOL formula (  X  denotes a  X  -expression for roles):
Definition 2 (Semantics of Basic AMRs) c,  X  =  X  (c) (x/P),  X  =  X  x(P(x)  X   X  (x)) (x/P :R 1 A 1 ... :R n A n ),  X  =  X  x(P(x)  X  A 1 ,  X  y.R 1 out-going roles, so we need to give it a  X  X ummy X  formula: Figure 3 shows an example derivation.

Definition 4 (Semantics of AMRs with Polarity) c,  X  =  X  (c) (x/P),  X  =  X  x(P(x)  X   X  (x)) (x/P :R i A i ),  X  =  X  x(P(x)  X  A i ,  X  y.R i (x,y)  X   X  (x)) (x/P :R i A i :polarity X ),  X  =  X  X  x(P(x)  X  A i ,  X  y.R i (x,y)  X  e(shout-01(e)  X  X  X  x(teacher(x)  X   X  y.ARG0(e,y)(x))  X   X  u.

Two examples are shown in Figure 5. to linguistic phenomena that require scope.
 P belongs to the class of projection phenomena.

 then be extended with clauses like (x / P:quant  X  ),  X   X  = by changing the order of applications in Clauses 4 and 5 of Definition 8. 6. Conclusion in meaning.
