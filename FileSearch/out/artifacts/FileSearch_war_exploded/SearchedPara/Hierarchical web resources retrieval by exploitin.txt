 1. Introduction
In the last decade, the success of Semantic Web has proved to depend on the spreading of ontologies as a means for com-data access and for modeling complex domains, through common standard languages such as OWL and RDF.
On the other hand, the use of ontologies for describing web resources or, in general information semantically, promises lems of terms polysemy, ambiguity in the meaning, etc.

Ontologies provide an adequate instrument for structuring knowledge in an information domain, supplying controlled vocabularies for the classification of content. Techniques such as thesaurus expansion, query formulation based on the expressive power of an ontology-based knowledge representation is well above the keyword-based search: structured  X  ther inferences related to the domain of interest.
 aimed at knowledge sharing, updating and communication. The construction of a unique, global ontology-based knowledge repository which holds the whole information corpus is a interesting challenge but still far from becoming a reality.
The availability of domain ontologies strictly relies on the methodology exploited to support the process of ontology understanding of the reference domain.

Starting from these considerations, this work presents a formal method to automatically extract an ontology from the and exploits the fuzzy extension of Formal Concept Analysis (briefly, FCA), as a mathematical model to automatically build an ontology. The navigation of the ontology is accomplished by a friendly interface, which allows the browsing size the role of the ontology as a formal and reusable model for the knowledge representation, which supports advanced and the classification of the analyzed resources which maintains completely separated the rough data and semantic information.
 the paper. 2. Related works In the era of Semantic Web, ontologies have acquired a strategic value in many fields such as knowledge management, Information Retrieval, natural language processing and information integration.

Ontologies play an important role in supporting automated processes to access information and are at the core of new strategies for the development of knowledge-based systems. Conventional knowledge acquisition approaches are mainly based on the acquisition of knowledge from documents and are human-driven, labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks.
In order to solve these problems, many automatic and semi-automatic methods have been designed which using text mining and machine learning techniques, allow the ontology generation. Particularly, many tools have been designed for edge from textual resources and the automatic ontology building, whereas in Chau (2007) , an ontology-based knowledge system is modeled to assist engineering activities for sharing and maintaining knowledge. tasks, meanwhile human intervention is just aimed at selecting the input knowledge resources and tuning the parameters. the identification of the ontology goals and the needs for the domain knowledge acquisition.
Some approaches instead, exploit techniques based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) theory for knowledge structuring and ontology building: in Cho and Richards (2007) a method has been adapted to maintain a concept map for the reuse of engine capabilities in the query/answering activities.

Although the ontologies widely contribute to design the domain knowledge modeling, sometimes their expressiveness is ceptual information. Quite a few approaches integrate Formal Concept Analysis and Fuzzy Logic theory for ontology-based approaches ( De the traditional one.

In Tho, Hui, Fong, and Cao (2006) , a framework named FOGA achieves the automatic generation of a fuzzy ontology from from the conceptualization of the extracted knowledge.
 the notion of concept ( Dubois &amp; Prade, 2009 ).

In literature, many other approaches deal with similar problems. Just for giving some examples, in Dattolo and Luccio our approach, it provides an automatic knowledge structuring and visualization which helps the user to create semantic interconnection among web resources, yielding personalized concept maps. In Suksomboon, Herin, and Sala (2006) in turn, knowledge-based, hierarchical dependences among concepts, emphasizing the taxonomic nature of the structure. Besides, 3.

 of vector-based representations of each analyzed resource. Then, through the Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis theory, the describe the phases depicted in Fig. 1 . 4. Frequent term measures map the real domain (resources from Web) into a fuzzy formal context, for the modeling through Formal Concept Analysis (additional details will be given in the following sections).

The mathematical modeling of the fuzzy formal context needs the keywords which are representative of the textual con-between the extracted keywords and resources in the domain application.

After a preprocessing phase, all the text has been normalized, POS-tagged and stemmed. We have exploited he well end, the system uses WordNet Lemmatizer 2 code (WordNet database is used to lookup lemmas) to reduce inflectional forms and derivative related forms of words extracted to a common base form.

Then, we have exploited the known technique TF-IDF ( Ramos, 2003 ), to extract the set of most recurrent keywords keywords which will contribute to built the matrix for the mathematical modeling of the formal context.
Net synonyms according to the sense associated to the words. The evaluation of the synonyms helps us to extract further is computed constructing the set of the synonym dictionary , D

Then, fixed the set D h , let us select the maximum value tf where ^ i is the index of terms w i corresponding to maximum value tf

In particular, this sum represents the relevance of the dictionary D
Then, given all m dictionaries, let us select the maximum value t nary D h of the word w h for the resource j , is:
At this point, for each web resource j , the associated vector is compound of all the weight wtf dictionary D h for all the words in the set W. 5. Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis: theoretical background interpreted from the concept lattice ( Birkhoff, 1993 ) using FCA.

This corresponds to the notion of  X  X  X nheritance X  X . In fact, the lattice can also support multiple inheritance. 5.2. Fuzzy extension of FCA
Recently, FCA has been exploited in many applications in which uncertain and vague information occur in the rep-resentation of the domain. Pioneer studies to exploit the fuzziness into FCA were a generalized Wille X  X  model ( Burusco valued with real values in [0, 1]. Thus the entries of a table describing objects and attributes become degrees from L I is a fuzzy set on domain G M . Each pair ( g , m ) e I has a membership value l The set I = u ( G M ) = {(( g , m ), l I ( g , m ))| " g e G , m e M , l value) associated to each pair (object, attribute).
 as U ( g )={( m 1 , l I ( m 1 )), ( m 2 , l I ( m 2 )), ... ,( m membership associated to attribute m i . U ( g ) is called the fuzzy representation of g. of Fuzzy Formal Concept is given as follows.
 A  X  ={ m e M | " g e A : l I ( g , m ) P T } for A # G and B  X  ={ g e G | " m e B : l " g e A }, B # M , A  X  = B and B  X  = A . Each object g has a membership l for every g . A and B are the extent and intent of the formal concept ( u ( A ), B ) respectively. butes with membership values less than 0.6 are not shown).

B ) is the super-concept of ( u ( A 1 ), B 1 ).

For instance, let us observe in Fig. 2 b, the concept c 5 c and c 3 are super-concepts of the concept c 5 .
 concepts of K with the partial order 6 with the confidence threshold T .

The FCA theory proposes a hierarchical model, where the concepts (objects and their attributes) are arranged in a sub-sumption relations (known as  X  X  X yponym X  X ypernym X  X  or  X  X  X s X  X  X  X  relationship too).

The fuzzy formal lattice evidences the membership associated to the objects and the class-subclass relationship. More formally:

As an example, the Fuzzy Formal Concept Similarity computed between the concept c study)}, and the concept c 5 = {(URL_2, URL_5), (science, study, series)}, shown in Fig. 2 b, is given as follows: about the strength of such relation.

The concept lattice represents a mathematical modeling of knowledge, which is more informative than traditional tree-mation about the knowledge structuring and relationship, such as the fuzziness enclosed in each object/resource and the similarities between fuzzy formal concepts. 6. Ontology building
Our approach aims at building an OWL ontology including information from the fuzzy lattice. A sequence of mapping steps transforms the fuzzy formal context using the fuzzy lattice, into an ontology. mapped as an ontological class that represents the dictionary of its synonyms.

The mapping process enables us to extract the knowledge embedded in the resources collection, producing the ontology l generated OWL ontology.
 mally in the following definitions.
 attributes of the intent B # M describe the properties relative to the class concept C .
Thus, if C 1 and C 2 be the classes obtained by the mapping of two fuzzy formal concepts K of the fuzzy formal context ( G , M , I ), respectively. Let K the subsumption relation K 1 6 K 2 produces a correspondent subclass relation, i.e., C the Superconcept of K 1 , then C 2 is a superclass of C 1
The building of the ontology is based on the object-attribute relationships of the formal context. In our approach, the objects of the fuzzy formal context are web resources and attributes are keywords extracted by parsing the content of these resources. According to Definition 9, the translation of a fuzzy concept is described by the following mapping steps, sketched in Fig. 3 . The mapping of a fuzzy concept in Definition 9 requires the characterization of the class and its properties, and then the specification of the related population. Specifically, four steps have been defined as follows:  X  Dictionary mapping : Each attribute (i.e., keywords/words/terms) from a formal fuzzy context is mapped onto a Synonym
Dictionary that represents the set of its synonyms. In other words, for each attribute (i.e., study ) we have defined an ontological class that represents the dictionary of synonyms (i.e., StudyDictionary ). More precisely, we define an abstract class called Dictionary (that is, the root concept of synonyms dictionaries). Its specialization represents an effective class composed of a set of synonyms associated to a specific term. For instance, Fig. 3 shows the OWL code besides the term itself  X  X  X tudy X  X . Actually, there are no relations among the built dictionaries. the fuzzy lattice:
Our approach automatically produces a class name, identified by a specific progressive number. In Fig. 3 , the OWL code describes Concept_2 (evidenced in the lattice too) which has some value from the classes SeriesDictionary and StudyDic-follo wing sections. ticularly, the OWL code describing the individual URL_2 is shown in Fig. 3 . 7. Applications of the ontology
The outcome of our approach achieves a fair arrangement of web resources through the extraction of the ontology and as follows, 7.1. Classification

The system could define and then formalize an owl: Class, through the query specified by the user and, then, by contain the following terms with the relative constraints:  X  Study or Math  X  Equation  X  Differential
Then, the system should be able to define an owl:Class as follows: retrieve those documents, with respect to the given class definition. 7.3.

We propose an automatic labeling of the ontology. Each class is labeled by considering the meaning of the associated ing to it.

 At this point, let us evaluate the retrieval effectiveness on our generated ontology. cision and recall.
 In this case, the user explicitly submits a query to the system. More formally, let us define:
D  X f d 1 ; d 2 ; ... ; d n g the whole set of dictionaries defined for each attribute (terms and keywords) A  X f a given fuzzy formal context.
 I ={ i 1 , i 2 , ... , i t } the whole set of individuals (resources) of a given OWL ontology.
C i =( D i , I i ) i th ontology class (where I i I represents the individuals and D attributes of C i ).
 Q i ={ q 1 , q 2 , ... , q m } a query, i.e. a set of attributes (i.e., terms) to search in the lattice.
Thus, given an ontological class C i we define a local precision P where
A j is a set of all the attributes in the dictionaries associated to the attributes of C
P i can be seen as a measure of exactness or fidelity of ontological class C relevant attributes of dictionaries in C i and all the attributes of associated to C
R i represents a measure of completeness of ontological class C tionaries in C i divided by the total number of query terms.
 The F -measure value F i relative to the class C i is computed as follows:
Final result of this computation is the list of the F -measure values F ={ F ontology, given a query.

Now, for each individual of ontology, i k e I we calculated its own score as follows: where l j ( i k ) represents the membership of resource i value represents how this resource (i.e., individual) is relevant with respect to the given query.
Next step is the evaluation of the retrieval performance on the whole ontology hierarchy. Given the owl ontology O ,we select all the individuals in the ontology whose score is greater than the given confidence threshold a : let I Then, these resources belonging to I a  X  O  X  are ranked with respect to their scores . through micro-average of the individual precision-recall curves ( Van Rijsbergen, 1979 ).

So, with different ontology hierarchy associated to different ir values, we have observed that the systems performance of the generated ontology by varying ir levels of the generated knowledge structure. when the recall grows. The prevalence of this curve emphasizes that the best performances are obtained considering a median ir value, i.e. exploiting a right trade-off between the horizontal and vertical structures. 10.
