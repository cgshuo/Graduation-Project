We describe a process that monitors newsfeeds for topics that receive unexpectedly high amounts of coverage on a given day. 
An experiment using companies as topics demonstrates this process and shows that a high level of interestingness can be achieved. This work may support a news alert service. KEYWORDS 
Time-series analysis, text data, controlled vocabulary indexing. 
The LEXIS-NEXIS archives contain a great deal of information, most of which is represented as text. Customers generally retrieve information from the archives using Boolean queries and other text-based retrieval tools. We add several thousand documents to the archives daily. As part of our document preparation process we reformat and annotate documents in order to support improved information retrieval. We are beginning to explore how data mining techniques may be used to exploit current annotations, and how such techniques may guide future changes to our document preparation process. 
Some systems in our document preparation process amrotate news documents with controlled vocabulary terms. A controlled vocabulary term is a consistently specified topic indicator that users can incorporate into their queries in order to find and retrieve documents about the corresponding topic. Our set of controlled vocabulary terms represents 60,000 topics. General news subjects and individual companies, people, organizations and places are among the topics in this set. We have added controlled vocabulary terms across a large volume of archived news documents, and continue to add them to incoming documents daily. Historical indexing results are now available for millions of news documents. 
One candidate use of this data is to support a daily news alerting service that notifies customers when topics of interest are in the news. We can of course notify customers when one of our topics simply appears in the news. The assignment of a controlled vocabulary term to just one document meets that threshold. More 402 
When selecting publications to monitor, we must consider their value as sources of hot topics. Wire services and newspapers are the strongest candidate sources because the publication date is usually close to the event date. Magazines, because of their publication cycle, may contribute to an ongoing discussion of a hot topic, but their role more often is to provide analysis rather than breaking news. In those cases where a magazine does break a story, ongoing coverage in wire services and newspapers appears immediately, sometimes before the magazine is published. A process that monitors news for hot topics thus should target wire service and newspaper sources. 
Because we are using newsfeeds, we are attempting to identify hot topics in text data. Problems associated with applying data mining techniques to text have been described elsewhere [9]. 
Data mining processes generally expect structured input, whereas text is unstructured, so data preparation for text data mining requires that we impose structure on the text. This could range from annotating texts with attributes such as controlled vocabulary terms [l] to performing deep linguistic analysis [S]. 
For our purposes, this task is especially costly because of the volume of data in the LEXIS-NEXIS archives (over one billion documents from more than 20,000 sources). We add as many as 100,000 documents daily to our NEWS library. To process and annotate a subset of our NEWS library retrospectively can take months. Any system we introduce to annotate texts in support of data mining must operate within our document preparation environment. Systems must be fast, accurate and fully automated. 
Before we can determine whether some company is a hot topic on a given day, we must first identify whether each document in the targeted sources provides substantial information about the company. We rely on a proprietary system called NEXISE 
Indexing to accomplish this. NEXIS@ Indexing is a controlled vocabulary indexing system that we apply across most English language news sources in the LEXIS-NEXIS archives [8]. 
NEXlSB Indexing uses a knowledge base that contains machine-useable definitions for our 60,000 topics, including definitions for 30,000 companies. Each company is defined by a set of terms that are applied to documents in a large-scale lookup. Term frequency, weight and location are used to determine whether the document is about the corresponding company, and to calculate a relevance score. Scores are normalized on a O-99 scale, where a relevance score of 90 or more indicates that the document contains a major reference to the corresponding topic, that is, when that document is substantially about that topic. A document may also contain minor references to some topics. If the score is at least 50, a controlled vocabulary term that represents the topic is added to a searchable field in the document along with its score. Online customers can use the controlled vocabulary term and relevance scores in their Boolean queries. For this experiment, only documents with major references to companies were used. Searches that use NEXISE Indexing-assigned controlled vocabulary terms to retrieve documents that contain major references average about 95% precision and 90% recall. Using a system that distinguishes between major references and other references automatically is an important part of our data preparation process for data mining. Counting the number of documents in which a company is mentioned can be accomplished easily through our existing Boolean search engine or other means, but such approaches do not reliably distinguish between major and minor references. For example, Microsoft Corp. is frequently mentioned in the news. In some articles, Microsoft is the primary focus. In other articles, Microsoft is mentioned in passing, often to note that it is a partner with or competitor of the company that is the major focus of the article, or to note Microsoft X  X  trademarks. There can be an increase in the number of documents that mention Microsoft because either Microsoft did something newsworthy or because some other company did something newsworthy and simply mentioned Microsoft in its press release. Only in those cases where it was Microsoft that did something newsworthy should the company be a candidate hot topic. NEXISE Indexing adds controlled vocabulary terms and corresponding relevance scores to searchable tields in documents. The controlled vocabulary terms and other document attributes, including source and date information, are also captured as document metadata in an indexing metadata database. This database retains the metadata over time, and provides a usage history for each controlled vocabulary term that NEXlS@ Indexing assigns. Our hot topics identification process is based on manufacturing quality control processes. Rather than inspecting batches of widgets for defectives, we are inspecting batches of documents for relevance. In a news  X  X rocess X  a specific topic will tend to get consistent levels of news coverage (similar to the defect rate in manufacturing) until some important event (the assignable cause) affects the process. Methods to monitor for this exist [4,6]. Each day, we have a variable sample size: the number of documents processed. Most topics are rare, appearing less than once a day. Many companies in fact are not mentioned in the news for weeks at a time, although some well-known companies can appear in the news several times a day. Information from the daily sample is compared to information from the historical sample. A historical sample of 7-10 days is acceptable as company-related news coverage rises and falls quickly. To determine whether a given topic is hot on a given day, its ratio of indexed documents to all documents for that day (ptoduy) is compared to an Upper Control Limit (UCL) based on its historical ratio of indexed documents to all documents for several immediately preceding days (whist): 
The UCL is equal to the historical ratio for the topic plus three standard deviations of that ratio. The number of standard deviations can be increased or decreased to reduce or increase the number of hot topics identified. 
If ptoduy for some topic is greater than the UCL for that topic, the topic is a candidate hot topic. Each candidate hot topic must pass two more tests. First, we verify that d is greater than or equal to some document count threshold, typically at least 3-5 documents. Many topics are mentioned in the news so rarely that this threshold prevents the presence of only one or two relevant documents from being considered hot. Second, we verify that the d documents were found in at least some minimum number of sources, typically 2-3 different publications. This helps us avoid false positive problems that can result when duplicate documents appear in a single source (a common occurrence in newswire source newsfeeds). A candidate hot topic is determined to be a hot topic only if it also passes these two additional tests. 
We use an indexing system and comparisons to historical information to suggest that a news topic is hot. Whether a topic truly is a hot topic, however, is in the eye of the customer. An evaluation task was conducted to measure how well this approach flagged interesting topics. 
Lists of hot companies and company pairs were generated over an eight-week period and turned over to an evaluation team of five expert NEXIS@ searchers. For each identified hot company or company pair, an evaluator searched online for articles that mentioned the company or companies on the corresponding date. 
The evaluator read the retrieved articles and determined whether there was  X  X mportant X  news about the company or company pair. 
The definition of  X  X mportant X  was left undefined, the evaluators had to determine for themselves what was important news. 
In this test, 1,137 companies and company pairs were identified as hot topics. Of these, evaluators determined that 1,094 (96.2%) of the identified hot topics did in fact correspond to important information in NEXISB that day. Another five (0.4%) were judged as  X  X aybe X , and 38 (3.3%) were judged as not important. 
Hot topic identification errors resulted primarily from mistakes that the NEXIS@ Indexing system made or because some evaluators did not regard as important some of the company-related topics that NEXISB Indexing specifically targets. 
We have presented a process for identifying hot topics in a newsfeed. This process relies on a document preparation step that determines which documents contain important information about targeted topics, and a monitoring step that determines when a given topic receives an unusually high amount of coverage in the news on a given day. Evaluation results suggest that this process can successfully support a news alert service. 
The results also suggest that further experiments in this area are warranted. For example, in addition to companies we index for people, organizations, places and news subjects. We should verify that the approach works on these other domains and on combinations of index terms from multiple domains. The FACT system [3] and other related work made use of keyword hierarchies and world knowledge. We have a term hierarchy and world knowledge about our topics that includes corresponding industry codes, SIC product codes, financial data and corporate headquarters location information. We have not begun to exploit such information in our research. We also have relevance scores available on our indexed documents. Our work to date has only used indexing results with relevance scores of 90 or above. 
Perhaps a lower threshold may be acceptable for determining hot topics. We may also fmd that unusual increases in the number of passing references to some company may in fact indicate that the corresponding industry is a hot topic that day. We hope to use further research in this area to suggest improvements to our metadata storage and analysis process and to our controlled vocabulary indexing system. These in turn may lead to more sophisticated research into applying knowledge discovery techniques to the LEXIS-NEXIS archives. We want to thank colleagues David Schmeer, Afsar Parhizgar, 
Paul Zhang and Joe Zhou for their support and suggestions.
