 The op eration and main tenance of to da y's aircraft is a com-plex task. It requires use of some state-of-the-art data min-ing facilites that are not curren tly a v ailable. This pap er is ab out dev elopmen t and use of data mining tec hniques to detect abnormal situations in aircraft op eration. Using his-torical sensor data, that is normally generated during the op eration of aircraft, w e induce mo dels to predict ab onor-mal situations in aircraft engines. The metho d in v olv es cre-ating new features from ra w data and iden tifying trends in particular parameters of in terest. W e describ e ho w mo dels generated from individual aircraft with abnormal situations can b e com bined to generate a single mo del. W eev aluate our approac h using o v er 5 y ears of historical data from the op eration of engines of 34 Airbus A-320's.
 H.2.8 [ Information Systems ]: Database Managemen ts, Database Applications, Data Mining; J.7 [ Computer Ap-plications ]: Computers in Other Systems, Industrial Con-trol T rend monitoring, Data partitioning, Mac hine learning T oda y's commercial aircraft are quite sophisticated and equi-pp ed with man y sensors and on-b oard computers. Their op eration and main tenance therefore in v olv es dealing with an enormous amoun t of data that needs to b e analyzed b y an um b er of departmen ts throughout the airline compan y . These departmen ts ha v e to b e able to analyze data that is in the form of: (i) text generated b y sta (suc h as observ ations related to the conditions of the aircraft and related actions), (ii) n umerous t yp es of automatically generated messages ex-plaining situations suc h as deviation of aircraft parameters, and (iii) parametric data acquired through h undreds of sen-sors and on-b oard computers (whic h are mostly n umeric with some b eing sym b olic).
 One of the main issues in the aerospace industry is that air-craft are getting more and more sophisticated as a result of whic hh uge amoun ts of data are generated without ev en half of this data b eing prop erly analyzed [1, 5]. A large p ortion of this data is ev en destro y ed after a short time. Although v endors of aerospace equipmen t pro vide soft w are to use some of the ab o v e men tioned data (esp ecially para-metric data), m uc h more needs to b e done to in telligen tly detect abnormal situations in the op eration of an aircraft. This is sp ecially true when airline engineers and tec hnical sta ha v e to manage the op eration of a large eet of aircraft (sometimes more than 100).
 Lik e man y other industries, in aerospace prop er use of para-metric data for equipmen t monitoring and in-depth data analysis is rarely p erformed. This is due to the follo wing reasons: (i) all the data ma y not be in tegrated in to one database managemen t system, (ii) engineers and op erators do not ha v e su X cien t time to analyze h uge amoun ts of data, unless there is an urgen t requiremen t, suc h as equipmen t breakdo wn, (iii) complexit y of the data analysis pro cess is in most cases b ey ond the ordinary to ols that they ha v e ac-cess to, (iv) there is no w ell de ned automated mec hanism to extract, pre-pro cess and analyze the data, and summarize the results so that the engineers and tec hnicians can use it, and (v) ev en when there is a data analysis to ol a v ailable, it ma y b e to o sp eci c for the op eration of certain equipmen t. The most imp ortan t ob jectiv e in the op eration and main-tenance of to da y's aerospace industry is that all systems (e.g. auxiliary p o w er units, main engines) for whic h data is a v ailable, can b e con tin uously monitored. The monitoring is p erformed so that the sp ecialists are informed of condi-tions: (i) where there is deviation in the range of an y p er-formance or condition parameters comparing to an exp ected lev el (e.g. fuel consumption is an example of a p erformance parameter and engine vibration is an example of a condition parameter), (ii) when there is an abnormal b eha vior in the op eration of a system (suc has an up w ard or ado wn w ard trend in certain p erformance parameters) that ma y cause p erformance deterioration of one or more systems. The en-gineers and eet sp ecialists will b ene t b ypa ying atten tion only to the aircraft that are op erating abnormally . They can then in v estigate the alerts, prev en t p ossible damages to an y system or comp onen t, rectify the problem and if p ossi-ble, nd out the reason for trends that are presen ted in the form of alerts. In this pap er, w ein tro duce an approac h for recognizing the aircraft or engines that b eha v e abnormally . Abnormal b eha vior ma y sometimes be related to sp eci c aircraft comp onen ts. W e address this problem in a related w ork in whic hw e explain ho w mac hine learning can b e used to build mo dels that predict problems with aircraft com-p onen ts b efore they b ecome non op erational [4]. The t w o approac hes pro vide complemen tary solutions to supp ort en-gineers and aircraft eet sp ecialists in the main tenance of commercial aircraft.
 This pap er presen ts the application of a data mining strat-egy to generate mo dels for abnormal b eha vior detection in the aerospace domain. This domain, lik e man y other do-mains, generates v ery complex data from the p ersp ectiv eof using data mining tec hniques. This complexit y means that instead of directly running a data mining algorithm, the data requires a more elab orated solution. In our problem, there is little c hance to apply a single algorithm to the data and ob-tain appropriate results. In other w ords, w e need to plan a data mining strategy; a sequence of data mining tec hniques and algorithms, as w ell as some prepro cessing and p ostpro-cessing op erations to deal with the complexit y of this data. In our researc h, w e encoun tered the follo wing issues that represen t problems w e faced. These issues are:
 X  Data selection : Retriving the appropriate data from
 X  Lab eling metho d : Splitting the data instances in to
 X  F eature generation : Adding new attributes to the  X  Mo del fusion : Com bining mo dels from di eren t data. The structure of the pap er is as follo ws. In Section 2 w e brie y explain the related w ork and discuss other approac hes to similar problems. In Section 3 w e giv ean o v erview of our approac h to the problem and in Section 4 w e explain the mo del induction phase. Section 5 consists of mo del com bina-tion phase and in Section 6 w e describ e our mo del ev aluation pro cess. In Section 7 w e sho w the results of our exp erimen-tation using real w orld data from this domain and Section 8 has conclusion and future w ork. There is only a limited n um b er of researc h pap ers that are relev an t to this researc h. Guralnik and Srivsta v a [2] fo cus on extracting in teresting patterns from time-series data. Their researc h is ab out iden tifying time p oin ts at whic h the b e-ha vior of a system c hanges, whic h in the statistics literature is called c hange-p oin t detection. They prop ose an iterativ e algorithm that ts a mo del to a time segmen t (windo w) and uses a lik eliho o d criterion to determine if the segmen t should b e partitioned further.
 Han, Gong and Yin [4] emphasize on the imp ortance of mining through segmen t-wise or p oin t-wise p erio dicit y in time-related data. They prop ose an approac htoin tegrate data cub e and a-priori data mining tec hniques for mining segmen t-wise p erio dicit y in time-series data. They concluded that data cub e w as an e X cien t structure for in teractiv e min-ing of m ultiple lev el p erio dicit y .
 Other related w orks are b y Mannila and T oiv onen [6], P ad-manabham and T uzhilin [7], and Guralnik, Wijesek era and Sriv asta v a [3] in whic h they ha v e dev elop ed languages for sp ecifying temp oral patterns. They also prop ose algorithms that tak e adv an tage of the sp eci ed patterns to increase the computational e X ciency of the mining pro cess. While the ab o v e listed w orks are examples of the theoretical researc h e orts, there are also a n um b er of pro jects that are directly aiming at the application itself [8, 10]. W e brie y explained the op eration of mo dern aircraft that are equipp ed with h undreds of sensors to monitor di eren t op eration during igh t. These aircraft generate a lot of data that is stored in a database. A ttac hed to this data is ad-ditinal information pro vided b y aircraft and ground tec hni-cians who describ e abnormal situations or problems detected when the plane is in the air and when it is landed at the gate. These rep orts are usually textual descriptions of the problem, as w ell as brief information ab out when and where it happ ens. There are t w o kinds of these rep orts: (i) the aircraft main tenance pro cess records all the comp onen ts re-paired or replaced iden tifying the exact comp onen t or piece remo v ed or repaired b ecause it w as not w orking prop erly , (ii) rep orts that describ e abnormal situations detected b y other tec hnicians (not main tenance engineers) with no sp e-ci c information ab out the exact system that is op erating abnormaly .
 Appropriate mo dels induced to predict the situations de-scrib ed b y these t w o kinds of rep orts ha v etobedev elop ed in di eren tw a ys: r Repair rep orts pro vide details on ho w a sp eci c sys-r Abnormal situations describ e the problems in terms of The pro cedure presen ted in this pap er divides the problem of generating mo dels for the prediction of these abnormal situations in to: (i) mo del induction and (ii) mo del fusion phases.
 During the mo del induction phase, the data is selected (issue  X  ) and prepared (issues  X  .  X  ). A mo del is then generated for eac h of the di eren t abnormal b eha vior rep orts selected. An iterativ e pro cedure is p erfomed to nd the b est mo del for eac h rep ort.
 The second phase deals with the com bination of t w o or more mo dels in to clusters. Eac h cluster con tains mo dels that are related to similar problems. Therefore, all the mo dels can b e describ ed b y a more general mo del generated b y the fusion of all individual submo dels (issue  X  ). This phase is also p erformed iterativ ely . The goal of this phase is to extract prediction mo dels for eac h of the rep orts selected. Eac h of these rep orts de nes a dataset of records from the last op eration of the aircraft b efore the problem date. Eac hof the records is called an instanc e . The instances are de ned b y a set of parameters that are measured b y di eren t aircraft sensors. The mo d-els are induced from the datasets that consist of v alues for these parameters for a n um ber of igh ts b efore the prob-lem w as detected. T oac hiev e this goal three main tasks are p erfomed: (i) Data selection, (ii) Data preparation and (iii) Rule induction and v alidation. Abnormal b eha vior rep orts con tain iden ti cation attributes (e.g. aircraft n um b er and date of rep ort, etc.), as w ell as a textual description of the problem observ ed b y the crew. The rst task is selection of the rep orts con taining a sim-ilar problem description. The selection pro cess uses iden-tifying k eyw ords and phrases to b e matc hed b y the prese-lected rep orts. This pro cess pro vides a reduced set of records compared with the total n um ber of records stored in the database ( v ey ears of aircraft op eration, in our case), but it also con tains rep orts for di eren t problems. All irrelev an t rep orts are ltered out b y a nal review of output generated b y the k eyw ord-matc hing pro cedure.
 Once the rep orts are selected for a particular problem, all the a v ailable sensor data is then retriev ed from the database. This sensor information b elongs to a time windo w of few mon ths b efore the rep ort date, from the same aircraft and comp onen t. Eac h of these datasets is called a c ase . All sup ervised induction algorithms require data to b e clas-si ed as p ositiv e or negativ e instances. This in v olv es parti-tioning the dataset in to 2 equiv alence classes. The descrip-tion of these equiv alence classes using the rest of the param-eters is the target of the rule induction pro cedure. Since w e w an t to get prediction rules, our p ositiv e instances represen t the situations in whic hw ew an ttow arn the op erator ab out a p ossible problem in the near future. The attribute created to classify the instances is called lab el and the pro cess itself lab eling .
 In our exp erimen ts t w o di eren t lab eling metho ds are pro-p osed: (i) time lab eling , whic h lab els the op erations p er-fomed in the last few da ys b efore the problem happ ened as p ositiv e instances, and the other op eration as negativ e instances, and (ii) tr end lab eling whic h tak es in to accoun t information ab out trends of a sp eci c parameter suc h as when an up w ord or do wn w ard trend is presen t just b efore the problem date. Both metho ds are sho wn in gure 1.b. When trend lab eling is applied, a statistical function is de-ned to detect when the parameter increases or decreases. This function gets a sequence of consecutiv e instances called a window and p erforms the follo wing calculation: 1. The windo w is divided in to a small n um b er of parti-2. F or eac h of the partitions ( P i ; 0 &lt;i&lt;N ), the n um-3. Eac h partition is compared with the follo wing parti-4. Finally , this windo w is lab eled as p ositiv e if: F or example, Figure 1.a presen ts the division of the sequence in to 4 partitions with 4 instances p er partition. This example is lab eled (for = 50%) as p ositiv e b ecause: Time Trend The use of either of the lab eling metho ds dep ends on the problem w e are analyzing. F or example, if the problem is a red ligh t alert due to a high v alue of an aircraft p erformance or condition parameter (e.g. high exhaust temp erature), the time lab eling metho d w ould pro vide a description of the situation previous to this alert. Ho w ev er, the trend lab eling w ould w arn ab out the same situation only during the p erio d that the parameter is con tin uously increasing. An additional purp ose of the data preparation task is the generation of new features for eac h of the instances of the dataset. These new features help the induction algorithm to ac hiev e a b etter mo del. These features are n umerical or statistical functions de ned using the original parameter v al-ues from the instances of a windo w. Example of additional features are: statistical mean, standard deviation and an y trend de nition or v ariation detection functions.
 During our exp erimen ts a large n um ber of additional fea-tures w ere prop osed. Ho w ev er, only those with seman tical in terpretation that w ere appropriate for h uman understand-ing w ere used. The reason b eing that mo dels and rules con-taining these features are pro vided to the op erator when the actual eet monitoring pro cess matc hes a w arning condition de ned b y the rules. Ev en if the monitoring system han-dles complex features as conditions of the rules, tec hnicians can hardly understand the meaning of n umerical functions if they do not represen t initial attributes or their deriv ativ es, suc h as incremen ts, decremen ts or v ariations. The last step of the mo del induction phase is generation of the rules b elonging to the mo del and their ev aluation in terms of accurancy and error rate. The C4.5 algorithm [9] w as applied to generate the rules, using lab els generated b y either of the lab eling metho ds and taking original and additional parameters as p ossible rule descriptors. The inducer is trained using 75% of the instances, sa ving the other 25% for testing. The division bet w een training and testing instances w as c hosen randomly . A confusion matrix w as created in the ev aluation pro cess. The con ten ts of the ev aluation matrix pro vided the n um b er of instances classi-ed successfully as w ell as the p ositiv e instances classi ed as negativ e (missing instances) and the negativ e ones clas-si ed as p ositiv e (false alerts). The p ercen tage of missing instances plus the p ercen tage of false alerts is called err or r ate .
 The ev aluation metho d is not as elab orate as cross-v alidation of similar strategies, b ecause the training and testing data are randomly created from the same group of instances. In addition, there ma y be some dep endency bet w een the in-stances used for creating the mo del and the ones used for v alidating it. The imp ortance of this dra wbac k is therefore reduced b ecause this v alidation metho d is only used for the individual mo dels and not for mo dels generated b y the com-bination of di eren t cases. The other v alidation metho d is presen ted in the follo wing sections. A t this p oin t of exp erimen tation, a mo del has b een gen-erated for eac h of the cases. The mo del usually has high accuracy when describing the case. Ho w ev er, it migh t not be appropriate for a di eren t case, ev en though the cases share a similar textual description of the rep ort. There is a balance b et w een the use of di eren t mo dels for ev ery single case and the induction of a global mo del for all the cases. The rst option extracts v ery sp eci c rules and some times only v alid for the case they w ere generated from. The second one, as w eha v e said, migh t induce v ery w eak mo dels with a high error rate from complex real-w orld data. In order to a v oid this problem, once the mo dels ha v e b een generated they are group ed in clusters of similar cases. The criteria to group t w o cases are based on the similarit ybet w een them. The measure of similarit y is made b y calculating the error rate while applying the mo dels extracted from one case to another.
 Where " A ( B ) is the error rate when the mo del induced from case A is applied to the data in case B .
 Using this metric, the clustering algorithm has the follo wing steps:
 X  Compute the distance b et w een ev ery pair of cases, and
 X  Select the minim um v alue of the matrix ( min ) that  X  If min &gt;MAX E RRO R then nish the algorithm.

 X  Else com bine the t w o cases to create a new case and  X  Go bac kto  X  .
 This algorithm has t w ov ariations that dep end on ho w the com bination of the cases is ac hiev ed: r Com bination b y Learning : This option groups the r Com bination b y F usion : This alternativ e metho d The predicate distance metho d used for rule fusion de nes a metric b et w een rules using predicate information. It is then applied to a group of similar rules.
 The rule metric is de ned as: Let r i b e a rule, de ned as the triplet h P i ;V i ;f i The set of all the rules R = f r 1 ;:::r n g is the de ned as a Metric Space with the Distance function d : R R ! + [1 de ned as: This function also satis es: T o matc h condition 13 (left to righ t implication), it is nece-sary to adjust the second case of the form ula to deal with the predicate v alues V i . The form ula should b e: j P i j j P j j De ning h : R R ! R as X With compar e attr : R R ! (0 ; 1] w e compare t w ov alues of a sp eci c attribute that m ust satisfy: When cases are group ed in clusters, the nal accuracy of the mo del from eac h of the clusters is ev aluated. This v alue is calculated taking all the cases from the cluster but one. These cases are then used to build the mo del (b y learning or fusion) and then use the other one for v alidation. The pro cess is then rep eated b y lea ving aside a di eren t one. The error rate of the cluster is then calculated as the mean of the error rate of eac h of the ev aluations.
 In order to con trast the mo del a di eren t group of cases is used to ev aluate the mo del. These cases b elong to he alty comp onen ts with no abnormal b eha vior rep ort for a long p erio d of time. All instances of this dataset are considered negativ e and the mo del extracted from the cluster should not generate false alerts when it is tested on this dataset. Our approac h has b een tested and ev aluated for the pre-diction of abnormal b eha vior conditions in the op eration of aircraft engines of Airbus A-320. Selected cases w ere those related to high EGT (exhaust gas temp erature) problems detected b y the tec hnicians.
 The k eyw ord-driv en searc h and the man ual review of the rep orts pro vided 13 cases of this problem. In addition to these cases, a group of 12 cases w ere selected to represen t healt y engines without an y rep ort en try for sev eral mon ths of op eration. F or b oth case groups sensor information from the last three mon ths b efore the rep ort w as reco v ered from the database. The simplest approac hto w ards construction of a mo del for this problem is: (a) to lab el all the cases (either with time lab eling or trend lab eling metho ds) and (b) to group all the cases together and calculate the mo del with them. This approac h pro vides the results sho wn on tables 2 [A] and 3. The i -th column represen ts the v alidation of the mo del gen-erated using all the cases with the data from case n um ber i . These results sho who w inappropriate this approac hisfor this problem. In most of the problem cases the error rate is around 50% whic h means that classi cation is almost ran-dom. F or the health y engines the error rates in some cases are high. As an alternativ e to the previous approac h, our strategy is to build a mo del for eac h of the cases and then com bine them in a second phase, creating a cluster of similar cases. The induction of the individual mo dels ma y b e done using only the original features pro vided b y the on-b oard sensors and computers. T able 2 [B] and [C] sho w the results when only the original parameters are used.
 Dev elopmen t of these mo dels using new features lik e (mean, standard deviation and other trend functions) pro vides a b etter approac h, but their calculation requires tunning dif-feren t parameters, lik e the n um b er of instances in the win-do w (windo w size), the o v erlap factor that represen ts ho w man y instances share t w o consecutiv e windo ws, etc. F or the calculation of the b est v alues for these factors a di er-en t range of v alues is scanned for eac h of the factors and then the com bination with minim um error rate is selected. Some of these factors are compared on the 2 plots of gure 2 and the error rates for the b est com bination are rep orted on the table 2 [D] and [E]. The accuracy of these mo dels is b y far b etter than the previous ones, this is also due to the stronger dep endency presen t bet w een t w o consecutiv e in-stances from the data set b ecause of the sharing of common instances when new features are calculated (the n um ber of shared instances dep ends on the o v erlaping factor). When individual mo dels are generated, the last step is to com bine the cases that are similar in to clusters. In our ex-p erimen ts w e ha v e compared the results when using b oth lab eling metho ds and using either com bination b y learning (generating new mo dels when t w o cases are com bined) or com bination b y fusion (using heuristics lik e predicate dis-tance for the fusion). The results are giv en in table 1. Tw o main issues are imp ortan t in our w ork. First, the inclu-sion of new features drastically increases the qualit y of the results obtained b y traditional algorithms for these kinds of problems (on T able 2, compare ro ws [B] and [C] with ro ws [D] and [E]). Lab eling strategy is also imp ortan t but it di-rectly dep ends on the seman tic meaning of the extracted mo del and its implications. Prop er lab eling w ould allo w us to predict problems (some da ys b efore they happ en) or it ma y help us to generate alerts for dangerous situations when one of the imp ortan t parameters con tains an imp or-tan t trend.
 Second, when mo dels are com bined, fusion and learning tec hniques ac hiev e results with di eren tc haracteristics. These c haracteristics are not in uenced b y the mec hanisms used to induce individual mo dels. F ollo wing are examples of ho w these c haracteristics are related to the strategies that w e used to build a new mo del: p The com bination of results b y fusion reduces the error p When com bining b y learning, the mo dels co v er more Our approac h sho ws v ery in teresting con tributions related to the applications of data mining tec hniques in aerospace that ma y be applicable to other domains as w ell. There are, ho w ev er, some issues that require further study and researc h. On one hand, the com bination pro cess w as only able to group half of the cases (in the b est exp erimen t), k eeping the rest of the cases apart. De ning larger clusters and getting also a good accuracy factor ma y be ac hiev ed either b y other com bination strategies or induction of di er-en t individual mo dels. Both of these issues require further in v estigation.
 On the other hand, lab eling metho ds are an imp ortan t ele-men t of mo del induction and w orking with di eren t metho ds w ould pro vide di eren t results. The new metho ds should b e b oth useful (in terms of accuracy and supp ort) for the in-duction algorithm and comprehensiv e for the h uman user that handles the rules extracted b y the pro cess.
