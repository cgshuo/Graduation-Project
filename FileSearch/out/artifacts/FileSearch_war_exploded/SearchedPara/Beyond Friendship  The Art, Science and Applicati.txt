 While Recommender Systems are powerful drivers of en-gagement and transactional utility in social networks, People recommenders are a fairly involved and diverse subdomain. Consider that movies are recommended to be watched, news is recommended to be read, people however, are recom-mended for a plethora of reasons  X  such as recommendation of people to befriend, follow, partner, targets for an adver-tisement or service, recruiting, partnering romantically and to join thematic interest groups.

This tutorial aims to first describe the problem domain, touch upon classical approaches like link analysis and col-laborative filtering and then take a rapid deep dive into the unique aspects of this problem space like reciprocity, intent understanding of recommender and the recomendee, contex-tual people recommendations in communication flows and social referrals  X  a paradigm for delivery of recommenda-tions using the social graph. These aspects will be discussed in the context of published original work developed by the authors and their collaborators and in many cases deployed in massive-scale real world applications on professional net-works such as LinkedIn.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  Information filtering Algorithms, Experimentation, Human Factors People Recommenders, Social Networks
Recommending new connections to establish is one of the core practical applications of Recommender Systems in so-cial networks. Recently, Social Network utility however has scale deployments of such systems. The audience can expect t o walk away with a thorough overview of the problem do-main, subtleties and applications of people recommenders. In addition, algorithmic and mathematical formulations of Multi-objective optimization, Reciprocity and Behavioural Intent modelling and Social referrals will be discussed which should provide a compelling preview into building real world applications using these techniques for both enterprise and consumer industrial applications. The pre-requisites for this tutorial is some familiarity with foundational Recommender Systems, Data Mining, Machine Learning and Social Net-work Analysis literature, however, since introductory mate-rial will be covered as well, so the talk should cater to a wide audience at the conference.
Luiz Augusto Pizzato is a research fellow with the Uni-versity of Sydney. He works closely with the Smart Services Cooperative Research Centre on projects related to services on personalisation, mobile personalisation, new media, and multi-channel content delivery. He has a PhD from Mac-quarie University in Sydney, Australia for work related nat-ural language processing and information retrieval. Luiz has done extensive work in the area of reciprocal recommender and have implemented and evaluated a number of recipro-cal recommender algorithms to match people to people for a large online dating website. These algorithms have been successfully trialled in a large scale user experiment and have since then been used to find dating partners.
