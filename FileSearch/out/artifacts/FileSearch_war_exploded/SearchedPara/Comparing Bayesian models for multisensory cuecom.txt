 posed with the problem of identifying the position of a common source, but also of determining independent causes to the auditory and the visual stimulus. to manipulate the degree of belief assigned to there being a common cause within a multisensory range of cue conflicts. asked to count both the number of flashes and the number of beeps [11]. The advantage of the a dual report. Human data were accounted for well by a Bayesian model in which the joint prior distribution over visual and auditory number was approximated from the data. In a similar study, subjects were presented with concurrent flashes and taps and asked to count either the flashes or with a near-diagonal form. The corresponding generative model assumes that the sensory sources somehow interact with one another. A third experiment modulated the rates of flashes and beeps. The data from this experiment were modeled using a joint prior distribution which is the sum of a near-diagonal prior and a flat background.
 not formalize the model selection process that underlies the combination of cues. This makes it ad hoc form [22, 23]. However, we believe that such assumptions are not needed. It was shown have a common cause. In this paper we compare these different models on a large data set of human position estimates in an auditory-visual task.
 is very general. 2.1 Traditional cue integration erated are conditionally independent from each other and follow Gaussian distributions. That is, tions are x V and x A , the probability that their source was s is given by Bayes X  rule, If a subject performs maximum-likelihood estimation, then the estimate will be a single source and thus implicitly have a common cause. The experimentally observed distribution is then normal distribution, with mean  X   X  s  X  = w V s V + w A s A w posterior distribution. 2.2 Models with bisensory stimulus priors to the product of unimodal likelihoods and a two-dimensional prior: predictive power. In [23], it has the form while in [22] the additional assumption  X  = 0 is made 1 .
 In all three models, the response distribu-tion p ( X  s V ,  X  s A | s V ,s A ) is obtained by iden-tifying it with the posterior distribution p ( s V ,s A | x V ,x A ) . This procedure thus implic-itly assumes that marginalizing over the latent variables x V and x A is not necessary, which leads to a significant error for non-Gaussian pri-ors. In this paper we correctly deal with these issues and in all cases marginalize over the la-tent variables. The parametric models used for the coupling between the cues lead to an ele-gant low-dimensional model of cue integration that allows for estimates of single cues that dif-fer from one another. 2.3 Causal inference model In the causal inference model [24, 25], we start from the traditional cue integration model but remove the assumption that two signals are caused by the same source. Instead, the num-ber of sources can be one or two and is itself a variable that needs to be inferred from the cues. If there are two sources, they are assumed to be independent. Thus, we use the graphical model depicted in Fig. 1. We denote the number of sources by C . The probability distribution over C given internal representations x V and x A is given by Bayes X  rule: generating x V and x A given C is obtained by inserting a summation over the sources:  X  p ( x V ,x A | C = 2) = 1 puted p ( C | x V ,x A ) , the posterior distribution over sources is given by where i can be V or A and the posteriors conditioned on C are well-known: p ( s i | x A ,x V ,C = 1) = estimate is the mean of the posterior distribution, for instance for the visual estimation: s simulate an experiment numerically.
 by integrating out the latent variable C, with: of the world, and it thereby also allows to predict judgments of unity. To examine the performance of the causal inference model and to compare it to previous models, we performed a human psychophysics experiment in which we adopted the same dual-report paradigm background presented on a 21-inch CRT monitor. Observers had to report by means of a key press (1-5) the perceived positions of both the visual and the auditory stimulus. Each combination of each condition, visual and auditory response histograms were obtained.
 We obtained response distributions for each the three models described above by numeral simula-to the position closed to the best estimate. The simulated histograms obtained in this way were compared to the measured response frequencies of all subjects by computing the R 2 statistic. The parameters in the causal inference model were optimized using fminsearch in MATLAB to cue combination for large disparities well using such models.

Compared to the best fit of the causal inference model, the Bresciani model has a maximal model has a maximal log likelihood ratio of the data of  X  18  X  6 .

This shows that a mandatory integration model is an insufficient model of multisensory interactions.
 We used the individual subject fittings from above and and averaged the auditory bias val-ues obtained from those fits (i.e. we did not fit the bias data themselves). Fits are shown in Fig. 3 (dashed lines). We applied a paired t-test to the differences between the 5  X  and 20  X  disparity conditions (model-subject com-parison). Using a double-sided test, the null hypothesis that the difference between the bias in the 5  X  and 20  X  conditions is correctly pre-dicted by each model is rejected for the Bres-ciani model ( p &lt; 0 . 002 ) and the Roach model ( p &lt; 0 . 042 ) and accepted for the causal infer-ence model ( p &gt; 0 . 17 ). Alternatively, with a single-sided test, the hypothesis is rejected for the Bresciani model ( p &lt; 0 . 001 ) and the Roach model ( p &lt; 0 . 021 ) and accepted for the causal inference model ( &gt; 0 . 9 ).
 The reason that the Bresciani model fares worst similar to the causal inference model. We have argued that any model of multisensory perception should account not only for situations still influence each other.
 We compared three Bayesian models designed to account for situations of large conflict by apply-Gaussian bisensory priors without mandatory integration, the response distribution can no longer a common cause and which stimuli are unrelated.
 We have seen that multisensory perception is a suitable tool for studying causal inference. How-perceptual phenomena, including perceptual grouping and binding, as well as within-modality cue combination [27, 28]. Causal inference is a universal problem: whenever the brain has multiple pieces of information it must decide if they relate to one another or are independent. coding. Recent work has shown how the optimal cue combination assuming a common cause can inference model will open the door to a complete neural theory of multisensory perception.
