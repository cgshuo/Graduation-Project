 In this paper, we propose a graph-based approach to con-structing a multilingual association dictionary from Wikipedia, in which we exploit two kinds of links in Wikipedia articles to associate multilingual words and concepts together in a graph. The mined association dictionary is applied in cross language information retrieval (CLIR) to verify its quality. We evaluate our approach on four CLIR data sets and the experimental results show that it is possible to mine a good multilingual association dictionary from Wikipedia articles.

A multilingual association dictionary is a kind of dictionary that enables users to extract associated words or phrases in other languages for a specified word, which is of benefit to many multilingual applications such as multilingual text classification, question answer and information retrieval.
We note that Wikipedia, the world X  X  largest multilingual online encyclopedia, is a promising corpus for multilingual association dictionary construction. Every article in Wikipedia is describing a specific concept (described by the title of this article) and always has multilingual versions. Also, it has a dense link structure [1]. In particular, we are inter-ested in two kinds of links in Wikipedia articles. The first one is the monolingual inner link to other concept, which typically indicates a topical association between articles, or rather between concepts being described by corresponding articles. The second one is the multilingual link on the left side of a Wikipedia article, which is used to link a concept to its multilingual versions. In the previous studies [1, 2, 3], Wikipedia has been successfully applied in mining associa-tion dictionary. However, most of the previous studies focus on building a monolingual association dictionary. In this paper, we extend them into the multilingual environment. We propose a graph-based approach to mining multilingual association dictionary from Wikipedia articles. We analyze two kinds of association in Wikipedia articles, association between concepts and association between words and con-cepts, so as to build a weighted undirected graph that links multilingual words together. The relatedness of any pair of words can be estimated from this graph.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed approach. Section 3 presents the experimental results. Conclusions are given in Section 4. The main idea of our approach is based on the observation that related words in different languages are likely to co-occur with the same concepts or highly related concepts. Since the Wikipedia article has rich links of concepts, it is possible for us to associate two words in different languages via these concept links in a graph, in which the concepts and words are regarded as vertices and their relatedness can be represented by edges. Thus, the words in different languages can be associated together via the edges.

The main issues of our proposed approach are: (1) how to construct this graph; (2) how to estimate the weights of the edges; (3) how to compute the relatedness between words in different language from the graph. We will address these three issues as follows. A multilingual association dictionary can be represented as a weighted undirect graph. This can be formalized as follows. The dictionary can be represented as a weighted undirect graph G = &lt; V , E &gt; , where V denotes set of nodes and E denotes set of edges. For the two different kinds of vertices and edges, we use superscripts c and w to distinguish them. For example, v c represents a concept vertex and v w repre-sents a general word vertex. We describe how the graph is built as follows.

First, we use the concept links to construct a weighted undirected graph, in which the vertexes are concepts. There is an edge between a pair of concepts if they co-occur within a certain distance which will be address in section 2.2. Sec-ond, we add all general words as vertexes into the graph; specifically, if a word has co-occurred with a concept within a certain distance, we add an edge between the word and the concept into this graph and the weight is the related-ness between the word and concept. After these two steps, we get the association graph that contains two kinds of ver-texes, word vertex and concept vertex. We call this new the graph, we link words in different languages together. Technically, there are many methods that can be used to not the main concern in this paper, so for these two kinds of to estimate their weights, which is similar to that used in [1]. If a word and a concept or two concepts appear in an ar-ticle within a certain distance, we count a co-occurrence frequency of them. The distance is a sliding window of k sentences and k takes the value of 3 in our experiments.
In our experiments, we use Dice Coefficient formula [4] to compute the co-occurrence between two terms. The formula of dice coefficient is as follows: where f x and f y are the number of times of term x and y occurred respectively, f xy is the number of times that term x and y occur together and Dice ( x, y ) takes the value in the range from 0 to 1. Every path between two words, w 1 and w 2, represents a certain kind of association and intuitively longer path is less reliable as the words are not co-occur directly. So the associ-ation of one path can be estimated by the following formula: where p is a path between two words, wpl ( p ) is the weighted path length of p and len ( p ) is the length of the path p .
Moreover, if we take all the paths into account, the amount of computation will be huge. So we take the maximum value according to Equation 2 as the relatedness of two words and we only consider association of two words linked through one or two concepts. The relatedness between two words, w 1 and w 2, can be computed by the following formula: where n is the number of paths between word w 1 and w 2. It is hard to verify the quality of the multilingual associ-ation dictionary directly as we can not find a multilingual word similarity test collection. However, it X  X  possible to val-idate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a certain kind of multilingual application. In this paper, the multilin-gual association dictionary is used in two ways, conducting query expansion and filtering low probability translation al-ternatives, to enhance structure-based query translation ap-proach [5] in CLIR. We evaluate the proposed approach on TREC-5, TREC-6, NTCIR-5 and NTCIR-6 English-Chinese CLIR data sets. MAP (Mean Average Precision) perfor-mance measurement is used in this paper.

The basic bilingual translation dictionary adopted in our experiments is the LDC EC2.0 dictionary 1 . Wikipedia ar-ticles are used as multilingual corpus for mining the multi-lingual association dictionary and we used the English and Chinese static HTML dumps released in June, 2008. Also, we extract a bilingual dictionary, called WIKIDICT in this paper, from the title of Wikipedia articles with 256,094 Chi-nese entries and 109,120 English entries. All of our CLIR http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/ experiments are conducted based on a dictionary named LDC WIKI (combined LDC and WIKIDICT ).

The following table shows the MAP performance of all 4 runs in our experiments. The first row describes the per-formance of monolingual using BM25 weighting formula. The second row shows the performance of bilingual base run based on structure-based query translation approach [5]. The 3rd row is the performance of using multilingual asso-ciation dictionary to conduct pseudo relevance feedback. In particular, for every word in target language we use the mul-tilingual association dictionary to construct a pseudo docu-ment and the document is represented as a vector, in which every dimension represents a word in the query language. Thus, we can use cosine similarity to rank the documents according to the query. The words corresponding to the top ranked documents (e.g. 15 or 20 documents) are used as expansion terms. The 4th row is obtained via filtering the low probability translation alternatives for the 2nd run. In particular, we first rank the translation alternatives ac-cording to the relatedness with the query obtained from the association dictionary; and then filter unrelated translation alternatives accordingly, but we keep at least two. The val-ues in the parentheses show the performance percentages over the monolingual run, which are used to measure the level of closeness with monolingual retrieval.

From the table, we can see that using multilingual asso-ciation dictionary to conduct filtering or expanding in the CLIR experiments can always bring better retrieval perfor-mance. It means that we can always find real associated words or even the correct translations of out-of-dictionary words and phrases from the mined dictionary.
 In this paper, we propose a graph-based approach to mining multilingual association dictionary from Wikipedia articles. We have designed two ways to evaluate the mined associ-ation dictionary in the field of CLIR. Experimental results have shown that it is possible to mine a good multilingual association dictionary from Wikipedia articles. It should also be noted that our best bilingual retrieval results are not as good as that in other research. In the future, we will investigate how to incorporate our approach into other CLIR models to get better performance.
