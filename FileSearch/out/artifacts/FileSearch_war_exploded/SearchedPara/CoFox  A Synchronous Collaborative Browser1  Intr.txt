 During recent years the Internet has evolved into an increasingly social place, where more and more activities need of the collaboration and views of multiple parties. There are numerous activities which can benefit from the collaboration between users, including: trip planning, document making, researching, shop-ping, etc. However, web searching has re mained largely an individual activity more than a collaborative task.

Most research in collaborative search focuses on implicit collaboration (i.e. users are not explicitly aware of each other). Examples include implicit query suggestion and collaborative filtering. Data extracted from other users X  searching sessions can improve future searches and help current users with similar search patterns and information needs. On the contrary, other collaborative systems have opted for an explicit and synchronous approach[2][6][8].

This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a system for syn-chronous collaborative web searching, named CoFox. CoFox enables awareness of all the actions performed by a remote search partner through the use of a re-mote view window. This window shows a live visualisation of the remote user X  X  browser window, which enables the local user to keep track of the other user X  X  steps and also to evaluate together a web page as if they were co-located, through the built-in communication tools. Whilst this functionality is available in other systems such as Coagmento [11], its effects have not yet been properly studied. It has been considered as an extra feature, and not an opportunity to support awareness in a more natural setting. F urthermore CoFox s upports effective di-vision of labour by letting the users undertake their own individual searches allowing them to put their views together at any time whilst being aware of the remote user X  X  actions.

A user centred experiment was carried out to evaluate the performance achieved by 18 pairs of users using CoFox in three different tasks and settings. The results show that the collaborative search experience and constant awareness of the friend X  X  actions, provided by CoFox, helps users to work more efficiently when compared to the baseline systems when performing a collaborative task. 1.1 Motivation There are many existing systems facilitating collaboration through algorithmic mediation [10]. Alternatively, some systems allow users to manually organise re-sults within different containers [4] wh ich are then shared with a group of users. Although these systems have been proven to help users collabo rate effectively, a common factor to many is the steep learni ng curve of new concepts and working practices in order to maximise collaboration effectiveness. The motivation of this study is to explore other alternatives for collaboration. By adapting and com-bining everyday elements, such as video players, instant messaging clients and a browser history, we wish to faciliate a more natural approach to collaboration, as it is observed in the group information immersion and sharing in physically co-located environments. We propose using video as the main awareness sup-porting mechanism along with a set of tools to allow for a collaborative activity to take place and we evaluate its effectiveness when compared with individual and co-located web searching. Awareness in collaborative browsing refers to the extent that a user is aware of what the other user X  X  thoughts and actions are, so that collaboration can take place. Liechti &amp; Sumi [5] identify four different types of awareness: Group aware-ness; Workspace awareness; Contextual awareness and Peripheral awareness.
The effects of awareness were studied by Villa et al [12] in the context of multimedia retrieval. They concluded that, while a positive trend was observed, awareness did not necessarily lead to better performance.

Collaborative systems, such as SearchTogether [6], focus on the group dynam-ics of collaboration. It does so by keeping a common history of the activity of all users. Each user is provided with tools t o store, sort and access queries or URLs contained in the history provided by any of the group members. SearchTogether also provides a tool called  X  X plit search X , which divides the results of a search amongst the users for them to evaluate. A similar system is Coagmento [11], which additionally allows for the sharing of snippets and comments amongst collaborating users within the same project.

CoSense [9] was intended to help ease the sensemaking process when users are engaging in collaborative information seeking activity. CoSense organises all data related to the collaborative session , such as chat messages, URLs, comments associated with the URL, etc. CoSense uses novel information visualization tech-nique to reduce the complexity of data presented to the collaborating users.
Collaborative systems have been also explored in other contexts such as col-laborative multimedia retrieval [4]. Adcock and Pickens [1] designed a system for collocated, synchronous collaboration between searchers for video search.
Alternative input and output devices have been extensively studied in col-laborative search tools. For example, CoSearch [2] is a system developed for co-located search by exploiting the use of many pointing devices or mobile phones, in order to explore results or to suggest new queries. Other systems such as WeSearch [8] use a table-top multi-touch display to allow a group of co-located users to collaboratively search, share results, discuss and evaluate information.
Whilst some systems allow the view of a remote user X  X  screen, it is not part of the user X  X  search process and it is regarded as a supplemental feature (as in the case of SearchTogether). We believe that a system built around the natural feedback of a video stream taking a primarily visual approach to collaboration will greatly benefit users. Thus we will be supporting mutual awareness through the bidirectional visualization of user screens as a live video stream, building the rest of the system around this visual context. In this section, the collaborative interface is introduced. To support awareness, division of labour and independence, the system includes a series of specialised tools. They have been tailored to resemble standard tools commonly to enhance the user familiarity, diminishing the learning curve. As a result, we expect the users to feel comfortabl e with the look and feel of the GUI when performing collaborative search tasks.

The Local User Area (LUA. See figure 1, dot 1), The right area of the interface comprehends the work area for the local user which contains a full browser featuring the Gecko rendering engine. It allows the user to perform tab-browsing, search for text on a given page, etc. At the bottom of this window there is a progress bar which indicates the loading of web pages.

The Remote User Area (RUA. See figure 1, dot 2), located at the left side of the interface, it comprehends the tools to enable synchronous collaborative searching. These tools included are: the live video feed of the remote user X  X  win-dow, the shared links tool and the instant messaging tool. The tools provided by the system are now introduced paying atte ntion to the core concepts of collabo-rative search awareness, division of labour and independence: The remote user X  X  window located in the RUA represents our strategy to support awareness in our system. The remote user X  X  window shows what the remote user is currently look-ing at all times as a video stream. This allows the users to know at a glance, what the other user is doing in a straightforward and natural way. For example, this is manifested as the users share information just by highlighting snippets within a web page for the remote user to see, providing a natural way to referring to on-screen information, which resembles fing er-pointing on a co-located scenario.
Division of labour is a core concept of collaborative browsing. It refers to the ability of dividing a problem into smaller units so that it can be approached by a number of collaborating users at the same time. Division of labour is supported in CoFox X  X  as follows: In contrast with o ther systems, where two or more users use a single computer [2] with one or multiple pointing devices, CoFox allows each user to interact independently with their own computer, whilst sharing their findings and ideas in real-time in a similar fashion to SearchTogether [6]. The system has been designed to work sp ecifically in pairs because as stated by [3], over 70% of collaborative searches are carried out in pairs. Moreover, users can use the instant messaging tool to communicate, organise, and evaluate results at the same time that they contrast information through the remote user window. Furthermore, the shared links tool included in the RUA allows users to keep a common history of relevant URLs they consider. Independence is an important factor in CoFox, and it strives to make the collaborative interaction as unobtrusive as possible, whilst still keeping an optimal level of awareness. CoFox allows local users to perform their own searches without interfering or being interfered by the remote user by providing a flexible interface. The users are able to hide the tools provided when they are not using them or resizing the different components to occupy as much of the screen as desired. Eighteen pairs of participants were inv ited to take part in the experiment. The experiment comprised three different ta sks performed in three different systems which were organized following a Greco-Latin square layout. The order of the tasks shifted from one session to another in order to reduce the statistical effects which may arise from learning.

The tasks, lasting 20 minutes each, were devised at different levels of collabo-ration and varying objectives, which wo uld affect the search strategies taken by the users.

Travel: In this task, the users are given a budget and they are to find the best deals they can to travel from Tenerife to Scotland and back. This includes flight tickets and accommodation. After they have accomplis hed that, they are to find interesting places that they might want to visit.

Computer shopping: In this task the users are given a budget to buy a computer of their choice for a friend X  X  b irthday. They are given some guidelines as to what their friend might like the most but they are free to make any choices.
Egypt research: In this tasks, the users are given some questions about ancient Egypt to which they will have to find the answers on the internet. This task is mostly exploratory since the users are likely not to be familiar with the domain and questions can be tricky to answer. 4.1 Baseline Systems Two systems (or scenarios) were use as baselines, namely Solo and Together. When working with the Solo baseline system, a pair of users are given the same task to complete it on their own without interaction between them. This baseline system simulates the case in which two people, interested in the same topic, would perform the same search on their respective machines to find relevant information to later discuss about it.

In the case of the Together baseline system, the users are sitting in front of a single machine (co-located). One of the users is interacting with the computer whilst the other is assisting him by suggest ing new queries, helping to evaluate results and so on. This baseline system simulates the most common collaborative situation [3], which may take place in contexts such as, trip planning or group study. 4.2 Subjects The average subject is between 25 and 35 years old, with good knowledge of IT, good web searching skills, which frequently uses instant messaging clients to communicate with his/her friends. Somet imes he/she needs to perform searches along with his friend, in order to fulfil a common information need and he/she feels that current tools do not properly support his collaborative activity, and therefore he/she would have liked a system to assist him.
 4.3 Hypotheses Building upon the expected benefits intro duced in the previous section, the fol-lowing hypotheses have been formulated to evaluate our system: (H1) CoFox helps users to effectively co llaborate when working together to fulfil a common information need; (H2) CoFox helps users to find more relevant information sooner, when com-pared to the proposed baseline systems; and (H3) Users experience higher satisfaction using CoFox for collaborative searching, when compared to the baseline systems. 4.4 Data Collection To evaluate our hypotheses we collected both qualitative and quantitative data during the experiments. Qualitative information was gathered through the use of questionnaires. For the quantitative data, all the interactions with the system were logged, paying special attention to these events:
LocalBrowser UrlLoad Completed: It represents the load of a webpage, as a result from the user clicking on a link. The URLs are stored to be later processed.

LocalBrowser Query Captured: This event represents every query issued to a search engine such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. The text submitted as a queryisstoredasitsvalue.

LocalBrowser folder changeTab: This event stores clicking events of switching between tabs.

ChatSent: It stores the text sent through the instant messaging tool to an-other user.

Finally, a list of relevant URLs was built by using the results submitted by the users in the evaluation. This section presents the results obtained during the experiments described in section 4, which are discussed with res pect to the hypotheses introduced in section 4.3. 5.1 Effective Collaboration To compare the effectiveness across sys tems we can measure the differences with respect to the number relevant pages visited, the overall number of pages visited and the time spent. H1 states that the effectiveness achieved by the users when using CoFox outperforms that of the baseline systems. Table 1 shows a series of summary values per each of the systems averaging over all 18 sessions. By looking at the values of the first column (Rel. Pages), we can see that CoFox outperforms the other systems in terms of total number of relevant pages visited during the search sessions. In the other hand when looking at the total number of pages visited (Tot. Pages), CoFox also leads with over the two baseline systems. Furthermore if we compare the Together baseline against the others it is easy to argue that they are in disadvantage since they only have access to a single machine whereas the other scenarios involve two users in two sepparate machines. In the other hand one could also argue that the time invested by the users performing a task in the Together scenario has yielded lower results in terms of relevant pages and total pages visited, therefore with respect to our metrics the users have wasted more time that in the other cases. In the other hand, when comparing CoFox to the Solo scenario in terms of total and relevant pages, we can appreciate that even though the number to total pages remains very similar, the total number of relevant pages visited is approximately 1.5 times greater than what was achieved in the Solo scenario. This can be attributed to the users being able to organize their search, decreasing the replication of results, and efficiently focusing their efforts to yiel d better results in the same amount of invested time.
 The column  X % X  of table 1 represents the percentage of relevant pages visited. When using CoFox 23.92% of the pages have been assessed as relevant which is superior to both baseline systems. The average ending times of CoFox and Solo are very similar, whereas Together session s are noticeably shorter. The apparent reason for this, based on direct observation of the subjects, is related to the roles that the users play in such a situation. One of the users seems to lead in the search as the other user remains mostly passive, which negatively affects the search as the active user gets bored and rushes to finish the task. When looking at the relevant pages visited per minute (RelPerMin), CoFox takes the lead with practically double the relevant pages per minute compared to the Solo system and slightly more than double compared to the Together system. This reaffirms that users are finding more relevant results per unit of time when using CoFox when compared to the other systems.

Table 2 holds qualitative data gathered from the questionnaries. Users where asked to rate their agreement with the st atement  X  X oFox helps me and my search partner to be more effective X . The rating average was 6.43 with a verly low stan-dard deviation showing a very high level of agreement. Similarly users rated the organizational and synchronization lev els they perceive with their search part-ners, as well as the awareness about their s earch partner X  X  actions and thoughts. The results results were very positive with a mean value of 6.14 and 5.86 respectively.

Finally, the users were asked to rank th e systems by preference order to per-form collaborative tasks. A majority of 64% of the subjects chose CoFox as their first option, followed by the baselines systems Together(25%) and Solo(11%). Furthermore, users were asked about t heir experiences using CoFox, a common argument being that CoFox, allowed them to effectively search on their own ma-chines, whilst still being able to communicate with the other user when needed. Moreover, when performing the task with the Together baseline, they felt that they spent valuable time discussing resulting in a less productive search and exploring less results, compared to CoFox.
 Based on the data presented and the users X  statements we can assert that CoFox can increase the effectiveness of t he search, in terms of effectiveness per-ceived by the user and overall system performance when carrying out collabora-tive searches, compared to the baselines. 5.2 Finding Relevant Information This subsection looks at how the users find the relevant information that they are seeking. H2 states that users find more relevant information at a earlier stage when using CoFox when compared to the bas elines. To evaluate this hyphoteses we divide the data in proportional chunks of data with respect to time. Figure 2(a) shows the frequency of url loads per time range. In this figure it can be observed that the differences between Co Fox and Solo systems with respect to the quantity of web pages visited is not very significant. This is not the case when we observe the values for the Together baseline system, which yields substantially lower page loads. The reasoning behind is the limitation of this collaborative setting of having only one terminal at the users disposal. Therefore it is intuitive that given any time range, this system scen ario would result in significantly less visited pages, whilst the other two systems remain similar with respect to this metric.

Moreover figure 2(b) shows the number of relevant web pages visited in equiv-alent time ranges. To build this figure w e crossreferenced the list mentioned in section 4.4 containing the urls of relev ant web pages with all the visited pages for each of the systems. We can observe that the differences become more acute as the time passes. CoFox outperforms the other systems following a bell shaped distribution which falls down after 7.5 minutes as the users compile their answers in the emails. The distributions for Together and Solo baselines are behave sim-ilarly. It is imporant to note that even though more queries are issued during the Solo scenario than Together, the performance achieved is very similar. 5.3 User Satisfaction Figure 3(b) shows the frequencies of queries issued, divided in ranges of time of 2 minutes and a half. We can observe that the number of queries issued using CoFox during the first 7:30 can be compared to the Together system, except for the first 2 minutes where the users searching with CoFox have issued fewer queries. This is very likely to be due to the initial divison of labour phase by which users organize themselves since it correlates with the Together system.
After minute 7:30 the number of queries issued using CoFox drops signifi-cantly, and remains lower than the other systems for the rest of the session. If we also consider figure 2(b), the peak representing the range of time when the higher number of relevant pages are visited correlates with the time before the number of queries drops in figure 3(b). This is evidence of the earlier fulfilment of the information seeking activity by many users when using CoFox, which confirms what the users have qualitatively expressed in the questionnaires.
Another observation is that even as the number of queries issued by users when searching with CoFox drops and becomes lower than in other systems, as seen in figure 3(b), the frequency of rele vant pages being visited remains higher than any of the baseline systems.

To further evaluate H2 we examine figure 3(a). This figure shows a plot of the frequency associated with changing from own tab to another. Intuitively the pages in the tabs can be considered as relevant as users do not want to get rid of, and they partially fullfil their information need. Therefore the more switching amongst tabs, the more possibly relevant pages are being considered as solutions to the task at hand. In figure 3(a) CoFox follows an incremental distribution where the other systems beh ave more linearly, suggesting that users are considering more documents towards their final answer. Further evidence can be found near the ending of the tasks the switching between tabs frequency increases rapidly as users revisit the tabs to copy and include the URLs into the solutions they propose for the task. Based on these observations we can evaluate that CoFox helps collaborating users t o be more effective when performing a collaborative information seeking task, thus confirming H2.

User satisfaction is measured through the feedback gained from the question-naries, after the users have performed each of the tasks. Table 3 shows descrip-tive values extracted from the answers t o those questionnaires. When users were asked to rate their level of agreement to the statement:  X  X sing CoFox is effort-less X  in a likert scale of 7 points, 7 being strongly agree and 1 strongly disagree, the mean of their answers was 6.11 with a std deviation of 1.57. This shows that the users felt really comfortable using CoFox, probably due to the familiarity brought by its user interface. When the u sers rated the statements:  X  X oFox can be used effectively without instruction X  and  X  X oFox is easy to learn X , the results were also very positive, which shows tha t CoFox has a very small learning curve. Likewise users also shown a very high l evel of agreement when asked to rate the statement:  X  X oFox works the way I want X .

Furthermore, the users were asked to rate their agreement with the statement:  X  X  was comfortable and in control of the system at all times X  for each of the systems right after they performed one of the given tasks. The means are very high in all the systems, but looking closely to the data, we can observe that the rating for CoFox has a much lower Std Deviation, showing a higher level of agreement amongts users.
To further evaluate the user satisfaction the users were optionally asked to state what they liked and what they disliked about the different systems. For the Solo system the users stated  X  X ou can do what you want X  and  X  X t is most efficient for most cases  X .
 The comments for attributed to the Toge ther system include  X  X lower because there is only one computer X ;  X  X he ideas of both users are not developed com-pletely X ;  X  X refer to speak rather than cha t X ;  X  X aster to evaluate results X ;  X  X an-not be as objective as with CoFox X ;  X  X en erates more conflict and discussion X . Finally the comments arised by the use of CoFox are  X  X aves time because of division of labour X ;  X  X o conflict to use the computer X ;  X  X oFox is more fun to search with X ;  X  X iberty of being able to work yourself and at the same time con-tributing to the task X ;  X  X llows me to discuss information with someone who is not co-located, so distance is not a problem anymore X ;  X  X etter organization than Together X ;  X  X t is comfortable to see what the other user is doing X  and  X  X eep control over the computer X 
CoFox receives most of the positive comments which can be considered as evidence of a higher user satisfaction. It was observed that CoFox may be less efficient in non-collaborative tasks than the baselines, as some users stated  X  X olo is Most efficient for most cases X , as the system might be an annoyance for non-collaborative tasks. Furthermore a study carried out by Morris [7] shows that a very low number of people engage in collaborative searches in a daily or weekly basis (0.9% and 25.7% respectively), therefore this user is right in stating that the Solo baseline system will be better for most cases.

Assuming a collaborative task is to be carried out by a pair of users, they ex-perience a higher satisfaction using CoFox and the collaborative tools it provides, thus confirming H3. In this paper, we propose a system for paired synchronous collaborative web browsing namely CoFox. CoFox has been designed to support awareness, divi-sion of labour and independence. An evaluation was carried out to assess CoFox X  X  effectiveness, overall user satisfaction and capability to support users in finding relevant information, by performing a series of experiments and then compar-ing the acquired data against the two baseline systems. In the other hand, we also explore the differences in search strategies between the baseline systems and the proposed collaborative system. Through the analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data extracted from the experiments, we demonstrate that Co-Fox is an effective tool for collaborative searching, assuming that users have a common information need and they are trying to complete a collaborative task. Users manage to build more efficient queries which allows them to find more rel-evant documents in a smaller timeframe , even thought there is a communication overhead. This study have important practical implications as users over the internet are evolving to be everyday more sociable. Internet browsing is slowly changing from an activity performed individually to a more social and collabo-rative activity. A possible way to extend this study is to introduce explicit col-laborative query suggestion. A pair of users with a common information need, could benefit from being able to keep a s ummary of the queries that each other have issued to the search engine as well as the pages visited as a result of each of the queries. Suggestions could be drawn from the comparison of query histo-ries so users can benefit from their partn er X  X  search or perform a more efficient division of labour. Another possible way to extend this study is to create the infrastructure to allow more users to effectively take part in the search. This rep-resents a challenge since awareness supported through a video stream between more than 2 users becomes tricky due to space constrains. Therefore a balance in the amount of information shown needs to be achieved to avoid cluttering the interface and unnecessarily distracting the users.
