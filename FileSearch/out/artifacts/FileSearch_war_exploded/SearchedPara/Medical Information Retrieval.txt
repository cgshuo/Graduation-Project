 Due to an explosion in the amount of medical information available, search techniques are gaining importance in the medical domain. This tutorial discusses recent results on search in the medical domain, including the outcome of sur-veys on end user requirements, research relevant to the field, and current medical and health search applications available. Finally, the extent to which available techniques meet user requirements are discussed, and open challenges in the field are identified.

Search techniques are becoming increasingly important in the medical domain, in particular due to an explosion in the amount of medical information available. This includes both patient-specific information (e.g. electronic health records) and knowledge-based information (e.g. scientific papers). The increasing emphasis on the use of evidence-based medicine (using the best evidence from the scientific literature in clin-ical decision making) also increases the importance of search in medical practice [10]. Furthermore, the secondary use of anonymized electronic health records for facilitating research and improving quality in medical practice is also gaining in importance [7]. This use of health records also requires IR techniques, and has been modelled in the new TREC medi-cal records track in 2011.

All parties involved in medical treatment are regularly faced with an information need that cannot be met from their own store of knowledge. Medical information search is a classic example of a domain-specific search , but the medi-cal domain is so complex that simply limiting the target doc-uments to those in the medical domain and indexing with a standard search engine is not sufficient. The range of sources of medical information (primary research sources, secondary research sources, web pages and popular publications, etc.) and the range of end users (members of the general pub-lic, general practitioners, specialists, researchers, etc.) lead to complex requirements. Recent work in the Khresmoi project 1 has collected end user requirements for search in the medical domain through online surveys, interviews and observation [17, 9, 3, 14]. The results of the requirement analysis are presented based on a model of domain-specific search, for which the following aspects need to be specified: information sources to restrict the search, search refinements that can improve the access to information in the domain, and end users and their tasks.

Although many groups of people search for information in the medical domain, the analysis in the Khresmoi project has been restricted to three of the most important groups: search by physicians , search by members of the general pub-lic and search by radiologists (a subset of physicians for which search in images is of particular importance). Dif-ferent end users have different requirements based on the technical level (accessibly or technically written), level of specificity (overview or in-depth), type of research paper (primary or secondary), language of the results, etc. Natu-rally, the trustworthiness of medical information is of par-ticular importance. Analyses of search behaviour based on search engine log files have also been done [4, 18].
For physicians, an unmet information need has been re-ported as occurring for 2 of every 3 patients seen [11], or for 41% of the questions they pursued [6]. This requires that they attempt to meet this information need by using avail-able resources, which has traditionally involved searching in printed sources and asking colleagues, although searching on the Internet is of increasing importance. The Khresmoi sur-vey has shown that the three most common sources of online information used by physicians (in decreasing order of us-age) are: general search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo!), medical research databases (e.g. Pubmed) and Wikipedia. Image search is particularly important in the medical do-main, especially for radiologists [16]. Internet image search applications are starting to appear (e.g. Goldminer, Yot-talook). However, image search within Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) in hospitals is also be-ing developed [15].

Patients also have regular information needs, illustrated by the fact that 61% of American Adults seek out health ad-vice online [8]. The Khresmoi survey of the general public http://khresmoi.eu revealed that the most common sources of online informa-tion used by this group are: general search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo!), web sites providing health informa-tion (e.g. university, hospital, pharmaceutical company) and Wikipedia. However, as this group has had less training in interpreting the information found, issues such as trustwor-thiness of the information and cyberchondria [20] gain more importance.

A number of publications of work towards meeting the re-quirements for search in the medical domain have recently appeared. This includes work on estimating the granularity of information in a document [21], estimating the difficulty of a document [5, 12], the quality of documents [19], docu-ment summarization [1] and the use of terminology resources for query refinement [13]. Cross-lingual search is of impor-tance for end users at all levels [2]. The tutorial presents how well this work meets the requirements and discusses the remaining challenges for search in the medical domain.
The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 257528 (KHRES-MOI). [1] S. Afantenos, V.
