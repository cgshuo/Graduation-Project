 of people can be modeled as an in formation flow issue, in which people intentionally or unintentiona lly influence and inspire each other, thus creating an interest in retrieving or getting a specific kind of information or product. Information flow models how information is propagated in a soci al network. It can be a real social network where interactions between people reside; it can be, moreover, a virtual social networ k in that people only influence each other unintentionally, for instance, through collaborative filtering. We leverage users X  access patterns to model information flow and generate effective pers onalized recommendations. First, an early adoption based information flow (EABIF) network describes the influential relations hips between people. Second, based on the fact that adoption is typically category specific, we propose a topic-sensitive EABIF (TEABIF) network, in which access patterns are clustered with respect to the categories. Once an item has been accessed by early adopters, personalized recommendations are achieved by estimating whom the information will be propagated to with high probabilities. In our experiments with an online document recommendation system, the results demonstrate that the EABIF and the TEABIF can respectively achieve an improved (precision, recall) of (91.0%, 87.1%) and (108.5%, 112.8%) compared to traditional collaborative filtering, given an early adopter exists. [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Information Filtering Keywords: Information flow, personalized recommendation, collaborative filtering usually goes beyond his lim ited processing capabilities. Recommender systems can help users to deal with information information flow. Modeling the propagation of the trust scores is a fundamental building block in many of today's most successful e-commerce and recommendation system s. [8, 18] try to predict trust and distrust between any two users based on a trust propagation model. Information propagation through blog space was also recently studied [19]. In this paper, we use the terms  X  X nformation propagation X  and  X  X nformation flow X  interchangeably to represent the same concept. classifies adopters of innovations into five categories based on the idea that certain individuals are inevitably more open to adoption than others in a social network. The innovation can be an idea, a practice, or an object. The five adopter categories, (1) innovators, (2) early adopters, (3) early major ity, (4) late majority, and (5) laggards, follow a standard deviation curve. Innovators adopt the innovation at the beginning (2.5%); early adopters make up for 13.5% a short time later; the early majority is 34%; the late majority is 34%; and finally the laggards make up for 16%. It is also referred to as the Multi-Step Flow Theory or Diffusion of Innovations Theory. will a user X like an item Y ? We view the problem from another perspective by asking the question: given that a user X acts on an item Y who will then be more likely to act on the item Y ? The fact that two users access or purchase the same item sequentially is modeled as an information flow process : the information is flowing from early adopters to late adopters . We do not explicitly explore how the early adopter influences the late adopter. There may be existing social network connections between these two users. Or, these two persons may have hab its of watching the same TV channel, one in the morning and one in the evening, showing the same advertisement. We consider, as long as there are consistent time-based user access patterns, then the appearance of the early adopter accesses an item indicates his late adopter is very likely to access soon. On the other hand, the early adopter may not be interested in the items that the late adopter accesses. This time-factor was not previously addressed by collaborative filtering recommendation methods. weighted directed network, which we call Early Adoption Based Information Flow (EABIF) network, based on pair-wise comparisons to describe how likely each user make adoptions earlier than the other user. Then we propose to model information flow behavior of a node by using ergodic Markov chains, in which communicate), so that the converge nce is guaranteed. Furthermore, considering that adoption is typically category-specific, we proposed a topic-sensitive early adoption based information flow (TEABIF) network. Personalized recommendation is exploited as an application, which addresses the question of  X  X f one user or multiple users access an item, who else will likely follow these early adopters and access this item next? X  In a social network, this process is similar to when one node is triggered, then subsequently which other nodes in the network w ill also be triggered. Figure 1 illustrates the overall structure of our proposed personalized recommendation driven by information flow scheme. of each path, it is possible to get the final information receiving probabilities of the nodes (as illustrated as the bars in Figure 3.) rank of the users who are more likely to adopt an item after u , rather than the exact probabilities that thes e users will adopt. In this paper, we make an assumption that the information flow is similar to the water flow, in which information is not duplicated through propagation. Imposing this assumption seems to be artificial. However, it provides an ergodic Markov chain property that guarantees convergence and simplifies the calculation of final-state probabilities, while keeping the rank of users. Thus, the system can be implemented and executed efficiently. represent the adoption patterns. Then we generate an early adoption based information flow network as a Markov chain for personalized recommendation. information of each user, including the timestamp of each adoption, for each pair of users, we compar e their timestamps of adopting the same items, and record how many items one user adopts earlier than the other into an early adopti on matrix (Figure 4). Then, we represent this matrix using a weighted directed graph ( ) , Gnl , where each node n corresponds to a user and l represents the non-negative weight on each edge. We have an edge with weight , uv l if among the items that u and v accessed in common, , uv l of these items were accessed by u earlier than v .

An edge () , uv with , 0 uv l = means that among the common items that u and v adopt, u always adopts l equals the total number of items adopted by u and v . A large adopts the items earlier than User v . the stationary distributio n. By this definition, F is constructed as a primitive stochastic matrix to model the probabilities of information moving from one node to another. In our experiments, we found that the results are insensitive to the value of  X  and set 0.5  X  = . We call this generated irreducible Markov chain with F as the transition probability matrix is called Early Adoption Based Information Flow (EABIF) Network. categories or topics; an early adopter of fashion may not be an early adopter of technology. We have utilized people X  X  different social networks regarding different topics through emails in [9] to model and predict human activities. In this paper we will follow the same intuition to generate the topic-sensitive information flow networks for recommendations. Here we consider items as documents for topic analysis. The basic idea is that people may tend to get information of certain topics ear lier than others, while for some other topics, they may be not so eager to obtain that. Thus to get the more consistent early/late behavior patterns, we cluster documents into latent topics and then build the networks based on how likely one user accesses the documents regarding to a certain topic earlier or later than the other users. topics. Latent Dirichlet Allocatio n is a well-defined probabilistic generative model, which can be generalized easily to new documents. And, the number of parameters does not grow with the size of the training corp us. Thus, it is not prone to overfitting. Given T topics ( T is determined by using cross-validation), the probability of the i th word in a given document is formularized as: where i z is a latent variable indicating the topic from which the i th word was drawn, and () | w under the j th topic. ( ) word from topics j in the current document, which varies across different documents. Gibbs sampling [30] is applied to the probability of topic j in document d [16]. a cluster j with a probability () d j  X  with () cluster (topic), a topic adoption matrix as well as a weighted directed graph are generated for all users. If User u accesses a document earlier than User v , and this document is clustered into well as the weight from u to v in the weighted graph. Then these T weighted networks, with each one co rresponding to a topic are used to generate Markov chains with a primitive stochastic matrix as the transition probability matrix i F is constructed for each topic i . These uniform distribution, Eq. (5) can be calculated as: where m is the number of propagation steps. When m = 1, pairwise relationship. propagation steps in the network with N users being ( 1 N  X  ), Eq. (5) is equal to which can be calculated as where I is a N N  X  unit matrix. FU  X  UU  X  UU U matrix, which has only one eigenvalue on the unit circle, all other 1 N  X   X  X  =&gt;&gt;&gt; L . When the number of users in the network ( N ) power method applied to a primitive stochastic matrix F is guaranteed to converge to the unique dominant eigenvector X  X he stationary distribution. As a result, there is no issue with convergence of the ranking vector, and any positive probability vector can be used to start the iterative process. Further, the convergence rate of the method is determined by the magnitude of the subdominant eigenvalue of the transition rate matrix. Thus, we have After () N F is calculated by Eq. (10) and insert into Eq. (9), (1) if N  X  F is propagation because their direct relationship to the users. Thus, we consider assigning less importance to longer paths: adopters. Then we predict who else will most likely adopt the documents following these early adopters. Hence, instead of directly making document recommendations to users, we predict the potential adopters of each document. This strategy is suitable for online document/product pushing service or advertisement  X  recommending the items to potential customers according to the behaviors of early adopters. It can also be transferred to the traditional recommendation scenario by estimating how likely one user will be interested in the documents and recommending those top-ranked documents to him or her. precision and recall of the recommendations. Precision represents the ability of the system to withhol d non-relevant users, which is measured as the proportion of recommended users who adopt the documents in the test period. Recall represents the ability of the algorithm to present all relevant us ers, which is measured as the proportion of the recommended users over all the users who adopted the documents in the test period. The values we report here are the respective average of the precisions and recalls for these 586 documents. algorithms as following: 1.

The number of propagation steps equals to 1, in which only the pairwise information flow is considered. The recommendations are achieved by ranking the probabilities in the row which corresponds to how information flows from this triggered user to the others in the matrix F . Comparing to CF, on average, EABIF is 91.0% better and TEABIF is 108.5% better in terms of precisions. Comparing to EABIF, TEABIF improves 19.2% further. In terms of recalls, on average, EABIF is 87.1% better and TEABIF is 112.8% better than CF. Comparing to EABIF, TEABIF improves 29.5% further. the earliest two to access a particular document, and then predict whom else will also likely access this document. Note the precisions and recalls cannot be directly compared to the results in the first experiment because the ground truth is different in these situations. For instance, there are totally ten users accessing one document in the test period, if we trigger one user, the other nine users are ground truth for reco mmendation. However, if we trigger two users, the other eight users are the ground truth. become active increases monotonic ally as more neighbors become active. The probability of one user will access the document among all the users is the summation of the according probabilities in the rows wh ich are corresponding to how information flows from the triggered users to this user in the matrix F . Then the system recommends by ranking the probabilities of all users. the similar performance in the first experiment. On average, EABIF is 62.2% better than CF, and TEABIF is 72.4% better than CF in terms of precision. Comparing to EABIF, TEABIF improves 16.4% further. Comparing to CF, on average, EABIF is 50.2% better, TEABIF is 66.8% be tter in terms of recall. Comparing to EABIF, TEABI F improves 33.1% further. models, including changing the number of propagation steps from 1 to 5 (labeled as 1, 2 , , 5 m = K ), direct summation, and exponential weighted summation when 1,1.5, 2,..., 5,8, and 16  X  = . number of triggered users is one (Figure 7(a,b)) or two (Figure 7(c,d)). Among all propagation models, when the number of triggered users is one (Figure 7(a,b)), TEABIF with exponential weighted summation ( 3  X  = ) achieves the best performance and improves 108.5% on precision and 116.9% on recall comparing to CF. Using the same propagation model (exponent ial weighted summation ( 3  X  = )), EABIF improves 91.0% in terms of precision, and 95.5% in terms of recall comparing to CF. Comparing to the number of propa gation steps equals one, EABIF improves 25.3%, and TEABIF im proves 28.3% in terms of precision; EABIF improves 17.1%, and TEABIF improves 9.8% in terms of recall. 7(c,d) compares the precision and recall improvement comparing to CF.

However, the performance which TEABIF with direct summation achieves is much better than EABIF with direct summation even though it is not among the best performances. This phenomenon verifies again that users X  adoption patterns are topic sensitive. An early adopter of one topic is not necessary to be the early adopter of another topic. Therefore, long-path propagation is not as effective for the topic-independent model  X  EABIF, as that of TEABIF which considers early adoption patterns regarding the same topic. The direct summa tion and exponential weighted summation when 8  X   X  have achieved the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. TEABIF with m = 4~5 achieves similar performance to the best performance, which can serve as a simpler approximation to the more complex models. large  X  of all the paths with different lengths converge to the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. Long-path propagation is not as effective fo r the topic-independent model  X  EABIF, as that of TEABIF which considers early adoption patterns within the same topic. Overall, short-path propagations play more important roles than long-path propagations because the direct relationship among th e users is more reliable. information flow network for a recommendation system. By comparing the timestamps when users access documents, an early adoption based information flow (EABIF) network is proposed. Furthermore, observing that adoption is typically category-specific, we propose a topic-sensitive early adoption based information propagation (TEABIF) network, in which users X  adoption patterns are clustered regarding the topics of the documents they accessed. Three information propagation models are proposed to predict how specific information will propagate through the network, given known triggers. Thus we proposed a novel perspective that a recommendation problem can be addressed as: once an item is adopted by one or more users, who else in the network will also likely to adopt it. Filtering, EABIF with one-step propagation prediction improves 91.0% and 87.1%, and TEABI F with one-step propagation prediction improves 108.5% and 112.8% on precision and recall respectively. Furthermore, comparing to the one-step propagation prediction, EABIF with informa tion propagation models improves 25.3% and 17.1%, and TEABIF w ith information propagation models improves 28.3% and 9.8% fu rther on precision and recall respectively. When more users serve as the triggers, similar performance is achieved. In conc lusion, the proposed algorithms demonstrate effective recommendation results. where ratings are discrete and also comparing with the item-item recommenders. We will also appl y the information flow models for modeling topic propagation in blogspace. collecting and preprocessing the data. This work was supported by funds from NEC Laboratories America.
