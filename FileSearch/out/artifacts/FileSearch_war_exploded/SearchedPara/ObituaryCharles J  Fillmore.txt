Charles J. Fillmore died at his home in Sa n Francisco on February 13, 2014, of brain cancer. He was 84 years old. Fillmore was one of the world X  X  pre-eminent scholars of lexical meaning and its relationship with context, grammar, corpora, and computation, and his work had an enormous impact on computational linguistics. His early theoret-ical work in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s on case grammar and then frame semantics significantly influenced computational lingu istics, AI, and knowledge representation.
More recent work in the last two decades o n FrameNet, a computational lexicon and annotated corpus, influenced corpus linguis tics and computational lexicography, and led to modern natural language understa nding tasks like semantic role labeling.
University of Minnesota. As an undergraduate he worked on a pre-computational Latin corpus linguistics project, alphabetizing i ndex cards and building concordances. During his service in the Army in the early 1950s he was stationed for three years in Japan.
After his service he became the first US sold ier to be discharged locally in Japan, and stayed for three years studying Japanese. He supported himself by teaching English, pioneering a way to make ends meet that afterwards became popular with generations of young Americans abroad. In 1957 he moved back to the United States to attend graduate school at the University of Michigan.

American Structuralist tradition of deve loping what were called  X  X iscovery proce-dures X  for linguistic analysis, algorithms for inducing phones or parts of speech. Dis-covery procedures were thought of as a methodological tool, a formal procedure that linguists could apply to data to discover linguistic structure, for example inducing parts of speech from the slots in  X  X entence frames X  informed by the distribution of surround-ing words. Like many linguistic graduate students of the period, he also worked partly on machine translation, and was interviewed at the time by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, who was touring US machine translation laboratories in preparation for his famous report on the state of MT (Bar-Hillel 1960).
 Structures and became an immediate proponent of the new transformational grammar. He graduated with his PhD in 1962 and moved to the linguistics department at Ohio
State University. In his early work there Fillmore developed a number of early formal properties of generative grammar, such as the idea that rules would re-apply to repre-sentations in iterative stage s called cycles (Fillm ore 1963), a formal mechanism that still plays a role in modern theories of generative grammar. that began with his early work on case grammar (Fillmor e 1966, 1968, 1971, 1977a).
Fillmore had become interested in argument structure by studying Lucien Tesni` ere X  X  groundbreaking  X  El  X  ements de Syntaxe Structurale (Tesni` ere 1959) in which the term  X  X ependency X  was introduced and the foundations were laid for dependency grammar.
Like many transformational grammarian s of the time, Fillmore began by trying to capture the relationships between distinct formal patterns with systematically related meanings; and he became interested in the d ifferent ways of expressing the object and recipient of transfer in sentences like  X  X e gave a book to me X  and  X  X e gave me a book X  (Fillmore 1962, 1965), a phenomenon that became known as dative movement .
He then expanded to the more general goal of representing how the participants in an event are expressed syntactically, as in these two sentences about an event of opening : plays the role of the instrument of the action and door theroleofthe object , patient , or theme , and suggested that such abstract roles could constitute a shallow level of meaning representation. Following Tesni` ere X  X  terminology, Fillmore first referred to these argument roles as actants (Fillmore 1966) but q uickly switched to the term case , (see Fillmore (2003)) and proposed a universal list of semantic roles or cases (Agent,
Patient, Instrument, etc.), that could be taken on by the arguments of predicates. Verbs would be listed in the lexicon with their  X  X as e frame X , the list of obligatory (or optional) case arguments.
 representation that could help map from syntactic parse structures to deeper, more fully-specified representations of meaning was quickly adopted in natural language processing, and systems for extracting case frames were created for machine translation (W ilks 1973), q uestion-answering (Hendri x, Thompson, and Slocum 1973), spoken-language understanding (Nash-Webber 1975), and dialogue systems (Bobrow et al. 1977). General-purpose semantic role labelers were developed to map to case representations via ATNs (Simmons 1973) or, from parse trees, by using dictionaries with verb-specific case frames (Levin 1977; Marcus 1980). By 1977 case representation was widely used and taught in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, and was described as a standard component of natural language understanding in the first edition of Winston X  X  (1977) textbook Artificial Intelligence .

Berkeley, and by the mid-1970s he began to expand his ideas on case. He arrived at a more general model of semantic representation, one that expressed the background contexts or perspectives by which a word or a case role could be defined. He called this new representation a frame , and later described the intuition as follows: 726
He described the name as coming from  X  X he pre-transformationalist view of sentence structure as consisting of a frame and a substitution list, X  but the word frame seemed to beintheairforasuiteofrelatednotionsproposedataboutthesametimebyMinsky (1974), Hymes (1974), and Goffman (1974), as well as related notions with other names like scripts (Schank and Abelson 1975) and schemata (Bobrow and Norman 1975) (see
Tannen [1979] for a comparison ). Fillmore was also influenced by the semantic field theorists and by a visit to the Yale AI lab where he took notice of the lists of slots and fillers used by early information extracti on systems like DeJong (1982) and Schank and Abelson (1977).
 focusing on the way that words are associated with frames X  X as expressed in a series of papers starting in the mid-1970 X  X  ( Fillmore 1975a, 1976, 1977b, 1982, 1985). His motivating example was the Commerc ial Event frame, in which a seller sells goods to a buyer, the buyer thus buying the goods that cost acertainamountby paying a or scenario. The meaning of each word draws in the entire frame, and by using (or hearing) the word, a language user necessa rily activates the entire frame. As Fillmore put it:
Fillmore also emphasized the way that frames could represent perspectives on events, such that verbs like sell or pay emphasize different aspects of the same event, or that the differences between alternative senses of the same word might come from their drawing on different frames. Fillmore X  X  linguistic i nterpretation of frames influenced work in artificial intelligence on knowledge representation like KRL (Bobrow and Winograd 1977), and the perspective-taking aspect of frames had a strong influence on work on framing in linguistics and politics (Lakoff 2010).
 by the late Antonio Zampolli and met the lex icographer Beryl T. Atkins. The two began a collaboration to produce a frame description for the verb risk based on corpus evidence (Fillmore and Atkin s 1992). This work, incl uding an invited talk at ACL 1991 (Fillmore and Atkins 1991), influenced the development of other projects in corpus-based lexical semantics (Kipper, Dang, and Palmer 2000; Kipper et al. 2008).
 lexical semantics could fruitfully be co mbined (Fillmor e 1992) and when he officially retired from UC Berkeley in 1995 he moved to the International Computer Science
Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley (although still teaching at UC Berkeley part-time) and began work on the FrameNet project of computational corpus lexicography that combined his early ideas on semantic roles with his later work on frames and his recent interest in corpus lexicography.
 of lists of constitutive roles or  X  X rame elements X : sets of words that evoke the frame, grammatical information expressing how eac h frame element is realized in the sentence, and semantic relations between frames and between frame elements. Corpora were annotated with the evoking words, frames, and frame elements (Baker, Fillmore, and
Lowe 1998; Fillmore, Johnson , and Petruck 2003; Fillmore and Baker 2009). especially under the direction of Collin Baker, proceeded to create the frames and hand-annotate the corpora. This period of his career was a productive and enjoyable one for
Fillmore. In an interview for the ICSI Newsletter, he said instantiated in FrameNet, together with the PropBank semantic-role-labeled corpus created soon afterwards by Martha Palmer and colleagues (Palmer, Kingsbury, and
Gildea 2005), led to a revival of automatic approaches to semantic role labeling, first on FrameNet (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000) and then on PropBank data (Gildea and
Palmer 2002, inter alia). The problem first addressed in the 1970s by hand-written rules was thus now generally recast as one of supervised machine learning. The resulting plethora of systems for performing automatic semantic role labeling (see the surveys in Palmer, Gildea, and Xue (2010) and M ` arquez et al. (2008)) have been applied widely to improve the state of the art in tasks across NLP such as question answering (Shen and Lapata 2007; Surdeanu, Ciaramita, and Zaragoza 2011) and machine translation (Liu and Gildea 2010; Lo et al . 2013). Fillmore X  X  FrameNet project also led to the development of FrameNets for many other languages including Spanish, German,
Japanese, Portuguese, Italian, and Chinese. And in a perhaps appropriate return to the discovery procedures that first inspired Fillmore, modern work has focused on ways to induce semantic roles from corpora with out role annotation (Swier and Stevenson 2004; Chambers and Jurafsky 2009, 2011; Lang and Lapata 2014).

Academy of Arts and Sciences, served as presi dent of the Linguistic Society of America, was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago, had festschrifts and conferences in his honor, received the ACL lifetime achievement award in 2012 (see the text of his acceptance speech in Fillmor e [2012]) and, togethe r with Collin Baker, the Antonio Zampolli Prize from ELRA in 2012. Nonetheless, he was unpretentious (universally referred to even by his undergr aduates as  X  X huck X ), modest, embarrassed by compliments, and generally referred to hi mself light-heartedly as an Ordinary Work-ing Linguist. His Minnesota background (he was Norwegian on his mother  X  X  side) always led to Lake Wobegon comparisons, es pecially given his often bemused smile and wry deadpan wit.
