 The ability to comprehend the natural language is one of the most valuable features of intelligent systems. Linguistic studies and designing co mputer algorithms are required for achieving this feature. Many studies have been conducted in this area but only the English language has been studied in most of the cases. English language is more feasible for designing algorithm compared to other langua ges such as German, Chinese, characteristic. Thus, it is essentially significant to have an algorithm which can be used for other languages as well as English.

The methods of representing the sentence grammar have played an important role in the advent of natural language processing algorithms.  X  X hrase structure X  and  X  X ependency grammar X  are two principal methods for syntactic representation. Dependency grammar algorithm is app licable for free word order languages unlike the phrase structure method. Thus, we have applied dependency grammar and characteristics of Persian language for implementation of the algorithm.
 methods include graph, Semantic networks, and use of objects. In this paper, we will represent the natural language in the form of objects with the aid of dependency grammar. A system capable of effectively understanding the natural l anguage can be applied in different usages of natural language including summarization, text categorization, and text translation and so on. Following depiction of understanding procedure of natural language by the objects, this paper proposes a method for application in the intelligent evaluation system; the results of the recommended method are investigated in Persian language.
 Syntactic representation methods are included in section II; variety of applied questions in the evaluations will be presented in section III. The proposed method is investigated in section IV. Section V deals with introducing the stages of converting texts into objects. Subsequently, answer acquisition and its evaluation procedures are analyzed in chapter VI. In chapter VII, beside s introducing the Persian language, the results of the recommended method will be presented for the sample text in Persian language, and finally section VIII will incorporate the conclusions and future activities. Synta ctic representation methods are crucially influential in natural language processing. The texts are analyzed during the stages of syntactic representation of natural language and the meaning of the text is obtained subsequently [1] . Therefore, it is partic ularly significant to be familiar with different syntactic analysis method. Among the syntactic representation methods, dependency grammar and phrase structure algorithms are more remarkably important [2] . 1.1 phrase structure This approach is vitally i mportant as one of the primary methods proposed by Chomsky [3] based on which the Context -free Grammar (CFG) is operated. Every sentence in context -free grammar system consists of several phrases and each phrase is composed of a set of words. These languag es are also referred as  X  X ormal languages X . The grammar written based upon the formal language is called  X  X enerative Grammar X  [4]. Context -free grammars comprise a set of rules and symbols; the symbols, in turn, are divided into terminal and non -terminal symbols [2]. 1.2 Grammar Representation based on the Dependency This method was innovated by Teniere [5] as a novel approach in modern linguistics. In this method, the syntactic structure comprises words which are related to each other through asymmetric al dual relationships [6]; these relationships are called  X  X ependency X . In this representation method, it is emphasized that every sentence has a central verb, and the sentence structure can be determined using the central verb and the type and number of i ts mandatory and optional complements. In other words, this method rejects the former procedures which used to emphasize on division of the sentences into subject and predicate [7]. Each verb imposes specific states of dependencies; the syntactic capacity is one of the most significant concepts in the dependency grammar. The fundamental structure of a sentence is determined based on its central verb [8]. 1.3 Comparison of methods One of the major differences between the dependency and generative methods a rises from the value or position they consider for the subject of the sentence. The generative grammar, from the beginning , divides the sentence into main parts of noun phrase verb. Engel believes [ 9 ] the sentence division into subject and predicate mainly exhibits the information structure and the distribution of the new or old data rather than representing the syntactic structure of the sentence.
 free constituent order. The dependency grammar is an appropriate candidate for this purpose due to its structure [2]. The evaluation systems are able to ask the questions from users in different ways. The different approaches for posing the question comprise following methods [10] : Multiple -choice items include a set of responses. For each question, you must choose the best response. With true/false items, you are given a sentence to read, and you must decide whether the sentence is true or false. Fill -in -th e -blank items are sentences with key words missing. You must fill in the missing word or phrase. You may be given a list of answer words to choose from. Short -answer questions are items that are answered by writing a few words or sen tences. An essay is writing that you do in response to a question or prompt. Essay questions test whether you have a deep understanding of your subject.
 For Evaluating short -answer or essay questions, the natural language processing is requ ired due to necessity of analysis. Many examinations including TOEFL and PhD entrance exams in many countries include essay questions. Furthermore, contests with essay questions can be held via SMS in which it may take a lot of time to evaluate all the ans wers because of the large number of participants; human errors might also occur in these evaluations. It is very effective to enjoy a system having the ability to investigate the answers intelligently and calculate the grade acquired for every person. In the proposed algorithm, the questions and correct answers are separately received by the system in the form of natural language. Then, the accurate answer for each question is converted into objects which represent the object -based representations of the input texts. In the subsequent step, the user inputs the relevant answer for each question objects. For analyzing the accuracy level of the answers, the created objects are compared with each other and the answering grades are calculated.

The procedures of designing the stages were carried out in a way that can be used for different natural languages; in other words, not applicable only for a specific language. However, in the conducted researches, the procedures were studied only for Persian language which assumes a free word order.
 All stages of the system have been illustrated in figure 1 ; the procedures start from data input in the form of natural language and continue up to analyzing the answers and calculating the users X  grades: According to above figure, the recommended system consists of two main phases; the questions and correct answers are received in the first phase; then, the users X  answers are acquired, evaluated and graded in the second phase. We have used objects for understanding the natural language in the proposed method. Accordingly, each time a distinctive layer yields the object -based structure by acquisition of natural language. In the object -based r epresentation, several objects might be obtained from the input text, and some relations are established between the objects whenever necessary. For converting the input text into objects, the stages are conducted as illustrated in figure 2 .
 The stages illustrated in the figure are performed as follows: 4.1 Generation of initial objects 4.1.1 Word Class and Pos Tagging: only the word stem has been stored so as to reduce the size of the database. In the second part, based on the linguistic rules, the word is investigated in terms of having affixes; it is then analyzed and assigned the appropriate tag if necessary.
 characteristics. If a word has been assigned several tags in word class tagging stage  X  for example the word  X   X  X  X  X   X  in Persian language, considering the multiple -meaning  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  (people). Then, as this word is investigated simultaneously and in association with other words in this stage, the multiple -tag words can be disambiguated according to the word function in the sentence and the adjoining words in the text . The result of this stage is saved in Pos.xml file. 4.1.2 Frame Generation A frame is generated by separately tag ging for each sentence. Each frame includes slots to be filled by sentence constituents. The frame slots vary for every sentence and depend on the verb of the sentence. Dependency grammar characteristics are applied in this part. For instance, the verb  X  X a t X  will need an  X  X bject X  dependent and a  X  X ubject X  dependent (What was eaten?) (Who ate it?). Thus, the frame of the verb  X  X at X  has got two slots. For example, for the sentences  X  X y name is Sanova. I work in the university X , two frames will be generated as indicated in figure 3 : 4.1.3 Converting frames into initial objects In Persian language, every sentence has a specific person based on its verb. This person can be  X  X irst person/ second person/ third person X  singular or plural. In other words, there are totally 6 persons. Accordingly, an initial object is created for every frame. The object name is a number from1 to 6 (1: for first person singular, 2: for second person singular, etc).

There exist som e properties and a method inside the initial object. The method in the initial object is the same as the verb (action) of the sentence; the predicates are included as properties. The method can also have some dependents. For example, the initial objects fo r the frames generated in the previous part are created as shown in figure 4 . 4.1.4 Generation of final objects Presence of references as pronouns and relations between sentences necessitates us to combine the objects. In this stage, several objects may form an object, i.e. all the properties and methods pertaining to a subject are merged into an object. Moreover, a n object may be converted into several objects. For instance: two objects of the previous example are converted into the two objects displayed in figure 5 . According to former discussions, the lexi cological relations between words are stored in the database. Variety of object -based relations might be generated in the objects combination stage; e.g. an object may inherit from another object. converted again into objects for evaluation. For this purpose, the module explained in section 5 is applied. The objects obtained from users X  answers will be compared with objects generat ed from correct answers allowing the users X  grades to be evaluated. For certain questions, the order of answer parts is important; therefore, at the time of generation of object from the correct answer, each part is assigned an identifier which determines the order. The sensitivity to answer is also activated for that question. Sometimes mentioning all the items is required for gaining the whole grade in questions having answers in the form of lists of items, or the grade is divided so long as some of the items are responded. These facts are also stored when generating the objects from the correct answers for every question. Persian, also known as Farsi or Parsi, is an Indo -European language spoken a nd written primarily in Iran, Tajikistan and parts of Afghanistan. Persian alphabet contains 32 letters. Persian is written from right to left. Some other languages like Arabic, Kurdish, and Urdu use Persian's form of penmanship but have their own specific ations. Persian also has its own specifications such as not using accents (except in special cases) and polymorphism in writing . The language has remained remarkably stable since the eighth [11] .
 Based on the dependency grammar, there are a number of dependents for any verb in verb dependents have been determined for English, Chinese, German and Persian languages respectively. The current discussions are based upon the verb dependents in Persian language. Considering the free word order structure of Persian language, every sentence can be written in several forms while all the forms co nvey the same meaning. We generate the same object from different forms of a sentence with the aid of the objects generated by dependency grammar.

In the implementation for Persian language, a text is initially received by the user interface. The determin ation of the boundaries of words and sentences below the first phase sub modules, class tagging is performed for each word. The results of this stage are saved in a XML file. For example, if the answer for the question  X  X hat does Sanova do? X  is the sentenc es  X  X he goes to a journey. She travels with bus X ; then, according to the correct answer, the wordclass.xml is firstly created, and the tagging operation is subsequently done in sentence level by performing syntactic processing on this file resulting in the creation of pos.xml file as indicated in figure 6 .
 The frames of each sentence are generated using the XML files and then the corresponding objects of the frames are created. The created frames and objects have bee n illustrated in figure 7 . When the set of objects was generated for each correct answer, the examinee inputs the relevant answer to each question via the user interface; the user X  X  answer is in tur n converted to a relevant object. For example, if in the answer to the previous question the user replies  X  X anova goes to a journey X ; following the creation of respective XML files, the object demonstrated in figure 8 is created. The object generated from user X  X  answer is compared with the object created from the correct answer. The two objects may not be completely identical but they might have common methods or attributes for which the user X  X  grade must b e evaluated based on the discussions in section 6. Understanding the natural language by computers is one of the important matters in the area of information recovery systems. Many phrase structure algorithms have been propo sed for natural language processing. The discrepancy of phrase structure system in the free word order languages revealed the significance of using dependency grammar algorithms.
 Applying dependency grammar and conversion of natural language into obje cts, the computers can have a better comprehension of the natural language. The results of understanding the natural language can be used in different applications such as text summarization, text categorization, text translation systems and so on. We applied t he system in the evaluation and grading system of essay questions in order to manifest the capability of the proposed method. The complexity of natural language processing and the phrase structure method of the natural language processing have resulted in the absence of considerable researches in the field of devising machines for evaluation of users X  answers to essay questions. Using the Recommended method, a better comprehension of the natural language can be provided for the computers. Acknowledgement s .
