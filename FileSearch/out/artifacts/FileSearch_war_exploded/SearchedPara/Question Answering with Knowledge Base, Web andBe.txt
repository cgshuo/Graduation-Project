 In this tutorial, we give the audience a coherent overview of the research of question answering (QA). We first introduce a variety of QA problems proposed by pioneer researchers and briefly describe the early efforts. By contrasting with the current research trend in this domain, the audience can easily comprehend what technical problems remain challeng-ing and what the main breakthroughs and opportunities are during the past half century. For the rest of the tutorial, we select three categories of the QA problems that have recently attracted a great deal of attention in the research commu-nity, and present the tasks with the latest technical survey. We conclude the tutorial by discussing the new opportuni-ties and future directions of QA research.
Developing a Question Answering (QA) system to au-tomatically answer natural-language questions has been a long-standing research problem since the dawn of AI, for its clear practical and scientific value. For instance, whether a system can answer questions correctly is a natural way to evaluate a machine X  X  understanding of a domain. Provid-ing succinct and precise answers to informational queries is also the direction pursued by the next generation of search engines that aim to incorporate more  X  X emantics X , as well as the basic function in digital assistants like Siri and Cor-tana. The tutorial starts from the historical background, but puts more emphasis on recently emerging approaches, such as leveraging structured and semi-structured informa-tion sources, in addition to a large-scale corpus. We se-lect three categories of the QA problems that have recently attracted a great deal of attention in the research com-munity. The first two categories regard answering factoid questions, where the main difference of the problem settings is the information source used for extracting answers. QA with knowledge base aims to answer natural language ques-tions using real-world facts stored in an existing, large-scale database. Examples of the most recent KB-based QA sys-
This tutorial aims to present the current state of research 1. The audience will acquire the basic understanding and overview of the emerging topics of question answering. 2. The audience will learn and understand some of the current research work, as well as industry practices using IR, NLP and ML techniques in question answer-ing. The audience will also be able to incorporate some aspects of what has been learned into their own work. 3. The audience will be able to identify a few research di-rections that could have big impact in the near future.
The topic of Question Answering is timely for the IR com-
To our knowledge, no recent Question Answering tutorial Ma and Yan Ke briefly introduced Question Answering in the context of Entity Recommendation and Understanding. In comparison, this tutorial covers more in-depths introduc-tion to QA-related problems and solutions.
The main content of this tutorial consists of the histori-cal background of the question answering research, detailed description of open-domain factoid question answering ap-proaches using structured and unstructured information sources, and introduction to recent, non-factoid question answering tasks. The outline is listed below.
