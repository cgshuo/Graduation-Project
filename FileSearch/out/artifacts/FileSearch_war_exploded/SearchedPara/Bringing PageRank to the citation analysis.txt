 1. Introduction
Basically, all research performance evaluation systems deal with the concept of quality. Among the various methods that have been proposed and used to complement the traditional research performance evaluation measures, citation analysis was and still is one of the most widely used ( Chubin &amp; Hackett, 1990; Martin, 1996; Thomas &amp; Watkins, 1998 ).
 In most previous researches of citation analysis ( Garfield, 1979, 1983; Gla  X  nzel, 1996; Koenig, 1982, 1983;
Kostoff, 1996; Lawani &amp; Bayer, 1983; Narin, 1976; Narin &amp; Hamilton, 1996 ), the metric used to quantify the importance of scientific publications has been largely based on integer counting of their citations. Although, the number of citations gives a direct approximation of a paper X  X  importance, we may still experience some situations when citations do not seem to provide a full picture of the academic prestige of a paper. In this regard, several studies ( Moed, 2002; van Raan, 1996, 1997 ) have yielded to construct alternative metrics for measuring research influence in an advanced way, such as the indicators of CPP , JCSm , FCSm , CPP / JCSm and CPP / FCSm , 1 etc.

While most of the citation analyses have been based on how many times the papers were cited, we are thus motivated to study from another perspective which concerns more about who actually cited the papers and the prestige they have transferred to the cited papers. And the Google X  X  PageRank algorithm ( Page, Brin, Motwani, &amp; Winograd, 1998 ) is such an existing metric used for the evaluation of Web pages. The PageRank algorithm is an important component of the Google X  X  search engine, and boosted sev-eral studies on the link analysis of the Web ( Kleinberg, 1999; Snyder &amp; Rosenbaum, 1999 ). Actually, the principle of PageRank algorithm can be mostly approximated to the indicator of  X  X  journal influence  X  X  sug-gested by Pinski and Narin (1976) , which evaluates the influence of journals by taking into account not sim-ply the number of citations from one journal to the other, but also the influence of the citing journal. As suggested by Bollen, Rodriguez, and van de Sompel (2006) , this procedure is on the other hand related to the  X  X  X nherited status X  X  defined in the social network science (Bonacich, 1987). In the most recent study, Bol-len et al. (2006) bring this idea into an evaluative study on scientific journals by using the weighted PageRank.
 By way of context, we present here a brief reason for choosing the field of  X  X  X iochemistry and Molecular
Biology X  X  in this bibliometric study. Molecular biology has been emerged as a fast growing discipline since the elucidation of DNA molecule by Watson and Crick in 1953 ( Dalpe  X  , 2002 ). Considering the potentially important influence on disease detection, treatment for higher plants and animals, as well as future economic development, many countries have listed the field of  X  X  X olecular Biology X  X  as high priority in their national
S&amp;T plans. As molecular biology becomes more complex and sophisticated, greater attention has been paid to the publication practices within the discipline ( Anderson, 1992; Anon., 1992; He, Zhang, &amp; Teng, 2005; Herbertz &amp; Mu  X  ller-Hill, 1995; Pendlebury, 1990 ).

This study demonstrates the application of PageRank algorithm in the citation network and empirically analyzes the scientific productivity and academic influence of individual countries based on publications and PageRank values in the context of  X  X  X olecular Biology X  X  subject field. Typically, the evaluations of scien-tific impact are built on the citation counts of papers ( Kostoff, 1996; Lawani &amp; Bayer, 1983; Moed, 2002;
Narin &amp; Hamilton, 1996; van Raan, 1996 ). Yet, the citation counting is kind of an approximation of a paper X  X  popularity ( Bollen et al., 2006 ), which could only reflect the academic influence in a limited area. In this case, we would like to bring PageRank, which is based on a different ranking mechanism, to conventional evaluative study on national scientific impact. Since the PageRank algorithm bears more information about the linking relationships between citing and cited papers, we may hopefully shed light on the national scientific impact from another prestige-oriented perspective. 2. The PageRank algorithm
In such complex networks as World Wide Web, an important attribute of a node is the in-degree (out-degree); namely the number of inbound (outbound) links on the node ( Cohen, Havlin, &amp; ben-Avran-ham, 2002 ). The in-degree of a given page could be considered as an approximation of a page X  X  impor-tance or quality ( Page et al., 1998 ). Actually, the underlying idea is borrowed from the efforts in bibliometric study to define the research influence in terms of citations, which is simply read: citation counts are a measure of importance ( Garfield, 1979 ). The PageRank algorithm ( Brin &amp; Page, 1998 ) has extended this idea by not counting the inbound links from all pages equally, but by normalizing via both the importance and the number of outbound links of the neighboring pages. In this respect, the Page-
Rank value could serve as a better measure of importance, as it incorporates the paper X  X  visibility and authority at the same time by taking both the number of citations and prestige of the citing papers into account. Page et al. (1998) defined the PageRank of a Web page A , denoted by PR ( A ), using the following equation: where PR ( T i ) denotes the PageRank of page T i which has connection with page A ; C ( T of outbound links on page T i ; and d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1.

In Eq. (1) , we see that the PageRank of A is recursively defined by the PageRank of those pages that link to page A . Within the algorithm, the PageRank of pages T i is always weighted by the number of outbound links
C ( T i ), leading thereby to a smaller PageRank value transferred from pages T assumed that any additional inbound link to a recipient page A will always increase A  X  X  PageRank. There is a second version of PageRank algorithm as follows: where N is the total number of pages on the web.

Actually, the second version of the algorithm does not differ largely from the first one. However, it can bet-ter explain the metaphor of the original Random Surfing model suggested by Brin and Page (1998) , in which the PageRank of a page is conceived as being the probability for a surfer visiting the page after clicking on many links. Thus, the probability for a surfer keeping clicking on links is given by the damping factor d , which is, depending on the degree of probability, set between 0 and 1. Since the surfer jumps to another page at ran-dom after he stops licking links, the probability therefore is implemented as the complementary part (1 d ) into the algorithm.
 Due to the huge size of actual web, an approximate iterative computation is usually applied to calculate the
PageRank. This means that each page is assigned an initial starting value and the PageRanks of all pages are then calculated in several computation circles based on Eq. (1) or (2) . Take Eq. (1) for an example, the min-imum PageRank of a page is given by (1 d ); while the maximum PageRank is determined as dN +(1 d ).
This maximum can theoretically achieve, only if all Web pages solely link to one page, and this page also solely links to itself. 3. Data and methodology
In this work, we apply Eq. (1) of PageRank algorithm to the citation network with the goal of measuring the importance of scientific publications from another perspective. Using the seed journals in the category of  X  X  X iochemistry and Molecular Biology X  X  as an entrance to the SCI papers during the time period 2000 X 2005, a relevant subject environment is established by taking all these journal papers into consideration. Although the
JCR X  X  coverage of journals in each subject category has been changing year by year, we find that the included journals have remained at 261 during 2003 X 2005 in the field of  X  X  X iochemistry and Molecular Biology X  X . In this context, we determine the seed journals to be the 261 journals simply based on the 2005 JCR Science Edition.
Given the selected 261 journal names and predetermined time period 2000 X 2005, the 236,517 papers were searched in ISI databases, limiting to the document type of  X  X  X rticle X  X . Then, all the searching results were downloaded to the local computer with full record in a  X  X  X ab delimited X  X  form provided by ISI databases.
To implement the computation, we compiled a computer program under the environment of Visual Stu-dio.NET, using Microsoft SQL Server 2000 as the supporting database. The linking relationships between scientific papers were established through analyzing one of the bibliographic items called  X  X  X ited reference X  X .
The extracted references were then matched up to the source papers item by item; those references, which had not find counterpart in the current dataset, would not be considered in the following calculation. Once the cited X  X iting relationships had been built up, a citation network came into existence.

A citation network is represented as heterogeneous, multi-relational papers, in which nodes are individual scientific papers and edges are citation links between them. In this study, the citation network is consisted of 236,517 nodes representing all articles published in 261 journals in the field of the  X  X  X iochemistry and Molec-ular Biology X  X  during the time period of 2000 X 2005, and 511,212 links representing the citations (references) produced by all these papers.
During the calculation, we started with a uniform PageRank value equal to 1 for all papers and then iter-ated in the database. The convergence condition of iterations was set down using the residual vector. Let PR be a vector of PageRanks of all papers at the i th iteration. For an intermediate vector PR ual i = PR i +1 PR i . We treated i Residual i i as an indicator for how well PR is expected to be less than exp  X  10 5 after an adequate number of iterations. Eventually, a steady state set of PageRanks, namely PR * , for all nodes of the network would be reached.

The damping factor d in the original study by Brin and Page (1998) was set as 0.85. This value was deter-mined by their observation that an individual surfer will typically follow an order of 6 hyperlinks, bringing to a stopping probability (1 d ) = 1/6 0.15. However, in Chen, Xie, Maslov, and Redner X  X  (2006) empirical study, it was found that scientific papers usually follow a shorter path of about average two links. Thus, we chose d = 0.5 to be our damping factor in the current citation network. Whatsoever, the value of damping factor d and its effect on the performance of PageRank algorithm still need further discussions in future studies. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. The introduction of  X  X  X nternal Citations X  X 
First, one should keep in mind the citations in the ISI databases are counted over all publications in a total of 105 subject categories; whereas we only made calculations for the subset of 261 journals included in  X  X  X io-chemistry and Molecular Biology X  X  during the time period of 2000 X 2005.

Due to the restricted range of seed journals and limited time period, we could not find the whole list of  X  X  X ited reference X  X  in the current dataset. According to the authors X  calculation, the citations collected in the current network represent 1/5 X 1/6 of all citations recorded in ISI databases for all these papers included.
In this respect, we brought forward a concept of Internal Citations, which represent the number of citations only by papers included in the limited seed journals and time period. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , where nodes are papers and arrows represent the citing X  X ited relationship, the statistic of citations increases with growing amount of publications indexed by the databases. We may clearly observe that, the  X  X  X SI Database Citations X  X  are actually kind of  X  X  X nternal Citations X  X  if compared with  X  X  X ll Citations X  X .
 4.2. The consistency between PageRanks and Internal Citations
To see how the PageRank algorithm performs, we may first take a look at the distributional characteristic of the PageRanks compared with the Internal Citations (see Fig. 2 ). Redner (1998) , studying the citation dis-tribution of 783,339 papers cataloged by ISI and 24,296 papers published in  X  X  Physical Review D  X  X  between 1975 and 1994, found that the probability a paper is cited k times follows a power law P ( k ) k nent c cite = 3. It indicates that the in-degree distribution of the citation network follows a power law. Another study by Va  X  zquez (2001) extended the study to the out-degree distribution as well, finding that it also has an exponential tail.

In the following part, we focus on the distribution of PageRanks, viz. the number of papers N ( k ) that are calculated to have a PageRank value of k . The figure is then produced on a semi-logarithmic scale. Instead of displaying all data points individually, we binned individual data points into separate groups, which can be a better guide to the eye, and the marker size was decided by the number of data points in the bins. It is indicated by Fig. 2 that the distribution of PageRanks has indeed the typical form of Power-Law as the data points basi-cally fit the estimated exponential curve. The overall PageRanks follows a distribution of N ( k ) k for c PR and 0.903 for R square . In this case, we infer that the PageRank is also a substitutive indicator, which can also reflect the scale-free characteristic in such complex network.

We then calculate Kendall X  X  s and Spearman X  X  q between the ranks of Internal Citations and PageRank value for each year during 2000 X 2005 (see Table 1 ) in order to test if there exists correlation relation-ship between them. The nonparametric correlations are adopted instead of the parametric correlation (Pearson X  X  c ) because the current data do not follow the Gaussian distributional assumption required by the
Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient. It is indicated in Table 1 that the two correlation coefficients have both reached about 0.9 at the 0.01 significant level (two-tailed), which suggests a highly correlated relationship between the PageRank and Internal Citations.

Given the above two points, the PageRank can be considered as a reliable indicator representing the impor-tance of scientific publication in such citation network, and is strongly correlated with the traditional indicator of Internal Citations. This observation ensures that the evaluation studies based on PageRank could never lead to perverse results. 4.3. The disparity between PageRanks and Internal Citations
As two different measures of importance, the distinctions between them should be studied. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, the average PageRank for each group of papers with k Internal Citations, namely PR ( k ) is calculated instead of individual PageRanks for each paper (see Fig. 3 ). It is indicated in Fig. 3 that the plot k gets larger.

Focused on the dispersed part in Fig. 3 , the top 10 highest ranking papers according to their PageRank values are listed in Table 2 , together with their ranks of Internal Citations and brief bibliographic information.
While most of the papers listed in Table 2 are highly cited papers, we can also find one modestly cited paper that is highly ranked in the PageRank. Smardon X  X  paper  X  X  X GO-1 is related to RNA-directed RNA polymer-ase and functions in germ-line development and RNA interference in C-elegans X  X , which deals with the RNA interference technique, is listed in the 7th highest ranking papers according to PageRank values, while it ranks 204 based on Internal Citations. We happened to notice that the two laureates of 2006 Nobel Prize in Phys-iology or Medicine have been awarded because of their contribution in RNA interference techniques, which is  X  X  X oincidentally X  X  similar to the topic of Smardon X  X  paper. We may believe that it is the potential important topic which lets Smardon X  X  paper receive much concern from academic authorities and thus become a valuable research effort; otherwise it would probably be ignored due to limited number of citations. In this sense, the
PageRank algorithm could identify several influential papers suffered from low citations, and furthermore make them visible to the research community.

In summary, we suggest that PageRank is a better indicator serving as a substitution of the number of cita-tions for measuring papers X  influence. On the one hand, it has high relevancy with the traditional citation mea-sures and will hardly lead to perverse results. On the other hand, it could incorporate the importance of citing papers to a specific cited paper, therefore excavating several important papers that may suffer from low citations.
 4.4. Exploratory analyses of scientific performance based on PageRank
It is previously mentioned in Section 1 that the PageRank algorithm is supposed to provide us an integrated picture of academic influence for the evaluation of national scientific performance. Thus, we are motivated to conduct the following analyses based on the calculated PageRank values and make further conclusions on the research status of individual countries. In addition, local reorder of countries with respect to the PageRank is discussed and compared with the rankings of citation counts.

According to authors X  calculation, there are altogether 144 countries contributed to the publication activity in the field  X  X  X iochemistry and Molecular Biology X  X  as reported in the current dataset. For the publications affiliated to more than one country, we assign 1 to each country uniformly and take them as the output of all the affiliated countries. In the present study, we concentrate on the top eight countries of the European Union 3 which together account for 90% of the world X  X  total publications in the field of  X  X  X iochemistry and Molecular Biology X  X .

Fig. 4 provides an overview of the publication contribution from the top eight productive countries as well as the European Union. In Fig. 4 , the sub-pie chart on the right hand is drawn from the  X  X  X U 25 X  X  part of the left-hand pie chart. The percentage in brackets denotes the ratio of each country X  X  publications to the world X  X  total. It indicates that USA is the second largest shareholder in terms of publications covered by  X  X  X iochem-istry and Molecular Biology X  X , while EU takes the leading position as a research union. Among all 25 member states of EU, the former 15 members take 93% of the EU X  X  total publications and 35% of the world X  X  total publications. It is indicated in the sub-pie chart that the United Kingdom, Germany and France do play a leading role in the European Union and even enter the top five on the world stage. The Asian countries, like
Japan, PR China, South Korea and India, are still active contributors as they always perform in many other scientific fields, such as computer science ( Guan &amp; Ma, 2004 ) and nanoscience and nanotechnology ( Zhou &amp; Leydesdoff, 2006 ), etc.

As a surrogate indication of scientific impact, the average PageRank values of scientific publications have been then calculated at the national level for all the above-mentioned countries, including: USA, Japan, Can-ada, PR China, South Korea, Australia, India, Russia and former 15 member states of EU, as well as the left 10 member states of EU represented by  X  X  X U 10 X  X  as one community. In the following part,  X  X  X esearch status X  X  is defined to depict the two-dimensional scientific performance, consisting of scientific productivity and aca-demic influence. And the two dimensions are separately measured by the number of publications and average PageRank values as illustrated in Fig. 5 .

The countries in Fig. 5 are represented by different shapes, e.g. hollow squares for the former 15 member states of EU, solid dots for the four Asian countries, and solid triangles for the other countries together with the left 10 member states of EU as a whole.

In Fig. 5 , USA can again be characterized by a preponderance of both scientific productivity and academic influence in the field of  X  X  X iochemistry and Molecular Biology X  X . Focused on the upper-left part where coun-tries do high-quality researches under a limited productivity level, there are altogether 11 out of former 15 member states of EU. This suggests that the European Union has provided its member states with a barrier-free platform on which they could easily communicate and thus improve their research level.
On the other hand, four Asian countries have all located in the lower-left part in Fig. 5 , which suggests a pessimistic research status with lower prestige and fewer publications. Actually, the research efforts in Asian countries have been suffering from the low international visibility, due to some rooted barriers of language, culture, communication channels, etc. In a sense, they are still peripheric countries toward the mainstream research community.
 Finally, a comparison between PageRank and Internal Citations is made on the national level. The items in Table 3 are sorted in an ascending order of the Rank of average PageRank values.

According to Table 3 , Luxembourg has remarkably high influence in  X  X  X iochemistry and Molecular Biol-ogy X  X  as reflected by the average PageRank value. Regarding its few publications, the research quality of Lux-embourg is extraordinarily high compared with most other countries. Focusing on the distinction between two indicators, one may find the ranking of countries based on PageRank has reordered compared with that of average Internal Citations. For countries that rank higher on the PageRank than on Internal Citations, like Luxemburg, Sweden, etc., we may suggest that these countries are potentially influential in this specific field. For the countries that rank lower on the PageRank than on Internal Citations, like Denmark, Canada,
France, etc., their importance might be slightly overestimated by the citation counts for their research publi-cations are not adequately cited by influential papers.

However, we should always keep in mind the PageRank indicator and its corresponding citation network in the current study was established on the basis of a specific field during a limited time period. The result must be local and field-specific. Yet we may expect that the PageRank indicator will be more universalized with expanded data source and long stretching time period. 5. Concluding remarks The present study attempts to measure the importance of scientific publications from another perspective.
The PageRank algorithm provides a meaningful extension to the traditionally used number of citations for individual papers or aggregation of papers at different levels.

The citation network of scientific publications is an important resource that would provide additional infor-mation compared to the traditional citation analysis. The PageRank is an objective measure of its citation importance that corresponds well with people X  X  subjective idea of importance. Because of this correspondence,
PageRank is an excellent way to prioritize the influence of research papers suffering from relatively lower cita-tions, therefore excavating the potential influence of scientific publications.

The evidence from national comparison of scientific performance in the field of  X  X  X iochemistry and Molec-ular Biology X  X  shows that US always plays the leading role in both publication productivity and academic influence during 2000 X 2005. Eleven countries out of the former 15 member states of European Union have been conducting high quality scientific researches at a relatively lower level of production. By comparison, the research influences of Asian countries have been much lower when their scientific productivity remains low either.

A meaningful advantage of PageRank is that it could largely eliminate the flattery of academic influence caused by author self-citations. Nowadays, while the ISI databases could automatically filter out self-citations from total citation counts, bibliometricians are able to easily operate the citation analysis in a  X  X  X elf-citation-free X  X  environment. However, it is somewhat reckless to completely ignore the effect of author self-citations, as there probably are some thoughtful considerations and instructive nexus when authors cite their previous works. In this case, the PageRank algorithm treats the author self-citations with more consciousness. The
PageRank contribution of a author X  X  paper T i to his own paper A could be strongly diluted if the papers ( T ) neither are important (large PR ( T i )) nor have a short list of references (small C ( T self-citation links bearing valuable academic relationships would still contribute a significant part to the rank-ing of an author X  X  own cited paper.

However, the robustness of PageRank algorithm with respect to the free parameter d is still under discus-sion. As previously mentioned, we choose d = 0.5 based on Chen X  X  empirical study that most scientists nor-mally follow an order of 2 citation links in a citation network. Besides, we also have calculated the
PageRank values on different situations of damping factor d . For d = 0.85, as it was in the original Google algorithm, some local changes have been observed for those highly ranked papers when d = 0.5. According to our statistics, all the top 10 PageRank papers calculated under d = 0.5 have remained in the top 35 Page-
Rank papers when d = 0.85. In other words, there is little global reordering of papers when the damping factor d changes from 0.5 to 0.85. Thus, we may conclude that PageRank indicator is a robust measurement repre-senting the academic influence of scientific papers.
