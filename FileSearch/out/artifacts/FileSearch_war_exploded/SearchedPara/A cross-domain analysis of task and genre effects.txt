 1. Introduction
The relationship between searchers X  information needs and documents in the collection is at the heart of information re-trieval (IR). Although topical relevance has been the primary basis for matching needs to documents, the importance of sit-uational and task-based criteria, which influence the usefulness of documents in particular contexts and situations, have long been acknowledged ( Borlund, 2003a; Cooper, 1971 ). These criteria are fundamental to conceptions of Interactive IR ( Ruthven, 2008 ) and Human Computer Information Retrieval (HCIR) ( Marchionini, 2006 ). This paper contributes to our understanding of situational criteria by focusing on the pragmatic relationship between two factors: document genres and searchers X  information tasks. Genres are recognizable types of information objects differentiated through aspects of form, content and communicative function. They are naturally-occurring features of written communication and are preva-lent in most large document collections. Reports, guides and newsletters are examples of common document genres. Infor-mation tasks are activities focused on finding information to serve particular purposes. This research focuses on a set of generic information task types: learning, fact-finding, doing, making a decision, and solving a problem. Two studies in dif-ferent domains that examine the effect of variations in task type and document genre on the perceived usefulness of docu-ments are presented and compared.

This research topic is important because search systems still do a poor job of identifying information that is useful, i.e. capable of supporting the tasks and goals of searchers. In most search systems, the searcher is required to manually sift through large sets of results that are  X  X  X bout X  X  the query, in order to find those that are appropriate to their needs.
While considerable research attention has been directed at improving interaction paradigms and the display of search results to support searchers in the assessment and selection process, there is still a need for robust, task-based models to predict document usefulness. The task X  X enre relationship is potentially valuable in this respect, because it has both common-sense validity and a logical basis in functional genre theory. However, more empirical research is needed to  X  determine the nature and extent of the task X  X enre relationship as it pertains to information retrieval. A number of studies have shown that document selection in the search process is influenced by genre ( Freund, 2011; Freund &amp; and usefulness.

One of the challenging aspects of this approach is that task and genre repertoires vary across domains and information environments. Much of the foundational work studying genres of communication has been done in organizational settings, paper is to determine the extent to which patterns of task X  X enre relationships are domain specific or generalizable across domains. Clearer articulation of these boundaries will facilitate the development and application of robust theory and meth-ods in the design of search systems.
 2005 ) by focusing specifically on the task X  X enre-usefulness relationship across two domains. The jfirst study reported here was conducted in an enterprise setting via a questionnaire with a population of software services consultants. The second study is an experimental user study focused on e-government content: an Internet domain that shares some features of the enterprise but is used by a much broader community. The paper is structured as follows. The introduction is followed by a background section containing a description of the conceptual framework for this work and a review of prior research.
The methods and results of each of the two studies are presented separately, followed by a common discussion and some brief conclusions. 2. Background 2.1. Conceptual framework
The general conceptual framework for this work is contextual IR, an ecological approach that seeks to identify the nature and impact of the many factors that influence the IR interaction. Calls for contextual IR have been put forward by Sparck-
Jones (2006) and Ingwersen and J X rvelin (2005) among others. The intent of contextual IR is to develop models of context that can be employed in IR systems to enhance retrieval performance. The two contextual factors examined in this paper are information tasks and document genres. 2.1.1. Tasks in HCIR
A task can be described as  X  X  X n activity to be performed in order to accomplish a goal X  X  ( Vakkari, 2003 ). Human activ-ities in the workplace and in everyday life are often, although not always, goal directed, and it is widely recognized that such activities often prompt information seeking behavior. Proposals to re-conceptualize IR as a task-based activity have been made by Vakkari (2003) and others (e.g. J X rvelin, 1986; Reid, 2000 ). With respect to HCIR, which brings together perspectives from Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Behavior (IB) and IR, it is useful to consider tasks at a number of levels, including: work tasks, information tasks, search tasks, and system interaction tasks. A number of useful reviews discuss these task hierarchies and typologies in more detail ( Bystr X m &amp; Hansen, 2005; Toms, 2011; Vakkari, 2003 ).

Work tasks are particular cases of tasks, in which there is an assigned activity or unit of work that needs to be completed in order to meet a pre-defined goal, usually having some extrinsic value. The work task provides the  X  X  X mbedding task X  X  ( Hansen, 2005; Pirolli, 2007 ): the environment in which search tasks are conducted and which establishes the criteria for evaluating outcomes, including relevance assessments ( Borlund, 2003b ). Work tasks have been analyzed from multiple of the most commonly studied characteristics are complexity and stage. Much of this work has been reviewed extensively elsewhere ( Toms, 2011; Vakkari, 2003 ).

The primary focus of this paper is at the level of information tasks, which are less commonly differentiated from work and search tasks. There is no agreed-upon nomenclature or typology of information tasks. Allen X  X  (1996) book entitled Informa-learning and planning. Other common types of information tasks (often referred to as search tasks) used in studies of search behavior are based upon the type of information sought: known item searches, subject or topical searches, fact finding, and question X  X nswering ( Hsieh-Yee, 2001 ). In this research, information task types are defined based on the user X  X  intended use doing, making a decision, and solving a problem. While these tasks may prompt searching, in all but the case of fact-finding they cannot be resolved simply by finding information, and thus they are distinct from search tasks. Information tasks are motivated and framed by work tasks.
 2.1.2. Functional genre theory
The concept of literary genre has been used as a means of classifying texts since ancient times; however, a functional approach to genre has developed over the past several decades that views genres as social and communicative actions actions characterized by similar substance and form and taken in response to recurrent situations X  X  ( Yates &amp; Orlikowski, genres are organic, rather than manufactured forms:  X  X  X hey emerge from cultural-historical activity and represent, reflect, of context; they represent elements of the  X  X  X ho, what, where, when, why and how X  X  of a document, which makes them par-2001 ).

Like work tasks, genres are a domain-specific phenomenon, as  X  X  X ifferent disciplines or discourse communities develop special kinds of documents as adaptations to their special needs X  X  ( Hjorland, 2002, p. 437 ). The genre sets in common usage
Genre repertoires serve to promote mutual understanding and make documents recognizable among members of groups documents ( Toms, 2001; Vaughan &amp; Dillon, 2006 ).

Functional genre theory has underpinnings in pragmatics, the branch of linguistics concerned with language usage and the meaning that is derived from the relationships between language, its users and the context of use ( Levinson, 1983 ). A key claim of pragmatics is that human communication is a social undertaking based on a shared intent to communicate cooperatively ( Clark, 1996; Tomasello, 2008 ). In this sense, document genres serve important pragmatic functions. Unger (2002) argues that genres develop initially as cognitive pragmatic phenomena designed to support particular communica-ate and use specific genres for particular purposes and in certain situations, they became established as socio-pragmatic phenomena. Following Sperber and Wilson (1995) , it is reasonable to claim that genre increases relevance, because it helps to make explicit how the document is meant to be used, and familiar styles and features help users process the information with less cognitive effort ( Vaughan &amp; Dillon, 2006 ). 2.1.3. Summary
Tasks and genres constitute important components of HCIR, the former motivating and establishing criteria for the search and the latter communicating the purpose and context of the documents in the collection. On this basis, it is reasonable to assume that a relationship exists between task and genre, in which searchers use genre to assess the usefulness of docu-ments to particular tasks. 2.2. Literature review
While there is a sound theoretical basis for the relationship between tasks and genres, there is little empirical evidence to support or characterize this relationship. Most of the related literature consists of general studies of document assessment, studies of task and genre conducted separately, and a small number of studies that deal with both. 2.2.1. Document assessment Numerous studies have been conducted to examine how people select documents and assess relevance (e.g. Barry, 1994;
Park, 1993; Schamber, 1991 ). These studies have identified many relevance criteria that relate to characteristics of docu-ments and aspects of the searcher and the situation. A meta-ethnography of sixteen relevance studies identified 133 such assessments and genre has not emerged as an important criterion. This may be the result of a lack of task and genre diversity in the document collections used, as many of the studies pre-date the World Wide Web (WWW). One exception is the re-2012 ). 2.2.2. Task effects on information behavior The influence of tasks on information behavior is widely recognized and has been represented in key models of IB (e.g. of information behavior, including the information sought, the search tactics used and relevance judgements. A number of studies conducted since (e.g. Lykke Nielsen, 2001; Serola, 2006 ) have found that different types of work tasks prompt with few definitive results ( Hansen, 2005 ).

Studies of information/search tasks have found similar effects. Limberg (1999) compared the research behavior of stu-pic) and found that depending on the task, participants handled and evaluated information differently with respect to a number of parameters, including relevance, bias, information quantity and authority. A study by Toms and colleagues information gathering and decision-making). They found that the number of search queries used for fact-finding and deci-sion making were higher, information gathering queries were longer, and fewer pages were examined for fact-finding tasks. A small number of studies have focused on the effect of tasks on relevance assessments. Using the same search tasks as
Toms et al. (2008) and Larsen et al. (2008) conducted an analysis of graded usefulness assessments carried out in the con-and colleagues (2005) used three types of search tasks (background, decision making and collecting) and found that assess-ments based on content, layout and authority features were quite evenly distributed across the three tasks, but other fea-tures seemed to be associated with certain tasks. For example, links were mentioned more frequently for the information collecting task and the background task. Taking a different approach to a similar question, two studies were conducted to compare the frequency of HTML features in documents assessed as relevant and non-relevant for two types of search tasks: ings showed task effects for some elements, such as contact information, forms and tables. 2.2.3. Genre effects
In contrast, far fewer studies have been conducted on the effect of genre on information behavior, although interest is growing. Genre has been recognized as a possible means of supporting more targeted IR through automatic identification of genres on the Web ( Karlgren, 1999; Roussinov et al., 2001; Stein et al., 2011 ). An early genre analysis of a sample of 837 web pages found 48 different genres represented ( Crowston, &amp; Williams, 2000 ). Rosso (2008) was interested in estab-lishing a set of well-recognized genres to support web retrieval in the education domain. Using card sorting and naming studies, he identified a taxonomy of 18 commonly recognized genre categories and labels. Further testing in which partic-ipants were asked to classify a set of documents according to the taxonomy achieved over 70% agreement among study par-ticipants, suggesting that usable taxonomies of web genres can be created in particular domains.
 Some experimental search systems that make use of genre have been proposed or developed ( Bretan, Dewe, Hallberg, search results by genre, which assumes that searchers are able to specify their preferred genres while searching. This is a tenuous assumption given what is known about the anomalous state of human information needs ( Belkin, 1980 ). At this point in time, most of the research on genre-enabled search systems is focused on the problem of automatic classification (e.g. Kushmerick &amp; Finn, 2006; Santini, 2011; Sharoff, 2011 ) rather than the design of such systems or studies of human interaction with them. 2.2.4. Task X  X enre effects
Studies of the interaction between task and genre in information behavior are rare. Vakkari and colleagues conducted a on document genre per se , these studies, conducted in the academic domain, identified categories such as background infor-mation, theories and models, cases, and empirical results. An early study in the Web context ( Roussinov et al., 2001 ) also identified task X  X enre relationships. Interviews were conducted with 184 participants who were using the Internet to search ful genres. Web pages actually retrieved from the Internet were collected and these were assessed by participants who char-acterized their genre as well as their relevance and utility. The study found that certain genres tended to be chosen as relevant for particular types of searches, using a mixed set of functional and topical search types such as news, shopping, health and job hunting. The broader IR research community has focused some attention on the relationships between genre and search task types through the High Accuracy Retrieval of Documents (HARD) track of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC), but study results of this relatively short-lived track were not definitive ( He &amp; Demner-Fushman, 2003; Muresan, Smith, Cole, Liu, &amp; Belkin, 2006 ).

Some related work has been done in the two domains of interest here: e-government and software engineering. In e-government, the life-events portal is a popular approach to organizing content for the public in which information is clustered by key events such as marriage, death and graduation ( Vintnar &amp; Leben, 2002 ). These life events are analogous to work tasks that provide the motivation and context for information searching. Haraldsen, Stray, P X iv X rinta, and Sein (2004) built upon this concept by studying the genres of communication used in exchanges between the government and the public in the context of the life event of  X  X  X uilding a house X  X  and then used the genres to derive system requirements for a life-events portal. The study concluded that genre analysis can help bridge the gap between technological and social aspects of designing e-government systems. In the software engineering domain, two earlier studies by the author established the groundwork for the study reported here. In the first, interviews with software engineering consultants revealed that the types of tasks in which they are engaged influence the characteristics of information sought and the search strategies employed. One of the key strategies reported was to seek familiar document genres that were known to have the desired characteristics ( Freund, 2011 ). A follow-up study with the same population ( Freund et al., 2005 ) examined the relationship between tasks and genres in a large, shared document repository. Analysis of the task and genre metadata in this repository supported the hypothesis of a relationship between these factors. Related work in the software engineering domain used browser log analysis and interviews to identify and qualitatively describe a large genre repertoire and associations with a four broad information uses: no defined purpose (curiosity or fun), for orientation; to get directions up on these findings by quantitatively validating the existence of task X  X enre relationships in both domains using a set of defined task types. 2.2.5. Summary
The growing literature on tasks shows a wide range of task effects on search behavior, although there are few discernible studies. A small number of studies indicate that a relationship exists between task and genre, but these findings are preli-minary and require validation. Much of the IR research related to genre has focused on the problem of classification, rather than testing the concept of genre-enabled search. 3. Research questions
The main intent of the two studies presented here was to test the assumption that a relationship exists between task and genre with respect to document assessment. Of secondary interest were the existence of separate task and genre effects on usefulness, and the possible confounding influence of domain and expertise. The following research questions guided the studies: Do variations in information task types and document genres affect the perceived usefulness of documents? Does expertise influence perceptions of usefulness across tasks and genres?
Are task and genre effects on usefulness consistent across domains? 4. Study One: software services workplace
The potential value of examining task and genre effects in information retrieval first emerged over the course of a multi-phase research project on workplace information behavior. The research setting was a large high-tech company, among a population of software services consultants. Most of the consultants have educational backgrounds in computer science or software engineering and their work activities are centred on providing expert assistance and guidance to industrial and commercial clients in implementing software systems and solving technical problems. They are reliant upon informa-tion to do their work, and are heavy users of information in digital formats.

The information environment of the research site and population is characteristic of many large organizations. It contains a rich store of heterogeneous types of information related to the technologies and products in the company X  X  purview that is distributed across the Internet, an enterprise-level intranet, internal databases and the computers of individual employees.
Many of the documents used by the study population are created by and for their colleagues, and expertise in finding and using this information is considered to be a valuable professional skill.

The first two phases of the study, which have been published elsewhere, provided evidence of a relationship between task ings by exploring the relationships between specific tasks and genres. 4.1. Methods
The study was conducted through a web-based questionnaire posted on the corporate intranet. The questionnaire elicited participants X  perceptions of task characteristics and usefulness with respect to repertoires of tasks and genres common in this domain. 4.1.1. Task and genre repertoires
Lists of common work and information tasks were compiled and refined during interviews with participants. The guiding design principles were that the task repertoires should reflect the study population X  X  understanding of their work practices and provide an easy means of identifying the tasks associated with diverse search situations. The final set of information tasks includes five types. Table 1 listed the information tasks together with the definitions used in the questionnaire. large portion of the documents in heavy use by this group. In order to preserve the domain-specific and situated nature of genre use and of existing task X  X enre relationships, a bottom-up classification approach was used, based on a study of the current information environment and commonly used genres. A list of all the genres mentioned by participants in interviews conducted in early phases of the research was compiled and compared with six sets of genres used to classify documents in only one source. This set was reduced to a smaller and more functional repertoire by selecting the most prevalent and spe-cific genres. More details on the process of determining the genre taxonomy are provided in a separate publication ( Freund,
Clarke, &amp; Toms, 2006 ). Table 2 presents the final set of 17 genres together with brief definitions. 4.1.2. Instruments and procedures
A questionnaire was designed to collect data on participants X  information behavior, including their perceptions of these demographics (age, gender, and expertise), information source preferences, work task characteristics, and perceptions of usefulness. The survey was reviewed by several members of the study population and revised to ensure that the terminology was clear and appropriate.

The analysis here will focus on the final question, which asked participants to rate the usefulness of the 17 genres in the of information on a scale of 1 X 5 to indicate likely usefulness. X  X  4.1.3. Participants and recruitment
Recruitment was a serious challenge due to the highly specialized skills and knowledge of this population, and their demanding work schedules. The questionnaire was posted for a period of three weeks on the corporate intranet. To encour-age participation, the study was presented through an open conference call to the entire consulting group. However, most participants were eventually recruited via direct email solicitation by colleagues and managers. Participants who completed the survey were offered the chance to enter a draw for a small gift.
 The final sample of convenience consisted of 20 software services consultants working out of offices located in North
America and Europe. Participants X  ages ranged fairly evenly from 26 to 55, with one participant older than 55. Only two of the 20 were women; however this gender skew is representative of the population more generally. All but one participant held university degrees, of which eight were at the graduate level. The degrees represent a range of disciplines: computer were skilled consultants ranging from seniority levels seven to ten (the highest level), they had on average just over seven years of experience in their current work. 4.1.4. Data analysis
Data was collected into a DB2 database from the Web questionnaire and exported into SPSS when the study was com-plete. Participants were grouped into two levels of expertise based on seniority level. A univariate General Linear Model tion, separate ANOVAs were conducted to assess the genre effect within each information task. 4.2. Results tial eta squared values, indicate that task and expertise effects on usefulness are small, at less than 3%; however the genre (14%) and the task X  X enre interaction (13%) effect sizes are more substantial.

Fig. 1 shows a plot of the unweighted mean usefulness scores assigned by junior and senior level participants for the five information tasks. The graph demonstrates that participants with higher expertise tended to assign lower usefulness scores considered to be a relatively simple information task.

The results of post hoc ANOVAs conducted to investigate the task X  X enre interaction effect ( Table 4 ) show that usefulness scores and usefulness scores above 3.5 are bolded. The highest scoring genre for each task is marked with an asterisk.
Overall, mean usefulness scores vary from 2.05 at the lowest (demos for problem solving) to 4.74 at the highest (product ing (2.80 X 4.30). Table 4 shows some interesting patterns in task X  X enre relations. The top five genres listed emerge as the core genres of communication within this community, as they are considered highly useful across all or most of these tasks.
Even among these, there is considerable variation in the scores by task. Lower down in the table are genres that have con-ditional value: they are considered highly useful for select tasks only. Only one genre in this set (method documents) has no pose: product documents are reference materials designed for looking up facts, technotes describe bugs and fixes to support problem solving, best practices documents offer evidence-based guidelines to support decision-making, cookbooks contain step-by-step instructions to support procedural tasks, and manuals are in-depth materials designed to support self-directed learning. 4.3. Summary
The results of the first study, conducted in an enterprise setting among a community of software engineering pro-fessionals, provide evidence of a strong tripartite relationship between task, genre and usefulness. Variations in genre and the interaction between task and genre have the strongest effects on perceived usefulness, but task and expertise effects are also significant. Usefulness scores vary significantly across genres for all five information tasks (learning, doing, fact-finding, deciding and problem-solving) and certain genres clearly emerge as more useful for certain tasks and overall. 5. Study Two: e-government on the Web
The second study used the same set of information tasks as Study One, but was conducted in a Web-based domain. E-gov-ernment was selected because it is similar enough to the enterprise context to provide a good basis for comparison, but in-cludes a much broader segment of the population. E-government consists of a relatively well-defined and well-structured
Internet information environment, which contains heterogeneous and genred content. In the Canadian Federal context, which is the focus of this study, a genre taxonomy already exists as one component of the metadata infrastructure ( Treasury
Board of Canada, 2003 ). As in the workplace, searches for e-government information tend to be serious and goal-directed, but in contrast, the level of domain and task expertise of the searchers is much lower, as most members of the public interact with government information only occasionally. So, while it is expected that information tasks and genres play some role in information behavior in this domain, the searchers X  lack of expertise and familiarity may limit the task and genre effects on perceptions of usefulness.
 5.1. Methods
Data collection was carried out through an experimental user study with 25 participants and a set of 160 documents re-trieved from the Canadian Federal government Web domain (gc.ca). Participants completed five document assessment tasks, each of which consisted of assessing the usefulness of eight documents for each of five situated work task scenarios. Each of the 160 documents used in the study was assessed by at least five participants. 5.1.1. Task and genre repertoires
In order to establish a more naturalistic assessment framework, 20 Situated Work Task Scenarios ( Borlund, 2003b ) were designed around everyday health and environmental information needs. Four scenarios were created for each of five infor-mation task types. 2 The corpus of documents for assessment was gathered by designing simple keyword queries to represent each scenario and submitting these to Google, restricted to the Canadian government domain. From each set of 20 top-ranked genres in the corpus was not balanced, but rather reflects the natural genre variation in search results.

The genre repertoire for this domain was drawn from the Government of Canada Document Type Schema, which con-tains a list of 50 genres in common use in the e-government domain ( Treasury Board of Canada, 2003 ). Prior to conducting the study, each document was classified separately by the author and a research assistant according to this Schema. Initial agreement was low, but through an iterative process of refining the classification rules and adjudicating disagreements, each document was assigned to a single, primary genre category. 27 different genres were identified among the set of 160 documents, with the 9 most prevalent genres making up 76% of the total. Labels and definitions for these are pre-sented in Table 5 . 5.1.2. Instruments and procedures
The study was hosted online and self-guided, but was conducted in the controlled environment of a computer lab. It con-exit questionnaire. Participants were shown to workstations, given an overview of the experiment and instructed to quickly assess the documents as they normally would when conducting a search for information. Participants were asked to com-plete assessments for five scenarios, which were rotated to distribute the scenarios and task types evenly among participants and to compensate for order effects. For each document assessed, participants were asked to respond to the following questions: How useful do you think this document would be for this scenario? (1 = Not at all useful to 7 = Very useful). How did you decide what score to assign this document? (Open).
 Which of the following document type labels, if any, apply to this document (A list of ten common genres was provided). What would you call this type of document in your own words? (Open).

The post-scenario questionnaire asked participants to rate the realism and difficulty of the scenario, and the value of the rate how difficult they found it to assess documents and to explain their assessments, and to identify challenges they expe-rienced in the assessment task.
 5.1.3. Participants and recruitment
Participants were a convenience sample recruited from a university campus community using flyers and listservs, con-sisting of 25 adults, fluent in English and long-term residents of Canada. These sample limitations were necessary to ensure some familiarity with Canadian government genres of communication, which would be lacking in a sample drawn from
Internet users in general. The 14 male and 11 female participants ranged in age from 22 to over 50, with the majority be-tween 22 and 25 years of age. Most were undergraduate ( n = 12) and graduate ( n = 8) students representing a wide range of the Internet, but relatively infrequent searchers for government information. 5.1.4. Data analysis
Data was collected into an SQL database from the online questionnaire and quantitative data was exported into SPSS when the study was complete. A univariate GLM analysis was conducted to test for the effect of two factors: task and genre, on usefulness scores. The analysis considered the nine most prevalent document genres as identified by the expert assess-ment. Separate, post hoc ANOVAs were conducted to assess the genre effect within each information task. Qualitative re-sponses were analyzed using content analysis and cross tabulation of code frequencies. 5.2. Results Results of the GLM analysis indicate that there are significant differences in usefulness scores for both task stricted to three of the five tasks: deciding, doing, and learning.

Table 6 lists the number ( N ) of assessments available for each genre as well as the mean scores by task, by genre, and by the combination of the two. Given the unbalanced nature of this corpus, data was not available for all task X  X enre combina-The highest scoring genres are marked with an asterisk.

Some patterns emerge here. In contrast to the previous study, the highest mean usefulness scores here are assigned to documents for fact-finding tasks, and the lowest for problem solving, which are the two tasks that show no significant var-iation across genres. Across all tasks, news publications and reference materials emerged as less useful and guides and home-fact sheets for deciding and educational materials for learning.

To delve further into the role of genre in assessing documents, participants X  explanations of their usefulness scores were analyzed. A coding scheme was developed, based on simple content analysis of these brief comments, with six main types of assessment criteria identified: Topical : relates to the subject matter, scope and depth.
 Situational : relates to suitability with respect to the scenario.
 Purpose : relates to the purpose, intent or genre of the document.
 Presentation : relates to the design and navigation features.
 Quantity : relates to the amount of information.
 Quality : relates to authority, accuracy, etc. of the information.

Comments in the Purpose category serve to illuminate the relationship between genre and usefulness. Overall, about one third of participants X  833 comments included some mention of purpose, and purpose criteria made up about 19% of all the criteria mentioned, as multiple codes were applied to each comment. Cross tabulation analysis of the frequency with which purpose criteria were mentioned showed significant variation, both across levels of usefulness ( v frequently for doing tasks, and for documents assessed in the mid-range of usefulness. In contrast, Topical comments are most often mentioned at the low and high ends of the usefulness scale, and presentation characteristics steadily increase in frequency from the low to the high end.

The predominance of purpose characteristics in the mid-range of usefulness can be explained by the many comments in forward, and if I was just looking for a quick summary of facts, I would have been impressed  X  X  (P12). 5.3. Summary
The results of the second study, conducted in the Web-based e-government domain, provide further evidence for task and genre effects on usefulness, although the effects are less robust than in Study One. Genre variation emerges as important or very few useful documents. Certain genres emerge as more and less useful overall, and for certain tasks. 6. Discussion
Results of this study provide evidence that perceptions of document usefulness are influenced by task, by genre, and by task X  X enre relationships within professional work settings and in less cohesive Internet domains. Using the same set of gen-eric information tasks in both studies provides a basis for cross-domain comparison that reveals similar patterns as well as some important differences in the effects of these contextual variables. 6.1. Task effects
The effect of task on usefulness scores is somewhat contradictory in the two studies. In both cases, usefulness scores vary highest in Study Two. One possible explanation is that typical fact-finding tasks may be more difficult in the software engi-neering domain, which is a highly technical and detail-oriented field. Differences in the design of the two studies may also mation tasks are supported by common document genres varies, which may represent one aspect of task difficulty in HCIR.
Learning tasks seem to be well-supported by a wide range of common genres in both domains, which makes it easier to find useful documents and may also encourage the wide-ranging browsing behaviors associated with exploratory search. Prob-worth considering that problem solving tasks are poorly served by static documents in general, and that interactive and dy-namic genres of communication may provide more benefit. 6.2. Expertise effects
In addition to task and genre, Study One tested for an effect of expertise on usefulness assessments, based on the assump-tion that domain expertise would result in greater familiarity with genres and their uses, and thus different perceptions of fects. This supports the conclusion that task X  X enre relationships are well-known and consistent within this professional community. There are a number of possible explanations for the observed negative effect of expertise on usefulness scores. sources, but there may also be an effect of the work performed by senior consultants, who normally perform tasks that are more challenging, and thus they may perceive the same resources as being proportionately less useful. 6.3. Genre and task X  X enre effects
Genre repertoires are necessarily domain-specific, as they reflect the particular nature of activities and discourses within communities. However, there are patterns in genre use and effects that extend across domains. These results indicate that the effect of genre on usefulness scores is stronger than the task effect. In both studies, certain genres emerged as more or community in general. These high value genres likely reflect the dominant information needs and patterns of communica-tion in the domain. They may be more mature genres, which have existed for some time, are relatively formalized and are finely tuned to the needs of the community. This is certainly true of the core genres identified in the software engineering domain, but is less clear in the e-government domain, where the genre repertoire is less specialized. There are also some genres that carry less value within repertoires, such as methods documents for software consultants, which may be consid-ered peripheral to the information needs of the community. Systems may consider differentiating between high and low va-lue genres within domains.
 not involved in the activities and discourses of e-government to the same extent that software consultants are involved in for which an effect was not observed, problem solving and fact finding, have, respectively, the lowest and highest mean use-to make use of genre to complete their tasks, and when searching is very difficult, genre does not add enough value to make a difference. This is supported by prior research showing that searchers use a larger number and wider variety of document types when engaged in more complex information seeking tasks such as problem solving ( Bystr X m &amp; J X rvelin, 1995 ). How-neering that is supported by a number of genres, but is not as common in e-government, and fact-finding tasks produced quite different results in the two studies, suggesting the existence of confounding factors.

It seems clear that the relationship between information tasks and genres is based primarily on functional matching. For example, manuals and educational materials, which are designed to teach something, are useful for someone with the infor-mation task of learning. This connection is very clear in both these studies, which found that for each information task, the genre that received the highest mean usefulness score was aligned in purpose with the task. There are also other types of relationships, based more on the form and content of genres, but purpose seems to be the strongest link. This reinforces the value of taking a functional approach to document genres and adds strength to Vakkari X  X  (2003) claim that functional and task-based matching can supplement topical approaches to IR. 6.4. Implications for HCIR systems
These results suggest that task and genre enabled search systems have the potential to increase searchers X  chances to ac-cess useful content when interacting with large document collections for a range of purposes. This approach resonates with a number of the desiderata for HCIR systems identified by Marchionini (2006) . He emphasized that HCIR systems should bring users closer to the information, give them greater opportunity for  X  X  X aking meaning X  X  with documents, and offer more scope and be part of a person X  X   X  X  X nformation ecology. X  X  Taking tasks and genres into account in the design of search systems auto-matically places more emphasis on interaction over retrieval, as the task X  X enre relationship is functional: it is grounded in the application and use of content. This approach offers an activity-centric and contextualized framework for modeling IR interactions, which comes closer to the ecological perspective sought by Marchionini (2006) and others ( Ingwersen &amp;
J X rvelin, 2005; Sparck-Jones, 2006 ). Allowing searchers to articulate their task context affords them a greater role and responsibility in the search process and identifying appropriate genres supports meaning making, as genres use conventions build upon the relationships between tasks, genres and perceptions of usefulness that are identified in this paper.
There are any numbers of ways in which systems may take account of these relationships, and it is not the purpose of this tionships between them may be established from evidence a priori or learned through usage over time. Relationships may be incorporated into the back-end through changes to the ranking algorithms, or in the front-end through signaling and filtering options within the interaction paradigm. Alongside the many implementation options, there are a number of challenges to developing genre-enabled search systems. The variability of genre and task repertoires and task X  X enre relationships means that specific relationships need to be derived within each domain, although general frameworks may function across do-mains. At the level of information task, at least, there does seem to be some consistency across domains, so developing this genre classification. Considerable progress has already been made on this problem, and it is reasonable to expect that large collections of classified Web documents will be available to researchers in the near future. Once these are available, future research can focus on assessing the contribution that task X  X enre relationships can make to real-world systems. 7. Conclusion
This paper has examined the relationship between task, genre and usefulness in HCIR through two studies in different domains, with the following results:
Searchers X  tasks, the genre of documents, and the relationships between tasks and genres was shown to influence percep-tions of usefulness.
 These general effects are consistent across the organizational and Web domains that were the foci of these studies.
In the organizational domain, expertise proved to have a negative effect on usefulness scores, but the variations in use-fulness scores caused by task and genre were not affected by expertise level.

This work provides a foundation for making use of task and genre relations as one aspect of context that plays an impor-experimental research design. Further research using more naturalistic methods is needed to resolve a number of open ques-tions identified through these studies.
