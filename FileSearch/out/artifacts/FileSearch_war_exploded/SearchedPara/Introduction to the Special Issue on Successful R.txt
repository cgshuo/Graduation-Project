 Since its inception, the field of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery from Databases has been driven by the need to solve practical problems [4]. From s caling to large databases and handling noisy and high-dimensiona l data to finding associational patterns in grocery store transaction data, data mining is a research area rich in application [1]. Despite its practical roots few case studies of data mining a pplications have been published. The industrial track of the annual SIGKDD conference has provided one such forum, but rarely do these papers present complete descriptions of deployed systems [2]. This special issue attempts to address the gap by showcasing the choices, strategies, and lessons learned from building a real-world data mining application. In a sense this coll ection is a follow-up to the first workshop on data mining case studies held during ICDM-2006 [3]. This issue however introduces several new papers. Of the 29 papers reviewed 1 0 papers were accepted. The papers come from a broad range of application areas including Customer Relationship Management, Medici ne, Taxation, and Software Development. Data mining is today applied in a panoply of successful applications from business, marke ting. medical research, financial securities, astronomy, surveillance, and even sports, to name a few. The papers in this special issue by no means represent all application domains. However the papers herein give a glimpse on current usage of data mining t echnology in real world systems. telecommunication data, consumer transactions, content of web pages, and software source code. These international papers give evidence of data mining utilized in a diverse and interesting range of successful applications and share experiences in surmounting hurdles when implementing and deploying real systems. The papers are not organized in any particular order as they pertain to distinct areas and techniques. In " Data Mining for Improved Cardiac Care " R. B. Rao, S. Krishnan and R. S. Niculescu pr esent a wonderful application of data mining to the improvement of quality of care and healthcare cost reduction surrounding cardiovascular disease. The application described is noteworthy because it appears to have saved lives. On a practical note th e paper presents a novel use of external domain knowledge to work around the often encountered problem of incomplete and noisy data. R. Bharat Rao received first place in the 2005 Data Mining Case Studies Practice Prize for his diligent work in this area. In " Closing the Gap: Automated Screening of Tax Returns to Identify Egregious Tax Shelters " DeBarr and Eyler-Walker describe the implementation of a da ta mining system in use at the Internal Revenue Service that id entifies high-income individuals engaging in abusive tax she lters. The implementation has uncovered hundreds of millions of dollars in sheltered revenue, including elaborate sheltering operations. DeBarr and Eyler-Walker were second place winners in the recent 2005 Data Mining Case Studies Practice Prize. In " Blocking Objectionable Web Content by Leveraging Multiple Information Source " Agarwal, Liu, and Zhang address the prevalent problem of identifying websites with objectionable content such as pornography. The paper presents an extended representation of the informati on encoded and related to a web page in order to improve cla ssification and demonstrate its performance at AOL. Judging from the experimental results, the proposed solutions are promising. In  X  Championing an LTV Model for an LTC  X  Freeman and Melli review some of the organizationa l hurdles that the implementation of a data mining system can encounter within a large corporation. The specific application is a predictive model for customer lifetime value at a large telecommunications company. The paper will be of particular interest to senior data miners that are also required to successfully champion a data mining project into fruition. In " Mining Source Code Elements for Comprehending Object-Oriented Systems and Evaluating Their Maintainability " Kanellopoulos, Dimopulos, Tjortjis, and Makris describe the application of data mining to the process of the maintenance of object-oriented software. Devel oping reliable complex software systems is key to software e ngineering. The approach used involves the clustering of source code in order to recover knowledge about a software X  X  structure and maintainability  X  much of a maintainers' time is typically spent for program comprehension. The paper incl udes a novel and comprehensive approach to empirical validation. In " Text mining for product attribute extraction " Ghani, Probst, Liu, Krema and Fano investigate th e application of data mining to the data preparation step in predictive modeling within the retail industry. One of the challenges faced by the practioner is this domain, whether the task is demand forecasting, assortment optimization or product recommendations, is the extraction of relevant attributes. Of current interest in particular is the extraction of implicit attributes. In " Service Quality Improvement Through Business Process Management based on Data Mining " S-H. Ha and S-C. Park present an application of a divers e set of data mining methods to the analysis of root factors for customer complaints. They describe an implementation for a life insurance company that pinpoints where complaints ha ppened, the relationship among problems and the cause of problem s. The problem is important and non-trivial because customer reactions are independent of the internal architecture of the business. In " Market Basket Recommendations for the HP SMB Store " Singh, Thomas and Sepulveda pres ent the application of market basket analysis to Hewlett-Packard X  X  online store and call center for cross-sell and up-sell associa tions. The paper illustrates the commonly face challenge of performing a proof-of-concept within an extremely short time frame as a prerequisite for the funding of a system X  X  implementation. In " Revenue Recovering with Insolvency Prevention on a Brazilian Telecom Operator " Pinheiro, Evsukoff and Ebecken present the application of a data mining to the prediction of customers that may be associated with bad debt events, such as non-payment. This topic has received significant interest from both service companies and data mining vendors, but few case studies have been published to da te. The paper covers several of the phases in the data mining process including a customer segmentation phase. In " Data-driven Modeling of Acute Toxicity of Pesticide Residues " Lemke, Benfenati, and Mueller present an application of data mining to the analysis of chemical compounds toxicity to reduce the cost and time associated with the animal testing required by regulation. The pape r interestingly presents both a theorical and analytical review of a solution to the modeling of high-dimensional noisy data. In conclusion we hope that this special issue will inspire the reader to tackle even more am bitious initiatives and will also encourage them to share in their insights with others. Many data mining application areas remain undocumented. This collection illustrates how case studies may assist in the understanding of how whole data mining problems can be solved. Interesting applications, particularly those w ith direct social benefits, will help to raise awareness of the positive role that data mining can play in science and society.
