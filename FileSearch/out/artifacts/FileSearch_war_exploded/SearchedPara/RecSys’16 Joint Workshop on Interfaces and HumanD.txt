 As intelligent interactive systems, recommender systems fo-cus on determining predictions that fit the wishes and needs of users. Still, a large majority of recommender systems re-search focuses on accuracy criteria and much less attention is paid to how users interact with the system, and in which way the user interface has an influence on the selection be-havior of the users. Consequently, it is important to look beyond algorithms. The main goals of the IntRS workshop are to analyze the impact of user interfaces and interaction design, and to explore human interaction with recommender systems. Methodologies for evaluating these aspects are also within the scope of the workshop.

The complexity of decision tasks, limited cognitive re-sources of recommender systems users, and a tendency to keep decision efforts as low as possible are related to the phenomenon of bounded rationality [12], i.e., users tend to focusing on topics of designing and developing novel intelli-gent interfaces and evaluating their impact in terms of differ-ent dimensions such as usability, perceived recommendation quality, time needed to take a decision, decision quality and degree of subjective well-being [7]. A primary goal of the workshop is to foster a community with a strong focus on recommendation-related decision making and user interface design issues.
The workshop covers three interrelated themes : (1) user interfaces (e.g., visual interfaces, explanation interfaces, natural language interfaces, trust-aware and social inter-faces, context-aware interfaces, ubiquitous and mobile inter-faces, and decision making interfaces), (2) interaction mech-anisms, user modeling, and decision making (e.g., cognitive modeling for recommender systems, human -recommender interaction, controllability, decision theories, preference con-struction, interfaces that take into account the role of emo-tions, argumentation and persuasive recommendation, cul-tural differences, approaches to high-quality group decision making, and the detection and avoidance of decision biases), and (3) evaluation (e.g., case studies, empirical studies, new interfaces and interaction designs, and evaluation methods).
Topics of contributions submitted to this year X  X  workshop are matchmaking for decision support, explanation inter-faces, cross-cultural aspects of recommender user interfaces, decision biases triggered by recommender user interfaces, effects of user interfaces on the perceived recommendation quality, and novel applications.
The 3rd Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human De-cision Making for Recommender Systems (IntRS X 16) is a result of merging two original RecSys workshops: Hu-man Decision Making and Recommender Systems (De-cisions@RecSys  X  2010 X 2013) and Interfaces for Recom-mender Systems (InterfaceRS X 12) . The idea of merging the two workshops was motivated by the strong inter-relationship between user interface and human decision mak-ing topics. The combination of these two aspects seems to be highly attractive, for example, the IntRS X 15 work-shop in Vienna had 60 participants. The list of accepted IntRS X 16 papers and the workshop schedule can be found at: intrs16.wordpress.com .
IntRS aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from areas related to users interfaces and decision making in recommender systems. This year X  X  contributions are high quality and are expected to attract a large audience.
