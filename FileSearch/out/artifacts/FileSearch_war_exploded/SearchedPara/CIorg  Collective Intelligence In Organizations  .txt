 Web 2.0 tools are penetrating into organizations after their successful adoption in the consumer domain (e.g., social networking; sharing of photos, videos, tags, or bookmarks; wiki-based editing). Some of these new tools and the collaborative processes that they support on the large scale are often referred to as Co llective Intelligence (CI). The workshop brings together leading researchers and designers who are studying or developing CI tools aimed at workers in organizations. The goal is to further articulate the emerging research agenda for this new CSCW area and define new observed forms of CI in organization. Studies of communities, CI tools, and new methods are discussed. Collective intelligence, CSCW, organization, enterprise2.0 H5.m. Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): Miscellaneous. The vision of enabling Collective Intelligence though technology is not new. Early research on collaborative computing or groupware during the 70s had already proposed the possibility of allowing large groups of dislocated people to carry out complex tasks by collaborating and coordinating each others X  activities [9]. Over the last decade, this vision has become a feasible reality; especially after interactive Web 2.0 tools were introduced and adopted. Crowds of non-expert users became able to generate their own content, share it, and collectively organize it in tools such as Wikis, Blogs, Q&amp;A forums, del.icio.us, Flickr, and Twitter. As these Web 2.0 tools became widely adopted, new forms of collective intelligent behaviors have started to appear. Systems like Wikipedia have allowed million of people to collaboratively create and orga nize content with mechanisms that do not fix a priori what the final outcome will look like or by whom or when it should be produced. Using tools such as del.icio.us or Flickr, large communities of users have shared, respectively, their bookmarks or their photos, and have categorized them with us er-defined tags. As a result, rich corpora of shared annotated resources have been created for these communities to reuse and augment. These tools, the large-scale processes that they support, and the value they produce are ex amples of what has been recently referred to as Collecti ve Intelligence (CI) [10]. The research on these early successf ul examples of  X  X I in the wild X  (i.e., the public web) has started to highlight which social and technical preconditions need to be in place for such intelligent behaviors to appear (see research on Wikipedia). The behaviors are referred to as  X  X ntelligent X  because they enhance people X  X  ab ilities to adapt and control their social, informational, and physical environment. As a follow up of a first workshop held at ACM CSCW 2010 [4] and the planning of a journal issue on the topic, this workshop at ACM Group 2010 provides a forum for discussing novel tools, studies, and methods for supporting or investigating CI in organizations (e.g., large business enterprises, government or military institutions, or local communities). The workshop brings together leading researchers and designers who are studying or developing CI tools aimed at workers in organizations. The objective is to further articulate the research agenda for this new area. While we keep in the background general research questions about CI (e.g., What defines the forms of CI that are enabled by new web 2.0 technologies?) [10], we bring to the foreground specific questions about CI in the organization: What distinguishes these forms of CI from those enabled in the consumer Web? What properties define them? What conditions facilitate or hinder them? A longer list of questions for the invited contributions is provided below. Examples of adaptations of web 2.0 tools to the new context of large organizations include tools such as IBM X  X  social bookmarking software Dogear [11], wiki platforms such as Wikispaces (wikispaces.com) or TikiWiki (tikiwiki.org), and tagging tools for sharing using email such as Mail2Tag [12]. Emulating the success of social network systems for consumers such as Facebook or LinkedIn, new tools such as IBM X  X  Social Blue (or Beehive) [14] or Novell X  X  Pulse are being proposed for the enterprise. Similarly, in microblogging, the success of Twit ter as consumer tool has motivated the introduction of tools such as Yammer in enterprises. These tools help managers with project management and awareness of multiple ongoing activities in the organization. Moreover, several commercial web platforms targeted at enterprise s have appeared over the past years, such as IBM X  X  LotusL ive, Microsoft X  X  SharePoint, Jive X  X  Social Business Soft ware, and SAP X  X  NewWeaver. These platforms include social functions that can be considered CI tools. Finally, a few exemplars of CI tools native to organizations have started to emerge. These include Idea Management System for supporting grassroots innovation in large enterprises such as IBM, Dell, Microsoft or tools for e-democracy or collaborative decision-making in local communities [7]. The ongoing process of diffusion of Web 2.0 tools from the consumers X  space to the organiza tions X  space is still lacking an organized body of research literature, which can orient design in this new domain. To start filling this gap, this workshop invites recent contribu tions aimed at studying or supporting CI in the organization. In fact, the organization is likely to pose distinctive requirements and constraints for intelligent behaviors to emerge. For example, the experience of the Web has shown that letting behavior emerge is a winning strategy when a large population of users is in place who can  X  X aturally X  let order, as well as quality control, materialize from the bottom. In stead, organizations such as business enterprises, government, educational, or military institutions have structures th at are different from the web: the scale is different, a top-down control structure is already in place, and the employees have specific motivations, skills, and duties. Two general properties can be observed in socio-technical systems that exhibited CI in the wild: First, the bottom-up, non-scripted genesis of the community of users, which self-organizes, and, second, the formation of a common capital (e.g., re-usable knowledge) via selective accumulation of shared by-products of individual activities, which may be motivated initially by personal utility. In fact, individual consumers adopt CI tools for the specific purpose for which it was initially designed (e.g., shared editing or bookmarking), but at the same time the tool enables the accumulation of critical by-pr oducts such as detailed interaction traces and individual contributions (e.g., a wiki page, a bookmark). When aggregated, these become a source of further information that can be then reused by the community. As a new context for CI, enterprises such as private organizations or public institutions have unique properties: People . The people using technology are knowledge workers, who perform specific and stable jobs. They generally know each other (even indirectly), are paid to work, and are part of a reporting structure. Their contributions are monitored and evaluated. Moreover, in the organization, there is an emphasis on utilizing teams, task forces, and communities as a strategy to improve performan ce. Such work units are not formed on the basis of personal interest, but are assembled by the management, given the functions needed and the experts available. Typically, the worker s have to coordinate with (and rely on) others for the organization to be productive as a whole. Tools and tasks . Both the tasks performed and the tools used (email, phone, content editing tools, databases) are non-discretionary. Typically, they are assigned by the management and not chosen by the workers. Past research has already pointed to the potential conflicts between who gets the benefits and who bears the costs of using the tools (e.g., [8]). Also distinctive is that the tasks are information intensive. Knowledge workers in global enterprises increasingly need to make sense of large amounts of information from multiple channels or information tools. Goodness criteria . The criteria to evaluate and predict the goodness of technology are also different. In the consumer space, these are mainly the utilit y to the user, quality of user experience (e.g., simplicity and fun), and social benefits. In the organizations, the key crit eria are also the worker X  X  productivity (e.g., worker X  X  output and workload), the organization X  X  productivity (i.e., ROI), political returns, security, and compatibility with the legacy infrastructure. Therefore additional constraints for CI tools in organizations include the compatibility with pr ior tools, security, costs of maintaining new tools, and the fit with the current management structure, work practices, and motivational mechanisms. Task forces represent a tactic that is currently used to enhance the CI of organizations. A task force is a cooperative work unit assembled to perform a complex task or activity. The term indicates a temporary, ad-hoc unit that works as a committee of professionals on a given project (e.g., develop a report on climate change, evaluate opportunities in a new business area). The same professional typically contributes to multiple task forces at the same time. In fact, the managers of large organizations rely on task forces to coordinate expert work around complex tasks and at the same time make optimal reuse of highly skilled professionals [e.g., 13]. Task forces tend to cross boundaries within the organization (e.g., involving people from different company departments) [3]. The recurrent need to find experts [1] and the demanding and constrained conditions of the experts who work in multiple task forces makes these workers a good target for CI tools. Enabling forms of CI in organizations (i.e., new skills and adaptive behaviors) that persist and improve across succeeding task forces and individual tasks requires appropriate social and technological engineering. Future design of CI tools can build on pr ior research in areas such as communities of practice and learning, social networks and information foraging (e.g., [ 13]). In fact, according to Wenger, the communities of practices within the organizations are key mechanism used for building their competence and adapting such competence over time (i.e., communities for professional development). He defines organizations as  X  X ocial designs directed at practice X  [17]. Thus, new collaborative tools that support learning and development in persistent communities of professionals can, over time, promote new forms of CI. The design of CI tools for organizations that, for example, enhance the performance of domai n-specific task forces in the short term and support the development of communities of practices in the long term is likely to benefit from a detailed understanding of the attributes, tools, and work practices that characterize current task forces and communities in organizations. This understanding can point the designers toward the needs that CI tools might address and can help to smoothly integrate the tools with existing work processes. A deeper understanding of current practices can help answering foundational questions about CI tools for organizations such as:  X  What defines the forms of CI that emerge in specific  X  What are the organizational processes that are best  X  What is the degree of domain modeling that the tools  X  What are available traces from previous activities and  X  What visualizations and abstractions can help to  X  How do factors such as trust, motivation, attribution,  X  What mix of research methods , such field studies and Given the socio-technical nature of these research questions, we believe that multi-method research agenda that integrates data from field studies, interviews, surveys, and computer logs is best suited to inform the design and evaluation of prototypes and thus build suitable CI tools for both the workers and their organization. The workshop organizers have conducted various studies of computer-supported teams, task forces, and communities in the industry (e.g., IBM, Xerox) or in public institutions (e.g., public administration, universities, emergency management organizations) and have extensive experience in design of collaborative tools [2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 16]. The workshop is held over a full day. The agenda allocates maximum time to small group discussion and brainstorming. The workshop assembles a diverse set of participants with a research or an applied interest for CI in organizations. Contributions pertain to the following categories:  X  Empirical studies of communities or collaborative  X  Designs of new software tools or proof-of-concept  X  Theoretical contributions on CI , crowdsourcing, and  X  Cases of multidisciplinary research showing the Key thematic areas of interest of the workshop include: 1. Feeding CI . Knowledge creation, capture and use: infrastructures; e.g., Q&amp;A, sharing and lurking in CMS. 2. Exploiting and institutionalizing CI .
