 Recommender Systems(RS) provide more accurate and more relevant recommendations using contextual feature(s). This accuracy improvement is at the cost of computational ex-penses. Therefore, finding and selecting the most relevant contextual features is an important problem. Moreover, modeling and incorporating the selected contextual features in RS algorithms has an impact on both the accuracy and computational cost. We are conducting a series of studies to detect, define, select, model and incorporate the most relevant contextual features for RS algorithms. The fea-ture detection, definition and selection approach involves the evaluation of features derived from implicit and explicit in-formation. The selected features from this approach can be modeled and incorporated in any selected RS algorithm. In our recent works, we also propose a series of algorithms that incorporates multiple contextual features in the baseline ma-trix factorization (MF) algorithm. We use the selected con-textual features to modify user biases and item biases in the baseline MF.

Traditional RS consider only the information regarding the items and the users in order to provide recommenda-tion. However, in some tasks user X  X  opinion about an item might vary from one situation to another [1]. For these cases, it is important to consider contextual information as addi-tional information to generate more relevant recommenda-tions. Context Aware Recommender Systems (CARS) are one of the emerging topics of study in the field of RS. The studies in this field includes the investigations on how to model and incorporate contextual information in a tradi-tional RS. Detecting, defining and selecting contextual fea-tures to be modeled and incorporated in RS algorithms is non-trivial. For this reason, it is important to carefully eval-uate each contextual information to determine if it is rele-vant and ultimately if it can improve the accuracy of the system.

The general research question to be addressed in our pro-posed work is How to detect, define, select, model and in-corporate contextual information into RS algorithms? This question is broken down into four specific questions: RQ1. Which information can be considered as contextual informa-tion for a specific recommendation task? In any recommen-dation task there is an interaction between the user and the system that provides recommendation. Through this inter-action there are several user related foot prints that may reveal the characteristics of the situation that user interacts with the system. RQ2. How to define contextual infor-mation as contextual features to be used in RS algorithms? Contextual information, in their original format, often can not be incorporated in RS algorithms. RQ3. How to se-lect the most relevant contextual features to be used in RS algorithms? Not all contextual features can increase the accuracy of prediction. It is important to select the most relevant contextual features. We proposed a novel contex-tual feature selection in a recent work. RQ4. How to model and incorporate contextual features into a traditional RS al-gorithm? Each RS algorithm has unique feature modeling and incorporation requirements. Selected contextual fea-tures should then be modeled to match the requirements of the selected RS algorithm. In our prior work [2] we evalu-ated baseline MF algorithm and its requirements. We pro-pose an extension to MF algorithm that incorporates multi-ple  X  X ser-based X  and  X  X tem-based X  contextual features. In a recent work, we proposed and tested a context aware MF al-gorithm that incorporates multiple  X  X ser-based X  contextual features.
