 The customer reviews for products provided by many websites are very helpful for sumer reviews. The main idea is to treat sentiment block identification task as a word sequence labeling problem, thus it can be solved with conditional random fields model (CRF) by introducing template feature. In this paper, Sentiment blocks mean the phrases with sentiment polarity. For many user reviews in forums, the expressions are usually arbitrary, such as:  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X ( X  X f only the screen is bigger X ),  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X ( X  X he energy of the battery is exhausted in less than two days X ), here  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  is sentiment blocks. Obviously the traditional methods can not identify such blocks very well and are not sensitive to such valuable information; correspondingly the overall system performance will be adversely affected. Early sentiment analyses focus on coarse-grained sentiment analysis [1-6], and word-level sentiment analysis [3-5]. As a coarse-grained analysis, document-level and sen-analysis, but often a word can not represent the emotion of the entire sentence. 
Phrase-level sentiment analysis mainly has the following difficulties: 1. From a phrases, we often have to consider its cont ext. In recent years, the phrase-level senti-ment analysis is also increasing. Jeonghee Yi includes noun phrase with emotional word, and emotional words into the sentiment blocks [7], Turney [3], considers noun take into account the context of sentiment bl ocks (phrase). Wilson [8,9] considers the part of speech of words near the current wo rd, the location of the current word in the Yao [10] and others make in-depth study in fine-grained sentiment analysis, and their focus is to find the relationship between themes and sentiment-descriptive term. However the sentiment-descriptive term, i.e. the sentiment blocks mentioned above, can only be extracted around the emotional word. the template feature to identifies the sentiment blocks from the user reviews. Given a  X  y ,where  X  X B X  is the first word of positive positive sentiment block with only one word,  X  X B X , X  X E X , X  X BE X  is label correspond-block. For example:  X   X   X   X  /O  X  /DB  X  X  X  /DE  X  /O  X  X  X  (F6)/O  X  /DB  X  X  /DE  X  /O  X  /DB  X  /DE  X  /O X . The detailed description of CRF can be found in [11]. 
We introduce some sequence features, such as word sequence feature, POS (Part-of Speech) sequence feature, emotional words feature, modifier feature, and bug fea-ture. In addition, we also introduce the template feature. block identification. For example, sentiment block such as  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X ( X  very beauti-ful  X ), X   X  X  X   X   X ( X  very good  X ), the corresponding template is  X  X odifier + emotional word X , while sentiment block such as  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X ( X  (battery) is exhausted in less than two days  X ), X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X ( X ( The mobile phone ) is broken in less than three months  X ), the corresponding template is  X  X   X  X  X   X + numeral+ quantifier + X   X   X   X . 
After the Chinese word segmentation and part of speech tagging on the training dictionary, modifier dictionary and mobile phone bug dictionary. The attribute set of each word includes POS tagging pos , bug label bug , emotional word label pol , modi-fier label mod , where } , { O BUG bug  X  , } , , { O DOWN UP pol  X  , (4) UP = =
From (1) to (5) the priority is decreasing. After the two words match with each other, we give them a common marker, which is the so-called match-marker. The decreasing condition, we consider the highest-priority matching condition as their final match con-ditions, and offer them the corresponding tag. For example, two sentiment block:  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X ( X  very beautiful  X ) and  X   X  X  X   X   X ( X  very good X  ), they meet two matching condition: is UP pol pol = = 2 1 , and offer them corresponding tag: UP_P. Next, we will consider the LCS (Longest Common String) between two blocks, and follow the matching method describe above. Template extraction algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. 
The features we choose include: (1) word sequence feature, (2) part of speech se-bug feature (6) template feature. (1) Word sequence. For the word sequence feature, we mainly select the current word after current word . (2) POS sequence. For the POS sequence feature, we select POS of current word and POS of words in its [-2,2] window, that is, POS of the current word, POS of word before the current word, POS of second word after the current word . (3) Emotional words. Considering sentiment block such as "  X  X  X  X  X  X  ", emotional current word, first word after current word, second word after current word, we consider whether they are emotional words. Word with positive polarity is marked as UP, word with negative polarity is marked as DOWN, non-emotional word is marked as O. (4) Modifiers features. Similar to (3), modifiers often appear in the 1-2 position be-fore the emotional words, so we introduce the modifiers feature. We set the window [-word, second word before current word. We consider whether they are modifiers. Positive modifiers are marked as UP, negative modifiers are marked as DOWN, non-modifiers are marked as O. (5) Mobile phone bug features. Considering bug-words often express strong feeling of people, so the introduction of mobile phone bug feature is necessary. We consider whether a word is a bug-word, bug-word is marked as BUG, otherwise marked as O. word with corresponding template label, such as D_1, where D represents the polarity of the template, 1 represents the template label. If it does not match any template, it is marked as O. In order to evaluate the performance of our approach, we conducted our experiments using the customer reviews downloaded from the mobile phone website it168 (http://pinglun.it168.com), we manually annotated 1000 user reviews (including 3941 compound sentences) as our experimental data. 4.1 Baseline In our experiments, the Baseline method is as follows: first find the emotional word, and then find modifiers around the emotional word, and we consider the emotional words and their corresponding modifiers together as one sentiment block. We use the emotional words as the center, and set a [-5,5] window. The border isn X  X  beyond current sentence borders. For example, for the sentence  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X   X   X   X   X  X he ringtone is pleasant, and the screen is clear X   X  ,the phrase  X   X   X   X  and  X   X   X   X  X  X   X  are sentiment blocks, which is underlined. 4.2 Tagging with CRF model According to different feature combination, we design three experiments. The feature sequence feature and POS sequence feature, T2 represents modifier feature and emo-tional words feature, T3 represents the template feature. 4.3 Experimental Strategy and Results = other. ) lapped in position, which is different from the one mentioned in formula (1).). Experiment 1: Threshold Selection. The purpose of experiment 1 is to determine the optimal threshold  X  in template extraction step. The result is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that when  X  is 0.7, the performance is optimal. Experiment 2: Comparison of precision, recall and F-measure for four different methods. The comparison of precision, recall, F-measure for four methods is given in Table 2. The result shows that: 1. The word sequence labeling method based on the CRF model is better than the 2. According to the results of CRF_2 and CRF_1, we can see the introduction of 3. According to the results of CRF_3 and CRF_2, we can see the introduction of the Experiment 3: Comparison of average matching degree. The method of calculating matching degree is shown in formula (2), the experimental result are shown in Fig.4. It suggests that: For methods based on CRF model, the average matching degree can achieve more than 60%. CRF_3 is still the best method, whose average matching degree can achieve almost 70%. Experiment 4: We design 2 sub-experiments, in each experiment we divide the sen-pare performance of the four methods. 1. Positive sentiment blocks &amp; Negative sentiment blocks In this experiment, we divide sentiment blocks into positive blocks and negative blocks, and then we compare performance of the four methods. The experimental sentiment block identification is superior to that of negative sentiment block identifi-cation. Because compared to positive sentiment block, negative sentiment block contains relatively more colloquial expression, like "  X  X  X  X  X  ", "  X  X  X  X  " and etc. Colloquial expression makes the sentiment block identification more difficult; 2). value for negative sentiment block identification has been achieved. Template feature can help CRF model perform better in such colloquial expression. 
In this experiment, we divide sentiment blocks into sentiment blocks with emo-tional words and that without emotional word s, and then we compare performance of generally the performance of sentiment blocks identification with emotional words reason is that sentiment blocks without emotional words are mostly very colloquial expression; 2) CRF_3 X  X  performance is best, especially for the sentiment blocks without emotional words. Compared with CRF_2, the recall value of CRF_3 has increased about 5 percentages , it is because the template feature can help model do better in such colloquial expression. 2.Two-word sentiment blocks &amp; Three-word sentiment blocks &amp; Multi-word sentiment blocks In this experiment, we divide sentiment blocks into two-word sentiment blocks, three-word sentiment blocks and multi-word sentiment blocks. The experimental compari-son of the four methods is shown in Fig. 5. It reveals similar phenomenon as above from a different perspective: 1) generally, the performance of two-word sentiment blocks identification is better than that of three-word and multi-word sentiment blocks multi-word sentiment blocks; 2) CRF_3 X  X  performance is best, and for the multi-word sentiment blocks, the performance gets the most obvious increase because tem-plate feature can help model do better in such kind of sentiment blocks. In this paper, we have proposed a sentiment block identification method which is based on CRF model. Some different feature combinations have been tried, and found that the introduction of template feature can enhance the performance of the CRF model. Our approach has two advantages: 1). to some extent, it takes into account the multi-word blocks or blocks with discontinuous word sequence. Acknowledgments.
