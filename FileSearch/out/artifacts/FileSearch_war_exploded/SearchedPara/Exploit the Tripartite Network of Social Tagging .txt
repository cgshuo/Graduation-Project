 In this poster, we investigate how to enhance web clustering by leveraging the tripartite network of social tagging systems. We propose a clustering method, called  X  X ripartite Clustering X , which cluster the three types of nodes (resources, users and tags) simultaneously based on the links in the social tagging network. The proposed method is experimented on a real-world social tagging dataset sampled from del.icio.us. We also compare the proposed clustering approach with K-means. All the clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained web directory. The experimental results show that Tripartite Clustering significantly outperforms the c ontent-based K-means approach and achieves performance close to that of social annotation-based K-means whereas generating much more useful information.

Social tagging systems allow users to a nnotate resources with free-form tags. The resources can be of any type or in any format, such as web pages, videos, photos, an d so on. Despite focusing on different types of resources, all the social tagging systems have the common purpose of helping users share, store, organize and retrieve the resources they are interested in. The social tagging systems can be modeled as a tripartite network formed by users, resources and tags. Whenever a user applies a the resource and the tag. The w hole network of social tagging system provides valuable information for learning the topics of web resources, the sema ntics of tags and the interest of users. Hyperlink network has been expl oited for web mining tasks such as ranking web search results [6, 7], classifying hypertext [2, 8], and clustering web pages [1]. The network formed in social tagging systems provides another ri ch information source for web mining. However, the tripartite structure of the social tagging network differs fundamentally from well-studied hyperlink graph. In this poster, we examine how the tripartite network of social tagging systems can be exploited for web clustering. The tripartite network of social ta gging system has been studied in previous research [3, 5, 10, 11, 13]. However, it has rarely been exploited for clustering purpose . This poster is dedicated to exploring whether and how the links that forms the tripartite network of social tagging can be utilized for improving web clustering. For this purpose, we de vise a special clustering method based on the properties of the so cial tagging network. Different from other clustering approaches, which only cluster single type of data objects, the proposed cl ustering method can cluster the simultaneously. Accordingly, we call this method as  X  X ripartite Clustering X . In order to evaluate the performance of Tripartite Clustering, we experiment it on a real-world social tagging dataset sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a user-maintained web directory (Open Directory Project X  X DP). Moreover, we also compare Tripartite Clustering with content-based K-means and K-means incorporating social annotations. The experimental re sults show that Tripartite Clustering significantly outper forms content-based K-means approach and achieves performance close to that of social annotation-based K-means whereas producing much more useful information. In this section, we introduce th e Tripartite Clustering model on social tagging network. A social tagging system can be represented as a tripartite network, which can be denoted as: U, R, and T are finite sets of users, resources, and tags; E E network: user-resource, use r-tag, and resource-tag. In this tripartite netw ork, each type of nodes can be characterized by its links to the other two types of nodes. For instance, a resource r i can be represented with: The user node and tag node can be modeled likewise. With this representation model, the three types of nodes of the social tagging network can be cluste red separately through any VSM (Vector Space Model)-based clus tering methods. However, by clustering the three types of nodes separately, we ignore the iterative interactions among differen t types of nodes. In a typical social tagging system, we can find that topically-related web pages are usually annotated with semantically-related tags by users with similar interests; and semantically-related tags are usually assigned to resources with similar topics and by users with similar interests; also, users with common interests usually annotate topically-related web pa ges using semantically-related tags. Therefore, it is desirable to have an iterative clustering approach which is capable of ut ilizing the interactions among the cluster structures of different types of nodes. In order to make use of the interactions among the cluster structures of different types of nodes, we propose an extended K-means approach to cluster the tripartite network of social tagging. Following the K-means approach, the proposed approach takes the cluster numbers as input and initially randomizes the cluster assignment of each node. Then it iteratively calculates the centroid of each cluster and reassigns each node to the closest cluster based on the distance between the node and the centroid of each cluster. However, the centroid of the cluster is calculated differently from the traditional K-means, where the coordinates of a cluster centroid vector are the arithmetic mean for each dimension separately over all th e nodes in the cluster. In the proposed approach, the centroid of a cluster is decided not only by the features of the nodes in current cluster, but also by the cluster structures of other two types of nodes. For example, the center of a resource cluster is calculated based on the link features of the resource nodes included in this cluster as well as the cluster structures of user nodes and tag nodes. can be represented with a user li nk vector and a tag link vector as described above. Let X  X  fi rst consider the user link vectors of these resources. Then the value of the centroid vector of this cluster at dimension u  X  is calculated as follows: , where C l (U) ( 1&lt;l&lt;k U ) is the cluster that user u represents any user node included in cluster C l (U) from r i to u h . We can see that, based on equation (3), the value of a resource cluster centroid at dimension u  X  does not only depends relies on the links from other user s (those belonging to the same cluster as u  X  ) to the resources in the cluster. Figure 1. The distance between a resource node and the centroid of a resource cluster is influenced by the cluster structures of the user nodes. Figure 3 shows the effect of th e proposed method for calculating cluster centroid on the resulted distance value. In Figure 3, r r comprises a resource cluster C 1 (R) . u 1 , u 2 same user cluster C 1 (U) , and u 4 , u 5 and u cluster C 2 (U) . The user link vectors of r 1 and r 0&gt; and &lt;0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0&gt; respectively. r 3 is another resource to be clustered with user link vector &lt;0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1&gt;. In traditional K-means approach, the resulting centroid vector of C 1 (R) 0, 1, 0.5, 0&gt;. If calculated base d on Cosine similarity, then the similarity between r 3 and the centroid vector of C Now, let X  X  considering the cluster structures of the user nodes, and calculate the centroid of the res ource vector using equation (3), then we get the centroid vector of r 1 and r 2 as &lt;1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2&gt;, and the cosi ne similarity between r changes to about 0.338. In Figure 1, we can see that, although the user nodes connected to r 3 and cluster C 1 (R) are different, they are similar nodes belonging to the same user clusters C 1 (U) and C 2 (U) . Therefore, the proposed approach for calculating cluster centroid genera tes more reasonable distance value by considering the cluster structures of user nodes. The centroid of a resource cluster based on tag link vectors can be calculated in the same way. Then the distance from a resource r follows: , where d(R i (U) , centroid m (U) ) denotes the distance between r the centroid of C m (R) based on the resources X  user link vectors; and resources X  tag link vectors.  X  quantifies the influence of the resource X  X  user link vector on its clustering. The distance can be measured based on various similarit y metrics. In this poster, we adopt the cosine similarity. The di stance from a user (tag) node to the centroid of a user (tag) cluster can be calculated likewise. Based on the proposed distance me trics, we develop an iterative clustering algorithm called Tripar tite Clustering to discover the cluster structures of the social tagging network. The algorithm is shown in Table 1. In order to evaluate the proposed clustering method, we prepare a real-world social tagging dataset crawled from the del.icio.us website during January 2009 and February 2009. The original dataset contains 3,246,424 posts crea ted by 4784 users. In order to decrease link sparseness, we filte red out URLs that are annotated only once and tags that are used only once in our dataset, which results in 1,827,308 posts. Although, all the three types of nodes of social tagging are clustered through tripartite cluste ring, in our experiment, we only focus on the evaluation of the web pa ge clusters, due to the lack of ground truth for user clusters and tag clusters. Following the approach adopted in [9], we use the web categories of Open Directory Project (ODP) as the st andard of web page clusters. ODP is a human-edited hierarchi cal Web directory containing 17 top-level categories. We only keep its 14 top-level categories as the clustering standard. By overlapping the URLs from the del.icio.us dataset with the URLs listed under the 14 categories of ODP, we obtained 19222 URLs appearing in 181,958 posts. We also crawled the page text of the URLs, and 18509 of them had their page text crawled successf ully. So the final dataset for Experiment contains 18509 URLs, 19452 tags and 4543 Users. Cluster quality is evaluated base d on three metrics, F-score [4], purity [14], and normalized mutual information (NMI) [12]. The cluster number of resources (web pages) is set to 14, equal to the number of ODP categories. Th e cluster number of user nodes and tag nodes are arbitrarily set to 14 and 28. The distance between node and cluster centroi d is measured with cosine similarity. The value of  X  in equation (5) is set to 0.5. Because the clustering algorithm relies on ra ndom initialization, we run the algorithm 10 times and use the mean of each quality metric across the 10 runs as the final score. For each run, the number of iterations is set to 30. Table 4. Top 10 frequent tags of 6 randomly selected clusters Table 3 shows the clustering quality of URLs. Although the clustering results of tags cannot be evaluated quantitatively without ground truth, we can stil l get a general estimation about the quality of tag clusters by examining the semantics of tags assigned to each cluster. Table 4 displays the top 10 frequent tags from 6 randomly selected tag clusters. We can see that the top 10 tags in each cluster generally have similar or related semantics. For instance, the tags in cluste r 1 are all related to web2.0 and social network, and tags in cluster 2 are all associated with programming language. With tripartite clustering approa ch, web pages are clustered based on their user link features and tag link features without considering their text content. Here, we compare it with a content-based clustering approach, K-means. Traditional K-means mode ls documents with word vectors. As in [24], in our experiment we expa nd document representation using tag vectors and examine the value of social tags as a new information source for clustering . Specifically, we experiment K-means based on the following vector space models:  X  Word vector : a web document is only represented with the  X  Tag vector : a web document is only represented with the  X  (Word+Tag) vector : Tags applied to a web document are  X  Word vector + Tag vector : Each document is represented The word and tag features are we ighted using term frequency. The experiment parameters are set the same as the Tripartite Clustering: the cluster number K is set to 14; the iteration times is set to 30; each evaluation is run 10 times with random initialization and the average is used as the final clustering result. The clustering based on word vector is viewed as the baseline. 
Table 5. The clustering quality of K-means with different Table 5 lists the results of K-means clustering based on different vector space models. Note that, in table 5, ** and * indicate, compared to the baseline, the improvement is significant according to the paired-sample T-test at the level of p&lt;0.01 and level of p&lt;0.05 respectively. The same notations are also applied in following tables. From Table 5, we can see that K-means based on the word vector+tag vector generates the best results across almost all the quality metrics. It significantly outperforms the baseline method (K-means on word vector alone). K-means on tag vector also improves the performance of baseline significantly. Tripartite Clustering and K-means on social annotation prove the value of social tagging network for web clustering from different perspectives. Table 7 compares the performance of K-means with Tripartite Clustering. For K-means, only the best clustering model (K-means on Word vector +Tag vector ) is shown. K-means on word vector is used as the baseline method. We can see that both K-means and Tripartite Clus tering improve the baseline significantly by incorporating th e social tagging data into the clustering process yet through different ways. K-means on word vector+tag vector treats tag vector as an independent information source from word vector and co mbines it with word vector linearly to determine the distance from a document to a cluster centroid. Tripartite Clustering fully relies on the relationships among the web pages, users and tags for clustering. It clusters the three entities at the same time and the cluster structure of one entity can influence the cluster stru cture of the other two entities. 
Table 7. Comparison of the clustering quality of different From Table 7, we see that the clustering quality of Tripartite Clustering is a little worse than that of K-means on word vector+tag vector. However, th e difference is not significant. Compared to K-means, Tripartite Clustering generates more information, including the cluster st ructures of users and tags as well as the relationships among the clusters of different entities. Moreover, Tripartite Clustering does not rely on the content of annotated resources. Therefore, it can be applied to cluster different types of resources annota ted in a social tagging system, such as images and videos. In this poster, we propose a clus tering method called Tripartite Clustering for discovering the cluster structures of the tripartite network of social tagging. The proposed method is experimented on a real-world social tagging dataset and evaluated against a human-edited web directory. Experi mental results show that the proposed method significantly ou tperforms the content-based K-means approach in clustering the web documents. We also compare the proposed method with K-means which relies on both content words and social tags. It shows that Tripartite Clustering generates equivalent or better re sults while generating more useful information and having broader applications. In future work, we will explore how to utilize the clustering results for improving web search. [1] Angelova, R. and S. Siersdorfer. A neighborhood-based [2] Angelova, R. and G. Weikum.
