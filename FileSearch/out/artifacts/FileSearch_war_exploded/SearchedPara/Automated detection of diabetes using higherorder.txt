Diabetes mellitus, which is usually called diabe tes, is a condition in which the body is unable to me-tabolize glucose effectively which in turn creates an abnormally high level of glucose in the blood (this condition is referred to as hyperglycemia). Diabetes may be caused either due to the inability of the body to produce enough insulin or due to the situation where cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced in the body. Diabetes is difficult to cure, and hence it should be managed well. There are three main types of diabetes, namely, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. Out of these types, Type 2 diabetes is the most commonly prevalent type and in this work, we have used Type 2 diabetes subjects for our study. In 2000, the total number of diabetic people in the world was around 171 million which am ounts to 2.8% of the whole population [64] . The diabetes population is increas-ing, and the number is expected to double by 2030. According to the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse, diabetes management costs 132 billion dollars in the United States alone every year. The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health promotion (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) has predicted that 1 in 3 Americans will develop diabetes sometime in their lifetime [18]. Another study conducted by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) revealed the alarming fact that approximately 23.1% i.e. 12.2 million Americans of age 60 and above have diabetes [10]. All these data and reports point to the necessity of development of effective diabetic management methods. Such methods should specify lifestyles that will help to prevent or delay diabetes and also suggest effective ways for diagnosis and treatment of this disease. In this work, we present a novel method to diagnose the presence of diabetes. Diabetes causes nerve disorders named as diabetic neuropathy. 60 to 70% of diabetic patients have some form of diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy is mainly classified as Pe-ripheral, Autonomic, Proximal, and Focal neuropathy. In this work, we focus on the diabetic neuropathy that affects nerves that control the heart and regulate blood pressure. This neuropathy is called Cardio-vascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN). The heart and blood vessels are part of cardiovascular system. Nerve damage in the cardiovascular system causes problems in blood pressure and heart rate. Autonomic neuropathy affects heart and blood vessels, digestive system, urinary tract, sex organs, sweat glands, and lungs. The high glucose level associated with diabetes causes such complications. Statistics indicate that 50% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke [63]. Diabetic people have heart disease death rates about 2 to 4 times higher than adults without diabetes [42]. In this work, we present a Com-puter Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique that uses the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals determined from the ECGs of patients to detect the presence of diabetes.

Usually the doctors diagnose the normal and diabetes subjects using blood test. Heart rate signals are nonlinear and non-stationary in nature. HOS helps to extract the hidden non-stationary behaviour of the signals. Our present work, helps to detect the normal and diabetes subjects using HOS features and heart rate signals efficiently. Hence, this proposed system can be used to aid the physicians to cross check their diagnosis. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents more information on the link between CAN and diabetes. The description of the data used for this work is given in Section 3. Section 4 presents brief descriptions of the features, statistical techniques, and classifiers used in this work. The selected features and classification results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 contains a discussion on the results obtained. The paper concludes in Section 7. 2. Related work
Diabetes can cause severe autonomic impairments. Hyperglycemia due to diabetes causes cardiovas-cular dysfunction independent of other factors like arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. Poor glycemic control causes precapillary damage. This damage will affect the normal functioning of the en-dothelial cells, blocking the normal pathways of Nitric Oxide (NO) [59]. This means diabetes-induced-hyperglycemia causes reduced activation of phosphorylation cascade, leading to less endothelial NO synthase which is required to synthesize NO. Thus, the availability of NO which is required for vasodi-lation is reduced. Diabetes causes the vessels to be in a vasoconstricted state leading to poor circulation due to all these microvascular endothelial cell impairments.

Hyperglycemia also activates protein kinase C which promotes vasoconstrictive prostanoid produc-tion [17]. Hyperglycemia causes endothelial dysfunction, increases platelets activity and their agre-gability [17, 32]. The consequences are increased adhesion of platelets, monocytes and leukocytes in endothelium, increased fibrinogen and coagulability of blood, decreased fibrinolitic activity. Diabetic patients were found to have significantly lower values of left ventricular ejection fraction and higher values of left ventricular end-systolic diameter compared to normal people. All the above autonomic microvascular damages cause decrease in local reflexes, NO production and nerve blood flow, and heart rate variability also gets reduced. CAN, which causes dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, is thus inherently associated with diabetes leading to reduced heart rate variability. Thus, depressed HRV is an early indicator of diabetic neuropathy [49]. Diabetes also speeds up hardening of arteries (known as atherosclerosis).

Diabetes induced CAN may cause ECG alterations such as sinus tachycardia, long QTc, QT disper-sion, changes in heart rate variability, ST-T changes and left ventricular hypertrophy. Both QTc prolon-gation an ST depression predicted mortality in Type 2 diabetic patients [45]. It was also found that QT dispersion is a possible mortality predictor in diabetic patients [54]. Among these ECG alterations, in this work, the heart rate variability signal was chosen as a measure of cardiac autonomic impairments caused by diabetes.

Sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker of the heart. Spontaneous cardiac impulse generated by the SA node and the influence caused by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems on the conducting tissues of the heart, together determine the normal heart rate. In the absence of any sympathetic or parasympathetic input to the sinus node, the sinus node operates at its intrinsic rate. Normal resting heart rate is decided by the parasympathetic vagus nerve. Acceleration of the heart rate occurs by the inhibition of vagal influence and by the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. In other words, when vagal effects are increased, the heart rate is less than the intrinsic heart rate, and when sympathetic effects are more, the heart rate is greater than the intrinsic heart rate. Thus, instantaneous heart rate is decided by a number of factors. The interval between adjacent QRS complexes is termed as NN or RR interval ( t R-R ). The Heart Rate (HR) in terms of beats per minute is given by HR =60 /t R-R . Thus, the heart rate signal is a time series sequence of non-uniform RR intervals. The variation of RR intervals is defined as Heart Rate Variability (HRV). In other words, HRV indicates variations of instantaneous heart rate. HRV measurements are non-invasive in nature. They are easy to acquire, and when acquired under standardized conditions, HRV signals have good reproducibility [29,38].
HRV signals can be analyzed using time domain and frequency domain methods. Time domain mea-sures involve statistical operations that involve calculating the mean and variance of the RR interval. Important time domain indices are average HR, SDNN (standard deviation of all normal RR intervals), and RMSSD (square root of the mean of the squared differences between successive NN intervals over 24 hours). The disadvantage of time domain measurements is that they are very easily affected by ar-tifacts and outliers. Frequency domain measures analyze Very Low Frequency (VLF), Low Frequency (LF), and High Frequency (HF) components present in the HRV signal. The disadvantage of this method is that the reliability of the spectral measurements decreases with the reduction of signal power and signal-to-noise power. The advantage of the wavelet transform is that it can extract simultaneously both the time and frequency information present in the HRV signals. Wavelet transform was used to analyze HRV signals and obtain a time-scale representation of VLF, LF, and HF bands [28].
 Evidences suggest that heart is not a periodic oscillator under normal physiological conditions [31]. Thus, nonlinear techniques, which extract and analyze the nonlinear features from HRV signals, are also of very good use. Nonlinear features like Lyapunov exponent [53], 1/f slope [39], Approximate Entropy ( ApEn ) [50], Detrended Fluctuation Analysis ( DFA ) [48] can be extracted from the HRV signals for fur-ther analysis. The range over which these parameter values fall gives an indication about the presence or absence of disease. Nonlinear analysis of ECG and HRV was studied [27,51]. ECG arrhythmia detection and classification was performed by nonlinear modeling [46]. HRV signals classification was also done by nonlinear techniques [1,5,7 X 9]. Nonlinear techniques were employed for the analysis of cardiac sig-nals for developing cardiac arrhythmia detection algorithms [6,20,41,57]. The level of oxygenation and blood pressure of fetus was monitored by analysing the Fetal heart rate ( FHR ) variations, making use of feature extraction, linear and nonlinear correlation and nonlinear classifier methods to discriminate aci-demic from normal fetuses [30]. Heart rate and systolic pressure signals were used to assess baroreflex sensitivity ( BRS ) which is an indicator of increased risk of sudden cardiac death in myocardial infarc-tion patients [13]. Another nonlinear technique is to extract Higher Order Spectral ( HOS ) based features from HRV signals for further analysis [23]. The application of HOS to HRV signals and the extraction of features like bispectral entropy etc were introduced [23]. They used HOS of HRV signals to discrimi-nate between normal heartbeat class and seven arrhythmia classes. Further, they have extended this work using SVM for classification [24]. 3. Data acquisition and pre-processing 3.1. Data acquisition
The electrocardiograms (ECG) of 15 patients (10 male and 5 female) with diabetes and of 15 healthy volunteers (8 male and 7 female)) were recorded, with the patients in a relaxed supine position for one hour in one sitting. The subjects under study of diabetes we re in the age group of 50 X 70 years (Mean  X  standard deviation = 58.5  X  6.42 years) and the duration of diabetes for the patient groups was 5 X  15 years. The normal subjects were in the age group of 40 X 60 years (Mean  X  standard deviation = 50  X  8.8 years). ECG was recorded using BIOPAC TM equipment the inbuilt AcqKnowledge software at Kas-turba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India. The ethics committee consisting of senior doctors has approved the data for this research purpose. The recorded data was pre-processed using Pan and Tompkinson X  X  algorithm and heart rate computation was performed using AcqKnowledge and Matlab software. Thus, ECG signals were converted to heart rate time series signals. Figure 1 shows the typical HR signals of normal and diabetic subjects. The ECG sampling rate was 500 Hz. 71 datasets from 15 diabetic people and 71 datasets from 15 normal people were used in this work. 1000 samples were used in each dataset. 3.2. Pre-processing
The original ECG signals were passed through a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 15 Hz to remove the presence of noise in the ECG signal. Then, the signal was passed through a high-pass filter of cut-off frequency of 0.3 Hz to remove baseline wander present in the ECG signal. The band-reject filter of cut-off frequencies 50 Hz was used to remove the power-line interference noise. The ECG signal was fed to a median filter to extract the baseline wander of the processed ECG signal, and then subtracted it from the processed ECG signal to eliminate the baseline wander. Lastly, the R peaks of ECG signal were detected [47,61]. RR interval is defined as the interval between two successive QRS complexes. 4. Methods 4.1. Higher order spectrum (HOS) Generally biomedical signals are nonlinear, non-stationary and non-Gaussian in nature. Higher Order Spectral analysis is a powerful tool for non-linear dynamical analysis of physiological signals. HOS anal-ysis is capable of detecting nonlinearity, deviations from Gaussianity and phase relationships between harmonic components of the signal. HOS is used to analyze HRV signals and extract useful features to be fed to different classifiers. HOS is an effective method to get useful information from nonlinear signal [23,24]. This section deals with the theory of HOS and the features obtained from HOS.
HOS (Polyspectra) is the spectral representation of higher order statistics, i.e moments and cumulants of third and higher order. Since the HOS of Gaussian signals are statistically zero, it can measure non-Gaussianity and separate non-Gaussian signal from an additive mixture of independent non-Gaussian signals and Gaussian noise. Thus, HOS techniques provide high noise immunity. This is specifically useful in cases where the signals are corrupted with Gaussian noise. Another advantage is that HOS can preserve the true phase information of signals. Most of the work done so far is on the third order; its Bispectrum is also defined as Fourier transform of the third order correlation of a signal. It is given by and E [ . ] is expectation operator. Bispectrum gives the cross correlation between frequency components in a two-dimensional frequency plot. It is a triple product evaluated at two frequencies and their sum frequency. For deterministic signals, the expectation operator can be omitted. For deterministic sampled signals, X ( f ) is the discrete-time Fourier transform and is computed using fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) algorithm. The frequency f may be normalized by the Nyquist frequency (half of the sampling fre-quency) for values to lie between 0 and 1. The bispectrum plot shows the nonlinear interactions between harmonic components of a signal. Bispectrum is a function of two frequencies unlike power spectrum which is a function of one frequency variable. Bispectrum can be normalized by the power spectra at component frequencies to ensure the magnitude falls between 0 and 1 [43,44].
 A normalized bispectrum B norm ( f 1 ,f 2 ) is given by where P ( f ) is the power spectrum [34]. The power spectrum gives the signal X  X  power within the fre-quency components considered.
 Bicoherence B CO ( f 1 ,f 2 ) is the squared-magnitude of the normalized bispectrum. Bicoherence is a Chi-square distributed parameter. Bicoherence takes the value of unity if the Fourier components at frequencies f 1 ,f 2 and f 1 + f 2 are perfectly phase-coupled in every data block. If they are at complete random phase, then the bicoherence takes the value as zero. Thus, bicoherence varies only between 0 and 1. In this work, we have focused on proposing unique bispectrum and bicoherence plots for normal and diabetic HRV signals. Since bispectrum and bicoherence are the products of three Fourier coefficients, they exhibit symmetry. The entire two dimensional bi-frequency plane is covered by these plots, and hence, they exhibit six-fold symmetry.

The bispectrum and bicoherence plots (Figs 2 and 3) help us to visually differentiate diabetic and normal HR data by display ing clearly disti nguishable patterns in the bi -freque ncy space. Generally, majority of the bic oherence values in t he bi-fre quency space of each class wil l be of zero bicoherence, i.e. they have random phase and they showed distinct visual pattern. Over this background pattern of zero bicoherence, there are peaks which are higher than this background. These peaks are highly likely to correspond to phase-coupled bicoherence values. The distribution and intensity of these peaks have a distinct difference between normal and diabetes class (Figs 2 and 3).
 Mean bispectrum magnitude is where B ( f 1 ,f 2 ) is the bispectrum of the signal.

This parameter M ave clearly distinguishes classes having similar power spectra but different third order HRV range changes within a class, then the power spectrum and also the mean magnitude of bispectrum will change. This limiting factor can be annulled by normalization.
 The bispectrum phase entropy is where p ( X  n ) is where Here L is the number of points within the region in Fig. 4 and  X  is the phase angle of bispectrum and  X  is the space of the defined region in Fig. 4 and 1( . ) is the indicator function which has the value 1 when phase angle  X  lies within the range of bin  X  n in Eq. (6). The region  X  is termed as the principal domain or the non-redundant region for the computation of bispectrum of real signals.
 in time shift of the input signal will not affect this bispectral phase unlike Fourier phase. There are two additional bispectral entropies  X  Normalized Bispectral entropy ( P 1 ) and Normalized Bispectral squared entropy ( P 2 ) [23,24].
 Normalized Bispectral entropy ( P 1 ) is given by where Normalized Bispectral squared entropy ( P 2 ) is given by Normalized Bispectral squared entropy ( P 3 ) is given by The absolute magnitude and the square of the magnitude are the L 1 and L 2 norms of the bispectrum. For both of these entropies, normalization is done by the sum of the norm over  X  which is the com-plete non-redundant bi-fre quency region. Thus, the entropies will be similar to a probability distribution function (PDF) estimated over the  X  region.

The weighted center of bispectrum (WCOB) is given by where i and j are frequency bin index in the non-redundant region.
 The H parameters are related to the moments of bispectrum.
 The sum of logarithmic amplitudes of bispectrum H 1 is The sum of logarithmic amplitudes of diagonal elements in the bispectrum H 2 The first order spectral moment of amplitudes of diagonal elements of the bispectrum H 3 is All the above features are again defined over the principal domain  X  in Fig. 4. 4.2. Student X  X  t-test as the one that was actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. The lower the p-value is, means of two groups are statistically different. By running the test on the HOS features of normal and diabetic HRV data, we get p-value for each feature. Subsequently, we select those features having low p-value. These features, specifically those with p-value less than 0.05, are said to be of high confidence level (Traditionally, a hypothesis can be rejected if the p-value is less than 0.05). It is these low p-value features that we feed to the classifiers. 4.3. Classifiers
In this work, we have evaluated Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier, Support Vector Ma-chine (SVM) classifier, NaivesBayes classifier (NBC), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and Decision Tree (DT) classifier. A brief description of these classifiers is given below. 4.3.1. Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
A mixture model is comprised of a number of component functions, usually Gaussian, and they are combined to provide multimodal density. GMM is a generalized basic function network where the basis functions are Gaussian functions. It is one of the most statistically developed methods used for clustering and density estimation. The GMM classifier is trained for each of these two classes. Expectation Maxi-mization (EM) is one of the commonly used maximum likelihood algorithms that are used for fitting the mixture model to the training data we give as input [16]. EM requires apriori selection of model order. Generally, the user (person who develops the classifier) can select a suitable number as model order. 4.3.2. Support vector machine (SVM)
In SVM, samples are represented as points in a space. The mapping of samples to points is done in such a way that samples belonging to separate category (i.e. classes) are divided or separated by a very clear gap that is as wide as possible [58]. New samples are mapped to the same space and the decision of which class the sample belongs to is done based on which side of the gap the sample is mapped to. SVM consists of a hyper plane (if there are only two classes) or a set of hyperplanes in a high or infinite dimensional space. These hyperplanes perform the task of classification. The best hyper plane is the one that forms the largest separation or margin between the two classes. Hyperplane is chosen such that the distance from the hyperplane to the nearest sample on each side is maximized. In our case, classification is just to distinguish between the normal and diabetic HRV, so the basic binary SVM classifier was used. The parameters of SVM are found out by using the grid search approach. 4.3.3. NaivesBayes classifier (NBC)
This is a simple classifier based on Bayes theorem, and it has na X ve (strong independence) assump-tions. This classifier has the assumption that the presence of a particular feature of a class is unrelated or not dependent on the presence of any other feature. In all the general cases, NaivesBayes model es-timates parameters using the method of maximum likelihood [33]. NBC has the advantage that a small amount of training data is sufficient to estimate the parameters of the classifier. Since the variables are assumed to be independent, just variances of the variable are required, covariances are not required. 4.3.4. Probabilistic neural network (PNN)
PNN implements a statistical algorithm called kernel discriminant analysis [43]. Here, the operations are organized in a multi-layered feedforward network consisting of four layers. These are the input layer, pattern layer, summation layer, and output layer. 4.3.5. K-nearest neighbour (KNN)
KNN classifier is an instance based classifier. Here, the classification of an unknown sample is per-formed by relating the unknown to a known sample according to some distance or similarity criteria [33]. K-nearest neighbor algorithm, used in KNN classifier, is one of the simplest of classification algorithms. Here, a sample is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors. A sample is assigned a class which is the most common among its K nearest neighbors. K is typically a small positive integer. If K is one, then sample is assigned to the class of its nearest neighbor. Thus, the contribution of the near samples is much more than far samples. We have to assure here that the neighbors should be taken from a set of samples for which correct classification is known. These set of neighbors can be considered as the training sample for this classifier.
 4.3.6. Fuzzy k-means classifier
The basic idea of the fuzzy classifier is that the input data or patterns are allowed to belong to all clus-ters or classes with different degrees of membership [33]. The k-means procedure groups the input data to belong to one of the k clusters. The fuzzy k-means classifier, with the help of a membership function, allows the data to belong to more than one class or group. The fuzzy k-means approach develops classes which are, in general, softly overlapping with the degree of overlap being controlled by a user-specified parameter. The partitions are determined by the learning procedure of the classifier. 4.3.7. Decision tree (DT) classifier
DT classifier splits a complex decision-making process into simpler decisions which can be analysed easily. The output is generated as a binary tree-like structure. A decision tree partitions the training set in a recursive way until each partition consists of dominant samples from one class. 5. Results The selected HOS features are presented in Section 5.1, and the classification results are shown in Section 5.2. 5.1. Selected HOS features
In Table 1, the eight clinically significant HOS features (p-value of less than 0.05) were listed. For all the features except H3 and H4, normal parameter values are higher than the values obtained from the diabetic cases. The values of the features Ent1, Ent2, and Ent3 are slightly higher for the normal data than for the diabetic cases. In the case ofH1 and H2, normal values show a marked increase from the diabetic values. The other parameters, namely, mAmp (also known as M ave ), wcob (a vector consisting of parameters wcobx, wcoby, acobx, acoby) had a p-value 0.15, and hence, were not considered. Most of the selected HOS features used for classification purposes are higher for normal subjects compared to diabetic subjects. This indicates that the HR signals of diabetic people are less complex than the HR of normal people. 5.2. Classifier performance parameters
Classifiers are trained to distinguish between normal and diabetic data. During the learning phase of the classifier, the classifier is fed with the values of the selected features of each class (i.e. normal and diabetic class) as input and the corresponding class label as output, and thus, the classifier is trained to understand the relationship between the input data and the output class label. Thus, each classifier is trained with features from both the classes in order to determine the classifier parameters that can be used to classify normal and diabetes classes. During the testing phase, these trained classifiers are further tested with test data inputs (of already known and confirmed classes) to see whether the classifier shows the correct label as output.

When an unknown input data is given to the trained classifier, it will predict the class (diabetic or normal) to which the data input belongs to, by showing the output label. The higher the value of the evaluation parameters of the classifier, the higher will be the probability of correct prediction of class by the classifier. Performance evaluation parameters namely, sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and accuracy were used in this study. Sensitivity is the p robability that t he test gives a positive result when abnormal features (i.e. features corresponding to diabetic patients) are tested. The Specificity of a test is the probability that a test gives a negative result when normal cases are tested. PPV is the probability that a patient with a positive test actually has a disease. Accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified samples to the total number of samples used.

For determining the values of these evaluation parameters, we calculated certain other parameters namely TP, TN, FP, and FN. In our context, positive implies diabetic (having disease) and negative implies normal (no disease). True Positive (TP) indicates the number of diabetic people for whom the result of the test is positive. False Negative (FN) is the number of diabetic people for whom the test results are negative. True Negative (TN) is the number of normal people for whom the test results showed negative, while False Positive (FP) is the number of normal people whose test results are positive. Table 2 gives a clear representation of these parameters.
 Sensitivity is ratio of True Positive (TP) to the total number of Positive cases (P). Sensitivity = TP/P = TP/(TP + FN). The definition of sensitivity gives it another name True Positive Rate (TPR). Specificity is ratio of True Negative (TN) to the total number of Negative (N) cases. Specificity = TN/N = TN/(TN + FP). Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(P + N). Here (TP + TN) gives the number of samples correctly classified. (P + N) which is in turn given by (TP + FN + TN + FP) gives the total number of samples (sum of number of diabetic data samples and normal data samples). PPV = TP/(TP + FP). We have seen that sensitivity is also called True positive rate (TPR) which is equal to TP/P where P = TP + FN. Similarly we can define False Positive rate (FPR) as FP/N where N = TN + FP. False positive rate is thus same as (1-specificity). 1  X  specificity = 1  X  (TN/(TN + FP)) = FP/(TN + FP) = FP/N = False positive rate. 5.3. Classifier performance results
To test the classifiers, three fold stratified cross validation method was used. The whole dataset was divided into three equal parts. During the first fold, two parts of the data were used as training data for developing the classifier. The remaining one part of the data was used as the test data, and the evaluation parameters, namely, Accuracy, PPV, Sensitivity, and Specificity were calculated. This procedure was repeated three times by using a different test set in each fold. The averages of the performance measures obtained in each fold were reported as the final performance measures. For our work, we have used a total of 142 datasets out of which, in every fold, 100 datasets were used for training and 42 datasets were used for testing. Table 3 shows the details of the training and testing dataset.

Table 4 gives the detailed summary of the evaluation parameters of all the classifiers evaluated in this work. The maximum accuracy of 90.5% is recorded by the GMM classifier while maintaining the second highest value for sensitivity and third highest values of PPV and specificity.

SVM classifier has the maximum value for two parameters (98.3% for PPV and 98.4% for specificity) with the second highest value of 86.5% for accuracy.

The NBC shares the second highest values for three parameters; 86.5% for accuracy, 96.8% for PPV and 96.8% for specificity.

Accuracy of the classifiers vary in the range 90.5% X 71.4%, the minimum value belongs to the Fuzzy classifier. Sensitivity varied in the range 92.1% X 65.1% with the maximum value for the DT classifier. Specificity varied in the range 98.4% X 69.8% with minimum value for the DT classifier.

From Table 4, it is evident that the GMM classifier has the best performance closely followed by SVM classifier and NBC. 6. Discussions
The correlation between fasting plasma glucose and cardiovascular complications has been clearly established by many early works [25,56]. The constraint of traditional measures to assess autonomic health is that they can document the presence of neuropathy only at a worsened state where neuropathy shows severe symptoms. In the 1970s, it was known that diabetes causes decreased beat-to-beat vari-ability during deep breathing [62]. It was also observed that diabetes patients who had negative results for traditional cardiac autonomic function tests showed a diminished HRV [49]. Other studies also em-phasized the fact that the cardiac (parasympathetic) autonomic activity was reduced in diabetic patients much before clinical symptoms of neuropathy are evident [49,55,60].

Heart rate variability has been used to investigate the autonomic modulation of heart rate. The analysis of HRV (taken from 24 hour ECG recordings) in time and frequency domains was studied [37]. They observed that in diabetic HRV samples, in time domain and frequency domain measures were markedly reduced ( p&lt; 0.05) compared to normal samples. Heart rate variation was measured at different rates of regular and deep breathing in normal and diabetic patients with neuropathy; heart rate variation was ob-served to be significantly smaller in diabetic patients with neuropathy compared to normal subjects [40]. A work was initiated with the objective of finding the critical threshold of diabetes duration which can produce a significant change (either in time or frequency domain) in HRV signals when compared to normal HRV signals. They found that HRV measures of patients having a longer duration of diabetes (5 years or more) were much different from those from patients having a lesser duration (3 or less) of diabetes. They also showed that HRV of newly diagnosed cases and those of patients who have been suf-fering from diabetes for up to three years were similar to the HRV recorded in non-diabetic cases [15]. Such studies clearly indicate the relationship between HRV and diabetes, and show that diabetes caused recordable changes in HRV signals. This led to the idea of developing non-invasive methods for the de-tection of diabetes, and several studies were conducted with the aim of developing such methods using different features extracted from the HR signals. Table 5 gives a summary of methods used for detecting the HRV parameters that were significantly different in diabetic patients.

Herbert et al. [36] have studied the effects of QT dispersion (QTd) and heart rate variability on a group of people with and without Type 2 diabetes and no recorded cardiac disease. They studied HRV in the form of a parameter called tone-entropy (T-E) where tone (T) represented sympatho-vagal balance and entropy (E) indicated the autonomic regularity. They found that there was a decrease in TE indicating a change in normal sympathetic-parasympathetic rhythm in diabetic people.

Awdah et al. conducted a study on a group of diabetic and normal people. All people were free of cardiovascular disease and had no previous history of ill health except diabetes in the case of diabetic people. They measured time domain variables like SDRR (standard deviation of RR interval), St. George index, SNN50 (count of the total number of differences between adjacent RR intervals that were greater than 50 ms), pNN50% (the proportion of NN50 divided by total number of NNs), RMSSD of these groups and came to a conclusion that all these parameters significantly decreased in all diabetic patients (with and without diabetic neuropathy) compared to the normal people [14].

Chemla et al. [19] have used autoregressive spectral and FFT-based analysis for the study of HRV signals in diabetic people. Emily et al. have shown that diabetic people had lower SDNN, RMSSD and R-R interval than non-diabetic people. Their conclusion was that these HRV changes in diabetic people suggested decrease in autonomic function in the early development stage of diabetes itself. Thus, they found that diabetes led to a progressive decline in autonomic function [26].

Seyd et al. analyzed HRV signals of equal number of diabetic and normal people by frequency and time domain methods. They found that time domai n parameters SDNN, RMSSD, NN50 (the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by more than 50 ms) count, pNN50 count, HRV triangular index, TINN (triangular interpolation of NN interval histogram), Mean RR interval had a decline for diabetic patients compared to normal ones. Frequency domain analysis showed significant difference in very low frequency (VLF) power, low frequency (LF) power and high frequency (HF) power between diabetes people and normal people [11].
 Robert et al. [52] talked about the consistent evidence which reinforces the fact that the duration of Types 1 and 2 diabetes is inversely related to the HRV measures of total RR variability and vagal-heart rate modulation.

Ahsan et al. have showed the importance of HRV analysis in detecting CAN in diabetic people. They have found that Poincare plots and Sample Entropy (SampEn) derived from HRV had great potential in discriminating diabetes-induced-CAN [12].

In all these works, time-domain analysis of parameters for the diagnosis of parameters for the diagno-sis of diabetes was performed [11,14,26,52]. These time-domain analyses involved statistical operations mainly calculations of mean and variance of the RR interval. Mean time-domain indices calculated were average Heart Rate, SDNN (also called SDRR) and RMSSD. The disadvantage of time-domain mea-surements is that they are easily affected by artifacts and outliers. Chemla et al. and Seyd et al. used frequency domain analysis methods for HRV signals. The frequency domain measures analyses VHF, LF and HF frequencies present in the HRV signal. The disadvantage of this method is that the reliability of the spectral measurements reduces with the reduction of signal power and signal-to-noise power [19, 52]. Another disadvantage of time and frequency domain analyses is that the features of bio-signals like HRV which are non-linear in nature cannot be examined correctly using second order statistical methods. HRV is a non-linear and non-Gaussian signal. Since HRV is a non-linear signal, non-linear techniques can be effectively used. A number of non-linear methods like Lyapunov exponent, 1/f slope, Approxi-mate Entropy (ApEn), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) have been proposed. But HRV signal is also non-Gaussian, in add ition to being non-linear. Hence higher o rder moments (of order greater than two) carry information. The advantage of HOS analysis is that it provides that extra vital information about the HRV signal.

The significance of HOS also lies in the fact that it is comprised of lot of parameters which can clearly capture different modulations of the HRV, and hence the diabetes HRV can be diagnosed easily. Also, HOS performs better when during weak and high noise signals. Another advantage is the easy employability of artificial intelligence and classification algorithms to HOS techniques.

The earlier works in Table 5 did not use classifiers for automating the process of diagnosis of dia-betes [11,14,19,26,36,52]. R ecently, Acharya et al. [4] , have proposed a diabete s integrated index (DII), one number evaluated from the mathematical equation made up of nonlinear parameters, that can differ-entiate normal and diabetes heart rate signals efficiently. In our study we have presented an automated method for distinguishing diabetic and non-diabetic people using HOS techniques applied to HRV sig-nals. We have also proposed unique bispectrum and bicoherence plots for normal and diabetes heart rate signals.

Also, HOS features were successfully used to differentiate normal, interictal and epileptic EEG sig-nals [21,22]. Also, Different ranges of bispectrum entropies and bispectrum invariants have been pro-posed for different cardiac arrhythmia [23]. They have also proposed unique bispectrum and bicoher-ence plots for different cardiac diseases. Using HOS features, five classes of cardiac conditions were successfully classified with an accuracy of 85.7%, sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 87.9% respec-tively [24]. This HOS method has been successfully applied to automated diagnosis of different stages of diabetes retinopathy [3] and glaucoma [2]. This method can be applied to other health care projects to improve the quality of life. 7. Conclusion and future work
Diabetes is a disease which has affecting a majority of human population. Once affected, diabetes cannot be cured. It can only be kept under control. Diabetes without proper control can lead to several other chronic diseases. Hence, early detection and efficient treatment mechanisms are of great impor-tance. Diabetes causes nerve disorders which can affect heart and heart rate. Here, in our work, we use Heart Rate (HR) signals (extracted from ECG signals) to detect diabetes with a high success rate. HRV analysis is used as a simple, non-invasive and reproducible detection tool of diabetes. We took the higher order spectrum of HR signals, extracted features, and then subjected these features to student X  X  t-test to select the significant features (whose p-values fall below a threshold value) which can distinguish normal and diabetic classes with high degree of accuracy. Subsequently, we used these selected features as input to a variety of classifiers. Depending upon the performance of these classifiers, we selected classifiers which show the highest performance in discriminating HR signals of diabetic and normal people. The maximum accuracy value of 90.5% was obtained for the evaluated GMM classifier. GMM classifier had also the high value of 95.8% for PPV, 95.2% for specificity and 85.7% for the sensitivity parameters.
The future work can be the development of a unique index which can clearly indicate the presence or absence of diabetics. The equation for the index can be developed from those selected features which vary by a multiple of two or more for normal and diabetic data. We can also fix a threshold value which separates the normal and diabetic data. Such an index will be extremely useful to non-engineering experts like doctors to use our proposed technique for efficient diabetes detection.
