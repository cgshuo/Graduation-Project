 M obile devices provide people with a conduit to the rich infor-mation resources of the Web. With consent, the devices can also provide streams of information about search activity and location that can be used in population studies and real-time assistance. We analyzed geotagged mobile queries in a privacy-sensitive study of potential transitions from health information search to in-world healthcare utilization. We note differences in people X  X  health infor-mation seeking before, during, and after the appearance of evidence that a medical facility has been visited. We find that we can accu-rately estimate statistics about such potential user engagement with healthcare providers. The findings highlight the promise of using geocoded search for sensing and predicting activities in the world. H .3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  search process, information filtering. M obile search; healthcare utilization; query logs. Mobile devices allow people to search the Web as the y travel and engage in the physical world. The devices can serve as large-scale sensor networks for population-wide studies of behavior and the environment. Mobile devices that sense location have the ability to provide information on connections between online activities and activities in physical world. In recent work, researchers demon-strated how a log of geocoded mobile queries could be harnessed in a privacy-sensitive manner to make inferences about how health search evolves into transitions in location that appear to represent healthcare utilization (HU) [9] . Other sources such as queries [2], blogs [5], and social media [6] have been used as spatiotemporal sensors, but none offer the clear relationship between virtual and physical spaces as do geocoded mobile queries. We show how such logs can be applied to extend prior studies and can provide new insights about healthcare utilization from mobile logs. Given estimates of HU events derived from mobile queries issued to a Web search engine, we identify and monitor the following: Search intent dynamics : Previous research has examined patterns of behavior with people X  X  health information seeking over time [8]. We show that mobile query logs can provide insights on search in-terests and concerns before patients arrive at a healthcare facility, as they wait or receive treatment, and after they depart. Population-level utilization analyses : Public organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compute statistics on healthcare utilization. We explore the possibility of us-ing mobile query logs to complement traditional tracking and mon-itoring as a low cost means of estimating the statistics of HU. Patient-specific predictions : We show that signals from mobile search logs can predict the duration of a forthcoming stay at medi-cal facilities, enabling such applications as patient triage. We first describe the procedure by which we estimate HU events from geocoded mobile query logs. We then present several differ-ent uses of these inferred visits. We characterize behavior before, during, and after an inferred visit, estimating visit statistics, and predicting the duration of a user X  X  stay at a medical facility. A key premise of our study is that we can identify w hen users are likely visiting healthcare facilities and/or engaging with healthcare professionals. We begin by describing the datasets we use in our study and the methods we used to infer utilization. We collected datasets with consent via a widely avai lable applica-tion provided by a major mobile search provider. The application runs on the Android and iPhone platforms. Users agreed to share their search activities and location information per a published pri-vacy statement, which grants uses of the data to the provider for internal analysis and service improvement. We used automated tools to process the data in the aggregate. In this process, all data were stripped of individually identifiable information. Direct loca-tion information was removed and not used in the analysis. We used a dataset spanning one year of activity from approximately 30K users who had agreed to share their search activities and loca-tion information. The log consists of several hundred thousand search entries stored on a secure server. Each entry corresponds to a search interaction with a mobile application issued by an anony-mized user, represented by a unique numerical identifier. Entries contain the search query, the time, and GPS location when the query was submitted. Location information was recorded only if and when a search query was issued. The absolute locations of users were removed. As in [9], only the distance between the user and the location of medical facilities was stored. To compute the dis-tances, we obtained the GPS coordinates of medical facilities across the United States through a crawl of business listings, which in-cludes data from a variety of sources such as the Yellow Pages (yp.com). The database of facilities contains 34,750 medical facil-ity sites. Site types include emergency medical and surgical ser-vices (54.7%), hospitals (34.1%), medical centers (10.5%), and out-patient services (0.6%). As we sought to understand long-term search patterns, we removed users with &lt; 90 days of search history. Research done during an internship at Microsoft Research. To identify searchers who may be utilizing medical facilities, we consider the spatial context in which a medical query was issued. We only consider whether people searched for medical information from within a certain distance (200 meters in our case) from a med-ical facility, following methods used and evaluated in [9]. In par-ticular, we consider non-periodic proximity to a medical facility as salient evidence of healthcare utilization (EHU). We further char-acterize engagements with healthcare facilities with information about whether the GPS signal was available; GPS is generally available outside but is often lost when indoors. We assume that searches may occur within a healthcare facility when a GPS signal is not attainable for a period of time (e.g., from 30 minutes to a few days) following observation of EHU. Types of engagements at a medical facility include seeking treatment, visiting an admitted pa-tient, and accompanying a patient. For simplicity we shall refer to all of these activities as healthcare utilization . In our data set, 5239 users (14.8% of the total number) queried from within 200 meters of the medical facility at least once, providing evidence of HU. Note that although the proximal query provides a useful way of es-timating HU, this mechanism may introduce population bias (e.g., these users may be younger or more technologically savvy). We seek to make inferences about HU from the log, which serves as a noisy and sparse sensor; we cannot completely resolve uncer-tainty about whether the EHUs as defined actually represent a visit or a true engagement. Given the nature of the logs, we were unable to distinguish between users visiting the medical facility for treat-ment, to visit or escort an admitted patient, or simply working at or traveling near the facility but not using its health-related services. To reduce the likelihood of errors, we require that users had previ-ously searched for at least one of a set of tracked symptoms or syn-onyms from the Merck medical dictionary in the 90 days before the EHU visit, demonstrating a health interest or concern. In total, 4006 of the 5239 users (76.5%) met this requirement. To improve the likelihood that observed EHU events were related to treatment and consultation, we removed the 885 users (22.1%) who had queried from within 200 meters of the facility in the time period before the first symptom query and who had queried frequently near a facility (where more than 30 of the 90 days of search activities occurred within 200m of a facility). These users may live near the facility, may work at or near the facility or be receiving long-term care at the facility, and would hence not be relevant to our focus on transi-tions from Web search to in-world healthcare utilization. Given an estimate for HU from mobile search logs, we analyze as-pects of this activity, specifically studying the dynamics of search intent surrounding the EHU visit. We now characterize intentions and seek to predict the duration for each inferred visit. We first explore the dynamics of health-related search goals that may be attributed to inferred HU. Specifically, as a user X  X  health condition evolves (e.g., from normal, to ill (or concerned about an illness), to recovered), or engagement status changes (e.g., from ap-proaching a facility, to engaging with a healthcare practitioner, to departing a facility), how is their search behavior affected? We tar-get the presence of the following health signals in mobile queries:  X  Symptoms. Symptom queries can capture the onset of medical  X  Body-part names. We use a list of major appendages and or- X  Benign and serious conditions. We also look for the presence  X  Healthcare utilization intentions (HUI). We also track que- X  Drugs. We define a set of common medications and monitor Queries are classified into one of these categories via a white-list-based string-match classifier. When a query has overlap with mul-tiple categories, we assign it to the category with highest overlap. For each searcher demonstrating EHU, we divide search sequences into three phases, i.e., before, during (i.e., user queries near a med-ical facility and the GPS signal is unavailable or  X  X ark, X  suggesting that they are indoors), and after the assumed HU. We track the dy-namics of the searcher X  X  intent by computing the fraction of their search queries on the aforementioned five categories in each phase. The average dynamics over all users with EHU are depicted in Fig-ure 1. The figure shows the fraction of all observed queries that fall into each phase before, during, and after the visit. For example, 0.1% of queries observed before and after the EHU contain symp-toms, but 0.18% of the queries during the visit are associated with symptoms. There are a number of noteworthy patterns in the termi-nological shifts between the three phases: 1. More searching symptoms and human anatomy when users are close to a medical facility (within 200m and GPS dark) than far away from it, suggesting that searchers have stronger interest and concerns about health when searching near a hospital. 2. There is a stronger interest in HUIs prior to the visit to the facility and this diminishes dramatically once the user reaches the facil-ity (dropping to nearly half the pre-visit level). Since the EHU is Figure 1. Search intentions before, during, and after assumed engagement with professional healthcare (data presented as based on the GPS location and not the query content, this transi-tion provides strong evidence of HU. 3. We observe changes in the mix of health-related search goals as people transition to different phases of engagement. In particular, users were observed searching significantly more often for con-ditions (doubled) before the assumed engagement than in the other phases, anatomical names (tripled) and symptoms (dou-bled) during engagement than other phases, and drug names (seven times higher) following the visit. 4. We believe that the transition from conditions and HUI (before engagement), to symptoms and body-parts (during engagement), and eventually to treatments and drug names (after engagement) reflects shifts in information needs over the course of healthcare engagement episodes. The mobile query logs appear to reflect patients moving from concerns and questions about their condi-tions, to those of diagnosis and symptoms, and eventually to treatments and post-visit recovery. Although these findings may be unsurprising, they show that sens-ing is to some extent reliable and highlight the potential value of geocoded query analysis for linking online intent with in-world use. We also examined how healthcare engagement influences search-ers X  medical concerns. As an example, we sought to understand how evidence of engagement with a healthcare professional might lead to signs of resolution of concerns. One way to do this is by examining if and how the frequency of question words (i.e., what, which, when, why, how, and who) in medical queries changes with the phase of the engagement. One might expect to see that users have more uncertainty and questions before, and perhaps during, the early portion of healthcare engagement than after it. We did not observe significant changes in the use of question words in mobile medical queries over the course of the engagement. One explana-tion is that while the engagement may address some concerns, it also raises others. We observed that queries issued during engage-ment were on average more technical than in other scenarios, sug-gesting that users may adopt terminology from discussions with healthcare professionals, or seek the meaning of specialist terms encountered. We shall investigate query technicality in more detail. We now consider estimations of durations of engagements at med-ical facilities. The primary focus in this analysis is in comparing the statistics obtained from the mobile search log to ground truth pro-vided by the CDC. The CDC statistics are based on outpatient rec-ords, collected from a range of medical facilities across the US. Since we only have access to location information when users enter queries, we are uncertain about exact time a user enters or leaves a facility. Figure 2 shows an example of a visit to a medical facility, defined in the figure as time period where the user X  X  GPS signal is dark (i.e., they are likely indoors). Assume the last query before engagement that the searcher issued when the GPS signal is avail-able (light) was at time t 1 , the first query when their GPS is una-vailable (dark) was at time t 2 , the last query issued at dark was at time t 3 and the first query after engagement issued when their GPS device first received a signal was at t 4 . Our estimate of start time t = ( t 1 + t 2 )/2, estimated end time t e = ( t 3 + t tion  X  t = t e  X  t s . The measurement error e = ( t relative measurement error E = e / X  t . To mitigate the measurement error, we perform explicit filtering by removing all EHU events whose relative measurement errors exceed 20%. The duration estimates that we obtain from our mobile search log analysis are provided in Table 1. Since the time that people spend at a facility is influenced by the type of facility (e.g., people may tend to spend more time in inpatient facilities than outpatient cen-ters), we split our analysis into urgent care facilities and hospitals. For reference purposes, the CDC statistics on durations at each of the two facility types are also provided [1]. We can clearly see from Table 1 that estimates of durations of engagement times from the mobile search logs resonate well with the CDC statistics. Given the accuracy with which we were able to estimate durations, we explored the use of predictive models to estimate the duration of an upcoming healthcare engagement based on a searcher X  X  pre-engagement search behavior. These predictive models might be used one day for assistance in clinically-relevant forecasting tasks, such as helping medical facilities triage patients before their arrival. The features we used in our predictions are listed in Table 2. We breakout EHU into any EHU (query proximal to a medical facility) and indoor EHU (query proximal to medical facility and GPS sig-nal has gone dark, suggesting that they are inside the facility at query time). Note that prior utilization or engagement features are computed using search activity &gt; 12 hours before each engagement to reduce the likelihood of overlap with the engagement itself. engagement, with measurement error based on queries ( X ).

Medical Search # previous indoor-EHU events # serious condition searches Prior Engagement Dynamics # unique benign conditions Others Prior Utilization Facility type Light One important feature that we mentioned earlier is query technical-ity, which captures the sophistication of the medical terminology used by a searcher. We implemented a query technicality estimator based on a statistical language model similar to the approach de-scribed in [10]. The technicality model was learned from a large corpus comprising medical documents from domains of different technicality (e.g., PubMed, MeSH, CDC, WebMD, and medical search queries issued on Bing.com). Technicality estimations for queries are not accepted if the confidence is low. The technicality estimator enables us to track the specificity of a searcher X  X  medical concerns over the course of HU. Figure 3 plots the temporal dy-namics of a searcher X  X  query technicality during an engagement. As a reference, the normal level of query technicality for each user (in-dependent of the visit) is also given as  X  X ll X  in Figure 3. We can see the visit to the facility influences query technicality, suggesting that there may be exposure to technical terminology at the facility that emerges in query streams. Technicality also trends slightly down-ward over time, suggesting that most of the effect on query behav-ior occurs within a short time of the visit beginning. One explana-tion is diagnoses may be rendered soon after arrival of the patient. A key challenge in our prediction is a lack of supervised data. We do not have access to the ground truth (e.g., the exact duration) of the potential engagements. For example, assuming a healthcare en-gagement for which the log-based estimation of duration is four hours with a measurement error of three hours, the true duration could be any value between one and seven hours. We know that we are grappling with substantial and unavoidable measurement errors. We cannot overcome the errors with our methodology. To make our prediction tractable, we removed engagement sessions with ex-cessive measurement errors. Particularly, we require that for each engagement, the start distance and end distance, i.e., the distances at which the searcher issued a query when the engagement started/ended, are at most 150m and one mile respectively from the facility. This restriction results in 179 EHU sessions, with an aver-age measurement error (defined in previous section) of 83.86%. The duration prediction task can be formulated naturally as a re-gression problem, i.e., given the features extracted from the pre-engagement search activities, we seek to predict the duration of an engagement. We experimented with two regression models with the 25 features (Table 2). We used a linear regression model with L2 regularization and a generalized linear model (GLM) with a re-ciprocal link function (i.e., assuming that the duration follows an exponential distribution rather than normal) and L2 regularization. The models were trained and tested based on a leave-one-out cross-validation, where the relative error compared to the estimated du-ration was used as the evaluation metric. The prediction results are reported in Figure 4. Promisingly, they show that the GLM attains a prediction accuracy close to the measurement error. To better un-derstand the engagement duration, Table 3 lists the top 10 most im-portant features and their weights (normalized against the most im-portant feature). The analysis shows that query technicality and pre-vious EHUs are the strongest predictors, but other features such as facility type and general medical searching are also important. Using geotagged mobile searches as sensors for healthcare utiliza-tion, we explore health seeking behavior and seek to identify en-gagements with professional health providers. We also use search activity to estimate durations of healthcare utilization for different facility types and find strong agreement with CDC statistics. We use mobile search logs to predict engagement durations, consider-ing medical search histories and prior engagement information. We are enthusiastic about the promise of the methods described in this paper, and envision privacy-sensitive applications that could pro-vide value in the healthcare domain and beyond.
