 Elena Zudilova-Seinstra  X  Tony Adriaansen With the rapid development of information technology, the amount and complexity of scien-tific data increase exponentially every day. The data explosion has led to very large detailed datasets and the amount of detail in these datasets continues to grow. Nowadays, the challenge is to harness the power of knowledge hidden in the collage of scientific data.

Visualisation technologies empower users to perceive important patterns in the data, iden-tify areas that need further scrutiny and make sophisticated decisions. However, looking at information is only the first step in understanding. For some domains, it is unclear what the features of interest are and how to define them in such a way that they can be detected. Many scientific discovery tasks can only be solved in interactive ways: by combining infor-mation analysis tools, advanced visualisation techniques and intuitive user interfaces. The importance of human interaction and perception cannot be ignored in the field of scientific computing and data analysis.

Interactive exploration systems allow people to examine scientific data and share obtained knowledge with, and through, information technology. These systems should be easy to use and not require sophisticated computer skills, as most of users are rather domain-specific experts than computer scientists. To increase users X  abilities to explore the data and better understand the results of experiments based on extensive calculations, new scientific methods need to be developed and applied.

This special issue combines papers that discuss how modern visualisation and interac-tion techniques can augment the information analysis cycle from the user X  X  perspective. The collected manuscripts are updated and expanded versions of papers presented at a series of international events related to topics of the interactive exploration and analysis of scientific data.

The issue opens with a paper by Cai et al. which presents the human X  X omputer visual inter-action approach to the data mining of complex spatio-temporal phenomena. In this project, multiple visualisations and human X  X omputer interaction techniques are tightly coupled and embedded in the simulated dynamic process. The case study of this research is the simulation of the algae formation based on the Bayseian Cellular Automata model.
 The second paper by Corrie and Storey is devoted to distributed scientific collaboration. Today X  X  scientific problems require a wide range of expertise. As a result, collaborative exploration and visualisation environments are becoming increasingly important tools for the scientific research community. They allow opinions to be shared, removing the data bottleneck of individual analysis and reducing the time to discovery. The paper explores the importance of gestures in distributed scientific collaboration, when remote collaborators work together using complex digital artefacts. Authors report results of an observational study and present quantitative analysis of gesture-based interactions during co-located and distributed scientific collaborations.

The third paper by Sas and Schmidt discusses a method for analysing trajectories followed by people while they perform navigational tasks in virtual environments. The maturing virtual reality (VR) techniques provide ground for new enabling tools addressing computer-supported activities. Quantitative analysis of user trajectories in a VR environment is an important topic in human factors studies, virtual reality technologies, medical evaluations and training. The spatial knowledge acquisition is of specific interest for this research, where the Bezier curve approximation has been chosen for the diagnosis of navigational patterns.

The next two papers of this issue deal with multi-modal interaction applied to the visuali-sation and exploration of scientific data.

The fourth paper by Kok and van Liere addresses an important topic of designing multi-modal user interfaces. Multi-modal user interfaces facilitate richer interaction styles for both information retrieval and analysis. Based on the combination of several interaction modalities (i.e., visual display, speech, gestures, direct manipulation, haptics, real time video and audio, etc.), multi-modal interfaces enable people X  X  interaction with the visual representations of phenomena and results of computer-based scientific experiments in a more intuitive and flex-ible way. The paper reports on novel methods for the 3D manipulation and depth perception in immersive VR, which enhance users X  spatial interaction with the visualised scientific data. A 3D interface extension to the Kitware Visualisation Toolkit is presented.

The fifth paper by Evreinova et al. introduces a novel approach to non-visual user inter-actions supported by direction predictive sounds and kinesthetic feedback. The non-visual interface techniques allow users X  interactions, which might be hard to achieve through the visual medium only. Audio and tactile feedback are the most important output modalities for visually impaired users. The paper presents two case studies suggesting that sonification can be used to support people to successfully inspect various graphical shapes in the absence of visual stimuli.

The last paper of this issue by Zudilova-Seinstra explores the importance of individ-ual human abilities in the design of adaptive user interfaces for scientific problem solving environments. Adaptive user interfaces allow an interactive exploration environment to auto-matically learn and adapt to important user, task and environmental parameters. The paper reports results of an experimental study suggesting criteria for the inclusion of investigated human factors into the user model of an adaptive interface.
