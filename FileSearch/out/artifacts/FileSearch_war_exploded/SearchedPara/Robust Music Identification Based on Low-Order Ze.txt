 In this paper, we devise a novel robust music identification algorithm utilizing compressed-domain audio Zernike moment adapted from image processing techni ques as the pivotal feature. Audio fingerprint derived from this feature exhibits strong robustness against various audio signal distortions including the challenging pitch shifting a nd time-scale m odification. Experiments show that in our test dataset composed of 1822 popular songs, a 5s music query example which might have been severely corrupted is still sufficient to identify its original near-duplicate copy, with more than 90% top five precision rate.

Music identification is a technique that uses audio fingerprint to recognize the near-duplicate original copy from a music database given an unknown input query example that might have been severely corrupted by various audio signal distortions. To date, a number of algorithms ha ve been published with rather high retrieval performance and most of them operate on the PCM wave format. However, with the mature of CD quality audio compression techniques a nd the fast growing of the Internet, it will be interesting and meaningful in practice if audio features are directly extracted from the compressed domain and used for music identification in the database. 
So far, only a few algorithms th at perform music information retrieval (MIR) directly on th e compressed domain have been proposed [1-5], research in this fi eld is still in its infancy. The above methods achieved certain retrieval achievements, while they didn't consider or obtain compellent results to the most central problem of audio iden tification, i.e. robustness. Moreover, previously used featur es principally follow the line of MDCT coefficient and its derived spectral energy. 
In this paper, we develop a new compressed-domain feature to achieve high robustness in audio fingerprinting based on Zernike moment which has been widely used in image related research fields. To the author s X  knowledge, this is the first attempt that Zernike moment is used for robust audio identification in the compressed domain. Experiments show that the fingerprint derived from lo w-order audio Zernike moments 
Generally speaking, low-order moments characterize the basic component of a signal, while hi gher order ones depict the high frequency details. Therefore we take the sum of Zernike moments of order  X 2 X  as the final feature and further derive the audio fingerprint sequence , see formula (2) and (3). 
The emphasis of this paper is to invest the effectiveness of this Zernike moment based co mpressed-domain audio feature. Therefore we perform straightforward exhaustive matching between the query example and thos e stored recordings using bit error rate (BER) as the similarity measure. We first set up a music database composed of 1822 distinct MP3 format popular songs (30s, 64kbps) and a corresponding fingerprint database. Query ex amples include 5s-long excerpts cut from selected database songs and their distorted copies. 
Next we need to determin e a reasonable BER threshold T under a specific false positive rate (FPR). Fingerprint bits are assumed to be random i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) and error bits are mo deled by normal distribution. In accordance to the method of reference [5], FPR equals 4.3907e-005 when 0.32 is set as the threshold, this is acceptable for practical applications , accordingly we use 0.32 as the boundary to distinguish whether two fingerprints are matched or not
Given 100 randomly chosen query examples, the top-1, 5, 10 retrieval precision rates with 0.32 as the BER threshold are averaged and shown in Figure 2. 
It can be seen that this proposed MDCT Zernike moment based fingerprint shows very good identification precision, even under severe audio signal processing like heavy lossy recompression, volume modulation, echo addition, noise interference and various frequency wrapping such as band-pass filtering, equalization, pitching shifting ( X 10%) etc. The only deficiency is that under pitch re served time-scale modifications (TSM), only  X 3% TSM can be resisted. This weakness is essentially caused by the fixed data structure of the MP3 compressed bit stream. In this case, implicit synchronization methods based on salient local re gions can X  X  be applied. The only way to resist serious time-domain desynchronization is to increase the overlap between cont agious slots and design more steady fingerprints, whereas the overlap has an upper limit of 100% (96% has been used in this paper) and discovering more powerful features is neither an easy work. 
Compared with other related compressed-domain algorithms in the introduction whose best t op-5 precision rate is 90% [4] under a relatively clean environment (no robustness results are reported in [1-4], and pitching shifting and TSM are not considered in [5] ), our algorithm obviously outperforms those methods with the top-5 precision rates bigger than 90% even under severe audio signal processing such as MP3 compression@32kbps, equalization,  X 10% pitch shifting and  X 2% time-scale modification etc. What is more important, previous arts are not actually working in the way of fragment
