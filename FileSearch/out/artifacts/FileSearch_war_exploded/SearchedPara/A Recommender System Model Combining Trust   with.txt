 With rapid development of Internet, more and more people use online systems to buy products and services (hereafter called items). However, with overwhelming amount of information about items available on the Internet, it is extremely difficult for users to easily find and determine what they would like to buy. Recommender systems aim to recommend the target users with the ite ms which are considered to have high pos-sibilities of meeting their preferences. 
Given a huge number of users making commercial transactions online and an even two major challenges: data sparsity  X  the average number of ratings given by users is often very small compared to the huge number of items, and cold start  X  the  X  X umb X  users who review few items and provide little information. It causes the problem that a recommender system cannot decide what sh ould be recommended to the target users since it can only directly access to the users X  opinions on a small proportion of items. Therefore, the data sparsity is now taken into account by many recommendation me-lack of sufficient information to justify their interests. The traditional solutions to the problems are to use a combination of content-based matching and collaborative filter-ing [21] . Recently, researchers have considered using trust to deal with them [10, 14] . 
Trust is an assumed reliance on some person or thing, namely, a confident depen-people and their social connections. 
In general, the key concepts considered in modeling recommender systems include social links (Trust) into account but ignore the relations among items, which are help-derived by topic maps in an integrated model of recommender systems. This model maintains three types of relationships. The first type is the trust relationships among users. The second is the rating scores given to items by users, expressing how much users like items. The third one is called relatedness of an item to a topic, representing how much the item belongs to this topic, which leads to the computation of similarity relations among items. We use Topic Maps to represent the third type of relationships. Topic Maps is defined as an abstract model for semantically structured, self-describing link networks laid over a pool of addressable information objects [13] . A topic map includes three key components : topics, associations, and occurrences [22] . Using these elements, topic maps can be built in many domains. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce the related work in re-commender systems, trust and Topic Maps in Section 2. Then in Section 3 we pro-pose our model based on trust and Topic Maps, and we novelly propose a method to propagate trust to determine users X  interests and to apply Topic Maps to consider the relationship between items. Then we introduce our datasets for experiments and ana-future research in the last Section. Many efforts have been put in studying and developing recommender systems, aiming to support users doing business online. The major ones include content-based me-tent-based methods, collaborative filtering methods and others. Recently, researchers users with items they might like. document frequency) method, a computation method reflecting how important a word more likely to prefer the same items. These methods have been extended to considera-tion of using the attributes of items (for similarity computation) and the ratings given to items by users (for users profile computation) in construction of recommendations [23] . However, the content-based methods suffer from some shortcomings. Such kind of methods usually needs to collect user profiles. This is a problem of privacy. What is more, the content-based methods may ca use overspecialized recommendations that only include items very similar to those of which the user already knows [3] . 
The CF method uses a database about users X  preferences to predict more items us-ers might like [4] . Papagelis et al. [19] propose a recommendation method based on new similarity values between two users in relation to the old similarity values, so as propose a recommendation algorithm based on an integrated diffusion method making generate recommendations. This method uses both the user-item relations and the collaborative tagging information to improve the algorithmic performance. The short-and face the sparsity problem and cold-start problem. 
The authors of [18] propose a method using a weighted combination to fusion rat-ings obtained by content-based methods and CF-based methods separately. The weights are adjusted based on the strength of both the content-based method and the CF-based method. As the number of users and ratings given by them increase, the CF-crowd via globally computing all the ratings. Melville et al. [17] propose an approach using a content-based predictor to enhance existing user data thereby to provide per-sonalized suggestions through collaborative filtering. The content-based predictor accepts the item with a high rating score and rejects the item with a low rating score. However, these methods ignore the important social information which can reflect users X  interest. 
Trust among users and reputation of users are becoming important and elementary issues in social networking study. As pointed out by Guha and Kumar et al. [8] , a user trust network is a fundamental buildings block in many of today X  X  most successful e-commerce and recommendation systems. The authors propose a framework of trust propagation schemes, which appears to be the first to incorporate distrust in a compu-tational trust propagation setting. This paper shows that a small amount of expressed trust or distrust information can be used to predict trust between any two people in the system with high accuracy. Ziegler and Lausen [27] introduce a classification scheme for trust metrics. They present some model constituents for semantic web trust infra-that it assumes all trust information is publicly accessible, which, in practice, is nearly impossible. Vydiswaran et al. [25] propose a trust propagation framework to compute number of downloads of inauthentic files in a peer-to-peer file-sharing network. This authors, which can be used to flag new contributions from low-reputation authors, or derive users X  interest. But these methods have a shortcoming that they fail to analyze the relationships among items. We will apply Topic Maps technology to model relationships between items. Topic use Topic Maps to organize and retrieve online information in the context of e-learning courseware. They think Topic Maps offers a standard-based approach for expert X  X  knowledge. This allows further reusing, sharing and interoperability of knowledge and teaching units between courseware authors and developers. Dong and Li [6] propose a new set of hyper-graph operations on XTM (XML Topic Map), called HyO-XTM, to manage the distributed knowledge resources. In the HyO-XTM, the set of vertices is the union of the vertices and the hyper-edges X  sets of the hyper-hyper-edges of the hyper-graph. The hyper-graph model matches the Topic Maps with Hyper-graph vertices mapping to topic nodes and edges mapping to association nodes. Topic Maps is shown to be a new way to graphically manage the knowledge. relationships among items of recommender systems, so as to be aware of the relation-ships of items. We propose a graphical conceptual model for recommender systems, in which we model we also consider three types of relationships: trust (from one user to another), rating (from a user to an item), and belonging (from an item to a topic), see Fig. 1. 3.1 Model Description We use a user graph (, ) GV E to model the user trust network, where V is a set of user denote the trust value. We define a truster function of a user node v , yielding the set tion, denoted as  X  (v) , taking values from [0, 1]. 
Now we consider this type of relationships: rating R , from the user node set V to the item node set I . Each element (,) vi R  X  is an edge from a user who rates the item 
According to the concept of Topic Maps, an item is an occurrence which belongs to tt  X  to represent the association degree between two topics t real number in [0, 1]. The higher the value is, the closer the two topics are. 3.2 Topic Maps Based Trusted Recommendation Methods Using Topic Maps, we conceptually describe users, items, and topics, as well as vari-ships. 3.3 Trust Model In the trust model, the trust relationships among users are the basic ones, from which we derive users X  reputations and propagate new trust relationships among users. The tionships to v from other users, i.e. relationships. For simplicity, we only consider to propagate trust relationships but not tionships among users and dashed lines to represent the derived trust relationship. The propagation and that between v 1 and v 5 can be derived in the second single transitivi-nal trust value (, ) edges in the original trust network. 214 Z. Yu et al. 
For example, to derive a new trust value from the user node v 1 to the user node v 4 , there might be a number of paths, where a path means a chain of edges from v 1 to v 4 to derive the trust value: step of the single step transitivity. The formula above gives a new trust value in [-1, 1] parameter s to control the number of steps for trust propagation. 3.4 Deriving Users X  Opinion Based on the User Trust Network In this section, we discuss how to generate a rating value between a user and an item rating values from the existing ratings given by the users to the items to derive users X  new opinions on items together with new rating values. We denote the newly generat-users X  opinion on items through rating on the items from the intermediate users if they lowed to give advices to others. The newly generated rating relationships with rating values are computed by the function (,) (, ) ( ,) () () n  X   X   X   X  X   X  3.5 Deriving User X  X  Opinion Based Topic Maps In section 3.4 we generated a new set  X   X  of rating relationships using trust propaga-contains a lot of isolated clusters, the trust values and rating values from one cluster would not be possible to be used for other clusters. We call this the isolated trust clus-ter problem and will further explain it in section 4.1. 
Here we consider using the Topic Maps to solve this problem. We use the topic map to derive users X  opinion on topics. To do so, we first define a function g(v, t) to be an belonging to the topic t , as follows: g v t v i item v occurrences t  X  association rule for building the associatio n relationships between topics, because the analysis and navigation paths within websites [24] . We define a function (,) mn tt  X  have rated the topics, as follows: We set a threshold, denoted as confidence  X  , to be used in filtering out the associa-tions with value less than the threshold. The associations after filtering can be used to derive users X  opinion on a topic which they did not rate. The computation formula is as follows: Finally, we consider how to decide a user X  X  opinion on an item through both trust and trust network. opinion by themselves on an item, i.e., the weight of user X  X  own opinion. discuss the experiments and their results. 4.1 Dataset We use a data collection of the real review data from Epinions.com, provided at Mas-216 Z. Yu et al. (and their values) between users and the users X  ratings on items (and their values). In obtained by the method described below:  X 
Extract all the users in the first dataset and select 100 different users.  X 
Extract all the trust relationships among the 100 users. We obtained a subset, called subset 1. It contains 110 trust relationships, 82 of which have trust value 1 and 28 have trust value -1.  X 
Extract all the ratings given by the 100 users in the second dataset. We first obtain sampling the ratings, we obtain the subset 2. It contains 10141 ratings, with 8858 items and 34 users. The subset 2 has 6 different levels of rating values and 27 top-ics. As shown in Figure 3, most items are rated 5 and 4. Only a small proportion of them are rated 1, 2, 3 and 6. From the sample datasets we constructed for the experiments, we clearly observe the There are 10141 ratings for 100 users and 8858 items in this recommender system. So 10141/(100*8858)= 1.14%. Only one out of 100 users rated some items, so there are more than 98 cold start users. The maximum ratings for one user is 7507, on average every user 101 ratings. The trust relationships in the subset 1 form a user trust network, as shown in Fig. 4. We use the trust propagation method discussed in section 3 to obtain more trust rela-tionships. But this user trust network consists of many  X  X solated trust clusters X . They do not connect to each other and contribute lit tle to the trust propagation computation. 4.2 Results We use MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MAUE (Mean Absolute User Error) [15] to evaluate our recommendation method, because the MAE is the most commonly used and the easiest to be understood, and based on MAE, the MAUE provides the aver-ages of evaluation.
