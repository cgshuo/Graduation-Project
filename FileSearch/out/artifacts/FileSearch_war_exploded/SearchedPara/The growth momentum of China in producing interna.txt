Because of its rapid growth in science China has become a hot research object and this from various perspectives. In addi-tion to studies on the general situation of Chinese science (e.g., Leydesdorff &amp; Wagner, 2009a; Moed, 2002; Plume, 2011; Wagner &amp; Wong, 2011; Zhou &amp; Leydesdorff, 2006 ) and international collaboration ( Wagner, 2008; Zhou &amp; Gl X nzel, 2010 ), also regional performance in science has been investigated ( Zhou, Thijs, &amp; Gl X nzel, 2009 ). After China became the second largest producer of scientific papers in 2006 ( Zhou &amp; Leydesdorff, 2008 ), researchers were curious on if and when China would take over the USA in science production ( Leydesdorff, 2011; Leydesdorff &amp; Wagner, 2009b; Moed, Plume, Aisati, &amp; Berkvens, 2011; Shelton &amp; Foland, 2009 ). Regarding which year that China might surpass the USA in terms of scientific pro-ductivity, predicted years vary from 2014 ( The Royal Society, 2011 ) to 2020 ( Adams, 2010; Shelton &amp; Foland, 2009 ) or after-wards ( Leydesdorff, 2011, 2012 ). Although the predictions were based on either Scopus of Elsevier or the Web of Scienc eof Thomson Reuters, it seems that the year 2020 is a critical divide.

Related predictions were based on the assumption that China would continue to progress with its current pace. Such an assumption, however, might be challenged by China X  X  recent productivity of international publications. After continuous growth for over 20 years, the number of Chinese international publications dropped down significantly in 2010 ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Although publication productivity increased again in 2011, such a growth rate was still far from reaching those prior to 2010. By the retrieval date (i.e., November 7, 2012), China had 195815 and 213131 publications indexed in the SCIE and the CPCI-S for the years 2009 and 2011 respectively, which is only 8.8% increase in 2 years. Such a growth rate was much lower than those before 2010, for instance, the growth rate from 2008 to 2009 was 17.9%.

On the contrary, productivity of the USA had kept growing most of the time although losing its world share for years ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). As the top two largest scientific publication producers of the world, China X  X  drop in world share implies the rise of the USA. The fast growing speed of China prior to 2009 had been narrowing the gap with the USA. However, the sudden drop of  X 
China in 2010 slowed down the pace with which the gap between China and the USA narrows and might even result in enlargement of the gap ( Fig. 1 ).

USA might imply a changed growth momentum of China. Publication productivity can be affected by many factors such as database inclusion, evaluation policies, as well as R&amp;D investment in terms of expenditure and size of research personnel. In the situation of China, none of the mentioned factors have yet encountered a negative change: Growing number of Chinese journals has been included in the Web of Science ; research evaluation policies continue to encourage publishing internation-ally; R&amp;D investment have persistently increased and will continue to rise with the GERD/GDP ratio reaching 2.50% by 2020 ( The State Council, 2006 ); China has one of the world X  X  biggest reservoirs of R&amp;D personnel and will surpass the USA and the European Union in number of researchers shortly ( UNESCO, 2012 ).
 slowed down growth momentum of international collaboration and the slowing down increase of the number of researchers capable of publishing international papers. It has been proved that international collaboration can raise productivity (cf.,
NSB, 2010; The Royal Society, 2011 ) and visibility ( Aksnes, 2003; Katz &amp; Hicks, 1997; Narin, Stevens, &amp; Whitlow, 1990; Zhou &amp; Gl X nzel, 2010 ). When the contribution of international collaboration to Chinese overall productivity decreased ( Zhou &amp; Gl X nzel, 2010; Zhou &amp; Zhong, in press ) the growth momentum of Chinese international publications might be affected.
Encouraged by research evaluation policies in the previous years, capable Chinese researchers shifted from domestic to inter-national publishing and thus resulted in dramatic and continuous increase of Chinese publications indexed in international databases like the Web of Science and Scopus . After years of such shift, however, the growth rate of number of researchers capable of publishing international papers had slowed down, which lead to China may not be able to keep productivity grow as previous years. Of course, publication data in one or 2 years are not enough to support a strong conclusion. Further obser-vation is still needed.
