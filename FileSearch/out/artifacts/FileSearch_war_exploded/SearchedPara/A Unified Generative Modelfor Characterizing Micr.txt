 Microblog services, such as Twitter, Si na Weibo,and etc., have become one of the most popular social media. According to Infographics Labs 1 ,everydayin 2012 from Twitter 2 , 1 million new users are registered, and 175 million tweets are generated on average. From the statistics from Marketing Land 3 , 32% of the Web users are using Twitter. The revenue obtained from the advertising service is predicted to be 540 million US dollars by 2014 4 . People use microblog services to broadcast information, have conversations, and provide comments [7,8,12]. Due to their impacts on the Web, many data mining services are conducted on this new kind of social media, such as theme evolutionary analysis, public sentiment analysis, and etc. Topic analysis of microblogs is the fundamental problem for all these up-level services. Thus it has attracted much attention from both industry and academia [6,10,11,14,15].

In this paper, we focus on the issue of characterizing the microblogs X  topics based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [1]. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of a microblog from Twitter. UserA posts six tweets. All the tweets are about events happened in the Iranian election in 2009. We utilize the 5 th tweet,  X  X  UserB It is crime. just crime!!.. X , as an example. This tweet talks about a violent demon-stration event during the Iranian electio n period. An ideal cha racterizing model would project this microblog to the topic r elated to  X  X rime, Iran, election, demon-stration X , as shown in the Ideal-LDA table. In the table, four topics are shown. All of them are about the topic  X  X rime X  , which is the keyword occurred in the original microblog. But the other three (such as  X  X eneral political crime X ,  X  X il-itary crime X , and  X  X ublic safety X ) are not relevant to the demonstration event. Thus in an accurate topic analysis system, these three topics would not be as-signed for the microblog. We utilize the red color to denote large assignment probability value; the pink color to denote the medium probability value; and the white color to denote the small probability value.

Different from traditional social textual media (such as news documents) which could be modeled well by the original LDA model [1], microblogs have three characteristics, which makes modeling their topics a challenging task. 1) Too much noise . The rate of noise words in microblogs is much higher than that in news documents. Such noise words include the stopword, the symbol, and etc. In our example, among the seven words (  X  UserB  X ,  X  X t X ,  X  X s X ,  X  X rime X ,  X  X ust X , X !! X ,  X .. X ), only the word  X  X rime X  has a practical meaning for topic anal-ysis. 2) Short text . As indicated from the name  X  X icroblog X , the length of the text is much shorter than that in news documents. From the statistics in Twit-ter 5 , most microblogs have less than 28 characters. 3) Content incomplete-ness . Since social network is playing an important role in microblogs, many texts are not self-contained. Instead, they rely on other texts in the social network by the relation of @users, re-tweets, and e tc. Take the same example in Fig. 1, the tweet links UserB . From the tweets of UserB in the same time period, it could be inferred that the crime in the original tweet refers to the violent demonstra-tion in the Iranian election. However, th e original tweet itself does not contain the complete information. In summary, these three characteristics of microblogs make the original LDA model fail to work. We illustrate the result from the original LDA model in the Original-LDA table. It shows that the topics are not accurately modeled and assigned.

Although previous work overcomes some of these challenges separately, there are rarely any methods breaking all these limitations simultaneously. In the Content-LDA model [10,11], to solve the noise limitation, the non-content infor-mation is filtered by a prior classification process. Consequently, as shown in the Content-LDA table, the topics are model ed with much less noise. But since the text is too short and incomplete, the model cannot identify that the microblog is related to the demonstration event in Iranian election. Thus all the four topics related to  X  X rime X  would be assigned. I n the User-LDA model [15], to solve the short text limitation, it utilizes the user X  X  whole microblog set to enhance the calculation accuracy of each microblog X  X  topic distribution. As shown in the User-LDA table, according to the user X  X  history, two non-relevant topics are filtered out, and only the other two, the demonstration in Iranian election and politi-cal events, are retained. However, it ca nnot further identify the demonstration event. In the Social-LDA model [14], to solve the content incompleteness limi-tation, when modeling the topic for a microblog, the texts in both the original microblog and the linked users are considered. As shown in the Social-LDA table, by referring the tweets from UserB , the demonstration event could be identified for the word  X  X rime X  in the original microblog. But as more information is inte-grated, some non-relevant information would be also added, which would confuse the model. Thus by considering the social network alone, the topic would also not be modeled accurately. In addition, n oise exist in topics generated by the User-LDA model and Social-LDA model. We summarize the comparisons among different previous methods in the table in Fig. 1. It can be concluded that none of these methods overcomes all the limitations simultaneously. This motivates us to combine the ideas of all these methods into a unified topic model.
In this paper, we make combination of the ideas from the above three meth-ods, and propose a unified generative model for characterizing microblogs X  topics. This model could simultaneously solve the above three problems of microblogs, including noise, short text, and content incompleteness, in order to enhance the performance of modeling the topics. The main contribution lies in that we propose the generative process for the unified combination model, which is called  X  X ombination-LDA X , and derive a collapsed Gibbs-sampling optimiza-tion method for estimating the parameters. Through experimental verification on the Twitter dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach from both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. The proposed approach out-performs the above three methods significantly based on the metrics of log-likelyhood and perplexity. Topic models for traditional media have been well developed, from the La-tent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [3], to the probabilistic Latent Semantic Index-ing (PLSI) [5], and finally to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA)[1]. Topic modeling for microblogs, however, is a r ecent research task. Three representa-tives include the Content-LDA [10], the User-LDA [15], and the Social-LDA [14]. Other work include [2,6,8,9,12].

The generated process of the Content-LDA is shown in Fig. 2 (left). It extends the LDA by incorporating the supervision of a layer of labels, denoted by  X  , which is set beforehand. A prior classification is conducted in this model. It classifies the words into four categories, including the substance word, the status word, the style word, and the social word. In this way, the topic distribution is calculated with words of non-content categories filtered out.

The generated process of the User-LDA is shown in Fig. 2 (middle). It extends the LDA by incorporating the user X  X  tweet history. Each user has a distribution over all the topics, which is denoted as  X  u . The distribution is generated from his whole micorblog set. Then for each microblog, the topic of each word is assigned based on both the user X  X  topic distribution and the microblog X  X  topic distribution.
 The generated process of the Social-L DA is shown in Fig. 2 (right). It extends LDA by utilizing the user X  X  social relationships. Similar to the User-LDA model, each user has his own topic distribution. Each microblog has a set of linked neighbors from the social network, denoted by C . If the microblog contains @ relationships, its topic would be influenced by two parts, the content itself and the topic distribution from the social network. The glossary of notations used for the model is shown in Table.1. Fig. 3. presents the probabilistic graphic model of the Combination-LDA.

Like the traditional LDA model, it is assumed that there is a word distribution  X  k corresponding to each k latent topic, and they follow the Dirichlet distribution with the prior  X  as It can be observed from Fig. 3, the topic distribution of each microblog is influ-enced by four aspects. The part of the micr oblog content itself is essential. They follow the Dirichlet distribution with the hyper-parameter  X  d as The other three parts are breaking micorblogs X  three limitations as follows.
To solve the noise problem, we set labels manually. According to [10,11], we set three labels, the content word, the stopword, and the symbol. For each microblog d ,thesetoflabels  X  d k is characterized by the hyperparameter  X  k as Following the prior classification method in [10], we assume that the topic of a microblog is chosen from the subset of those labels, and each word w in microblog d is generated from a word distribution associated to one of that microblog X  X  labels. In this way, the non-content words would be filtered out. To overcome the short text limitaion, we assume that the topic distribution of a microblog has strong relationships with the user X  X  whole microblog set. For each user u ,a Dirichlet distribution with K latent topics is modeled as For each microblog, if it has @ relationships with other users, we believe the microblog topic is related to this set of neighbors X  microblogs. The topic distri-butions of the neighbors is modeled as After these analyses,  X  ( d ) for each microblog is generated by a linear combination of the aspects as with the constraint that  X  1 +  X  2 +  X  3 =1.

The aspect of noise filtering is conducted as a prior stage before. Thus it does not occur in this combination. A normalization is conducted after the combination.
Based on the  X  ( d ) , we suppose that the microblog has N d words. And each word i in { 1 , ..., N d } is generated in a similar way to the LDA model.
Specifically, draw a topic z first from the topic mixture over the microblog labels and then draw a word w i from the z i topic-word distribution The topic for the word is based on the distribution of all known and hidden variables given the hyperparameters as
The topic distribution for a microblog is calculated by a linear combination of three parts as We use Gibbs sampling to train the model.
 For microblog d , the posterior probability for its topic assignment would be where n d k,  X  i is the number of words (except the i th word) in microblog d that are assigned to topic k .

Similarly, for user u , the posterior probability for its topic assignment would be where n u k,  X  i is the number of words (except the i th word) in user u that are assigned to topic k .
 The topic distribution from the social network aspects is calculated as Therefore, for the i th token in the d th microblog for user u , the conditional posterior for its latent topic would be After the sampling process, the p arameters are estimated as In this section, we make the experimen tal verification on the performance of the proposed approach. Both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis are conducted. In the qualitative analysis, we utilize the same example in Fig. 1 to demonstrate that the proposed model have all the advantages of the previous methods intuitively. In the quantitative analysis, we evaluate different methods under the metrics of log-likelihood and perplexity. We show that the proposed approach could consistently outperform the previous methods at a significant scale. 5.1 Experimental Setup We utilize the SNAP [8,13] dataset from Stanford as our dataset. This dataset is collected from Twitter, from June 1 st 2009 to June 30 th 2009. The original dataset is in large scale. Following the ideas in [10], a subset is extracted for the calculation convenience. We retain the most active users in the extracting subset. For the original dataset, an approximate optimization approach could be utilized in the collapsed Gibbs-sampling [15], which could obtain competitive results from the precise approach. The subset contains 585 users with 107 , 519 microblogs.

Some statistics are shown in Fig. 4. To show how noisy the microblogs X  texts are, we divide the words in each microblog into content words and noise words. The noise words include the stopword, the symbol, and etc. The rate of content words in each microblog is calculated, and the distribution is drawn in Fig. 4 (a). It follows the Gaussian distribution. From the figure, it could be obtained that in most cases, 50% of the words in each microblog are noise words, which is in a large percent. To show how short the microblog X  X  length is, we draw the distributions of microblogs X  length in Fig. 4 (b). It follows the Gaussian distribution. The average number of words is only 5. We also draw the number of content word in each user X  X  blog history as shown in Fig. 4 (c). It follows the power-law distribution, indicating that most users have only a few content words. Finally, we also draw the distribution of how many friends each user @ in history in Fig. 4 (d). It also follows the power-law distribution. Most users have linked less than 50 friends.
We choose four previous methods for comparisons, including the original LDA model [1], the Content-LDA model [10], the User-LDA model [15], and the Social-LDA model [14]. In the configuration of filtering noise words, following the work in [10], we set three labels, including the content word, the stopword, and symbols (URLs, emoticons, punctuations, and hashtags). 5.2 Qualitative Analysis Fig. 5 shows the qualitative analysis of the proposed approach. The results come out as we expected in the first section. Due to the noise, the short text and content incompleteness, the original L DA model performs the worst. The gener-ated topics have a lot of noise, and the topics are not accurately extracted and ap-parently assigned. Although the Content-LDA, the User-LDA and the Social-LDA overcome some of the limitations separately, the information are not sufficiently utilized. Therefore, it is hard for the model to choose from the top two or three topics. The proposed combination model performs the best. It maps the microblog precisely to the topic of the demonstration event happened during the Iranian elec-tion. This example demonstrates intuitiv ely the effectiveness of the combination. 5.3 Quantitative Analysis In the quantitative analysis, we utilize the log-likelihood and perplexity to eval-uate the effectiveness of the models in ch aracterizing microblogs X  topics. The detailed definition of the metrics could be found in [4]. For the log-likehood, the larger the value, the better the performance; and for the perplexity, the smaller the value, the better the performance. We conduct the experiments in different configurations. The latent topic number is set to 30, 50, and 70, respectively.
Fig. 6 shows the quantitative analysis results. It could be obtained that in all the configurations, the proposed model consistently outperforms the other meth-ods at a significant scale. This demonstr ates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It overcomes all the three limitations of microblogs, including noise, short text, and content incompleteness. The Content-LDA, the User-LDA, and the Social-LDA overcome one limitation each, thus they outperform the original LDA.

We also conduct the sensitivity analysis for the parameters of  X  1 ,  X  2 ,and  X  3 in Eq. 14. The result is shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7 (a), the proportion of microblog content is range from 0.1 to 0.9, and the other two parameters divide the left proportion equally. Similarly, Fig. 7 (b) shows the result of changing the proportion of user topic distribution, and Fig. 7 (c) illustrates the result of changing the proportion of @user. It could be observed that there is a peak in all the figures. Both large value and small value would reduce the performance. The model is not sensitive to the parameters when they are between 0 . 3and0 . 7. In this paper,we propose a unified generative model for characterizing mi-croblogs X  topics. It combines the advantages of three previous models. We also derive a collapsed Gibbs-sampling optimization method for estimating the pa-rameters. Through both qualitative and quantitative analysis in a real world dataset from Twitter, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can effec-tively overcome the three challenges of modeling microblogs, including 1) too much noise, 2) short text, and 3) content incompleteness.
