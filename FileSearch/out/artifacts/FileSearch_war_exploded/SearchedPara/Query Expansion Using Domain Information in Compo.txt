 Compounds are semantic units containing at least two content-bearing morphemes. They function as one word, and are, in many languages, written as one word. In Swedish newspapers around 10% of the words have been found to be compounds (Hedlund, 2002). Since a compound has at least two content-bearing morphemes, a great part of the information is contained in the compounds, information which can be essential in retrieving relevant documents.
I will study medical compounds, examining pos-sible ways to expand queries in information retrieval using domain information. This information will guide the decision of when to include compound parts in search queries. The hypothesis is that com-ponents from the same domain as the compound it-self, in this case the medical domain, will increase the effectiveness of the search, while components from other domains or standard language will not. Information retrieval is about storing and orga-nizing documents so that they can be found and retrieved when relevant to an information need (Baeza-Yates, and Ribiero-Neto, 1999). The words of the documents are stored in indexes. The user poses a query to the system containing words de-scribing the information need. Words in the queries are matched against the indexed words. A ranking function finally ranks the documents in order of cal-culated relevance. The better the match, the higher a document is ranked.

The goal of information retrieval is to retrieve as many documents relevant to an information need as possible, high recall , and to have as low proportion of irrelevant documents in the output as possible, high precision . 2.1 Query expansion Query expansion is modification of a query to im-prove retrieval effectiveness. This can be done by changing or increasing the term content of a query.
In my work the strategy of expanding queries con-taining compounds, with selected compound com-ponents, is discussed. The strategy should result in higher recall, since more documents are likely to be retrieved. There is, however, a risk of lower preci-sion, since irrelevant documents with certainty also will be retrieved. To minimize the decrease of pre-cision, only components from the same domain as the compound itself will be used. Here, dealing with medical compounds, the objective is to decide if the components are from the medical domain. A compound is, as mentioned above, a semantic unit with more than one content-bearing morpheme. In Swedish, compounding is a very productive mor-phological process. There is an infinite number of possible compounds, so it is impossible to list them all. They are also written as one word without the boundary between the parts marked in any way. 3.1 Compositional/non-compositional Occasional compounds, not lexicalized but con-structed when needed, usually have a transparent meaning, where the meaning can be derived from the meaning of the parts. These are called composi-tional compounds . Other compounds, with a mean-ing that has strayed from the combined meaning of the components, are called non-compositional compounds (Hedlund, 2002). Non-compositional compounds are often lexicalized with a fixed mean-ing. An example of a lexicalized non-compositional compound is tr  X  adg  X  ard  X  X ree yard X , Swedish for  X  X ar-den X , not necessarily a garden containing trees.
In information retrieval, compositional and non-compositional compounds are best treated in differ-ent ways. Non-compositional compounds are often found in dictionaries and can be processed as they are. Using the components in queries would not ben-efit the result. If a query contains a compositional compound, the compound components might very well be used to expand the query, since they build up the meaning of the whole. 3.2 Decomposition not always beneficial When expanding queries with compound compo-nents, to increase recall, it is important to be aware that this could result in lower precision. This might be the case if the compound is non-compositional or if the parts are too general or used in other do-mains. In Ahlgren (2004) the author gives exam-ples of when decomposition of compounds is use-ful and when it is not. For a compound such as fotboll  X  X oot ball X  (soccer), expanding a query with fot and boll would probably result in lower preci-sion. On the other hand, expanding a query contain-ing the compound narkotikapolitik  X  X rug politics X , with narkotika and politik would probably be more useful. Documents containing phrases like politik mot narkotika  X  X olitics against drugs X  could be re-trieved. Documents containing narkotika or politik alone would also be found. Here one can speculate that documents containing narkotika have a good chance of being relevant, while the concept politik is broader and could cause retrieval of many irrele-vant documents.

My idea is to expand queries containing medi-cal compounds by selecting components that also belong to the medical domain. Take the com-pound korsband  X  X ross band/tape X  (cruciate liga-ment). Both parts belong to standard language. Including them would do more harm than good. In the case of  X  aderbr  X  acksstrumpa  X  X aricose-veins stocking X  the component  X  aderbr  X  ack seems to be a good candidate for query expansion, unlike strumpa , which belongs to standard language. One way to determine which compound parts be-long to the medical domain is to use a medical thesaurus, a controlled vocabulary with words or-ganized according to conceptual relations. I have used the Swedish MeSH (Medical Subject Head-ings) (Svensk MeSH, www), which is based on a translation of the original American MeSH (MeSH, www). 4.1 The MeSH tagger A Swedish MeSH tagger (Kokkinakis, 2006) is be-ing developed at Spr  X akdata, Department of Swedish Language, G  X oteborg University. The tagger tags maximal length strings from six subdomains of the Swedish MeSH: A : Anatomy, B : Organisms, C : Dis-eases, D : Chemicals and Drugs, E : Analytical, Diag-nostic, and Therapeutic Techniques and Equipment, and F : Psychiatry and Psychology. If a string is tagged, the tagger will not mark a substring of this string unless it is from another subdomain. The tag-ger does not tag any substrings shorter than five let-ters.

In the Swedish MeSH the compound kransart  X  ar  X  X reath artery X  (coronary artery) is not listed, thus it is not tagged. On the other hand art  X  ar is found and tagged accordingly. The word krans is not a medical term. It is not included in MeSH and consequently not tagged: 4.2 Expansion using MeSH As mentioned above, one expansion strategy for queries containing medical compounds is to add do-main specific parts of the compounds to the query. This should work with compositional compounds. An example is patellaluxation  X  X atella dislocation X  (dislocation of the knee cap). Chances are that doc-uments containing any or both of the simplex words patella and luxation will be relevant to the needs of a user including patellaluxation in a query.
Expanding queries with components not from the domain, especially those common in standard lan-guage, will probably result in lower precision. In the example kransart  X  ar the strategy would be to keep the original compound, add art  X  ar which is found by the MeSH tagger, but not krans which is not tagged. To test the MeSH tagger, a run was made with 5205 compounds extracted from the on-line med-ical lexicon Medlex (Kokkinakis, 2004), created at Spr  X akdata, Department of Swedish Language, G  X oteborg University. Medlex was created by adding medical vocabulary to a learner X  X  dictionary, thus a great part of the compounds in Medlex are from the medical domain. 895 of the 5205 compounds were tagged. Among compounds not tagged, around 10% were medical. This figure should improve with a more comprehen-sive tagger. 233 compounds which were not tagged as a whole, had one or two components correctly tagged. This is where the strategy described should be most beneficial, suggesting that an expanded query con-tain the compound itself and the tagged substring(s).
Examples of tagging which may improve effec-tiveness in query expansion, are shown below: 63 compounds had tagged components not used in medical senses. Those strings were homonymic, polysemic, or had several facets. Homonymy is when a string represents different words that by chance are alike. Polysemy is when one word has several meanings. For example, the  X  X eg X  of a person and the  X  X eg X  of a table. Facets are different aspects of one concept. A  X  X erson X  has a body aspect as well as a personality aspect (Croft and Cruse, 2004).
It is tagging of words that are homonymic, poly-semic, or with medical and non-medical facets that I predict will cause difficulties. An example is h  X  astansikte  X  X orse face X . Although ansikte is a med-ical term, it is not used in a medical sense here. If you say that a person has a h  X  astansikte it is a com-ment about looks, not health. The word ansikte has a medical facet, but also a personal appearance facet.
Other examples of compounds with problematic components are listed below:
Only four compounds had spurious substrings tagged. An example is r  X  ontgen+apparat  X  X -ray de-vice X , tagged as below, nappar meaning  X  X acifiers X : 5.1 A pre-decomposed run As mentioned above, the MeSH tagger tags only maximal length (sub)strings from each subdomain of MeSH. The tagger also does not tag short strings unless they are separate words. This entails that short components will not be tagged unless decom-position of the compound is done first.

In order to see how these features affect the out-come of the tagger, I ran the Medlex list through the tagger after decomposing the compounds.

This time, 1095 compounds had one or both com-ponents tagged. 819 of these were used in the med-ical sense. This is a number which should be com-pared with 233 in the previous run. 276 compounds had components that were tagged although not used in a medical sense. Only one com-pound had a spurious substring tagged. 5.2 Standard language versus medical One problem in decomposing compounds and using the medically tagged components to expand queries, is that many words that are medical in some meaning or facet are common in standard language. Even if we know that such a component is used in the med-ical sense in a query, expanding the query with that component would bring on irrelevant documents. Examples of words with such properties are hand  X  X and X  and hj  X  arta  X  X eart X . Even though these words are used in medical senses they are also common in standard language, for example in lexicalized com-pounds or in phrases.

In the tagger run with the decomposed list, most of the 276 words that were tagged as medical, though not used in the medical sense, had as a com-ponent one of only 16 basic words. Below are a few such compounds that have as a component a word from that list, hand : I have presented a strategy of how to use domain information to decide when parts of a compound should be used in query expansion. Unfortunately I have not been able to test the effectiveness of this strategy. To get a true evaluation of the strategy, a Swedish medical test collection is needed. At present there is no such collection. However, my research at the moment is concentrated on creating a Swedish medical test collection, by the name of MedEval.
 The first step in my research is thus to create a Swedish medical test collection, the second to test query expansion strategies based on domain infor-mation, such as the one described here. The strat-egy described could be carried through not only in queries, but also in indexes. That is, if a document from the medical domain contains a medical com-pound, the index could contain not only the com-pound, but also its medical components. Still, a big challenge will be to work out how to deal with poly-semic and homonymic words and words with medi-cal and non-medical facets.
