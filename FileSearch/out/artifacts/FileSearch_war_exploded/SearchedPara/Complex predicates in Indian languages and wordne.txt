 Pushpak Bhattacharyya  X  Debasri Chakrabarti  X  Vaijayanthi M. Sarma Abstract Wordnets, which are repositories of lexical semantic knowledge con-taining semantically linked synsets and lexically linked words, are indispensable for work on computational linguistics and natural language processing. While building wordnets for Hindi and Marathi, two major Indo-European languages, we observed constructing a verb knowledge base for Hindi, which arranges the Hindi verbs in a language phenomena that bear upon the lexicalization vs. syntactically derived choice. One such example is the occurrence of conjunct and compound verbs (called Complex Predicates ) which are found in all Indian languages. This paper presents our experience in the construction of lexical knowledge bases for Indian languages predicates has been dealt with linguistically and computationally. We have con-which is a verb, is a complex predicate or not. Such tests provide a principled way of deciding the status of complex predicates in Indian language wordnets. Keywords Complex predicates Wordnet Ontology Noun incorporation Compound verbs Verb hierarchy 1 Introduction Complex predicates (CPs) (also known as complex verbs ) abound in South Asian languages (Hook 1974 ; Mohanan 1995 ; Verma 1993 ; Alsina et al. 1995 ). They occur in the form of nominal  X  verb combinations (called conjunct verbs ) and verb  X  verb combinations (called compound verbs ). The key questions that we seek to resolve are:
A. Given a N(oun) + V(erb) combination, is the noun incorporated into the verb
B. Given a V(erb) + V(erb) combination, is the second verb an aspectual/modal
These linguistically important and interesting questions are also highly signif-icant for computational linguistics (CL) and natural language processing (NLP). resources such as wordnets (Fellbaum 1998 ) and ontologies (Guarino 1995 ) and raises the following questions:
C. Given a corpus, how are complex predicates to be detected, thus paving the
D. How exactly should complex predicates be stored, keeping in mind access and construction of lexical knowledge bases for Indian languages with special attention to Hindi. The question of storing or deriving complex predicates has been dealt with linguistically and computationally. We have constructed empirical tests to decide if a combination of two words, the second of which is a verb, is a complex predicate or predicates in Indian language wordnets. An additional application of this work is the current research interest. 1.1 Hindi verbs calnaa ( walk ), caRhnaa 1 ( climb ) etc ., are examples of simple verbs in Hindi, and aarambh karnaa ( start ), likh Daalnaa ( write up ) etc . are examples of complex verbs. Complex verbs themselves are of two kinds: conjunct verbs (see 1 and 2 below) and compound verbs (see 3 and 4 below).
Example 1 contains a noun + verb sequence, while 2 contains an adjec-tive + verb sequence. In examples 3 and 4, the first component of the verb complex is the main verb which occurs in its stem or other nonfinite form, while the second component is the  X  X elping X  verb that carries the verbal inflections. Figure 1 shows the taxonomy of Hindi verbs (Bahari 1997 ).

In Sects. 1.2 and 1.3 , we describe conjunct and compound verbs briefly. In Sect. 2 , we describe work related to this paper. Section 3 presents the background work on Hindi and Marathi Wordnets (HWN and MWN) and the Hindi verb knowledge base (HVKB), which gave rise to the computational questions (C) and (D) above. Section 4 discusses complex predicates and the empirical tests designed to identify them. Section 5 concludes the paper. 1.2 N + V Consider the word help in English, which appears in two different constructions:
The equivalent in Hindi for give help is madad (help) karnaa (to do) . In Hindi, structures such as the one in 6 are possible while the one in 5 is not (i.e., direct noun to verb derivation). The question, therefore, is which word(s) is (are) to be stored in a lexical knowledge base (such as the Hindi Wordnet), madad or madad karnaa or both? There are two possible solutions:
The first approach is the simplest. Syntactically there is no problem in terms of the argument structure of the associated verb and its subject X  X erb agreement tional. Consider, for example, chalaang maarnaa  X  X ive X  . maarnaa may mean either  X  X o beat X  or  X  X o kill X  . But neither meaning of the verb surfaces in chalaang maarnaa .

The obvious problem with the second solution is one of proliferating lexical items, redundantly; we cannot store every single N + V combination in the lexicon. Generally, the noun is a true object and there is no need to store it as a lexical unit along with a co-occurring verb. Thus, it is necessary to separate true conjunct verbs from other similar looking N + V sequences. Consider the two combinations caae whereas in the latter, jamhaaii ( yawn ) is not. 1.3 V + V V + V constructions are also difficult to deal with and describe, since there are many serial verb sequences to be found in the language. Consider, rahaa in 7 marks the progressive aspect, whereas Daalii in 8 indicates the attitude whereas the one in 8 should probably be (for reasons that we discuss later). As in the case of conjunct verbs, it is necessary to separate true compound verbs from other V + V sequences. 2 Related work 2.1 Study of complex predicates Constructions variously described as complex predicates, compound verbs, composite predicates ,or serial verbs range across a number of expressions in function of the Hindi compound verb:  X  X ...(1) the compound verb expresses perfective aspect and is the marked member of a privative opposition perfective-imperfective (2) one of the functions of the compound verb is to express the completion of one action compound (4) if there is no possibility of an action or event X  X  being anticipated, it is expressed with a non-compound verb. X  X 
Hook ( 1981 ) places the second verb, i . e ., the light verb, in an aspectual complex on par with the other auxiliaries in the language.

Butt ( 1995 ) proposes some criteria to enable cross-linguistic identification of CPs: contribute to it). The grammatical function structure is that of a simple predicate (there is only a single subject and no embedding).

The CP sequence may be formed either morphologically (lexically) or syntactically. X  X 
Butt ( 1993 ) makes a distinction between permissive, instructive and aspectual complex predicates and takes the stand that complex predicate formation in Urdu takes place at argument structure .

Bashir ( 1993 ) identifies the compound verbs of Kalasha and gives a semantic analysis based on  X  X repared X  and  X  X nprepared mind X . She proposes that the function of a compound verb is to grammaticize categories which involve the knowledge and belief state of the speaker.
 Fedson ( 1993 ) analyzes the semantic structure of the complex predicates in Tamil and classifies them into groups such as stative, perfective, indication of status, aspectual, etc .

Kachru ( 1993 ) remarks that  X  X n most of the South Asian languages, certain serial verbs express speaker attitudes, intentions, judgements, beliefs, etc. X  According to her, some of the serial verbs have a regular monoclausal or biclausal derivation and need to distinguish serial verbs from other V+V sequences.

Pandharipande ( 1993 ) in her article on  X  X erial Verb Construction in Marathi X  points out that V 1 and V 2 are paired on the basis of their semantic compatibility and is subject to syntactic constraints. She uses tests to show the split properties of the serial verb construction in Marathi. According to her, some syntactic phenomena such as passivization, participialization and verb agreement refer to or operate on only V 2 , whereas others, such as causativization , operate on both.

Paul ( 2004 ) in her thesis gives an account of Bangla CVs within the framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar . She proposes that the selection of a V 2 by a V 1 is largely determined at the level of semantics because the two verbs will unify if and only if they are semantically compatible.

Mohanan ( 1995 ) was the first to explicitly claim that Hindi has incorporation. In doing so, she draws on morphosyntactic as well as semantic evidence. Dayal ( 2003 ) also notices this fact and concludes that incorporated nouns are syntactically visible and can function like regular arguments X  X t least for the purpose of agreement. predicates, if the nominal predicate is logically transitive, and its second participant is a logical object, this object is selected as the grammatical object of the complex predicate X  X . 2.2 Lexical databases Wordnets are now considered indispensable resources for CL and NLP. The first wordnet created was for English at Princeton (Miller et al. 1990 ). Eurowordnet, a linked multiwordnet, soon followed suit (Vossen 1998 ). In the creation of lexical networks and ontologies, verbs have not received as much attention as they deserve. Ancient Sanskrit treatises on ontology like the Amarkosha (Jha Vishwanath 1975 ) deal meticulously with nouns, but not with verbs. The present day ontologies and lexical knowledge bases such as CYC (Lenat and Guha 1990 ), IEEE SUMO ( http://www.ontology.teknowledge.com/ ), WordNet (Fellbaum 1998 , Miller et al. 1990 ), EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998 ), Hindi Wordnet (Chakrabarti et al. 2002 ), Framenet ( http://www.framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/ * framenet ), etc . build deep and elaborate hierarchies for nouns, but the verb hierarchies are either www.cis.upenn.edu/verbnet ) is concerned exclusively with verbs and builds a very useful structure, but does not concern itself with building a hierarchical structure .

Classifying verbs and placing them in a structure according to their selectional preferences and other semantic properties are essential tasks in most text information processing tasks ( http://www.cis.upenn.edu/verbnet/ ; Levin 1993 ) like machine translation, information extraction, etc . Additionally, property inheritance ( e.g., walk inherits the properties of move ) facilitates lexical knowledge building in, for example, a rule based natural language analysis system (Dave and Bhattacharyya 2001 ).

Automatic augmentation to wordnets and ontologies are research areas of great interest currently (Rion et al. 2005 ; Marius 2005 ). They, however, deal with named entities (proper nouns) and link them with the instance of relation. (Marius 2005 also addresses automatic meronymy linking.). To our knowledge no work addresses automatic augmentation of verbs, and certainly not that of complex verbs. 3 Background work: creation of lexical resources We have, for long, been engaged in building lexical resources for Indian languages with focus on Hindi and Marathi ( http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in ). The Hindi and Marathi wordnets (HWN and MWN) ( http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhw ) and the Hindi Verb Knowledge Base (HVKB) (Chakrabarti et al. 2004 ) have been given Princeton Wordnet for English while paying particular attention to language specific phenomena (such as complex predicates ) whenever they arise. 3.1 Hindi and Marathi wordnets (HWN and MWN) HWN and MWN have been created with the current statistics given in Table 1 and the status of the other Wordnets is given in Table 2 for comparison. We have incorporated a supporting ontology to whose nodes the synsets are linked and whose details are given in Table 3 ).

While the HWN has been created by manually looking up the various listed meanings of words in different dictionaries, the MWN has been created derivatively from HWN. That is, the synsets of HWN are adapted to MWN via addition or deletion of synonyms in the synset.

Figure 2 shows the creation of the synset for the word peR  X  X ree X  in MWN via addition and deletion of synonyms from HWN. The synset in HWN for this word is MWN deletes { peR, viTap, ruuksh, ruukh, adhrip } and adds { jhaaR } to it. Thus, the Hindi and Marathi being close members of the same language family, many Hindi words have the same meaning in Marathi. This is especially so for tatsam words, which are directly borrowed from Sanskrit. The semantic relations can be borrowed directly, thus saving time and effort. 3.1.1 Synsets The principles of minimality , coverage and replaceability govern the creation of the synsets: (i) Minimality : Only the minimal set that uniquely identifies the meaning is used to create the sysnet, e . g ., ghar , which is ambiguous, is not by itself sufficient to denote the concept of a room . The addition of kamaraa to the synset brings out this meaning uniquely. (ii) Coverage : The synset should contain all the words denoting a particular meaning. The words are listed in order of (decreasing) frequency of their occurrence in the corpus. (iii) Replaceability : The words forming the synset should be mutually replaceable in a specific context. Two synonyms may mutually replace each other in a context C, if sentence. Consider, f svadesh, ghar g X  motherland  X f apanaa desh g X  the country where one is born  X  amerikaa meN do saal bitaane ke baad shyaam svadesh/ghar lauTaa
America in two years stay after Shyam motherland returned  X  Shyam returned to his motherland after spending two years in America  X 
The replaceability criterion is observed with respect to synonymy (semantic zation) of a lexeme. For instance, the two verbs { aanaa, jaananaa }  X  X now  X  appear in the same synset for the word know . In Fig. 3 , the sentence frames show that while aanaa  X  X now X  assigns dative case to the subject NP , jaananaa  X  X now X  assigns nominative case. The two verbs { aanaa, jaananaa }  X  X now X  denote the same concept and each may replace the other in this particular semantic context.
 A synset in HWN (and in MWN) consists of the following elements.
 A. Synset: {vidyaalay, paaThshaalaa, skuul} ( school )
B. Gloss: This consists of two parts.
The data are stored in the Devanagari script in MYSQL database. The part of speech for each entry is listed in this database. Sample entries from both HWN and MWN are shown in Fig. 4 . 3.1.2 Lexical relations HWN incorporates several commonly used semantic and lexical relationships along with a few new ones. A brief description is given below: (a) Antonymy is a lexical relation indicating  X  X pposites X . For antonym of moTaa ( fat ) and vice versa. The HWN also indicates the criterion under Other criteria are given in Table 4 . between two antonyms. Figure 5 shows the gradation relation among time words. (c) Hypernymy and Hyponymy encode lexical relations between a more general term and specific instances of it.
 hypernym of belpatra and belpatra is a hyponym of pattaa . (d) Meronymy and Holonymy express the part-of relationship and its inverse. Here, jaR ( root ) is a part of peR ( tree ) and therefore, jaR is the meronym of peR and peR ( tree ) is the holonym of jaR ( root ). (e) Entailment is a semantic relationship between two verbs. Any verb A entails a verb B , if the meaning of B follows logically and is strictly included in the meaning sleeping does not entail snoring .  X  X anner X  elaboration of another. For instance, (g) The HWN also cross-links synsets across different parts of speech. These links have been introduced for the HWN and are not a part of either the Princeton WordNet or the EWN. Cross-links between  X  X ouns X  and  X  X erbs X  include the following: i. Ability link specifies the features inherited by a nominal. For example, example, iii. Function link specifies function(s) associated with a nominal. For example, Cross-links between  X  X ouns X  and  X  X djectives X  are used to indicate typical properties of a noun. For example, { sher } X  tiger  X  ? { maansaahaarii } X  carnivorous  X . Links between morphologically derived forms mark the root form from which a particular word is derived by affixation. For example, { bhaaratiiyataa } X  indianness  X  is derived from { bhaaratiiya } X  Indian  X  and is linked to it. Figures 6 and 7 below show the web interfaces for HWN and MWN.
 3.1.3 Towards a multilingual Indo-Wordnet While wordnets have been created for many different languages, they all ultimately do one thing: they represent meanings via synsets and link them through semantic culture-specific synsets. This fact suggests a way of automatically linking the synsets of a wordnet using another wordnet which is already complete in all respects X  X ynset repository, semantic relations and lexical relations.

The process of setting up lexico-semantic relations in one wordnet using the corresponding information from another wordnet is called Relation Borrowing . The outcomes when deriving the MWN from the HWN. (a) When the meaning is found in both Hindi and Marathi, the relations are established in MWN for that meaning When the meaning is found in Hindi but not in Marathi, relation borrowing is not possible. For instance, { daadaa, baabaa, aajaa, daddaa, pitaamaha, prapitaa } are words in Hindi for paternal grandfather . There are no equivalents for this meaning in Marathi. (c) When the meaning is not found in Hindi but is found in Marathi, the relations must be set up manually. For example, { guDhipaDvaa , varshpratipadaa } meaning  X  X ew year X  are words in Marathi which do not have any equivalents in Hindi.

HWN and MWN implementations contain the following data structures: (a) A table called tbl_all_words which stores for each word the part of speech and illustrate this for word kar  X  X o X -(b) A table called tbl_all_synsets (Tables 7 and 8 ) which stores the sysnet ids, the synsets and the glosses of the various meanings. example, tbl_noun_hypernymy is the table for the semantic relation of hypernymy. Continuing the example for kar , Table 9 shows its hypernyms.

Using the basic ideas outlined above, the synsets of MWN are completely linked with semantic and lexical relations. This saves a lot of manual labour. An interface has been designed to facilitate the simultaneous browsing of HWN and MWN. The results for both the languages are displayed simultaneously. 3.2 Verb knowledge base (VKB) As a part of our language processing resources, we are also building VKBs for both English and Hindi. The VKB contains a hierarchical arrangement of verbs. For the English VKB, we have extracted the verbs from the British National Corpus (BNC) (BNC Consortium: British National 2000 ) and for the Hindi VKB, we have Mysore ( http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/indiancorpora/web/hindi/index.htm ). The differ-ent meanings of a verb are listed after consulting WordNet 2.1 ( http://www.wordnet. princeton.edu ), Oxford Genie (Hornby 2000 ), Hindi dictionaries (Verma and Kapur 1998 ; Shree Naval Jee 2000 ; Mcgregor 1997 ; Gupta and Agarwal 2003 ) and the Networking Language (UNL) ( http://www.unl.ias.edu/unlsys/unl/UNL%205specifi cations.html ), an electronic language for computers to express and exchange information. The UNL system is composed of universal words (UWs) (explained below), relations, attributes and the UNL knowledge base (KB) . The UWs constitute the vocabulary of the UNL, the relations and the attributes constitute the syntax and the KB constitutes the semantics. The KB defines possible relationships between UWs. The UNL represents information for any sentence as a hypergraph with words UWs have different labels depending on the semantic roles of each UW. Each relation label is a string of three characters or less. Any node in this structure may itself be a graph, in which case the node is called a compound word (CW) . Figure 9 relation arcs are labeled agt (agent), obj (object) and ins (instrument).
In its current manifestation the UNL contains 41 relation labels. The nodes the UWs. These are language words with restrictions given in parentheses. icl stands for inclusion and iof stands for instance of . UWs can be annotated with attributes such as number , tense etc . which provide further information about how the word is being used in that specific sentence. Any of the three restriction labels X  icl, iof and equ  X  X an be attached to an UW to restrict its sense. After specifying the Figure 10 contains an example from the HVKB. We first list the verb, followed by the UNL relations that it enters into, an example sentence, gloss, the syntactic frame (VTRANS, VOA-ACT, etc.). Currently, there are approximately 2,000 nodes in the HVKB and about 7,000 nodes in the EVKB. 3.2.1 HVKB and HWN The HVKB is built separately and exclusively for verbs. These verbs are then to be incorporated into the HWN. The HWN will use the subcategorisation frames from the HVKB and a verb X  X  synsets will incorporate the elaborated grammatical and semantic information that is stored in the HVKB. Following the convention adopted in the EWN, we provide information about any alternative syntactic frames, should verbs {aanaa, jaananaa}  X  know  X  appear in the same synset for the word know but in show the link between them. 4 Complex predicates (CP) As discussed in Sect. 1 , there are large numbers of multi-word verb constructions in Hindi. It is necessary to study these constructions carefully in order to store them systematically. In this section we will deal with N + V and V + V constructions. 4.1 Noun incorporation in Hindi verbs Hindi has many conjunct verbs that need to be distinguished from regular object noun and verb sequences. In what follows we describe the empirical tests we use to distinguish between the two constructions.
 A. Addition of the accusative case marker to the noun
B. Constituency tests, including movement, conjunct question and coordination
C. Addition of modifiers to the noun phrase 4.1.1 Adding the accusative case marker The aim of this test is to see whether the sentence is acceptable to a native speaker of Hindi after overtly marking the object with the accusative case-marker. While a true object noun will allow accusative marking, an incorporated noun will not. Consider the following examples,
In 9, the direct object of the verb lenaa ( take )is caae ( tea ). In 9a, the noun occurs without a case marker and in 9b, it is overtly marked; both sentences are acceptable. unacceptable. These nouns must be incorporated and are not true syntactic objects. 4.1.2 Constituency tests Three tests, movement , conjunct response and coordination are used to analyze the internal structure of conjunct verbs. 4.1.2.1 Movement of the noun Object nouns in Hindi are usually free to occur in non-canonical positions. If the N+V combination resists such relocation then it must form a single constituent:
In all the b examples, the noun has been moved from its canonical position. In acceptable. 13a and 14a are deemed grammatical while their b counterparts are not. independent. ruup lenaa ( take shape ) and bhaag lenaa ( take part ) are therefore taken to be instances of conjunct verbs. 4.1.2.2 Constituent response test Consider the following N + V sequences jamhaaii lenaa (literally, yawn take meaning yawn ) and chalaang maarnaa ( jump beat meaning jump ).
Questions on the actions in 15 and 16 reveal another property of incorporated nouns.
 Compare these with 19 and 20:
Unlike the questions in 17 and 18, the questions based on the action in 19 may nouns in 17 and 18 have a different status from the one in 19. 4.1.2.3 Coordination test Coordination is possible only between identical syntactic constituents. This test shows that incorporated nouns resist coordination. In 21, namkiin (snack) can be conjoined with caae ( tea ). In 22 niind ( sleep ) cannot be conjoined with jamhaai ( yawn ) and in 23, kshamaa ( forgiveness ) cannot be conjoined with vidaa ( farewell ). However it is possible to conjoin the entire N+V combination as is seen in 23b. This test shows that the incorporated noun and the verb combination have the status of a single lexical or syntactic unit. 4.1.3 Adding modifiers to the NP True arguments may be modified by adjectives, determiners, numerals, sentences, etc . but incorporated nouns do not permit such modifiers.

In 24 the modifier bahut ( a lot ) modifies the noun tea and not the whole verbal group but in 25, the modifier jor se modifies dhakkaa maarnaa ( push-beat )asa whole. Similarly, in 26 bahut ( a lot ) modifies madad karnaa ( help-do ) and not just either madad (help) or karnaa ( do ). 4.2 Compound verbs complex predicates. 1. V 1 inf-e+ V 2 : Here V 1 is in the infinitival form. V 2 is always the verb lagnaa Scope of adverb Scope of negation 4. V 1 kar + V 2 : In this type of multi-verb construction the suffix  X  X ar is attached Scope of adverb Scope of negation 4.2.1 Compound verb (CV) sequence as a constituent compound verbs. The tests are similar to the ones we outlined for conjunct verbs in Sect. 4.1 . 1. Scope of adverbs 2. Scope of negation 3. Nominalization 4. Passivization 5. Causativization 6. Movement
We have applied these tests to various data and elicited native speakers X  These tests provide a reliable way in which to detect true CVs in the corpus and to differentiate them from other V + V combinations. 4.3 CPs, HVKB and HWN In the previous sections we have discussed different multiword verb constructions in syntactic and semantic tests, we isolate CPs from similar constructions. The semantic analysis of both conjunct and compound verbs show us that these sequences are the result of lexical derivational processes and, consequently, these items are to be directly stored in the lexical databases like HVKB and HWN. HVKB already stores these verb sequences and they will also be included in the HWN as the latter expands, provided these multiword verbs meet the criteria for CP-hood. Thus, in the HWN, we will store both nahaanaa  X  X ath X  and snaan karnaa  X  X o take a bath X  in the same synset for the word  X  X ath X  . 5 Conclusion obtaining a principled way of deciding when and whether or not to include them in lexical knowledge bases. We offer systematic tests to identify complex predicates. The central question of when an N + V sequence or a V + V sequence become direct candidates for storage in the lexical knowledge base may be resolved by the application of these tests. Computational implementation of these tests should enable automatic augmentation of wordnets, a very desirable outcome. Our future work concerns such implementation of these empirical tests and we aim to integrate it with corpora search.
