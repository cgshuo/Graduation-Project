 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Keywords: Expertise finding, social network analysis, recommendation, topic models The objective of our system, Colleague Search, is to help propagate expertise without overburdening expe rts with requests for help and information. It does this by recommending potential experts, allowing users to browse summari es of their expertise, and providing social context (e.g. job titles and organizational chart location). This demonstration focuses on highlighting how social context information is used within Colleague Search to assist in expertise propagation. We also show a novel set of complimentary mechanisms to help users define queries and how the system X  X  profile pages are customized to the viewing user. Colleague Search supports an ite rative query process (Figure 1). The system supports a number of que ry inputs that provide the user with multiple channels to pose and constrain a query:  X  Keyword(s) : provides a familiar query mechanism.  X  People with similar interest : provides a query by person capability. The user selects one or more people from a pre-populated list of people in the organization. The system includes those people X  X   X  X opical interests X  as part of the query. This allows the system to find people who are just as knowledgeable as those selected, but perhaps more available.  X  Document text/Documents you collected from : provides a convenient way for people to indicate the topic/domain in which they would like to find an expert by allowing users to select existing documents (from web or pe rsonal archives). This allows users to find experts related to large amounts of text, which might be easier than requiring users to invent a set of appropriate keywords. The method also allows the system to better take advantage of topic models (Mim no, D., Li, W. McCallum ICML, 2007) which are used by the system to represent expertise and to model the information in unseen text as topics. recommendation results (Fig1-2), which include two components for each expert:  X  Social context information : Consists of each person X  X  location in the organizational chart, job title, and social network. The system allows the user to categorize re sults by the first two and shows the social network path through the organizational chart between the user and each recommended person. measured by topical similarity, importance, as measured by 
PageRank in a co-author network, social distance, as measured by a shortest path within the organization, or any combination thereof.
 Finally, the user can continue to investigate beyond the initial results by drilling down into the profile page of any recommended person (Fig1-3). The page 1) summarizes the person X  X  expertise through views of their recent work and 2) is customized to the viewing user, which allows it to show connections such as  X  X ou both cited the same document. X  Th e page allows the user to:  X  Harvest information directly (Fig1-4a).  X  Learn how to contact the pers on (Fig1-4b). When this is necessary, viewing the person X  X  expertise makes communication directed and more efficient.  X  Decide that the person would not provide information and reconsider alternate candidate experts (Fig1-4c).  X  Refine the search (Fig 1-4d). Colleague Search has components wh ich are similar to several other expert finding systems. For example, MITRE X  X  XperNet also has profile pages, but the Colleague Search profile pages are tailored to the viewing user, allowing it to provide additional functionality. Another system is TACIT X  X  Illumi o. Like Colleague Search it does expertise propagation, but in a differe nt way. It matches questions to experts who could answer. In so doi ng, Illumio allows users to learn about other users X  expertise indirec tly. In contrast, Colleague Search tries to make such learning easier by allowing users to directly browse summaries of othe r people X  X  expertise.
