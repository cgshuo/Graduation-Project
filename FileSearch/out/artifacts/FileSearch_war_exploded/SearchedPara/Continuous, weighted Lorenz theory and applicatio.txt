Here, as in Section 2.3 (23) , we suppose that the function proved now. as independent variable and as dependent variable. Hence the function L ( h , v ) is continuous. We have by (30) and for the function y = u ( x )asin (29) . Hence using (29) . Hence, putting (32) in (31) we have, as a variable of x :
Since (33) is positive, L ( h , v ) increases and since a  X  h cavely increasing function of y (i.e. the same graph as in Fig. 3 ). h 2.5.

 What is the use of the impact Lorenz curve L ( c , p )? a = 0 and b =+ 1 and the notation x = t . We have, denoting that with using (29) and (30) . Using (33) gives as function of time t (relation (38) ).

So we have that (using that t  X  0 () y  X  0 and t  X  X 1() y  X  1) and that and (38)
So we have that, by (13) , and (ii) of impact factors discussed in Section 1.

Proposition 2.5.5 Proof. Let t 2 [0,+ 1 ]. Then with g the unique value determined by (37) :
Since obviously g 2 [0,1], we have proved that
For the other inclusion, let g 2 [0,1]. Since valid. Hence, by (37) and (43) we have that received 50% of its citations. In other words, they defined the non-normalized impact factor Lorenz curves.

Proposition 2.5.6. The following assertions are equivalent: (i) L 1 &lt; L 2 ( meaning L 1 6 L 2 and L 1 6  X  L 2 except in (0,0) and (1,1)). (ii) RIF 1 [ y ] &lt; RIF 2 [ y ], " y 2 ]0,1[. (iii) RIF 1 { g } &lt; RIF 2 { g }, " g 2 ]0,1[.
 The same is true when &lt; is replaced by = .

Proof. This is clear by graphical inspection of Fig. 7 a and b. h (for publications) that a in (34) must decrease we hence suppose that c &lt; p . 3.1. Impact Lorenz curves and properties
Based on formulae (35) X (38) , we obtain the following formulae Hence or, in a form that is easier to interpret:
This important formula shows that L ( c , p ) is only dependent on one parameter, namely ing this explicitely.

Theorem 3.1.1. For any two situations, where we have p 1 ,c aging parameters in the second case, we have (denoting by L situation 1 and 2). Proof. By (55) it is clear that only (i) needs to be proved. Now, by (55) since 1 y 2 ]0,1[. h
Corollary 3.1.2. Let us have two situations as above. (i) Suppose there exists an y 0 2 ]0,1[ such that RIF 1 [ y (ii) Suppose there exists an g 0 2 ]0,1[ such that RIF 1 { g

Proof. This follows immediately from the fact that L 1 &lt; L false for RIFs calculated with fixed times t instead of using fixed values of y or of g . such that and
For two such situations (with parameters p 1 , c 1 and p 2 is the key function for which we must find examples such that f ( t (61) ).
Note first that (use de l  X  Ho  X  spital  X  s rule) and that
L words, using Theorem 3.1.1 and Proposition 2.5.6 we have the following result.

 understood the case (i): f (0) = 0. Hence this means that, by (64) and that all RIF 1 [ y ] = RIF 2 [ y ] and that all RIF 1
Now equality (65) is valid if and only if there exists a k 6  X  0 such that
Then f in (63) has the form function
This function decreases in t as follows from the proof in Appendix A , noting that and that ln c ln p &gt; 0. An alternative proof is given by the fact that using (51) and (52) and by the fact that the function L ( c , p ) is concave (using that 0&lt; c &lt; p &lt; 1).

Hence, we can choose k 6  X  0 freely so that hence the case (65) ). Let us give two pertinent examples.

Examples 3.1.4.2 (i) c 1 = 0.5 &lt; p 1 = 0.7, k =2, e = 0.01. Then we have the values but we can have f ( t ) &gt; 0 but only for very small values of t ! pact factors RIF 1 ( t ) are larger than RIF 2 ( t ) (since f ( t ) = RIF
Let us give a last example where the order between RIF 1 (1), RIF (ii) c 1 = 0.5 &lt; p 1 = 0.7, k =2, e = 1. Now
We have and Hence and fractional relative impact factors in the second case! 3.2. Explicite formulae for RIF[y] and RIF{ g } for all y, g 2 ]0,1[ as will be seen now.

Hence
In practice (see the next subsection) it is best to calculate this for t c ( t ) (cf. Section 1); taking t 0 too large gives too few data for the part [ t
Of course, the same method gives for that required. 4.1.2. Second method
Using (51) and (52) we derive: for every t &gt;0.So we have practical data (hence for discrete t =1,2, ... ):
As said above, the disadvantage of the method is that we need to know C and (especially) P . 4.1.3. Quick and dirty method
By (49) and (50) we have a one year score c ( t ) and p ( t ). This yields values of ln c might result (for practical data) in heavily fluctuating results. 4.1.4. Method using IF(2), IF(4) and IF(8) given by

This gives the following equation of degree 4 (based on (99) ) which has the solution p = 0.781 (close to the theoretical 0.8). Then (98) yields close to the theoretical 0.6. We find close to the theoretical 2.289. 4.2.2. Practical example cation) of p .
