One compelling finding from this fieldwork was the recognition that humanitarian decision making about them in due time and accessible format. As Jesper Lund, Head of Office for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the severely affected town of Tacloban stated: vent acceleration of trends that can turn into a disaster.  X  
In this paper we will outline the challenges for humanitarian information manage-focusing on two questions: 1. How should an information system be designed for sensemaking and decision sup-port in sudden onset disasters? mation system can be achieved while respecting constraints in terms of time and resources available? In the response to Haiyan, the importance of information management has been wide-ly recognized. In most organizations, information management officers (IMOs) work or a map. These information products by their very nature mostly provide a snapshot different policy-and decision-makers to satisfy aid organizations, donors, govern-ments, the military, from international to local levels. The multitude of organizations and decisions, the divergence of needs, information sources, temporal and geographi-cal scales, bandwidth constraints and a virtually unlimited variety of information that were openly shared with the whole world, create a frantic pattern of constant requests, back. Marc McCarthy, a member of the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team and deployed in one of the worst hit areas within days after the Ty-phoon X  X  landfall expressed the resulting confusion and irritation among responders bluntly and succinctly: sponse, no model can be developed to timely explain and predict the behavior of the disrupted socio-economic system or the consequences of decisions on how and where to intervene (DiMario et al. 2009). Therefore, information management in sudden goals cannot be reached. 2.1 Decision Support in Humani tarian Disaster Response How humans approach a decision depends on the information and understanding of the systems that affect the results of decisions. Under stress and pressure, we mostly follow Disasters, however, pose complex problems that largely defy such simplifications. 
Complexity and uncertainty are certainly not new aspects of decision-making (Rit-tel &amp; Webber 1973). Yet as organizations and individuals increasingly rely on models for data processing and on Information Syst ems to share information, decision-makers operate in circumstances that are more difficult than ever before, while they struggle to maintain oversight and control. Turoff, Chumer, Van de Walle and Yao (2004) presented the Dynamic Emergency Response Management Information System (DERMIS) framework for information system design and development that addresses communication, information and decision-making needs of responders to emergen-cies. As Turoff et al. (2004) stated, the unpredictable nature of a crisis implies that the exact actions and responsibilities of possibly geographically dispersed individuals and teams cannot be pre-determined. Therefore, an information system should be able to verse flow of accountability and status information upward and sideways throughout any responding organization. 2.2 Wicked Problems In policy-making, the term  X  wicked problem  X  has been coined to refer to problems that are characterized by fundamental uncertainty about the nature, scope and behavior of onset disasters confront decision-makers wi th wicked problems that are further com-plicated as a disaster entails a catastrophic event generating dramatic impacts that can propagate rapidly through the system (Rasmussen 1997). 
The way to understand and analyze a wicked problem depends on the decision-standard solution nor algorithm (Coyne 2005). Some approaches aim at adapting knowledge-based models to consider uncertainty and complexity by decomposing the overall system into sub-systems that are modeled separately (Rasmussen 1997). By neglecting interdependencies, important asp ects associated to the emergence and in-flawed expectations regarding both the actual consequences and the manageability of the problem. 
Therefore, approaches need to be developed that embrace the lack of situational awareness, resources and time, particularly in the early phases of a disaster. We pro-consequences rather than relying on models. Such  X  X oft X  approaches are considered as model-based  X  analyze and respond  X  (Mingers &amp; Rosenhead 2004). 
In the response to sudden onset disasters, information management should be tar-geted at facilitating collaboration between the many organzations and actors involved. regional level. In the words of UN OCHA Head of Office Jesper Lund: 
The ultimate challenge in wicked problems is making good decisions on the basis problem and the understanding of it continously change. Re-planning  X  X n cours de route X  is often required (Benjaafar et al. 1995). Therefore, good probing should aim at the identification of drivers that considerably change the performance and ranking of alternatives. Information management should enable monitoring the situation, making sense of it and acting upon the (new) understanding (Pich et al. 2002). 2.3 Risk Accelerators as Basis for Information Management use (Frosdick 1997).

Following this ratio-nale, international engineering standards such as ISO 14971 define the risk associated to an event as the product of the event X  X  probability and harm (Rakitin 2006).

Ideal-ly, the set of scenarios should enable them to understand and monitor all risk drivers, but this is usually not feasible given restrictions in time and resources; and limitations in knowledge. To identify the most relevant risk drivers, we propose to identify fac-tors that are driving or triggering changes in the  X   X  X  performance and impact the eval-uation of the decision alternatives.

Our concept of risk recognizes that it is impossible to describe all possibly relevant mance. Ergo,  X  X isk X  is largely a relative concept depending on the current knowledge and organizational or societal preferences and goals. Taking a relevance-instead of likelihood driven perspective , we advocate to systematically uncover relevant scena-rios by using techniques from information management and decision support, such that systems can be designed that are less prone to substantial losses in any situation. 3.1 Exploration of Complexity through Scenarios Data interpreted in the context of a disaster will result in assumptions about its possi-mind sets supports probing by helping decision-makers to explore the consequences create common situation awareness among key stakeholders. By their very nature, scenarios represent diverging paths of the disaster X  X  possible evolution, and can hence they can be used as a tool to embrace different opinions rather than aggregating and averaging them, or choosing just one specific opinion. 
Scenarios should address the information needs of decision-makers. Especially at about what has happened is available.

Disaster responders operate under pressure and strain, including risks for personal networks, this leads to a plethora of redund ant pieces of information that is collected and processed individually, instead of being shared between different responding expressing tacit knowledge (Kim 1998). Not everyone has the same experience with respect to a crisis situation since such ev ents are relatively rare (King 2002), resulting in different reactions of professional responders and population affected. Tacit know-practice (Kim 1998). Again, in the words of Jesper Lund: 
Information is typically perceived as credible when it matches the expectations or source (reliability by expertise) or the process that was used to derive the information ble way, making potential cause-effect chains explicit (Comes et al., 2012). 3.2 Providing Information, not Data As Sebastian Rhodes-Stampa stated for the humanitarian response efforts he was coordinating in Tacloban, information needs could be very different depending who requested the information, and for what purpose. Along with the increasing availabili-situation reports in various levels of temporal and geographical detail. In his words: should be tailored for specific decisions and address decision-makers X  needs to avoid series of scenarios might for instance include the needs of the population as they are and explore the impact of disaster relief supplies as a basis for the planning of huma-nitarian logistics. On a more operational level, scenarios can support coordination by presenting information about the current projects and the future presence of aid organ-izations (building on the so-called Who-What-Where or 3W database), and comple-menting the efforts with numbers of population and potential migration patterns. 
To support sensemaking each scenario should present an understandable develop-ment of the situation; i.e., processed information including cause-effect chains rather than raw data.

Distributed techniques for scenario construction various agencies and authorities, bringing together local experts, professional res-Network, a global network of volunteers), and scientists with different backgrounds. 3.3 Addressing the Dynamics It takes time to collect and process data ; to share and communicate information; and actors and organizations. In the very initial phase of humanitarian response, informa-tion is typically far from complete, yet the urgency of the response necessitates action nevertheless. As Andr X  Pacquet from the International Committee of the Red Cross and responsible for operations in the heavily affected town of Guiuan put it: 
As time passes, the information about the problem and the perception thereof can change. Hence, continuous revisions and co rrections are necessary while considering the scarcity of resources available for sensemaking and to support the decision-makers. Therefore, scenario updates need to be conducted in an efficient and respon-sive manner (Comes, Wijngaards &amp; Schultmann, 2012). 
To this end, two aspects need to be resp ected: relevance and validity. In the context of updating, relevance is assessed in terms of the potential consequences of neglecting the new information. It is therefore necessa ry to assess if the new information is  X  rele-tional or structural: information updates may change the measured or forecasted value of a variable, or its likelihood. A structural update requires mechanisms that account tives. This is for instance the case, when ne w impact factors are identified as the un-derstanding about the problem grows, or as expert X  X  previously implicit assumptions become more explicit. Our approach to manage information and support decision-makers who are facing wicked problems in complex environments can be summarized by answering the two questions posed in the introduction. Ad 1: Information Systems Design. The behavior of complex systems cannot be the problem and neglect the lack of knowledge (Pathak et al. 2007). To support deci-sion-makers who face complexity, we propose the use of scenarios to systematically explore harmful future developments. This entails continuous sensemaking and seek-ing to identify risk drivers as they emerge, while evaluating and continuously adapt-that are commonly called  X  X ntuition X  or  X  X xperience X  need to be supported by appro-priate information systems. As Weick (1995) put it,  X  X e need to understand more about Sensemaking Support Systems as well as Decision Support Systems, which means we need to know more about what is being supported X . We have referred earli-er to the DERMIS design premises as introduced by Turoff et al. (2004) providing a framework for the design of Humanitarian Information Management Systems. Ad 2: Scenario Construction. Given limitations in time, effort, and resources, scena-that most significantly distinguish advantages and drawbacks of promising alterna-tives or the currently implemented strategies. To understand and detect potential flaws, we use scenarios for probing in a way that is targeted to identify the most criti-and credibility. To embrace the dynamics of a situation, and potentially swift system changes, information systems need to provid e updating procedures to efficiently inte-grate new information and support sensemaking and decision-making on the basis of the latest understanding of the situation. 
Inherent to the complexity of the situation, no method can guarantee to find all crit-ical and loss-prone risks or risk drivers, and to communicate them at the right time to the decision-makers. Yet, in contrast to most modeling and statistical techniques, our method aims at identifying these drivers by re ferring to professionals, local or remote sets for critical sensemaking and robust decisions. By referring to different experts per piece of information, we aim at avoiding groupthink and, to some extent, the confir-wrong. 
To choose and prioritize information products and scenarios, the following ques-tions need to be addressed:  X  Number of information products to be selected: how can the trade-off be made  X  Similarity: how can the similarity or difference of information products and  X  Reliability: how can the plausibility and reliability of scenarios, which com- X  Relevance and selection: how can the most relevant information products be designing information systems to answer these questions, it is vital that the decision-makers X  needs and the constraints of sudden onset disasters are respected.

It seemed like a good idea at the time. In 2009, Greece X  X  new government, instead of staffing the ministries X  Secretary General positions through the, commonly, opaque political appointments [18, p. 79][19, p. 157], it provided a form to submit online applications. As a professor of software engineering interested in public service, I decided to apply for the positio n of the Secretary General for Infor-mation Systems at the Ministry of Finance, a position that was in effect the Ministry X  X  cio post. I reasoned that by serving in this position I could apply in practice what I taught to my students; in this case how to provide high quality eGovernment services in an efficient ma nner. After a couple of interviews and a few weeks of waiting time I started serving, for what was to be a two year term, at the General Secretariat for Information Systems ( gsis ).
 Gsis develops, runs, and supports the information systems used at the Greek Ministry of Finance. The most important of these at the end of 2009 were taxis , the software used in all of 300 Greece X  X  tax offices, taxis net, a web application that taxpayers use for electronic filing, and, icis net, which supports the customs agencies. Another significant body of work at the time involved the keying-in of tax filing forms, the calculation of tax returns, and the printing of tax assessment forms and payment notices (about 15 million documents per year). In addition gsis supported diverse tax compliance actions, mainly by running electronic tax compliance checks. Finally, gsis , contributed input for fiscal policy making in the form of statistical data and ad-hoc calculations.

Gsis reported to the Minister of Finance and was supported by the admin-istrative services of the Ministry of Finance. This meant that staff dealing with gsis  X  X  personnel and procurement were not reporting to me, but to the Min-istry X  X  General S ecretary. Oddly, gsis consisted of a single General Directorate. This comprised of three directorates dea ling respectively with software, hard-ware, and data entry. Unlike many oth er Greek civil service departments, gsis was lucky to be housed in a modern secure building. In 2009 it employed about 1200 permanent and temporary staff, a number which declined to less than 950 during my tenure. Approximately 135 employees had a university degree, 120 had a technical education degree, while the remaining 620 had a secondary ed-ucation degree. External contractors h andled most of the work associated with the development and maintenance of gsis  X  X  information systems.

Soon I realized that gsis was in a crisis. The implementation of key it projects was years behind schedule, some servi ces provided to taxpayers were based on fickle outdated technologies, a large proportion of the staff were not sufficiently qualified or trained, the employees X  union demanded a say on the service X  X  op-erational matters, morale was low, and some managers were unable to deliver the required results. Even worse, I soon discovered that, I did not have at my disposal basic tools of management, namely the formal authority or practical means to hire and fire, promote and demote, reward and discipline, outsource and develop in-house, or reorganize hierarchies. In short, I was in a position of power without authority.

As if those problems were not enough, s oon Greece X  X  government debt crisis broke loose [11,17], bringing the Ministry in the eye of the storm. A few months later, it was obvious that gsis would have to deliver dramatically more and better results with fewer personnel, on lower salaries, with a reduced budget. As the Secretariat X  X  head I had to deliver those results while battling with entrenched bureaucratic inefficiency, inter-departme ntal intransigence, clientilism, political patronage, drawn-out procurement proce sses, and an ineffective legal system.
To overcome these problems I targeted the obvious: better utilization of the organization X  X  human capital, exploitation of information technology, manage-ment by objectives and results, and impr ovement of the organization X  X  processes. Unfortunately, the existing Napoleonic state institutional framework  X  the for-malistic, legalistic, and bureaucratic way in which the Greek public administra-tion works [19, pp. 153, 164]  X  did not provide me with the necessary tools to implement the necessary changes. Consequently, I had to resort to the uncon-ventional techniques detailed in this experience report. When I started serving at gsis an experienced colleague told me that 95% of my performance would depend on the people I would select to work with. As time went by I realized he was 100% right. Unfortunately, the Greek public administration lacks well established practices and procedures that guarantee meritocracy. Therefore, meritocracy a lways depends on the personal choices of all those who serve in management positions  X  from the Prime Minister to the directors to the section heads. 1.1 Office Staff Breaking a tradition wher e department heads would appoint as their advisors former colleagues, acquaintances, frie nds, or even nephews, I decided to staff the five advisor positions, which were available for my post, through the  X  X penGov X  web application process I had previously used to apply for my own post. There I published the criteria for the positions and a web form in which applicants had to complete extensive details regarding their knowledge and skills. With the luxury of being able to choose among 750 submitted resumes, I was able to form a team of very capable, hardworking professionals, with valuable work experience in key positions in Greece and abroad. Because applications were submitted electronically through a form with keyed fields, it was easy to evaluate the applications with a small Perl script I wrote for this purpose, and determine those we 1 could call for an interview.

I interviewed the first batch of the short-listed candidates on my own. Then, following an unconventional practice followed by some tech-startups, I had the new members of my team participating in the process by interviewing the fol-lowing candidates. After each interview round our budding team held a meeting to discuss its results and select the new members. These meetings helped gel our team together, and bring on board staff that was compatible with its tech-nocratic orientation. There were tim es when team members disagreed with my view. Through our discussions I witne ssed in practice how in some contexts a group X  X  performance can surpass that of each group X  X  member [12].

Thechoiceofoneofourteam X  X members was particularly interesting. The application came from an existing gsis employee. I looked for her, and found her sitting in front of an empty desk. I asked her why she applied to work in the department she was already placed, and what I learned was eye-opening. She had returned from secondment to another organization two weeks earlier, and no one had bothered to assign her some work to do. So she applied to join our team in a bid to become productive. She quickly joined us, and as a top graduate of the National School of Public Administration with plenty of experience in managing eu -funded projects, she proved to be a valuable team asset. She became the contact point of our office with the rest of the public administration, handling responsibly and professionally the tens of requests that arrived at my office each day. When I saw her diligently working at 10:00 p.m. on folders overflowing with arcane documents, I couldn X  X  help but wonder how less productive our team would be if we had not published that open call for its staffing.

A few volunteers who, having completed a successful career, were willing to work pro-bono to help get Greece out of the crisis, complemented our team. I was surprised to find out that it was not formally possible to have these persons join me as advisors without paying them a salary. In a country in a crisis and in a world where volunteer organizations, activists, and ngo s often address problems more effectively than governments, the Greek state was putting barriers in the path of volunteers who wanted to help their country. For reasons of form and substance I was unwilling to have people work in my office without corresponding institutional coverage. Eventually, we solved this issue, by creating an advisory working group which comprised permanent staff members, my advisors, which were hired under a fixed-term contract, and these volunteers. 1.2 Staffing through Open Calls Having created a cultur e of meritocracy in my office, we looked how we could extend it throughout the Department. Initially the picture looked bleak. The department X  X  management positions were staffed through a formalistic, bureau-cratic, inflexible, and ultimately ineffective system, which used as its main cri-terion seniority rather than job qualifications, evaluations, and experience [19, pp. 162 X 166]. To overcome t hese restrictions we utilized the concept of working groups. A working group and its chair could be setup in a day through a simple formal decision by the Department X  s General Secretary. Indeed, at gsis there was already an established tradition of such groups, who were often also receiv-ing extra pay for their services. Sadly, t hey were often staffed through opaque procedures, sometimes taking into account political party alliances.

Based on the institutional framework of working groups we issued a number of open calls to staff the ones required to c omplete specific tasks. To stress that the selection was based on merit, we ensured that each call, the skills required for participating in the group, and the decision for the group X  X  composition, were published on the Department X  X  intranet. In the beginning we faced pervasive distrust; some advocated in water-cooler discussions that this process was merely a smokescreen to continue the party games of the past. However, the cynicism subsided, when people saw that some of the appointed working group chairs, could not have been selected based on their party alliance, and that therefore the appointment process was truly meritocratic. (Sadly this started a reverse grumble from people who believed that some positions should be preferentially staffed by people with strong political party credentials.) In total within two years we published and completed 38 open calls for working groups and their chairs.

The meritocratic staffing process I desc ribed kick-started a virtuous cycle involving the substantial increase in the engagement of young, highly qualified executives in the working groups, especially in the demanding positions of project coordinators. What drove this cycle? I r ealized that in the past professional, worthy staff members would avoid their involvement in committees and working groups, because they did not want to be associated with whichever political party was in power at the time. When those peo ple realized that staffing was decided on merit, not only did they participat e, but they also urged other colleagues to come forward, declare their interest, and work.
The pride of people who were selected on merit to chair working groups or, later, when it became possible, to be appointed in formal management positions, was revealing. A year after I took office, it was a joy to walk around the building late in the evening and find section heads, team coordinators, and managers working hard to meet a deadline or finish without interruptions work they had not found time to complete during the normal working hours. However, I also felt guilty because I lacked the means to financially reward these people who were working overtime to move the Department forward. Wages were set centrally across the board based simply on seniority. The few funds that were available for overtime pay (each year arriving months late) were a drop in the ocean compared to the actual time these people worked. So, again, I resorted to unconventional means: public recognition of those who put the extra effort, invitations of key people to meetings that I set outside the organization X  X  formal structure, walks by the office of people who worked late for an informal chat, and even the allocation of parking places. As for the overtime payments, we stopped dividing them equally across all the Department X  X  employees, which was until then the custom, and insisted on having these nominal amounts payed to those who actually worked a lot harder than others. 1.3 Staff Evaluation Another unconventional initiative we undertook in the field of human resource management, involved the genuine assessment of staff. Sadly, this did not fare as well as the other initiatives. The existing way in which civil servants were evaluated was hopelessly inadequate. (S ee [18, p. 78].) All employees received top marks in their mandatory periodic evaluations. This practice demoralized the best employees, and also provided fertile ground for cronyism to flourish. With the help of an external volunteer ad visor, who had extensive experience in managing large organizations, we designed and implemented a 360-degree ap-praisal [2] for staff working in my office. Under this appraisal scheme employees are evaluated by their superiors, their subordinates (if any), as well as their colleagues working at the same level of the administrative hierarchy. The assess-ment forms we prepared for the evaluators had fields where one had to describe the work and additional responsibilities of the evaluated staff member, comment on his or her work performance, and identify areas where there was room for improvement.

For the supervisors we designed a more detailed form where they could sum-marize the information from all evaluators, and rate the staff member X  X  work performance factors (administrative skills, written communication, verbal com-munication, problem analysis, decision making, delegation of work, work quan-tity, work quality, staff development, compliance with policies and procedures, and technical ability), as well as personal performance factors (initiative, per-severance, ability to work with others, adaptability, persuasiveness, confidence, judgment, leadership, creativity, and reliability). According to our plan, super-visors would then discuss with each ev aluated staff member his or her overall performance, areas for improvement, and his or her career plans. Finally, after this debriefing, the two parties would add to their form any additional comments they might have and sign it.

We started the evaluation process for staff working in my office, hoping that some of the high-level managers who wou ld receive the apprai sal forms (as as-sociates of my advisors or as my subordinates) would be take the initiative to adopt this procedure in their directorate or section. Sadly, this did not happen. I did not press the issue further, for I believe that strict instructions and pro-cedures are effective only for performing simple standardized tasks, while more ambitious results (such as the adoption of a work culture based on appraisals) can achieved only through education, leadership, and appropriate incentives. Moreover, two years after this initiative an academic colleague who specializes in human resource management explained to me that 360-degree appraisals are only meaningful in exceptionally mature and well managed organizations, so in this case we were probably over-ambitious.

Interestingly, I never got back my own evaluation forms which I gave to my fellow general secretaries and my supe riors. This made me reflect on the up-ward struggle a widespread introduction of performance appraisals would face. My pessimistic view was further strengthened when legislation passed in 2011 2 introducing performance-based pay for civil servants was put on hold until De-cember 31st 2016 with new legislation 3 passed just a year later. The performance of gsis in its it -related tasks was disappointing for an organi-zation that considered itself the cro wn jewel in Greek public administration it service provision. Procurement of hardware and software systems typically took years. For example, a new data center project had commenced in 2002 and was still ongoing in 2010. As a result, there was at the time no disaster recover site. If the existing data center got destroyed by a fire or an earthquake, many crit-ical government revenue management functions would be completely disrupted. Furthermore, gsis lacked a management information system, a human resource management system, as well as systems to perform tax compliance checks and organize tax audits.

These shortcomings were mainly caused by the sluggish bureaucratic proce-dures that were in place for public procurement and eu -funded projects. To reach a point where a project X  X  procurement con tract could be signed, the project had to jump through dozens of hoops and obtain as many signatures  X  in a theo-retically simple case we counted 28 steps. In addition, during the tender process rival contractors typically appealed agai nst any decision made by the public ad-ministration through the judicial system, where cases lingered for months. Con-sequently, vital projects for our work w ere years away from completion. Soon I concluded that from the time the public administration established the need for an information system it would take at least five years to put it into operation.
As if those problems were not enough, the projects X  eu funding often resulted in unworkable specifications. Agencies tended to inflate and gold-plate the spec-ifications, because, first, the agency pro curing the project had no motive to keep its budget under control, and, second, it did not know and when, if ever, it would obtain again funds for the project X  X  enhancement. These inflated and, due to de-lays, outdated specifications resulted in overly complex proj ects that were a pain to implement, difficult to sign-off, and a challenge to use productively. Adding insult to injury, in some extreme cases, an agency would find itself obliged to deploy the useless system it had ordered in order to avoid having to hand back the funding it had obtained for its implementation. The agency would thus find itself worse off compared to the state it was before it had ordered the system.
The unconventional, guerrilla, methods we employed to solve these problems involved adopting open source software , utilizing agile development methods to develop software in-house, and empowering the it market to develop solutions through the specification of open standards. 2.1 Open Source Software Open source software [1] can be freely dow nloaded, adapted, redistributed, and used. Although a large percentage of this software is developed by volunteers and academics, its quality is often comparable to that of proprietary offerings developed by large companies. Some well-known open source software systems, like the Linux kernel, the Python and php programming languages, and the the Postgre sql and the My sql relational databases are powering critical functions of organizations like Google, Wikipedia, and Facebook. In addition, millions of people around the world are using open source products, such as the Android platform for mobile phones, the Firefox web browser, and the Libre Office suite.
For us at gsis , the main advantage of open source software was not the abil-ity to read and modify the software X  X  source code, but the fact that we could download and install it for free with a click of the mouse [21], without getting en-tangled into nightmarish public procurement procedures. Another critical factor concerning the adoption of open source software is the availability of the required technology skills and services [7]. Thankfully, gsis ,asan it organization, had theseavailableinhouse.
 One of the first systems we installed was MediaWiki; the software driving Wikipedia [4]. This implements a wiki [13], a system that allows anyone to create linkable web pages (articles in the case of Wikipedia), and all others to read and change them. At gsis we configured the wiki to run on the organization X  X  intranet, so that it could be accessed only by staff members. By developing a few templates we implemented, in less than a month, a bare-bones human resource management system and a repository for organizational knowledge.

Specifically, we asked all employees to cr eate their own wiki page which should contain basic data about themselves: th eir name, office, department, telephone, responsibilities, specialization, and skills. For some of these elements we spec-ified how they should be coded through MediaWiki templates and predefined  X  X ategories X . For instance, an employee could specify fluent knowledge of En-glish or experience with sql . Categories grouped pages together according to their attributes in multiple dimensions. This allowed us to to query the wiki for things such as the employees working in a department or directorate, those who could program in a specific computer la nguage, or those who were experienced tax auditors.

At the beginning of my tenure at gsis I realized that meeting minutes were only kept for committees that were formally set up, and those minutes were only kept to satisfy the letter of the committee X  X  mandate. In almost all informal meetings, the keeping of minutes was considered an inconvenient luxury. To change this situation, we decided to document the agenda and the minutes of all informal meetings on the wiki. In the first meetings I kept the minutes. This gave me the opportunity to design a template page containing the key elements that should be recorded for e ach meeting: the place and time it was scheduled, the participants (with links to their personal page on the wiki), the agenda, and the action items. Through the wiki X  X  affordances it was easy for the same page to serve both as the meeting X  X  agenda (participants could easily add items to it), and for the keeping the meeting X  X  minutes (we copied the agenda, changing specific elements into action items; again participants could review and correct the minutes with a click of t he mouse). Through the templates we adopted each meeting was automatically categorized (e.g.  X  X roduction Board X ,  X  X ecurity Team X ,  X  X G Office X ), and all staff members could read the minutes of all meetings. Open access to all minutes on the wiki (172 entries by the end of my tenure) promoted the administration X  X  transparency, reducing power games with the selective dissemination of information, and cutting down misinformation and false rumors concerning decisions that were taken in the past behind closed doors.

Initially, the introduction of the wiki was met with skepticism. Some claimed that the ability to change any of its contents would lead to misrepresentations and vandalism. Soon, however, it became ob vious that employees were consider-ably more mature than what the naysayers thought, for no such cases occurred. If there was a problem, this was that st aff members were reluctant to correct each other X  X  pages, rather than that too many inconsiderate changes were made. Certainly, the wiki X  X  technology helped us in this regard, because MediaWiki keeps a full record of each page X  X  change s and the users associated with them.
It was harder to establish incentives for participating in the wiki. I felt that the administrative enforcement of its use would be counterproductive, for it would lead to formal compliance, rather than embracing the spirit of open cooperation I wanted to promote through its adoption. The wiki X  X  technology gave us a simple incentive mechanism. Links to pages that do not exist on the wiki (e.g. the personal pages of a meeting X  X  participants) are shown in red instead of blue, indicating to all that specific staff members had not yet created their wiki page. Next we established as a rule that those wishing to participate in an open staffing call should have a personal wiki page. This requirement was in full harmony with the spirit of transparency: those wishing to enjoy its advantages should abide by its rules. Finally, to help employees who had difficulty in using the wiki technology, we established a group of  X  X iki Samaritans X : eager and cheerful executives who undertook to assist those who had trouble using it. Through these means within two years of my term the wiki grew to cover over 2,500 pages of information.

Another open source software we installed and used was Redmine ,adis-tributed project management tool. Redmine allows the specification of a project X  X  tasks and the relevant deadlines. Based on the data entered, it will show schemat-ically each project X  X  progr ess, either as a percentage or through Gantt charts. Thereby, everyone involved in a project X  X  implementation or depending on it could see its progress. The deciding fact or for progressing in our many projects was the hard and methodical work of their coordinators. On top of that Red-mine brought transparency, accountability, and discipline in project manage-ment, highlighting the progress made by good coordinators as well as action items that needed our attention.

The fact that we could download Redmine at no cost, without going through a public procurement process, allowed us to deploy it across all gsis within a few days. As a counterexample, another government body decided, after a thorough study, to obtain a (much more sophisticated) commercial project management system. In order to sidestep the procure ment delays it utilized a (supposedly) flexible way to fund project preparatory work through so-called  X  X echnical assis-tance X  eu funding. These efforts began in J une 2011 with support from govern-ment officials at the highest level. My understanding is that five months later the procurement process was still underway. 2.2 Agile Software Development It is unrealistic to expect that all the software requirements of a large organi-zation can be met through open source software. Bespoke software development is often needed to satisfy specialized requirements. In the case of gsis avital system for combating tax evasion and improving compliance and revenue collec-tion was an audit targeting, assignment, monitoring, and optimization system called  X  elenxis  X . The project was in the works since 2005. By the time I started my term, the system had begun, after many delays, a painful period of limited pilot operation. Another system, crucial for designing tax policy and improv-ing the functioning of the tax administration, was a management information system ( mis ). Its development with eu funding was approv ed in 2007, but the corresponding request for proposals had not been published until 2009.
To solve these problems we turned to agile software development [6,15]. Our aim was to bypass the prevalent heavy, bureaucratic, and formalistic procure-ment procedures, and see how we could quickly deliver software that would meet the needs of the citizens and the Ministry X  X  staff.

Unfortunately, the principles of agile software development are at odds with the way government it projects are traditiona lly implemented in Greece. I presented the case for agility to the board of the Federation of Hellenic ict Enterprises, but got a hostile reaction. We were thus saddled with inflexible practices and contracts for large it systems like taxis , elenxis ,andthe mis . For instance, for a (theoretically) simple change of the vat rate a contractor asked to be paid for three effort months. We therefore tried to see how we could specify the use of agile development practices in new funded projects, and also how we could develop software with agile methods in-house by utilizing gsis staff.

We upgraded a small group of gsis developers, which was developing for years quietly useful and functional software into an  X  X gile development team X . Our goal was for this group to implement simple but effective solutions following Pareto X  X  80-20 principle under which the 80% of a system X  X  functionality can be implemented with 20% of the required effort. We worked in the same way with staff from the Department X  X  Applications unit and also with advisors who were seconded to my office. Thus, until the 25 million euro elenxis project was fully functioning, we ran simple tax compliance queries on the existing databases of gsis . As an example, one such check would verify whether taxpayers had declared in their tax form the income that partnerships indicated they had paid to their partners. (In many cases we found that, a single digit tended to be dropped with surprising frequency: a 101,345.00 payment would be declared as 11,345.00 income.)
Then the agile development group built within a month a simple application that would assign the cases to the corresponding local tax office and track their progress. (More details on this in Section 3.1.) Furthermore, in place of the mis , which had not yet been ordered, we impl emented a simple system where anyone could enter the title, parameters, and sql statement corresponding to queries that the Ministry X  X  departments often asked us to run on our databases. A web-based front end would show the available queries, allow authorized users to run them, and offer the results as a downloadab le spreadsheet for further processing. This simple application reduced the workload associated with running many boilerplate queries, allowing the staff to concentrate on the increasingly more demanding requests we were receiving. 2.3 The Government as a Regulator Rather Than a Customer Other systems required bespoke development at a scale too large for them to be implemented in-house with gsis  X  X  limited resources. In such cases, to avoid the quagmire of public procurement, we looked for ways to utilize the local it market, bypassing the deadly embrace of the government with large eu -funded projects. The unconventional approach we developed and implemented involved limiting the government X  X  role to that of a regulator. Under this approach we would specify technology standards and rules on how specific processes were to run, allowing the market to come up with systems that satisfied these requirements.
We found that through this approach it companies would swiftly deliver cheaper and better solutions than what we could expect by formally procuring it systems from government contractors. T wo interesting examples involved the implementation of the Single Payment Authority and the use of the Ministry X  X  registry data.

The Single Payment Authority, part of an effort to modernize the public administration, aimed to consolidate f ragmented employment practices by dis-bursing centrally the salary payments of state employees [8, p. 48]. Up until 2010 these were paid by hundreds of bodies scattered throughout Greece [18]. These bodies ranged from universities and hospitals to municipalities and ministries. The wide dispersion of bodies that paid state employees made it difficult to cen-trally monitor these costs, which in 2010 amounted to 27.8bn euro (24% of the General Government X  X  expenditure) [10, p. 137]. In addition it was suspected that the laxity of controls regarding how small entities paid their salaries left space for mismanagement and graft.

The original plan regarding the Authority was to implement a single payroll system covering the entire government. This would involve collecting the paper files of half a million employees in a central location, entering their data into the new payroll system, and then calculating and paying the salaries through that system. A new general direct orate was setup with the necessary directorates and departments, and even offices were rented in a posh business district for housing this new body. Unfortunately, the requisite payroll system did not exist, and, by taking into account the procurement time that was typically required for such system, it would take at least five years to put it into place.

Instead of this grandiose plan we proceeded as follows. First we defined and published technical specifications on how each body X  X  paymaster (for instance the one responsible for the Ministry of Agriculture) would send to gsis each month a file with the payment details for all state employees that were working there. The details included the empl oyee X  X  name, payment amount, tax and social security identification numbers, withheld amounts, bank account number, and other similar fields. The file format was xml -based and the specification was defined through a corresponding schema file. This allowed the body X  X  technicians to easily verify whether the files they had created were formatted in the specified way. If, for example, a record lacked the b eneficiary X  X  social security number, the problem would manifest itself before the file was sent to gsis . This minimized the communication problems with the scheme X  X  stakeholders.

In addition, we developed in-house a s mall application t hat would receive files uploaded over the internet, verify their contents, and prepare payment in-structions. Finally, we collaborated with the company that runs the interbank payment system and the state X  X  General Accounting Office to arrange the flow for the beneficiaries X  payments. In this way in less than a year Central Payment Authority was managing payments for about 3700 bodies and paying 570,000 state employees.

The decentralised manner in which the s ystem was developed allowed those who were actually running things quickly find the best and cheapest way to comply. Each body formatted its data through whatever way it deemed expedi-ent. Some modified their payroll application in-house, others collaborated with the application X  X  vendor, while smaller ones adopted simple ad-hoc solutions, which involved converting existing reports into the required format. Through a web search we even found a small remote company offering an application that would adapt the payroll data into the Single Payment Authority X  X  format for just 120 euros.

This decentralized implementation di d not meet all the requirements of the original system regarding of audits that could be made. However, in practice it turned out that just five simple but effective controls that the new system could implement (payments from multiple bo dies, exceeding the statutory maximum salary, salary payments from the private sector, tax filing, and payment arrears to the state) exceeded the throughput capacity of the competent 4 audit service. This demonstrated the agile programming yagni (Your Aren X  X  Going to Need It) principle [5, p. 18].

The second example where the gsis collaborated with the local it market as a regulator concerns the distribution of the Tax Authority business register. The online availability of the registry could greatly simplify transactions, saving time and money. For example, when a busines s needs to issue an invoice, instead of typing in all the counterparty X  X  details (name, address, phone, occupation), it could simply fetch them from the registe r using the counterparty X  X  tax identifi-cation number as a key. The easy availability of this data could also reduce the plague of fake invoices, because anyone receiving an invoice could easily check the details written on it as well as whether the listed company was still in business.
To aid the registry X  X  distribution gsis could implement bespoke applications, and provide them to the taxpayers. This had been the case in the past for applications that filed various tax forms. Instead, we offered the registry X  X  data as a simple web service, which was implemented in a few days. At the same time we published the web service X  X  specifications and issued a call for volunteers to develop clients as open source software. Within a couple of weeks we had at hand clients for a diverse set of platforms an d operating systems, including apps for cell phones. Companies that d eveloped accounting and erp software were soon using this functionality, as were web pages that were setup for this purpose. Sadly, this service ceased being offered without a warning in mid-2013, proving the ambivalent relationship of the State X  X  bureaucracy with public data. With increased agility and effectiveness in the areas of people and it manage-ment, we tried leveraging our improved capacity to achieve higher level, fiscal, objectives. This was an audacious move, for we were venturing at the limits of our legally prescribed comp etences, into areas tainted by chronic ineffectiveness and, possibly, graft. As we shall see in the examples outlined in the following sections, not all ventures had a happy ending. 3.1 Handling Tax Compliance Checks by Regional Tax Offices In Greece widespread tax evasion [3] a nd a large shadow economy harm the state X  X  fiscal management, horizontal and vertical equity, and economic effi-ciency [16]. Although the competent bodies for tax compliance at the Ministry of Finance were the General Secretariat for Tax and Customs Affairs and the Eco-nomic Crime Unit, from the beginning of my tenure I felt that gsis could help significantly in this area through the use of it . Perhaps naively, I believed that re-ducing tax evasion would be relatively straightforward, because we could swiftly locate thousands of suspect cases through electronic tax compliance checks, and send them off to the regional tax offices fo r further processing We therefore ac-tivated a previously legislated 5 high-level committee to plan electronic tax com-pliance checks, and started executing them. We regularly met as a committee to discuss and plan ideas for tax compliance checks. However after a few meetings I began to worry. What had happened with the cases we sent for processing? I was asking the departments who should be overseeing this processing, but I was not getting any concrete answers. I was t old that the processing was proceeding  X  X ithout problems X , and bringing in the  X  X xpected revenue X . However, nobody could tell me the number of cases that had been processed and the amount that was collected.

To obtain a more accurate picture of this process our agile development team developed a small web-based application that would assign the thousands of suspect cases to specific regional tax offices and ask them to process them. For every case that was closed (e.g. by calling in the taxpayer to file an amended declaration and pay a fine), the tax officers had to fill into a form the additional revenue received from taxes and fines. Th rough this application we could cen-trally monitor with objective measure s the progress on the case workload and also the efficiency of each compliance check. We could also verify that the cases were being processed at a rate that would not result in a backlog buildup. The data we obtained from the application was eye-opening: apparently many re-gional tax offices were not processing any cases for long periods of time. After a few months the system was operating t he (theoretical) workload processing period had climbed to 175 working days against a mutually agreed target of 60 days.

With concrete figures at hand I was able to do three things. First I could present the situation to the Minister of Finance, so that he could mobilize the respective tax office. However, I quickly realized that he was facing at the level of the Ministry the same problems I was facing at gsis :hedidnothaveathis disposal the necessary management tools, must crucially control of the heads of the regional tax offices. Therefore, the second step involved using publicity to pressure the tax office heads to handle the cases they were assigned. We created a process that would automatically publish on the web each tax office X  X  progress in the handling of the cases. Thus citizen s could see how many cases were assigned to their local tax office, (e.g. 1457 cases to an office in a leafy Athens suburb), how many the office had closed in the previous day (zero for this tax office on 2001-04-05), and how much revenue it had collected (for instance, 24,808 euros for a sea-side suburb tax office on the same day). Similar figures showed the cumulative results during the period the system was operating. 6 Finally, as the third step I wrote a small script, which at the end of each business day sent a personal email on behalf of the Secretary General for Tax and Customs Affairs to each tax office head with deta ils of the office X  X  progress on that day. The email was copied to the Minister, the competent Deputy Minister, and the corresponding General Directors. This pr essure seems to have paid off, because, according to the data we collected through this system, during 18 months of its operation 690 million euros were collected by closing 260 thousand cases. 3.2 Performance of Regional Tax Offices With the audacity that arises from na  X   X vit  X  e, I thought that management by ob-jectives, which could be cen trally monitored from the gsis databases, could be used for improving the overall performance of the tax administration. For this purpose we studied the effectiveness of t he regional tax offices based on a small set of metrics. We found what many susp ected: things were not working as they should be. According to the study only 1% of the fines imposed by the Financial Crime Unit were eventually collected by the tax authority, 30% of government pensioners did not declare their entire pension in their tax returns, while no one was monitoring the effectiveness of tax compliance checks. The study also found that just 24 out of a total of 300 local tax offices were responsible for collect-ing 71% of revenue (another manifestation of the 80-20 rule). Furthermore, the study recommended to measure and monit or a few key performance indicators for each major regional tax office:  X  the revenue collection cost,  X  the efficiency in closing suspect cases regarding tax compliance,  X  the revenue collected from closed cases,  X  the gap between collected revenue and the corresponding target,  X  the number of temporary audits performed per employee,  X  the progress of temporary audits,  X  the percentage of the fined amoun t that was actually collected,  X  the ratio of foreclosures to taxpayers in arrears, and  X  the level of tax compliance evidenced through the number of suspect cases. Interestingly, regional tax offices were traditionally monitored only based on the revenue they collected, as if t hey were a small corner-shop.

Using the infrastructure of the taxis information system, which supported most functions of the regional tax offices [22], we implemented a process to derive each month the necessary data, and compute the key performance indi-cators. Because tax administration was not keen on adopting such sophisticated indicators, preferring to keep on monitoring performance based solely on col-lected revenue, we adopted again the approach of publishing the figures on the web, hoping to pressure under-performing tax office heads to improve their op-erations. 7 The reaction was immediate: tax officers, union leaders, and tabloid press blasted that the information was incorrect, fragmentary, and did not reflect reality. A key argument was that it was unfair to point out that major offices had not conducted any audits within a month, because there were no auditors in their staff. Those shooting the messenger failed to grasp that the kpi swere useful exactly for highlighting and resolving such problems.

The moral of this exercise was that, wh ile there is a lot that can be achieved by publishing metrics as open data and by targeting concrete objectives, not all problems can be addressed through unconventional means. A couple of years later, partly in response to the outlined problems and a corresponding pro-posal [20], an independent but accountable tax administration body was set up [9, p. 100]. The aims of the new structure were to consolidate tax administration by closing 200 underutilized tax offices and setting operational targets for the remaining ones, assessing managers based on their performance, and obtaining legal powers to direct how local tax office resources should be used. The new structure was to be headed by a non-political appointee with control over core business activities and human resource management. 3.3 Grassroots Pressure A case where the availability of open data helped an action X  X  implementation con-cerned the deployment of the Single Payment Authority. During its deployment we tracked on a daily basis the number of government bodies and paymasters that were enrolled and certified. We had set specific goals for each ministry, with a plan of enrolling into the system 100% of employees through a succession of steps, which started with registrati on, and ended with successfully perform-ing an actual monthly payment. However, many ministries failed to respond to letters and circulars concerning the dep loyment deadlines. A colleague thought that, given the indifferent response our c irculars were receiving, we should try a different approach, namely applying grassroots pressure. Consequently, we de-veloped a website where employees could e nter their tax identification number, and see immediately whether their institution was integrated into the Single Payment Authority. Unsurprisingly, many employees, concerned about the fate of their payroll, began pressuring their superiors to join the Single Payment Au-thority. This increased significantly the rate at which various bodies joined the Authority.

We also saw that the administration failed to follow the project X  X  aggressive time plan. For example, circulars concerning integration into the Single Pay-ment Authority marked  X  X xtremely Urgent X  were flowing up and down the ad-ministrative hierarchy taking weeks aft er their dispatch to reach some schools. To avoid these delays, we used Google Groups to create a forum serving the gov-ernment X  X  paymasters. The forum was used extensively for asking questions and receiving informal help from other colle agues. A particular exchange was reveal-ing: the question was asked on 23:16 of a Sunday night, and a reply came just an hour later, at 00:35. The exchange exhibited conscientiousness, industriousness, and diligence that were at complete odds with the indifferent and slothful model of a civil servant portrayed by some popular media. During the two years I served at the Gr eek Ministry of Finance as Secretary General for Information Systems we restarted dormant projects, deployed many new electronic services, and supported the Ministry X  X  and the Government X  X  work in a number of crucial areas. I am often asked what was the decisive factor behind gsis  X  X  exceptional performance. I was certainly lucky to head a department that had actual implementation capabilities, a culture of project-based management, a technological nous, and many meritocratically selected, well-educated employees.

If I were to select one factor that mad e a difference, this was the constant struggle to balance short-term with long-term goals. Thus we devoted only half of our team X  X  efforts to the organization X  X  day-to-day running, which too often included fire-fighting (literally in one case). The other half of our efforts went into longer term improvements in the organization X  X  capacity: encouraging good people to head projects and teams, adopting best practices, training, adjusting management structures, leading by exam ple, i.e. demonstrati ng our expectations to the service X  X  permanent staff. Befor e we realized how time had passed, we were witnessing that the tiny seeds we had sown had grown to the point of bearing fruit. Thus, in less than a year, through the heroic efforts of its employees, gsis overcame the crisis it faced, transfo rming itself into a showcase of solid it service delivery.

A broader balancing challenge is between the actions required for managing a crisis and those needed to implement susta inable changes. Unconventional tech-niques, like those described in this experience report, appear to be necessary in times of crisis, in order to cut the Gordian knot of inefficiency and inertia. They can often deliver significant result s, and they can even be a potent source of organizational innovation. However, these unconventional techniques are also associated with considerable risks of negative externalities: lack of continuity, stakeholder alienation, and loss of direction. Sustainable changes can be imple-mented by institutionalizing successful unconventional measures or by adopting reforms in a top-down fashion [18]. The implementation task will require culti-vating the ground for change, communicating effectively with all stakeholders, forming alliances [14], as well as acquiring and spending political capital. This will be Greece X  X  challeng e in the coming years. Acknowledgements.
