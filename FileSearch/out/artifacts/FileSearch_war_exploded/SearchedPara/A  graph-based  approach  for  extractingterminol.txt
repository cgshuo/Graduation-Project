Nowadays, much of the stored electronic data, such as HTML, SGML and XML all data handled by DBMSs consists in having a well-defined structure. On the con-known structure and, even when this is known, it may change frequently over time (Abiteboul 1997; Abiteboul et al. 1997; Abiteboul and Vianu 1997; Buneman 1997; al. 1997; Papakonstantinou et al. 1995; Quass et al. 1995; Suciu 1998; Tresch 1995).
Structured information sources, such as dat abases, can be considered as a particular can be generalized to the larger context of semistructured data. Obviously, they can be exploited only as guidelines becau se the context is much more general. exploited above all for defining the semantics of involved schemes and, then, for in-tegrating heterogeneous information sources, for designing techniques for converting the context of semistructured data (Suciu 1998).

In order to of the semantic relationships holding between concepts belonging to an information source.
Our conceptual model is obtained by associating a network, Net Network (Semantic Distance-Relevance Net work), with each information source S .
Net ( S ) has a node for each concept in S .Arcsin Net arc from x to y , the label l xy consists of a pair semantic distance coefficient between x and y , whereas r relevance coefficient of y w.r.t. x . d xy indicates how much the concept expressed with x . r xy indicates the fraction of insta nces of the concept denoted by x for which by y (see, below, Sect. 2 for more details about these two coefficients).
The technique for extracting synonymies and homonymies takes a set of semi-structured information sources as input and returns a Synonymy Dictionary, SD ,and an Homonymy Dictionary, HD . Derived properties are fuzzy and are represented as triplets A , B , f ,where A and B are the involved concepts and f is a fuzzy

In this section, we present our SDR-Network conceptual model.

Definition 2.3. A D _ Pa th n is defined as a path P in Net ponding path semantic distance is greater than or equal to n and less than n
Definition 2.4. Define the CD_shortest_path (conditional D_shortest_path) N between two nodes N and N in Net ( IS ) and including an arc A as the path having the minimum path semantic distance among those connecting N and N and includ-ing A . If more than one of these paths exist, one of those having the maximum path semantic relevance is taken as N , N A .

Proof. Immediate from the Definitions 2.3 and 2.5 and by noting that the semantic distance coefficient associated with an arc is nonnegative .

Proof. Immediate from Proposition 2.1 and by noting that an arc belongs to nbh only if it does not belong to nbh ( x , j ) for all j An example will help in illustrating the presented concepts. Example 2.1. Consider the node Student of the SDR-Network reported in Fig. 1.
The neighbourhoods associated with this node are as follows:
For instance, the first arc belongs to nbh ( Student , 0 ) is a D _ Pa th 0 and Student = ID . The other arcs of nbh analogously.
For instance, the arc A = Course , Student _ Number nbh ( Student , 1 ) because Student , Student _ Number A is a D _ Pa th

Network can be inferred directly from the XML document with some additional computational costs.
Recall that the set NS ( D ) of nodes of the SDR-Network Net an information source D , is the union of two sets, NS NS C ( D ) denotes complex nodes, whereas NS A ( D ) indicates atomic nodes.
NS C ( D ) is obtained from a nonterminal eleme nt of the DTD. Vice versa, each node with the following exceptions: 1. IDREF and IDREFS attributes have no associat ed node because they denote links
Note that all nodes in NS ( D ) can be obtained by examining the DTD only.
In this section, we illustrate how the set of arcs AS tively, an attribute) of D and the corresponding node in Net
AS ( D ) is the union of the sets AS N ( D ) and AS R ( D called nesting arcs , are obtained from nesting relationships. An arc S and IDREFS . Therefore, AS N ( D ) can be obtained by examining the DTD only. Arcs belonging to AS R ( D ) , called reference arcs , are derived from IDREF and
IDREFS attributes. In particular, given an IDREF or an IDREFS attribute of an erence arc from the SDR-Network node S to the SDR-Network node T . Because IDREF and IDREFS attributes are untyped, only the source nodes of the arcs of AS ( D ) can be derived from the DTD; for determining the target nodes, we clearly need to analyse the data component, that is, the XML document. following, we use the term concept to indicate an element or an attribute defined in a DTD and we call objects the corresponding instances represented in the associated XML document.

Definition 3.1. Let D be an XML document. An object O is a component of an element E and E is a subelement of E or (ii) O is the instance of an element E and O is the instance of an attribute A of E .

The function comp ( O ) can be easily defined, that, given an object O , returns the set of its components.

Definition 3.2. Let D be an XML document and let Net
SDR-Network. Let N be a node of Net ( D ) .The XML-Assoc-ObjSet of N is the set of instances of the concept from which N has been derived
Consider now the following sets of nodes:  X 
NS S denoting the XML-Assoc-ObjSet of S ;  X 
NS T denoting the XML-Assoc-ObjSet of T ;  X  O  X  NS T , O  X  comp ( O i ) .

The semantic distance coefficient d ST for S and T is defined as: where a consequence, the semantic distance associated with it is 0. A terminal subelement directly defines the concept associated with it; vice versa a nonterminal subelement defines the concept associated with it by means of the set of its subelements. Thus, given an object O (belonging to RNS S , T ), a terminal subelement O (belonging to both NS T and comp ( O )) is semantically closer to O than a non terminal subelement
O (belonging to both NS T and comp ( O ) ). Moreover, if two or more terminal subele-ments with the same name are components of the same element O , we can conclude whereas they, as a whole, do specify this pr operty. In this case, the semantic distance defined for single-terminal elements and nonterminal ones. IDREF and IDREFS attributes generally represent relationships between elements; thus, the semantic dis-tance between an element O ,havingan IDREF or an IDREFS attribute, and the elements.

Property 3.1. The semantic relevance coefficient r ST is equal to 1 when either T is a REQUIRED attribute, or T is an attribute having a default value or T is a subele-ment that an operator + is associated with in the DTD.

It is now possible to determine the computational complexity relative to the con-struction of an SDR-Network from an XML document.
 Property 3.2. The worst-case time complexity for constructing an SDR-Network
Net ( D ) from an XML document D is quadratic in the number of instances of D . instances of D .

Note that, in order to construct an SDR-Network from an XML document, no based only on the structure of both the DTD and the corresponding XML document; therefore, they can be automa tically executed by a parser.
 This closes our discussion about the construction of an SDR-Network from an section is presented.

Recall that our approach consists of three phases, namely (i) basic similarity computation, (ii) refined similarity computation, (iii) synonymy and homonymy der-ivation. In the following theorems, we first give the computational complexity of the three phases and then summarize the overall complexity of the approach. Theorem 6.1.

LSPD errors. Recall that the plausib ility coefficients associated with LSPD entries are defined with the support of the human expe rt; as a consequence, some possible errors might occur therein. We have consid ered various error scenarios and, for each of them, we have measured some parameters, namely maximum increment , mean variation and maximum decrement in returned plausibility coefficients, changes of dynamically computed and that all coefficients belong to the real interval fraction of differences in the intersource property derivation caused by the presence of errors associated with the scenario in consideration.

The results of our experiments show that our approach presents good stability that, when some limited errors occur in the LSPD , the consequent differences in de-rived intersource properties are generally quite small. Clearly, when errors in defin-ing plausibility coefficients become more numerous and significant in magnitude, the implied differences in the intersource property extraction become unacceptable.
A second series of experiments has been carried out for verifying soundness and completeness of our approach. In particular , we have applied it on several information sources; in this case, no LSPD error has been considered. The corresponding results have been compared with those provided by human experts who manually examined occurs, results about both soundness and completeness are particularly satisfying. variations of soundness and completeness caused by the presence of errors in LSPD

After this, we compare our approach for deriving intersource properties with various related ones proposed in the past. handling information sources characterised by different data representation formats. Most of these models have been conceived mainly for supporting querying activity.
Only a small number of them have been proposed with the main purpose of support-belongs to this latter group.

An interesting conceptual model capable of handling various information source formats has been introduced in the context of the Lore project (Goldman et al. 1999). representation of instances included i n XML documents whereas the SDR-Network is an intensional model, i.e., it is mainly concerned with concepts represented within information sources and their relationships.
 In Lore, given an XML document, it is possible to obtain a summary called DataGuide (Goldman and Widom 1997). DataGui des have some analogies with SDR-
Networks in that they are intensional graph-based models; however, they do not versa, the SDR-Network uses both the semantic distance and the semantic relevance coefficients to summarize some information about instances.

This model represents data by using an edge-labeled graph, called graph database ; a scheme is represented by a graph where vides methods for verifying if either a gra ph database or one of its fragments conform to a graph schema as well as for obtaining subsumption and equivalence relationships on graph nodes. The conceptual model of Buneman et al. (1997) and Calvanese et given an information source S , the corresponding SDR-Network is unique and cap-graph schemas can be associated with it because each graph schema is meant to offer multiple hints to a query optimizer.

In Madhavan et al. (2001) Cupid, a system for deriving intersource properties among different information sources, is presented. The approach is mainly based on matchings. The approach underlying Cupid and our own share some characteristics. based techniques for representing source schemes, (iii) derive intersource properties, instances associat ed with each concept.

Haas et al. (1999) describes the system Clio , conceived for supporting the semi-scribing column-level value correspondences. The system then selects enough func-clauses to tie together sources that supply input to the functions. As for differences between Clio and our approach, we observe that the former works at the extensional user to supply initial correspondences, whe reas our approach requires the support of a standard thesaurus.

In Doan et al. (2001), an approach, called LSD (Learning Source Description), for carrying out scheme matching activities is proposed. LSD exploits machine learn-for other differences between LSD and our approach, we observe that  X 
LSD requires quite a heavy support of the user during the initial phase, for required. Vice versa, our approach requires a minor human intervention during the preprocessing phase but needs a further intervention at the end for validating obtained results.  X 
LSD operates on XML documents, whereas our approach is capable of repre-senting and handling several information source formats.

In Mitra et al. (1999), the system SKAT is presented. SKAT exploits first-order tionships and then validates generated matches. SKAT approach is similar to our own in that it is semiautomatic, exploits graphs to represent information sources, and looks define term-based matching rules. The ma in differences between the approach imple-
Web sources consists of one node per Web page, whereas we derive one graph rep-resentation for each Web document; in this way, we are able to obtain more refined representations of involved sources. SKAT exploits first-order logic rules to express derived matchings; this allows it to represent possibly complex relationships between concepts. However, in SKAT, a heavy intervention of human experts is necessary in only for validating automatically derived matchings.
 among XML documents. An XML document is translated into a set of elements, called x-classes ; this representation allows the derivation of synonymies, homonymies and type conflicts existing among concepts belonging to different sources. The know-ledge of these properties is then exploited for carrying out the integration task. Both the approach described in Castano et al. (2002) and our own are rule based and ob-tain accurate results by considering concep t semantics. However, the two approaches (2002) works only on XML documents, whereas SDR-Networks allow handling sev-Castano et al. (2002) is heavier than that needed in our case. scheme match operation appearing quite close to our intersource property extraction determining the semantic similarity of two concepts.
 formalism named HDG. Then, obtained HDG graphs are integrated; such a task belonging to different sources; in particular, Lim and Ng (2001) defines the relation-ship , indicating if a concept is a hypernym or an ancestor of another. The global intersource properties they handle, they shar e various similarities; indeed, (i) both of ceptual model; (iii) both of them exploit a lexical dictionary, in particular WordNet; (iv) both of them are almost automatic; (v) both of them handle various information source formats.
In this paper, we have proposed a semiautomatic technique for extracting synonymies and homonymies between concepts of inform ation sources characterised by different duced a new conceptual model and a related metrics for representing both concepts belonging to semistructured information sources and their semantic relationships.
We have also determined the computational complexity of our approach, we have performed some experiments for measuring its performances and, finally, we have compared it with the related methods pr eviously proposed in the literature.
