 Until recently, the lack of user activity on search results was perceived as a sign of user dissatisfaction from retrieval performance. However, recent studies have reported that some queries might not be followed by clicks to the content of the retrieved results, because the search task can be satisfied in the list of retrieved results the user vi ews without the need to click through them. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating user satisfaction from the results of searches that are not followed by clickthrough activity to the retrieved results. We found that there is a strong association between some implicit measures of user activity and user X  X  explicit satisfaction judgments. Moreover, we developed a predictive model of user satisfaction based on implicit measures, achievi ng accuracy up to 86%.

Recently, researchers highlighted the need to discriminate between successful and failed searches that are not followed by clicks to the content of the retrieved results [3], [4]. They have reported that the user's inactivit y on search results should not be interpreted as a sign of dissatisfaction from retrieval performance. To this respect, we conducted a user study in order to identify the search intentions of queries with out follow-up clicks to any of the results returned. We also attempt to identify the search tasks that can be accomplished successfully based entirely on information provided on the results page. Additionally, we developed an instrumented browser, QWC Browse r, to collect various measures indicative of user activity after the query submission. Moreover, we examine whether explicit j udgments of user satisfaction are associated to implicit measures of user interest in order to understand which implicit measures are most strongly associated to user satisfaction. Finally, we use Bayesian modeling techniques to develop predictive models in or der to capture user satisfaction from searches that are not followed by clicks to the retrieved results. In order to gather the data required for this study (both implicit measures and explicit feedback), we developed a web browser, called QWC Browser. We recr uited 18 participants that represented the average web searcher and we installed the QWC Browser on their computers. Then , we asked participants to conduct their web searches as they would normally do and use Google as search engine. We expl ained to them that we would record their searches respecting their privacy and anonymity. Our data collection lasted 4 weeks. The idea of utilizing the searcher post-query activity on the returned results as an indicator of implicit relevance judgments is not new [1],[2]. QWC Browser allows us to record users X  actions as they conduct their searches on the Web. Actions included scrolling (both vertical and horizont al), time spent on results page, bookmark, print, move to next results page, time spent moving mouse and copy text from titles or snippets. At the same time, we conducted a user study to identify search tasks related to queries that are not followed by clicks on the retrieved results. Therefore, we examined for which search tasks the user X  X  information needs can be satisfied in the contents of the displayed results. For every query recorded, we asked the participants to answer in four qu estions presented to them via pop-up questionnaire during their search. The first question attempts to capture the user X  X  search goal from a defined list of possible web search tasks. The second one aims to capture user X  X  intention of clicking or not. The third question asks the user if he did click on the displayed results or not. Finally, the last question (prompt only if the answer in previous question is no) captures the reason for not clicking. We examined whether there is an association between implicit measures of user activity and user X  X  explicit satisfaction judgments. Our objective is to model which implicit measures best predict user satisfaction fro m queries not followed by clicks. Based on previous studies on this field [2], we built a Bayesian network model using the collected implicit interest indicators as satisfaction/dissatisfaction. Our findings indicate that in 29.32% of the queries users did not click on any of the retrieved results, either because they were looking for a quick answer to their question in titles and/or snippets retrieved or because their information needs were satisfied by the functionality that the predefined search engine offers (image, news, linguistics). Moreover, we observed that in some cases the search task has a strong association with the user's predetermined intention to click or not (42% of informational task intent not to click, 27% of quick answer intent to click). Additionally, user satisfaction from queries without click, summarized in Table 1, indicates that the lack of clickthrough activity on retrieved results for some types of searches (informational, navigational, trans actional and repeat) is a strong sign of user dissatisfaction. As an example, let  X  convert 233.50 usd to euros  X ,  X  Robert Pattinson  X  be two queries submitted by our participants and their search task were defined as Quick answer and Image relatively. In both cases, the user had no inten tion to click on the retrieved results and he did so, declaring his satisfaction about the search results. We found that time spen t on results page, total time scrolling and copying text from titles and/or snippets are the indicators mostly associated with user X  X  explicit satisfaction judgments. As shown in Picture 1, in 81.5% of the cases that a user spends more than 26 seconds in results page, scrolls more than 7.4secs and copies text from snippets/titles, the retrieved results satisfy his information needs without clicking. We also noticed that there were implicit measures such as print , bookmark and move to next page highly correlated with satisfaction (almost 100% accuracy), but very infrequent (less than 2% of the dataset cases). As described above, we learned a Ba yesian model to predict user X  X  satisfaction by using the implicit measures as input variables. The learned model combining all the implicit measures, described in Section 2.1, was able to predict satisfaction in 86% of cases. abandonment should not uniformly be considered as a negative signal of user satisfaction a bout retrieval performance. Our findings indicate that in nearly 80 % of all searches conducted with initial intention not to click, the user's information need was successfully addressed by the displayed results. In addition, about 45% of all searches not followed by clicks, achieve to find the desired information in the search results X  list. Furthermore, we found that time spent on the results page, the total scrolling time and copying text from titles and/or snippets are the best predictors of user sa tisfaction. We plan to conduct additional studies using different search engines in order to generalize our findings. Moreover, we aim to measure explicit user satisfaction more accurately by using a 1-5 rating scale and detect additional implicit measures , such us query-title overlap, query-snippet overlap, etc. in order to capture user activity more precisely.
