In recent years, the huge evolution of technology has led to the proliferation of artificial dynamic systems that are mostly man made and highly complex. In order to manage such systems by improving efficiency, product quality, environment and safety requirements, the importance of the maintenance and depend-ability analysis has increased. Nowadays, the development of systematic methods for efficient, reliable, and safe design and control of complex industrial systems is a key issue for the research community, as well as for the industrial sector. Examples of such systems are automated manufacturing systems, computer networks, air traffic control systems, transportation systems, healthcare systems, information, communication and infrastruc-ture systems.
 The IFAC biennial series Workshop on Dependable Control of Discrete Systems (DCDS X 07, DCDS X 09, DCDS X 11) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners of the community of safety/reliability analysis of discrete systems with an opportunity to exchange information and new ideas, and to discuss new developments in the field of dependable control of discrete industrial systems.
 This special section of Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence collects six application-oriented papers that were originally presented in the framework of the second IFAC Work-shop on Dependable Control of Discrete Systems, held in Bari, Italy in June 2009. The conference programme included three distinguished plenary talks, 23 invited session papers, and 29 regular papers, which were selected from a total of 75 submis-sions. The authors of seven papers were invited to submit the extended versions of their work to this special section and six of them were accepted after peer review.

The papers in this special section can be divided into different categories on the basis of the approaches and frameworks used to model the systems and to specify the management policies: Bayesian networks (the first four papers), Max-plus algebra (the fifth paper) and the Coloured Petri Nets (the sixth paper). The first paper, by Gabriela Medina, Philippe Weber, Christophe Simon, and Benoit Iung, presents a bibliographical review over the last decade about the application of Bayesian networks to depend-ability, risk analysis and maintenance. The work enlightens the benefits provided by the Bayesian networks to model complex systems, to make predictions and diagnosis, to compute the occur-rence probability of an event, to help user-friendly modelling by a graphical and compact approach.

The following three papers are applications of the Bayesian networks in different application fields in the dependability context. In particular, the second paper by Andrea Bobbio, Daniele Codetta-Raiteri, Stefania Montani, and Luigi Portinale, deals with the modelling of cascading effects in a power grid. The authors model such effects in the form of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) which can be derived by means of specific rules, from the power grid structure expressed in terms of series and parallel modules. Through a case study, the paper shows that in contrast with the available techniques, DBN offer a good trade-off between the analytical tractability and the representation of the propaga-tion of the cascading event.

The subsequent paper of the special section, by Martin Neil, and David Marquez, presents a hybrid Bayesian network (HBN) framework to model the availability of renewable systems. The authors use an approximate inference algorithm for HBNs that involves dynamically discretizing the domain of all continuous variables and use this to obtain accurate approximations for the renewal or repair time distributions for a system. The paper shows the benefit of the HBN algorithms w ith respect to the simulation approaches, since HBN algorithm s can be used to represent repair and support processe s and the durations involved, under any assumptions for renewal time distributions.
 The fourth paper, by Anna Pernest  X  al, H  X  akan Warnquist, and Mattias Nyberg, specifies a decision theoretic troubleshooting system that is devoted to handle external interventions for repairing automotive vehicles at the lowest possible expected costs. To this aim, the proposed troubleshooting system consists of two parts: a planner and a diagnoser. The planner is based on a plan with minimal expected cost that make the vehicle fault free. Moreover, the diagnoser supports the planner with compu-tation of probabilities of faults and of future observations by static Bayesian network.

The fifth paper, by Thomas Brunsch and J  X  org Raisch, presents a max-plus algebraic modelling and control approach for cyclically operated high-throughput screening plants. To this aim, the authors propose a supervisory control scheme using a max-plus algebraic model of the high-throughput screening system. The model is based on the specific operation the user wants to run as well as on the globally optimal cyclic schedule determined off-line. In case of a deviation from the cyclic scheme, the supervisor generates possible actions to be taken, i.e., the controller updates the schedule of the high-throughput screening plant and ensures continuous operation.
 Finally, the last paper, by Maria Pia Fanti, Stefano Mininel, Walter Ukovich, and Federica Vatta, models and analyzes the IHE Alarm Communication Management that establishes a commu-nication standard for alarm messages in healthcare contexts. Aiming at generality, the authors model the system by using the Unified Modelling Language and Coloured Timed Petri nets and consider a general scheme where the message transactions are integrated with the nurse responses. The simulation of a case study illustrates that the model is able to provide support for structured and comprehensive analysis of the healthcare system management.

We would like to express our gratitude to all the people involved in the organisation of the IFAC workshop DCDS X 09: thanks to their effort the event and this special issue have both been possible. Finally, we would like to acknowledge the excel-lent support of the Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelli-gence editorial staff.
