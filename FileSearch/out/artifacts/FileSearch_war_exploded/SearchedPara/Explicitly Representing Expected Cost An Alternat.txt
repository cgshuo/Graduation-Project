 This pap er prop oses an alternativ etoR OC represen tation, in whic h the exp ected cost of a classi er is represen ted ex-plicitly . This exp ected cost represen tation main tains man y of the adv an tages of R OC represen tation, but is easier to understand. It allo ws the exp erimen ter to immediately see the range of costs and class frequencies where a particu-lar classi er is the b est and quan titativ ely ho wm uc hbetter it is than other classi ers. This pap er demonstrates there is a p oin t/line dualit ybet w een the t w o represen tations. A p oin tinR OC space represen ting a classi er b ecomes a line segmen t spanning the full range of costs and class frequen-cies. This dualit y pro duces equiv alen t op erations in the t w o spaces, allo wing most tec hniques used in R OC analysis to b e readily repro duced in the cost space.
 I.2.6 [ Arti cial In telligence ]: Learning| Conc ept le arn-R OC Analysis, Cost Sensitiv e Learning Pro v ost and F a w cett [9] ha v e argued p ersuasiv ely that ac-curacy is often not an appropriate measure of classi er p er-formance. This is certainly apparen t in classi cation prob-lems with hea vily im balanced classes (one class o ccurs m uc h more often than the other). It is also apparen t when there are asymmetric misclassi cation costs (the cost of misclassi-fying an example from one class is m uc h larger than the cost of misclassifying an example from the other class). Class im-balance and asymmetric misclassi cation costs are related to one another. One w a y to correct for im balance is to train a cost sensitiv e classi er with the misclassi cation cost of the minorit y class greater than that of the ma jorit y class, and one w a ytomak e an algorithm cost sensitiv eistoin ten tion-ally im balance the training set. As an alternativ etoaccu-racy ,Pro v ost and F a w cett adv o cate the use of R OC analysis, whic h measures classi er p erformance o v er the full range of p ossible costs and class frequencies. They also prop osed the con v ex h ull as a w a y to determine the b est classi er for a particular com bination of costs and class frequencies. Decision theory can b e used to select the b est classi er if the costs and class frequencies are kno wn ahead of time. But of-ten they are not xed un til the time of application making R OC analysis imp ortan t. The relationship bet w een deci-sion theory and R OC analysis is discussed in Lusted's b o ok [7]. In F a w cett and Pro v ost's [4, 5] w ork on cellular fraud detection, they noted that the cost and amoun t of fraud v aries o v er time and lo cation. This w as one motiv ation for their researc hin to R OC analysis. Our o wn exp erience with im balanced classes [6] dealt with the detection of oil spills and the n um b er of non-spills far out w eighed the n um ber of spills. Not only w ere the classes im balanced, the distribu-tion of spills v ersus non-spills in our exp erimen tal batc hes w as unlik ely to b e the one arising in practice. W ealso felt that the trade-o b et w een detecting spills and false alarms w as b etter left to eac h end user of the system. These consid-erations led to our adoption of R OC analysis. Asymmetric misclassi cation costs and highly im balanced classes often arise in Kno wledge Disco v ery and Data Mining (KDD) and Mac hine Learning (ML) and therefore R OC analysis is a v aluable to ol in these comm unities.
 In this pap er w e fo cus on the use of R OC analysis for the visual analysis of results during exp erimen tation, and the in teractiv e KDD pro cess, and the presen tation of those re-sults in rep orts. F or this purp ose despite all of the strengths of the R OC represen tation, w e found the graphs pro duced w ere not alw a ys easy to in terpret. Although it is easy to see whic hcur v eis b etter in gure 1, it is m uc hharder to determine b yho w m uc h. It is also not immediately clear for what costs and class distributions classi er A is b etter than classi er B. Nor is it easy to \read-o " the exp ected cost of a classi er for a xed cost and class distribution. In gure 2 one curv e is b etter than the other for some costs and class distributions, but the range is not determined b ythe crosso v er p oin t of the curv es so is not immediately ob vious. This information can be extracted as it is implicit in the graph, but our alternativ e represen tation mak es it explicit.

 KDD 2000, Boston, MA USA  X  ACM 2000 1 -58113 -233 -6/00/0 8 ...$5.00 In this section w e brie y review R OC analysis and ho w it is used in ev aluating or comparing a classi er's p erfor-mance. W e then in tro duce our alternativ e dual represen-tation, whic h main tains these adv an tages but b y making explicit the exp ected cost is m uc h easier to understand. In b oth represen tations, the analysis is restricted to t w oclass problems whic h are referred to as the p ositiv e and negativ e class. Pro v ost and F a w cett [9] are largely resp onsible for in tro duc-ing R OC analysis to the KDD and ML comm unities. It had been used extensiv ely in signal detection, where it earned its name \Receiv er Op erating Characteristics" abbreviated to R OC. Sw ets [12] sho w ed that it had a m uc h broader ap-plicabilit y , b y demonstrating its adv an tages in ev aluating diagnostic systems. In R OC analysis instead of just a single v alue of accuracy , a pair of v alues is recorded for di eren t costs and class frequencies. In signal detection these w ere called the hit rate and false alarm rate. In the KDD and ML comm unities they are called the true p ositiv erate(the fraction of p ositiv es correctly classi ed) and false p ositiv e rate (the fraction of negativ es misclassi ed). This pair of v alues pro duces a poin t in R OC space: the false p ositiv e rate b eing the x-co ordinate, the true p ositiv e rate b eing the y-co ordinate.
 Some classi ers ha v e parameters for whic h di eren t settings pro duce di eren tR OC p oin ts. F or example, a classi er that pro duces probabilities of an example b eing in eac h class, suc hasaNaiv eBa y es classi er, can ha v e a threshold param-eter biasing the nal class selection [3, 8]. Plotting all the R OC p oin ts that can b e pro duced b yv arying these param-eters pro duces an R OC curv e for the classi er. T ypically this is a discrete set of p oin ts, including (0,0) and (1,1), whic h are connected b y line segmen ts. If suc h a parame-ter do es not exist, algorithms suc h as decision trees can b e mo di ed to include costs to pro duce the di eren t p oin ts [2]. Alternativ ely the class frequencies in the training set can b e c hanged b y under or o v er sampling to sim ulate a c hange in class priors or misclassi cation costs [3].
 One poin t in an R OC diagram dominates another if it is ab o v e and to the left, i.e. has a higher true p ositiv e rate ( TP ) and a lo w er false p ositiv e rate ( FP ). If p oin tAdom-inates p oin t B, A it will ha v ea lo w er exp ected cost than B for all p ossible cost ratios and class distributions. One set of poin ts A is dominated b y another B when eac hpoin tinAis dominated b y some p oin t B and no p oin t in B is dominated b y a poin t in A. The normal assumption in R OC analy-sis is that these p oin ts are samples of a con tin uous curv e and therefore normal curv e tting tec hniques can b e used. In Sw ets's w ork [12] smo oth curv es are tted to t ypically a small n um b er of p oin ts, sa yfouror v e. Alternativ ely a non-parametric approac h is to use a piece-wise linear func-tion, joining adjacen t p oin ts b ystraigh t lines. Dominance is then de ned for all p oin ts on the curv e.
 T raditional R OC analysis has as its primary fo cus determin-ing whic h diagnostic system or classi er has the b est p erfor-mance indep enden t of cost or class frequency . But there is also an imp ortan t secondary role of selecting the set of sys-tem parameters (or individual classi er) that giv es the b est p erformance for a particular cost or class frequency . This can b e done b y means of the upp er con v ex h ull of the p oin ts, whic h has b een sho wn to dominate all p oin ts under the h ull [9]. It has further b een sho wn that dominance implies su-p erior p erformance for av ariet y of commonly-used p erfor-mance measures [10]. The dashed line in gure 3 is a t ypical R OC con v ex h ull. The slop e of a segmen tof thecon v ex h ull connecting the t w o v ertices ( FP 1 ;TP 1 )and( FP 2 ;TP giv en b y equation 1. True Positive Rate where p ( a ) is the probabilit y of a giv en example being in class a , and C ( a j b ) is the cost incurred if an example in class b is misclassi ed as b eing in class a . Equation 1 de nes the gradien t of an iso-p erformance line [9]. Classi ers sharing a line ha v e the same exp ected cost for the ratio of priors and misclassi cation costs giv en b y the gradien t.
 Ev en a single classi er can form an R OC curv e. The solid line in gure 3 is pro duced b y simply com bining classi er B with the trivial classi ers: p oin t (0,0) represen ts classifying all examples as negativ e; p oin t (1,1) represen ts classifying all poin ts as positiv e. The slop es of the lines connecting classi er B to (0,0) and to (1,1) de ne the range of the ratio of priors and misclassi cation costs for whic h classi er B is poten tially useful, its op erating range. F or probabilit y-cost ratios outside this range, classi er B will b e outp erformed b y a trivial classi er. As with the single classi er, the op erating range of an yv ertexonan R OC con v ex h ull is de ned b y the slop es of the t w o line segmen ts connected to it. Th us the R OC represen tation allo ws an exp erimen ter to see quic kly if one classi er dominates another. Using the con-v ex h ull, p oten tially optimal classi ers and their op erating ranges can b e iden ti ed. One of the questions p osed in the in tro duction is ho w to determine the di erence in p erformance of t w oR OC curv es. F or instance, in gure 3 the dashed curv e is certainly b etter than the solid one. T o measure ho wm uc h b etter, one migh t be tempted to tak e the Euclidean distance normal to the lo w er curv e. But this w ould b e wrong on t w ocoun ts. Firstly , Normalised Expected Cost the di erence in exp ected cost is the w eigh ted Manhattan distance bet w een t w o classi ers, giv en b y equation 2, not the Euclidean distance.
 Secondly , the p erformance di erence should b e measured b e-t w een the appropriate classi ers on eac hR OC curv e. When using the con v ex h ull these are the best classi ers for the particular cost and class frequency de ned b y the w eigh ts w + and w in equation 2. In gure 3 for a probabilit y-cost ratio of sa y 2.1 the classi er mark ed A on the dashed curv e should b e compared to the one mark ed B on the solid curv e. But if the ratio w as 2.3, it should b e compared to the trivial classi er mark ed C on the dashed curv e at the origin. This is the classi er that alw a ys lab els instances negativ e. T o directly compare the p erformance of t w o classi ers w e transform an R OC curv ein to a cost curv e. Figure 4 sho ws the cost curv es corresp onding to the R OC curv es in gure 3. The x-axis in a cost curv eis the probabilit y-cost func-tion for p ositiv e examples, PCF (+) = w + = ( w + + w ) where w + and w are the w eigh ts in equation 2. This is simply p (+), the probabilit yofapositiv e example, when the costs are equal. The y-axis is exp ected cost normalised with re-sp ect to the cost incurred when ev ery example is incorrectly classi ed. The dashed and solid cost curv es in gure 4 corre-sp ond to the dashed and solid R OC curv es in gure 3. The horizon tal line atop the solid cost curv e corresp onds to the classi er mark ed B. The end p oin ts of the line indicate the classi er's op erating range (0 : 3 PCF (+) 0 : 7), where it True Positive Rate outp erforms the trivial classi ers. It is horizon tal b ecause FP =1 TP for this classi er (see b elo w). A t the limit of its op erating range this classi er's cost curv e joins the cost curv e for the ma jorit y classi er. Eac h line segmen t in the dashed cost curv e corresp onds to one of the p oin ts (v ertices) de ning the dashed R OC curv e.
 The distance b et w een cost curv es for t w o classi ers directly indicates the p erformance di erence bet w een them. The dashed classi er outp erforms the solid one { has a lo w er or equal exp ected cost { for all v alues of PCF (+). The maxim um di erence is ab out 20% (0.25 compared to 0.3), whic h o ccurs when PCF (+) is ab out 0 : 3 (or 0 : 7). Their p erformance di erence is negligible when PCF (+) is near 0 : 5, less than 0 : 2 or greater than 0 : 8.
 It is certainly p ossible to get all this information from the R OC curv es, but it is not trivial. The gradien ts of lines inci-den tto a poin tm ust b e determined to establish its op erating range. T o calculate the di erence in exp ected cost, an iso-p erformance line m ust be brough t in to con tact with eac h con v ex h ull to determine whic h p oin ts m ust b e compared. T o nd the actual costs the w eigh ted Manhattan distance bet w een them m ust b e calculated. All this information is explicit in the alternativ e represen tation.
 The second question p osed in the in tro duction w as for what range of cost and class distribution is one classi er better than another. Supp ose w eha v e the t w oh ulls in R OC space, the dotted and dashed curv es of gure 5. The solid lines in-dicate iso-p erformance lines. The line designated A touc hes the con v ex h ull indicated b y the dotted curv e. A line with the same slop e touc hing the other h ull w ould b e lo w er and to the righ t and therefore of higher exp ected cost. If w e roll this line around the h ulls un til it touc hes b oth of them w e nd p oin ts on eac hh ull of equal exp ected cost, for a par-ticular cost or class frequency . Con tin uing to roll the line Normalised Expected Cost sho ws that the h ull indicated b y the dashed line b ecomes the b etter classi er. It is notew orth y that the crosso v er poin t of the t w o h ulls sa ys little ab out where one curv eoutper-forms the other. It only denotes where both curv es ha v e a classi cation p erformance that is the same but sub opti-mal for an y costs or class frequencies. Figure 6 sho ws the cost graph that is the dual of the R OC graph of gure 5. Here it can immediately b e seen that the dotted line has a lo w er exp ected cost and therefore outp erforms the dashed line to the left of the crosso v er p oin tandvicev ersa. This crosso v er p oin t when con v erted to R OC space b ecomes the line touc hing b oth h ulls sho wn in gure 5. T o construct the alternativ e represen tation w e use the nor-malised exp ected cost. The exp ected cost of a classi er is giv en b y equation 3.
 The w orst p ossible classi er is one that lab els all instances incorrectly so TP = 0 and FP = 1 and its exp ected cost is giv en b y equation 4.
 The normalised exp ected cost is then pro duced b y dividing the righ t hand side of equation 3 b y that of equation 4 giving equation 5.
NE [ C ]= (1 TP ) p (+) C ( j +) + FPp ( ) C (+ j ) Then replacing the normalised probabilit y-cost terms with the probabilit y-cost function PCF ( a )as in equation 6 re-sults in equation 7.
 Because PCF (+) + PCF ( ) = 1, w e can rewrite equation 7 to pro duce equation 8 whic h is the straigh t line represen ting the classi er.
 Apoin t( TP;FP ) represen ting a classi er in R OC space is con v erted b y equation 8 in to a line in cost space. A line in R OC space is con v erted to a p oin t in cost space, using equation 9, where S is the slop e and TP with the true p ositiv e rate axis. Both these op erations are in v ertible. So there is also a mapping from p oin ts (lines) in cost space to lines (p oin ts) in R OC space. Therefore there is a bidirectional p oin t/line dualit ybet w een the R OC and cost represen tations.
 Figure 7 sho ws lines represen ting four extreme classi ers in the cost space. A t the top is the w orst classi er, it is alw a ys wrong and has a constan t normalised exp ected cost of 1. A t the b ottom is the b est classi er, it is alw a ys righ t and has a constan tcost of0. The classi er that alw a ys c ho oses negativ e has zero cost when PCF (+) = 0 and a cost of 1 when PCF (+) = 1. The classi er that alw a ys c ho oses p os-itiv e has cost of 1 when PCF (+) = 0 and a zero cost when PCF (+) = 1. Within this framew ork it is apparen tthatw e should nev er use a classi er outside the shaded region of g-ure7asa lo w er exp ected cost can b e ac hiev ed b y using the ma jorit y classi er whic hc ho oses one or other of the trivial classi ers dep ending on PCF (+).
 A t the limits of the normal range of the probabilit y-cost function equation 8 simpli es to equation 10. T o plot a classi er on the cost graph, w e set the p oin t on the left hand side y-axis to FP and the p oin tontherigh t hand side y-axis to (1 TP ) and connect them b y a straigh t line. Figure 8 sho ws a classi er with FP =0 : 09 and TP =0 : 36. The line represen ts the exp ected cost of the classi er o v er the full range of p ossible costs and class frequencies. Normalised Expected Cost False Positive Rate 1 -True Positive Rate This pro cedure can be rep eated for a set of classi ers, as sho wn in gure 9. W e can no w compare the di erence in exp ected cost b et w een an yt w o classi ers. Thereisnoneed for the calculations required in the R OC space, w e can di-rectly measure the v ertical heigh t di erence at some par-ticular probabilit y-cost v alue. Dominance is explicit in the Normalised Expected Cost cost space. If one classi er is lo w er in exp ected cost across the whole range of the probabilit y-cost function, it domi-nates the other. Eac h classi er delimits a half-space. The in tersection of the half-spaces of the set of classi ers giv es the lo w er en v elop e indicated b y the dashed line in gure 9. This e ectiv ely c ho oses the classi er that has the minim um cost for a particular op erating range. This is equiv alen tto the upp er con v ex h ull in the R OC space. This equiv alence arises from the dualit yof thet w o represen tations. In this section w elookatho w the other p erformance criteria discussed b yPro v ost and F a w cett [10] are dealt with in cost space. They are as follo ws: error rate, area under the curv e, Neyman-P earson criterion and w orkforce utilisation. As error rate is pro duced b y setting all the costs in equa-tion 5 to one, the cost graph is easily turned in to an ac-curacy graph. The v ertical distance b et w een curv es w ould then represen t the di erence in accuracy . There is no di-rect mapping of area under the curv ein R OC space to cost space. But w e can measure area under the curv e in cost space and it has an in tuitiv e meaning. Let us assume w e do not kno w the probabilit y-cost v alue used in practice, but w e will use the appropriate classi er on the lo w er en v elop e when it is kno wn. The area under the curv e is the exp ected cost, assuming a uniform distribution p ( x ) where x is the probabilit y-cost v alue (the x-axis in the cost graph). Indeed if the probabilit y distribution p ( x ) is kno wn the exp ected cost can b e determined using equation 11. This also allo ws a comparison of t w o classi ers, or lo w er en v elop es, where one do es not strictly dominate the other. The di erence in area under the t w o curv es giv es the exp ected adv an tage of using one classi er o v er another. Normalised Expected Cost Figure 10: The W eigh ted Sum of Tw o Classi ers Apoin tonan edge of the R OC con v ex h ull is not one of the original classi ers, but it can b e realised b y com bining the t w o classi ers inciden t to it in a probabilistic w a y [10]. The probabilistic w eigh ting is determined b y the distance of the p oin ttoeac h classi er. As the cost graph is a dual represen tation to the R OC graph, there are also duals to op erations, suc h as a v eraging t w o classi ers. In the cost graph, the com bined classi er is a line, sho wn as the dotted line in gure 10. This is just the w eigh ted sum of the t w o classi ers on the lo w er en v elop e, indicated b y the solid lines, that in tersect at a giv en v ertex.
 This b ecomes imp ortan t when considering criteria suc has Neyman-P earson and w orkforce utilisation. The Neyman-P earson criterion comes from statistical h yp othesis testing and minimises the probabilit yof a t yp e t w o error for a max-im um allo w able probabilit y of a t yp e one error. F or our purp oses, this determines the maxim um false p ositiv e rate and the aim is then to nd the classi er with the largest true p ositiv e rate. This can be readily found on an R OC h ull b y dra wing a v ertical line for the particular v alue of FP , as sho wn b y the dashed line in gure 11. The maxi-m um v alue of TP (the minim um probabilit yofat yp e t w o error) is where the line in tersects the h ull.
 The pro cedure is v ery similar in the cost space. Remem-b ering that the in tersection of a classi er with the y-axis giv es the false p ositiv e rate, then a p oin t can b e placed on the axis represen ting the criterion. This is mark ed FP in gure 12. Immediately on either side of this p oin tare the equiv alen t p oin ts of t w o of the classi ers forming sides of the lo w er en v elop e. Connecting the new p oin ttowherethet w o True Positive Rate Figure 11: R OC Curv e: Neyman-P earson Criterion Normalised Expected Cost Figure 12: Cost Curv e: Neyman-P earson Criterion classi ers in tersect automatically giv es the classi er meeting the Neyman-P earson criterion.
 Unfortunately , although the w orkforce utilisation criterion can b e dealt with in cost space, it do es not ha v e the simple visual impact apparen tinR OC space. The w orkforce util-isation criterion is based on the idea that a w orkforce can handle a xed n um b er of cases, factor C in equation 12. T o k eep the w orkforce maximally busy w e w an t to select the best C cases, ac hiev ed b y maximising the true p ositiv e rate. This is realised b y the equalit y condition of equation 12 and True Positive Rate is the line giv en b y equation 13, suc h as the dashed line in gure 13. This line will b e transformed to a p oin t in the cost graph using equation 9 and is sho wn as the small circle on the left hand side of gure 14. The line's slop e is negativ e, resulting in a PCF (+) outside the normal in terv al of zero to one. W emigh t consider it a virtual poin t, but strictly there is no constrain t PCF ( a ) 0 and so this represen ts a v alid p oin t on the line represen ting the classi er. The Neyman-P earson criterion can b e considered a sp ecial case of w orkforce utilisation, when the constrain t only in-v olv es false p ositiv es. So for w orkforce utilisation a similar pro cedure to the one discussed ab o v e could b e used for nd-ing the appropriate classi er. All that w ould be required is to extend the original classi ers out un tiltheyha v ethe same PCF (+) v alue as the virtual poin t. Unfortunately this p oin tma y b e arbitrarily far outside the normal range, whic h militates against easy visualisation. So instead b elo w w egiv e a simple algorithmic solution.
 T o solv e the problem algorithmically in R OC space, a w alk along the sides A, B, C of the con v ex h ull, sho wn in gure 13, w ould be used to nd the in tersection poin t with the constrain t. A t eac h step, the edge is extended in to a line and its in tersection poin t with the constrain t is tested to see if is bet w een the t w o v ertices, represen ting classi ers, that de ne the side. Equiv alen tly in cost space w ew alk a line connected to the virtual p oin t along the v ertices A, B, Normalised Expected Cost Cofthelo w er en v elop e, sho wn in gure 14. A teac h step, the slop e of the line is tested to see if is bet w een the t w o lines, represen ting classi ers, sharing the same v ertex. In b oth spaces the appropriate classi er is found when the test is successful. In cost space, virtual poin ts can be a v oided if w e rearrange the terms of equation 13 and substitute for the gradien t of equation 8 resulting in equation 14. This can be solv ed for eac h p oin t on the lo w er en v elop e. So a w alk along v ertices A, B, C of the lo w er en v elop e w ould pro duce the classi ers represen ted b y the solid lines in gure 14, spanning just the normal probabilit y-cost v alues. NE [ C ]= 1 C In this section w eha v e sho wn that the cost graph, can rep-resen t most of the alternativ e metrics discussed b y Pro v ost and F a w cett [10]. This is not surprising giv en the dualit y bet w een the t w o spaces. But the di eren t represen tations ha v e di eren tin tuitiv e app eal. Certainly for the direct rep-resen tation of costs, the cost graph seems the most in tu-itiv e. Ho w ev er w eha v e also seen that for some metrics lik e the w orkforce utilisation criterion the R OC graph pro vides b etter visualisation. Figure 15 sho ws t w oR OC curv es, in fact con v ex h ulls, rep-resen ted b y the dashed lines. If these are the result of train-ing a classi er on di eren t random samples, or some other cause of random uctuation in the p erformance of a single classi er, their a v erage can be used as an estimate of the classi er's exp ected p erformance. There is no univ ersally agreed-up on metho d of a v eraging R OC curv es. Sw ets and Pic k ett [13] suggest t w o metho ds, p o oling and \a v eraging", and Pro v ost et al. [11] prop ose an alternativ e a v eraging True Positive Rate Normalised Expected Cost metho d.
 The Pro v ost et al. metho d is to regard y , here the true p osi-tiv e rate, as a function x , here the false p ositiv e rate, and to compute the a v erage y v alue for eac h x v alue. This a v erage is sho wn as a solid line in gure 15, with eac hv ertex corre-sp onding to a v ertex from one or other of the dashed curv es. Figure 16 sho ws the equiv alen tt w o cost curv es, lo w er en-v elop es, represen ted b y the dashed lines. The solid line is the result of the same a v eraging pro cedure but y and x are no w the cost space axes. If the a v erage curv ein R OC space is transformed to cost space the dotted line results. Simi-larly , the dotted line in gure 15 is the result of transforming the a v erage cost curv ein to R OC space. The curv es are not the same.
 The reason these a v eraging metho ds do not pro duce the same result is that they di er in ho w p oin ts on one curv e are put in to corresp ondence with p oin ts on the other curv e. F or the R OC curv es p oin ts corresp ond if they ha v e the same FP v alue. F or the cost curv es p oin ts corresp ond if they ha v e the same PCF (+) v alue, i.e. when PCF (+) is in b oth their op erating ranges. It is illuminating to lo ok at the dotted line in the top righ t hand corner of gure 15. The v ertex lab elled \A" is the result of a v eraging a non-trivial classi er on the upp er curv e with a trivial classi er on the lo w er curv e. This a v erage tak es in to accoun t the op erating ranges of the classi ers and is signi can tly di eren t from a simple a v erage of the curv es.
 The cost graph a v erage has a v ery clear meaning, it is the a v erage normalised exp ected cost assuming that the clas-si er used for a giv en PCF (+) v alue is the best a v ailable one. Notably the Pro v ost et al. R OC a v eraging metho d, indicated b y the dotted curv e in gure 16, giv es higher nor-malised exp ected costs for man y PCF (+) v alues. This is due to the a v erage including at least some sub optimal clas-si ers. P o oling, or other metho ds of a v eraging R OC curv es (e.g. c ho osing classi ers based on TP ), will all pro duce dif-feren t results, and all giv e higher normalised exp ected costs compared to the cost graph a v eraging metho d.
 When estimating the exp ected p erformance of a classi er the a v erage should b e based on the selection pro cedure i.e. ho w the curv e will ultimately b e used to select an individ-ual classi er. So far, w eha v e compared curv es without ex-plicitly men tioning a selection pro cedure, but implicitly w e are assuming the selection pro cedure inheren tinusing the lo w er en v elop e of the cost graph and the R OC con v ex h ull: the p oin t selected is the one that is optimal for the giv en PCF (+) v alue. In this case the a v erage based on the nor-malised exp ected cost is appropriate. This do es not mean ho w ev er that other a v erages are incorrect. Eac h is based on a di eren t selection pro cedure whic h will b e appropriate for di eren t p erformance criteria. Pro v ost et al.'s a v eraging metho d is appropriate when the p erformance criterion calls for classi er selection based on FP , suc has the Neyman-P earson criterion. W eha v e just seen that di eren ta v erages of t w ocurv es re-sult from di eren t selection pro cedures, due to the di eren t w a ys of deciding whic hpoin t on one curv e will corresp ond to whic hpoin t on another curv e. A selection pro cedure is also necessary to compare t w o curv es quan titativ ely ,since b yits v ery nature quan titativ e comparison in v olv es summing the di erence in p erformance of corresp onding p oin ts. The selection metho d that is most commonly used in com-paring learning algorithms is parameter-based. F or example, supp ose one wishes to compare t w o learning algorithms and that an R OC curv e is generated for eac h algorithm b y under-sampling or o v ersampling to create v arious class ratios in the training set. T ypically , one w ould compare the p erformance True Positive Rate of the classi ers pro duced on the same training sets: this is c ho osing whic h p oin ts on eac hcurv e corresp ond based on the underlying parameter that generated them rather than on their op erating range. It migh t happ en that algorithm A trained with a 5:1 ratio pro duces a classi er with the same op erating range as the classi er pro duced b y algorithm B with a 10:1 ratio. This could only b e determined b y lo oking at the con v ex h ull or the lo w er en v elop e in their resp ectiv e spaces.
 The fact that the optimal classi er for a particular PCF (+) v alue is not necessarily the one pro duced b y a training set with the same PCF (+) c haracteristics is illustrated in gure 17, whic hsho ws R OC curv es for the sonar data set from the UCI collection [1]. The p oin ts represen ted b y circles, and connected b y solid lines, w ere generated using C4.5 (release 7 using information gain) mo di ed to accoun t for costs (b y altering the v alues inside C4.5 represen ting priors). Eac h poin t is mark ed with the probabilit y-cost ratio used to pro-duce it. If the probabilit y-cost ratio is 11 at the time of application, for example, parameter-based selection w ould select classi er A, since it w as pro duced b y a training set with a 11:1 ratio.
 Using the con v ex h ull selection metho d, the dashed line in gure 17, classi ers w ould b e selected according to the slop e of its sides. This w ould result in the exp ected cost sho wn b y the lo w er en v elop e, the dashed line in gure 18. If instead, the classi ers are c hosen according to the probabilit y-cost ratio input to the classi er, the solid line is pro duced. A probabilit y-cost ratio R is con v erted to a PCF (+) v alue using the PCF (+) = 1 = (1 + R ). In cost space, classi er A will be c hosen when PCF (+) = 1 = (1 + 11) and classi-er B when PCF (+) = 1 = (1 + 5 : 1), as sho wn in gure 18. Changing from classi er A to classi er B w e assume o ccurs at the mid-p oin t of these t w o probabilit y-cost v alues. The area b et w een this curv e and the lo w er en v elop e is a measure Normalised Expected Cost of the additional cost of using this selection pro cedure o v er the optimal one. The large di erence at the left hand and righ t hand sides is due to not using the ma jorit y classi er at the appropriate time. This sho ws the clear disadv an tage of using a classi er outside its op erating range. One limitation of this w ork, whic h is common to that of R OC analysis, is that w eha v e not in v estigated the situation of more than t w o classes. Although the ideas should read-ily extend to three or more classes, the main adv an tage of this approac hisitease ofh uman understandabilit y . Higher dimensional functions are notoriously dicult to visualise and the n um b er of dimensions increases quadratically with the n um b er of classes. Due to the dualit ybet w een the t w o represen tations there migh t b e little merit in using one o v er the other in this situation. Ho w ev er, if the high dimensional space can be pro jected in to a t w o dimensional space, the impro v ed understandabilit yw ould again be an adv an tage. Another limitation is that w e ha v e not in v estigated other commonly used metrics for ev aluating classi er p erformance suc h as lift. One in teresting a v en ue of future researc h is whether or not there are alternativ e dualities based on suc h metrics. This pap er has demonstrated an alternativ etoR OC analy-sis, whic h represen ts the cost explicitly . It has sho wn there is a p oin t/line dualit ybet w een the t w o represen tations. This allo ws the cost represen tation to main tain man y of the R OC represen tation's adv an tages, while making notions suc has op erating range visually clearer. It also allo ws the easy cal-culation of the quan titativ e di erence bet w een classi ers. The fact that the t w o represen tations are dual represen ta-tions mak es it unnecessary to c ho ose one o v er the other, as w eha v esho wn it is easy to switc hbet w een the t w o.
