 Business process modeling is a widely used and accepted technique for capturing, understanding, and analyzing business processes in organizations. One main goal of business process modeling is to visualize processes (1) how they are actually performed (lived process), and (2) how they should be performed (intended process model). To strengthen organizations X  effectiveness (doing the right things) and effi-ciency (doing things right), internal transparency and awareness of the organizations X  business processes is needed. From the workflow perspective, business process modeling plays a key role in the phases design and diagnosis. 
In the design phase, designers usually elicit information about the business process e.g., during workshops and interviews with selected employees (e.g. employees as-signed to particular roles, middle and top management) [1]. At this stage, the process designers face the challenge to tr ansform implicit processes into explicit process models. In the diagnosis phase, which takes place some time after the enact-ment of the (new or improved) workflow system, the task of the designers is to find why they diverge from the intended process [2]. Common practices are, e.g., inter-views, observations and process mining of event logs. Results are used to understand workflow system X  X  support of employees in performing their business. 
In this work, we present a technique of identifying lived business processes by means of To-do X  X  of the performers in a process. Coming from a human-centric per-spective of business processes and workflows, we argue that a bottom-up approach of capturing and documenting actually performed business processes leads to a more faithful process model to reality than a top-down approach. In a bottom-up approach, performed activities and tasks are collected from the performers of the process and are process participants, whereas in a top-down approach the process model is mainly defined considering the knowledge about the company X  X  processes available at vari-ous management levels, e.g. top-level, middle-, and lower management (depending on the company X  X  organizational structure) and the collected data is optionally comple-mented with process information elicited from samples of further process participants. The top-down approach seems to be often used in practice when business processes need to be, e.g. defined and redesigned, as it is a question of time and costs to which phase. 
We assume that personal To-do X  X  implicate information about process fragments understand activities and tasks listed by an individual organizational member in order To-do lists as a resource of the individual used to perform a particular work task. We use the terms activity and task according to the definition of BPMN [3]. 
We use the qualitative content analysis as a technique to capture data of the To-do lists in a transparent, structured, uniform and comprehensive way. The content analy-sis supports the process designer to deal with (1) systematic identification of process elements, (2) homogenization of labels, and (3) granularity of activities. We show how the output of the analysis can be used to model or mine views of individual proc-ess participants and to aggregate and merg e process fragments resulting from To-do X  X  into an entire business process. By the term  X  X rocess view X  we understand a part of a process (process fragment) that is performed by a single organizational member. The method presented in the paper is evaluated in a case study. The work is structured as described in the following. The next section presents the Business Process Model Extraction (BPME) Method that allows a transparent and traceable transformation of process information communicated in natural language to a formal process model. In Section 3 the qualitative content analysis and its potential to deal with challenges particularly arisin g in the context of business process model-ing (level of abstraction, labeling and iden tification of essential process elements) are process model. The case study which was conducted for the teaching process in a real-world setting is presented in section 5. In Section 6 related work is reflected and Section 7 concludes our work. The elaboration of business process models is usually performed according to a com-mon practice. In general, interviews and workshops are conducted in order to ascer-visual and textual illustrations of the process [4]. So far, the step between information language of process participants (humans) into a formal process model. 
Our work concentrated on the analytical and designing step between data collection translate various process elements captured in To-do lists of individuals into a process model in a structured and traceable way. The following challenges are:  X  tools, and decisions, from To-do lists of single organizational members in a struc-tured and traceable way?  X

We propose a reusable semi-structured method that supports the designer to extract process models from text material (e.g. interviews, workshop protocols) in a traceable process elements. Results of the qualitative content analysis serve as the basis for the development of the process model which can be created by modeling or by transform-ing the data into process view logs. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the steps of our method. In a first step, lived processes are elicit from process participants. Second, collected information is analyzed and prepared for further processing. There are two alternative ways of continuing: path A includes the (Step 4). Choosing path B, the designer continues with manually designing process straction level. In the Sections 3 and 4 the steps will be discussed in more detail. mines the quality of the gathered material. In our view, an organizational member knows best what activities he or she actually performs in his or her job and how and when this work is done. To-do lists can be used to capture all the things that need to practical processes of work of single persons. For example, particularly new employ-and  X  X hat is to do in a special case?

Analysis . The To-do lists are examined with the qualitative content analysis. The method supports the designers to identify key process elements (e.g. activities, tasks, roles, agents, time, data, and tools) and terms (e.g. pre-and post conditions). Log preparation. The process views are then transformed into process view logs. can be generated by subsuming To-do X  X  of process members with particular character-istics e.g. acting in the same roles, but also members of the whole process. 
Mining . In contributions related to process mining, processes are commonly con-sidered to be already performed. The resulting process model is automatically derived business process model, as described in this work, processes must not be performed at lists of roles (humans) that are involved in the process. In this section the qualitative content analysis and its potential in the context of busi-ness processes are described. Challenges of analyzing To-do X  X  of process members are discussed, like unique labeling and the level of abstraction of To-do X  X . 3.1 Qualitative Content Analysis in General text [5]. Typically, the content analysis incl udes the steps: unitization, categorization, and coding [6]. Unitization means to divide the textual material into units of analysis analysis to a category. Ideally, more than one coder performs the content analysis in tionalities like coding retrieval, coding frequency, and coding co-occurrences. Exist-ing experiments support automation of the analysis in order to reduce the high manual coding effort of large text material [9]. 3.2 Qualitative Content Analysis in the Context of Business Processes possibility to analyze textual material, e.g. interviews and workshop protocols col-way. Traceability is supported by coding text material, for example process views of individuals, or  X  X rocess stories X , and thus to identify, tag, and cluster essential process particularly in the context of business processes are:  X 
What are the tasks and activities of a particular process view?  X 
What tasks and activities can be subsumed according to their meaning?  X 
What persons and roles are involved in particular tasks and activities?  X 
What tools are used to perform particular tasks and activities?  X 
What kind of data is transferred, where, why and how?  X 
Are there decisions in the process view?  X 
Are there activities performed by several persons and roles?  X  Are there activities in the process view that are delegated? Results of the qualitative content analysis can be interpreted in several ways, but the translated into logs. The latter alternative is described in more detail in Section 4. 3.3 Challenges of Qualitatively Analyzing To-Do X  X  of individual process members that belong to a particular process under investigation. We propose the elicitation of process information by means of To-do lists of individ-ual process members. Several preconditions need to be considered when a qualitative content analysis of To-do X  X  of individual process members is conducted. The procedure of examining To-do X  X  of individual process members based on the portant for extracting business process models in more detail in Sections 3.4-3.6. 3.4 Homogeneity of Activity Labels The labeling of activities as recorded by process members might vary. Synonyms and homonyms need to be handled in order to design an understandable process model inductive and the deductive elaboration of labels. 
Inductive elaboration of labels . Performing the inductive elaboration of labels means to derive labels from the text material. The labels are elaborated in a process of generalization. This procedure is used to attain a close reflection of the language and good as possible. The inductive elaboration of labels can be complemented by the terms X  frequency offer word clouds. When the frequency measure is used to label operations misinterpretation may arise due to technical terms used by persons work-need to be aware of the content of the text material. 
Deductive determination of labels . The deductive determination of labels implies that the labels are defined a priori. This means that the labels are specified before the used in practice, in a particular sector or in a company. Formulations actually used by process members are not explicitly considered in the phase of labeling process steps. 3.5 Dealing with Different Granularity granularity. Summarization is a technique that supports the structured and meaningful aggregation of activities according to their semantic relation [5]. generalization of the paraphrases towards a specified level of abstraction (aggregation to process fragments (aggregation of activities). 3.6 Identification of Process Specifications The identification of process elements is appropriate in the paraphrasing step. In this step the unit of analysis is reduced to its key essence. The key essence of a To-do is the performed task or activity, and is captured in the code by a meaningful noun and a properties associated with the case.  X  Hints to data transfer (data_input and data_output) or events (e.g. eMail, Mail, 
PhoneCall) between two or more process participants (connection). E.g. To-do of the AdministrativeCooperator:  X  X ail lecturing contract to lecturer X . To-do of a 
Lecturer:  X  X eceipt of the lecturing contract in my post office box X .  X  the TeachingCoordinators:  X  X articipation in coordination meeting X .  X  Hints to decisions. E.g. To-do of a Lecturer:  X  X ither I contact the Administrative-
Cooperator if I want to book the lecture hall X or I contact the Secretary if I want to book the lab. X   X 
Hints to delegation. It can be assumed that the To-do X  X  are performed by the proc-ess member who listed the To-do X  X . Otherwise a hint to another person is given. 
E.g. To-do of a ModuleCoordinator:  X  X  lecturer of our lecturer team books a lec-ture hall for all of us X .  X 
Hints to tools used. It might be the case that process participants rather mention the 
E.g. To-do of a Lecturer:  X  X hen I enter the grades of the students into iswi. X   X 
Hints to reoccurring activities. E.g. To-do of a Lecturer:  X  X eoccurring task: con-duction of the units X .  X 
Time notes. We assume that To-do list already reflect a sequential order of the To-do X  X . The first To-do mentioned in the list is the first To-do that is performed by the person in the process under investigation. Explicitly mentioned time notes may be vague but support the designer to sequentially order tasks and activities when sub-suming all tasks and activities of the various process members. E.g. To-do of a Lec-turer:  X  X t the day of the unit I print the attendance list. X , or  X  X efore the semester starts I plan the course X .  X  Name of the agent. The name of the process member is captured as well. Furthermore, process members may mention comments that refer to activities per-Lecturer:  X  X he AdministrativeCooperator books the lecture hall in the system X . logs. We suggest to label such statements as comments to recall the data if necessary. In order to be able to transform results of the qualitative content analysis into process view logs, post conditions of the analysis are listed in the following. According to the BPME method, the designer can choose two alternative paths after analyzing the data. The process view models and the entire process model can be modeled either (1) manually, (2) using a tool that supports scenario-based process modeling like GRETA [1], or (3) the designer transforms the captured process view information into process view logs and entire process logs. In the following we focus process model. We present guidelines for preparing logs based on results of the quali-tative content analysis of process member To-do X  X  in the next section. We want to know how the processes of the individual process members as well as the whole process look like. In order to capture all possible variants of performing proc-ess paths, process view logs for each proce ss participant are prepared for mining. The straction that is included in the original To-do lists (results of the paraphrasing in the qualitative content analysis), as the To-do X  X  reflect the  X  X ental process steps X  of each process participant. For each To-do list a pr ocess view log is elaborated. One output of the log preparation step are logs that re flect To-do X  X  of a process member in a par-view logs reflect process fragment scenarios. The most challenging task for the de-message event between process participants (send and receive), operations that are notes) into concrete (artificial) start-and end date and time stamps. The procedure of considering reference points in the process view logs is described in the following. process views. The output is a process model of the entire process that captures possi-ble variations of process paths by considering the allowed decision combinations. For preparing such logs, the following preconditions need to be considered. whole process with its alternative paths are presented in the following. In addition to the mentioned steps below, exchange with the process participants during workshops might support the analyst to get an immediate  X  X ig picture X  of the whole process and to reduce errors and misinterpretations in the whole process model. 
In this work our intension is not to present a new mining algorithm for process view mining. Our goal is rather to discuss the purpose and benefits of mining prepared logs. constructing and visualizing process models from data analyzed and prepared in a structured and traceable way. The mining of each single log of the individual process signer obtains manageable process views. The process views can be aggregated or merged into one process model. Aggregation of process views means to consider each process view as an instance of the entire process in the logs, whereas merging of proc-process in the logs (compare with Fig. 2). In this section we present a case study in which we applied the BPME method to extract the process model of teaching from To -do X  X  of selected process participants at the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna. For our investigation we considered both the administrative and cr eative process of teaching. A bottom-up form to enable and support teaching at the faculty. 5.1 Collection of To-Do X  X  in the Teaching Process process were asked to list their activities in the process under investigation similar to a scheduled To-do list. The interviews were conducted at the Faculty of Computer survey. The selected persons were directly asked to participate in the study. The par-several roles, e.g. the role of the module coordinator and the lecturer. The interviewer asked for the To-do X  X  of each role successively and recorded the To-do list per role in teaching process were collected (the cases illustrate persons): administrative coopera-16), lecturer team coordinator (case 9), modu le coordinators (cases 10, 11), secretary (case 12), teaching coordinators (cases 13, 14), and technical staff (case 15). 5.2 Content Analysis of To-Do X  X , Log Preparation, and Mining The protocols of the interviews were examined with the content analysis. Most of the activities were described in full sentences rather than by means of cues that are more common in personal To-do lists [13, p. 736]. The text material comprised 16 proto-conducted the content analysis with the demo version of the QDA Miner [8]. Analyz-ing functionalities, like coding frequency allow recognizing reference points among  X  X nquire date and lecture hall X ,  X  X ook date and lecture hall X , and  X  X heck scheduling conflict X  are aggregations of more detailed tasks mentioned as To-do X  X . These aggre-gated tasks were subsumed to  X  X eservation of lecture hall X .  X  X nquire date and lecture hall X  includes two reference points (connections) among process participants. Whereas the lecturers, module coordinators and lecturer team coordinators request for lecture halls, the administrative cooperator and the secretary receive the requests and book the halls. 
Afterwards, each single To-do of the 399 To-do X  X  was coded at the lowest possible level of abstraction already included in the To-do by paraphrasing. 195 labels reflect-among process participants, 39 hints to operations with participation of several proc-ess participants (e.g. meetings), 49 hints to decisions (each operation of the alternative messages), 12 hints to delegation, and 43 time notes could be identified. 8 tools could scheduling sheet X ,  X  X umbers of exams of the last semester X , documented course schedule X ) could be identified. 
In a next step we elaborated the proce ss view logs per process participant (per inclusion of all possible combinations of process paths as these issues were the critical points for the quality of the mining result. Based on the number and conditions of the was used for the transformation of the individual process view logs into process view models. We elaborated process logs in whic h each case illustrates an entire path of the entire process, and considered the course (with unique course ID) as the  X  X ommon case the selected paths of the process views were documented. Log segments were compound to a possible way of the process. The heuristics mining algorithm was used to analyze the entire process logs. Fig. 4 illustrates a comparison of the result of ap-merged To-do X  X  to a process model (left and middle part) and a manually modeled process segment in which BPMN notation was used (right part). The BPMN model segment was designed by the process-aware designer before the To-do X  X  of the proc-ess participants were analyzed and mined. Both segment models gather the same activities (prepare, conduct, and post process unit). 
Whereas the BPMN model provides more details about the participating roles due operations among lecturers before a course unit was conducted). Process design is one of the main phases of the business process life cycle. There are business process (re-)engineering refers to the systematic process exploration based on methods such as interviews and the subsequent modeling of as-is processes, fol-lowed by an optimization of these processes (to-be processes). Much work has been spent on questions such as process modeling notations [17]. Only few approaches tackle process redesign [4]. Although there are known common practices to elicit process models, like questionnaires and workshops, no systematic approach for process exploration and design based on activities and tasks representing practical performed by a single agent of the process (process view logs). 
Commonly, the challenge of finding an appropriate level of abstraction is faced with elimination and aggregation [14] [ 15]. A technique considering the semantic relation between activities is presented in [16]. The meronymy-based aggregation uses business process domain ontologies for abstraction. To enable aggregation, proc-ess model activities are matched to an ontology. The technique offer transparency and this aggregation are a predefined ontology and the use of domain specific labels. [1] proposes a scenario-based modeling paradigm which considers a process model as a set of scenarios. While [1] considers a ll process views and divide them into proc-ess fragments, we consider each proce ss view of each process participant. ited from process participants was handled like a black box, our main research interest of this work was to find out how to translate various process elements captured in To-proposed the Business Process Model Extraction (BPME) method that supports a transparent way of transforming process information in natural language into formal process models. We discussed the potential of the qualitative content analysis in deal-port transparency and traceability up to the final process model, we presented guide-lines to transform results of the content anal ysis into view process logs and discussed two opportunities that lead to an entire process model by mining: the aggregation and the merging of process views. In the case study we showed that the BPME method could be successfully performed. The main challenges faced were the determination of artificial time stamps in the process view logs that were crucial for process mining and the elaboration of the possible process paths based on the decision paths in each process view. The use of the BPME method offered the following outputs: (a) a documented and traceable procedure of tran sforming To-do lists into the process model, (b) illustrative personalized process view models, and (c) an illustrative proc-extend our work on process view mining. Furthermore, we will offer more details about the challenges of the elicitation step of the BPME method, and the validation of the resulting models that should support our approach.
