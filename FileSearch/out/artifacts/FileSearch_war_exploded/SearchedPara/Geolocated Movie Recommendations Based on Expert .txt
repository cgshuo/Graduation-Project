 In this demo, we propose to sh owcase a mobile application for personalized and geolocated m ovie recommendations. While there is a wide range of cinema and movies applications for mobile platforms such as iPhone, ours includes a Recommender System based on Expert Collaborative Filtering that provides recommendations tailored to the user's preferences. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information Filtering Keywords: Recommender Systems, Collaborative Filtering, Experts, Nearest Neighbors, Top-N Recommendations. As explained in previous publica tions (Amatriain et. Al, SIGIR 2009), Expert Collaborative Filtering allows for effective personalized recommendations wh ile addressing many of the shortcomings of traditional CF such as privacy concerns or scalability. It does so by using a limited set of experts/critics that are used as the collaborative base. User preferences, extracted from her own ratings, are only compared to these critic ratings thus avoiding the comparison to all other users, an operation that is traditionally computationally e xpensive and requires for all user ratings to be transmitted to a centralized database. The showcased applicat ion implements this idea on a cell phone to prove the feasibility of the approach In such a setting. Figure 2 illustrates the overall architecture of the application. Information about new movie releases, show times, and critic ratings is crawled from different sources on the web and maintained on a central server. This information is transmitted to the client devices, where all the computati ons take place us ing the locally stored user ratings. It is importa nt to note that personal user ratings never leave the device therefore ensuring full privacy. Our application also uses geol ocation so that recommendations are tailored to fit not only the user preferences but also the local cinema listings. Therefore, the application asks the user to rate films and in return offers movie recommendations that are tailored to the user taste and are playing on a cinema near by. Besides, since personalized recommendations are drawn by finding critics that are similar to the user, these recommendations are likely to avoid other caveats of standard CF such as the cold-s tart problem and natural noise in the ratings.
