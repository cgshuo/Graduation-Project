 KDD Cup , propo sition alization , text classification , information extraction , ROC analyses. KDD Cup 2002 task 2 asked for mod els that predict some specific cellular activity (the AHR signaling pathway) of yeast after the kno ckou t of certain genes. For the proteins encod ed b y the genes, informati on abou t fun ction , localization , and p rotein classes were given, as well as data a bou t pairwise interaction s between them. In add ition , several thou sand abstracts of research p apers on tho se genes and p roteins were provided as a further sou rce of data. Mor e details on the task can b e found in an o verview article by Craven (this issue).
 Our solution is greatly benefiting from an app roach to d eal with relation al i nformation on the interaction o f genes by a propo sition alization algorithm [1] ; we had u sed this s ame algorithm succe ssfully for tasks 2 and 3 o f the prece ding KDD Cup 2001 . We c ou ld achieve a further improvement by using an information extraction algorithm that allowed u s to u tili ze the scientific a bstracts effectively. Propo sition alization is the process of the transformation o f a multi -relation al representation o f data  X  as it can b e found in relation al databases  X  into the form of a single table. RELAGG S (RELation al AGG regation S) [3] compu tes s everal j oins of the inpu t t ables acc ording to their foreign key relation ships. These joins are c ompressed u sing equ ivalent fun ction s to SQL avg, coun t, max, min, and sum, specific to the data types of the table columns, such that the re remains a single row for eac h example, here for eac h gene. Results of several such join compression s are con catenated example -wise. The result i s an app rop riate inpu t for con vention al data mining algorithms.
 For the task at hand , we designed a new schem a of a database that cou ld serve a s inpu t for RELAGG S. We designed a table  X  Gene X  to con tain the names of all genes that were spread o ver the original t ables. Information con tained in the names  X  cf. http://www .un i -frankfurt.de/fb15 /mikro/euroscarf/stra_d es.html  X  as well as the c lass labels were includ ed in this table, see Figure 1. SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 105 gene/protein, respectively. It con ca tenated these results and thu s finally ou tpu t a table with abou t 1,000 columns for further analysis using Joachim X  X  SVM light [2] . In o rder to exploit t he a bstracts provided for analysis, we experimented with two d iff erent app roaches: t ext classification and information extraction . Since there were many missing v alues in the tables, the latter app roach was especially intend ed to find more values for fun ction , localization and p rotein classes.
 For text classification , w e pu t together abstracts per gene, app lied a stemm ing algorithm, and formed a TFIDF representation as an inpu t t o SVM light . The decision fun ction values ou tpu t by this learner served as an add ition al attribu te for the c orrespond ing RELAGG S results.
 For inf ormation extraction , we a gain merged the a bstracts per gene a nd implemented a too l t o efficiently find search terms. These were produ ced from the hierarchy files of po ssible values for fun ction , localization , and p rotein classes acc ording to a few simple r ules, such as the a dd ition o f plural forms to the original lists, e.g.  X  X u clei X  in add ition to  X  X u cleus X . On find ing v alues from ou r search term list, the c orrespond ing original values were includ ed in the a pp rop riate inpu t tables for RELAGG S. As a solution for KDD Cup 2002 task 2, we hand ed in the results of a mod el for the so -called  X  X arrow class prob lem X  a s on e of the two sub tasks of task 2 that i nclud ed the a dd ition al name information , interaction information up to the second level, and results of information extraction . With these prediction s, we c ou ld achieve the best result on this s ub task, and with the very same prediction s, the result on the  X  broad class prob lem X  was s till good enou gh for a good o verall result.
 With class information for tes t examples available no w, we tried to find ou t the influence of the different experimental cond ition s here. For the a dd ition al information from gene names as well as text classification information , we ca n no t ob serve relevant differences. However, using i nteraction information and d ata from information extraction improved the predictive po wer of the mod els, cf. Fig. 2 and 3 . The a pp roach o f propo sition alization in combination with text mining techn iqu es s eems promising as ind icated b y ou r experi mental results. As an add ition , we plan to p erform experiments with a c o -learning algorithm. [1] Cheng, J., Hatzis, C., Hayashi, H., Krogel, M. -A., Morishita, [2] J oachims, T.
