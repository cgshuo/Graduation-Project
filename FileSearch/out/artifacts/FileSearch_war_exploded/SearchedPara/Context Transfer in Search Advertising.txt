 We define and study the process of context transfer in search advertising, which is the transition of a user from the context of Web search to the context of the landing page that follows an ad-click. We conclude that in the vast majority of cases, the user is shown one of three types of pages, which can be accurately distinguished using automatic text classification. H.3.m [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Miscella-neous Experimentation, Measurement online advertising, landing page taxonomy
Unbeknownst to most users, when a query is submitted to a search engine two distinct searches are performed: the or-ganic or algorithmic search that returns relevant Web pages and related data (maps, images, etc.), and the sponsored search that returns paid advertisements. The standard ap-proach to textual Web advertising is based on modeling the user X  X  needs and interests to find suitable ads. In particular, in Web search, numerous studies have focused on classifying the query intent [1, 4, 3, 9] and on retrieving most relevant ads [2, 7, 8]. However, surprisingly little research has been devoted to what actually happens after an ad is clicked.
To this end, we define and study the process of context transfer , that is, the user X  X  transition from her previous ac-tivity (to wit, Web search) to the different contexts found on the landing page after clicking on an ad. Arguably, a careful choice of the type of context transfer is among the most im-portant factors explaining subsequent conversion , that is the occurrence of an activity that was the aim of the advertise-ment (e.g., goods purchase, registration, further browsing).
After reviewing a comprehensive sample of several hun-dred ads and corresponding landing pages, we propose a author was a summer intern at Yahoo! Research.
 taxonomy of ad landing pages, where three major classes combined account for over 88% of the ads in our sample dataset. We then use standard machine learning techniques to build a classifier capable of automatically mapping land-ing pages onto the classes of this taxonomy.
In this section, we discuss our proposed landing page tax-onomy. We compiled a sample set of sponsored search land-ing pages by issuing 200 unique queries to a Web search engine, and randomly selecting the landing page of an ad-vertisement from the sponsored search results. triggered by issuing 200 unique queries to a Web search engine. The queries were randomly sampled out of the 800 labeled queries used for the 2005 KDD Cup [5]. We computed the frequency of each query from Web search query logs. Finally, we used stratified sampling, dividing the queries into deciles accord-ing to frequency, and sampling 20 queries uniformly from each decile. Thus, this dataset was constructed to represent ads that are shown for both popular and rare queries.
We inspected each landing page in isolation, noting its structure, appearance and functionality. We observed sev-eral distinct, non-overlapping classes that sponsored search landing pages fall into. Each class represents a different con-text transfer technique that transitions the user from the search engine result page to the advertiser X  X  landing page. It is interesting to note how much or how little context the advertiser preserves by using each class of landing pages. 1. Homepage This is the top-level page of the adver-tiser X  X  Website. Many advertisers choose to display their home page as a landing page for their ads, often regard-less of the query that triggered the ad. This approach is commonly used by either smaller, less experienced advertis-ers or well known brand-name advertisers that display their homepage when bidding on brand keywords. Unless the user searched for the advertiser X  X  brand name, using the home-page as a landing page does not make for a strong context transfer. For instance, consider a search for the word  X  X oy-ota. X  If Toyota is the advertiser, directing the searcher to Toyota X  X  homepage will likely satisfy the user X  X  information need. On the other hand, any other advertiser that does not have a Website dedicated to Toyota cars, e.g., a Website that provides price quotes for all car makes, would lose some of the context by showing a generic homepage, which does not immediately satisfy the search query (even though the relevant content may be found on the advertiser X  X  Web site by following hyperlinks). 2. Search transfer Landing pages of this type are dynam-ically generated search results on the advertiser X  X  site. Here, the advertiser uses the original Web search query to perform a new search within its own site, and displays the results as the ad X  X  landing page. For example, given a query  X  X alifor-nia Zinfandel, X  an online wine store would return a landing page that dynamically displays their own inventory search results for this query. In such landing pages, context transfer is strong only if the query used to generate the search re-sults corresponds to products, services, or information that the Website offers. However, many advertisers that use this technique do not design their campaigns carefully enough to ensure that all phrases they bid on yield meaningful search results, in which case the context is completely lost. 3. Category browse A Category browse landing page leads the user to a sub-section of the Website that is generally related to the query. This page is not at the top level of the Website (homepage) but could be navigated to from other pages on the site. In our example of an online wine store advertising for the query  X  X alifornia Zinfandel, X  a Category browse landing page might describe the Zinfandel section of the Web site. This is a technique that advertisers can use if the bid phrase refers to either a general class of products or services, or a specific one. If the user is looking for a gen-eral class of products, choosing a Category browse landing page would bring them one step closer to the product they are searching for. If the user is looking for a specific prod-uct, while the advertiser only carries different but related products, showing a category page allows the advertiser to 4. Other These are standalone pages that appear to be disconnected from the rest of the Web site. These pages generally do not have many outgoing links and there is no way to reach them from the home page. Examples of this class include standalone form pages, where the sole purpose of the page is to gather information from the user, and pro-motion pages, which supply promotional information about a product or service. These pages are similar to print ads in a newspaper, and often include phrases such as  X  X ry it now, X   X  X imited time, X  and  X  X pecial offer. X 
We labeled each landing page in our sample dataset ac-cording to the landing-page classes. The following table presents the distribution of labels. Note that the first three classes combined account for over 88% of the ads in our data.
Homepage Search transfer Category browse Other 25% 26% 37.5% 11.5%
To facilitate future research efforts that study context transfer in the proposed framework, we need to obtain a larger set of landing pages and label them according to the taxonomy. For this, we trained a sufficiently accurate clas-sifier using standard machine learning techniques.
To train the landing-page classifier, we used our sample set of landing pages, labeled with the taxonomy classes defined in Section 2. For each landing page in this set, our classi-specific product. For convenience, we include them in the Category browse class.
 Table 1: Performances of landing page type classifier fier assigns one of four labels: Homepage , Category browse , Search transfer , or Other . The features we used include the bag-of-words representation of the visible landing-page text with tf.idf weights, as well as a number of frequently ob-served HTML patterns from the landing-page HTML source. We trained a Support Vector Machine model using Weka X  X  SMO implementation [6] on the reduced feature space in-duced from a supervised attribute selection technique, aim-ing to optimize the accuracy of the most frequent classes that accounted for more than 88% of the data. With 10-fold cross validation on the training data, our classifier accurately predicted the class label for 83% of the examples.
We constructed a separate test set of 100 landing pages, by sampling from activity logs collected from a browser toolbar plug-in. These 100 pages were then manually labeled. We ran the classifier over this test data and it correctly predicted the class label for 80% of the examples. Table 1 presents a breakdown of the performance by class.
In this paper we presented a study of context transfer in sponsored search advertising. By analyzing several hundred examples, we found that the majority of ad landing pages fall into three distinct classes: Homepage , Category browse , and Search transfer . We then built a machine learning classifier, capable of automatically mapping landing pages onto these classes. In future work, we plan to use this classifier to study the effectiveness (e.g., conversion rates) of different context transfer techniques.
