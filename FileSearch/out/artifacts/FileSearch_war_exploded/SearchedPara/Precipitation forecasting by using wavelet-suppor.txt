 1. Introduction
Forecast of precipitation is essential for planning and manage-ment of water resources. But, the temporal and spatial variation of rainfall makes it difficult. Especially, it is important for hydrologists and meteorologists to accurately estimate daily excessive precipitations, which are responsible for some floods. Using some numerical models by Bustamante et al. (1999) and Olson et al. (2004) and physical models by Georgakakos and Bras (1984), studies of rainfall quantitative prediction have been carried out. However, they are not successful enough in forecast-ing precipitation ( Olson et al., 1995) due to inaccurate initial conditions, parameterization schemes of subscale phenomena, and limited spatial resolution ( Ramirez et al., 2005 ). Using a numeric weather model, rainfall prediction is in general depen-dent highly on grid point values. However, it is quite difficult for rainfall as it is variable both in space and time.

In last decades, soft computing techniques has been success-used an artificial neural networks (ANN) for forecasting rainfall intensity fields at a lead-time of 1 h. Navone and Ceccatto (1994) predicted summer monsoon rainfall over India using an ANN. Sivapragasam et al. (2001) forecasted rainfall using singular spectrum analysis coupled with support vector machine (SVM) approach. Freiwan and Cigizoglu (2005) investigated the accuracy of ANN technique for estimating monthly precipitation amount. Marzano et al. (2006) compared the accuracy of ANN approach with the previously developed regression techniques in estima-tion of precipitation intensity. Ingsrisawang et al. (2008) used decision tree, ANN and SVM for short-term rain forecasting. Hung et al. (2009) applied ANN for forecasting rainfall of Bangkok, Thailand. Wu et al. (2010a ,b) used SVM for daily rainfall fore-casting. Dastorani et al. (2010) examined the potential of ANN and neuro-fuzzy models dryland precipitation prediction. Wu et al. (2010a ,b) predicted daily and monthly rainfall time series by using modular ANN coupled with data-preprocessing techni-ques. Moustris et al. (2011) forecasted precipitation of Greece by using ANN method. El-Shafie et al. (2011) used a neuro-fuzzy and ANN techniques for forecasting monthly rainfalls of Klang River in Malaysia. Hong (2008) used SVM and chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm for rainfall forecasting.

The application of wavelet transform for analyzing variations, periodicities, trends in time series has received much attention in recently years ( Smith et al., 1998; Lu, 2002 ; Chou and Wang, 2002; Dai et al., 2003 ; Coulibaly and Burn, 2004 ; Partal and Kucuk, 2006 ; Zhou et al., 2008 ; Santos et al., 2009 ; Kisi, 2007 , 2009; Kisi and Cimen, 2011). Smith et al. (1998) used a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for quantifying streamflow variability.
They suggested that streamflows could be effectively classified into distinct hydroclimatic categories using DWT. Lu (2002) applied wavelet transform for decomposition of interdecadal and interannual components of rainfall data in rainy season.
Chou and Wang (2002) used a DWT for decomposition of unit hydrograph. They employed on-line estimation of unit hydro-graph using the DWT components. Xingang et al. (2003) investi-gated the rainfall spectrum and its evolution of North China in rainy season with summer monsoon decaying interdecadal time scale using wavelet analysis. Coulibaly and Burn (2004) used wavelet analysis to identify and describe variability in annual
Canadian streamflows and to gain insights into the dynamical link between the streamflows and the dominant modes of climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere. Partal and Kucuk (2006) used a DWT for determining the possible trends in annual total precipitation series. They used the precipitation records from meteorological stations of Turkiye and concluded that the trend analysis on DWT components of the precipitation time series clearly explains the trend structure of data. Kisi (2008) predicted monthly streamflows using wavelet network models.
Zhou et al. (2008) proposed a wavelet predictor-corrector model for the simulation and prediction of monthly discharge time series. Kisi (2009) introduced the wavelet-ANN conjunction model for forecasting intermittent streamflow. Nourani et al. (2009) predicted Ligvanchai watershed precipitation using a combined neural-wavelet model. Kisi and Cimen (2011) proposed a wavelet and support vector machine conjunction model for monthly streamflow forecasting. All these studies showed that wavelet transform is an effective tool for precisely locating irregularly distributed multi-scale features of climate elements in space and times.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of wavelet and support vector machine conjunction model for one-day-ahead precipitation forecasting and to compare this with the performance of single SVM and ANN models. The presented study is the first application for forecasting precipitation using wavelet and support vector machine in literature. 2. Support vector machines
The idea of SVMs, which are known as the classification and regression procedures, has been developed by Vapnik (1995) .
Support vector regression (SVR) is used to describe regression with SVMs in the open literature. In regression estimation with SVR we attempt to estimate a functional dependency f  X  x ! between a set of sampled points X  X f x ! 1 , x ! 2 , ...... , x from R n and target values Y  X  { y 1 , y 2 , yy ., y l } with y the x ! current daily precipitation). Let us assume that these samples have been generated independently from an unknown probability 1995):
F  X f f 9 f  X  x !  X  X  X  w ! , x !  X  X  B : w ! A R n , R n -R g X  1  X  where w ! and B are coefficients that have to be estimated from the input data. Herein, the fundamental problem is to find a function f  X  x !  X  A F that minimizes a risk functional:
R  X  f  X  x !  X  X  where l is a loss function used to measure the deviation between the target, y , and estimate, f  X  x !  X  , values. As the probability distribution function P  X  x ! , y  X  is unknown, it cannot minimize
R  X  f  X  x !  X  directly but only compute the empirical risk function as
R f  X  x !  X  hi
This traditional empirical risk minimization is not advisable without any means of structural control or regularization. There-fore, a regularized risk function with the smallest steepness among the functions that minimize the empirical risk function could be used as
R  X  f  X  x !  X  X  R emp  X  f  X  x !  X  X  g J w ! J 2  X  4  X  where g is a constant ( g Z 0). This additional term reduces the model space and thereby controls the complexity of the solution.
For this reason, the following form of this expression can be considered ( Smola, 1996; Cimen, 2008 ):
R f  X  x !  X  hi where C c is a positive constant (i.e., additional capacity control parameter) that has to be chosen beforehand. The constant C influences a trade-off between an approximation error and the regression (weight) vector J w ! J is a design parameter. The loss function in this expression, which is called e -insensitive loss function, has the advantage that we will not need all the input data for describing the regression vector w ! and can be written as l  X  y f  X  x ! i  X  X  X 
This function behaves as a biased estimator when combined difference between the predicted f  X  x ! i  X  and the measured value y is less than e . The choice of e value is easier than the choice of C and it is often given as desired percentage of the output values y
Hence, nonlinear regression function is given by function that minimizes Eq. (5) subject to Eq. (6) as in the following expression (Vapnik, 1995; Gunn, 1998; Cimen, 2008 ): f  X  x  X  X  cing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. The data are often assumed to have zero mean (this can be achieved by pre-processing), so the bias term is dropped. The kernel function is to enable operations to be performed in the input space rather than the potentially high dimensional feature space. Hence an inner product in the feature space has an equivalent kernel in input space. In general, the
Kernel functions treated by the SVR are the functions with the polynomial, Gaussian Radial Basis, Exponential Radial Basis,
Multi-Layer Perception, Splines, etc. The Gaussian Radial Basis function (GRBF) taken into consideration in this study because it is the most common kernel function ( Caputo et al., 2002 ). It can be written as follows:
K  X  x , x
 X  X  exp  X  J x x i J 2 = 2 s 2  X  X  8  X  where s is the Gaussian noise level of standard deviation.
During the learning by SVR the purpose is to find a nonlinear function given by Eq. (7) that minimizes a regularized risk function (i.e., Eq. (5)). This is achieved for the least value of the desired error criterion (for example, RMSE) for various constant parameters Cc , and e and various kernel functions K ( x,x various constant s values. This process was achieved by a program written in Fortran 90. The program also produces the Lagrange multipliers in Eq. (7).
 3. Discrete wavelet transform The theory of wavelet analysis was developed based on the Fourier analysis. A signal is broken up smooth sinusoids of unlimited duration in Fourier analysis. In wavelet analysis, a signal is similarly broken up into wavelets, which are waveforms of effectively limited duration and zero mean. Wavelet analysis is a windowing technique with variable-sized regions. The wavelet analysis indicates a time-scale view of a signal and provides a method of expressing natural phenomena by utilizing their very rudimentary multi-fractal basis. The lower scales refer to the compressed wavelet and are able to follow the high frequency component or the rapidly changing details of the signal. The higher scales represent the stretched version of a wavelet and the corresponding coefficients indicate the slowly changing features of a low-frequency component ( Kucuk and Agiralioglu, 2006 ).
Wavelet function c ( t ) called the mother wavelet, can be defined as compressing and expanding c ( t ): c factor, b is a time factor; R is the domain of real numbers. If c a , b ( t ) satisfies Eq. (9), for the time series f ( t ) energy signal, successive wavelet transform of f ( t ) is defined as W c f  X  a , b  X  X  9 a 9 1 = 2 seen from Eq. (10) that the wavelet transform is the decomposi-transform.
 The successive wavelet is often discrete in real applications. Discrete wavelet transform of f ( t ) can be written as W c f  X  j , k  X  X  a j = 2 0
The most common (and simplest) choice for the parameters a and b 0 is 2 and 1 time steps, respectively. This power of two logarithmic scaling of the time and scale is known as dyadic grid arrangement and is the simplest and most efficient case for practical purposes ( Mallat, 1989). Eq. (11) becomes binary wave-let transform when a 0  X  2, b 0  X  1: W c f  X  j , k  X  X  2 j = 2 and time domain ( b or k ) at the same time are reflected by W transform is low and the time domain resolution is high, a or j becomes small. When the frequency resolution of wavelet trans-form is high and the time domain resolution is low, a or j becomes large ( Wang and Ding, 2003 ).

For a discrete time series f ( t ), where occurs at different t (here integer time steps are used), the DWT can be defined as (Mallat, 1989 ) W c f  X  j , k  X  X  2 j = 2 a  X  2 j , b  X  2 j k .

DWT operates two sets of function viewed as high-pass and low-pass filters. The original time series are passed through high-pass and low-pass filters and separated at different scales ( Kisi, 2009). The time series is decomposed into one comprising its trend (the approximation) and one comprising the high frequen-cies and the fast events (the detail). In the present study, the detail coefficients and approximation sub-time series are obtained using the Eq. (13). 4. Data and statistical analysis
In this study, the daily precipitation data of two stations located in Aegean Region of Turkiye (located in west of Turkiye) are used in this study. The location of the stations is shown in Fig. 1 . Observed data records have been obtained from the DMI (Turkish State Meteorological Services). The observed data is 15 years (5479 day) long with an observation period between 1987 and 2001 (from January 1987 to December 2001) for both stations.

In the applications, the first 12-y ear of precipitation data (4383 day, 80% of the whole data set) are used for training and the remaining 3-year (1096 day, 20% of the whole data set) are used for Izmir and Afyon Station. In this table, x mean , S x , C sx denote the overall mean, standard deviation, skewness, minimum, maximum, lag-1, lag-2 and lag-3 autocorrelation coefficients, respectively. The highest maximum daily precipitation value was observed at the Izmir Station ( x max  X  1080 mm). The observed daily precipitations show quite high positive skewness values ( C and 4.76). It can be seen from the skewness coefficients in the fifth column of Table 1 that the precipitation data show scattered distribution. The data of Izmir Station have more scattered distribu-tion than those of the Afyon Station . The autocorrelations are quite low, showing low persistence (e.g., r 1  X  0.275, r 2  X  0.088, r
The root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute errors (MAE), Nash X  X utcliffe coefficient (NS) ( Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970 ) and correlation coefficient ( R ) statistics are used to evaluate WSVR and SVR model accuracies. The R shows the degree which two variables are linearly related to. Different types of informa-tion about the predictive capabilities of the model are measured through RMSE and MAE. The RMSE sizes the goodness of the fit related to high precipitation values whereas the MAE measures a more balanced perspective of the goodness of the fit at moderate efficiency and indicates the relative assessment of the model performance in dimensionless measures ( Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970). The RMSE, MAE and NS are defined as
RMSE  X  MAE  X  1 N NS  X  1 in which N is the number of data set, Y i is the daily precipitation and bar denotes the mean. 5. Application and results
The wavelet support vector regression (WSVR) models are obtained combining two methods, DWT and SVR. The WSVR model is an SVR model, which uses sub-time series components obtained using DWT on original data. The WSVR model structure developed in the present study is shown in Fig. 2 . For the WSVR model inputs, the original time series are decomposed into a certain number of sub-time series components (Ds). Each com-ponent plays different role in the original time series and the behavior of each sub-time series is distinct ( Wang and Ding, 2003). In WSVR model, the inputs to the model are the Ds of preceding daily precipitation and the outputs are original and current daily precipitation.

The previous daily precipitation time series are decomposed into various Ds at different resolution levels by using DWT to estimate current precipitation value. Four resolution levels (2 X 4 X  8 X 16) are employed in this study. In general, there is log( n ) resolution level, where n is the length of the time series ( Wang and Ding, 2003 ). In this study, 4383 daily data are used to obtain
SVR models for both stations. This approximately gives four resolution levels. The original precipitation input time series of
Izmir Station and their Ds, which are, the time series of 2-day mode (D1), 4-day mode (D2), 8-day mode (D3), 16-day mode (D4) and approximate mode, are shown in Fig. 3 . The correlation coefficients between each D sub-time series and original daily precipitation time series are given in Table 2 for the Izmir and respectively. These correlation values provide information for the determination of effective wavelet components on precipitation.
It can be seen from Table 2 that D1 component shows low correlations for the both stations. The D2 components have the highest correlations. In order to select dominant D components, total absolute correlations are evaluated. The total correlations are given in the last column of the Table 2 . According to the total
Decompose input time series using 
Input time series (e.g., preceding daily precipitations) -400 -200 0 200 400 600
D1 -600 -400 -200 0 200 400 600
D3 0 50 100 150
Approximation correlations, the D2, D3 and D4 components seem to be more effective than the D1. Then, the new series obtained by adding the effective Ds and approximation component are used as input to the SVR model. This summed new series was labeled as DW.
For the Izmir Station, four input combinations based on preceding daily precipitations are evaluated to estimate current precipitation value. The input combinations evaluated in the study are; (i) P (ii) P t 1 and P t 2 , (iii) P t 1 , P t 2 and P t 3 ,(iv) P P The RMSE, MAE, NS and R statistics of SVR models in training and test period are given in Table 3 .The Cc , e ,and s parameters of the optimum SVR and WSVR models are provided in Table 5 .
Table 3 indicates that the SVR model, whose inputs are the precipitations of four previous days (input combination (iv)), has the best accuracy in training period when compared to WSVR. In the test period, however, this SVR model seems to be worse than the others from the MAE and R viewpoints. The training and test performance statistics of the WSVR models are given in Table 4 .In this table DW t 1 indicates the summed series obtained by adding the effective Ds and approximation component at time t 1. Table 4 shows that the WSVR model with three inputs has a better accuracy than the others in training and test periods. It can be seen from Tables 3 and 4 that the WSVR models perform much better than the single SVR models from the various performance criteria viewpoints. For the Izmir Station, the relative RMSE, MAE, NS and R differences between the WSVR (input combination iii) and SVR (input combination iv) models are 35%, 31%, 1502% and 183% in the test period, respectively. The WSVR and SVR forecasts seen that the WSVR approximates the precipitation data better than the SVR. The scatterplots of each model are illustrated in Fig. 5 . It is obvious from the fit line equations and R values that the WSVR model performs much better than the single SVR model. WSVR predicts the maximum peak as 879 mm instead of measured 795 mm, with an overestimation of 10.6%, while the SVR results in 363 mm, with an underestimation of 54.3%. How-ever, the WSVR prediction of the second max peak, 780 mm is 280 mm, with an underestimation error of 64.6%, while the SVR yields as 0 mm. WSVR model seems to perform better than the SVR in forecasting peak precipitations.

For the Afyon Station, also four input combinations are tried based on preceding daily precipitations to estimate current precipitation value. The performance statistics of the SVR model are given in Table 6 . Table 6 , which indicates that the SVR model, whose inputs are the precipitations of four previous days (input combination iv), has the smallest RMSE (32.9 mm), MAE (11.2 mm) and the highest R (0.374) in training period. The RMSE, MAE, NS and R statistics of the WSVR models are shown in Table 7 . From this table, it is obvious that the WSVR model has the best accuracy for the input combination iv. Compared with the SVR models given in Table 6 , the WSVR models provide much better performance than the SVR in daily precipitation forecast-ing. The relative RMSE, MAE, NS and R differences between the WSVR (input combination iv) and SVR (input combination iv) models are 45%, 37%, 320% and 691% in the test period, respec-tively. Fig. 6 illustrates the precipitation forecasts of the WSVR and SVR and the residuals in test period. As it can be seen from the hydrographs and residuals that the WSVR model performs much better than the single SVR model. The scatterplots of each model are demonstrated in Fig. 7 . From this figure the WSVR model seems also to have a much better forecast accuracy than the SVR model. While the WSVR predicts the maximum peak as 344 mm instead of measured 380 mm, with an underestimation of 9%, the SVR computes as 335 mm, with an underestimation of 12%. However, the SVR prediction of the second maximum peak (272 mm), is 16 mm with an underestimation error of 94%, while the WSVR yields 334 mm, with an underestimation of 23%. Here also the WSVR model has the better accuracy.

Also, daily precipitation estimation has been carried out by feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN), for the purpose of comparison. The Levemberg X  X arquardt algorithm is used here for adjusting the weights of ANN model. The sigmoid and linear activation functions are used for the hidden and output node(s), respectively. The hidden layer node numbers of each ANN model were determined after trying various network structures. The optimal ANN structures for each combination are given in Table 8 . In this table, ANN(1,9,1) indicates an ANN model comprising 1 input, 9 hidden and 1 output nodes. The ANN networks training were stopped after 100 epochs since the variation of error was too small after this epoch. The error graph for an ANN model during training is shown in Fig. 8 . Various ANN structures were tried by increasing the number of hidden neurons from 1 to 10. Hecht-Nielsen (1987) suggested an upper limit of (2 n  X  1) hidden layer neurons, where  X  X  n  X  X  is the number of input neurons. The variation of MSE vs the number of hidden nodes for the ANN(1,9,1) model is shown in Fig. 8 in the test period. It is clear from the figure that the 9 hidden neuron has the lowest MSE. The comparison of Tables 3, 6 and 8 indicates that there is a slight difference between the ANN and SVR models. It is clear from Table 8 that the ANN method also have poor precipitation forecasts as found for the SVR method.

In overall, the wavelet and support vector regression conjunc-tion model that is improved combining two methods, DWT and SVR, seems to be more adequate than the single SVR model for forecasting daily precipitations. The original signal (daily precipi-tation time-series in the present study) is represented in different resolution intervals by DWT. In other words, the complex hydro-logical time-series are decomposed into several simple time-series using a DWT. Thus, some features of the sub-series such as its daily, monthly, annually periods can be seen more clearly than the original signal. Setting up a WSVR model, the SVR model is constructed with appropriate sub-series to belong to different scales. Forecasts are more accurate than that obtained directly by original signals due to the fact that the features (such as periodically) of the sub-series are obvious, ( Ning and Yunping, 1998). This is why the WSVR model performs better than the SVR model. 6. Conclusions
The accuracy of WSVR model has been investigated for fore-casting daily precipitations in the present study. The WSVR models were developed by combining two methods, discrete wavelet transform and support vector regression. The WSVR models were tested applying to different input combinations of daily precipitation data of Izmir and Afyon Station located in Eagean Region of Turkiye. The test results were compared with the single support vector regression and artificial neural network models. The comparison results indicated that the WSVR performed better than the SVR and ANN models in forecasting daily precipitations. For the Izmir and Afyon stations, the WSVR conjunction model increased the prediction correlation coefficient and Nash X  X utcliffe coefficient with respect to the single SVR model by 183 X 691% and 1502 X 320% and reduced the root mean square errors and mean absolute errors by 35 X 45% and 31 X 37%, respectively.
