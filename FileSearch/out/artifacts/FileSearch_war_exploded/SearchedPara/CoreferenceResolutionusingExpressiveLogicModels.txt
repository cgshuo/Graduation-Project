 Coreference resolution is regarded as a crucial step for ac-quiring link ages among pieces of information extracted. Tra-ditionally , coreference resolution mo dels mak e use of inde-penden t attribute-v alue features over pairs of noun phrases. However, dep endency and deep er relations between features can more adequately describ e the prop erties of coreference relations between noun phrases. In this pap er, we pro-pose a framew ork of coreference resolution based on rst-order logic and probabilistic graphical mo del, the Mark ov Logic Net work. The prop osed framew ork enables the use of bac kground kno wledge and captures more complex coref-erence link age prop erties through rich expression of condi-tions. Moreo ver, the prop osed conditions can capture the structural pattern within a noun phrase as well as con tex-tual information between noun phrases. Our exp erimen ts sho w impro vemen t with the use of the expressiv e logic mo d-els and the use of pattern-based conditions.

Coreference link ages can be considered as relations be-tween noun phrases. Traditionally , coreference resolution approac hes represen t the corresp onding prop erties or char-acteristics using indep enden t attribute-v alue features over pairs of noun phrases. Eac h feature is treated as a sep-arate and indep enden t piece of information. Coreference resolution is then decided upon suc h indep enden t informa-tion. However, it can be observ ed that the characteristics or prop erties of coreference are not indep enden t as demon-strated by how human comprehends the texts to obtain suc h information. Therefore, dep endency and deep er relations between features can more adequately describ e the prop er-ties of coreference relations between noun phrases.
In this pap er, we prop ose a framew ork of coreference res-olution based on rst-order logic and probabilistic graph-ical net work, the Mark ov Logic Net work (MLN) [4]. Dif-feren t conditions are considered for capturing the implicit relations guiding the interpretation of coreference. The pro-posed framew ork enables the use of bac kground kno wledge and can capture more complex coreference link age prop erties through rich expression of conditions with rst-order logic. Our framew ork can express more e ectiv ely the interaction of di eren t conditions and coreference resolution. Our pre-liminary exp erimen ts sho w impro vemen t with the use of rich expression of conditions, and demonstrate the bene ts of in-corp orating deep er relations in coreference resolution. Model Design
The coreference relation is mainly determined by examin-ing the coherence of noun phrases app eared in texts. The coreference of two men tions indicates that the two men tions possess certain syn tactic or seman tic characteristics. For ex-ample, supp ose that in a text documen t, the men tions \Mary Holida y" and \Ms. Holida y" are coreferen t. It implies that the two noun phrases share the same characteristics, suc h as having the same gender whic h is female. Hence, suc h characteristics pro vide clues for suggesting the existence of a coreference link age between two noun phrases. These char-acteristics form certain syn tactic or seman tic conditions be-tween noun phrases. As a result, we design a mo del that considers the syn tactic or seman tic relationship as evidence for inferring coreference link ages. Generally , let m i and m be two men tions. The follo wing patterns can be observ ed: If two men tions, m i and m j , ful ll certain syn tactic or se-man tic conditions, it increases the likeliho od that the two men tions are coreferen t. For example, if two men tions, suc h as \Mary Holida y" and \Ms. Holida y", have the same gender or share the same sub-string, it increases the likeliho od that they are coreferen t.

In our prop osed mo del, we design rst-order logic form ulae in MLN enco ding the above relationships. Precisely , we rst design the rst-order predicate coref ( m i ; m j ) to represen t the coreference link age between two men tions, m i and m Next, the follo wing logic form ula template is designed: where Condition k ( m i ; m j ) is the condition template repre-sen ting the k th seman tic or syn tactic condition between m and m j expressed in rst-order logic. Eac h form ula instan-tiated from the template in Form ula 1 is asso ciated with a weigh t, w k . For describing the syn tactic and seman tic char-acteristics for men tions, di eren t predicates are designed. Lexical predicates, seman tic predicates and positional pred-icates represen t the common characteristics between men-tions. For example, the two predicates, same str ( m i ; m and shor t dist ( m i ; m j ), describ e whether two men tions are the same and whether they are within a short distance to-wards eac h other in the text. Men tion predicates and gram-matical predicates, suc h as pronoun ( m i ), represen ts the prop-erty of a men tion. Moreo ver, men tion pattern predicates and con textual pattern predicates are emplo yed to capture the structural regularities within a men tion and between pairs of men tions. By instan tiating the condition template, Condition k ( m i ; m j ), with the predicates, the relationships between men tions can be captured.
 Dependency Among Coreference
It can be observ ed that coreference link ages are not in-dep enden t to eac h other. Our mo del pro vides a platform for easily capturing coreference link age dep endency . The coref () predicates can be connected to eac h other, and cap-ture the mutual in uence among themselv es. For example, the transitivit y between coreference link ages can be form u-lated as: 8 m i ; m j ; m k coref ( m i ; m j ) ^ coref ( m j ; m k Expressiv e Conditions
The determination of coreference link age between two noun phrases requires tigh ter coupling between the pieces of in-formation. Di eren t types of predicates are com bined in es-tablishing expressiv e conditions for describing the beha viour of coreference link ages. An expressiv e condition is used to instan tiate the condition template, Condition k ( m i ; m a form ula. For example, the lexical predicates, the gram-matical predicates and positional predicates are com bined to restrict the relationship to be applied on a certain type of noun phrases:
We extracted the English documen ts in the ACE 2004 1 training corpus for our preliminary exp erimen ts. English documen t collection from the news source, broadcast news (BNEWS), was used, The total num ber of documen ts is 220 and it con tains 11,373 men tions. We split the documen t collection by randomly selecting 75% of the documen ts for training and 25% for testing. We rep eated this preparation of random selection of training and testing documen ts and prepared 5 data sets. Exp erimen ts were conducted for all data sets and the average evaluation metric was computed. We consider only the men tions annotated in the ACE cor-pus, referred as true men tions, for our exp erimen ts.
The Alc hem y system [2], whic h pro vides algorithms in sta-tistical relational learning on the Mark ov Logic Net work was used in our exp erimen ts. Discriminativ e learning is adopted
See http://www.nist.go v/sp eech/tests/ace/ for details of the ACE program Table 1: Experimen tal results for coreference reso-lution on the BNEWS documen t collection Basic Coreference Mo del 54.60% 88.38% 67.47%
Full Mo del 54.72% 94.07% 69.18% for training. Our mo del gives a scoring value on eac h pair of men tions. A threshold is then used for classifying a pair of men tions as coreferen t. Based on a preliminary empiri-cal investigation, a threshold value of 0.7 was chosen. Eac h men tion is merged with all of its coreferen t men tions ob-tained from our mo del in an aggressiv e manner. For compar-ativ e investigation, in addition to the exp erimen ts on our full mo del, we also performed exp erimen ts for our basic MLN coreference mo del where conditions are initiated with only one lexical or seman tic predicate. We evaluate the corefer-ence performance by the B-CUBED measure [1].
Table 1 depicts the coreference resolution results. The in-crease in F-measure of the full coreference mo del over the basic coreference mo del demonstrates that coreference reso-lution can bene t from the incorp oration of expressiv e con-ditions. The full coreference mo del greatly impro ves the pre-cision of coreference resolution. The gain can be attributed to the design of more expressiv e coreference conditions.
As the splitting of training and testing sets in our exp eri-men ts and the evaluation metric di er with other works, it is dicult to directly compare our results with previous work. Results on this dataset using the B-CUBED measure were rep orted by Ng [3] using a meta-classi cation approac h. The F-measure on the BNEWS data collection is 65.6%.

Our prop osed framew ork enables di eren t coreference con-ditions to be incorp orated for capturing the implicit rela-tions of coreference. It enables the use of bac kground kno wl-edge and captures more complex coreference link age prop-erties through rich expression of relations. Our exp erimen ts give encouraging results sho wing the bene ts of incorp orat-ing deep er relations in coreference resolution.
