 Data mining research has devel oped many algorithms for various analysis tasks on large and complex datasets. However, assessing the significan ce of data mining resu lts has received less attention. Analytical methods are rarely availa ble, and hence one has to use computationally intensive methods. Randomization approaches based on null models provide, at least in principle, a and problems. complexity]: Nonnumerical Algorithms and Prob lems; H.2.8 [Database ma nagement]: Database Applications X  X ata mining; G. 3 [Probability and Statistics] Heikki Mannila is the director of Helsinki In stitute for Information Technology HIIT, a joint research institute of University of Helsinki an d Helsinki University of Technology TKK, and a professor of computer science at TKK. He has al so worked at University of Helsinki, Technical University of Vienna, Max Planck Institute for Computer Science, Microsoft Research, and Nokia Research Center. He has published two books and ove r 190 refereed articles in computer science and related areas. His specific area of interest is in algorithms for data analysis, and applications in science and in industry. He received the ACM SIGKDD Innovation award in 2003.
