 When a user gives a query, he hopes that the results can incarnate the present situa-tion and are the best content that he demands in extant results. We have the experi-ence that when we search the name of a sport star on Google, Yahoo and Sohu, it is possible that the first page of the three results is not identical! Here, we hope that it can offer all these 3 pages of contents to select. If the query result and experience of the sport fans can be offered in time to share, the problem is solved. The experiences or query results can be organized well in the P2P network[1][2][3][5][6] and it seems to be a safe shortcut to obtaining the valid information more all-sided and more promptly. The problems left are that how to find your needs and how to organize it on the network. its feature of scalability, and also answers the crucial problem in some applications, for example: put forward a catalog services infrastructure for text similarity query; Separat the storage of the routing information from the structural information to reduce the information transfer in the case of node joining or node leaving in P2P network, reduce network transmission cost and obtain a better balance in workload in nodes as well as a better system scalability. In P2P system, it is an important issue concerning how to organize all nodes effi-text similarity query. Commonly, when a P2P network is applied in Web information retrieval, it will not arise that a certain node can completely offer the best matched k records in the nearest neighbor results with the query Q in real network. hard to achieve the dynamic clustering that comes from different nodes owing to the  X  X reference circle X , to organize the information that has similar characters in the different nodes (such as being similar in cluster center vector or containing mutual character items). The composition of this preference circle does not require central-ized catalog information management,inst ead, corresponding preference cluster set of different combinations can be obtained by use of low admission similarity threshold value and based on different query vector. Accurate match will be done by retrieving algorithm in distributed databases[4][7].Obviously, another critical problem that we want to discuss is how to fix the position that matches with the users X  preference. Our solution is: Organize and maintain the routing information borrowing the ideas of the Chord ring. The location of preference circle is maintained by Chord ring, in which same text vector cluster, we adopt the vector character item that cannot be divided as the key, as well as preserve that character item and cluster center vector as structural information of preference to the mapping nodes. Based on such an idea, we imple-ment a prototype system which system structure refers to Fig. 1. In this system, the character routing layer is a Chord ring. As the character item of the preference cluster center vector, the key is used to store and query the routing table in its node. tained according to the Chord protocol and each node is responsible for storing the query routing information of corresponding keys. In the design, each node keeps the information of the preference circle corr esponding to the character item, incarnating the mapping relation between character item and nodes set where the preference circle R there is a preference whose center vector containing t}. All mapping are embodied in the query routing table Query_Router finally as follows: tion, and saves dynamic maintenance and storage of summarization information both in structure and data etc., which can guarantee to increase the efficiency of query routing and decrease the workload of the character routing layer. The following example illuminates that: suppose that the query vector has 2 characters such as "milk" and "bread", being key with "milk", the character item is located to nodes N 1 information to "milk" can be found in preference circle containing preference cluster 1 only. Similarly, "bread" has been located in the N 2 of character routing ring, but, the related information can be found in preference circle which contains the preference cluster 1 and preference cluster 2, and the preference circle involves 2 nodes including N 2 and N 3 . So, relevant information scope concerning query vector can be preliminarily determined. Chord system [5] has proposed a solution to the data source location problem in the P2P system.The query routing method described in our paper adopts the basic Chord mechanism to solve the core routing problem. Every core routing node is not respon-information of preference circle for query routing. The problems should be solved here is the query routing computing, the addition and maintenance of the query routing information. 3.1 Query Routing As one query vector Q is accepted by a routing node, it will process the similarity computing with every center vector FrequentPreference of the relative clusters(See table 1). If the similarity between the vector Q and some FrequentPreference sur-passes the threshold, it will obtain the corresponding node address. The system will carry through the distributed Top-N processing in a distributed database environment which has been discussed in previous chapter. 3.2 New Query Routing Information Joins New query routing information comes from the joining of the new preference cluster. network. The algorithm about how the preference cluster information joins the query routing table is shown as following: the number of the character items of the vector.When the preference joins the P2P network service, the steps for routing information setup are as following: 3.3 Dynamic Maintenance of the Query Routing Table The preference is variable. The center vector of a preference cluster make dynamic adjustment based on the variation of the amount of accessing the text vector in the cluster. In fact, the maintenance of the preference is executed mainly in the preference storage layer(See fig. 1).But this will cause the change of the query routing informa-tion in the character routing layer n (due to the space limitation,how it is modified is not discussed in the paper), that is and FP on the node n. and locate the node on which the routing table corresponding to the character items is. For every corresponding node, the modification of the routing information of it X  X  Query_Router is described by the following algorithm. r is the located node through any character item t (t  X  F i  X  F j ). formation does not use the broadcast mode, and thus does not bring about the cost of the network transmission and the cost of the computation in corresponding node ow-ing to a great deal of additions and deletions of the preference content. We collect experiment data from three subjects,  X  X ood X ,  X  X omputer X , and  X  X ourism X . The data are collected from tens of web site s. The number of data records returned for each search subject exceeds 6,000. The data records are classified based on the web sites from which they are retrieved, and then stored at 20 peers. After that, we perform vector-based search experiment on the P2P system. At least 30 different vectors are created for each subject. We use two performance metrics to evaluate the proposed system. The first metric measures the accuracy of the search results. Specifically, suppose a query is responded with k data records, among which q records are from the k best-matching records in the whole sy stem. We use q/k to measure the accuracy of the search. The second metric is the search efficiency. Let a be the number of the best matched linkage databases that contains the k best-matching records for a query. Let b be the actual number of such databases that respond to the query. The search efficiency is defined as b/a. In the experiments, there are 20 peer nodes and the num-ber of data records to be returned based on document similarity is k = 20. to the number of preference clusters. It shows that the system performs very well and the number of preference clusters does not have significant impact on the performance.
 When the admission threshold is increased, the search accuracy slightly degraded, but the center vector are not admitted; among them, those that are close to the query vec-tor will be missed.We have performed extensive experiments.Due to the space limita-tion,most experimental results are omitted. In this paper, we offer a new query routing infrastructure for web text information uted data sources. The important thing is improving the serial computing method in which locating data resources is realized in the Chord algorithm and several refinement algorithms to the parallel computing, By using these methods, the advantage of the P2P network computation is really utilized thoroughly, the load of the nodes is reduced, and the efficiency of the processing information on the nodes has been promoted.
