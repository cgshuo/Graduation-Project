 The quantity of accessible information has been growing rapidly and far exceeded human processing capabilities. The sheer abundance of information often prevents users from discovering the desired information, or a ggravates making informed and correct choices. This highlights the pressing need for intelligent personalized applications that simplify information access and discovery by taking into account users' preferences and needs. One type of personalized application that has recently become tremendously popular in research and industry is recommender systems. These provide to users personalized recommendations about information and products they may be interested to examine or purchase. Extensive research into recommender systems has yielded a variety of techniques, which have been published at a variety of conferences and adopted by numerous Web-sites. This tutorial will provide the participants with broad overview and thorough understanding of algorithms and practically deployed Web and mobile applications of personalized technologies.

 Algorithms, Design, Experime ntation, Human Factors. Web personalization, recommender systems, user modeling. The sheer quantity of accessible online information has been growing relentlessly and has far exceeded limited processing capabilities of users. Although this abundance of information may be perceived as valuable, it often also prevents users from discovering the desired informa tion, or aggravates making informed and correct choices. This situation manifests in many domains and use cases, and is refe rred to in the literature as the information overloading problem. The information overloading highlights the pressing need for intelligent personalized applications that ease information access discovery by taking into account the preferences and needs of their users. These are exploited in nowadays Web-based and mobile environments for a vari ety of purposes, such as finding relevant news items, filtering out junk emails, recommending products to purchase, summarizi ng long textual documents, re-ordering purchase lists, or adaptiv ely visualizing content for the user. The basis for the personalization in these cases is the so-called user models , which encapsulate a representation of the user's interests and information n eeds, as derived from their past behavior and interactions with the system and other users. One type of personalized application that has recently become popular in the research community as well as in the commercial Web-sites is recommender systems . These provide to users personalized recommendations about services and products they may be interested to examine or purchase. In a sense, recommender systems can be considered complementary to established information filtering tools  X  the former recommend on desired items, whereas the latter filter out the undesired ones. The generation of recommendations ty pically exploits information collected during the past interactions of users with the system and other users, and other availa ble domain information. Two fundamental groups of methods are used in recommender systems: social methods that leve rage the "wisdom of the crowd" and knowledge-based methods that exploit the available domain and expert-engineered knowledge. Research works around the areas of personalization and recommendation technologies have been tremendously popular at recent. In the last decade, exte nsive research into personalized technologies has yielded a spect rum of algorithmic techniques and practical systems, which ha ve been published at a wide variety of conferences (WWW, IJCAI, AAAI, KDD, ICDM, CHI, SIGIR, JCDL, WSDM, ICWSM, and more). These techniques turned out to be practically important and have been adopted by many popular commercial Web-sites (Google, Yahoo, eBay, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, and more). The tutorial will overview this exciting area of research and practice, and the participants will gain a thorough understanding of algorithmic techniques exploited by personalized technologies. The tutorial will also include a number of examples and Web-based systems, which will demons trate the challenges raised by practical deployment of the personalized and recommendation technologies. Topics related to interaction data analysis, decision making, and scalability of recommender systems will give the participants the flavor of challe nges and constraints posed by real-life large-scale personalized technologies. The tutorial on personalized technologies and recommender systems is timely and important. It can draw the attention of the KDD community to these topics, and trigger more works looking at the application of core KDD methods to persona lized user-facing systems. Shlomo Berkovsky is a Senior Researcher at the Digital Productivity Flagship, CSIRO. Shlomo received his PhD (summa cum laude) from the University of Haifa, where his research focused on mediation of user mode ls in recommender systems. At CSIRO he was the Research Leader of the Personalized Information Delivery team and worked on a project focusing on personalized eHealth applicati ons. Shlomo's broad research interests include user modeli ng, Web personalization, and recommender systems. Specifically, he is interested in collaborative and content-base d recommenders, personalized persuasion, privacy-enhanced pe rsonalization, ubiquitous user modeling, personalization on the So cial Web, and context-aware recommender systems. Shlomo is the author of more than 80 refereed papers published in journals, books, and conference proceedings. He published in broad venues (ACM TIST, AI Review, WWW, IJCAI) and in venues focused on personalization and recommender systems (UMUAI, ACM TiiS, RecSys, IUI, UMAP). His paper won the Be st Paper Award of the AH conference and 2 iAward prizes. Shlomo presented 3 keynote talks and 8 tutorials on personali zation and recommender systems, including at WWW, UMAP, and WISE. He served on the organizing committee of 9 conferences (as general, PC, workshops, tutorials, or DC chair) and chaired 14 workshops. Jill Freyne is a Senior Research Scientist at the CSIRO Digital Productivity Flagship. Jill received her PhD from University College Dublin, where her research focused on collaborative, community based Web search. Jill continued her research into personalization and recommender technology as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Clarity Center fo r Sensor Web technologies and IBM Research in Cambridge, MA where she worked primarily on influence in social networking. Since her commencement at CSIRO, Jill X  X  research has focused on recommender and persuasive technologies to impact attitude and behaviour in the health domain. Jill is the author of over 70 publications published in top quality journals and conferences. She holds a strong international reputation and has b een invited to speak at highly regarded institutions including MIT, CMU, and IBM Research. Jill has co-chaired the International Conference on Persuasive Technologies 2013, has organized a national conference, served on the organizing committees of IUI, Hypertext and Recommender Systems conferences, and run several workshops on Recommender System and Social Web. Jill serves as a senior PC member of RecSys and has re viewed for many other journals and international conferences. Jill has taught courses on information retrieval, recommender systems and social media.
