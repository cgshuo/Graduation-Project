 At eBay Market Place , listing conversion rate can be measured by number of items sold divided by number of items in a sample set . For a given item, c onversion rate can also be treated as the probability of s ale. By investigating eBay listings X  transactional patterns , as well as item attributes and user click -through data, we developed conversion model s that allow us to predict a live listing X  s probability of s ale. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of such conversion models. The se model s are highly valuable i n analysis of inventory quality and ranking . Our work reveals the uniqueness of sales -oriented search at eBay and its similarity to general web search problems .

 Online auction , ecommerce , predictive model , ranking . eBay's online inventory is a collection of listing pages that have short lifespan compa ring to that of normal web pages, i.e., listings are generally for sale in days versus months or years availability of web page s. A t present, the majority of eBay's search result page s (SRP) are item based with category navigation. In addition to query -ite m relevance, customer satisfaction is measured by how easily and quickly they can find items they are interested in , and sale transaction efficiency . eBay X  X  search rank er is built on top of intermediate factor models; each targets a specific goal, and can be implemented at different stages of the business workflow. Predicted item conversion model is a lower -tier mo del and computationally intensive . We choose to run such model at listing stages, and append the model outp ut to items as listing attributes. Runtime models are less computationally intensive but can achieve higher accuracy by incorporating observed user behav ioral data . page views, watch and impression count s are also used in the final predictive model . Validation set s were sampl ed without overlapping with the training data . We assum ed that item conversion probability is a multiplication of supply quality and demand attractivenes s. Th e heuristic model assumes independency of supply and demand , therefore it tends to under estimate the interaction or correlat ion among factors on both supply and demand side s. The binary classification model was implemented using curve fitting to capture information gain from predict ing factors . Its accuracy is reported in Table 1 . Gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) gain popular ity in data mining and machine learning community in recent years 3 . GBDT has the reputation of work ing well for non-linear complex classification and regression models with large number of correlated factors. The result is stable even when some important factors are missing at runtime . Our l isting -time conversion prediction model uses only factors known at the listing start t ime. Several predi ctors from the heuristic model we re also used. The binary regression deci sion tree s compute score between 0 and 1 for each item , and the result is stored as item feature. When comparing with the heuristic model, we found GBDT mo del greatly improved the predic tion result of item at listing start -time. To predict conversion dynamically at runtime, we combined the saved listing time prediction score with seller level priors , and a number of dynamic factors observed at listing end time, such as item's recorded impressions, page views , click through rate , etc . We chose to use logistic regression which is lighter in CPU cycles . By incorporating user behavioral information, the runtime model achieved higher prediction accuracy . Comparisons of the prediction results are shown in Figure 2, 3 and Table 1. Our thanks go to eBay Search organization for continuous support.
