 Volume 44 marks the fifth year of the journal Language Resources and Evaluation , which in 2005 replaced Computers and the Humanities in both name and focus. At that time, especially in the light of the enormous success of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC) that began in 1998, it seemed clear that the field lacked a journal dedicated to articles focused on resource creation, annotation, and evaluation. LRE was established to fill that gap. Since then, the journal X  X  success has been literally overwhelming: since May 2005, 361 manuscripts have been submitted to the journal, of which 102 were eventually accepted for publication either as full journal papers or short notes. Many articles went through one or more iterations of revision in response to reviewer comments and resubmission before final acceptance. As a result of the efforts of both reviewers and authors, LRE is now regarded as one of the most highly respected journals in the field.

This issue of LRE , devoted to a selection of best papers from LREC 2008, also includes a few changes to the journal format. As always, the journal will include full-length papers reporting substantial results or providing a substantial survey of some area of the field, but it will now include two additional article types. One, published under the rubric  X  X  X otes and Discussion X  X , includes short papers of up to 8 pages reporting or discussing technical results, providing short reviews or surveys of interest to the journal readership, announcing the availability of new resources and tools, or describing the application of existing methodologies to new languages. The second is a new type of article, consisting of opinion pieces on topics of relevance to the readership as well as grand challenges to the language resources and evaluation community, which will be published in a section entitled  X  X  X erspectives X  X . We especially encourage the submission of pieces for this new section of the journal, which we hope will provide a forum for new ideas as well as evaluation of the old.
LRE serves a broad readership including all brands of computational linguists, field linguists, and humanists, which is evident in the range of topics addressed in published or upcoming special issues of the journal, including Asian Language Processing, Multimodal Corpora, Multiword Expressions, Plagiarism and Author-ship Attribution, African Language Technology, and Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources. The journal is also a venue for special issues comprised of selected papers from major workshops and conferences in the field, such as SemEval, the Linguistic Annotation Workshop, PACLIC, ICGL, and, of course, LREC. We welcome special issue proposals and look especially for proposals addressing cross-cutting topics of interest to the entire range of LRE readers.
Starting later this year, LRE will join forces with the LREC Map effort to monitor the use and creation of language resources and tools. We will ask all authors who submit to the journal to provide information about the resources and tools referenced or described in the submitted article. The resulting  X  X  X ap X  X  of resource creation and use should be not only informative, but also useful for funders and resource providers.

Although not new, we would like to point out that papers accepted for publication in LRE are also published through Springer X  X   X  X  X nline First X  X  service. This service publishes accepted papers online as soon as authors return the corrected proofs. As a result, the electronic versions of all articles are available to LRE subscribers via the Internet weeks or even months before the print version appears. Papers published by Online First are citable by journal title and a unique  X  X  X igital Object Identifier X  X  (DOI), which is registered with the International DOI Foundation and included in the print version when published. This system therefore overcomes the inconve-nience of delays for those who need or want a print publication. Beyond this, we are exploring with Springer the possibility of providing online only publication for certain types of articles, for example, an extensive annotation guidelines document that accompanies a paper or report, which would ensure persistence and citability as well as provide a means for scholarly recognition for development of this kind of material.

As the first major print venue for publications concerned with language resources and evaluation, we believe LRE has helped to foster both academic recognition and the increasing scientific rigor of work in the areas of resource acquisition, creation, annotation, and use, and methods for evaluation of resources, technologies, and applications. We would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the journal, including LRE board members and reviewers, authors and guest editors, and the language resources community as a whole. We very much look forward to working with you in the future to provide a premier journal for the language resources community.
