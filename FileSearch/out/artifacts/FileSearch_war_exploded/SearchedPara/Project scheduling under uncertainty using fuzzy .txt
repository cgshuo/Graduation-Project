 1. Introduction
A project is informally defined as a unique undertaking, composed of a set of precedence related tasks that have to be executed using diverse and mostly limited company resources. Project scheduling consists of deciding when tasks should be started and finished, and how many resources should be allocated to them ( Creemers et al., 2008 ). Project scheduling respecting precedence and resource constraints is a research problem which is generally known to be NP-Hard. Many uncertainties can affect the project scheduling problem and hence increase its complexity ( Bidot, 2005 ). These uncertainties can be grouped into three sub-uncertainties ( Elkhayari, 2003 ).

Among the applications that are considered by this study, we cite the civil helicopter heavy maintenance activity. This activity is almost carried out by an external maintenance center called Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) center that maintains a multi-customers relation. Each customer X  X  helicopter is viewed as a unique project with its release and due date that should be respected. The presence of uncertainties is the major issue of the maintenance activity. How to deal with these uncertainties at the operational level of planning is studied in this paper. A quite similar problem exists in heavy maintenance of (other) complex systems e.g. trains and boats ( De-Boer, 1998 ).
 To deal with uncertainties in project scheduling, Herroelen and Leus (2005) distinguish between five main approaches: reactive scheduling, stochastic project sc heduling, stochastic project net-works, fuzzy project scheduling and proactive/robu st scheduling. Particularly, the fuzzy project scheduling, based on the assumption that task durations rely on human estimations, is used when theory ( Masmoudi and Ha X   X  t, 2010 )(see Section 2.2 ).

Resource availability is one of the important constraints to take into account to obtain feasible scheduling. Thus, two major techniques; resource constrained scheduling (RCS) and resource in fuzzy scheduling literature, dates and durations are considered fuzzy, but deterministic workload plans are provided ( Hapke and Slowinski, 1996 ; Leu et al., 1999 ). In this paper, we deal with fuzzy project scheduling problems and provide a fuzzy solution with a fuzzy workload. A new approach is provided based on the exploit the fuzzy/possibilistic approach to model a new concept that we call fuzzy workload. Secondly, based on this modelling concept, two techniques RCS and RL are generalized to handle fuzzy parameters. Finally, these techniques are supported by adapted Genetic Algorithm and Greedy Algorithm, respectively. specific problem to address. In Section 3 ,werecallsomebasicsof new modelling approach to deal wi th resource management problem in fuzzy area. Sections 5 and 6 contain a generalization of two algorithms to uncertain data: Greedy and Genetic Algorithms. In helicopters maintenance activity. Section 8 is a conclusion of the work. 2. Project scheduling under uncertainty 2.1. State of the art
To deal with uncertainties in project scheduling issues, both scheduling is rather sparse ( Subhash et al., 2010 )andmostofthe efforts concentrate on the Stochastic Resource Constrained Project fuzzy logic has become a very promising mathematical approach to model uncertainty and imprecision in manufacturing problems ( Wong and Lai, 2011 ) and scheduling problems ( Slowinski and
Hapke, 2000 ). Below, how the precedence and resource issues within fuzzy project scheduling are treated in the literature. To deal with precedence constraint, Program Evaluation and
Review Technique (PERT) and Critical Path Method (CPM) are considered. They are based on two successive steps; a forward propagation to determine the earliest starting and finishing dates (and consequently the project duration and the free floats) and a scheduling topic has been devoted to fuzzy PERT and CPM techni-2011 ). In the fuzzy case, forward propagation is done using fuzzy event. Unfortunately, backward propagation is no longer applicable (2003) show that the boundaries of uncertain parameters like the
Fortin et al. (2005) justify the problem complexity and propose uncertainties are represented by intervals.
 To deal with resources in operational level of planning, RCS and
RL techniques are considered. Th e study of fuzzy scheduling has been initiated in Hapke et al. (1994) and Hapke and Slowinski (1996) . Many techniques particularly the serial and the parallel scheduling schemes ( Hapke and Slowinski, 1996 ), and the resource levelling technique ( Leu et al., 1999 ) were generalized to handle scheduling problems transform the fuzzy scheduling into crisp scheduling by applying either alpha-cuts (see Section 4 )ora defuzzification technique. Thus, the y generate deterministic work-load plans ( Hapke and Slowinski, 1996 ; Leu et al., 1999 ). On the to define a new concept of fuzzy workload plan in operational level applied to a real multi-project environment such as the civil helicopter maintenance activity which is described below. 2.2. Helicopter maintenance scheduling problem
Almost the totality of research in helicopter maintenance field are carried out in the military domain. To the best of our knowledge, only few works have been published on civil helicopter maintenance tions. Addressing civil customers involves a great heterogeneity of is between two and three, and the conditions of use can radically contrary, in the military domain, there are important homogeneous fleets, and the missions for which the helicopters are assigned are quite similar. Moreover, the man agement process in Civil MROs is domain, the helicopters maintenance is managed respecting planned and expected missions ( Sgaslink, 1994 ). This is similar to the maintenance of machines in production industry that is managed the civil domain, heavy maintenance is carried out by an external maintenance center that is not concerned by the exploitation, but maintains a highly multi-customers relation, and considers each customer X  X  helicopter as a unique project with its release and due approaches, as can be found in the military domain for important homogeneous fleets and one single customer ( Hahn and Newman,
The helicopter maintenance visits contain planned mainte-nance tasks and also corrective maintenance tasks since several failures are discovered during the helicopters inspections. Pre-cedence constraints exist between the tasks, due to technical or accessibility considerations. Hence helicopter maintenance visits may be seen as projects involving various resources as operators, equipment and spare parts. Minimizing the helicopters immobi-lization gives a competitive advantage to the company. Conse-quently, the management of a maintenance center is viewed as multi-project management, where every project duration should be minimized while respecting capacity constraints.

Managing helicopter maintenance activity is a complex task as that should be taken into account when dealing with scheduling optimization. We can identify three main sources of uncertainty:
Tasks durations: differ according to skills level of assigned operator. It differs also from one helicopter to another accord-ing to the compactness, state, and mission use. Tasks starting dates are consequently uncertain.

Maintenance program updates: manufacturers and authorities send regularly new documents (Service Bulletin, Airworthiness
Directives, etc.) to add, eliminate or modify some tasks from the maintenance program document.

Absence of operators: the unexpected lack of resources causes the delay of several tasks and hence some tasks X  durations are increased.

According to our knowledge, dealing with uncertainties is a main issue of civil helicopter maintenance scheduling problem that has never been studied in the literature. Considering the non-repetitive aspect of the problem (each helicopter has its own history, the customers are numerous and the conditions of use are highly different), the difficulty to predict the exploitation or establish statistics on corrective tasks or tasks X  durations and the very limited available data, we propose a fuzzy set modelling for tasks X  dates and durations, and hence a possibilistic approach instead of stochastic approach. 3. Fuzzy/possibilistic approach 3.1. Fuzzy set modelling
An ensemblist representation can be either a simple interval or a more complex and complete form as triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy profile ( Fig. 1 ). A fuzzy model has the advantage to be supported by the possibility theory (see Section 3.2 ) for decision making.

Zadeh (1965) has defined a fuzzy set ~ A , whose boundaries are membership function m ~ A of a fuzzy set assigns to each element x A X its degree of membership m ~ A  X  x  X  taking values in (0,1].
To generalize some operations from classical logic to fuzzy sets, Zadeh has shown that it was possible to represent a fuzzy fuzzy profile ~ A can be defined as a set of intervals A a A quently easy to use classical interval arithmetics and adapt it to fuzzy profiles. Dubois and Prade (1988) and Chen and Hwang (1992) have defined mathematical operations that can be per-formed on trapezoidal fuzzy sets. Let ~ A  X  a A , b A , c c , d B  X  be two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, then: ~ A ~ B  X  X  a A  X  a B , b A  X  b B , c A  X  c B , d A  X  d B  X  X  1  X  ~ A ~ B  X  X  a A d B , b A c B , c A b B , d A a B  X  X  2  X  min  X  ~ A , ~ B  X  X  X  min  X  a A , a B  X  , min  X  b A , b B  X  , min  X  c max  X  ~ A , ~ B  X  X  X  max  X  a A , a B  X  , max  X  b A , b B  X  , max  X  c ~ A [ ~ B  X  max ~ A \ ~ B  X  min ~
A  X   X 
Other operations like multiplication and division have also been studied. For more details on fuzzy arithmetics, one can refer to Dubois and Prade (1988) . 3.2. Possibility theory
To cope with decision making on fuzzy area, Zadeh (1978) has developed the concept of possibility, based on fuzzy subsets. Possibility theory introduces both possibility measure (denoted P ) and certainty of events.
 To measure the truth of the event t r t , equivalent to t Thus: P  X  t r t  X  X  sup N  X  t r t  X  X  1 sup
Consequently, let t and s be two variables in fuzzy intervals ( Fig. 3 ). Thus:
The expressions (10) and (11) will be considered in Section 4 to define the necessity and possibility of a task to be present between its starting and finishing times. This will permit to deduce the new concept of fuzzy workload. 4. Fuzzy task presence and fuzzy workload
The project dates and durations are represented by trapezoidal task T , and ~ D  X  w , x , y , z  X  its duration. Let ~ F  X  a the task T . Once starting and finishing times of all tasks are defined, several deterministic resource workload plans are estab-lished by applying alpha-cuts ( Fig. 4 ).

In this section, we provide a new technique to deal with fuzzy resource-constrained task scheduling. Instead of applying alpha-cuts on a fuzzy Gantt to get deterministic resource plans, both Gantt and workload plan are considered fuzzy.

Inspired from (10) and (11) , we can define ~ S ; ~ F  X  (resp.  X  domain where the task T presence is necessari ly (resp. possibly) and finishing times of T  X  X . Associated membership functions, m
We can distinguish three different configurations depending on the intersection degree between fuzzy starting and finishing large overlap  X  c S 4 b F  X  .

Task presence distributions are used to build task resource usage profiles in a way that keeps track of uncertainty on starting and finishing times. Hence, the profile reflects the whole possible time interval while giving a plau sible repartition of workload finishing times is studied separa tely within two (symmetric and non-symmetric) distributions of t he workload, used in the schedul-ing optimization algorithms ( Fig. 5 ). 4.1. Configuration without overlap
In the configuration without overlap between the starting time ~ intervals of possibility and necessity:  X  d ; a
F : P  X  1 N  X  1  X  c ; d
S and  X  a F ; b F : P  X  1 N Z 0  X  b ; c
S and  X  b F ; c F : P  X  1 N  X  0  X  a ; b
S and  X  c F ; d F : P Z 0 N  X  0  X  0 ; a S and  X  d F ;  X 1 X  : P  X  0 N  X  0
Then we characterize the probability of task T presence as a wise linear distribution to represent the probability of the presence of task (dashed lines in Fig. 6 ).

Both symmetric and non-symmetric distributions are considered and will be used to establish resource requirement. The symmetric distribution is a particular case, and thus the non-symmetric dis-tribution which is the general one is represented by a compound function depending on different intervals of possibility and necessity:
P  X  t  X  X  evolve from N ( t )  X  l l  X  l r  X  0  X  to P  X  t  X  X  l l  X  l Suppose that the resource requirement of the task is r .
Resource workload then lies in  X  r w , r z , according to the task duration. Fig. 7 b presents the resource profiles L N ( t ) and L
We define the  X  X  X quivalent durations X  X  D N and D P of the areas covered by resource profiles L N ( t ) and L P  X  t  X  : r D  X  r D
In case of symmetric distribution, the link between task duration D and profile parameter l is given by the following formula that expresses the equivalence of resource requirement: r D  X   X  l r D P  X  X  1 l  X  r D N
In general case where distribution is non-symmetric, the link between the task duration and the profile is as follows: r  X  r l l d S b S 2  X  c S a S 2  X  r l r c F a F 2  X  d F b
In case of symmetric distribution, if D N and D P do not match with task extreme durations w and z , i.e. D N o w or z o D the profiles must be modified so that resource workload belongs to  X  r w , r z . The extreme workloads are defined within a mini-mal or maximal values of l , denoted respectively l min and l Hence, the range of l is reduced from  X  0 , 1 to  X  l min , l If D N o w , l min  X  X  w D N  X  =  X  D P D N  X  If z o D P , l max  X  X  z D N  X  =  X  D P D N  X  Fig. 8 shows an example of restricted extreme profiles.
Let us consider the particular case of task with a fuzzy duration, and deterministic starting time ( a S  X  b S  X  c for the task, between s and d F . So the resource chart is fixed, rectangular shaped. One can remark that in this case, the projec-the resource consumption: even with l  X  1, the resource work-load would be underestimated ( Fig. 9 b). Indeed, the surface of the rectangular profile is attained. A similar modification can be done for the minimal duration, when the area of the projected necessity distribution is greater than r w .

These modifications can be generalized to the case with fuzzy times and duration. Then the profiles, if needed, are modified on both sides. The extended maximal profile, defined by  X  a S is used when D P o D r z . Values b 0 S and c 0 F are  X  b S 2  X  D D P  X   X  c F  X  2  X  D D P  X  The reduced minimal profile, defined by  X  c 0 S , d S , a when w r D o D N . Values c 0 S and b 0 F are  X  c S  X  2  X  D N D  X   X  b F 2  X  D N D  X 
Fig. 10 shows an example of modified extreme profiles. 4.2. Configuration with small overlap
For the small overlap configuration (as in the previous config-function (dashed line in Fig. 11 ): p  X  t  X  X  where the higher point  X  a , b  X  is calculated as follows:  X   X  b F a F  X  X  l l d S c S  X  X  X  d S c S  X  X  l r a F b F  X  b  X   X  b F l r a F  X  X  l l 1  X  X  X  l l d S c S  X  X  l r 1  X 
And particularly while l l  X  l r  X  l :  X  b  X   X  b f c s  X  X  l  X  d s a f  X   X  b f c s  X  X  X  d s a f  X   X  25  X 
The b value varies in a range  X  b 0 , 1 and the a value varies in a range  X  a F , d S along with parameters l or l l and l r .
The areas of the projected necessity and possibility distribu-tions are r D  X  r D
If r D N is lower than the minimal workload r w (respectively, r D
P greater than the maximal workload r z ) we use the projection of the presence probability distribution and determine l (respectively, l max ). Given D so that D N o D o D P , r D  X 
In general case where distribution is non-symmetric, the link between the task duration and the profile is given by the following formula: r D  X   X  r l l

For the large overlap configuration (as in the previous config-uration), the general distribution is also represented by a com-pound function ( Fig. 12 ): p  X  t  X  X  the projected necessity and possibility distributions are r D  X  r D P  X 
If the minimal workload r w is greater than zero (respectively, r D P greater than the maximal workload r z ) we use the projection of the presence probability distribution and determine l min (respectively, l max ). Given D so that 0 o D o D P , r D  X 
In general case where distribution is non-symmetric, the link between the task duration and the profile is given by the following formula: r D  X  In case of symmetric distribution, when w 4 0, l min  X  w = D and when D P 4 z , l max  X  z = D P .
 The extended maximal profile, defined by  X  a S , b 0 S , c 0 when D P o D r z . It is the same extended profile as the one of no overlap configurations. The minimal profile is never reduced.
In this section we studied the resource workload for a fuzzy task and provided symmetric and non-symmetric fuzzy distribu-tion for the three possible configurations depending on the degree of intersection between the starting and finishing times. These modelling approaches will be used later to solve fuzzy scheduling problems. 5. Greedy algorithm for fuzzy resource constrained scheduling
The Schedule Generation Schemes (SGS) are the core of many incrementation and the Parallel SGS performs time incrementation ( Kolish and Hartmann, 1999 ). In both procedures, tasks are ranked in some order and scheduled according to resource availabilities. Hapke and Slowinski (1996) have proposed a parallel scheduling time incrementation. However, res ources are considered scarce and deterministic workload plans are d educed within alpha-cuts appli-cationonafuzzyGanttchartasshownin Fig. 4 . The Parallel SGS resource availability test.

Before going in detail through the new fuzzy Parallel SGS, the following subsection is dedicated to explain how to deal with complex configuration while fuzzy resource and fuzzy precedence constraints are both considered, and the consequent subsection will show a list of adapted priority rules to the context of fuzzy multi-project scheduling problem. 5.1. Precedence and resource constrained tasks
When considering a precedence constraint between two tasks, their workload profiles may not overlap because the constraint expresses the fact that the two tasks cannot be performed simultaneously.

Let us consider two tasks A and B so that A precedes B . Their resource consumptions are denoted r A and r B . We assume that the forward earliest times calculation). This means that between the successively induced by A then B . So between the necessity peaks of A and B , we can affirm that an activity will necessarily occur, induced by A or B . This necessary presence of A or B is projected onto the resource load space using the minimal resource require-load profiles of the sequence A -B are defined as follows: L N  X  A -B  X   X  t  X  X  max  X  r A N A  X  t  X  , r B N B  X  t  X  , min  X  r L P  X  A -B  X   X  t  X  X  max  X  r A P A  X  t  X  , r B P B  X  t  X  X   X  37  X 
The probability workload profile is more complex to define. A constructive way can be provided; firstly the distribution of A is defined and then the distribution of B is deduced respecting resources and precedence constraints. Let us consider A without predecessors. Hence, we can assign to A its symmetric distribu-(16), (28), and (35) , and l B is the parameter value of task B distribution while considering l l B  X  l r B .

Once probabilistic distributions of A and B are defined respect-ing resource and precedence constraints, the sum of the two distributions corresponds to the total probabilistic workload: L P  X  A -B  X   X  t  X  X  r A P A  X  t  X  X  r B P B  X  t  X  X  38  X  of these profiles considering updates made by the aforementioned formula gives the total workload. 5.2. Fuzzy priority rules
Priority heuristics using crisp or fuzzy time parameters are found efficient by many researchers either for one project or multi-project scheduling ( Kolish and Hartmann, 1999 ; Browning and Yassine, 2010 ; Hapke and Slowinski, 1996 ). It is generally useful to perform parallel scheduling with a set of rules instead of one as the computational complexity is low ( Hapke and Slowinski, 1993 ). Some rules that appear to be good in minimiz-ing Makespan are presented in Table 1 .

The list is not exhaustive and many other interesting rules could be used, like the Minimum Worst Case Slack ( MINWCS ), the
Minimum Total Work Content ( MINTWC ) and some dynamic and combined rules presented in Browning and Yassine (2010) . 5.3. Fuzzy parallel SGS a loop, we calculate the distribution parameters of each task j ( H then H r j ) task by task within a new Parallel SGS technique based on the new fuzzy workload modelling provided in this paper. The
Av  X  ~ t  X  is the set of tasks whose defuzzification values of ear-~ l  X  ~ t  X  is the least value among the earliest starting times of
A  X  ~ t  X  is the set of tasks that are not yet scheduled and whose
S  X  ~ t  X  is the set of tasks present in ~ t ; a task j is considered as
The considered defuzzification technique is the mean value t  X  X  a t  X  b t  X  c t  X  d t  X  = 4.

This fuzzy Parallel SGS structure is similar to the one provided by Hapke and Slowinski (1996) . However, there are two major differences. First, the possibility to schedule a task is checked according to the resource requirement and resource availability which are deterministic in Hapke and Slowinski X  X  algorithm and fuzzy in ours. Second, to generalize the Parallel SGS dynamic time progression ( Kolish and Hartmann, 1999 ) to fuzzy consideration,
Hapke and Slowinski (1996) consider weak and strong inequal-ities to compare fuzzy times and make the adequate incrementa-tion. In our approach, the same progression technique is considered but, according to our fuzzy workload consideration, an additional specific time progression technique is proposed when at least one task is available for scheduling but not yet scheduled because of resource availability issue.

We mention that the Parallel SGS algorithm is to be run as much time as priority rules we have. Hence, we talk about multi-priority rule method ( Boctor, 1990 ). Other procedures based on Parallel and Serial SGS and called multi-pass methods ( Kolish and Hartmann, 1999 ) can be studied, but this is not the objective of this paper. 6. GA for fuzzy resource leveling
Resource leveling, also called smoothing technique, aims at completing projects respecting their due dates within a resource usage that is levelled as possible throughout the total project durations. Based on the result of the PERT/CPM technique, the result of the resource leveling is a schedule respecting precedence constraints. In this paper, a schedule will be defined by the tasks starting times that are between the earliest and latest starting times.

Many exact and heuristic techniques were developed to solve 1975, the Genetic Algorithm has proven its effectiveness for com-plex problems like particularly the multi-projects and multi-objec-tives scheduling problems ( Kim et al., 2005b ).AGAisasearch que of GA is quite known, thus to get more complete information about it we refer readers to Goldberg (1989) . 6.1. Genetic algorithm description
In multi-projects context, the Resource Leveling Problem can be defined as a set of tasks with precedence constraints and predetermined durations. A schedule is defined by a set of tasks starting times. Let n be the total number of tasks, P be the number of projects to schedule and n j be the number of tasks in project j  X  n  X  S 1 , ... , S ij , ... , S 1 P , ... , S n P P  X  where S ij task i from the project j .

The CPM technique is applied to a scheduling problem without considering resources in order to define the lower and upper bounds ( ES
The objective L is to smooth resource utilization which can be mathematically expressed as follows: L : min where: L the resource leveling index that indicates the sum of r kijt the partial resource k demand of the activity i from the D the projects duration K the number of resource types P the number projects n j the number of tasks in project j k average of resource k per period  X  r n k  X  X 
The issue of applying Genetic Algorithm is to select an appro-priate form of the chromosome representation. In resource leveling problem, the well-appropriate form is the one considering the task starting times as decision variables being coded as genes values. Thus, the sequence of the tasks in the chromosome corresponds to the sequence of tasks project by project sorted by their Id number. its domain rate respecting precedence constraints.

The fitness function needed to evaluate chromosomes is the resource leveling index L defined in (39) . The adopted selection technique is the roulette wheel method that we combine with Elitist method ( Goldberg, 1989 ) in order to improve selection efficiency. Thus, the selection probability for a chromosome k is proportional to the ratio f k = P n pop j  X  1 f j , where f of the chromosome k and n pop is the population size. According to the Elitist method, the best chromosomes of the current genera-tion are kept and preserved into the next generation.
The GA operators are uniform 1-point crossover and uniform mutation. Table 2 presents an example of multi-projects that will be considered afterward to show the different GA operators.
The crossover starts with randomly selecting a cut point and parent X  X  chromosomes. The right parts of the chromosomes are swapped and hence children are generated ( Fig. 17 ).
Some children generated in this way do not satisfy precedence constraints. To deal with this situation, a reparation technique is applied ( Fig. 18 ).

Let k be the one-cut-point value and task T ij the corresponding task of gene k . All the gene values of the successors of k must be checked to deal with precedence constraints. Hence, task k  X  1is repair is needed. The repairing formula is as follows: S  X  max S lj , max where: pred  X  T lj  X  the set of predecessors of task T lj D pj the duration of the task T pj
The mutation consists of randomly replacing at least one gene with a random value within the range of the corresponding task X  X  starting time ( Fig. 19 ).

Let k be a selected gene to mutate and task T ij its associated task. The new value of the gene is chosen randomly between the maximum finishing time of predecessor tasks  X  max p A  X  S  X  D pj  X  X  and the minimum starting time of successor tasks  X  min 6.2. GA generalization for fuzzy resource leveling
Resource Leveling technique for Fuzzy Scheduling Problem is where genetic algorithm is adapted to projects with fuzzy time parameters. The idea in these papers is to make different a -cuts on tasks X  durations to obtain pessimistic and optimistic scenarios for each a -cut, and then apply deterministic Genetic Algorithm to each scenario to find the corresponding best plan.

In this section, a new vision of fuzzy resource leveling is provided. The Genetic Algorithm developed in Section 6.1 copes well with deterministic multi-projects and multi-resources sche-duling problems. To be generalized to handle fuzzy parameters, some useful hypothesis and extensions are suggested, where the main idea is to make just one couple of fuzzy Genetic Algorithm instead of numerous deterministic ones.

A trapezoidal fuzzy number is numerically represented by four deterministic values. Genetic algorithm becomes very heavy in computation when considering four numbers for each fuzzy decision variable. To deal with this problem only one value is considered and then the encoding and decoding of each solution (chromosome) is done according to the principle of linearity that is explained below.
 ~
LS  X  X  ls 1 , ls 2 , ls 3 , ls 4 be the latest starting time of task T value of s 4 between es 4 and ls 4 .Let b  X  X  s 4 ls 4  X  =  X  es simply calculated according to the principle of linearity within s starting times are shown; ~ ES with b  X  1, ~ S 1with b  X  2 = 3, b  X  1 = 3and ~ LS with b  X  0.

Some algorithms in Fortin et al. (2005) are provided to calculate fuzzy latest starting times and fuzzy total floats. However, no algorithms are provided in the same framework to calculate fuzzy latest finishing times. As these parameters are necessary for our study, the following formula is provided to calculate them: ~ LF ij  X  min  X  ~ LS ij  X  ~ D ij , min  X  ~ LS succ  X  ij  X   X  , ~ where: ~ LF ij the fuzzy latest finishing time of task T ij ~ Dd j the fuzzy due-date of the project j
As latest starting times are calculated within the consideration of extreme configuration as explained in Dubois et al. (2003) , the value of ~ LS ij  X  ~ D ij can exceed the range domain of ~ extreme configurations provided by the forward propagation. Thus, Eq. (41) provides meaningful computable results respecting precedence constraints. Considering the same explanation, the finishing time is calculated as follows: ~ F  X  min  X  ~ S ij  X  ~ D ij , ~ LF ij  X  X  42  X 
Once starting and finishing times are calculated for each task, fuzzy workload is established as explained in Section 4 . Sym-metric distributions are considered because tasks are not neces-exactly at the end of A . The concept of possible and necessary criticality is explained in Chanas et al. (2002) .

For each solution (chromosome), the corresponding fuzzy fitness ~ L is calculated as follows: ~ L  X  min
Many defuzzification techniques are provided in literature We can consider the extreme durations w or z to get the corre-sponding optimistic and pessimistic workload plans. Moreover, we can convert the continuous worklo ad plan into a periodic workload plan, and apply the robustness functions defined in Masmoudi et al. (2011c) . In this paper, we solve the problem after applying the projected to the maximum value of the projects duration.
Leu et al. (1999) consider a fuzzy profile to represent the uncertain activity duration and em ploy also Genetic Algorithm and fuzzy set theory to develop a resource leveling model under level the two deterministic problems corresponding to all lower (optimistic) and all upper (pessimistic) bounds. Then, for each deterministic problem, they apply deterministic CPM techniques to get the margin of each activity and apply a deterministic GA-based approach to solve the problem. Finally, for each alpha in  X  0 , 1 they get a solution for the two corresponding deterministic (pessimistic and optimistic) problems. On the contrary, we apply a (1990) to fuzzy activities durations to get the fuzzy times. Then based on the fuzzy modelling of resource usage provided in Section 4 , we proposed a complete fuzzy Genetic Algorithm procedure to generate only one fuzzy solution instead of multiple deterministic solutions.

The two algorithms described in Sections 5 and 6 are basically a generalization to fuzzy area of existing deterministic algorithms such as the Parallel SGS of Kolish and Hartmann (1999) and the Genetic Algorithm for RLP of Leu et al. (2000) . In this paper, we have added a layer of specific treatments to these algorithms to support the new fuzzy modelling of resource workload provided in Section 4 . An application to helicopter maintenance projects is presented in the next section. 7. Application to helicopter maintenance
Uncertainty affecting the scheduling problem in MROs can be managed by a fuzzy set modelling of tasks X  dates and durations based on expert knowledge. For the following, we adopt 4-point trapezoidal number for each uncertain duration and consider several checks to carry out on components from PUMA helicopter: Main rotor: The work is carried out by 1 expert during 35 X 70 h. Propeller: The work is carried out by 1 expert during 70 X 105 h.
Hydraulic system: The work is carried out by 1 X 2 experts during 18 X 35 h.

Each Component Check can be co nsidered as a small project containing several tasks subject to precedence constraints. The MRO X  X  resources (technicians and equipments) are limited, and thus the necessary qualifications to inspect the different components. Hence, the problem is to schedule small projects respecting both precedence constraints and work shop resource constraints.
For each task j , we need to transform the work content p duration D j based on 35-h working week and the number of operators n j assigned to j : D j  X  p j =  X  35 n n j ).
Table 3 contains the instance data on which we will apply our algorithms. Fig. 21 shows the earliest workload plan without consideration of resource constraints. Dealing with resources consideration, additional decisions on MRO X  X  capacities limit and Projects due dates will be specified before the application of the Parallel SGS and the Genetic Algorithm, respectively. As notified before, the defuzzification formula that we have consid-ered is the mean average provided in Dubois and Prade (1987) .By applying other defuzzification functions, we get different results. Finding the best defuzzification technique for our application would be interesting, but, this is out of scope of our study.
For the resource scheduling, we consider the case where three operators are available at one time, only one test bench, one non-destructive testing equipment, and one cleaning machine exist in the workshop. We apply the Parallel SGS with the consideration of the aforementioned priority rules and the best result is provided by the LPRW rule. Fig. 22 shows the result.

For the Genetic Algorithm, we considered the due date of the three projects equal to 10 days. The values of the GA are chosen as follows: n pop : population size  X  n pop  X  60  X  .
 m n : the best candidates to keep  X  m n  X  max  X  2 , n pop = 20  X  X  . m k : number of candidate to crossover  X  m k  X  2 n round  X  2 n  X  n pop m n  X  = 5  X  X  . m d : number of candidate to mutate  X  d  X  round  X  3 n  X  n pop m n  X  = 5  X  X  . gmut : number of genes to mutate by candidate  X  gmut  X  min  X  2 , round  X  n = 10  X  X  X  . n iter : number of iterations  X  n iter  X  14  X  . n stop : stop algorithm condition (with n stop  X  5, if the result is the same for five successive iterations then stop algorithm).
Figs. 23 and 24 show the result and the convergence of the GA, respectively. 8. Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a fuzzy model for project scheduling problems. A method to establish a resource workload is proposed for both tactical and operational levels of planning. Provided models are applied to the helicopter maintenance domain.
Based on these modelling approaches, some recent papers provide a generalization of several scheduling heuristics to handle fuzzy parameters; a Genetic Algorithm is generalized to solve Fuzzy Resource Levelling problem ( Masmoudi and Ha X   X  t, 2011b )anda
Parallel SGS is generalized to solve Fuzzy RCSPS problem ( Masmoudi and Ha X   X  t, 2011a ). These two techniques can be applied simulta-neously within a decisional loop handling projects due dates and production capacity simultaneously i.e. we can increase/decrease a project due date and apply resource leveling technique or increase/ decrease the production capacity and apply Resource scheduling technique ( Kim et al., 2005a ). Future work will focus on applying parison of our fuzzy approaches (m odels and solving techniques) to existing stochastic ones is unde r study. The afore developed fuzzy techniques will be included into a Decisional Support System to manage a Maintenance Repair and Overhaul center.
