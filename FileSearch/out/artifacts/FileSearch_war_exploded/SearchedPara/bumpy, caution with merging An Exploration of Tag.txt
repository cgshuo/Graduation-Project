 We introduced tags into the Cyclopath geographic wiki for bicyclists. To promote the creation of useful tags, we made tags wiki objects, giving ownership of tag applications to t he community, not to individuals. We also introduced a novel interface that lets users fine-tune their routing preferenc es with tags. We analyzed the Cyclopath tagging vocabulary, the relationship of tags to existing annotation techniques (notes and ratings), and the roles users take on with respect to tagging, notes, and ratings. Our findings are: two distinc t tagging vocabularies have emerged, one around each of the two main types of geographic objects in Cyclopath; tags and notes have overlapping content but serve distinct purposes ; users employ both ratings and tags to express their route-finding preferences, and use of the two techniques is mod-erately correlated; and users are highly specialized in the ir use of tags and notes. These findings suggest new design op-portunities, including semi-automated methods to infer ne w annotations in a geographic context.

Tagging has become a ubiquitous information manage-ment technique on the Web. Users can apply tags  X  short textual labels  X  to items of interest and use these tags to browse and search for items.

This is a new and distinctive context for the design and analysis of tagging systems for several reasons:

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first sketch related work and then describe the design of tagging in Cyclopath. We devote most of the paper to describing the methods we used to investigate our research questions, our findings, and their implications. We conclude with a brief summary and discussion of future work. Many web sites let end users edit geographic content. Google Maps lets users edit the locations of searched-for places and add new places. Google My Maps goes further, enabling collaborative editing of geographic points, path s, and polygons, all of which can be annotated with text, im-ages, and videos. Sites like FixMyStreet and SeeClickFix let users plot the location of potholes and similar problems on a map. Open Street Map is a large project to build a worldwide street map with a wiki. Google Map Maker lets users directly edit Google Maps data (in some countries) and submit those changes for inclusion in the public map. There is a growing body of scholarly work on these systems, including multiple studies of Cyclopath [8, 9, 10] and an analysis of how FixMyStreet facilitates citizen-governme nt interaction [6].

We extend previous work by examining the design choices required to add tagging to a geowiki and analyzing a year X  X  worth of user tagging behavior.

Geotagging is a distinct idea: adding geographical meta-data (typically latitude and longitude) to content like web pages and photographs (as in Flickr). We look at almost the opposite situation: adding tags to existing geographic dat a.
Tagging is an active research area, including studies of algorithms to suggest tags to users [3, 12], evaluations of tag clouds [11], and studies of tagging in an enterprise in-formation sharing system [7]. Two strands of work are most relevant to ours: analysis of the vocabularies that emerge i n tagging systems and studies of how tags relate to associated techniques like recommender systems.

Vocabulary analysis . Research includes information theoretic analysis of the overall structure and evolution o f tagging vocabularies [2], empirical analysis of what const i-tutes  X  X uality X  for tags [13], and several schemes for cate-gorizing tags [4, 12]. We use the categories introduced by Sen et al. [12] to analyze the Cyclopath tagging vocabulary.
Tags and associated techniques . A large body of work explores various ways to integrate tags and recommender systems, e.g., using tags to infer user preferences for item s and improve recommendation algorithms [14, 16, 21] and us-ing tags to explain recommendations [18]. Other work has investigated the relationship between the text of web pages and the tags applied to web pages, finding that 50% of tags were present in the text of web pages to which they were applied [5]. In this research, we examine the relationship between preferences expressed through tags and through rat -ings, and we compare the content and usage patterns of tags to textual annotations.
Prior research on a variety of online communities has found that users take on specialized roles. In online discus -sion forums, Turner et al. [17] and Welser et al. [19] identif y different roles that users assume, notably  X  X uestion Per-son X  and  X  X nswer Person X . In Wikipedia, Welser et al. [20] mapped out various roles that contributors can play, such as technical editors, substantive experts, vandal fighters, a nd social networkers. Bryant et al. [1] found that Wikipedia editors shifted concerns as they became more experienced, evolving from a focus on topics about which they had some personal expertise to taking on different types of  X  X ommu-nity maintenance X , e.g. monitoring for vandalism and enfor c-ing policies like  X  X eutral Point of View X .

Compared to prior work, we investigate a particular type of specialization: how Cyclopath users balance their choic e of annotation roles, techniques, and objects.
Cyclopath is a geographic wiki and route finding system for bicyclists which has been publicly available since Augu st 2008. Over 2,000 people have registered for the site. During riding season, several dozen users log in each day, more than one hundred anonymous users visit, and collectively they re -quest 150-250 routes per day. Users have rated about 70,000 blocks and made over 10,000 revisions to the map.
We faced a number of choices when we designed the Cy-clopath tagging system. Most notably, we had to decide whether tags should be normal objects in the wiki model. For our purposes, the key properties of wiki objects are:
We can interpret the implications of making tags normal wiki objects in the framework of Sen et al. [12]. Wiki-tags would be completely open or public on the sharing dimen-sion. For example, if the tag construction is applied to a block, this is visible to all users. Wiki-tags are owned by the community, and there is a single set of tags for any ob-ject; thus wiki-tags have broad scope . For example, the tag construction can be applied at most once to a given block. Figure 1: Tag application interface. The tag con-struction has already been applied to this block. The user is entering a new tag (so far  X  X ik X ), and auto-complete shows existing tags that begin with the text entered so far.

We could have implemented tags as a separate add-on to the wiki or by extending the wiki model (e.g., by remem-bering the user who applied a tag to an object, and making that tag application only editable by that user). However, we prefer to follow the wiki model whenever possible. More-over, we wanted to promote the use of tags that were useful to the community. Therefore, implementing tags as wiki objects was a good fit for our goals.
Tags are applied to points or blocks using a rather stan-dard interface (see Figure 1). Users type into a text field, and an auto-complete function suggests tags that have been applied to this type of object. This encourages users to reus e tags.

In addition to enhancing user exploration, tags are used in two system functions. (a) Point tags can be used to filter the display of points on the map. For example, a user could request to see only points that had one of the tags air pump or bike rack . Filtering is rather straightforward, and we do not discuss it further in this paper. (b) Block tags can be used to tailor route-finding preferences.

Route-finding preferences . Before we introduced tags, our route-finding algorithm estimated the bikeability of a block by considering user ratings if available, and by us-ing objective features (such as block type, speed limit, and shoulder width) otherwise. We believed that tags would be an effective complement to ratings. A user can have only one rating for a given block  X  one of five choices from  X  X m-passable X  to  X  X xcellent X   X  but this does not capture why a user likes or dislikes a block. Hence, we modified the route-finding interface to let users express preferences fo r or against certain tags (see Figure 2). Users may assign selected tags a bonus or a penalty or state that they be avoided altogether. (User tag preferences are saved betwee n Figure 2: Route finder and tag preferences interface. In this example: (a) blocks with the bikelane tag are favored, (b) blocks with unpaved are penalized, (c) blocks with prohibited are avoided completely, and (d) all other tags (in particular, bike path and closed ) have no effect. route requests.) This innovative use of tags gives users mor e expressivity and control. For example, a user might assign a penalty to the hill tag in most requests, but assign this tag a bonus when in the mood for a challenging workout. The route finding algorithm respects any specified tag pref-erences. If a block has any tag that the user wants to avoid, that block will not be added to the route. If a block has a tag that has been assigned a bonus (or penalty), the block X  X  bikeability estimate will be incremented (or decremented) .
Tags have both similarities and differences with the two other Cyclopath annotation techniques, notes and ratings. Like notes, tags can be applied to blocks or points, are pub-lic, and aid users in evaluating points, blocks, and routes. However, like ratings, tags are used by the route finding algorithm. Table 1 summarizes the three annotation tech-niques.
Tagging was added to Cyclopath in April 2009. In the subsequent year, 178 users have applied tags, creating a vo-cabulary of 239 distinct tags that have been applied over 1,900 times to over 1,400 distinct blocks and points. (There would be more tag applications if tags had narrow (multiple tag applications per user for each object) rather than broad (a single set of tag applications for each object) scope [12] ). Over one quarter of all revisions include tag edits. Over 600 users have filtered with tags and over 2,000 users have ex-

 pressed route finding preferences with tags. As common in open content systems, many more users consume informa-tion (here, using tags for filtering and route finding) than produce information (here, applying tags).

The tagging vocabulary contains a number of tags that were applied automatically. Prior to the introduction of tagging, blocks could have any of three binary features: un-paved , bike lane , and closed . We automatically converted these features into tags, thus creating a small initial tag v o-cabulary consisting of 2,470 applications of these three ta gs. Later in 2009 we wrote code to automatically apply two ad-ditional tags. prohibited was applied to about 1,700 blocks (mainly expressways) where it is illegal to ride a bicycle. hill was applied to almost 15,000 blocks with a slope greater than 2%, based on existing measures of hilliness and existin g applications of the tag in the system. We also set default route finding preferences to avoid both the closed and pro-hibited tags. We refer to this set of five tags as auto-applied tags.

In our analysis of tag applications, we ignore all auto-applied tags and any tags created by members of the Cy-clopath research team. In our analysis of tag preferences, w e ignore preferences for closed and prohibited , because these tags have default preferences in the route finding dialog. Table 2 summarizes the tagging data that we analyzed. In the next three sections, we sketch our methods (a combi-nation of manual coding and quantitative analysis), presen t our findings, and discuss their implications.
In this section, we analyze the tagging vocabulary that has evolved in Cyclopath and identify factors that influ-enced its development. A tagging vocabulary is the set of distinct tags used in an online community. For example, if the tag low traffic has been applied twice, rocky five times, and gravel once, then the vocabulary would be the set { low traffic , rocky , gravel } .

As mentioned earlier, blocks and points are intrinsically different and play different roles in Cyclopath: blocks are the components of routes, and points are landmarks and the start and end points for routes. Further, block tags and point tags serve different purposes: block tags can fine-tune route preferences, while point tags filter the map. Thus, we provisionally treat block tags and point tags as two separat e vocabularies and do several analyses to see if this separati on is warranted.
The first characteristic that we examine for the two tag-ging vocabularies is diversity, the ratio of the number of distinct tags to the number of tag applications. High diver-sity means that each distinct tag has been applied just a few times; low diversity means that each distinct tag has been applied many times. Cyclopath point tags have a diversity of 0.18, and block tags have a diversity of 0.09. Therefore, the mean point tag has been applied about 5 times, and the mean block tag about 10 times. However, the mean number of applications is a misleading statistic: both vocabulari es follow the expected non-normal  X  X ong tail X  distribution. I n-deed, the reason the point tag vocabulary is more diverse is because it has a longer  X  X ail X , i.e., tags that have been applied just once.

Contributing to the lower diversity of block tags are the inherent nature of blocks and a specific feature of the Cy-clopath user interface. Contiguous sequences of blocks oft en share a feature  X  for example, several blocks in a row may be bumpy or scenic. Users can select a set of blocks, then apply the same tag to the entire set with a single UI action. On the other hand, points must be evaluated separately, and point tags applied one by one.

A difference in diversity tells us about the global struc-ture of the two tagging vocabularies. However, it does not tell us about similarities or differences in their content. W e examine this issue next.
A natural way to compare the two tag vocabularies is sim-ply to compute the overlap (intersection). As background, we note that the auto-complete feature (see Figure 1) could bias user tag application decisions. To avoid biasing users in favor of developing separate tag vocabularies for points an d blocks, we initially designed auto-complete to suggest tag s applied to both blocks and points. However, after about six months of use, only 7 out of 109 tags occurred in both vocabularies. To better support emergent practice, we then modified auto-complete to suggest only tags from the rele-vant vocabulary for each object. The total overlap is now 10 tags out of 239 distinct tags.

For those tags that appear in both vocabularies, the ma-jority of their applications are in just one. For example, the tag steep hill has been applied to 20 blocks, but just one point. The tag food has been applied to 67 points, but to just two blocks (which perhaps have many restaurants alongside them).

Since blocks and points are different types of objects, it is not surprising that different terms are used to describe them. However, perhaps a more abstract categorization of the two vocabularies would reveal deeper similarities  X  or clarify their differences. We did a content categorization t o investigate these possibilities.
We did three categorizations of the tagging vocabularies:
For each content categorization, three coders were given classification rules and categorized the tags independentl y. Tags that did not fit into any of the categories were classi-fied as other . After independent classification, the tags were assigned their final categories using majority rule.
Building on the definitions by Sen et al., we define factual, subjective, and personal tags as follows: 1. Factual tags express objective properties of an item. 2. Subjective tags express opinions. This class can be 3. Personal tags have the user who applied them as the The results of this categorization are shown in Table 3(a). All three coders agreed 78% of the time for blocks and 90% of the time for points, while at least two of the coders agreed 97% of the time for blocks and 98% of the time for points. In comparison, the distribution of tags in MovieLens was 63% factual, 29% subjective, 3% personal, and 5%  X  X ther X  [12].
There were few personal tags in either vocabulary; indeed, most personal tags that were applied were removed by other users. One such example is the tag work1 , for which 74 applications to blocks were removed.

We expected that community ownership of tags would lead to a very high proportion of factual tags. And factual tags indeed are the majority in both vocabularies. However, while over 90% of point tags are factual, the distribution of the vocabulary for block tags is more comparable to that of MovieLens (where tag applications are owned by users, not the community), and there is a sizeable minority of subjec-tive block tags. We can think of two possible explanations for this. First, perhaps Cyclopath users in general simply agree that a particular block is bumpy or dangerous , even though it is theoretically possible to disagree. Second, th is may indicate an intrinsic problem with the Subjective cate-gory or at least our application of it. Maybe  X  X ubjective X  is subjective  X  or maybe we were too strict in our application. Why do we see a different distribution for point tags? To answer this question, we refer back to Sen et al. They identified five user tasks supported by tags in MovieLens: self-expression, organizing, learning, finding, and decis ion support. Surveys showed that different classes of tags were more useful for different tasks. Factual tags were particu-larly useful for learning and finding, while subjective tags were useful for self-expression and decision support. The learning and decision support tasks are most important in Cyclopath: learning is supported by map exploration, and decision support occurs during route finding and evaluation . Point tags are not used during route finding. Therefore, they are mainly used for learning, which explains the high per-centage of factual tags. On the other hand, block tags must support both learning and decision support, which may ac-count for the higher proportion of subjective tags.
We also distinguished tags by whether they are bike-specific : 1. Bike-specific tags are directly related to the practice 2. Not bike-specific tags are everything else. These
Table 3(b) shows the results for this categorization. All three coders agreed 40% of the time for blocks and 90% of the time for points, while at least two coders agreed 93% of the time for blocks and 98% of the time for points.
As with notes [10], a much higher proportion of block tags are bike-specific. This is because when planning and eval-uating routes, cyclists are concerned with properties of th e route (or the blocks that comprise it) that affect bikeabil-ity. On the other hand, points are of more general interest as possible destinations, landmarks, or resources along th e way; therefore, cyclists likely are more interested in intr insic information about the places themselves, e.g., is it a good place to get food or an interesting place to visit?
We used the following rules to categorize by part of speech: 1.  X  X s-a X  noun tags fit the pattern  X  X his block/point 2.  X  X as-a X  noun tags fit the pattern  X  X his block/point 3. Adjective tags describe a property of a block or point. 4. Verb tags describe actions relevant to a point or block, The results for this categorization are shown in Table 3(c). All three coders agreed 56% of the time for blocks and 62% of the time for points, while at least two of the coders agreed 92% of the time for blocks and 97% of the time for points.
Once again, the categorization yields quite different re-sults for both vocabularies. The most striking difference is in the use of adjectives. About a third of all block tags are adjectives, while only 5% of tags applied to points are ad-jectives. These adjective block tags give information abou t what it X  X  like to ride there. On the other hand, point tags often describe what a place is or what can be found there, uses well-supported by nouns.
Cyclopath is unusual in that two separate tagging vocabu-laries with very different characteristics have emerged. Th e block tag and point tag vocabularies differ not only in their specific terms, but also in the type of content and distri-bution. Three content categorizations revealed unique, ye t mutually supporting points of comparison. Point tags tend to be factual nouns and not bike-specific, while block tags are a mix of factual and subjective nouns and adjectives and are mostly bike-specific. We trace these distinctions to in-trinsic differences between points and blocks, the different roles they play in Cyclopath, the different roles played by block and point tags, and user interface differences.
Tags, notes, and ratings comprise an ecosystem of an-notation techniques in Cyclopath. Table 1 (in Section 3 above) summarizes the important properties of each tech-nique. Here we investigate similarities and differences in the usage patterns of tags vs. notes and tag preferences vs. ratings.
Tags and notes have obvious similarities. Both describe blocks and points, and both are public, owned by the Cy-clopath community. As is typical, Cyclopath tags are mostly single words, with a few short phrases. On the other hand, notes can be arbitrarily long texts. For example, here is a Cyclopath block note: Buses go very fast along here, but they generally give you plenty of space. No stop signs! , and here is a point note: They fix and give away commuter bikes, on volunteer time and donations. Good source of used parts. We examined two relationships between tags and notes: con-tent overlap and usage substitution.

Content overlap . We examined cases where both tags and notes had been applied to a single block. For example, the tag dangerous had been applied to a certain block, and that block also had the following note: Thus, the tag dangerous appeared literally in the note.
Our overlap analysis was simple: for each block b with whether t i appears in any of the notes n 1 , ..., n M , and the same for points. 31% of block tag applications and 26% of point tag applications were mentioned in a corresponding note.

Usage substitution . Given the similarity of tags and notes, we wondered how the introduction of tags 9 months after Cyclopath went live affected note usage. We thus cal-culated the mean number of note edits per revision before and after tags were introduced. There was a significant dif-ference in the mean number of note edits per revision be-fore and after tags were introduced: 0.87 vs. 0.66 (t-test; p &lt; 0.01). This suggests that tags assumed some of the func-tions notes had served.
As we explained earlier, both ratings and tags play a role in the Cyclopath route finder, creating a context for com-paring the two. We show how the tag preferences users express when requesting routes can be used to derive user preferences for blocks, then investigate whether these tag -based block preferences correlate with the preferences use rs express through ratings.
Ratings let users express specific bikeability preferences for specific blocks: I think this block of Summit Avenue is  X  X xcellent X  or I think this block of Hennepin Avenue is X  X oor X  . Tags let users express generic preferences for the types of blocks they want in a route: I prefer blocks with the tag X  X ike-lane X  (a bikeability  X  X onus X ) and dislike blocks with the ta g Figure 3: The relationship between ratings (directly expressed preferences) and tag-derived preferences.  X  X umpy X  (a  X  X enalty X ) X  . Consider the following situation, as illustrated in figure 3: a user u has rated a block b as  X  X xcel-lent X ; the tag bikelane has been applied to b (not necessarily by u ); u has expressed a  X  X onus X  route-finding preference for the tag bikelane . u  X  X  (directly expressed) ratings-based preference for b and u  X  X  (derived) tag-based preference for b appear consistent. This makes sense: if a user likes blocks with bikelane s, shouldn X  X  the user rate block b highly?
Our goal is to test this intuition formally. We first intro-duce some terminology: a user has a tag-derived preference for a block b if there exists at least one tag t such that (a) t has been applied to b , and (b) the user has expressed a route-finding preference using t . We then compute the global correlation between ratings and tag-derived prefer -ences by aggregating across all users, blocks, and tags. We next show how to compute tag-derived preferences .
The intuition for computing tag-derived preferences is sim -ple. Suppose the tags t i , and t j have been applied to a block b . If a user u expressed a  X  X onus X  preference for t i , this should lead to a positive tag-derived preference for b , and if the user expressed a  X  X enalty X  or  X  X void X  preference for t this should lead to a negative tag-derived preference for b . And if the user expressed opposing preferences for t i and t i.e.,  X  X onus X  for one and  X  X enalty X  or  X  X void X  for the other, this should lead to a more-or-less neutral tag-derived pref er-ence for b . To formalize these intuitions, we must make two decisions: (a) how to translate tag preferences to numeric for a tag. We consider each of these in turn.

Translating tag preferences to numeric values . We must specify precisely how to go from bonus , penalty , and avoid to numeric values. It is easy to specify constraints on possible values. (a) Values should range from -1 to 1. (b) A mathematical relationship that must hold among the three preferences is:  X  1  X  avoid &lt; penalty &lt; 0 &lt; bonus  X  1. (c) Since the  X  X void X  preference is as negative as possible, it makes sense to set its value to  X  1. (d)  X  X enalty X  and  X  X onus X  are opposites (conceptually and in the Cyclopath route finder), so it makes sense for  X  X enalty X  to be equal to  X   X  bonus. However, there are no obviously correct val-ues for  X  X enalty X  and  X  X onus X . Therefore, we experimented with a number of different values, including 0 . 75, 0 . 5, and passable X ) to 4 ( X  X xcellent X ).
 Figure 4: Example use of tag preferences in route requests used for illustrating three ways to count tag preferences. 0 . 1. When we computed correlations between tag-derived preferences and ratings using the different values, the re-sults were virtually identical unless we gave  X  X enalty X  and  X  X onus X  scores close to 0. When we present the correlations below, we present them using two sets of values for ( X  X void X ,  X  X enalty X ,  X  X onus X ): (-1, -0.75, 0.75) and (-1, -0.1, 0.1).
Tag preferences: what to count . What it means for a user to have a preference for a tag turns out to be a bit com-plicated, since users may change their preferences with eac h route request (recall that preferences are saved between re -quests). Figure 4 illustrates this situation. A user has iss ued a total of 12 route requests, expressing a  X  X onus X  preferenc e for the tag t on the first request, changing this to a X  X enalty X  on the second request, then returning to a  X  X onus X  on the eleventh request. t could be a tag like hill , and this pat-tern could reflect alternation between a weekend preference ( bonus hills for a better workout ) and a weekday preference ( avoid hills for a less sweaty commute ). There are three plausible things we could count to compute tag preferences: 1. End-state. Define a user X  X  preference for a tag as 2. Decision-average. Define a user X  X  preference for a 3. Use-average. Define a user X  X  preference for a tag by (-1,-0.75,0.75) 0.259 0.278 0.283 (-1,-0.1,0.1) 0.149 0.211 0.225 Table 4: Correlation between tag-derived prefer-ences and ratings. Two different numeric transla-tions of the tag preferences (avoid, penalty, bonus) are used.
The results of the correlation between tag-derived prefer-ences and ratings are given in Table 4. The correlation is positive, but weak to moderate (results were similar for all numeric translations of tag preferences we used). However, the average correlation obscures individual cases where th e correlation is particularly good or bad. Considering such cases is instructive in understanding the relationship be-tween tag-derived preferences and ratings.
 Good correlation . There is a block of the Minnehaha Creek Trail that includes the tags stairs and pedestrian bridge . One user gave the tags stairs and pedestrian bridge penal-ties and also rated the block as poor . Another user also gave stairs a penalty and rated the block as poor . In an-other case, a block along the Kenilworth Trail with the tags bikelane and bike path was rated as excellent by six users who also gave these two tags a bonus. It is probable that the qualities represented by the tags in these two examples influenced the user X  X  preferences for the blocks.
Poor correlation . There is a block of Dale St. that has the bikelane tag. From the pool of users who rated that block, only bonus was assigned to bikelane . But most users rated the block as poor or fair , while nobody rated it as excellent , resulting in a strong negative correlation between the tag-derived preferences and the ratings. A possible rea -son for this can be inferred by looking at a note attached to this block: Surface of road is very bumpy and full of pot holes. Watch where your tires go! . If the tags bumpy or pot holes had been added to this block, the tag preferences might have reflected the user ratings much better! There-fore, this correlation failure seems to be caused by missing data. A second reason for poor or negative correlation may be implicit priorities among tags: for example, a user might normally avoid unpaved bike paths, but will make an excep-tion if they are scenic . Finally, some tags like construction reflect time-limited properties of a block, but we do not see evidence of users changing their ratings to reflect such tem-porary changes in the bikeability of a block.
We showed that tags and notes have significant overlap in content. Rather than seeing this as wasteful redundancy, we view it as confirmation that tags and notes have dis-tinct utility: tags provide quick descriptions of objects a nd let users fine tune the route finder; notes provide detailed information useful for learning and evaluation. In additio n, there was a positive correlation between user preferences e x-pressed directly as ratings and derived from the use of tags in route requests. We further identified situations where th e correlations were particularly positive or negative. We su g-gest follow-up research on both sets of results in Section 8. 1.
Table 5: Specialization in annotation behavior.
The findings for the previous research question illuminate the overall relationship among the use of tags, notes, and ratings. However, we also investigate similar issues from the perspective of users. Specifically, we examine how users balance their tagging role (producer vs. consumer), public annotation technique (tags vs. notes), and annotation obje ct (blocks vs. points): are they specialists or generalists?
Most users of open content systems only consume infor-mation, and only a small minority actually contribute it. We examined whether this was true for Cyclopath tagging. Specifically, we looked at tagging actions concerning block s  X  either applying tags or using tags to express route finding 5 tagging-relevant actions with blocks  X  any combination of applying tags and using tags to specify route finding prefer-ences. We categorized users as specialists if at least 75% of their tagging-relevant actions was either production or co n-sumption. Table 5(a) presents the results. As expected, the vast majority of users (89%) were information consumers. However, we were interested to see that the majority (55% or 26 of 47) of the remaining users were production special-ists; they produced value while taking little value in retur n. This finding is related to work on social roles in online dis-cussion forums that identifies  X  X nswer people X , users who primarily answer rather than ask questions [19]. However, prior research did not have access to private user behavior such as message reading; thus, it is possible that  X  X nswer people X  received value from reading answers even if they didn X  X  pose many questions of their own. Because we have access to the entire Cyclopath usage history, we can analyze behavior like message reading or preference setting that is typically unavailable to researchers [8]. cause we did not log point filtering behavior.
Tags and notes are both publicly visible, shared annota-tions. The previous section showed that both techniques are used, and that the introduction of tagging decreased the use of notes. But do individual users combine both techniques? Or do they specialize?
We compared tag applications and note edits made af-ter tags were added to Cyclopath. We considered the set of users who had made at least five public annotations (tag ap-plications or note edits) and defined users as specialists if at least 75% of their annotations were either tags or notes. The results are shown in Table 5(b). We make several observa-tions. First, a majority  X  68%  X  of users specialized in one technique, with note specialists outnumbering tag special -ists 52 to 39. Second, a healthy proportion of users edited both notes and tags. We think that this may be because both types of edits are easy to make, and they serve com-plementary purposes, as we sketched in Table 1 in Section 3. Finally, we did followup analysis to investigate how the in-troduction of tags into Cyclopath affected users who had edited at least 5 notes prior to this time. We saw an utterly mixed picture. The vast majority of such users (99 out of 122) had become inactive by the time tags were introduced. Of the other 23 users, 8 remained note specialists, 8 became tag specialists, and 7 became generalists. Additional work is required to understand what drove individual decisions t o retain an existing practice or adopt a new one.
Finally, we wondered whether users preferred to annotate one type of object, either blocks or points. As in the previ-ous analysis, we considered users who had a total of at least 5 tag edits or note applications. We defined users as special-ists if at least 75% of their annotation were associated with either points or blocks. We did this analysis three ways: with tags alone (i.e., only for users who applied at least 5 tags), with notes alone (only for users who edited at least 5 notes), and with tags and notes in combination (counting users whose total of note edits + tag applications was at least 5). Table 5(c) presents the results and lets us make several observations. First, all three analyses reveal tha t a high proportion of users are specialists. Second, there was a noticeable difference in the relative proportion of point an d block specialists when we only considered notes and when we only considered tags. For notes, 92% of specialists (170 out of 184) specialized in blocks. For tags, the ratio is much more even: 61% of specialists (36 of 59) specialized in block s.
We found strong specialization in usage of the public an-notation techniques tags and notes. (a) Most users consume annotations; only a small minority produce them. This re-sult is consistent with and extends prior research on open content systems. (b) Most users who do annotate favor one technique, with notes more popular. (c) Users also special-ize in their choice of objects to annotate, and most of those who specialize are block specialists. We speculate that thi s is because blocks play a central role in Cyclopath (they are the building blocks for routes), and there are many more blocks than points (over 150,000 vs. about 2,400). This work raises several interesting followup possibiliti es.
First, there are more opportunities to analyze the ecosys-tem of Cyclopath annotation techniques, notably deeper ex-ploration of users X  route preferences and how they express them. User changes to their tag preferences and ratings form an intriguing context for studying these questions. We hypothesize several different types of preference changes: 1. A more-or-less permanent change in preference: for 2. A temporary change in preference: for example, a 3. A change in external conditions : for example, a 4. Experimentation : for example, a user might request We conjecture that certain usage patterns indicate differ-ent types of preference changes. Do users request a route, change a preference, then immediately re-request the same route? If so, this may indicate experimentation. (We al-ready have found that 48% of all tag preference changes occur during route re-requests.) Does a user maintain a preference for a long time, then change it and keep the new one for a long time? If so, this may indicate a true change in preference. Does a user have a preference, change it for a route request, then change it back for the next request (of a different route)? This may indicate a temporary change in preference. Appropriate methods to investigate these issu es include both quantitative analysis of logged usage data (as we did in this paper) and user interviews.

Second, our findings suggest a number of semi-automated methods to infer new annotations. 1. Notes to tags. An obvious way to infer new tags is 2. Tag preferences to ratings. Certain tags like bike 3. Geoinference. The geographic nature of Cyclopath
All these methods are fallible. Thus, we also will experi-ment with mixed-initiative dialog models for users to mon-itor and approve/reject inferred tags. At least two possi-ble models are attractive. Basic wiki model : Inferred tags are applied automatically. Users monitor for changes using normal wiki techniques (watch regions, recent changes) and then revert inappropriate tags. Work Hints Model [9]: In-ferred tags are maintained as potential tag applications an d presented to users through a visual interface. Inferred tag s are applied only if a user approves.
We introduced tags into the Cyclopath geographic wiki for bicyclists. We chose the relatively rare design option o f making tags owned by the community (broad scope) rather than individual users (narrow scope). We made this choice because it is consistent with the wiki model and to promote the goal of evolving a tag vocabulary that would be useful to the entire community. We also modified the Cyclopath route finder to let users use tags to fine tune their routing preferences. We studied the first year of tagging behavior in Cyclopath, finding that: (a) two quite distinct vocabular -ies emerged, one around geographic points and one around blocks in the transportation network; (b) while tags have evolved a distinct usage pattern, their use has some over-lap with the use of other annotation techniques, and this raises interesting design opportunities; (c) user annotat ion behavior is highly specialized.
