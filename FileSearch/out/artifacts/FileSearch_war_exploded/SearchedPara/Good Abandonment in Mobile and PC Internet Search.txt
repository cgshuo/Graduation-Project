 Query abandonment by search engine users is generally con-sidered to be a negative signal. In this paper, we explore the concept of good abandonment . We define a good abandon-ment as an abandoned query for which the user X  X  informa-tion need was successfully addressed by the search results page, with no need to click on a result or refine the query. We present an analysis of abandoned internet search queries across two modalities (PC and mobile) in three locales. The goal is to approximate the prevalence of good abandonment, and to identify types of information needs that may lead to good abandonment, across different locales and modali-ties. Our study has three key findings: First, queries poten-tially indicating good abandonment make up a significant portion of all abandoned queries. Second, the good aban-donment rate from mobile search is significantly higher than that from PC search, across all locales tested. Third, classi-fied by type of information need, the major classes of good abandonment vary dramatically by both locale and modal-ity. Our findings imply that it is a mistake to uniformly consider query abandonment as a negative signal. Further, there is a potential opportunity for search engines to drive additional good abandonment, especially for mobile search users, by improving search features and result snippets. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Measurement, Human Factors good abandonment, mobile internet search, PC internet search, query analysis
The information retrieval community has a long tradition of using user clicks on search results as a positive signal. Clicks (and sometimes a lack of clicks as well) have been used successfully to learn ranking functions [14, 13, 3, 18] and to evaluate comparative algorithms in A-B [9, 5] or interleaved experiments [8, 10]. It has been considered to be an indicator of user dissatisfaction if users choose not to click on any results, or worse,  X  X bandon X  their query by neither clicking a result nor issuing a query refinement [10].

Internet search engines have added features over the past several years that attempt to answer users X  information needs directly on the search results page, without requiring a click on any of the results. Leading engines now provide a large array of these features for basic information needs such as weather, stock quotes, local business addresses and phone numbers, images, current news headlines, flight information, package delivery tracking, and many others [1, 2]. In addi-tion, the result snippets returned by search engines have im-proved over time [19, 17] and may often answer information needs directly [7].

In this paper, we explore the concept of good abandon-ment . We define a good abandonment as an abandoned query for which the user X  X  information need was successfully addressed by the search results page, with no need to click on a result or refine the query.
 We present an analysis of abandoned queries sampled from Google X  X  search logs. Specifically, we analyze abandoned queries from three countries (the United States, Japan and China) across two modalities (PC search and mobile search) for a total of six query streams.

We are particularly interested in mobile search and how it compares to PC (desktop/laptop) search with respect to abandonment. We anticipate that there may be differ-ences for several reasons. First, on mobile devices X  X ven current top-tier devices such as the Apple iPhone X  X pening web pages is often slow and clunky, with formatting issues, usability issues, and content omissions. Therefore we pos-tulate that users might want to avoid opening pages, and instead formulate queries in a way that may return answers directly within search results. Second, anecdotally we hear from users about a  X  X uick answer in a bar X  type of use case for mobile search. Here, users are out with friends (and away from their PC), and use mobile search to answer questions that come up in conversation X  X hat X  X  the weather going to be like tomorrow, what time does the movie start tonight, what year was this celebrity born, etc. [16, 12]. This use case, if real, would potentially drive good abandonment on mobile search. Third, mobile devices are inherently local, and to the extent that internet search engines provide local business addresses and phone numbers, we might anticipate a high rate of good abandonment for queries seeking these types of information.

Our study has three key findings. First, we find that queries potentially indicating good abandonment make up a significant portion of all abandoned queries, ranging from 19% to 55% across the set of locales and modalities we an-alyzed. Second, we find that the good abandonment rate from mobile search is significantly higher than that from PC search, again across all three locales. This appears to be a meaningful, robust difference between how users inter-act with mobile search versus search on a PC. Third, by hand-classifying abandoned queries by the type of informa-tion need they represent, we identify the major classes of good abandonment, differences across locales and modali-ties, and perhaps most importantly, largest opportunities for internet search engines to drive additional good aban-donment for their users.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes some related work. Section 3 describes the methodology we used to sample and classify abandoned queries, and de-fines the categories and codings used. Section 4 presents abandoned query analysis results. Section 5 discusses the implications of our findings for internet search engines, and concludes with some pointers to future research.
Clicks have been treated as the primary implicit user feed-back for search engines to learn ranking functions [14, 13, 3, 18] and to evaluate the performance of search algorithms [5, 10]. However, as Joachims, et al. [10] pointed out, more informative than what users clicked on is what they didn X  X  click on. Considering user feedback beyond clicks,  X  X ban-donment, X  describing the user X  X  decision to not to click on any of the results, is of particular interest.

In general, query abandonment has been considered a neg-ative signal, with efforts targeted specifically to reduce it (e.g., [15]). A key contribution of this paper is to introduce the concept of good abandonment. There have been previ-ous studies that imply the existence of good abandonment. For example, Cutrell, et al. [7] conducted an eye-tracking study where web search tasks were broadly divided into two types: navigational tasks and informational tasks, for which results with different snippet lengths were shown to partic-ipants. The study suggests that the total time spent on a task was improved for informational tasks when increas-ing the length of the query-dependent contextual snippet in search results. One implication from this study is that some information needs may have been achieved by viewing snippets without clicking though the results, and therefore leading to good abandonment as defined above.

In this paper, we particularly study the good abandon-ment across different modalities (PC and mobile) in three locales with significant mobile search usage: the United States, Japan and China. As mobile search is becoming an increasingly important way for internet users to gain ac-cess to online information, several efforts have been devoted to analyze the search patterns on mobile devices and com-pare them to the traditional computer-based search in order to reveal the unique search patterns and ultimately, derive insights for search engines to better serve these users. For instance, Kamvar, et al. [11] conducted one of the first large scale analysis of English queries from two separate Google mobile logs (Google XHTML and PDA interfaces) and found that users with less sophisticated input capabilities submit shorter queries. This study also highlighted the high per-centage of adult-related searches seen in wireless search. Baeza-Yates, et al. [4] conducted a comparison of Yahoo! mobile and computer-based search in Japan, and reported similar query characteristics regarding the query length. A language model based query topic classification in this study suggested the most common query topics in Japanese mo-bile search were online shopping, sports, and health (in that order), while art, sports, and online shopping were the most common ones for PC search. Another large scale study based on data generated by more than 600,000 European mobile internet users towards the end of 2005 highlighted some im-portant trends in mobile search, such as the shorter average query length, rare use of advanced search features, more lim-ited search vocabulary and higher incidence of repeat queries [6]. A recent logs-based comparison of search patterns across modalities examined the distribution and variability of tasks that users perform, and suggested that search usage is much more focused for the average mobile user than for the aver-age computer-based user [12]. These studies were all large scale analyses based on random query streams, but none focused on abandoned queries.
For the purposes of this study, we define an abandoned query as a query that is not followed by any click or any further query within a 24-hour period. We randomly sam-pled abandoned queries from Google X  X  PC and mobile search logs from a week in September -October, 2008. Following Google X  X  privacy policies, queries containing personal iden-tifying information were excluded from all samples. We also removed mal-formed queries which are nonsense or have en-coding errors. We sampled 400 abandoned mobile and 400 abandoned PC queries from Japan (Japanese) and US (En-glish), and 1000 abandoned mobile and 1000 abandoned PC queries from China (Simplified Chinese).

Because our queries are sampled from logs, we don X  X  have access to the user X  X  true information need, or any indication of whether their need was actually met (that is, whether their abandonment was  X  X ood X ). We therefore have to fall back on our own judgment of potential information needs for each query. We classify a query as a potential good abandon-ment if there is a dominant information need associated with the query that we felt could theoretically be achieved by an internet search engine results page. We made the judgment of potential good abandonment for each query by consider-ing the query itself, rather than looking at Google X  X  result page for it. We chose this way in order to obtain an up-per bound on good abandonment X  X ounting all queries that could potentially lead to good abandonment if the search re-sults page was ideal, rather than limited by what the search results page looks like today. In other words, this classi-fication attempts to provide an upper bound estimate on good abandonment that internet search engines could gen-erate. In cases where the information need expressed by the query was more ambiguous, but at least one strong interpre-tation could lead to good abandonment, we simply classify as  X  X aybe X  a potential good abandonment. Please see ex-amples in Table 1. Figure 1: Percentages of queries classified as  X  X es X ,  X  X aybe X ,  X  X o X  with respect to the potential good abandonment definition in six abandoned query sam-ples.

We further classify each potential good abandonment query as a likely good abandonment by examining the actual re-sults provided by Google. If we felt the information need expressed by the query was clearly met on the results page, we classified it as a likely good abandonment. That is, likely good abandonment identifies the subset of potentially good abandonments that were likely to have been actual good abandonments, based on the search results page the user saw. For example, for the query [1 USD in GBP], the re-sults page contained the exchange rates both in a calculator box and in results snippets directly. If we felt the results page may meet the information need but were less sure, we classified the query as  X  X aybe X  a likely good abandonment. For example, for [baby come back], partial lyrics were in-cluded in result snippets, which may (or may not) satisfy the user X  X  information need. Table 1 gives more examples.
Finally, the authors coded each potential or likely good abandonment query by category of information need. Rather than pre-defining these categories, each researcher generated their own by doing a first pass through the query samples from their locale. We compared category lists and found that, with slight naming differences, we had converged on a common list. These categories and their definitions are listed in Table 2. Most interestingly, the prevalence and likelihood of good abandonment across the different cate-gories varied significantly both by locale and by modality, as we will describe in detail later in Section 4.3.
In this section, we report the upper bound estimate of the good abandonment rate by classifying an abandoned query as  X  X es X ,  X  X aybe X  or  X  X o X  with respect to our potential good abandonment definition. As shown in Figure 1,  X  X es X  or  X  X aybe X  X otential good abandonments make up a significant portion of all abandoned queries in both mobile and PC searches and in all the three locales we studied.
According to the definition and methodology for identify-ing a potential good abandonment as described in Section 3, we may estimate the upper bound of the good abandonment rate as the potential good abandonment rate which refers to the proportion of abandoned queries classified as  X  X es X  or  X  X aybe X  a potential good abandonment out of all the abandoned queries. For mobile search, abandoned queries whose dominant information need or one strong interpre-tation could theoretically be answered by a search engine results page count an enormous 54.8% of abandoned queries in the US, 49.8% in China, and 32.3% in Japan. For searches from PC X  X , such queries make up 31.8% of abandoned queries in US, 23.3% in China and 19.0% in Japan.

We were surprised by the sheer magnitude of these po-tential good abandonment rates. Obviously, there are many judgment calls involved in this analysis, and we purposely classified queries with the goal of estimating an upper bound. Even with those caveats, the numbers indicate that good abandonment makes up a very significant portion of aban-doned queries.

Comparing query streams, Japanese mobile search presents a significantly lower potential good abandonment rate com-pared to the other two mobile search locales. Japan is con-sidered to be a more mature market with respect to mobile search [20], perhaps implying larger diversity in search top-ics and more depth of user X  X  information needs in this lo-cale. This may be one explanation why we found less good abandonments from the Japanese mobile abandoned queries sample.

As we can also notice from the above statistics, the poten-tial good abandonment rate is significantly higher in mobile search compared to the counterpart in PC search for all the three countries, with a p-value &lt; 1e-5 for the large-sample z-test conducted. We theorize that the higher potential good abandonment rate in mobile search may be due to the unique search experience on mobile devices. In particular, 1) Because retrieving web pages over mobile devices is often a clumsy experience, mobile searchers may want to avoid opening pages by querying topics which can be answered di-rectly within search results. We observed a higher rate of simple use cases such as seeking a weather report, a listing of local address and/or phone number, a stock quote, etc., where users can generally expect that the information they seek will be presented directly on the search results page [1, 2]. 2) Mobile information needs are often promoted by con-textual factors, which consist of activity at the time, current location and related artifacts, and conversations with others [16]. Many mobile information needs appear to be  X  X uick answer X  types of searches, which potentially lead to good abandonment.
Next, we re-examined each of the queries that were iden-tified as potential good abandonments. We examined the actual results page returned by Google, with the goal of de-termining whether query X  X  information need is currently met on the search results page. This gives us a measure of likely good abandonment rate  X  X hat is, how often the search engine is providing results that likely result in good abandonment for users, as a subset of the queries that potentially could lead to good abandonment. Again, we classified as  X  X es X  if we felt a query X  X  information need was clearly met on the re-Figure 2: Percentage of potential good abandon-ment queries which are classified as Yes/Maybe/No with respect to the likely good abandonment defini-tion sults page,  X  X aybe X  if we were less sure or there was partial information, and  X  X o X  otherwise.

Figure 2 shows the results. The full bars represent the percentage of abandoned queries that are potential good abandonments in each query stream . The bars are divided into Yes/Maybe/No categories of likely good abandonment. That is, the lightest grey bars indicate the portion of aban-doned queries that we felt were likely to be actual good abandonments; the darker grey bars may have been, but we were less sure based on the information shown on the re-sults page. The black bars are perhaps the most interesting. They indicate clear headroom X  X ueries that have the poten-tial to be good abandonments, but whose information needs are not addressed on the search results page today.
Looking at this graph, we can see again that the rate of potential good abandonment is significantly higher for the mobile query streams than the PC query streams, in all three locales. However, the headroom for driving additional good abandonments (the black bars) is much closer across PC and mobile, hovering between 8% to 15% of abandoned queries for all six query streams .

In other words, the search engine is successfully  X  X nswer-ing X  a greater proportion of the mobile queries that are po-tentially answerable on the results page. For PC search, an average of 56% of potential good abandonments were clearly or possibly met on the results page. For mobile search, that number is 70%.

This doesn X  X  imply that mobile search results have higher quality. Rather, it may be attributed to mobile searchers having more focused, less complex information needs than PC searchers. Other studies on random mobile query streams indicate this (e.g., [12, 6]), and we noticed similar patterns in the abandoned query streams we analyzed. For example, we observed that 18% of potential good abandonments in Chinese mobile search were weather queries (a simple infor-mation need), while on Chinese PC search the rate was un-der 1%. Similarly, 43% of US mobile search potential good abandonments appeared to seek local addresses or phone numbers, compared with under 28% of potential good aban-donments from US PC search.

Comparing locales, Chinese mobile search has the lowest headroom for driving additional good abandonment (just over 9% of abandoned queries). Of potential good abandon-ment queries, in Chinese mobile search over 80% are fully or partially answered on the results page. Again, this appears to be because mobile queries in China target relatively sim-ple information needs that are addressed directly by existing search engine features. As the mobile search market grows and mobile devices become more capable, this may change.
In this section, we further classify potential good aban-donment queries by the type of information need they ex-press. The goal is to identify the major information needs expressed by queries which potentially lead to good aban-donment, and to discover which categories have headroom to drive additional good abandonment. For the rest of this section, we will restrict our analysis to potential abandon-ment queries.

As described above, we allowed categories to emerge as we coded queries, rather than predefining them, and converged on the list of categories shown in Table 2. All queries labeled as  X  X es X  or  X  X aybe X  a potential good abandonment were coded. The percentages of each category of the six potential good abandonment query streams are shown in Figure 3.
As indicated by Figure 3, the distribution of good aban-donment information needs varies enormously across search modalities and locales. Queries seeking local information or short answers are the top classes leading to good aban-donment in PC search, consistently across locales. There are significant portion of entertainment related searches in Japan and China, especially in mobile search.

The large differences across query streams can be seen by listing categories covering over 10% of potential good aban-donment. For US mobile search, they are Local (42.9%), Answer (22.3%), and Stock (11.9%); for Japanese mobile search, Local (24.8%), Answer (20.1%), Celebrities (17.8%) and Images (13.9%); and for Chinese mobile search, Weather (17.9%), Answer (14.7%), Celebrities (14.5%) and News (14.3%). For PC search, the major classes in US search are Local (28.4%) and Answer (20.5%); in Japan, Celebrities (25%), Definition (21.1%), Local (18.4%) and Answer (15.8%); and in China, Local (25.8%) and Answer (22.3%).

The different category distributions across modalities and locales reveal some interesting patterns. Figure 4 highlights five categories worth exploring further.  X  Local  X  search appears to be a large good-abandonment class, with high potential for driving additional good aban-donments in all of the query streams except Chinese mobile. Example (US) queries include [domino X  X  pizza -cary, nc] and [kohls in austin]. One surprising finding is that there are less than 3%  X  X ocal X  potential good abandonment queries for Chinese mobile search. By contrast, it is the top class for Chinese PC search. By examining the actual search results of these Chinese  X  X ocal X  queries, we found that they were poorly addressed on the search results page in many cases. It may be that we see fewer abandoned  X  X ocal X  searches on Chinese mobile search because these searches often do not return the specific information asked for on the results page. Mobile users may have less tolerance because of the extra effort involved to search on mobile devices, where text en-try is difficult and the time of loading a page gets longer. Perhaps mobile searchers  X  X ive up X  more quickly on search-ing categories for which they previously had an unsuccessful experience.  X  Answer  X  is a major class of good abandonment queries across all six query streams . In reviewing the search result pages for these queries, we found that both result snippets and search features such as calculator, definition and news headlines are rich sources for addressing this type of infor-mation need. As search engines improve in these areas (in-troducing more features and providing more intelligent snip-pets), more  X  X nswer X  queries can potentially lead to good abandonment. This has implications for how these types of improvements are evaluated X  X riving more clicks is not always a success.  X  Celebrities  X , where a user seeks for news and/or im-ages of famous people, is most prevalent in Japanese aban-doned queries, but rare in the US. According to several pre-vious studies of random query streams, celebrity searches, which might fall into  X  X ntertainment X  or  X  X ews and current event X  categories in these studies, are popular in US [11, 12] and Japan [4] for both PC and mobile searches. 1 The un-even distribution of  X  X elebrities X  search in our abandoned query streams therefore indicates different user interaction patterns by locale and modality for celebrity topics. Presum-ably, US users click more often when searching celebrities, while Japanese mobile users apparently often browse images or news outlines appearing on the results page.  X  Stock  X  is another interesting category which may indi-cate some differences between the two modalities. While not appearing at all in our Japanese abandonment samples, in the US and China, its prevalence is consistently higher in mobile search. This difference may stem from two factors: First, PC search in general involves larger diversity and less focused search usage. Secondly, the depth of user X  X  infor-mation needs may vary across modalities. For example, a mobile user may just browse the stock quote returned on the results page, since loading additional pages to explore fur-ther is slow on mobile devices. In contrast, a PC user may
We don X  X  know of similar analyses for Chinese queries. click to seek for more information and graphs, and therefore a lower fraction of searches are abandoned.

Finally,  X  Weather  X  search is prevalent only in China mo-bile search. Weather searches account for 18% of Chinese mobile potential good abandonments, but less than 1% of Chinese PC good abandonments, and less than 3% of mo-bile and PC in the other two countries. The large count of simple weather queries may correlate with China being a relatively less mature mobile search market compared to the other two locales.

Next, we turn our attention to exploring which categories present the most opportunities for driving additional good abandonment. By counting queries that are potentially good abandonments, but are not fully answered by the current search results page, we can get a measure of the  X  X eadroom X  for driving further good abandonment in each information need category. Figure 5 shows a heat map of this headroom by category in each locale and modality. Each column rep-resents a locale and modality, and each row represents a cat-egory. Each cell represents a number from 0 to 100, which is a normalized count of  X  X o X  and  X  X aybe X  likely good aban-donments in the category. In our count, each  X  X o X  query counted as 1.0, and each  X  X aybe X  as 0.5. In the heat map, the darker cells represent a count closer to 100 (more head-room), and the lighter cells indicate the counts closer to 0 (less headroom).

As suggested in Figure 5, the current search results page serves fairly well for relatively simple information needs such as  X  X eather X ,  X  X tock X ,  X  X howtimes X , and  X  X pelling X . Several other categories show room for improvement, such as the  X  X ocal X , X  X nswer X , X  X mages X  X nd X  X elebrities X  X ategories. There is an opportunity for search engines to directly address  X  X o-cal X ,  X  X mages X , and perhaps  X  X elebrities X  information needs more often on the results page through more aggressive trig-gering of corresponding  X  X nebox X  or  X  X hortcut X  insertions. For the  X  X nswer X  category, more intelligent snippets would benefit users, especially mobile users, who are seeking for a short answer or news update. It may make sense to dis-play longer snippets that provide more topical information Figure 3: Category distribution (in percentage) of potential good abandonment queries in mobile and PC searches in three countries. The categories are sorted by their prevalence in mobile search for each locale.

Our study has several findings. First, we have shown that queries potentially indicating good abandonment make up a surprisingly large subset of all abandoned queries. Sec-ond, across each of the three locales analyzed, we observe a good abandonment rate on mobile search that is signifi-cantly higher than PC search. Third, broken down by type of information need, the major classes of good abandon-ment vary widely by locale and modality. While some classes are large across all query streams, such as the  X  X ocal X  and  X  X nswers X  categories, others appear significantly only for a specific query stream, such as the  X  X efinition X  category for Japanese mobile search, and the X  X eather X  X ategory for Chi-nese mobile search. Finally, we have identified the categories in each query stream with the most headroom for driving additional good abandonment.

For mobile search, our analysis didn X  X  differentiate searches from top-tier phones, such as the Apple iPhone, from that of conventional mobile phones. Along the same lines, we didn X  X  differentiate among data connection speeds, which vary widely by mobile device and carrier network. Consider-ing that there are likely different search behaviors on higher-end devices, as claimed in a recent study [12] , it would be worthwhile to examine abandonment patterns separately on these devices in the future study.

We used our judgment to hand-classify queries into poten-tial and likely good abandonment buckets and information need categories. While we consider this a more accurate way to classify queries than the automated topical classi-fiers used in most larger-scale analyses [4, 11, 6, 12], the approach is clearly limited. It would be ideal to conduct a large-scale diary study with real search users to get a true gauge of good abandonment from the users X  perspective, and to understand the true information needs involved. 2
One implication of this study is that it is a mistake to uniformly consider query abandonment as a negative signal. Abandonment is no longer always a reflection of user dissat-isfaction. Given the surprisingly large rates of potential and likely good abandonment, it may be that future ranking and evaluation models derived from clicks can be improved by taking good abandonment into account.

Another implication is that there is still an opportunity for search engines to directly address users X  information needs more often by providing the right information on the search results page. That is, for several types of information needs, there is reasonable headroom to drive additional good aban-donment.

This is especially true for mobile search, where there ap-pears to be higher demand for good abandonment in the query stream. Similarly, a recent user study concluded there are more queries per session on computers than on mobile phones, implying that mobile users are less willing to ex-plore topics in depth given the larger barriers to exploration, such as difficult query entry and network latency [12]. For mobile search, perhaps a richer results page with longer or higher quality result snippets, more aggressive triggering of  X  X nebox X  or  X  X hortcut X  results, or more categories of these types of results, would better serve mobile search users.
