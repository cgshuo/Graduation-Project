Number of \ in Train Dev Test Total based on the other nine folds; development and test sentences were tagged using a model based on all ten of the training folds. Dev Test the two languages is that in the Chinese setup we stop with basic Stanford dependencies  X  there is no penalty for further conver-sion; another is not using discriminative reranking for Chinese. 10 An unmatched (default) relation (Chang et al., 2009,  X  3.1). 11 Berkeley X  X  performance suffered with jackknifed tags (76.5 versus 77.0%), possibly because it parses and tags better jointly. 12 Although Mate X  X  performance was not significantly better than Berkeley X  X  in our setting, it has the potential to tap richer features and other advantages of dependency parsers (Nivre and McDonald, 2008) to further boost accuracy, which may be diffi-cult in the generative framework of a typical constituent parser. We thank Daniel Cer, for helping us replicate the English ex-perimental setup and for suggesting that we explore jackknifing methods, and the anonymous reviewers, for valuable comments.
