 Abstract The GOLD Community of Practice is proposed as a model for linking on--line linguistic data to an ontology. The key components of the model include the lin-guistic data resources themselves and those focused on the knowledge derived from data. Data resources include the ever-increasin g amount of linguistic field data and other descriptive language resources being migrated to the Web. The knowledge resources capture generalizations about the data an d are anchored in the General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD). It is argued that such a model is in the spirit of the vision for a Semantic Web and, thus, provides a concrete methodology for rendering highly divergent resources semantically interopera ble. The focus of this work, then, is not on annotation at the syntactic level, but rath er on how annotated Web resources can be linked to an ontology. Furthermore, a methodology is given for creating specific communities of practice within the overall Web infrastructure for linguistics. Finally, ontology-driven search is discussed as a key application of the proposed model.

A simple Web query for even the most obscure language can yield scholarly papers containing richly annotated data, entire Websites dedicated to the description of the language, or even field notes with sound and video files.
