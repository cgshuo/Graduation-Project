 and analyzing the overwhelming found information n eeded for finishing a complex task. In this found relevant information and turn search results into actionable knowledge needed to complete a their patterns in text, and show sample applica tions of such models in tasks such as opinion integration, comparative summarization, contextual topic trend analysis, and event impact analysis. The talk will conclude with a discussion of novel cha llenges raised in extending a search engine to an analysis engine that can go beyond search to provide more complete support for users to finish their tasks.
