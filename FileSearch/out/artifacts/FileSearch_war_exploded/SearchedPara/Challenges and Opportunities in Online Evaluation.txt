 Yandex is one of the largest Internet companies in Europe, operating Russia X  X  most popular search engine, generating 58.6% of all search traffic in Russia (as of April 2015). As all modern search engines, Yandex increasingly relies on on-line evaluation methods such as A/B tests and interleav-ing. These online evaluation methods test various changes in the search engine by analyzing the changes in the charac-ter of its interactions with its users. There are several grand challenges in online evaluation, including the choice of an appropriate online metric and the need to deal with the lim-ited number of user interactions available for a search engine for experimentation. In my talk, I will overview our latest research on improving the sensitivity of well-known online metrics, on the discovery of more sensitive and robust online metrics, on scheduling and early stopping of online experi-ments.
