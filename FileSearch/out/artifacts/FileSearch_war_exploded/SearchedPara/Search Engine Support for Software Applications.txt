 Question-answering, computer-assisted language learning, text mining, and other software applications that use a full-search engine to find information in a large text corpus are becoming common. A software application may use metadata and text annotations to reduce the mismatch between the concept-based representations c onvenient for inference and the word-based representations typically used for text retrieval. So ftware applications may al so be able to specify detailed requirements that retrieved passages must satisfy. This use of text search is very different than the ad-hoc, interactive search that info rmation retrieval research typically studies. Search engine developers are beginning to res pond by extending indexing and retrieval models developed for structured (e.g., XML) documents to support multip le representations of document content, text annotations, metadata, and relationshi ps. These new requirements force developers to reconsider basic assumptions about index data structures and ranked retrieval models. How best to use these new capabilities is an op en problem. Straightforward transformation of a detailed information need into a complex structured query can produce a query that is effective for exact-match retrieval, but a challenge for the retrieval model to use effectively for best-match retrieval. Bag-of-words retrieval is often disparaged, but its a dvantage is that it is robust: It works well even when desired documents do not exactly meet expectations. This talk discusses some of the problems encoun tered when extending a search engine to support queries posed by other software applications and structured docu ments with derived annotations.

Prior to joining CMU he was a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Massachusetts, where he also received his Ph.D. His research and teaching focus on text-based in formation retrieval, primarily search engine architectures, federated search of groups of search engines, ad aptive information filtering, text mining, and information retrieva l for educational applications. He has published more than 150 scientific papers. He is the Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS) and was a founding Editor-in-Chief of Foundations a nd Trends in Information Retrieval (FnTIR). He has served as Chair of ACM SIGIR, and Program Chair of the SIGIR and CIKM conferences.
