 Twitter, as one of the most popular social media platforms, provides a convenient way for peopl e to communicate and interact with each other. It has been well recognized that influence exists during users X  interactions. Some pioneer studies on finding influential users have been reported in the literature, but they do not distinguish different influence roles, which are of great value for various marketing purposes. In this paper, we move a step forward trying to further distinguish influence roles of Twitter users in a certain topic. By defining three views of features relating to topic, sentiment and popularity resp ectively, we propose a Multi-view Influence Role Clustering (MIRC) algorithm to group Twitter users into five categories. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in inferring influence roles.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  clustering Algorithms, Design, Experimentation Twitter; Influential users; Multi-view Nowadays, Twitter has become one of the most popular social media platforms for people to shar e their attitudes or minds. It also allows people to communi cate with each other based on following or friend relationships . The interaction makes it possible for users to influence each other and further creates opportunities for business companies to conduct online marketing activities [1]. More and more business companies have paid much attention to locating influentia l users and manipulating their opinions to attract potential customers or improve sales. Understanding influential users over large-scale networks is crucial to business ma rketing management. Though all influential users perfor m influence on others, Brown and Hayes [2] have verified that the way people use to influence others varies and as a result di fferent kinds of influence produce different effects. Someone st rongly praises a product and persuades others to buy. Someone changes others X  opinions with professional analysis. Someone tim ely informs others the latest news of a product. And someone promotes the product by the popularity. Clearly, influential users play different influence roles. Meanwhile, according to marketing research, a company may have different objectives in different promotion stages, and need the users with different influence roles to conform with [2]. For example, a company who targets to improve product brand awareness may want to seek help from the users with high popularity. However, for a comp any whose product quality is questioned by customers, it may be a better choice to invite domain experts who have professional knowledge to explain and convince customers. Obviously, se lecting specific influence roles in accordance with various marketing objectives is more effective than just looking for influential users. This motivates us to further analyze and infer users X  influence roles in this work.
 To better describe influence ro les, we develop five distinct categories, i.e., fans, informatio n disseminator, expert, celebrity and others, based on the definition of influence role in the influencer guidebook [3]. The descriptions of them are summarized in Table 1 below.
 Most previous work on influential user identification exploits the features like the numbers of follo wers and/or retweets and/or mentions [4, 5]. However, these features are not adequate to distinguish influence roles. With reference to the influencer guidebook, we define three views to represent Twitter users and to infer their influence roles. Among them, the topic-view describes users X  interests to the specific topic. The sentiment-view is related to the opinions expressed by the users. The popularity-view represents the reputation degree of users. Although each view can only partially reflect the influence roles from its own perspective, the three views together provide more complete information for inferring influence roles when they complement with each other. Based on these three views, we propose a Multi-view Influence Role Clustering (MIRC) algorithm to partition influential users into five categories. Unlike existing multi-view clustering algorithms, we allow the cluster numbers in different views to be different. Then we leverage the cluster information from different views to form the final clustering results. The expe rimental results on inferring influence roles demonstrate the superiority of MIRC over various existing single-view clustering, multi-view clustering and a baseline approaches. There exist several pioneer studies on ranking influential users in social networks. Agarwal et. al . [6] proposed a preliminary model to identify influential blog users based on the statistics of their posts, like the posts to which the author refers, and the posts that refer to this post, etc. In [4], three measurements, i.e., the number of followers, the number of retweets and the number of mentions, were used to rank the influence of Twitter users. Cha et al . [4] noticed that there were different categories of infl uential users, without give a clear and comprehe nsive definition of influential user categories. Weng et al. [5] proposed the TwitterRank, which was extended from PageRank, to identify influential Twitter users by taking both the link structure and the topical similarity into consideration. Bakshy et al. [7], on the other hand, focused on the repost rates. By tracking 74 mil lion diffusion events in Twitter, they demonstrated that under most circumstances the individuals with less-than-average influenc e were more cost-effective for marketing. This suggested that the most popular users were not necessarily the most influential users and there was a need to define distinct influence roles. While prior work considered finding influential users as a retrieval task, they failed to distinguish different influence roles. To take one step further, our work aims to cluster influential users into a certain groups according to their specific roles. We describe influence roles from three different views relating to topic, sentiment and popularity, and propose an approach, namely Multi-view Influence Role Clustering (MIRC) to infer the topic-dependent influence roles of Twitter users. The topic-view describes the interest s of a user to a specific topic. Thus, the topic profile is the core and needs to be constructed first. To start with, the topic word(s) like  X  iPhone  X  is selected as the seed word(s). Then, using the mutual information, the K most relevant words that co-occur with the seed word(s) within a window of size (i.e., two in our experiments) are extracted as the topical keywords and form the topic profile. These K words can provide a more complete picture of the whole topic. For all tweets capture his/her word distribution over the extracted topical words. The sentiment-view reveals the preferred attitudes when one expresses opinions. The attitudes with different influence roles can be different. For example, for a product, its fans tend to give all positive feedback, while experts may express both positively and negatively based on their analysis from the facts. In order to catch the sentiment of tweets, we use the sentiment lexicon AFINN labeled by Nielsen [8], where each word is attached with an integer value between negative five and positive five denoting its sentiment polarity and st rength. Based on AFINN, the sentiment score of a tweet is calculated by aggregating the sentiment strengths of all the words in it. For a given user, we compute the average positive-sentiment scores and average negative-sentiment scores to repr esent two attributes in sentiment-view. Apart from the topical content and the sentiment representations, the popularity (or say the authority) of one user also indicates his/her influence role. We select three representative features that usually used to represent the popul arity of a person for this view, including the number of followers, the number of followees and a binary value indicating if a user has a verified account or not, officially provided by Twitter Inc. To obtain a better performance for the dataset that gives representations from different feature spaces, multi-view clustering approaches are proposed to partition data into clusters by integrating the features from multiple views, rather than relying on the features from a single view [9]. They have been successfully applied in various applications, like objective recognition [10], document clustering [11], and handwriting recognition [9]. These approaches share a common assumption, i.e., the features in each view are sufficient for clustering and thus the cluster numbers in differen t views are same. However, from our previous analysis, a singl e view alone cannot partition influential users well into five categories of influence roles. This is because a single view can only depict a specific aspect of influence roles. Therefore, it is more reasonable to allow the cluster numbers of different views to be different. For example, fans, information disseminators and experts have more interests in the topic than celebrities and others. The topic representations of fans, information disseminators a nd experts tend to be distinct from celebrities. Likewise, the sentiment representations tend to differentiate the fans who always post tweets with positive sentiments, the information di sseminators whose tweets are mainly neutral ones, and the e xperts whose opinions may be negative. And the popularity view tends to distinguish Twitter users with different degree of popul arity. It appears that each view infers different aspects of influence roles. To combine partial distinction ability of each single view together, our proposed approach groups data into different clusters (i.e., local clusters) based on each single view first, and then use the local cluster information to form the final influence role clusters (i.e., global clusters). On this basis, the Multi-view Influence Role Clustering (MIRC) algorithm is proposed. It can be formally described as follows. Let 12  X  , ,...,  X  number of users. A user can be represented by multi-view features. Let the local cluster number for the view v be the global cluster number is t . The goal of MIRC is to partition the users U into t clusters with the m -view features. This can be formulated as the following optimization problem. where G i represents the global clus ter assignment for the user u and it satisfies 1-of-K coding scheme, i.e., the user u the users assigned to the cluster r are all in the local cluster k . The must be mapped to at least one global cluster, and every global Given i G and  X  X  X  v P , () v i GP can be seen as the local cluster center in the v -th view, and  X  X  X  v  X  is the factor vector to balance the weight of each view and it is initialized manually.
 To solve the minimization problem above, we propose an iterative updating procedure. According to [10], we rewrite the objective where and We apply the following iterative updating procedure to solve the above minimization problem. The objective function in Equation (2) is differentiated with setting the derivation to zero. We separately update every row of G , i.e., G i each view, for user u i , we find the local cluster for it that minimizes the distance between it and its assigned local cluster. candidate matrices that satisfy the constraints. These are the four main iteration phases in MIRC. Each phase is a convex problem which is related to one variable and converges to a local optimal solution. As a result, the whole algorithm is guaranteed to converge to its local solution. After clustering, we assign each cluster to a category of influence roles by employing the method for evaluation of clustering [12]. We choose the assignment that ma ximizes the average precision on experimental data as the ma ppings from user clusters to influence roles. We choose the topic  X  iPhone  X  to conduct the preliminary experiments for influence role clustering on Twitter. Using the Twitter function  X  X ho to follow X  and taking  X  iPhone  X  as the search query, we select top ten users as seed users. Then we crawl down the English followers of these seed users, and assume that they all have certain interests in the topic and have the ability to influence others more or less [13]. Altogether, we collect about 900 thousands users and monitor their postings from Sep 1 Oct 31 st , 2013. To guarantee the diversity of influence roles, the top 10K most followed users and the top 10K users posting tweets that contain  X  iPhone  X  most are selected to form the set of influential users. Among them, 5120 users, together with their postings and account information, are randomly selected for the preliminary experiments. Due to the lack of annotated datasets, we randomly select 160 users from these 5120 influential users and manually annotate their influence roles for the evaluation purpose. Annotators are invited to identify the influence roles for each user, and we finally get the consensus of all annotator s to make up our experiment dataset. The annotated user numbe r of each category of influence roles is listed in Table 2. We compare MIRC with (1) the baseline K-means clustering (BKC) [14], which concatenates all features together; (2) two existing multi-view clustering approaches including Multi-view K-means Clustering (MKC) [10] and Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based Multi-view Clustering (NMFMC) [9]. We also compare with (3) K -means Clustering (SC) on the three single views we design, which are indicated by SC and SC account , respectively. For all approaches, we calculate the cosine similarities between users with the features in the topic representation, and regard the cosine similarity vector of each user as his/her features in topic view. The cosine similarity features perform well in the experiment. Besides, the features in the three views are all normalized to [0, 1] before they are fed into.
 Specifically, we set the cluster number of topic view to 2 representing whether users show thei r interests to the topic or not, set the cluster number of sentiment view to 3 representing negative, neutral and positive se ntiments, and set the cluster number of account view to 3 de scribing high, medium and low contribution of single view clusteri ng to the multi-view clustering is set to (0.0125, 0.6305, 0.35 70) empirically. In addition, MKC and  X  in NMFMC are set to 0.1 and 0.01 respectively for their best performances . Single-view Clustering Multi-view Clustering We use three commonly-used metrics for the performance evaluation. They are macro-average precision (MP), macro-average recall (MR), and macro-average F-measure (MF). As shown in Table 3, the performan ce of the proposed MIRC beats all others in all three metrics. By setting different cluster numbers for different views, we get more accurate results than the other multi-view clustering approaches. Roughly, the multi-view clustering MKC and NMFKC without such a setting perform comparably with the single-view clustering. It appears to be a good idea to use the local clusteri ng information of each view to infer a better global clustering result. Meanwhile, by adding multiple views features rather than a single view to build a more complete user representation, it is not surprising to see that MIRC outperforms all single-view clustering. In this work, we address the i ssue of inferring Topic-Dependent influence role. We propose a Multi-view Influence Role Clustering (MIRC) algorithm to partition Twitter users into five clusters with three views of features including topic view, sentiment view and popularity view . In MIRC, different cluster numbers are allowed for different views. The expe riment results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In the future, we will continue to explore more features (e.g., representative words in user profiles) and/or exploit other models like the language models to furthe r improve performances.
