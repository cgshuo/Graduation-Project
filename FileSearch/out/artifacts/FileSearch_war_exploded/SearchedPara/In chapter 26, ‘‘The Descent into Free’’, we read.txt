 In chapter 26,  X  X  X he Descent into Free X  X , we read with interest about the coming to life of new journals like
Infoworld in 1980, PC Magazine in 1982 and Wired in 1993. With the appearance of the World Wide Web individuals were now not only producing and reproducing printed information on their own, but now  X  X  X heir written personal communicating reached literally ethereal speeds X  X  (p. 335). Everyone was now a writer and everyone a publisher. Yet in all of this explosion of digital information, according to Sonn, information still remained as a printed product since  X  X  X aper was everywhere X  X  (p. 337).

This excellent book by Sonn therefore makes us realize that we are in an era that is really not unique in terms of the information explosion and widened access to information and the associated consequences.
The uniqueness is possibly only in the degree of the information explosion. There have been other eras where access to information by individuals was expanded, where elite intermediaries between knowledge and individ-uals had been eliminated, causing upheaval, significant changes in man and society and speculation about the demise of civilization as we know it (the demise of books, of libraries and so on).

On coming to the end of this book, we can almost imagine a sequel where Sonn would address the open access movement, changes in scholarly communication and the effect of the  X  X  X reeing X  X  of the published word on publishers and researchers. This intriguing book is highly recommended to the readers of Information Processing and Management.

This is the first sentence of the first chapter of the first part of the book. The Wealth of Networks  X  How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, by Professor Yochai Benkler. Professor Benkler is the
Joseph M. Field  X 55 Professor of Law at Yale. This book should be on your summer reading list if you care about information technology, the digital global economy and their affects on society at large. Wealth of Networks is a remarkable book by any measure. The coverage is quite complete and up-to-date.
From SETI@home, Slashdot, Wikipedia, and the war in Iraq to some of the latest and most relevant court cases, Benkler connects the dots masterfully and comprehensively. Each chapter includes a full set of citations to scholarly and other works that alone is worth the price of the book. His central thesis is that non-market forces have always been a source of innovation. One need only look to the industrial research centers of the latter 20th century operated by corporations such as General Electric, Bell Telephone, DuPont, and Mobil Oil for evidence of mostly cloistered, proprietary research laboratories dedicated to invention and innovation but with enormous overhead costs and capital investments.

Today, driven by the Web and Internet, social, or commons production, based on information can be done anywhere, anytime by almost anyone and this activity has and will radically reshape market places and econ-omies because it is non-proprietary and requires so little capital investment. Yes, some market giants, have embraced the open innovation shareware ethic and in so doing have built a new business around it  X  IBM for example with LINUX, but most companies are just starting to understand this movement and most have not even begun. Yet, understand they must and so too must governments, since this is not just about the open source movement and non-market forces impacting business, it is also about empowerment impinging on pol-itics, law, human rights, justice and global opportunity.

Benkler sees the future of the digital global economy, neither as dystopia, nor utopia, but pragmatically as a new and different era radically changed from the purely industrial production economies of the recent past and present. This is not a new idea, but he states it so much more rationally, logically and factually than many of his predecessors. His take on topics such as the Babel objection to the Internet is as clean and empirical an analysis as one can find. Throughout the book you have to admire the articulation of his arguments, even if you may not fully agree with his conclusions.

The book has three parts. Part one, The Networked Information Economy , is very well done and the chap-ters on P2P and the economics of social production are very good reviews for some and will provide insight-ful introductions to these topics for others. Part two, The Political Economy of Property and Commons ,hasa chapter entitled  X  X  X ustice and Development X  X  that is as overall thought provoking as it is compelling. Part three, Policies of Freedom at a Moment of Transformation , concludes with the final chapter,  X  X  X he Stakes of Information Law and Policy X  X , that will be of interest to practitioners, as well as for the more general reader.

The text is 475 pages, but it is well worth the effort to get through it. The writing is mostly clear, but in places it is admittedly turgid. The density stems from the fact that every sentence matters  X  there are no breaks for the reader  X  Benkler has a lot to say this is a core dump. In keeping with the subject matter and thesis, the book was published under a Creative Commons license.

This book could be the basis for a superb graduate level course in any of the i-schools; maybe it could even be taught in conjunction with law colleagues. Outside of academia  X  corporate professionals need to read this for a different point of view than the standard fare that emerges from business schools on this and related topics.

However, you look at it  X  this book is worth reading, but it may be a little heavy for the beach  X  but not for the summer! Intelligent Internet Knowledge Networks: Processing of Concepts and Wisdom. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey. October 2006, ISBN:-10: 0 471 78856 2
Dr. Ahamed brings about a dramatic confluence of human intelligence, Internet, knowledge environments and broadband networks in his most recent book. A brief look back over the last couple of decades into the evolution of the knowledge society reminds us that the current designs of computing machines deserve a long hard look into the philosophy of their purpose, design, and utilization. Much like the fiber optic technology that has altered our perception of communication networks, the architectures proposed by Dr. Ahamed in this
