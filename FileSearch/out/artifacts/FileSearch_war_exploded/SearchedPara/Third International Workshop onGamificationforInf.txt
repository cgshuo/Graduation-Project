 Stronger engagement and greater participation is often cru-cial to reach a goal or to solve an issue. Issues like the emerg-ing employee engagement crisis, insufficient knowledge shar-ing, and chronic procrastination. In many cases we need and search for tools to beat procrastination or to change people X  X  habits. Gamification is the approach to learn from often fun, creative and engaging games. In principle, it is about un-derstanding games and applying game design elements in a non-gaming environments. This offers possibilities for wide area improvements. For example more accurate work, better retention rates and more cost effective solutions by relating motivations for participating as more intrinsic than conven-tional methods. In the context of Information Retrieval (IR) it is not hard to imagine that many tasks could benefit from gamification techniques. Besides several manual annotation tasks of data sets for IR research, user participation is im-portant in order to gather implicit or even explicit feedback to feed the algorithms. Gamification, however, comes with its own challenges and its adoption in IR is still in its in-fancy. Given the enormous response to the first and second GamifIR workshops that were both co-located with ECIR, and the broad range of topics discussed, we now organized the third workshop at SIGIR 2016 to address a range of emerging challenges and opportunities.
The purpose of the GamifIR workshop series is to bring together researchers and practitioners from a wide range of areas including game design, IR, human-computer interac-tion, computer games, and natural language processing in order to promote the development and exchange of research ideas and results relating to emerging areas of gamification within the context of IR.
 Many research challenges in the field of IR rely on te-
The workshop was advertised via various Call for Papers that were distributed to relevant mailing lists, forums, and social media platforms. A website 2 was set up to provide further information and the Twitter account @GamifIR was used to promote the workshop.
All submitted papers went through a semi-blind peer-reviewing process where each submission was reviewed by at least three experts in the field. The workshop proceed-ings have been published by CEUR. 3 Papers were presented at the workshop on 21 July 2016 in Pisa, Italy. Given the co-location of the workshop with the SIGIR conference, the event mainly attracted researchers working in the field of IR who presented their preliminary work on applying gamification to perform various IR related tasks such as crowdsourced document annotation, relevance assessment or interactive search.
