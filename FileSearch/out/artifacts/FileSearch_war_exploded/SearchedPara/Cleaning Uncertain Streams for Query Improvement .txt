 Real-world applications such as sensor and RFID networks [1] generate uncertain streams inevitably. In the applications, data uncertainty is mostly due to some external and/or defective data processing algorithms. Considering video surveillance applica-Uncertainty exists widely and cannot be eliminated in the near future. 
Query processing in the probabilistic database is on the basic of Possible World semantics, and possible worlds (i.e. the processing cost) increases exponentially with the tuples involved. Research work is proposed for evaluating probabilistic queries in a polynomial time ( safe query ) [6], when possible worlds need not to be enumerated in the processing. While queries may be not safe , and data transmission is a potential the efficiency in streaming environment. quality and volume by Probabilistic Graphical Models and probabilistic queries respectively. Our contributions include:  X 
We propose a parallelized framework for high-volume stream environment, as well as a generalized one for users to append queries and Probabilistic Graphical models implied in the application context.  X

Probabilistic Data Management. Recent research work of probabilistic databases is mostly concerned about data structure and query processing. Two basic types of prob-and research work is proposed for polynomial-time evaluation [6]. 
We adopt x-relation data model in our prototype [5]. An x-relation is an uncertain  X  two kinds of x-tuple s in video surveillance application, with the same time t and posi-tion (posx, posy) , or the same t and person id (pid) . 
Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) is used in modeling and reasoning about probabilistic data [1]. Some research adopts the First-Order ( FO ) model [3], an evo-lution of traditional PGM, in which random variables represent sets of random parameters. PGMs are always implemented as user views for hiding data details from users, and then queries are evaluated over them [2]. 
Query processing over uncertain streams ga ins much attention recently [1] [7]. The work aims at cleaning uncertain streams by application context to improve data quali-efficiency). Fig. 2 (a) shows that the framework consists of PGM and Query cleaning processes, and (b) shows our prototype of video survei llance application over the architecture. 3.1 Module Description rule deployment. The reason of stream reorganization is that, original uncertain streams in applications are not always ready for parallelization. Considering the video over the videos derived from cameras, records for the same person may appear across the streams. Then we assign PersonID as the divided attribute, and produce new streams corresponding to individual persons, which can be processed by different threads in parallel. 
Cleaning Rule Deployment parallelizes cleaning rule evaluation on reorganized uncertain streams, and outputs cleaned streams. A cleaning rule is submitted by users as a java file implementing specified APIs, and can share identical algorithms among processing order of them, or system executes all rules simultaneously. 
Probabilistic Query Filter generates cleaned uncertain dataset specific for probabil-quent processing. It takes cleaned streams processed by PGM Cleaning as input, and generates further cleaned streams for each query. 3.2 Cleaning Rules in Video Surveillance Application In video surveillance application, system gets video streams from cameras, and processes them by face identification and position computation. Specifically, each person-like object in a video frame is represented by several uncertain tuples with the his possible position in the next second is II , we suppose that the probability distribu-= 0 if A is most likely to stay still over time, and  X  can be viewed as the moving speed and differs in various environments. Moreover, given A  X  X  position II at t+1 , his posi-Pos T+1 .

If there is a selective query Q (SQL query with a selective WHERE clause) over a uncertain dataset D of x-tuples, we de-and t i is a tuple with existence uncertainty. satisfy Q X  X  WHERE clause, we have that Q(D) = Q(D-T) (D-T denotes the dataset of all x-tuples in D except T). converse. The first case is that r must result from T (or partly from). While all t i in T query, r satisfies Q X  X  WHERE clause and r is in Q(D). We get the contradiction.  X  and t m+1 , t m+2 , ..., t n does not satisfy Q, we have that Q(D) = Q(D X ), while D X  denotes Proof. If Q(D)  X  Q(D X ), there is a result r in Q(D) but not in Q(D X ), or the converse. query, r satisfies Q X  X  WHERE clause and r is also in Q(D). We get the contradiction.  X  that Q(D) = Q(D-T+T X ). Q(D-T+T X ), or the converse. In the first case, r must result from T but not T X  (or part-result from T X  as well. We get the contradiction. In the second case, for Q is a selec-tive query, r satisfies Q X  X  WHERE clause. If r results from t X , r also results form t i (or t ) and r is in Q(D). If r is irrespective of t X , r is also in Q(D).We get the contradiction as well. If there is a result r in Q(D) and r X  in Q(D-T+T X ), r and r X  is the identical re-sult except for existence probabilities. By Possible World definition, we have that all latter X  X  probabilities is the sum of the former X  X  correspondingly. That is, r and r X  have the identical existence probabilities. We get the contradiction as well.  X  Uncertain streams are generated widely in real-world applications, while most of the query on uncertain data based on Possible World semantic makes great processing cost, for possible worlds increase with related tuples exponentially. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for cleaning uncer tain streams by application context and probabilistic queries, and we implement a prototype of video surveillance application over the framework.
