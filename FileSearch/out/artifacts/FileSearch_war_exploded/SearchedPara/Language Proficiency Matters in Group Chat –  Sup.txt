 Cross-cultural group chat is an important communication method in organizational and educationa l settings. Studies have shown that communication problems exist persistently due to non-native and native speakers X  unmatched levels of language proficiency. Realizing the profound problem and increasing need for better communication from the real world, in my dissertation I am stud-ying the communication processes associated of cross-cultural group chat and explore possible tools to assist both non-native and native speakers to communicate better. H.5.3 [ Information interfaces and presentation ]: Group and organization interfaces  X  Computer-supported cooperative work; Keywords : Cross-cultural, group chat, language proficiency. Cross-cultural communication is taking place everywhere as the world is getting flat. Research conducted across many disciplines (e.g. education, psycholinguis tics, sociology, HCI and CSCW) shows that language proficiency pl ays an important role in com-munication. Non-native speakers have been suffering from com-munication problems caused by la nguage proficiency issues both in face-to-face (FTF) communication and distributed online communication [2,5]. Building upon past studies, my research interests in cross-cultural communication focus on non-native speakers X  problems in text-based computer-mediated communication (CMC). Comparison studies show that text-based CMC is beneficial to non-native speakers. It requires less immediacy in response than is often the case in FTF communication, and allows more equality through increases in social distance (e .g., more anonymity). However, studies also show that non-native speakers experience frustration in text-based CMC, frustration that is directly linked to language proficiency issues [3]. To help non-native speakers communicate with better quality and experience, I propose a novel tool for text-based communication. The tool o ffers an additional channel for responding to missed points, inde xing important ideas, and ad-dressing different understandings; by so doing, I hope to enable more natural and coherent co mmunication between native and non-native speakers. In particular, I expect the tool to promote non-native speakers X  participation and positive attitudes in cross-cultural communication. Furthermore, I expect that at least part of this effect will be due to an in crease in native speakers X  awareness of  X  and accommodation to  X  the mismatches in communication between them and their non-native counterparts. Although researchers from different multiple disciplines have recognized communication problems in cross-cultural group chats, there is a scarcity in th e literature specifying these users X  needs and requirements for those chat systems, as evidenced by the small number of tools aimed specifically at cross-cultural communication. Given the difficulties that non-native speakers experience when using existing communication methods, I have begun to explore the needs and re quirements of mixed groups of non-native and native speakers, with the design research goal of developing and evaluating new ways to assist them so that they can better communicate with each other. Several earlier works have noted that non-native speakers are frustrated by the parallel discussi on and rapid turn-taking typical of online chat [1,3]; these issues do not seem to be a problem for native speakers. In light of this literature, I have synthesized two streams of design research -threaded chat and collaborative anno-tation -and envisioned an enhancement to group chat called In-stant Annotation (IA). Presently, IA is a conceptual design in which participants use a parallel channel to annotate or otherwise comment on an ongoing discussion. Fi gure 1 shows a snap shot of my initial IA prototype, currently under development and itera-tive refinement. I expect that IA will assist information retention and conversation management in cross-cultural communication. RQ1. What are the differences between non-native and native speakers X  reading and writing capacity in group text chat? Research has shown that native speakers X  reading comprehension and writing skills are superior to non-native speakers in tradition-al reading and writing tasks [4,7]. Recently, Specker [6] com-pared non-native and native speakers X  reading speed in reading scrolling texts. Results showed th at native speakers are still faster than non-native speakers. However, little work has been done to investigate such contrasts for s ituations involving dynamic infor-mation contexts, such as synchronous chats. RQ2. If there are differences, how does it impact the group and members of the group? If there are differences in terms of language proficiency, how does it affect members X  experience in online group work; how does it affect their performance; and eventually how does it affect group outcomes? Many factors affect non-native speakers in group chats, including communica tion anxiety and low self-confidence about language skills or other relevant background knowledge [1]. Other factors such as power inequity, intimacy level, and gender may also affect an individual X  X  feeling [1]; however these factors are not the focus of this study, so I plan to control them in my experiments. Another possible source of frus-tration may arise from the native speakers, rather than the non-native speakers. Native speakers may implicitly construct a dis-cussion sub-group upon recognition of similar background, un-derstandings and communication style; if so, non-native speakers may feel excluded. Furthermore, native speakers may even ignore non-native speakers X  opinions due to insufficient attention to or communication with participants who they view as outsiders. Another important question is whether frustration will lead to low participation. Participation play s an important role in any group work; therefore examining whether non-native speakers partici-pate at a high level, and if not how to enhance participation are among the core pursuits of my study. Finally, I want to explore the consequences of any low participation on group outcomes. RQ3. Will a chat client featur ing IA help reducing the above problems? Does Instant Annotation increas e non-native speakers X  participa-tion? Does Instant Annotation improve the communication expe-rience of non-native speakers? Does Instant Annotation improve group outcomes? To investigate RQ3, I will use methodology that is similar to that used for RQ2. Participants will use a text-based chat for a group discussion, and similar measures of performance and experience will be collected. However in this study, some groups will work with a custom chat client that features IA, while others will use the same clie nt but without IA support. This study addressed RQ1 and RQ 2, drawing design implications for the detailed design and implementation of an IA-enhanced chat tool. I conducted an experime nt (using a brainstorming task) to investigate non-native and native speakers X  communication processes in group text chat, as well as probing their experiences in a survey and follow-up intervie w. The results showed that lan-guage proficiency did affect non-native speakers X  participation and performance. More interestingly, I found that native speakers X  performance was also impacted because they sometimes reserved their ideas to give non-native speakers more chance to speak, which resulted in production loss in the brainstorming task. The major problem I found in this study was that unmatched levels of language proficiency impaired the turn-taking system in online chat, resulted in mismatched conversations and parallel sub-conversations, which in turn discouraged non-native speakers X  participation due to the high worklo ad to repair the conversations. My current work focuses on RQ3. I have prototyped a text chat system featuring IA. I will be designing and working from several different scenarios of users interacting over the system. The sce-narios will address different po ssible use cases of IA, drawing from users X  reflections obtained in study 1. I will use confederates to enact these scenarios and recruit native and non-native speak-ers to chat with them. Each par ticipant will finish two chat ses-sions, one that uses the IA sp ace and one without. Results from the two conditions will be compared to find out whether the IA design is useful (whether problems found in study 1 can be re-duced) and in what use cases it is particularly useful or problem-atic. Based on the findings of this study, I will create a task in which IA is most useful and as k naturalistic groups (i.e., no con-federates) to complete the task. I will assess design features, us-ers X  satisfaction, and performance and group outcomes in this summative evaluation. [1] Freiermuth, M. and Jarrell, D.
