 In the conventional process of periodical review, appointing experts is usually an arti fi cial work. Many people criticize the use of only arti to pre-read all papers. In addition, reviewers might be invited to review some papers that do not match their research interest. Also, only using the arti somewhat subjective, which might potentially lead to the potential unfairness. There-fore, when recommending the expert as a reviewer, experts expected to be modeled accurately. In view of the above issues, in this study, a novel topic model is proposed, named the Author Subject Topic (AST) model, to help editors select right reviewers.
 and research papers in the fi eld of Information Systems and Management was built. which characterizes modern trends in the research fi eld. To obtain the corresponding Science Foundation of China 1 from 2004 to 2014 in this area are selected as seed experts (256 unique seed experts in total). Next, according to research papers of seed experts, co-experts are found in WANFANG DATA. Finally, 5,519 unique scholars and 75,880 papers abstracts are obtained.
 Some interesting phenomena are observed when this dataset is explored. Scholars in Information Systems and Management are found to have a very broad range of WANFANG DATA. For example, the subjects of Feicheng Ma  X  s research papers WANFANG DATA may belong to Education, Economy, Industrial Technology, General Social Science, Mathematical Science and Chemistry. The research interests of Yuying Jiao 3 , another famous scholar in this research fi Economy, Industrial Technology, Transportation and General Social Science. Also, many other similar cases can be easily observed in this research area. Considering this ignores the similarity of documents from different authors, and the topic distribution associated with each author is the only focused in terms of the author ments. Since the research fi eld in this dataset is dispersed, only one single topic distribution to model an author  X  s research interests has signi to a document class layer in the Author Interest Topic (AIT) model [ 2 ], the inner similarity of documents is introduced into the proposed AST model to reduce topic noises. The differences between the AST model with the other author topic models, such as the AT model and the AIT model, are: fi rst, the AST model introduces a supervised  X  Subject  X  layer for grouping documents [ 3 ]. Second, unlike the AIT model that gives each document a class label, the AST model gives each document a subject distribution, considering the fact that each document may cover several subjects. The fi rst contribution of this research is that a novel probabilistic model is intro-duced for expert recommendation, which takes an expert  X  s interdisciplinary research many existing models. Another contribution of this study lies in that not only the text information but also other available metadata information is borrowed in the AST model. It aims to capture the latent connection between authors, subject labels and words.
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2 , some relevant studies on expert recommendation and topic model are reviewed. In Sect. 3 , the author subject topic model is proposed and the Gibbs Sampling approach is utilized for parameter estimation. Different experiments are conducted and comparative results are presented in Sect. 4 . Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sect. 5 . 2.1 Expert Recommendation Based on the conventional information retrieval, expert recommendation is often regar-ded as an effective solution to ease the information overload by helping users to matching experts from a large number of candidates. In this aspect, some scholars bor-rowed the metadata such as co-authors, h-index, document quantity, etc., which might be classi fi er combining ten types of metadata value such as a score de took use full of the experts  X  social relationship when recommending Program Committee members [ 5 ]. Moreira used the method of data fusion, in which multiple sensors were built. Each sensor was responsible for getting speci fi c information on experts and expert recommendation. The major concerns are to build the social networks of candi-These relationships are embodied in potential communications, and they can re experts  X  authority and in fl uence [ 7  X  9 ].
 cannot exactly determine experts  X  research interests. Second, an expert who has superior authority in an academic social network does not necessarily mean that he/she work also cannot fully determine the expert  X  s research pro 2.2 Topic Modeling Recently, many generative topic models are applied for expert recommendation. An is a generative model that represents each document with a mixture of topics. The AT model substitutes the author layer for document layer, allowing each author to be represented by a mixture of topics. Jie Tang extended the AT model by adding the publication venue, which means that each author  X  s topic is correlated with the word and conference stamp; the application of the Author Conference Topic (ACT) model can then be used to retrieve the experts and conferences [ 11 ]. The Author Conference Topic Connection (ACTC) model [ 12 ] and the Author Citation Venue Topic (ACVT) model [ 13 ] extended the ACT model by adding the subject layer and citation infor-mation. The Author Persona Topic (APT) model [ 14 ] introduced a persona layer, which allows authors  X  documents to be divided into one or more clusters, with each cluster being related to that persona. The Author Interest Topic (AIT) model [ 2 ] and Latent Interest Topic (LIT) model [ 15 ] extended the APT model, which introduced the interest layer and author class layer that can be shared among different authors to reduce the noise.
 3.1 The Probabilistic Generative Model Intuitively, when people talk about a discipline system in a certain structure might be formed in their minds. The root is a macro concept, and the leaves are the speci fi c pieces of research content related to the macro concept. The same system can be used to describe an expert  X  s discipline system. An expert would have some  X  Subject  X  that he is interested in. Under these subjects, there is a distribution of topics that can explain the meaning of the subject.
 Following that train of thought, in this research, a novel topic model, the Author Subject Topic (AST) model, is proposed, which is an extension of the AT model. In Fig. 1 , the AT model and the AST model are compared.
 The difference between the AT model and the AST model is that the latter intro-duces a supervised  X  Subject  X  layer, which can be shared among different authors. In contrast with the AST model, the AT model only learns the topic distribution with the authors  X  own documents and lacks the consideration on the similarity of documents, which might induce some noises. The  X  Subject  X  layer of the AST model is similar to the  X 
Class  X  layer of the AIT model, which motivates to divide different documents into several groups. The difference between them is that the  X  In this research, the subject categories of an expert can be collected in the WANFANG DATA, as these subject labels are given by the author. Accordingly, the  X 
Subject  X  layer in the AST model is more accurate than the model. Furthermore, in the AIT model, each document is given a class label from the class distribution, which can be regarded as a hard classi AST model, each document is given a subject distribution from a which can be regarded as a soft classi fi cation. The soft classi practical since the selected Information Systems and Management is a cross-domain and many papers span several of these subjects. For example, a paper entitled  X 
Study of Information Science Development and Education  X  X  subjects such as Education. Despite the fact that it is convenient for a paper to be assigned to a category, it is inconvenient to mine an expert subject distribution. For this purpose, similar to [ 3 ], an author speci label of the author. For example, supposing four subjects are considered and one subject 2 and 3, and the corresponding L (a) can be denoted as Additionally, the distribution w  X  a  X  is to represent the author  X 
Subject  X  layer. Next, each topic is chosen from the topic distribution related to this subject and each word is chosen from a word distribution related to this topic. Given in Table 1 and the formal de fi nition of the AST model are described as follows: 3.2 Parameter Estimation The AST model employs Gibbs Sampling [ 16 ] to perform inference approximation. Gibbs Sampling is a popular method for parameter estimation in the topic model. In the a subject is re fl ected by  X  . The probability that a word chooses a topic is re so they do not appear in the joint probability. At the same time, because  X  is the  X  D-separation  X  from the rest of the model given that  X  are now restrained to the labeled subjects.
 The joint probability can be formally derived in Eq. 1 : In Eq. ( 2 ), given w is observed, the conditional probability P s and P z adi j z : adi ; w ; s ; b ; d  X  X  are expected. First, P s simplicity, the hyper parameter is omitted. Now, supposing s where s adi represents the subject of token i in author a number of subject j that author a assigned to, except adi of topic k that subject j is assigned to, except adi . In addition, author  X  s  X  .
 The second conditional probability is similar to the fi rst one. Supposing z represents the number of topic k that subject j assigned to, except adi as follows: 4.1 Experiment Setup In this experiment, 500 scholars with more than fi ve subjects were randomly selected from the entire dataset. The NLPIR 4 was utilized for Chinese words segmentation and POS tagging on the abstracts. Only the noun, adjective and noun verb were used, in which the frequency of emergence is greater than or equal to noise. Finally, 623 subjects and 15,533 unique words are left. Both the AT model and the AST model were also testi fi ed for benchmark. 4.2 Evaluating AST Model 4.2.1 Results of Perplexity To evaluate the performance of the AST model, the perplexity was applied to estimate performance (lower perplexity is better). Perplexity is de metric mean of the token likelihood in the given model as follows: In this study, ten percent of words in each document were selected randomly as the testing dataset are regarded to be drawn from an independent identical distribution, so the perplexity can be determined using the testing dataset of the AST model trained on the training dataset. For simplicity, the hyper parameters were set to 50/ K , 0.01, and 0.01, respectively. For performance comparison, the per-plexity of the AT model is also estimated. The hyper parameters model were also set to 50/ K and 0.01 respectively. 1,000 iterations were conducted in each Gibbs Sampling procedure on a machine with Core i5 3.20 GHz processor. As each of the authors  X  X  Subject  X  layers of the AST model are supervised, it was not needed to be set in advance. The  X  Topic  X  layer of the AST model and AT model were set from 50 to 500.
 In Fig. 2 , the perplexity values of both models are presented. As seen from this fi gure, by increasing the number of topics, the perplexity of AST model decreases at and then converges to a relative stationary state when the topic is set to 450. Accord-means that the AST model is better as a topic model. The argument might be that the  X 
Subject  X  layer of the AST model has a high degree of con it catches the inter-similarity of documents to reduce some noises. 4.2.2 Example of Topic Discovered In this study, four subjects discovered by the AST model were presented as examples in Table 2 . The four subjects are Computer technology, Informatics, Management science and Clinical medicine. Each subject is shown with top two topics and top six words. In Table 2 , with regard to subject #358  X  Computer technology, these two topics are highly relevant, each of which describes a particular research For example, Topic #389 concerns about the model and algorithm, and Topic #222 concerns about the application of information system. Similar phenomena can be found in other three subjects. belong to a cross-fi eld domain. For example, topic #222 has a high probability in the subject of Computer technology and Management science. Topic #222 concerns the application of Information system, which is a cross-domain. Computer technology and Management science all get involved in this area. Furthermore, it is also found that subjects may consist of both speci fi c topics and cross-subject #353, topic #147 which concerns about the supply chain is one speci fi eld in Management science. Comparatively, topic #222, as mentioned above, is one cross-fi eld topic. Some similar examples can be found within other subjects. As reported from these results, the proposed AST model is found to be able to correlate topics and cluster words with a speci fi c or cross-4.2.3 An Application of the AST Model A typical application of the AST model is to recommend experts in a speci paper review of periodicals. A total of ten abstracts of papers were randomly selected from the dataset as testing data, which are built from WANFANG DATA. As men-tioned in the previous section, the NLPIR was fi rstly used to pre-process the testing abstracts. The recommending function of the recommend system is de In this function, abs denotes the input testing abstract, which contains the words wi . The probability of P(a|s), P(s|t), P(t|wi) are derived from the AST model respectively, which can be gained from a trained model. With this function, top@5, top@10 and top@20 authors are recommended as the experts. Subsequently, the recommended experts are invited for paper review of periodicals.
 In considering the recommendation of review experts of periodicals, the difference of experts are recommended whose research interests not only match the testing entire research domain of the testing abstract. To evaluate the performance on expert recommendations, the method of pooled relevance judgments [ 17 ] is often used. However, it is not applicable in this research. First, the pooled relevance judgments need manual evaluation. But the dataset in this research involves intensive interdisci-plinary studies, which need a time-consuming process to identify the research fi elds. Second, the pooled relevance judgments only lead to the evaluation on the precision. However, in this study, a group of experts are expected whose research domains are as far as possible to cover the research domains of the testing paper. Accordingly, the topic coverage and the average symmetric KL-Divergence are utilized to measure the authors  X  topic distance. The topic coverage is de percentage of topic aspects covered by reviewers [ 18 ]: N a represents the number of topics that these N authors can cover. N author were selected as the whole topics of authors, and top 100 topics of each word were selected as the whole topics of the abstracts. The result of the coverage was of a lacking of information about authors; therefore, using the topic of words is an approximate way to represent the topics of testing abstracts. Overall, an encouraging result is obtained. For example, the coverage value reaches 0.55 if only recommended and that goes up to 0.87 if 20 experts are invited. distributions. The bigger the value of KL-Divergence, the more distinguished the two experts. The function of the KL-Divergence is de fi ned as follows: expert j  X  s topic t . The comparative result of average symmetric KL-Divergence of the AT model and AST model is shown in Table 4 .
 of the AST model at top@5, top@10 and top@20 is larger than that of the AT model, which implies that each author  X  s topics in the AST model are more distinguished than those in the AT model. Since, in this research, a group of experts are recommended the proposed AST model is better than the AT model in recommending a group of AST model is larger than that of the AT model might be that the AT model only infers authors  X  topics in the documents layer, which leads to an unavoidable decrease in the KL-Divergence over topics. However, the AST model allows the supervised layer to be shared across each author and the documents can be clustered under the  X 
Subject  X  layer, which will reduce some noises and increases the KL-Divergence. In this study, a novel graph model of the Author Subject Topic model was proposed for expert recommendation. The supervised  X  Subject  X  layer is introduced in the AST model, which aims to be shared with authors and helps to cluster words and documents for noise reduction. Compared with the AT model, the AST model was proven to be a more effective topic model to model experts  X  research domains and more suitable for expert recommendation.
 As there are increasingly more metadata is available, some potential research studies are suggested to extend the AST model with factors such as a time stamp, link structure, author authority such as H-index and citation times, etc. Additionally, some further studies may also include how to determine a group of experts accurately and comprehensively, which are believed to ease the burden of expert recommendation for periodical review.
