 During specific real-world events, some users of microblog-ging platforms could provide exclusive information about those events. The identification of such prominent users depends on several factors such as the freshness and the rel-evance of their shared information. This work proposes a probabilistic model for the identification of prominent users in microblogs during specific events. The model is based on learning and classifying user behavior over time using Mix-ture of Gaussians Hidden Markov Models. A user is charac-terized by a temporal sequence of feature vectors describing his activities. The features computed at each time-stamp are designed to reflect both the on-and off-topic activities of users. To validate the efficacy of our proposed model, we have conducted experiments on data collected from Twitter during the Herault floods that have occurred in France. The achieved results show that learning the time-series of users X  actions is better than learning just those actions without temporal information.

 CIKM X 15 October 19-23, 2015, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Copyright 2015 ACM 978-1-4503-3794-6/15/10 ...$15.00 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2806416.2806612. forms are seen as the perfect ground to mine relevant and exclusive information during such events. Although these microblogs such as Twitter provide many characterizing fea-tures about their content  X  such as the number of retweets or favorites etc.  X , such features generally refer to popular users content rather than reflecting the real importance of that content. Therefore, in the context of a specific event  X  such as a disaster  X , it is more logical to associate the rel-evance and quality of messages with the user X  X  prominence in that specific event [11, 8, 15].

We define prominent user identification in microblogging platforms as identifying key users who provide fresh and rel-evant information during specific events regardless of their popularity in the platform. To the best of our knowledge, this task has never been studied in this context. However, the related problems of finding influencers have been widely explored in the state-of-the-art [10, 4]. Other works have dealt with the identification of topical authorities and do-main experts [9, 13, 6]. In these related contexts, key users were identified by analyzing either the network structure us-ing time consuming centrality algorithms such as PageRank [7, 12, 14] and HITS [1], or using the historic topical users ac-tivities independently of their temporal characteristics and off-topic activity [10, 13].

These general purpose existing approaches would give a misleading image of users behavior in real scenarios. Users are mainly evaluated according to their on-topic activity while neglecting their off-topic one. Such practice would pro-mote official media channels toggling between several top-ics and which are not necessarily sharing fresh information. Moreover, users are typically represented in terms of the quantity of their produced and forwarded information inde-pendently of the temporal distribution of this information. This would give the same description for users interacting at an early stage of the event by sharing fresh information and other users posting the same information at its end. This work is thus designed to alleviate these shortcomings. More specifically, we present the following contributions: (1) a novel representation of microblogs user behavior as a tem-poral sequence of features that characterize both the on-and off-topic user activities, (2) a probabilistic model for the identification of prominent users in microblogs during spe-cific events. This model is based on learning and classifying the mentioned representation using a Mixture of Gaussians Hidden Markov Model (MoG-HMM).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents problem formulation. Section 3 discusses our pro-posed approach of modeling user behavior. Section 4 de-scribes the used HMM learning model for classifying promi-nent users. Experimental evaluation is presented in Section 5. Finally, we conclude with directions for future work in Section 6.
We formulate the problem of prominent users identifi-cation in the context of specific events as two main sub-problems. The first is representing users so that to reflect their temporal behavior during an event. Each user u has to be represented by a temporal sequence V u = ( V 1 u ,V 2 u where m is the length of the sequence describing the user be-havior over m time stamps. V ( i ) u represents user description at each time interval i , and can be any set of features char-acterizing the user. The second sub-problem is learning to classify users X  temporal sequences of features as either be-longing to prominent c 1 or non-prominent c 2 user classes. Thus we need to learn two probabilistic models H c H 2 by training the continuous temporal sequences describ-ing each class of users. Given these models, we need to es-timate the likelihood L ( V | H c 1 ) and L ( V | H c 2 ) of each user sequence.
In order to model users consistently with their realistic behavior in microblogs during events, we propose a temporal sequence representation approach. The behavior of users is represented according to their observed on-and off-topic activities at different temporal stages during an event.
The time-line of an event is divided into equispaced in-tervals at m time stamps. During each interval, users ac-tivities are characterized by a set of features rather than a single feature as there are several types of activities in mi-croblogs. The user activity is represented by the feature vector V t i u calculated based on t 1 ,t 2 ,t 3 ,...,t m Those features  X  discussed in the next subsection  X  describe the user behavior regarding an event (on-topic activity) and also regarding other topics (off-topic activity) during each time interval. Figure 1 illustrates  X  in its upper part  X  such a user representation.

Using this user behavior modeling approach, we provide a more enriched representation of microblogs users by consid-ering both on-and off-topic user activeness levels over time. Such representation is capable of characterizing similarities and regularities of users behaviors.
We define a set of new features inspired by the features proposed by Pal et al. [9]. For each user u and each time stamp t m , we compute the following features by taking into account both the on-and off-topic user activities: Topical Attachment: indicates the involvement rate of the user regarding the analyzed event by referring to the number of his original on-topic tweets ( T 1 on ) and the num-ber of his on-topic shared links ( T 2 on ) adjusted by the off-topic metrics ( T 1 off ) and ( T 2 off ).
 Topical Influence: estimates the value (or worthiness) of the user X  X  original tweets regarding the event according to the number of favorites ( T 3 on ) and the number of retweets ( R 2 on ) of his produced tweets.
 Retweeting Rate: measures the impact of the shared event-related-tweets on the user retweeting activity. This feature adjusts the number of the user X  X  retweets ( R 1 on ) by the num-ber of unique users that he has retweeted ( R 4 on ). Retweeted Rate: calculates the impact of the original tweets produced by the user on the other users. This feature adjusts the number of users who have retweeted the user X  X  on-topic tweets ( R 3 on ) and the total number of retweets ( R 2 on ) by the corresponding off-metrics ( R 2 off ) and ( R 3 Incoming Mention Rate: measures the diversity of men-tions related to the user. This feature adjusts the number of received on-topic mentions ( M 1 on ) by the number of unique users mentioning the user ( M 2 on ).
 Outcoming Mention Rate: represents the mentioning activity of the current user by computing the number of his on-topic produced mentions ( M 3 on ) adjusted by the number of unique mentioned users ( M 4 on ).
 Centrality Degree: promotes users having more on-topic followers and followees than off-topic ones. This feature is measured by adjusting the number of on-topic followers ( G 1 on ) and followees ( G 2 on ) of each user with the number of his off-topic relations ( G 1 off ) and ( G 2 off ). Once these features are computed, each user u can be rep-resented by the following feature vector at each time stamp t .
 The set of concatenated feature vectors computed at all the time stamps represent the temporal sequence of the user behavior.
In order to classify the time-series of feature vectors V describing each microblogs user, we train two models for prominent and non-prominent users classification using MoG HMMs. There are various types of continuous HMM: left-right, parallel left-right and ergodic. To learn our MoG HMMs, we use the ergodic model as the user activity level state at a period of time t i can change to every other state at the period of time t i +1 through a single transition. Figure 1 shows a 3-state ergodic model describing how the sequence of feature vectors representing a given user can be transformed into a sequence of discrete states.
 Figure 1: A time-series representation of user activ-ities during an event using a 3-state ergodic HMM
To learn the parameters for our MoG-HMM ergodic mod-els, we use the Baum-Welch algorithm [5]. This algorithm is based on the EM algorithm to search for the maximum probability of the HMM models parameters that better fit the observed temporal users sequences in the training data. A MoG-HMM model H is described by the quadruplet H = { S, X ,A,B } , where S = S 1 ,S 2 ,S 3 ,...,S k refers to the set of k hidden states describing levels of users activities at each period of time t i . The state of a user at time t can expressed by ( X t  X  S ) 1  X  t  X  m .  X  denotes the initial probability of the different states. A is the state transition probability ma-trix to change from state S i to S j , A = a ij where a output probability matrix where the probability B = b i ( V represents the probability of observing a feature vector V from a state S i , where b i ( t ) = P ( V t | X t ) = ( S
The transformation of these feature vectors into discrete states is processed by the construction of a continuous obser-vation probability density function (PDF) matrix B . This matrix is represented as a mixture of Gaussians in order to associate the sequence of a user X  X  feature vectors into the different finite states using equation 10. where c ik is the mixture weight, N is the normal density,  X  ik is the mean vector and W ik is the covariance matrix for the k th mixture component in state S i .

Once the models parameters H c 1 and H c 2 are set through training, we can compute the probability of any microblogs user to belong to each class P ( V u | H c 1 ) and P ( V u the two learned models. These probabilities are obtained using the forward-backward algorithm [2]. If the model H gives a higher probability to a represented user compared to P ( V u | H c 2 ), then this user is classified as prominent.
To conduct experimental performance evaluation on real data, we have tracked the Twitter users who have shared at least one on-topic information about the floods that have occurred from 29 th to 30 th September 2014 in the Herault area, situated in the south of France using ou multi-agent system MASIR [3]. 3332 users have been tracked during the two days of the disaster.

To create the ground-truth, we conducted a subjective user study in order to label each user in the dataset with c1 and c2 indicating respectively whether the user is prominent or not. The tracked users were evaluated according to the relevance and exclusivity of their tweets during the disaster. According to this study, 90 users have been classified as c 1, and 3242 users have been classified as c 2.
For experimental set-up, we randomly sampled 60% of both prominent and non prominent labeled users datasets as training data for building the H c 1 and H c 2 classifiers, and the remaining 40% as test data. Features characteriz-ing user behavior were extracted sequentially at each time interval of 90 minutes from the beginning of the event to its end. Thus each user is represented by a sequence of 32 fea-ture vectors. We have also extracted features using different interval lengths.

Following the standard evaluation criteria used in the con-text of prominent users identification, we use precision, re-call and F1-score measures to evaluate the performance of our approach. In order to choose the coherent parameters for the representation of microblogs users behavior through H c 1 and H c 2 models, we have tested different values of  X  X um-ber of states X  N s (from 1 to 6) and  X  X umber of multivariate Gaussian X  N G (from 1 to 5) with the training dataset. The experimental results are shown in Table 1. The best results are obtained when N s = 3 states and N G = 1, yielding F1-score value to 64%.
 Table 1: Prominent users identification performance for different N s and N G in terms of F1-score.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our temporal sequence representation approach for the identification of prominent users, we test the performance of our model by decreas-ing the length of the feature vectors sequence m ( from 32 to 2) (e.g. m=2 users activities features are recorded at each 720 minutes). In other words, users behavior are rep-resented during longer periods of time. Figure 2 shows how the sequence length variation affects the performance of our model. According to these results, we find that larger se-quence length characterizing detailed users activities over time works significantly better than smaller ones. Thus, user behavior is better characterized with more time stamps. Figure 2: Time-series sequence length effect on the model performance
We compared our HMM temporal sequence classification model with two baseline models: Baseline 1: refers to an SVM model learned using our proposed features and a classic single vector representation of the user behavior during the event.
 Baseline 2: refers to an SVM model learned using Pal et al. features [9] and a single vector user representation.
Figure 3 shows the results of comparing the three different models, where our proposed model significantly outperforms the models which are trained on users activities in the whole event duration (i.e independently of the activity distribu-tion over time). We also note that our features are more effective in the context of prominent users identification in specific events than Pal et al. [9] features which are based on analyzing only the on-topic user activity.
This paper has presented a novel microblogs users repre-sentation according to their behavior over time in specific events. This representation has been used for building and training a MoG-HMM model to identify prominent users. In our model, users are characterized by a temporal sequence composed of feature vectors recorded in different periods of time during the event. These features characterize the on-topic and off-topic users activities at each time interval. Our experiments show that a longer length of the sequence char-acterizing the user behavior over time, produces a better identification model. We have additionally compared the performance of our model to traditional machine learning SVM models using our features and state-of-the-art features. Figure 3: Classification results using different base-line models The achieved results show the importance of learning time sequences of users activities as compared to learning those activities independently of their temporal characteristics.
For future work, we aim to predict prominent users at different event phases. We would like also to analyze the correlation between temporal activities of prominent users and the time of occurrence of the trending sub-events. [1] E. Agichtein, C. Castillo, D. Donato, A.
