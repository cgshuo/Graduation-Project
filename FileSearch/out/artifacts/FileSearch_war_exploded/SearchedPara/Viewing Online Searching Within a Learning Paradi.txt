 In this research, we investigate whether one can model online searching as a learning paradigm. We examined the searching characteristics of 41 participants engaged in 246 searching tasks. We classified the searching tasks according to Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  Taxonomy, an upda ted version of Bloom X  X  taxonomy. Anderson and Krathwohl is a six level categorization of cognitive learning. Res earch results show that Applying takes the most searching effort as measured by queries per session and specific topics searched per sessions. The categories of Remembering and Understanding , which are lower-order learning levels, exhibit searching character istics similar to the higher order categories of Evaluating and Creating . It seems that searchers rely primarily on their intern al knowledge and use searching primarily as fact checking and verification when engaged in Evaluating and Creating . Implications are that the commonly held notions of Web searchers having simple information goals may not be correct. We discuss the im plications for Web searching, including designing interfaces to s upport exploration and alternate views.
 Experimentation, Human Factors Information searchi ng, Bloom X  X  Taxonomy A widespread paradigm for anal yzing Web searching is problem solving or decision-making. Donohe w and Tipton [3, p. 251] state that information seeking research is intertwined with decision making. Much information and Web searching research is intertwined with this view of searching as a decision making process. However, there is little empirical evidence supporting the relationship between information searching and problem solving [3]. We therefore explored othe r possible paradigms in which to view Web searching, namely as a learning activity. We present a brief literature review, research questions, preliminary results, and implications for future Web searching systems. T here is information searching litera ture that refers to an on-going learning process while a person is engaged in information searching [c.f., 4] . However, there has been little research into how or even if learning explicitly manifests itself in the searching process. Bloom X  X  Taxonomy may be a method for investigating Web search as a learning pr ocess. Bloom X  X  Taxonomy is a primary classification of learning in the cognitive domain [2]. An updated version, Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  Taxonomy [1, p. 67-68], redefined Bloom X  X  original classification [1]. Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  Taxonomy is a six-tiered model for classifying learning according to cognitive levels of complexity. Our research question is: Is a learning paradigm effective for analyzing information searching? Using Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy of learning in the cognitive domain, we developed searching tasks for each of the six taxonomy X  X  categories. We then analyzed the exhibited searching characteristics to detect differences in searching behavior. We constructed searching scenarios for each level in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  Taxonomy, with each scenario correlated to one classification. The searching scenarios were pilot tested twice before we used them in a laborat ory study. The six classifications with definitions and example searching scenarios are shown in Table 1. Forty-one subjects participated in a laboratory study. Each participant engaged in six searching scenarios and were instructed to address the scenario s. Each participant had access to an individual computer with Internet access. All user interactions with the computer were logged using a non-intrusive logging software package. We analyzed participant interactions in accordance with standard characteristics of information searching using transaction log analysis as the methodological approach. We investigated whether or not there would be a significant difference in (1) the number of queries and (2) the number of topics per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  Taxonomy. A topic is the information focus of one or more queries. A searching se ssion may have several topics. Results from an ANOVA analysis indicate that there is a significant difference among the groups (F(5) = 4.175, p &lt; 0.01) in terms of queries per session. Applying was significantly different then the classifications of Remembering , Understanding , Analyzing , and Evaluating (p &lt; 0.05). Applying was not significantly different in numbe r of queries per session from Creating . Concerning topics per session, an ANOVA analysis indicate that there is a significant difference among the groups (F(5) = 6.869, p classifications of Remembering , Understanding , Creating , and Evaluating (p &lt; 0.05). Applying was not significantly different in number of topics per session than Analyzing . From these initial research results , searching as learning may be a more appropriate paradigm to analyze online searching than decision making. The implications of this study are that commonly held notions of Web searchers having simple information needs may be incorrect. These simple searching expressions may be supportive of higher-level information goals at the Evaluating and Creating levels of learning. Using this view, the goal of systems design shifts to one of not closing uncertainty too quickly but instead offering alternate points of view. We consider this an exploratory study to investigate whether learning is an appropriate paradi gm for online and Web searching. Along with further analysis of the existing data (such as session duration, systems used, etc.), we aim to conduct larger scale studies that focus on require d system design changes.
