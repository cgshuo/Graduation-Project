 Xiaopeng Bai 1  X  Nianwen Xue 1 Abstract The Chinese Proposition Bank (CPB) is a corpus annotated with semantic roles for the arguments of verbal and nominalized predicates. The semantic roles for the core arguments are defined in a predicate-specific manner. That is, a set of semantic roles, numerically identified, are defined for each sense of a predicate lemma and recorded in a valency lexicon called frame files . The predicate-specific manner in which the semantic roles are defined reduces the cognitive burden on the annotators since they only need to internalize a few roles at a time and this has contributed to the consistency in annotation. It was also a sensible approach given the contentious issue of how many semantic roles are needed if one were to adopt of set of global semantic roles that apply to all predicates. A downside of this approach, however, is that the predicate-specific roles may not be consistent across predicates, and this inconsistency has a negative impact on training automatic systems. Given the progress that has been general semantic roles. In this article, we describe our effort to  X  X  X e-annotate X  X  the CPB with a set of  X  X  X lobal X  X  semantic roles that are predicate-independent and investigate their impact on automatic semantic role labeling systems. When defining these global semantic roles, we strive to make them compatible with a recently published ISO standards on the annotation of semantic roles (ISO 24617-4:2014 SemAF-SR) while taking the linguistic characteristics of the Chinese language into account. We show that in spite of the much larger number of global semantic roles, the accuracy of an off-the-shelf semantic role labeling system retrained on the data re-annotated with global semantic roles is comparable to that trained on the data set with the original predicate-specific semantic roles. We also argue that the re-annotated data set, together with the original data, provides the user with more flexibility when using the corpus. Keywords Semantic role Predicate-argument structure Chinese Proposition Bank Semantic role labeling The Chinese Proposition Bank (CPB) (Xue and Palmer 2009 ) is a corpus annotated with semantic roles for the arguments of verbal and nominal predicative expressions. It is built on top of the Chinese TreeBank (Xue et al. 2005 ), a syntactically annotated Chinese corpus that is word-segmented, POS-tagged and syntactically bracketed with phrase structures. The latest version of the Chinese Propbank, CPB 3.0, has 1.2 million words (1.9 million Chinese characters) of Chinese text from a variety of sources ranging from Xinhua Newswire, Sinorama Magazine articles, transcriptions of broadcast news and broadcast conversations, to weblogs. All verbs in the Chinese Proposition Bank are annotated, along with some of the nominalized predicates. The availability of the Chinese Proposition Bank enabled the development of machine learning based automatic Chinese semantic role labeling systems trained on the CPB (Xue 2008 ; Ding and Chang 2008 ; Che et al. 2009 ; Li et al. 2009 , 2010 ; Sun et al. 2009 ; Sun 2010 ), in much the same way similar resources for English text such as the English Proposition Bank (Palmer et al. 2005 ) and FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998 ) enabled the development of a long list of semantic role labelers (Xue and Palmer 2004 ; Pradhan et al. 2004 , 2005 ; Toutanova et al. 2005 ; Koomen et al. 2005 ).
A semantic role represents the relation between a predicate and one of its arguments. There are different ways of defining semantic roles. The CPB, following the English Proposition Bank, defines the semantic roles for the core arguments in a predicate-specific manner. The core arguments are arguments without which the meaning of a predicate is incomplete. As such, core arguments are considered to be  X  X  X bligatory X  X . 1 Core arguments are also more specific to a given predicate in the sense that they are  X  X  X elected X  X  by the predicate. For example, a source or goal role would be very natural for  X  X  X hange of location X  X  verbs, but odd for verbs like  X  X  X at X  X . The third property of core arguments is that they are assumed to be unique. That is, multiple arguments are not expected to play the same role. 2 In contrast with core arguments, secondary or adjunctive arguments are considered to be optional and not tied to a specific predicate. For example, arguments that indicate location or time are often associated with many different kinds of events. The CPB, like the English Proposition Bank, defines two different types of semantic roles reflecting this distinction between core and adjunctive arguments. The core arguments are defined on a per-predicate basis implemented in the form of frame files . In a frame file, different senses called framesets for a predicate are first defined. Then for each sense, the set of core arguments for this sense and their semantic roles are defined. The core arguments are numbered and a predicate typically has 1 X 5 core arguments. The senses are coarse-grained and are mainly motivated by the fact that different senses have different sets of core arguments. The definitions of these senses do not necessarily take into account subtle meaning differences attributed to sources other than the types of arguments a predicate takes. A description of the full set of frame files can be found in (Xue 2006 ), and the frame file for the verb  X  X  /deposit X  X  is given in Table 1 .

Given the predicate-specific approach in defining semantic roles, a frame file is needed for each predicate, and the full set of frame files can be viewed as a valency lexicon that is used to guide the annotation of predicate-argument structures in running text. Due to the lack of morphological variations in Chinese, a verb and its nominalization are identical morphologically and they do not have separate frame files. There are several engineering advantages for adopting a predicate-specific approach to the annotation of predicate-argument structures. From the point of view of defining semantic roles, defining semantic roles on a per-predicate basis avoids the contentious issue of determining how many semantic roles are needed for a language (or for all languages) a priori , and this makes the task of defining semantic roles tractable for developers of frame files. From an annotation point of view, semantic roles defined on a per-predicate basis reduce the cognitive load on the annotators who do not have to internalize all the semantic roles for a language and familiarize themselves with the sometimes fine distinctions between the different semantic roles. This leads to consistency in the annotated data as evidenced in the high inter-annotator agreement statistics in Propbank style of annotation (Palmer et al. 2005 ; Xue and Palmer 2009 ), which in turn leads to their wide adoption in training statistical semantic role labeling systems (Xue and Palmer 2005 ; Xue 2008 ; Ding and Chang 2008 ; Che et al. 2009 ; Li et al. 2009 , 2010 ; Sun et al. 2009 ; Sun 2010 ).

Propbank style predicate-specific semantic roles are not without their shortcom-ings, however. Although the semantic roles are consistently applied to all instances of the same predicate in a corpus during annotation, there is no guarantee that the definition of a semantic role is consistent across different predicates, or even across different senses of the same predicate, although in practice frame file developers are fairly consistent with the definitions of ARG0 and ARG1 . For example, for the different framesets of  X  X  /deposit X  X  in Table 1 , ARG2 of Frameset 1 refers to the financial institution, which is a location, but ARG2 of Frameset 3 is  X  X  X nstrument X  X . Such cross-predicate inconsistency is both linguistically unsatisfying and problematic for purposes of training automatic semantic role labelers. On the other hand, a large body of data annotated with predicate-specific semantic roles lays the empirical foundation for starting to emerge (Kipper-Schuler 2005 ; Baker et al. 1998 ; Petukhova and Bunt 2008 ), and an ISO standard on the annotation of semantic roles for English has been just published (ISO 24617-4:2014 3 ).

In this article, we describe our effort to  X  X  X e-annotate X  X  the Chinese Propbank with a set of global semantic roles (or  X  X  X SRL X  X ). We take advantage of the fact that all instances of the same predicate in the Chinese Propbank are consistently annotated with predicate-specific semantic role labels by simply adding a mapping between predicate-specific semantic roles (or  X  X  X SRL X  X ) and GSRLs in the frame files. The GSRLs can then be automatically propagated down to the individual predicate instances in the corpus. This allows us to avoid the need to re-examine each predicate instance in the corpus, which would have been the most time-consuming aspect of the  X  X  X e-annotation X  X  task. An example mapping is provided in Table 2 . There are complications, however, with this approach, which we will discuss in Sect. 4 .
The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 , we review related work and discuss alternative ways to define semantic roles that are consistent across predicates. In Sect. 3 , we describe how we define the set of global semantic roles. We also discuss some complications in the mapping between GSRLs and existing predicate-specific roles. The mapping of predicate-specific roles changes the distribution of the different semantic roles in the corpus and has implications for automatic semantic role labeling. In Sect. 5 , we investigate the impact of the resulting corpus on automatic semantic role labeling. We show that despite the dramatically enlarged set of semantic roles, the difference in performance of the semantic role models trained on the corpora before and after the re-annotation is negligible. Delving deeper into the accuracy of specific semantic roles, we show the performance of a subset of the semantic roles has improved while that of the others has degraded, consistent with findings from similar work on English semantic role labeling (Loper et al. 2007 ). In Sect. 6 , we conclude our work. In order to map the predicate-specific semantic roles for the core arguments in the CPB to a set of global semantic roles that apply to all predicates, the first step is to define a set of finite set of global semantic roles. In this section, we review several representative approaches in defining semantic roles. Specifically, we will review how semantic roles are defined in the FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998 ), the VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler 2005 ), and LIRICS (Petukhova et al. 2007 ; Petukhova and Bunt 2008 ). In all these cases, the semantic roles are defined at a level that abstracts away from individual predicates. However, they differ on the level of abstraction.
FrameNet defines semantic roles on a per-frame basis. The semantic roles are called Frame Element (FE) in FrameNet terminologies and they are defined with reference to a Semantic Frame (SF) . A SF describes a type of event or relation where FEs are participants of the frame. The center of a SF is a set of Lexical Units (LU) , which are predicative linguistic units that evoke this SF. For example, (1a) and (1b) are instantiations of FN  X  X  X tatement X  X  frame: (1) a. [They Speaker ] told [me Addressee ] that she likes Dan.  X  X  X old X  X  and  X  X  X aid X  X  belong to the set of LUs associated with  X  X  X tatement X  frame and share two FEs  X  X  X peaker X  X  and  X  X  X ddressee X  X .  X  X  X peaker X  X  in both (1a) and (1b) represents the participant who gives out information and  X  X  X ddressee X  X  represents the participant to which the information is delivered. All lexical units associated with this semantic frame share the same FEs and effectively form a class. In the case above,  X  X  X old X  X  and  X  X  X aid X  X  could be considered to belong to one semantic class. In FrameNet annotation, actual text spans that represent arguments in a sentence are labeled with FE labels.

In contrast, VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler 2005 ) defines semantic roles in the context of defining verb classes based on Levin alternations. The semantic roles as well as their syntactic realizations are used to define a hierarchical classification of English verbs. As a result, some of the semantic roles have a level of specificity that are suitable for certain verb classes but not for others. For example, Topic is a role that is specific to verbs that indicate transfer of information, as in (2). It is constrained by features ? information content and ? abstract . The Topic role share the basic features with theme , but differs from theme in these two specific features that are associated with this class of verbs. Compared with FrameNet, the verbs in a VerbNet verb class are not as semantically coherent as the Lexical Units in a FrameNet Frame, as the former also consider syntactic regularities when defining the verb classes. (2) [John Agent ] informed [me Recipient ] of [the situation Topic ].

The semantic roles in LIRICS (Petukhova et al. 2007 ; Petukhova and Bunt 2008 ) are defined in a way that avoids making explicit references to verb classes and syntactic regularities as VerbNet does. Semantic roles are conceived as relational notions that link participants to an event, and describing the way the participant is involved in an event. The way of involvement is described in terms of whether a participant acts intentionally or not, whether the participant is affected, changed or manipulated by other participants of the event, and whether the participant comes into existence as a result of the event. For example, an Agent is defined as a  X  X  X articipant in an event who intentionally or consciously initiates an event, and who exists independently of the event X  X , and a Patient is defined as a  X  X  X articipant in an event that undergoes a change of state, location or condition, is causally involved or directly affected by other participants, and exists independently of the event X  X . Nevertheless, there is substantial overlap between the semantic roles in VerbNet and those in LIRICS. After all, most of the semantic roles used in VerbNet are not specific to one verb class. Conversely, even though the LIRICS roles are defined without explicit reference to verb classes, it is not the case that all semantic roles are equally likely in all verb classes. In other words, using the semantic roles that a verb is associated with in LIRICS, one can still infer some verb classification.
Each flavor of semantic roles described above are based on different tradeoffs, but for the purpose of mapping the predicate-specific semantic roles for core arguments to global semantic roles that abstract away from individual predicates, they can all be used to achieve some degree of cross-predicate consistency. In fact, there has been previous work on mapping the semantic roles in the English PropBank to those of VerbNet, creating a semantically linked resource that effectively generalizes the semantic roles in the PropBank (Loper et al. 2007 ). The work we report here is in the same vein. Given that we do not have a existing lexical resource like VerbNet for Chinese, we first need to define a set of global semantic roles. Since creating a lexical resource like the FrameNet Frames or VerbNet classes is currently out of reach given the scope of our work, we essentially adopt the approach of LIRICS and define the semantic roles based on a limited set of semantic properties. We will describe these semantic roles in detail in the next section. For the most part, these semantic roles will be very similar to those in LIRICS or VerbNet.

As far as we know, there is relatively little work in Chinese that is similar to the work we describe here. The work that is most similar to ours is perhaps the Chinese Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese (SKCC) (Wang 2003 ). SKCC is a Chinese valency lexicon consisting of not only verbs and nouns but also adjectives, adverbs and numerals, which are considered to be predicates that have valency. The relationship between a predicate and its arguments is described in deep syntactic terms such as subject and object . For example, the Chinese verb  X  X   X  X  has two subject and an object. In addition, the arguments for each sense of a predicate are sense of , the subject is  X  X  /human being X  X , and the object is  X  X  /things X  X . In contrast, for the  X  X  X efund X  X  sense of , the subject is still  X  X  /human being X  X , but the object is  X  X  /money X  X . Since subject and object are deep syntactic notions rather than semantic notions, they are not necessarily consistent across predicates. In this respect, they are not very different from the predicate-specific roles in the Chinese Proposition Bank. The semantic attributes for the arguments of a predicate are similar to those provided in the VerbNet, and are out of scope in the work we describe here. In this section, we first lay down some general criteria for defining a set of global semantic roles for Chinese. We then present these GSRLs and their definitions, followed by a comparison of our global semantic roles with those of LIRICS. 3.1 Criteria for defining semantic roles A predicate is the center of an event (for our purposes an event could be either an action or a state) and arguments are participants of the event. A predicate and its arguments together form the eventuality frame of an event. A semantic role represents the relationship between a predicate and one of its arguments. The nature of this relationship is sometimes affected by other arguments of the predicate as well. When we define the semantic roles, we take into account the following factors:
Mode of involvement is the manner in which an argument participates in an event. Some arguments (e.g., Agent , Cause ) are initiators of an event. Other arguments (e.g., Patient , Theme , Endurer ) undergo the effects of an event. Still other arguments stay in the background and do not participate directly in any phase of an event (e.g., Setting , Reason , Location , and Time . There are also arguments that describe specific phases of an event, or the status of an argument at a given point (e.g., Origin , Destination , Source , and Startstatus ).
Dependence on event is whether the presence of a given argument is semantically dependent on the action or change of state/condition associated with the predicate in an event. Some arguments, like the initiator of an event, are independent of predicate in that they exist no matter the event happens or not. Other arguments, by contrast, are dependent on the predicate. For example, a Product comes into existence as a result of the action denoted by the event.
Changeability in event is whether a given argument changes during the course of an event. Some roles are affected by actions in an event, like Patient . Others are not, like Location , Time , and Reason .
 Additionally, we also take into account semantic attributes (e.g., physical/non-physical, sentient/non-sentient) of the participant to fine-tune the semantic roles. The semantic attributes or features that factor into how we define semantic roles are limited and only used when we think they are important. Based on these primitive criteria, we define 23 global semantic roles (GSRLs), which we describe in detail below:
Agent is the intentional initiator of an event that pre-exists the event. (3) In (3),  X  X  /he X  X  is an agent that intentionally initiates the action  X  X  /collect X  X . An Agent differs from a cause in that the former refers to a sentient living creature like human beings, organizations, or animals.

Amount refers to the quantity, duration, distance and limitation of an event. For example, in (4),  X  X  /five years X  X  is the duration when the agent has been away from home. (4)
Beneficiary is the participant that is indirectly affected when an action is performed. A  X  X  X eneficiary X  X  just receives some impact/benefit from the happening of an event rather than actively participating in the event. Syntactically, the indirectly affected participant typically follows a preposition while the directly affected participant is usually the patient syntactically typically realized as the direct object. (5) In 5, the direct participants of predicate  X  X  /buy X  X  are  X  X  /I X  X  and  X  X  /a gift X  X .  X  X  /boy X  X  is outside the procedure of  X  X  /buy X  X . He might be the one receiving the gift or I bought the gift for someone else on behalf of the boy. Either way,  X  X  /boy X  X  is benefited from the happening of  X  X  /buy X  X .

Causer is the unintentional initiator of an event and it pre-exists the event. It is similar to Agent except that it initiates the event unintentionally.  X  X  /tornado X  X  in (6) denotes a natural phenomenon which cannot be intentional, so it is Cause . (6)
Destination is the temporal or spatial end point of an action or process. It pre-exists the event. The Destination role is conceptually associated with the Origin role, but a given predicate does not have to encode both roles. For example, in (7),  X  X  /Beijing X  X  assumes the Destination role to the predicate  X  X  /move here X  X . We must have moved to Beijing from somewhere, but the origin does not have to be specified. (7)
Origin is the temporal or spatial starting point of an action or process. Origin is conceptually symmetrical to Destination , but in many cases Origin can be realized without Destination and vice versa. (8) In (8),  X  X  /Beijing X  X  is the starting point of the action  X  X  /move here X  X . Although the Destination role is not explicitly realized in the sentence, we can identify  X  X  / Beijing X  X  as Origin because  X  X  /we X  X  are now somewhere else at the utterance time.
Pivot Most semantic roles are defined in relation to a predicate representing an action or event. Other predicates represent a state, condition, or relation between arguments. For such predicates, the most prominent participant are neither initiators like Agent or Cause , nor undergoers like Patient or Theme . Such predicates include copula verbs like  X  X  /be X  X , verbs of possession like  X  X  /own X  X , comparison verbs like  X  X  /greater than X  X , and inclusion verbs like  X  X  /contain X  X . (9)
Startstatus is the starting point of a participant X  X  status before it is engaged in the action or event. Startstatus pre-exists the event and changes to Endstatus after the action or event. In (10),  X  X  /severe illness X  X  is the initial health state of the par-ticipant  X  X  /he X  X : (10) Endstatus is the end point of a participant X  X  status through the action of an event. Endstatus is associated with Startstatus but the two do not have to be explicitly realized syntactically at the same time. One or the other can be implied. (11) Sentence (11) describes a city that becomes ruins due to a big fire.  X  X  /ruins X  X  is  X  X  X ndStatus X  X  of  X  X  /city X  X  because it comes into existence as a result of the event  X  X  /change into X  X .

Instrument is the participant that another participant (usually Agent ) manipu-lates to perform an action. Instrument pre-exists the event. (12) Location is a participant where an event takes place, or a status or thing exists. Location pre-exists the event or status. (13) The Location argument  X  X  /heart X  X  is a core argument to  X  X  /stay X  X  and it is essential to the completeness of the event. Location as a core argument is necessary only location that applies to almost all events.

Manner represents the manner in which one performs an action, or undergoes a change of state. Manner is involved in the entire duration of an event. The boundary between Manner and Instrument can sometimes be unclear, but in general, Instrument does not have to be involved during the entire event, but Manner does. In (14),  X  X  /with left hand X  X  expresses a manner in which writing is performed. (14)
Patient is a participant undergoing physical change or experiencing physical impact of an action or an event. Patient is a dependent role that requires a Cause or Agent that initiates the action. This is illustrated by  X  X  /cup X  X  in (15), and it is impacted by the event  X  X  /break X  X  initiated by  X  X  /I X  X : (15) Purpose is an argument that represents the goal of performing an event or action. The state or condition that Purpose represents does not exist before the event, and does not necessarily come into existence through the event. (16)
In (16), there are three participants in the event of  X  X  /order X  X : the Agent who gives the order (  X  X  /policeman X  X ), the Patient who receives the order ( X  X  thief X  X ), and the purpose of the order ( X  X  /stand still X  X ). The thief may or may not obey the order and stand still.

Reason is an argument that provides the explanation or the cause for the occurrence of an event. It usually represents something that motivates another participant to initiate an event. Reason pre-exists the event, and is an independent role that is not affected by the event.

Example: (17)
There are two participants in the eventuality frame of  X  X  /regret X  X  represented in (17):  X  X  /he X  X  and  X  X  /wrong X  X . Wrong things were done before the person regrets about it, then the person has regrets because of the wrong things he has done.
Recipient is a participant representing the end point of a transfer event. Recipient pre-exists the event, and is dependent on other participants of an event. A participant is transferred to the Recipient after the event. (18) In (18),  X  X  /he X  X  passes  X  X  /this /information X  X  to  X  X  /supervisor X  X  by initi-ating the  X  X  /report X  X  event.  X  X  /supervisor X  X  is the end point of  X  X  /this / information X  X  which is transferred to him by  X  X  /he X  X . Therefore  X  X  /supervisor X  X  is the Recipient .
 Result is a participant that becomes available to another participant (usually Recipient ) upon the completion of an action/event. Result pre-exists an event, and its status or condition is subject to change during the event. (19)
In (19),  X  X  /the information X  X  exists before the  X  X  /report X  X  event. It is not available to  X  X  /supervisor X  X  before the event and  X  X  /supervisor X  X  has learned about it at the end of the  X  X  /report X  X  event.

Product is a participant that comes into existence upon the completion of an action/event. (20) In (20), the Product  X  X  /ten thousand /CL /vehicle X  X  comes into existence after the event  X  X  /produce X  X .
 Setting is an argument providing the background to the occurrence of an event. Setting pre-exists an event and and cannot be changed by the event. (21) The subject  X  X  /high school /English /teaching X  X  of (21) is not the initiator of the  X  X  /focus on X  X  event, and there is an unrealized initiator (English teachers) for the event.  X  X  /high school /English /teaching X  X  is the domain in which the event occurred and is the setting of the event.
 Both Setting and Reason pre-exist the event and are independent of an event, but Reason provides the direction motivation or explanation for the occurrence of the event while Setting does not.

Source represents a participant that is the original form of another participant, status. It is an alternative form of existence. In (22),  X  X  /a /novel X  X  assumes the Source role for the predicate  X  X  /adapt X  X . (22)
Target is a participant that undergoes no changes in an event/action. Such event/ action is mostly associated with verbs of emotion or psychological act. In (23),  X  X  /miss X  X  is a psychological act that does not bring about any change to the Target  X  X  /hometown X  X . (23)
Theme is a participant that undergoes non-physical changes in an event in terms of its status, emotion, condition or location. (24) a. In (24a), the employment status of  X  X  /me X  X  has changed as the result of the action  X  X  /fire X  X . In (24b), the location where  X  X  /cargo X  X  is stored has changed as the result of the action  X  X  /unload X  X .

Since undergoing non-physical changes is critical for identifying the Theme role, arguments denoting abstract concepts can only be assigned the Theme role: (25)
The sentence in (25) states that  X  X  /fund X  X  is frozen by the bank, thus the availability status of  X  X  /fund X  X  has changed through the action  X  X  /freeze X  X . Time represents the time when an event occurs, or a condition and status holds. Time pre-exists of an event.

There is a ARGM-TMP for adjunctive arguments, but it is not essential to the lexical meaning of a predicate. (26) 3.2 Comparison with LIRICS roles The semantic roles defined in the LIRICS Project are listed as one of the reference semantic role sets for the ISO standard on semantic annotation ISO 24617-4:2014. Our GSRL roles overlap to a large extent with the LIRICS roles but there are also some differences. As we have discussed in previous sections, semantic roles are defined primarily in terms of the semantic relation between a predicate and its argument, but in practice, reference is sometimes also made to the semantic type of an argument or even to its syntactic realization. While the semantic relations between a predicate and its arguments are presumed to be language-independent, the semantic roles can vary depending on the specific semantic types that factor into how semantic roles are defined.
 For example, Amount , Distance and Duration are separate roles in LIRICS. Duration is the length or extent of time, and Distance is the length or extent of space. Amount , Distance or Duration are different in the lexical meanings of the arguments they are used to label, but they are not different in how these arguments relate to their predicate. So instead of having three different roles, we combine them into one Amount role. Our rationale is that if Distance , Duration and amount are different roles, we might also need separate roles for weight, amount of money, and altitude, etc. Medium is another LIRICS role that we do not define. It is described as a  X  X  X articipant that represents the physical setting, entity or channel used by an agent (or agents) in an event or process X  X , as in (27): (27) The students [heard predicate ] the news on [the radio Medium ].

Our sense is that it is hard to separate Medium from Instrument or Manner to make it a separate role.

We also collapsed some LIRICS roles because it is difficult to separate them due to the lack of morpho-syntactic clues in Chinese. For example, the Path role in LIRICS indicates a path connecting two locations. In English a Path argument is usually realized as a prepositional phrase introduced by a small number of prepositions such as  X  X  X cross X  X  and X  X  X hrough X  X  that signals path, but there is a lack of such unambiguous syntactic clues in Chinese either because the prepositions are dropped in some context or because the function of the preposition is incorporated to the verbal predicate itself (28). This makes it hard to distinguish Path from Location . So we merged the two. (28)
Another such example is the Partner role in LIRICS, which represents the participant that is intentionally involved in carrying out an event but not the principal agent. In English, Partner is easy to identify because it is usually realized as a prepositional phrase with a preposition like  X  X  X ith X  X . The Chinese equivalent  X  X  /and X  X  or  X  X  /and X  X  are ambiguous between a preposition and a coordinating conjunction and it less important one. We therefore merge the Partner role with with Agent , Causer or Pivot . As a result, for a given predicate, it is possible to multiple Agents .
Table 3 shows the mapping of CPB GSRLs and LIRICS roles. There are 24,536 frame files for verbal, adjectival and nominal predicates in the Chinese Proposition Bank. A verb and its nominalization share one predicate since there is no morphological variation between them. Some of the predicates are polysemous and there are 26,716 framesets, which are coarse-grained senses defined based on differences in the argument structure of the predicates, for the 24,536 frame files. We manually added a global semantic role for each predicate-specific role for each frameset. We have shown a sample mapping between PSRLs and GSRLs in Table 2 , and another example is provided in Table 4 .

In most cases, the mapping between PSRLs and GSRLs is one-to-one and fairly 4.1 One-to-many mappings Some of the predicate-specific seman tic roles are ambiguous when mapped to GSRLs. For example, ARG0 of  X  X  /burn-destroy X  X  is defined as the agent or cause of the burning event. In a specific instance of the  X  X  /burn-destroy X  X  in naturally occurring text, ARG0 will either be one or another but never both, since there are in complementary distribution and only one of them can occur. This is shown in (29). In (29a), ARG0 of  X  X  /burn-destroy X  X  ,  X  X  /angry people X  X  should be mapped to Agent . In (29b), however, ARG0 of  X  X  /burn-destroy X  X  is  X  X  /big fire X  X  should be mapped to Cause . At the predicate-level in a frame file, however, it is impossible to disambiguate between the two GSRLs. In this case, we map ARG0 to both, and will perform predicate instance level disambiguation in the future. Altogether there are 1071 CPB framesets (4% of all framesents) that have a PSRL that map to more than one GSRL. ARG0 that maps to either Causer or Agent is a very typical scenario (Table 5 ). (29) a.
There are 1107 framesets with a total of 1177 cases in which a PSRL is mapped to more than one GSRL. Table 6 shows the ambiguous semantic role types and the number of their occurrences. 4.2 Mapping arguments of atypical predicates or atypical framesets When mapping the PSRLs to GSRLs, we found that some verbs have usages that do not function like a predicate taking some arguments. Rather they have aspectual or modal meanings, or are passive markers. Some of these verbs are polysemous, meaning they are not dedicated aspectual or modal verbs, or passive voice markers. They can be used as true for them when they are used as aspectual or modal verbs, or as passive voice markers. For example,  X  X  /ask X  X  can be used as a modal verb or a true predicate, as shown in (30). In framesets where it is used as a true predicate, its PSRLs will be mapped to GSRLs. On the other hand, when it is used as a modal verb, we do not define semantic roles for it (30b). (30) a.
We also do not define semantic roles for predicates or senses of a predicate that are used as a passive voice marker. For example, in (31),  X  X  /get X  X  is a passive voice marker, although syntactically it is the main verb of the sentence. The true predicate is the eventive noun,  X  X  /punishment X  X , which takes two arguments. The agent is not explicitly realized and the patient is  X  X  /conspirator X  X . (31)
Similarly, in (32),  X  X  /get X  X  is also a passive voice marker and the true predicate is the eventide noun  X  X  /verify X  X . (32)
In (33), the main verb  X  X   X  X  takes an eventive noun  X  X  /monitor X  X  as its object, and the eventive noun is the true predicate while the main verb is an aspectual verb that indicates that the event is in progress. (33)
The difficulty in identifying these passive voice markers, modal and aspectual verbs in Chinese is due to the fact that they are not fully grammaticalized. Unlike the English are not different syntactically from typical transitive verbs. This becomes clear only when we attempt to define their semantic roles. Some of these non-predicative uses are assigned PSRLs in the CPB frame files, and we did not map these to GSRLs.
Using the PSRL to GSRL mappings in the frame files, we automatically  X  X  X e-annotated X  X  all the instances in CPB 3.0, which is based on the Penn ChineseTreebank 7.0. It has 2448 articles (790 newswire articles, 58 magazine articles, 1207 broadcast news transcripts, 86 broadcast conversations, and 13 web logs). There are 173,206 predicate instances, among which 154,567 of them are  X  X  X e-annotated X  X  with new GSRL labels and they cover 89.2% of all instances. The uncovered instances are caused by improperly defined frame files in which the PSRLs cannot be mapped to GSRLs and we leave them for future inspection. In this section, we explore the impact of replacing PSRLs with GSRLs. We first present a mapping between GSRLs and PSRLs and show that this mapping is many-to-many rather than one-to-many. We also demonstrate that the association between syntactic structures and semantic roles has changed, thereby changing the utility of the syntactic structures as a source of information for predicting the semantic roles. Finally, we present evaluation results that show the automatic semantic role labeling performance using GSRLs is comparable to that using PSRLs. 5.1 Mappings between GSRLs and PSRLs Creating a mapping between PSRLs and GSRLs adds another layer of semantic role annotation to the CPB. This makes it possible to fairly compare the automatic SRL performance using the two types of semantic role labels. The use of GSRLs impacts automatic SRL performance in several ways. On the one hand, the tag set has increased dramatically, from 5 to 21. The common wisdom is that as the tag set increases, the automatic SRL task will be harder and the accuracy of automatic SRL will be lower. On the other hand, the GSRLs are more consistent across predicates. This is especially true for arguments that are labeled PSRLs ARG2 and ARG3 , the definition of which tend to vary from predicate to predicate. Having consistent data is generally considered to be conducive to automatic semantic role labeling and to machine learning approaches in general.

Table 7 shows the mappings between PSRLs and GSRLs calculated for all frame files in CPB. The number in each cell indicates the percentage of GSRLs mapped to each PSRL. We can see that the mapping between the PSRLs and GSRLs is not  X  X  X ne to N X  X . Rather it is  X  X  X  to N X  X . 5.2 Syntactic distribution of the semantic roles Syntactic structures are crucial to automatic semantic role labeling in several ways. First, state-of-the-art systems rely on syntactic structures as input and the constituents in a syntactic parse tree are used as the candidates for classification (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002 ; Pradhan et al. 2004 ; Xue and Palmer 2004 ), although there is also work that performs semantic role labeling on text chunks (Hacioglu et al. 2004 ; Roth and Yih 2005 ; Aziz et al. 2011 ). Second, syntactic structures are relied on in pruning algorithms that remove constituents that are irrelevant to a particular predicate in the argument identification step (Xue and Palmer 2004 ). Finally, syntactic structures are an important source of information that can be encoded as features (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002 ; Pradhan et al. 2004 ; Xue and Palmer 2004 ). Replacing the PSRLs with GSRLs not only changes the distribution of the semantic roles themselves but also the association between the semantic roles and syntactic positions of the arguments. As a result, it changes the utility of the syntactic structure as a source of information that can be used to predict the semantic roles in a statistical machine learning framework. Tables 8 and 9 show the correspondence between syntactic positions and PSRLs and GSRLs respectively. We use a subset of the function tags in the Chinese TreeBank (Xue et al. 2005 )to represent syntactic positions.

There are 7 function tags in the Chinese Treebank that indicate a particular position in a parse tree: IO , OBJ , EXT , FOC , PRD , SBJ , TPC .

From Table 8 , it is clear that there is a strong association between PSRLs and syntactic positions. Over 90% of the time, a subject ( SBJ )isan ARG0 , and almost 93% of the time, an object ( OBJ )is ARG1 . There is a fairly strong association between indirect object (IO) and ARG2 as well. In contrast, the association between syntactic positions and GSRLs is much weaker. From Table 9 we can see that only 53.5% of the time the subject is an Agent , and 26% of the time an object is a Target . We expect the weaker association negatively impact the automatic semantic role labeling performance. This is also reflected in the difference in the conditional entropy values of the PSRLs and GSRLs given the syntactic positions: the conditional entropy of the PSRLs given the syntactic position is 0.95, while the conditional entropy of the GSRLs given the syntactic positions is 1.95. The larger value of the latter suggests that it is more difficult to predict the GSRLs than the PSRLs based on their syntactic positions. The formula on the conditional entropy is: where x is semantic role label and y is syntactic node label. 5.3 Comparative automatic SRL results Since the distribution of GSRLs in the corpus is quite different from that of PSRLs, it affects all aspects of a machine learning based system. Loper et al. ( 2007 ) has shown by mapping the predicate-specific semantic roles in the English PropBank to the global semantic roles in VerbNet, the performance of their SRL system has improved for arguments labeled Arg2 and Arg3 because the global semantic roles are more consistent across predicates. On the other hand, the larger role set for GSRLs may lead to data fragmentation and exacerbate the data sparsity problem, and ultimately lead to less accurate automatic SRL systems. With the same data set annotated with two sets of semantic role labels, it is fairly straightforward to set up experiments to compare the automatic role labeling accuracy on both sets of labels. We present results on overall system performance as well as the performance of individual semantic roles. 5.3.1 Experiment configuration We retrained an off-the-shelf semantic role labeler (Xue 2008 ) on the same data set with two sets of semantic role labels. The semantic role labeler is based on a Maximum Entropy classifier with a tunable Gaussian Prior in the Mallet Toolkit. 4 We use the same features described in (Xue 2008 ), which are tailored to the PSRLs in the original CPB data set. The 2448 CPB 3.0 files are split into a training set (contains 2083 files), development set (160 files) and test set (205 files) by articles There are 154,567 predicate instances in training set and 7233 instances in test set. The semantic role labeler takes as input a constituent parse tree and a given predicate, and performs automatic semantic role labeling in three steps. In the first step, a heuristic pruning algorithm is used to filter out constituents that are not related to the predicate. The pruning is done in a way that maximizes the recall so that many constituents that are not arguments to the predicate are still left in. In the second step, a binary classifier is trained to further separate arguments from non-arguments of a predicate. In the third and final step, a multi-category classifier is trained to assign a semantic role label to each of the arguments predicted by the binary classifier in the second step. It is worth mentioning that although we define 21 GSRL labels, there actually are 36 labels in the experiment because some PSRLs are mapped to more than one GSRLs. 5.3.2 Automatic SRL performance The automatic semantic role labeling results are presented in Table 10 . In this experiment setting, we use manually annotated parse trees from the Chinese TreeBank as input for purposes of the pruning algorithms as well as feature extraction. We can see that the F-score for GSRL labels is slightly (1.1 %) lower than that for the PSRLs. Considering that the GSRL tag set is much larger than the PSRL tag set, and that the features of the semantic labeling model is tailored to PSRLs without any adaptation for the GSRLs, the results are surprisingly close. Given that we are using an Maximum Entropy based model, our hypothesis is that although the conditional entropy of the GSRLs given the syntactic positions has increased, the conditional entropy of GSRLs given other features must have decreased to offset the less effective syntactic features.

To delve a little deeper, we compare the SRL results for individual roles using the two sets of semantic roles. The results of the original PSRLs and the mapped GSRLs, sorted by the original PSRLs, are presented in Table 11 .
We can see that when mapped to GSRLs, the accuracy of Arg0 and Arg1 dropped by by 2.8 and 3.1 % respectively, while there is a significant improvement in accuracy for Arg2 and Arg4 . One plausible explanation is that the improvement is due to increased consistency in ARG2 and ARG4 . The improved consistency allows us to learn better models. On the other hand, the drop in accuracy of ARG0 and ARG1 can be explained by the fact that ARG0 and ARG1 are closely associated with their syntactic positions, as shown in Table 8 . After the mapping, this strong association is weakened, as shown in Table 9 . This weakened association renders the syntactic features of the semantic role labeling model less effective, which explains the lower accuracy for ARG0 and ARG1 . Our findings are consistent with the results reported in (Loper et al. 2007 ) for a similar effort on the English PropBank, although in that work, they only reported improved results for ARG2 , ARG3 , but not for ARG0 and ARG1 .
 We also repeated the experiments using the syntactic parses generated by the Berkeley Parser (Petrov and Klein 2007 ) 5 as input to our semantic role labeling system. The results are presented in Table 12 . The results show that there is considerable degradation in SRL performance, which is expected, because when using automatic syntactic parses, there are be errors in the POS tags of the words as well as the syntactic structures. These errors will propagate to the SRL model in both the feature extraction process and the predicate identification phase. What is important for our purposes is that the difference in performances between GSRLs and PSRLs using automatic parses is comparable to the difference between the two systems when using manually annotated parses: the difference is within one percentage point. In this article, we present our efforts to generalize the semantic roles in the Chinese Proposition Bank. The motivation for this effort is that the semantic roles in the CPB are defined in a predicate-specific manner and are sometimes inconsistent across predicates. We first present a set of global semantic roles (GSRLs) and the criteria used in defining them. We then add a mapping between the predicate-specific semantic roles (PSRLs) and the GSRLs in the frame files that are used to guide CPB annotation. Using this mapping, we are able to automatically  X  X  X e-annotate X  X  the CPB data by propagating the GSRLs to the specific predicate instances. Finally, we investigate the impact of the GSRLs on automatic semantic role labeling accuracy. We show that despite the fact that the set of GSRLs is significantly larger, the automatic SRL accuracy is comparable to that when using the PSRLs. The GSRL-labeled CPB provides an extra layer of consistent semantic relation information that enhances the utility of the CPB. Together with PSRLs in the original CPB, the enhanced CPB broadens the way that the corpus can be used. References
