Voice -Rate is an automated dialog system d e-signed to help consumers while they are shop ping . The target user is a consumer who is considering making an impulse purchas e and would like to get more inf ormation. He or she can take out a cell -phone, call Voice -Rate , and get rating infor mation to help decide whether to buy the item. Here are three sample scenarios: Voice -Rate solves the fuzzy -matching process by treating spoken queries as well as business and product names as docu ments, and then performing TF -IDF based lookup. F or a review of name matching me thods, see e.g. Co hen et al., 2003 . In the ideal case, after a user asks for a particular product or business, the best -matching item as measured by TF -IDF would be the one intended by the user. In reality, of course, this is often not the case, and further dialog is necessary to determine the user X  X  intent. For concreteness, we will ill u-strate the disambiguation process in the context of product identification.
 When a user calls Voice -Rate and asks for a pro d-u ct review, the system solicits the user for the product name, does TF -IDF lookup, and presents the highest -scoring mat ch for user confirmation. If the user does not accept the r etrieved item, Voice -Rate initiates a disambiguation dialog. Aside from inade quate product coverage, which cannot be fixed at runtime, there are two possible sources for error: automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors, and TF -IDF lookup errors. The di s-am biguation process begins by eliminating the first. To do this, it asks the us er if his or her exact words were the recognized text, and if not to repeat the request. This loop iterates twice, and if the u s-er X  X  exact words still have not been ident i fied , Voice -Rate apologizes an d hangs up.
 Once the user X  X  exact words have been validated, Voice -Rate gets a positive identification on the product category. From the set of high -scoring TF -IDF items, a list of possible categories is compiled. For example, for  X  X he Lord of the Rings The Two Towers , X  there are items in Video Games, DVDs, Music, VHS, Software, Books, Websites, and Toys and Games. These categories are read to the user, who is asked to select one. All the close -matching product names in the selected category are then read to the user, until one is selected or the list is exhausted. To our knowledge, Voice -Rate is the first large scale ratings dialog system. However, the techno l-ogy behind it is closely related to previous dialog sys tems, especially directory assistance or  X 411 X
