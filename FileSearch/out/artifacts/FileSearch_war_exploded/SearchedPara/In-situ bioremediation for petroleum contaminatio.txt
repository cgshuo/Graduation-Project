 1. Introduction
Groundwater is one of the most vital sources of drinking water on earth. However, in the past few decades, this major water resource has been threatened by many anthropogenic organic compounds that have been introduced due to human activities. It was estimated by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) that about 98% of underground storage tanks (USTs) are used to store petroleum hydrocarbons, and more than 80% of those tanks have leakage problems. The presence of these anthropogenic organic compounds in groundwater aquifers is a serious health hazard. In order to clean up petroleum-contaminated groundwater aquifers, several physical, chemical and biological technologies have been developed within the past few decades. Among these remediation technologies, in-situ bioremediation, which involves stimulating the indigenous microbes in the groundwater aquifer to degrade the petroleum contaminants in place, is often integrated with other remediation technologies to achieve the most cost-effective results at an organic contaminated site.

In the implementation of in-situ bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated aquifers, the major dif fi culties appear to be related to the delivery of appropriate electron acceptors (e.g. oxygen), the bioavailability of substrate (e.g. hydrocarbon), and the presence and expression of appropriate microbial cata-bolic capabilities. The process of in-situ bioremediation involves complex and uncertain relationships among biomass, contami-nant, nutrients and appropriate control actions. For the affected communities, industries, and governments, it is critical that the petroleum contamination be cleaned up with sound environ-mental and economic ef fi ciencies. To achieve this objective, the automatically controlled in-situ bioremediation process system is a key technology.

This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 gives a statement of the problem. Section 3 presents design of the fuzzy rule-based model predictive control system, which includes the control algorithm and development of the core system compo-nents. Section 4 discusses a case study that illustrates the system functions, and Section 5 presents the conclusion and some directions for future work. 2. Background on the problem
The process of in-situ bioremediation encourages growth and reproduction of indigenous micro-organisms to enhance biode-gradation of organic constituents in the saturated zone. In-situ bioremediation involves a mechanism for stimulating and main-taining the activity of intrinsic bioemediation processes, through which indigenous microbes convert contaminants to innocuous end products via electron acceptor and/or inorganic nutrient amendments ( US EPA, 2004 ). This technology can effectively degrade the full range of petroleum hydrocarbons, which are dissolved in groundwater and adsorbed into the aquifer matrix. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical in-situ bioremediation system. In such a system, groundwater is extracted using extraction wells and if necessary, treated to remove residual dissolved constituents. The treated groundwater is then mixed with electron acceptor and nutrients, and re-injected into upstream or midstream of the contaminated source through injection wells. The normal opera-tion of the system includes monitoring and control of the extrac-tion/injection fl ow rates, concentration of the groundwater elec-tron acceptor (usually oxygen), nutrient (usually nitrite) levels, pH, and conductivity, etc.

The interactions among the system components of the in-situ bioremediation process are dif fi cult to understand and it is practically impossible to accurately predict potential reactions in the contami-nated subsurface. In real life fi eld work, human operators accumulate knowledge and experience on ho w best to control the in-situ bioremediation process at a speci fi c site over time, and they deter-mine detailed steps involved in control actions such as when to perform groundwater injection, what is the optimal injection rate, and the amounts of oxygen and nutrient additives that should be administered. The knowledge that operators have acquired can be obtained and incorporated into a knowledge based system. In Hu et al. (2003) , a fuzzy expert system based in-situ bioremediation process control system (FESCS) has been presented. The control system of
FESCS can search the rule base and adjust the system operation at each monitored control period based on the monitored site situation and operation goal. This approach recommends the best local control actions at each control period by identifying and executing the appropriaterulethatresidesintheknowledgebaseofthesystem, and the fuzzy rules were developed based on knowledge acquired from domain experts. However, the weakness of this approach is that it considers the best control action for individual control periods but ignores the total operation cost for the entire control duration. As a consequence, the control system does not suggest a cost-effective control action sequence from a global perspective.

Many numerical simulation models for subsurface contami-nant transport and degradation have been developed; some examples include UTCHEM ( University of Texas at Austin, 2000a, 2000b ), HSSM ( US EPA, 1995a, 1995b ), NAPL Simulator ( US EPA, 1997 )andBIOPLUMEIII( US EPA, 1998 ). Qin et al. (2009) presented a comprehensive review of the simulation techniques for the fl ow and transport of petroleum contaminants in the subsurface. Generally, seeking an optimal control strategy for the in-situ remediation process is challenging because of the combination of a nonlinear numerical simulation model with complex objective functions ( Yan and Minsker, 2006 ). Some relevant studies such as Culver and Shoemaker (1992) , Huang and Mayer (1997) , McKinney and Lin (1996) , Rizzo and
Dougherty (1996) , Chang et al. (2007) and Chu and Chang (2009) have demonstrated that coupli ng optimization and simula-tion techniques can assist in selecting a cost-effective control strategy for the in-situ bioremediation system. The developed optimization methods include numerical exact/inexact pro-gramming, multi-objective programming, dynamic program-ming and arti fi cial intelligence-aided programming. However, the control strategy often involves control action selection rules, which are almost impossible to simulate using only speci fi functions. Often the approach adopted is to solve the con-strained and nonlinear objective functions and numerical simu-lation models involved by calculating the optimization problem through assigning random numbers and repeated trial and error.
When the search space involved in the model is large, the solution process can be computat ionally intensive and demand-ing in terms of the time needed. As a consequence, the systems that adopt this approach can only be off-line systems. Rao et al. (2003) , Bayer and Finkel (2004) ,and Huang et al. (2008) indicated that the combination of arti fi cial intelligence technol-ogy and numerical simulation model is effective for improving the control ef fi ciency and reducing the computational complex-ity of the control system. Some online control systems were developed in Hu et al. (2006, 2007) . These systems are based on a hybrid approach that combines numerical simulation and multiple objective optimization, and the solution method adopted involves genetic algorithms or GA, which can offer signi fi cant advantages in its ability in searching for a solution in a large state space. But due to the complex computation involved in generating the solutions, these systems cannot operate in real-time. In Huang et al. (2008) , the theoretical framework of an integrated control system was proposed to improve performance of the remediation control system, which involves a combination of numerical model, stepwise cluster analysis, optimization and arti fi cial neural networks.
Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most compelling advanced process control algorithms in recently years. MPC has been widely used in industry as an effective means to resolve multivariable constrained control problems. Camacho and Bordons (1998) and Lee (2011) present the reviews of the theory and applications of MPC as well as its development in the last three decades. Gr X ne and Pannek (2011) illustrate the theory and algorithms of the nonlinear MPC. The principle of MPC relies on a forecast of the future behavior of a system at each sampling instant based on the process model. For the target system whose state is measured at discrete time instants, at each time instant if the difference between the actual and predicted current states approximates the predicted state. On the other hand, if the current state approximates the reference or predicted state, then it will be kept as is.
At all the later time instants, this procedure will be repeated with the new measurements. Much research has been conducted to improve the solvability, stability and quality of MPC theory, which include and Matko (2001) , Suchomski and Kowalczuk (2002) , Findeisen et al. (2003) , Exadaktylos and Taylor (2010) , Reble et al. (2011) ,etc.The applicability of industrial MPC was successfully veri fi ed in various industrial domains, and the works include Saez et al. (2005) , Feng and Fuentes (2011) ; Minh and Rashid (2012) ,etc.
 Fuzzy logic was proposed in 1965 by Lot fi A. Zadeh (1965) .
Since then fuzzy logic has emerged as a powerful technique used in control of industrial processes and in expert systems. Fuzzy logic systems tackle the imprecision of the input and output variables by de fi ning fuzzy numbers and fuzzy sets that can be expressed in linguistic variables. A fuzzy rule-based system can be a rule-based fuzzy logic controller that consists of a set of fuzzy rules, which are linguistic If-Then statements with the general form of  X  If A Then B  X  . The use of linguistic fuzzy if-then rules exploits the tolerance for imprecision and uncertainty of expert experience. Fuzzy rule based systems have been used widely and successfully for process control of various industrial processes, and the work has been reported in Tsoi and Gao (1999) , El-Shal and Morris (2000) , Klepiszewski and Schmitt (2002) ,and Sun et al. (2007) .

In this study, we propose a hybrid fuzzy rule-based model predictive control system (FMPCS), which integrates the advan-tages of a fuzzy expert system and a numerical simulation model.
Compared to the hybrid approach used in systems presented in Hu et al. (2003, 2006, 2007) , which combines simulation and optimi-zation, the FMPCS has the advantages of (i) being computational less complex, (ii) making use of existing domain knowledge and experiences to improve the control quality, (iii) handling unpre-dictable conditions, and (iv) demonstrating better reliability and fault-tolerance. The FMPCS improves upon the earlier approaches in that it can: (i) generate a cost-effective solution for automated control of the in-situ bioremediation process, and (ii) operate as an online and real-time process control system. Details on the design of the FMPCS are presented in the next section. 3. Design of the hybrid fuzzy rule-based model predictive control system (FMPCS) 3.1. Control algorithm
The hybrid fuzzy rule-based model predictive control system developed in this study is a customized model predictive control system, which involves a fuzzy rule-based expert system and an optimization function for decision making, and a fuzzy numerical simulation model to predict future site status directed by a recommended control strategy. Compared to traditional MPC, this customized system only resolves the optimal control problem and generates new control strategy sequence when it is necessary, hence, it is computationally less complex than the traditional MPC approach.

The fl owchart that represents the algorithm of the FMPCS is shown in Fig. 2 and it is described in detail as follows.
First, the control system reads the states of the target system such as the hydrologic characteristics of the contaminated site, the contaminants' concentration and the background concentrations of oxygen and nitrite at the present time, when t  X  0. Secondly, this set of data is saved in the database and sent to the calculate-optimal-state-sequence (COSS) function. This function predicts the state sequence which includes the contaminants' concentrations from the next time interval, when t  X  1, to the predicted system shutdown time, and the recommended optimal control action sequence from the present time, when t  X  0, to the predicted system shutdown time.

At each time interval, the control system sends the recom-mended control action to the execution system.

At the next sampled time period, the system obtains or reads the updated parameters of the new state of the contaminated site and compares the updated values of the parameters with those of the corresponding pre-calculated optimal state. If these two sets of values fall within some prede fi ned ranges of values, the system will read the new control action from the predicted optimal control sequence and send it to the execution system. However, sometimes unpredictable events can occur; for example, heavy rainfall can affect the groundwater fl ow or more and different contaminants can seep into the site. Then, the predicted values will fall outside of the acceptable ranges of values. As a conse-quence, the existing control action sequence is discarded and a new optimal control action sequence and its corresponding set of states about the site will be recalculated with the COSS function based on the updated state parameters of the site. This procedure is repeated for each sampled time period.

A set of values for the site states are generated with each calculation of the COSS function. The graph of these values represents the feasible optimal state of the system given available cost and state information up to that time period. This graph is dynamically regenerated at the subsequent time interval when information on the states of the new site is available.
The basic task in this procedure is performed by the COSS function, which will be presented in Section 3.2 . 3.2. Calculate-optimal-state-sequence (COSS) function
The algorithm of the COSS function is as follows: 1. Let k  X  0. 2. Read site state vector at time t  X  k  X  t , which is the initial or present time. 3. Recommend alternative control actions based on the site state vector using control-action-selection (CAS) function. 4. k  X  k  X  1. 5. Predict t  X  k  X  t time site state vector for each recommended control action using simulator function. 6. Verify the validity of the recommended control action. 7. Repeat steps 2  X  6 until the predicted site state vector at time t  X  k  X  t meet the user's requirement. For a different control action sequence, the k value will be different. 8. Calculate and compare the total cost for each recommended control action sequence using the function total-cost (TC); the control action sequence with the minimal total cost will be considered as the optimal control action sequence for site state vector at time t , the predicted site state vector corresponding to this control action sequence will be marked as the optimal state sequence of the site.

There are three basic independent functions in the COSS: simulator, CAS, and TC. Simulator is a numerical simulation model which is used to predict the site state vector at the next control period under a particular control action and site condition. CAS is a fuzzy rule-based expert system which can recommend alternative control action(s) based on the input data. TC is a numerical function which can calculate the overall operation cost of each alternative control strategy. The following subsections will present the development of simulator, CAS and TC in detail. 3.3. Simulator: fuzzy numerical simulation of contaminated subsurface
The simulator function is used to simulate the elimination and transport process of the petroleum contaminants in the subsurface.
A well developed simulator UTCHEM (University of Texas at Austin, 2000) was adopted in this study as the simulation model. UTCHEM can be described as  X  a 3D, multicomponent, multiphase, composi-tional model of chemical fl ooding processes which accounts for complex phase behavior, chemical and physical transformations and heterogeneous porous media properties, and uses advanced concepts in high-order numerical accuracy and dispersion control and vector and parallel processing  X  ( University of Texas at Austin, 2000a, 2000b ). For the detailed technical documentation and user guide of UTCHEM, see University of Texas at Austin (2000a, 2000b) .
Since the simulation model is one of the most important factors in the design of a remediation strategy for a contaminated site, its accuracy directly affects the quality of decision making. However, uncertainty is inherent and unavoidable in some of the input parameters of the simulation. Larue (1997) indicated that the uncertainty inherent in hydrogeological modeling could originate from both randomness and vagueness of the input parametric values. Due to the inadequacy of the sampled data and uncertainty in the assumption of aquifer properties, heterogeneity at the site cannot be adequately and deterministically characterized. To handle this, fuzzy set theory ( Zou and Lung, 2000; Schulz et al., 1999 ), probability analysis ( Hu et al., 2002; Naff et al., 1998 ) and stochastic analysis ( Zhu and Sykes, 2000; Freeze et al., 1990 )have been adopted.
 unmeasured grid of the aquifer using UTCHEM, the fuzzy set theory was adopted for modeling the uncertain and imprecise information involved and the triangular function was used for constructing the fuzzy membership function of the uncertain parameters, which in this study are simpli fi ed to be hydraulic conductivity and porosity. Fig. 3 includes a sketch map of the locations of measured and unmeasured points in Fig. 3 (a); and the upper-bound, lower-bound values and the membership function of the unmeasured point in Fig. 3 (b). In Fig. 3 (a), Ax 0
B  X  x 1 ; y 1  X  are the locations of the sampling points while M  X  x the location of the estimated input grid between these two sampling points. The triangular fuzzy membership function of the parameters of hydraulic conductivity and porosity at each estimated input grid was constructed based on the assumptions that: (1) the soil type distribution is gradually changing along one direction and remains constant along another axis, and (2) when the concerned parameter value at the estimated grid is equal to the weighted average value of the adjacent measured points, the membership value is equal to 1. In Fig. 3 (b), P  X  A  X  and P  X  B  X  are the values of the concerned hydraulic parameter at sampling points A and B , P  X  M  X  is the value of the same parameter at the estimated input grid M with the membership value equals to 1. P  X  M  X  can be calculated by the weighted function as follows:
PM  X  X  X  PA  X  X  x x 0 x on the  X  -level cut concept and interval analysis, was used to solve this fuzzy input simulation model. The solution process of this fuzzy simulation methodology is depicted in Fig. 4 , and the vertex algorithm is described in detail as follows:
R , and denote an element of A i by x i , i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; x 1 ; x 2 ; ... ; x n are related to a real number y by the mapping of which corresponds to the fuzzy numbers A i in x i can be obtained by the following steps: 1 Discretize the range of membership [0,1] into a fi nite number of values which can be called:  X  1 ;  X  2 ; ... ;  X  m . The re in discretization depends on the degree of accuracy in approximation; 2 For each membership value  X  j , fi nd the corresponding intervals for A i in x i , i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; n . These are the supports of the
A ; A 2 ; ... ; A n . Denote the end points of these intervals by  X  a 1 ; b 1 ;  X  a 2 ; b 2 ; ... ;  X  a n ; b n . 3 Taking one end point from each of the intervals, the end points can be combined into an n -ary array. There are 2 n distinct permutations, giving 2 n combinations for the vector  X  x 1 x 2 ; ... ; x n  X  . tions and obtain 2 n values for y . Denote these by  X  y 1
The desired interval for y is given by  X  min k y k ; max k points de fi ne the support of the  X  j -cut of B . 5 Repeat the process for other  X  -cuts to obtain additional of B , and the solution to the fuzzy number B . 3.4. Control-action-selection function
The choice of system control action is critical in ensuring the smooth operation of the biodegradation process of the subsurface petroleum contamination. Since the relationship between the state parameters of the contaminated site and the control action is complex, uncertain, and nonlinear, the selection of the proper control action is dif fi cult and requires substantial expertise on both the bioremediation technologies and the hydrological conditions of the contaminated site. This dif fi cult selection task can be supported by developing a fuzzy rule-based expert system, in which the expertise needed for the task has been represented as fuzzy If-Then rules.
Knowledge engineering for constructing the expert decision support system involves three stages: (i) knowledge acquisition (KA), (ii) conceptual design, and (iii) system implementation. In the KA phase, the knowledge on objects and control processes was clari fi ed and speci fi ed using a survey questionnaire. In the con-ceptual design stage, the acquired knowledge was formalized and represented with decision trees, fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy mem-bership functions. Fuzzy linguistic parameters were adopted for describing the various considerations involved in control and in representing the states of the contaminated site. For detail on development of the fuzzy rules, see Hu et al. (2003) . The If-Then control rules were constructed in the format as follows:
If SSI A is A i with  X  iA  X  A 1 and SSI B is B i with  X  iB SSI
N is N i with
Then the selected-control-action-item 1  X  SCAI 1  X  is CAI iK  X  0 ; when SSI K r LB iK or SSI K Z UB iK ; represent the parameters on hydraulic conductivity of the site, groundwater fl ow rate, pH, soil structure and contaminat concentration, etc.

CAI 1 is a control-action-item. In order to keep the hydraulic balance of the subsurface, the injection and extraction pumping rates are assumed to be the same. In this fuzzy If-Then rule, the pumping rate is the control-action-item, and it is represented by linguistic values. The control action can specify the pumping rate, and the amounts of oxygen and nutrient additions can be calculated based on the recommended pumping rate and the background conditions of the contaminated site  X   X  N K  X  A ; B ; ... ; N
K 1 is the weight of SSI k , represents the importance of SSI selection of CAI 1 ,  X  N K  X  A  X  K 1  X  1, mn iK ,LB iK and UB of the mean, lower bound and upper bound of the iK section.
For a particular input site state vector, the SCAI 1 is the CAI with the maximum  X  i .

The input vector on the states of the site, which is predicted by the simulator function, has a set of fuzzy membership values. The -level cut concept has been used here for selection of the control action. For each particular  X  -level cut value of the input fuzzy membership function, both end points of the corresponding interval will be used to select an appropriate control action. Based on this method, the system can recommend many control action sequences for one set of input data; some of them may be the same sequence or may be an empty or void sequence. After removing the void control actions, the total-cost or TC function compares the total cost of all the alternative action sequences and identi fi es the most cost-effective one. This becomes the system recommendation. 3.5. Total-cost (TC) function
The total operation cost can be considered as the sum of the operation cost at each control period, it can be calculated as follows: JL  X  X  X   X  K where, J  X  L  X  is the total cost of a control action sequence L , l of the control sequence L during management period k , G l independent cost of control actions, such as labor cost or main-tenance expenses for the equipment, it will be a constant during the entire cleanup duration, K is the total number of control periods during the entire cleanup duration.

For each control period k , the cost G k l k  X  X  will be a function of the amount of water extracted and re-injected, and amounts of oxygen and nutrients supplied. The hypothetical cost function is assumed as follows:
G  X  X  X   X  where, u ik is the pumping rate of well i in control period k (m 3 a is the constant cost coef fi cient related to pumping rate, i  X  {1,2, ... } is the set of extraction and injection wells, Cn are the amounts of nutrient and electron accepter additions of well i in the control period k (kg/m 3 injection water), N and E are the unit costs of the selected nutrient addition N and electron addition E ($/kg).

These equations will be used to calculate the overall cost for each alternative control action sequence. 4. Case study
The control algorithm of FMPCS was tested with a set of data drawn from the contaminated site presented in Hu et al. (2003) ;a brief description of the site follows. The study site had been contaminated by spilled gasoline from a perforated underground storage tank during the early 1980s to mid 1990s. The seepage leaked into the soil and fi nally to the groundwater. The initial mean concentrations of contaminants are: benzene 0.61 mg/L, toluene 4.82 mg/L, ethylbenzene 2.32 mg/L, xylenes 1.65 mg/L.
The cleanup objective for this site is: benzene 5  X  g/L, toluene 900  X  g/L, ethylbenzene 300  X  g/L, xylenes 220  X  g/L. Some basic characteristics of the site are: the thickness of the aquifer is 2.2  X  3 m; the groundwater table is predominately located within a silty-sand soil layer; the depth of groundwater below the ground surface is 2.2 2.8 m; the plume size is 1900 m 2 ; the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0.02 to 0.04 cm/s; the average conduc-tivity is approximately 0.033 cm/s in the entire plume zone; the groundwater fl ow rate is approximately 4.56 4.62 m/year; the background dissolved oxygen concentration is 0 2 mg/L; the background nitrogen level is between 1 and 3 mg/L; the pH of the groundwater falls between 5 and 8; the targeted cleanup period is 8 months. Fig. 5 shows the estimated initial contaminant distribution of the contaminated groundwater in the plume zone.
The estimation was made based on the limited sampled data taken from the monitoring wells. Also indicated on the fi gure are the locations of the monitoring wells (called SPA and SPB), which were used for monitoring and estimating the distributions of BTEX in the contaminated groundwater, and extraction and injection wells, which were used for extracting and reinjecting groundwater during the remediation processes.

Fig. 6 shows the soil type distribution of the monitored contaminated zone. The entire contaminated area was discretized into four gridblocks vertically. Fig. 7 shows the estimated initial concentration distribution of benzene at different depths of the contaminated groundwater. This benzene distribution was esti-mated based on the limited sampled data taken during the site investigation. Due to the size of the contaminated site and the limited number of sampling points, it was impossible to obtain suf fi cient sampled data that covered the entire site. Hence, for most locations where no sampled data was available, assumptions were adopted and simpli fi cations were made using the sampled data from the site. Since estimation of the input data involved substantial uncertainty, fuzzy membership functions were used to model the uncertain parameters. As mentioned in Section 3.3 , for each location where no sampled data was available, the triangular fuzzy membership functions were used. In the design of the membership function, when the membership value is 1, the parameter value is determined by interpolating the parameter values of the two adjacent sampled points. These sampled points have the membership value of 0, and the interval between them is the tolerance level.
 study site using a monitoring interval of once every 2 weeks.
Table 1 consists of three lists of control action sequences: (i) scenario I lists the optimal control action sequence suggested by the FMPCS during the entire monitoring period from March 26 to August 25, (ii) in the middle column, the control action sequence of the actual or real control action sequence generated by the fuzzy expert system based in-situ bioremediation process control system (FESCS) presented in Hu et al. (2003) , and (iii) the predicted control action sequence generated by FMPCS, which is called scenario II.

The values of the pumping rates, and oxygen and nitrogen addition rates for different scenarios are listed in Table 1 , and the linguistic values of the pumping rate can be defuzzi fi ed into numerical values of the water fl ow rates listed in Table 2 . For the study site, the fuzzy control rules and the values listed in Table 2 are determined according to the domain expert's opinions, which are explained in detail in Hu et al. (2003) . Even though the same fuzzy rules are adopted in FESCS and FMPCS, the recommended control strategies are different for the two systems from the start time. In FMPCS, the calculate-optimal-state-sequence (COSS) func-tion was designed to generate the global optimal control strategy for the entire cleanup period, in contrast to the local optimal one recommended by FESCS. The recommended oxygen and nitrogen addition rates are derived from the function of the input site characteristics, background oxygen and nitrogen concentrations, the concentrations of the current and predicted contaminants, and the recommended pumping rates. More information about the numerical functions can be found in Hu et al. (2003) .
To calculate the overall operational costs of the control strategy recommended by FMPCS, the numerical values of the pumping rates of the entire cleanup period were used as inputs for the TC function (Eq. (2) )in Section 3.5 . The calculated results indicated that the control action strategy recommended by FMPCS (shown as scenario I in Table 1 ) could achieve a lower overall operation cost of 24% less than the overall cost of the control action sequence generated by FESCS. At the same time, compared to the FESCS, the
FMPCS achieved a lower mean concentration of benzene at the end of the cleanup time. Therefore, it can be concluded that FMPCS produces a more cost-effective control action sequence compared to that generated by FESCS.
 The mean concentrations of benzene that resulted from the
FMPCS predicted control action sequence and the actual control action sequence generated by FESCS are shown as the dotted line with circles and the solid line with circles respectively in Fig. 8 .Itcan be seen that with the implementation of different control strategies, the changes in the benzene concentration are different. The FMPCS resulted in a more signi fi cant decrease of the benzene concentration compared to the FESCS as it can be seen the graph of the predicted benzene concentration in scenario I, generated with the FMPCS (shown by the dotted line with circles) is lower than the actual or real benzene concentration generated by the FESCS (shown by the solid line with circles) for the entire clean up duration.
Scenario II is designed to test the fl exibility of FMPSC to adapt to changes in the site conditions. In scenario II, it is assumed that on May 27, the difference of the monitored and predicted states of the contaminated site exceeds the prede-termined tolerance level. The real site data on May 27 was used here as the current site states. A new control action sequence was recalculated. The new control strategy from May 27 to August 25 is also listed in Table 1 , under scenario II in the three right-hand columns. The new predicted benzene con-centration from May 27 to the end of the monitored period is shown in Fig. 6 as the lighter colored dotted line with circles.
The control strategy of scenario II (May 27 to August 25) is similar to the actual control actions applied on the site. It can be seen that the nutrient and oxygen addition amounts are slightly less than those added by the actual or real control actions during the same periods, but the newly predicted benzene concentration is still lower than that of the actual control action sequence during the same control period. The slightly lower benzene concentration for scenario II (seen in the lighter colored graph) can be explained by possibly inadequate assumptions adopted in the simulation model. For example, even though some studies (e.g. Troy and Jerger, 1993 ) suggested that temperature has a signi fi cant in fl uence on the rate of remediation, the temperature's effect on the microbial activity is not considered in the simulation model developed in this study. To enhance effectiveness of the control system, it is necessary to conduct further study on how assumptions and simpli fi cations of the inputs to the simulation model can affect site conditions and the rate of remediation. 5. Conclusions and future work bioremediation process control system has been described in this paper. This control system can identify the control action sequence and its corresponding trajectory of process actions, which can minimize the objective function of the total operation cost. By combining the fuzzy rule-based expert system with the numerical simulation model, the major advantages of FMPSC over the other developed systems presented in Hu et al. (2003, 2006, 2007) are shown. It can be seen that the FMPCS system can achieve on-line, real-time, cost-effective, and optimized control of the in-situ bioremediation process for the entire cleanup duration. The strength of this control system is its ability to handle in real-time the inherent imprecision of the bioremediation simulation model and the uncertainty implicit in the fuzzy control rules developed based on the survey questionnaire.
 model in the model predictive system is the key determinant of the effectiveness of the control system. Adopting a different set of assumptions and a different simpli fi cation strategy will signi cantly affect the accuracy of the simulation model. To improve this control system and enhance its general applicability for other petroleum contaminated sites, future work that focuses on ver-i fi cation and modi fi cation of the simulation model and its assump-tions is needed.
