 The World Wide Web and other textual databases pro vide a con venient platform for exchanging opinions. Man y documents, such as revie ws and blogs, are written with the purpose of con veying a particular opinion or sentiment. Other documents may not be written with the purpose of con veying an opinion, but nevertheless the y contain one. Opinions, or sentiments, may be considered in several ways, the simplest of which is varying from positi ve opinion, through neutral, to negative opinion. Most of the research in information retrie val has focused on predicting the topic of a document, or its rele vance with respect to a query . Predicting the document' s sentiment would allo w matching the sentiment, as well as the topic, with the user' s interests. It would also assist in document sum-marization and visualization. Sentiment prediction was rst formulated as a binary classication problem to answer questions such as:  X What is the revie w's polarity , positi ve or negative? X  Pang et al. [1] demonstrated the dif culties in sentiment prediction using solely the empirical rules (a subset of adjecti ves), which moti vates the use of statistical learning techniques. The task was then rened to allo w multiple sentiment levels, facilitating the use of standard text cate gorization techniques [2]. Ho we ver, sentiment prediction is dif ferent from traditional text cate gorization: (1) in contrast to the cate gorical nature of topics, sentiments are ordinal variables; (2) several contradicting opinions might co-e xist, which interact with each other to produce the global document sentiment; (3) conte xt plays a vital role in determining the sentiment. Indeed, sentiment prediction is a much harder task than topic classication tasks such as Reuters or WebKB and current models achie ve lower accurac y. Rather than using a bag of words multiclass classier , we model the sequential o w of sentiment throughout the document using a sequential conditional model. Furthermore, we treat the sentiment labels as ordinal variables by enforcing monotonicity constraints on the model' s parameters. Pre vious research on sentiment prediction has generally focused on predicting the sentiment of the
