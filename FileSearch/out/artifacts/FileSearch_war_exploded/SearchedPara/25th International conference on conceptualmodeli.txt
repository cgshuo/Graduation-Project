The papers in this issue of Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering (DKE) are extended versions of four of the best papers presented at the 25th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER 2006). Each paper is interesting and informative in its own right, and together, they demonstrate the breadth and depth of current research in conceptual modeling.

Conceptual modeling has long been recognized as the primary means to enable software production in information systems and data engineering. Nowadays, conceptual modeling has become fundamental to any domain in which technologists have to cope with complex, real-world systems. Conceptual modeling fos-ters communication between technology experts and technology users, and it has become a key mechanism for understanding and representing computing systems and environments of all kinds.
 As the conceptual-modeling conference celebrated its 25th-year, silver anniversary in the warm sunshine of Tucson, Arizona, it remains the premiere forum for presenting and discussing current research and applica-tions in which the major emphasis is on conceptual modeling. The papers chosen for this issue of DKE are indicative of the current work of this community.

In their paper,  X  X  X valuating Quality of Conceptual Modelling Scripts Based on User Perceptions, X  X  A. Maes and G. Poels show how to evaluate the quality of conceptual-modeling scripts. These scripts document the common understanding that stakeholders have about the information system being built.

In their paper,  X  X  X econciling Requirement-Driven Data Warehouses with Data Sources via Multidimen-sional Normal Forms, X  X  J.-N. Mazo  X  n, J. Trujillo, and J. Lechtenbo  X  rger propose a hybrid approach to the development of data warehouses. In the hybrid approach, designers first obtain the conceptual multidimen-sional model of the data warehouse and then ensure its correctness against data sources by using a set of Query/View/Transformation relations based on multidimensional normal forms.
 In their paper,  X  X  X eaving Temporal and Reliability Aspects into a Schema Tapestry X  X  C. Dyreson, R.T. Snodgrass, F. Currim, S. Currim, and S. Joshi explain how to model cross-cutting (aspect-oriented-program-ming-like) data concerns. As examples, they show how to weave reliability and temporal aspects together with a schema for the data into a single, unified schema that guides the construction, interpretation, and validation of an aspect-enhanced data collection.

In their paper,  X  X  X uerying Through a User Interface X  X  J.F. Terwilliger, L.M.L. Delcambre, and J. Logan assert that the semantics of data can often be understood by viewing the data in the context of the user-inter-face tool for data entry. They explain how to use a forms-based user interface to generate a conceptual model that represents the information in the user interface and then how to generate a query interface from the gen-erated conceptual model.
