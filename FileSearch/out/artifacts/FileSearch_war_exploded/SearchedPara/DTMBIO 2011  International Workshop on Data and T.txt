 ACM Fifth International Workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics (DTMBIO 11) organizers are pleased to announce that the fifth DTMBIO will be held in conjunction with CIKM, one of the largest data and text mining conferences. While CIKM presents the state-of-the-art research in informatics with the primary focus on data and text mining, the main focus of DTMBIO is on biomedical inform atics. DTMBIO delegates will bring forth interesting applicati ons of up-to-date informatics in the context of biomedical research.
 J.3 [ Life and Medical Sciences ]: Medical information systems Algorithms, Management, Performance, Design, Experimentation, Security. tightly coupled with developmen ts within several fields in computer science, including data mining, information retrieval, and database manageme nt systems, among ot hers. A fundamental topic of research within medical informatics is how to make effective use of the treme ndous amount of biological and biomedical data to improve the understanding of biological systems. Such data include, but are not limited to, gene and protein sequences, gene expression profiles from Microarray experiments, protein structur e predictions resulting from high-throughput computational methods, protein-protein interactions from proteomic studies, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms profiles from SNP arrays, and mu ch bibliographic information from electronic medical journals. The need to automatically and effectively extract, understand, integrate, and make use of information embedded in such he terogeneous unstructured data drives the current research in bioinformatics. world. The selection process wa s highly competitive. Each paper went through a rigorous double-blinded peer review by at least 3 members of the Program Committee. Based on the referee reports, the papers have been ranked according to their original contribution, and the program committee accepted 7 full papers and 4 short papers that cover a variety of topics, including novel information extraction techniques, ontologies, and application to large biomedical data. In additi on, the program includes a keynote speech by Dr. Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann on semantic interoperability between literature and data. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuab le reference for researchers and developers who are interested in applying Text Mining to Medical Informatics. mining techniques for the research problems in medical informatics. [1] presents a fa st approximation PCA to process brain imaging movies of Drosi phila. The method is innovative, and uses prior knowledge in selec ting sample pixels versus Monte Carlo sampling to achieve better approximation and higher speedups. [2] describes a novel application of data mining techniques to a database of patient data from a hearing aid clinic. The data consist of audiograms, data about the patient and notes in text form provided by technici ans. The goal of the experiment was to find information about what determines the prescription of two types of hearing aids: worn behind the ear and worn in the ear. [3] describes a novel search e ngine for biomedical concepts such as genes, proteins, diseases , and drugs. What is unique with this system is that it uses a "s egment" as the unit for indexing the concepts, so that the user can specify the context of a query at a much more fine-grained level than on conventional search engines. mining to medical informatics. [4 ] proposes an implementation of Swanson's ABC model for literature-based discovery, in which relation A-C inferred from co-occurrence of A-B and that of B-C is ranked based on the contextual similarity of A-B and B-C occurrences. [5] proposes a sy stem supporting manual curation process by the automatic extraction of knowledge on fungal enzymes. [6] presents a system called ASCOT for searching relevant clinical trials for speeding-up the writing of new trial. The system integrates up-to -date metadata classification and to the analysis of clinical trials represented by structured and free-text fields. [7] reports on an approach to use parsers to accomplish Task 3 of the BioNLP Shared Task of 2009. on Data and Text Mining techni ques applied in biomedical informatics. [8] presents applyi ng topic models to induce latent features of text for use in word sense disambiguation. [9] reports on a technique for keyword extraction and expansion in biomedical literature that innova tively draws on both MeSH terms and word co-occurrence. [10] proposes an index update algorithm of RDF databases based on a recently developed RDF engine. [11] examines the correlation be tween gene expression patterns and different regions of the human brain using existing microarray data and several analy tical tools, such as bioconductor and k-means clustering in R. organized in conjunction with CIKM in 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010. We invite researchers and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds such as computer science, information system, information science, bioinforma tics, medical informatics, and medical sciences. The main objec tive of the workshop will be to strengthen the cooperation within the growing community in medical data and text mining research, allowing lively exchange of ideas and foster new collaborations.
