 Information retrieval (IR) and information privacy/security are two fast-growing computer science disciplines. There are many synergies and connections between these two disci-plines. However, there have been very limited efforts to con-nect the two important disciplines. On the other hand, due to lack of mature techniques in privacy-preserving IR, con-cerns about information privacy and security have become serious obstacles that prevent valuable user data to be used in IR research such as studies on query logs, social media, tweets, sessions, and medical record retrieval. This privacy-preserving IR workshop aims to spur research that brings together the research fields of IR and privacy/security, and research that mitigates privacy threats in information re-trieval by constructing novel algorithms and tools that en-able web users to better understand associated privacy risks. H.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Storage and Re-trieval Privacy-Preserving Information Retrieval
Information retrieval provides a set of information seeking, organization, analysis, and decision-making techniques. In-formation privacy/security defends information from unau-thorized or malicious use, disclosure, modification, attack, and destruction. There are many synergies and connections between these two disciplines. For example, information re-trieval researchers or practitioners often need to consider pri-vacy or security issues in designing solutions of information processing and management, while researchers in informa-tion privacy and security often utilize information retrieval techniques when they build the adversary models. However, there have been limited efforts to connect the two disciplines.
A few instances of IR practices have raised concerns about privacy and security. One famous example is the AOL query log release that raised a great deal of controversial discus-sions about how IR researchers can use available online ma-terials to advance their research while preserving users X  pri-
