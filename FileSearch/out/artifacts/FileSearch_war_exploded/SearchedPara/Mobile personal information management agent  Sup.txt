 1. Introduction
Personal information management (PIM) is  X  X  X ntended to support the activities we, as individuals, perform to order our son, 2006 ; Jones &amp; Teevan, 2007 ) X  X . The scope of PIM is very broad, including management of the scattered information on PIM on computers can be further classified along the dimensions of computer applications such as email ( Whittaker, Bellotti, contacts ( Zhou, 2007 ). The functions of different PIM applications are not exclusive, but can have overlaps ( Zhou, 2007 ). For example, a to-do could be a calendar item or an entry of contact information. We focus on function-oriented PIM in this study. Although commercial PIM tools become widely available, people still constantly experience a variety of problems. A common one is that they have difficulty in keeping and finding the information. For example, it may not be easy to find is possible that different copies of contact information for the same person are stored in different PIM applications. Existing PIM tools require extensive involvement of human users in managing personal information such as to-dos and contacts. This kind of activity consumes more time than necessary every day ( Teevan et al., 2006 ; Zhou, 2007 ).

In recent years, there has been a tremendous growth in both capabilities and personal use of mobile handheld devices such as smart phones and PDAs, which allows for any-time any-where access to personal information. Managing personal information on handheld devices effectively, however, is far from trivial, because the physical constraints of such devices, such as the small screen size and limited input methods, pose various challenges to information entry and navigation ( Adi-pat, Zhang, &amp; Zhou, 2011; Paelke, Reimann, &amp; Rosenbach, 2003; Samaras, 2002; Sarker &amp; Wells, 2003 ).  X  integration for PIM on mobile devices. PIMA is able to interpret user inputs in natural language and identify the appropriate applications for handling PIM requests. Based on the result of an empirical study, PIMA is shown to improve the perceived ease-of-use, usefulness, and efficiency of PIM, which in turn account for positive user attitude and intention to use the PIM system. The findings of this study provide suggestions to improve the design of PIM systems on mobile hand-held devices. 2. Theoretical background and research hypotheses 2.1. Personal information management (PIM) sonal information includes names, phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, URLs, to-do lists, references, directory paths, flashing thoughts or ideas, appointments/meetings, passwords, phone messages, procedures, server addresses, instal-lation keys for software, and so on ( Campbell &amp; Maglio, 2003 ). The above personal information can be characterized by the following features: (1) small, light, and easy to create and destroy ( Lutters, 2004 ); (2) created in a rush, often resulting in vague and ambiguous interpretation due to non-standard abbreviations and limited information; (3) created frequently; (4) temporary or ephemeral but could be referenced on a daily basis; and (5) not easily remembered because of the reasons listed above. These features suggest that there is a strong need for support that can facilitate humans in managing personal information.
 sonal information ( Teevan et al., 2006 ). PIM activities help to  X  X  X stablish, use, and maintain a mapping between information and need ( Jones, 2007 ) X  X . The pervasiveness of handheld devices in support of communication and work activities signifi-cantly increases the amount, diversity, and heterogeneity of information being accessed and the speed of information pro-cessing on a daily basis. Therefore, despite that the ideas underlying PIM were initiated over half a century ago ( Bush, 1945 ), there has been renewed interest in PIM in social activities, science, as well as engineering disciplines ( Lansdale, 1988; Teevan et al., 2006 ). 2.2. Problems with traditional PIM support for mobile devices quickly emerged as a new platform for PIM. Calendar, contacts, and to-dos are among the original applications that have been built to support PIM activities on hand-held devices.
 its, scratch paper, and notebooks. Although mobile handheld devices were least used, most users would like to manage per-sonal information in an electronic form. Users who routinely interact face-to-face with others emphasize the need for mobile information notes ( Lutters, 2004 ). The above discrepancy between people X  X  actual choices and expectations for PIM high-lights the need of PIM support on mobile devices.
 enter and edit information on those devices; and (2) a piece of information is easy to get  X  X ost X  after being embedded in much of other information. They reveal two main high-level issues: complex input interaction and information fragmentation. 2.2.1. Complex user interaction users typically have to find the right application and then navigate to the right slots for data input one after another via ver-tical and horizontal scrolling. For example, while entering a new Contact entry, a user needs to fill in several slots such as name, phone number, and address. On the other hand, user PIM requests are typically unstructured and expressed in a con-tinuous flow of natural language. As a result, users have to mentally break down the information into individual segments according to pre-specified slots. Such a process demands additional cognitive resource of users beyond directly recording their flow of thoughts. This contradicts to the purpose of PIM, which is mostly for spur-of-the-moment situations and re-quires quick memory of notable information ( Campbell &amp; Maglio, 2003 ). If a PIM tool does not facilitate information entry, users may take the risk of losing information and decide to forego the tool.
 its the amount of information for system display, but also creates significant inconvenience for user input and navigation. As a result, user interaction with PIM tools on handheld devices is more difficult than their desktop counterpart. 2.2.2. Information fragmentation to go through separate learning curves. Moreover, information can be fragmented by the very applications and devices that have been designed to help us manage our information ( Karger &amp; Jones, 2006 ; Jones and Teevan, 2007 ). This contradicts the functional view of PIM that there could be a linkage between the information collected by different applications ( Zhou, 2007 ), or a personal information need may be mapped to the information items maintained by different applications ( Jones, 2007 ). For instance, if one of the items in your to-do list (one application) is to make an appointment with your dentist, you should know his or her phone number that is recorded in another application, namely contacts . If you accidentally entered the dentist X  X  contact information in the to-do list for convenience, and when you need to contact him or her later, you would not be able to find it from the contacts . Therefore, it would be beneficial for a PIM tool to help users locate information from related applications. 2.3. Mobile PIMA  X  our proposed model
To address the limitations of traditional PIM tools, we advance the underlying technologies by filling in the gap between user needs and affordability of existing PIM tools. To this end, we propose a model  X  mobile PIM agent, simply called PIMA hereafter, to improve PIM on mobile devices by addressing complex user interaction and information fragmentation. 2.3.1. Simplifying user interaction via natural language query
Natural language (NL) is the most natural way for humans to interact with computers. It has been widely used in support of database query, question answering, command and control, and other types of information systems ( Zhou, 2007 ). Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology attempts to enable computers to understand and generate human languages ( Allen, 1995 ). Many NLP techniques such as syntactic and semantic parsing have great potential in improving human X  X omputer interaction. An NL-enabled interface allows users to enter a search query in natural language rather than follow a special structured search syntax as with computer languages and command-line interfaces ( Thompson &amp; Ross, 1987 ). NL-enabled interfaces have great potential for PIM. For example, a user can issue the following requests via an NL interface:  X  X  X Do I have any] appointment for tomorrow? X  X , and  X  X  X What X  X ] Dean X  X  phone number? X  X  (The segments in parentheses are optional). The PIM system then analyzes the input, searches for the information, and act on the information. Additionally, NL interfaces bring about the economy in space usage, which is very desirable for mobile devices.

NLP technologies can be used to support users in various activities throughout the lifecycle of PIM. For example, users are allowed to compose and input PIM requests in natural language. Empowered by parsing and information extraction tech-niques, users save the effort of cognitively breaking a complete request into small pieces of information (e.g., phone numbers and names), as commonly required by a PIM application. With an NL interface and categorization techniques, users are also shielded from differences in the interfaces between various PIM applications. This is because an NL interface can determine the types of PIM application related to a user request. 2.3.2. Mitigating information fragmentation via application integration
PIM often deals with integrating information from various sources ( Zhou, 2007 ). The goal of application integration is to decrease processing time and increase functionality through coordination between applications with common goals or sim-ilar information processing or discovery needs, particularly with the aspects of creation, retrieval, and maintenance of a PIM system.
 vidual applications. However, users expect for application integration, which is crucial to the support of automatic informa-tion classification ( Campbell &amp; Maglio, 2003 ). A previous study aiming to provide ubiquitous access to unified messaging found that users wanted a new system to make their life simpler but at the same time they did not want to add one more mentation problem ( Jones, 2007 ). Therefore, by providing a unified interface to existing PIM applications, specifically by cre-ating linkage between information of different applications and classifying user requests, system usability is expected to get improved.

Jourknow ( Max Van, Michael, David, &amp; mc, 2007 ) supports application integration via structure extraction from light-weight arbitrary text entry, which provides access to entered text containing information that aligns with structured appli-cations directly through these applications such as calendar, address book, and web browser. Nonetheless, the system is not developed for mobile handheld devices, and thus the system design does not take into account of the physical constraints of mobile devices. In addition, the system was not evaluated with a formal user study. 2.4. Hypotheses
Our overall assumption is that users prefer PIMA over TPIM (traditional PIM) support that do not offer NL interface and application integration. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) ( Davis, 1989 ) is widely used to explain user acceptance of information technologies. To evaluate user acceptance of PIMA, we adopted three factors from the original TAM model, including perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. In view that PIM tasks are usually performed un-der time constraint, efficiency was also included.

Among the frequently discussed usability guidelines for interface design (e.g., Molich &amp; Nielsen, 1990; Nielsen, 1993 ), there are  X  X peak the user X  X  language X  and  X  X inimize the user memory load X . In the study of an NL application ( Kelley, 1984 ), users felt it very fascinating to be able to express their commands directly in English because it is flexible, at a more human level, and comfortable to use. Thus the interaction via NL in PIMA is expected to reduce the user memory load by avoiding the use of menus and specific syntax. Users are not distracted by the system interface but can concentrate on com-posing high-quality PIM requests. With the support of application integration in PIMA, users X  cognitive effort is further re-duced by being removed from peculiar features of individual PIM applications and by having unified access to all the information. Therefore, we hypothesize: interface of PIMA parallels a post-it note or a scratchpad that still dominates people X  X  choice for PIM nowadays ( Campbell &amp; Maglio, 2003 ). Specifically, PIMA allows users to note down their spontaneous requests in natural language such as Eng-lish. Moreover, PIMA addresses the difficulty in using different PIM applications by offering a uniform interface to and hiding the details of individual PIM applications. By simplifying complex user-system interaction into a single NL request, PIMA is expected to be easy to use even by novice users who are unfamiliar with traditional PIM tools. Thus, we hypothesize: tools impose on users the burden of choosing appropriate PIM applications and navigating to specific slots in an application for input. In contrast, PIMA routes user requests to appropriate applications, which would save her effort and time in archiv-ing temporary notes for future use. As a result, PIMA is particularly effective when there is insufficient time to scrutinize an application and find the right function to execute a query. Efficiency is the production of the desired result with the mini-mum waste of time, effort, or skill. Given the same amount of time, PIMA is expected to handle more requests than tradi-tional PIM support.
 mation available or presented to the individual) and their affective evaluation of those consequences ( Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1980 ). TAM suggests that users formulate a positive attitude toward the technology when they perceive the technology to be useful and easy to use ( Davis, 1989 ). However, it has been argued that  X  X  X ttitudes toward usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technol-ogy evolve ( Bagozzi, Davis, &amp; Warshaw, 1992 ). X  X  We overcame the above problem by asking users to complete PIM tasks with a prototype system before eliciting their attitude. Both perceived usefulness and ease-of-use explain a significant percentage of the variations in the attitude towards using mobile devices, which in turn influences the intention to use ( Lee, Kim &amp; Chung, 2002 ). Therefore, we propose the last two hypotheses as follows: 3. Experiment method vs. TPIM or traditional PIM), and five dependent variables in this study. The latter contains perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, attitude, efficiency, and intention to use.
 questions were all measured on Likert scales of 1 X 7. Based on the feedback from three participants in a pilot study, the re-search procedure, description, and questionnaire items were refined. The final list of questions is shown in Appendix A . 3.1. A prototype system and Orsus solutions ( www.orsus.com ). NLP techniques were used to parse and understand user requests in natural language.
Case-based reasoning was used to classify user requests into different applications. The Orsus solution was employed to sup-port the integration of a variety of internal and external information sources. The PIMA prototype was implemented with
J2ME and WTK toolkits. The implementation is focused on the  X  X  X riginal X  X  PIM ( Lassila, 2008 ), which mostly encompasses managing the user X  X  calendar, address book, and to-do list. The following example illustrates how the PIMA system works. A TPIM prototype was also implemented with the same toolkits to serve as the baseline in this study. The user of TPIM needs to choose the appropriate application for her PIM need from a list of candidates by clicking on the corre-sponding radio button and then activating the application by clicking the Select button. For example, if contacts is se-lected, the system will display the current list of contacts. Next, the user needs to select the appropriate operation such as add from a list of candidates. For instance, if add is selected, a blank screen for a new contact would be dis-played for the user to enter information. The contacts interface of TPIM looks the same as Fig. B1 bof Appendix B ; how-ever, individual fields of the Contacts form are empty and would be filled out by the user instead of prefilled by the system. Both systems support the same set of PIM applications and operations. The PIMA prototype was interfaced with the TPIM system to provide users with an alternative access method. 3.2. Participants
There were a total of 17 participants in this study. They were undergraduate and graduate students recruited from two universities on the east-coast of the US They represented a wide range of demography, major area of studies, com-puter and cell phone experience, and experience with PIM tools. The average age of participants was 23, with an average of 15 years of formal school education and 8 years of computer experience. The average length of the ownership of mo-bile devices was four years and that of PIM tools was three years. Twenty percent of the total participants did not own or did not have more than one year of experience with any PIM tool. Participants who had more than six years of expe-rience with PIM tools or those who use PIM tools several times a day accounted for 25% and 35% of the participants, respectively. 3.3. Tasks and procedure
The participants were first informed of the general purpose of the study and asked to respond to a survey on their demo-graphic information. Then, participants received training on how to use both PIMA and TPIM systems for managing calendar, contacts, and to-dos. They were also provided with detailed descriptions of the systems and step-by-step instruction and examples. The training involves completing six tasks for each system separately.

After mastering how to use the systems, the participants proceeded with experiment tasks. There were two sets of tasks with equal level of complexity but different content. Each set consisted of 12 tasks, with each task corresponding to one of the four operations (i.e., adding, deleting, updating, and querying) and one of the three PIM applications (contacts, calendar, and to-dos).

The order of using the two PIM systems and the sequence of tasks for each system were counter-balanced to avoid any possible sequence effect. In other words, half of the participants used PIMA first and the other half used TPIM first. Upon the completion of each set of tasks, participants were asked to respond to a questionnaire on their experience and perception of the PIM system. Finally, participants answered two open-ended questions providing their feedback and preferences about the two PIM systems. The entire study lasted for about an hour on average. 4. Results
Convergent validity of the research instruments was assessed using Cronbach X  X  alpha, which should be greater than 0.7 ( Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994 ). The results showed that Cronbach X  X  alpha for all the factors ranged from 0.887 to 0.956. Thus, convergent validity was established. The means and standard deviations of dependent variables are reported in Table 1 . We conducted repeated measure analyses to test the hypotheses. The measurement for each construct was averaged across all the involving questionnaire items for each type of PIM support separately. The results are reported in Table 2 .

 5. Discussion efficient. In addition, participants felt more positively about PIMA and were more likely to use it than TPIM. They suggest that PIMA may be a practical way to support PIM, consistent with suggestions from the related literature ( Campbell &amp; Ma-glio, 2003; Jones, 2007; Karger &amp; Jones, 2006; Zhou, 2007 ).
 set and are often repeated. While there are many unsolved problems such as knowledge representation and commonsense reasoning, faced by those who develop NL processing techniques, those problems need not be entirely solved before NL inter-faces are used to support PIM.
 according to the current task, to extend users X  capacities when needed, and to minimize the amount of information that users must maintain in working memory, is consistent with the guidelines for usability engineering ( Neerincx &amp; Greef, 1998; Niel-sen, 1993 ). The findings suggest that PIMA allow users to focus on their PIM needs by shielding them from the details of individual PIM applications and reducing information overload.

 get very complex and even ambiguous, going beyond what current PIMA is able to correctly interpret. In other words, human X  X achine dialogs are still far from perfect human X  X uman conversation ( Lai et al., 2002 ). Further, people do not al-ways speak in grammatically correct and/or complete sentences ( Brennan, 1991 ). They tend to create typographical errors in electronic communication ( Zhou &amp; Zhang, 2005 ). Three participants of the study expressed some concerns about the sys-tem X  X  ability of understanding natural language.

X  X  One participant also raised the issue of unpredictability in that  X  X  X esults, though correct, are some-times not as predicted by the users. X  X  Thus, more advanced PIM support may require robust query parsing ( Carbonell &amp; Hayes, 1987 ), fuzzy matching mechanisms, and improved understanding of PIM requests in NL. Additionally, graph-or net-work based techniques ( Einat &amp; William, 2010 ) may be used in combination with NL and classification techniques to im-prove the performance of PIM. Further, in view of limited resources of mobile phones, the natural language-based interface model using a ranking technique ( So-Young, Jeunghyun, Hae-Chang, Do-Gil, &amp; Heuiseok, 2010 ) could be incorpo-rated to handle commands for controlling mobile devices, leaning pathway to speech-based interface.

PIMAmay be extendedto handlenew typesof informationandnew types ofdevices. In additionto the dataproducedbythe user herself, modern PIM also encompasses other kinds of data coming from other sources such as Web bookmarks/favorites, RSSfeeds,andvariousmediafilesandtheirassociatedmetadata( Jones,2007;Lassila,2008,p.460 ).SemanticWebtechnologies are helpful for building systems capable of dealing with unanticipated data and make it easier to exchange information and to integrateapplications( Lassila,2008 ).TheHaystack( Karger,Bakshi,Huynh,Quan,&amp;Sinha,2005 )projectprovidesaunifieddata environment basing on a semi-structured data model (i.e., RDF) to denote and relate information at fine-grained meaningful units. Moreover, various aspects of the context where personal notes were taken provides a potential basis for application inte-gration ( Jones et al., 2005 ). Further, future research examining the relationship between design features of PIM systems and complexity of PIM tasks would be a valuable theoretical addition to this line of inquiry. PIM should exploit the interactive and (human X  X omputer) collaborative nature of language use to enable dynamic and incremental learning from users X  input and situational context. Personalization is a major theme in enhancing the usability of information systems in recent years, which would allow PIM systems to better understand individuals X  strategy of PIM and usage of PIM tools ( Richard &amp; Sasse, 2004 ). Mobile devices present unique opportunities for personalization in that context-awareness that is offered via various sensors on mobile devices helps understanding aspects of user situation such as location, task, and actions ( Lassila, 2008 ). 6. Conclusions
With the explosion of PIM needs, the potential of integrated natural language support for PIM is compelling, particularly when faced with accelerated pace and increased diversity of information in individuals X  personal life and work today. PIMA is an exploratory step towards developing next generation intelligent mobile PIM solutions.
