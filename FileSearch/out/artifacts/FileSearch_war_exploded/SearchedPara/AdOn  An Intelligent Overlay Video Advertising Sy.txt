 This paper presents a new video advertising system, called AdOn, which supports intelligent overlay video ads. Unlike most current ad-networks such as Youtube that overlay the ads at fixed positions in the videos (e.g., on the bottom fifth of videos 15 seconds in), AdOn is able to automatically de-tect a set of spatio-temporal nonintrusive positions and as so-ciate the contextually relevant ads with these positions. T he overlay positions are obtained on the basis of video structu r-ing, face and text detection, as well as visual saliency anal y-sis, so that the intrusiveness to the users can be minimized. The ads are selected according to content-based multimodal relevance so that advertising relevance can be maximized. AdOn represents one of the first attempts towards intelli-gent overlay video advertising by leveraging video content analysis techniques.

 Contextual relevance, saliency detection, video advertis ing.
The quantity of videos on the Internet is increasing dra-matically with the proliferation of digital capture device s and explosive growth of video-sharing sites. On the other hand, we have witnessed a fast and consistently growing online advertising market in recent years. Motivated by the huge business opportunities and the advantages of video form of information representation, video advertising, wh ich associates advertisements with an online video, has become a hot research topic [1] [4]. According to LiveRail [3], arou nd 39% video streams are estimated to be currently monetized.
Although some ad-networks such as Youtube [5] have pro-vided overlay video ads, it is observed that the overlay po-sitions are intentionally preserved and fixed, e.g., on the Figure 1: An example of a video subscribing AdOn service. The highlighted yellow rectangle indicates that an ad is overlaid on this video shot, while the yellow spots on the timeline indicate the overlay ads in the video stream. The relevant ads are embedded at the non-salient positions (bottom or top) on the suitable frames, while the corresponding accompany ads appears beside the video player (on the right). bottom fifth of videos 15 seconds [5]. These positions are not always the best for overlay ads, as there are sometimes close captions TV logos, or other important information. The ads overlaid in these areas will lead to intrusive viewin g experience. Although there are recently a few systems for overlay advertising [1] [2], they are not practical for real -world applications. For example, AdImage predominantly focuses on image-based ad matching while neglects the ad positions (the ads always appear on the right-bottom cor-ner) [1]. The virtual content insertion [2] is not practical for user generated videos as these videos are typically with poo r visual quality, so that detecting smooth area in the frames and aligning the ad by geometric transformation are very challenging. Therefore, an intelligent but practical over lay video advertising system is desired for both online amateur and professional video programs.

We demonstrate in this work the implementation of an intelligent overlay video advertising system, named AdOn. The relevant ads each consisting of a product logo, name, description, and link, are selected based on not only tex-tual relevance but also visual similarity so that the overla y ads yield contextual relevance to the video content. The ad insertion positions are automatically discovered based on video highlight and nonintrusive region, to minimize the in-trusiveness of the ads while maximizing the effectiveness of advertising. Furthermore, the overlay ads appear in an in-teractive way, i.e., the ads can be hidden or enlarged by users X  click. Figure 1 shows a snapshot of a video subscrib-ing AdOn service.
Figure 2 illustrates the system architecture of AdOn. A video is represented by the combination of visual track (vid eo stream), audio track (transcripts from closed caption and a u-tomatically recognized characters from the keyframes), an d surrounding text (title and keywords). The surrounding tex t and scripts are used for selecting a list of relevant ads by text-based matching techniques. The video stream is first decomposed into a series of shots are keyframes. The over-lay captions are obtained by an optical character recogniti on (OCR) engine based on the keyframes. Then, we detect a set of overlay ad positions based on content intrusiveness pear at the nonintrusive (e.g., smooth) region in the video highlights (i.e., the most attractive shots). The shot intr u-siveness is based on the combination of face, caption, and image saliency maps, while shot importance is measured by the duration and motion intensity. Given a candidate list of ads and overlay positions, a matching module will associate each ad with the most suitable position. Ad Ranking In video advertising, ads are expected to be relevant to video contents in which the ads will be embed-ded. Given the surrounding text and script associated with a video, as well as the keywords associated with each ad, we adopt the cosine distance in Vector Space Model (VSM) as the basis of textual relevance between the texts associated with the video and ad [4].
 Overlay Ad Position Detection Generally, the ads are expected to appear in the most attractive shots but should not occlude the important information in the correspond-ing frames. To this end, we detect the candidate ad posi-tions in each shot by considering both the content impor-tance and intrusiveness. Suppose we have N s shots in a video. The content importance Im ( s i ) indicates the X  X ttrac-tiveness X  of the content in shot s i , which can be measured by the shot duration D ( s i ) and motion intensity I ( s Im ( s i ) = D ( s i )  X  I ( s i ). Intuitively, the long duration and the intensive motion usually indicates something importan t happening in this shot. The content intrusiveness I n ( s measures whether advertising the top or bottom fifth areas Figure 3: Detection of spatio-temporal ad overlay position. of video frames would be intrusive to users. Figure 3 illus-trate the computation of In ( s i ). For the shot s i , we collect the neighboring frames around its keyframe k i with the pre-served ad duration (e.g., 15 sec). Then, several maps are calculated for each frame j , including a text map M T ( j ), a face map M F ( j ), and an image saliency map M S ( j ). An in-trusive map M ( j ) is obtained by combining the three maps. The higher intensity the pixel in M ( j ), the more intrusive it is to users. We only calculate the energy in the top and bot-tom fifth areas (i.e., M U ( j ) and M B ( j )) as we only consider these two regions for overlay ad. The intrusiveness In ( s is given by In ( s i ) = min { M U ( s i ) , M B ( s i ) } , where M and M B ( s i ) are the averaged M U ( j ) and M B ( j ) over the neighboring frames, respectively. As a result, a list of can -didate ad positions can be obtained by sorting all the shots according to Im ( s i )  X  (1  X  In ( s i )).
 Ad-Position Association Given a rank list of relevant ads and positions, as well as a given number of ads per video, the association of ad-position can be performed by some heuristic rules in an iterative or optimized way like [4]. For example, we can select the shot with the highest Im ( s i (1  X  In ( s i )), select one region by min { M U ( s i ) , M the overlay position in this shot, and associate the ads with the highest relevance and the best visual similarity betwee n the ad and the corresponding keyframe.
We compared AdOn to conventional advertising where an overlay ad unit is displayed on the bottom fifth of videos 15 seconds. We have collected more than 14,000 online videos and 7,285 product logos, among which 30 videos are used for subjective evaluations with 12 subjects. For each video , three subjects were invited to give the satisfaction scores of ad positions and the overall satisfaction scores (1-5). The ad position and the overall satisfaction scores for conven-tional ads are 3.4 and 3.6, while those for AdOn are 3.8 and 4.1, respectively. The higher score indicates the highe r satisfaction. It is observed that AdOn achieved better per-formance and thus provided a better user experience than conventional advertising.
