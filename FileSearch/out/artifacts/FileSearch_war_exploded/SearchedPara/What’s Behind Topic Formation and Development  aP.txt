 Over the past several years, there has been a great interest in topic detection and tracking (TDT). Recently, analyzing general research trend from the huge amount of history doc-uments also arouses considerable attention. However, exist-ing work on TDT mainly focuses on overall trend analysis, and is unable to address questions such as  X  X hat determines the evolution of a topic? X  and  X  X hen and how does a new topic get formed? X .

In this paper, we propose a core group model to explain the dynamics and further segment topic development. Ac-cording to the division phase and interphase in the life cycle of a core group, a topic is separated into four states, i.e. birth state, extending state, saturation state and shrinkage state. Experimental results on a real dataset show that the division of a core group brings on the generation of a new topic, and the progress of an entire topic is closely correlated to the growth of a core group during its interphase.

When a researcher first enters a scientific field, he/she may raise several typical questions such as  X  X hen does this field emerge? X   X  X rom the very beginning to present, how does the area develop? X . A simple strategy toward answering these inquiries is to do paper survey. The main obstacle to the reading process is the huge number of publications. For instance, DBLP, a computer science bibliography site, has indexed more than one million articles and is still growing at a rapid pace. Topic analysis can help organize a list of writings and make the process of reading easier. As a result, it has become an active research field in recent years. There has been much work on topic detection and tracking, with a variety of topic models being introduced in the literature [4, 5, 13]. However, existing work including TDT mainly focuses on overall trend analysis, and is unable to address the above mentioned questions.

This paper reports our attempt on studying topic forma-tion and development by modeling topics as communities in a social network, and then analyzing the dynamics as well as the distinctive evolution trace of such topical communities. Specifically, we propose a core group model to analyze the growth procedure of a topic and demonstrate that the move-ment of a core group plays a key role in the topic develop-ment. Several fundamental research articles, if growing into central nodes and further forming a core group, will bring their followers to separate from its matrix community thus generate a new topic. Such a division occurs in the division phase of a core group. In addition, the spread or shrink-age of a topic is an outcome of that of a core group during its interphase. The division phase and interphase together constitute the life cycle of a core group.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 analyzes the formation and development of topical com-munities based on core group model. Section 3 presents an algorithm for topic development segmentation. Section 4 provides experimental results. Section 5 reviews related work. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
Let P be a scientific paper set { p 1 | t 1 , p 2 | t 2 , , p p is the paper id and t i is the time when p i was published. Let G be a citation network (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E . Each vertex in V is an element from P . Each edge in E is of the form: ( &lt; p i , p j &gt;, t i ), where &lt; p an edge if p j has a citation from p i and t i is the timestamp of edge &lt; p i , p j &gt; which is exactly the same as when p published.

One citation network can be partitioned into a number of communities. A community is defined as groups of vertices (articles) within which connections are dense but between which they are sparse [10, 9].

Definition 1. Topical community Given a citation net-work G = ( V, E ), the community of a topic T  X  is a subset of articles { p  X  1 , p  X  2 , p  X m } in which the citation edges are much denser than those linked to any other community.
Everett M. Rogers, the pioneer of diffusion of innovations theory, pointed out that information flows through social networks and the nature of networks plays key role in this procedure [11]. Diffusion of a new idea or new research topic exhibits similarity to diffusion of innovation. Hence we present the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 1 A core group, consisting of several central nodes, plays the key role in the formation and development of topical community.

We adopt the relative within module degree [6], z , as the center criterion to quantify how a node is connected to other nodes in its community. The definition of z is listed below:
In Equation 1, d T n is the modular degree of node n , i.e. de-gree of a particular node n in community T and &lt; ... &gt; is the average modular degree value which is taken over all nodes n in community T . The nodes that have a high relative within module degree ( z &gt; 2 . 5 ) are classified as centers.
Accordingly, a core group of a topical community at a specific time can be defined as:
Each core group has its own life span. A life cycle of a core group consists of two phases. One is the division phase and the other is interphase. During interphase, the core group is stable and there are no substantial changes in it. In the division phase, the core group will vary tempestuously. Some nodes will grow into new cores. When the number of such nodes is sufficient and their influence is great enough, they will bring their followers to separate from their matrix community and form a new community. We further define the life cycle of a core group as follows.
 Definition 2. Life cycle of a core group is a time period. It starts from one significant division of the core group into two, and ends at the core group X  X  next important division or its merging into another community.
According to the paradigms of Kuhn [7], the life cycle of a scientific theme can be divided into several phases: birth, flourish, stagnation and death. We now present our metrics to measure the states of topic development based on the life cycle of a core group in a topical community.

Supposing there is a topical community T  X  and its core group CG  X  . From a specific time point, some new articles join T  X  . If these articles draw enough attention, there must be lots of successive papers citing them. These articles and their followers gradually form a new core group CG  X  . After the division, the topical community T  X  , whose core group is CG  X  , will go forward along its original path. Meanwhile, a new topical community T  X  , whose core group is CG  X  , will grow up rapidly. We now present a measure of  X (  X ,  X  ) to indicate the birth of a topical community.

Definition 3. Reconstruction capability is an ability of reconstructing a topical community T i  X  +  X  +  X  at time point i from two communities T i +1  X  and T i +1  X  at time point i+1 , where  X  is an adjusting factor which represents some minor themes.
 Then, we have:
Equation 4 guarantees that  X  and  X  are two main themes in T i  X  +  X  +  X  . Equation 5 ensures that each core group in T and T  X  is itself large enough. Here  X  is the user defined reconstruction factor and  X  is the user defined size control factor for a single community . In practice, a percentile be-tween 25 and 75 is considered normal, thus one can simply set  X  to 0.75 and  X  to 0.25.

During the interphase, the core group of a topical com-munity does not change a lot, and the topic movement is represented as the variation of the neighbors of a core group. Hence we propose the following definitions and measures for labeling the three states of a topical community during the interphase.

Let the n-order neighbors of a core group in a topical community be the vertices whose distances from the core node are smaller than n .

Definition 4. Outer core group is a set of 1-or 2-order neighbors of a core group, i.e.,
In the extending state, new fundamental articles and suc-cessive papers join the topical community one after another. From the viewpoint of the network, both the core group and outer core group of a topical community increase. Hence, the conditions for entering the extending state of a topical community are:
In the saturation state, the topic reaches the maximum development of form and there is only follow-up research. That is to say, the core group stops increasing, but the outer core group continues growing. Hence, the conditions for entering the saturation state of a topical community are:
In the shrinkage state, both the core group and outer core group of a topical community begin decreasing. Hence, the conditions for entering the shrinkage state of a topical com-munity are:
After finishing assigning state label to a topic, the task of topic development segmentation becomes quite easy. We only need to find out the time point at which one state transits to another. The steps for analyzing topic formation and development are given in Algorithm 1.

The initial topics are communities in the citation network of the first time point. At each following time point, we perform two tasks: (1) The first is to check whether there is a new topical community generated using Equations 4 and 5. If there is, then add this new topic into the topic trace list. (2) The second is to check the topical communities left, i.e. those being at interphase. This is done by comparing each current community with its previous counterpart using Equations 7-9. Finally, we check each topic development trace. If there is a transition, then sign a mark on it.
We have conducted experiments on hep-th (high-energy physics theory) dataset from KDD Cup 2003 [1]. The cita-tion structure includes 29555 papers and 352807 citations from January 1993 through May 2003. For each month m we create a sub-graph using all vertices whose timestamps are earlier than m . Consequently, we have a sequence of time periods T 1 =Jan. 1993, T 2 =Feb.1993,..., T 125 = May 2003 and the relevant time sub-graph G 1 , G 2 ,..., G 125 . Figure 1: Comparison between the size of core group and community during interphase.
 Table 3: Correlation between core group, outer core groups and topic
After running our proposed TFD algorithm on G 1 ,..., G 125 we have found the core group of C 2 was indeed divided in Nov. 1998. Table 1 provides the community ID, commu-nity size, core size, and the most significant node ID for the division phase of core group of C 2 . It can be seen from Table 1 that the module (community) #829 contains 3175 articles (nodes). Using Equation 2, we find 72 cores in it. In December 1998, this module has two successive modules: #838 and #840. The former is a newly formed topic, i.e. C 3 , while the latter is a continued one, i.e. C The reconstruction capability of these two communities is the division of C 1 took place in March, 1995. Table 2 presents the characteristics for this division.
For a core group during interphase, we mainly study its influence on the whole community. Figure 1 depicts the changes of three typical core groups in comparison with the changes of their corresponding communities.

If examining every two upper and lower sub-graphs in Fig. 1, one can find that the shapes of curves for core group and its corresponding community are quite alike, though the curve for community looks smoother than that for the core group due to its large scaling. We must point out that many other traces exhibit a similar form. Those results are omitted only because of the space limit here.

Table 3 presents correlation between the size of core group, outer core groups and entire community on C 1 , C 2 and C during their interphases. From Table 3, we observe posi-tive correlations between core group size and topic size on all three communities C 1 , C 2 and C 3 during their inter-phases. This test further confirms that our core group model is statistically meaningful. The second and the third rows in Table 3 show an increment of correlation between outer core group and whole community. The higher correlation indicates that, though core groups are responsible for the evolving of the whole community, their influence spreads out through their neighbors.
This work overlaps with three lines of research: (1) topic trend analysis, (2) community discovery, and (3) evolution of social networks.

Over the past several years, topic trend analysis has at-tracted considerable interests. A variety of useful topic mod-els have been proposed to discover summaries of documents. The must notable one is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) style topic model [4]. After that, many variations of this model were introduced and applied to explore trends in the literature [12, 13]. In general, all LDA-style topic mod-els assume that each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics, followed by choosing each word in the document from a topic. They unravel a relationship of term-document-topic, but overlook the inheritance of re-search from previous topics to following ones.

Network evolution has been studied from the topological point of view. These studies focus on the structural prop-erties [3, 2, 8]. For example, Berger-Wolf and Saia [3] propose a framework for dynamic social network analysis, where a community at different time period is traced by comparing the similarity between meta-groups in communi-ties. Recently, Leskovec et al. [8] develop a temporal model which combines node lifetime with time gaps to explain how the edges are added to a node. Note these studies address issues that are quite different from our work in that our work leverages the community evolution and scientific topic development in a unified model.

As community discovery is not the focus of this paper, we omit their details, and the readers are referred to the relevant bibliography.
In this paper , we have addressed on a new research task, i.e. revealing the underlying reasons for topic evolution and then segmenting topic per its states of development. We have first divided the life cycle of a core group into two phases: division phase and interphase. The former is the time period a new core group separates from its matrix core group, while the latter is the time period the core group being stable. We have demonstrated the life cycle of core groups and observed the division of core groups on real dataset. Experimental results also show that the progress of an entire topic is highly dependant on the growth of a core group during its interphase.

The work proposed in this study can be used by scientists to meet the needs of following the most recent research. It also makes special and fine searching possible.
