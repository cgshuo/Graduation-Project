 1. Introduction
Vibration control of machines worked by engines has attracted great amount of research activities during last decades. In particular, vehicles X  motions are influenced by the harmful effects of vibrations caused by engines and roads which have a pivotal
Barak (1991) have shown that the interior vibration of a vehicle has a significant effect in comfort and road holding capability. In the case of reducing this type of vibration, manufacturers X  efforts have led to produce a suspension system that is installed between road excitation and vehicle body. Bouazara (1997) studied the influence of suspension system parameters on the vibration of vehicle X  X  model. In the same year, Hrovat (1991) used a three-dimensional vibration model instead of the two-dimensional model to get more exact results. Crolla (1992) applied a semi-active suspension model for improving the performance of vehicle. Bouazara and Richard (1996) presented their vibration model in three-dimensional space demonstrating that this model has a good estimation of the vehicle behavior. Bouazara and
Richard (2001) also studied three types of suspension system (active, semi-active and passive) for an eight-degree of freedom vibration model. In his works, Bouazara combined all the respect to all the objective functions. Instead, there is a set of optimal solutions, well-known as Pareto optimal solutions (Srinivas and Deb, 1994 ; Fonseca and Fleming, 1993 ; Coello Coello and Christiansen, 2000 ; Coello Coello et al., 2002 ), which distinguishes significantly the inherent natures between single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems. V. Pareto (1848 X 1923) was the French X  X talian economist who first devel-oped the concept of multi-objective optimization in economics
Pareto (1896) . The concept of a Pareto front in the space of objective functions in multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) stands for a set of solutions that are non-dominated to each other but are superior to the rest of solutions in the search space. Evidently, changing the vector of design variables in such a
Pareto optimal solutions consisting of these non-dominated solutions would not lead to the improvement of all objectives simultaneously. Consequently, such change leads to a deteriora-another solution in that Pareto set, although both are superior to others in the rest of search space. The inherent parallelism in evolutionary algorithms makes them suitably eligible for solving
MOPs. The early use of evolutionary search is first reported in 1960s by Rosenberg (1967) . Since then, there has been a growing interest in devising different evolutionary algorithms for MOPs.
Among these methods, the vector-evaluated genetic algorithm (VEGA) proposed by Schaffer (1985) , Fonseca and Fleming X  X  genetic algorithm (FFGA) Fonseca and Fleming (1993) , non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) by Srinivas and Deb (1994) and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) by
Zitzler and Thiele (1998) and the Pareto-archived evolution strategy (PAES) by Knowles and Corne (1999) are the most important ones. A very good and comprehensive survey of these methods has been presented in Coello Coello, 1999 and in Khare et al. (2003). Coello Coello http://www.lania.mx/ ccoello/EMOO/ has also presented an Internet-based collection of many papers as
NSGA and FFGA as Pareto-based approaches use the revolutionary non-dominated sorting procedure originally proposed by Gold-berg (1989) . There are two important issues that have to be considered in such evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods: driving the search towards the true Pareto optimal set or front and preventing premature convergence or maintaining the genetic diversity within the population Toffolo and Benini (2003) . The lack of elitism was also a motivation for modification of that algorithm to NSGA-II Goldberg (1989) , in which a direct elitist mechanism, instead of a sharing mechanism, has been introduced to enhance the population diversity. This modified algorithm represents the state-of-the-art in evolutionary MOPs Coello Coello and Becerra (2003). A comparison study among
SPEA and other evolutionary algorithms on several problems and test functions showed that SPEA clearly outperforms the other tions reported in reference ( Toffolo and Benini, 2003 ) demon-strated, however, that the elitist variant of NSGA (NSGA-II) equals the performance of SPEA.

In this paper, a new multi-objective uniform-diversity genetic algorithm (MUGA) with a diversity preserving mechanism called the e -elimination algorithm is used for multi-objective optimiza-tion of a five-degree of freedom vehicle vibration model.
The conflicting objective functions that have been considered for minimization are, namely, seat acceleration (  X  z c ), forward tire sprung mass and forward tire ( d 1 ) and relative displacement between sprung mass and rear tire ( d 2 ). The design variables used in the optimization of vibration are, namely, seat damping coefficient ( c ss ), vehicle suspension damping coefficient ( c 2.4. Definition of a Pareto front
For a given MOP, the Pareto front P T  X  is a set of vector of objective functions, which are obtained using the vectors of decision variables in the Pareto set P ,thatis P T  X   X f F  X  X  X 
P T  X  is a set of the vectors of objective functions mapped from P .
Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used for multi-objective optimization because of their natural properties suited for these types of problems. This is mostly because of their parallel or population-based search approach. Therefore, most of the difficulties and deficiencies within the classical methods in solving multi-objective optimization problems are eliminated. For example, there is no need for either several runs to find the Pareto front or quantification of the importance of each objective using numerical weights. In this way, the original non-dominated sorting procedure given by Goldberg Goldberg (1989) was the catalyst for several different versions of multi-objective optimiza-tion algorithms ( Srinivas and Deb, 1994 ; Fonseca and Fleming, 1993 ). However, it is very important that the genetic diversity within the population be preserved sufficiently. This main issue in
MOPs has been addressed by many related research works Toffolo and Benini (2003). Consequently, the premature convergence of MOEAs is prevented and the solutions are directed and distributed along the true Pareto front if such genetic diversity is well provided. The Pareto-based approach of NSGA-II Deb et al. (2002) has been used recently in a wide area of engineering
MOPs because of its simple yet efficient non-dominance ranking procedure in yielding different levels of Pareto frontiers. However, the crowding approach in such state-of-the-art MOEA
Coello Coello and Becerra (2003) is not efficient as a diversity preserving operator, particularly in problems with more than 2 objective functions ( Nariman-Zadeh et al., 2005 ; Jamali et al., 2010 ) .

In this work, a new multi-objective uniform-diversity genetic algorithm method called MUGA is presented so that it can safely be used for any number of objective functions (particularly for more than 2 objectives) in MOPs. 2.5. Multi-objective uniform-diversity genetic algorithm (MUGA)
The multi-objective uniform-diversity genetic algorithm (MUGA) uses non-dominated sorting mechanism together with a e -elimination diversity preserving algorithm to get Pareto optimal solutions of MOPs more precisely and uniformly. 2.5.1. The non-dominated sorting method
The basic idea of sorting of non-dominated solutions originally proposed by Goldberg (1989) , which has been used in different evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms, as in
NSGA-II Deb et al. (2002), has been adopted here. The algorithm simply compares each individual in the population with others to determine its non-dominancy. Once the first front has been found, all its non-dominated individuals are removed from the main population and the procedure is repeated for the subsequent fronts until the entire population is sorted and non-dominantly divided into different fronts.

A sorting procedure to constitute a front could be simply accomplished by comparing all the individuals of the population and including the non-dominated individuals in the front. Such procedure can be simply represented as following steps: 1. Get the population (pop)
Fig. 2 . It first initiates a population randomly. Using genetic operators, another same size population is then created. Based on the e -elimination algorithm, the whole population is then reduced by removing e -similar individuals. At this stage, the population is re-filled by randomly generated individuals which helps to explore the search space more effectively. The whole population is then sorted using non-dominated sorting procedure. The obtained fronts are then used to constitute the main population.
It must be noted that the front, which must be truncated to match the size of the population is also evaluated by e -elimination procedure to identify the e -similar individuals. Such procedure is only performed to match the size of the population within present deviations to prevent excessive computational effort to population size adjustment. Finally, unless the number of individuals in the first rank front is changing in certain number of generations, randomly created individuals are inserted in the main population occasionally (e.g. every 20 generations of having non-varying first rank front). 3. Multi-objective optimization of vehicle vibration model
A five-degree of freedom vehicle with passive suspension, which is adopted from ( Bouazara (1997) ) is shown in Fig. 3 . This model is composed of one sprung mass that joints to three unsprung masses (indicate tires and seat). Moreover, the effect of degrees of freedom, linear motion (in vertical direction for sprung and unsprung masses) and rotating motion (pitching motion) for sprung mass, in terms of acceleration, velocity and movement, are considered in formulation of motion equations. Parameters M m parameters are expressed as forward tire mass, rear tire mass, seat mass, sprung mass, momentum inertia of sprung mass, forward use of Newton X  X uler equations and can be written as follows
Bouazara (1997) : z  X  z s r y  X  4  X  z  X  z s l 1 y  X  5  X  z  X  z s  X  l 2 y  X  6  X

Further, _ z c , _ z i and _ z the ends of the sprung mass, respectively.  X  Z c ,  X  z s ,  X  z vertical seat acceleration, vertical acceleration of the central gravity of the sprung mass, vertical tires acceleration and rotating acceleration (pitch acceleration), respectively. Lastly, zp represent the excitation via road double bumps, as shown in Fig. 4 .
It is supposed that the vehicle moves at constant velocity v =20 m/s over a double bump, and it is further assumed that the rear tire follows the same trajectory as the front tire with a delay at Table 1 Bouazara (1997) .

In this paper, 50,000 r k ss r 150,000, 10,000 r k s1 r 20,000, c r 2000 and 0 r r r 0.5 are observed as 7 design variables to be Displacement (m) it will lead to the best possible combination of that pair of chosen, the corresponding values of pair of objectives will locate a point inferior to the corresponding Pareto front. Such inferior area right sides.

Fig. 5 depicts the Pareto front of seat acceleration and forward tire velocity representing different non-dominated optimum points with respect to the conflicting objectives. In this figure, points A and B 1 stand for the best seat acceleration and the best forward tire velocity, respectively. It should be noted that all the optimum design points in this Pareto fronts are non-dominated and could be chosen by a designer. It is clear from this figure that choosing a better value for any objective function in these Pareto fronts would cause a worse value of another objective function.
Clearly, there are some important optimal design facts between these objective functions that can be readily observed in that important optimal design fact. Optimum design point C 1 obtained in this paper exhibits a small increase in forward tire velocity in comparison with that of point B 1 (the design with the least forward tire velocity) whilst its seat acceleration improves about 13%. In fact, the trade-off design point, C 1, would not have been obtained without the use of the Pareto optimum approach presented in this paper.

Such non-dominated Pareto fronts of the other chosen sets of objective functions have been shown in Figs. 6 X 8 . Design point A stands for the best seat acceleration whilst points B 2 ,B
Relative displacement between sprung mass and forward tire (m) 0.052 0.054 0.056 0.058 0.062 0.064
Relative displacement between sprung mass and rear tire (m) for a designer. Moreover, such 5-objective optimization can subsume all the 2-objective optimization results presented in the previous section. This will allow finding a trade-off optimum design point from the view of all 5 objective functions simulta-neously. Therefore, in this section, 5 objective functions, namely, seat acceleration (  X  z c ), forward tire velocity ( _ z 1 ( _ z ), relative displacement between sprung mass and forward tire ( d ) and relative displacement between sprung mass and rear tire ( d ) are chosen for multi-objective optimization in which all of them are minimized simultaneously. A population of 80 indivi-duals with a crossover probability of 0.9 and mutation probability of 0.1 has been used in 240 generations.

Fig. 13 depicts the non-dominated individuals of 5-objective 2-objective optimization found in previous section. Such non-dominated individuals of both 5-and 2-objective optimizations have alternatively been shown in the plane of (  X  z c _ z there is a single set of individuals as a result of 5-objective planes together with the corresponding 2-objective optimization results obtained in previous section. Therefore, there are some points in each plane that may dominate others in the case of 5-objective optimization. However, these individuals are all non-dominated when considering all 5 objectives simultaneously. By careful investigation of the results of 5-objective optimization in each plane, the Pareto fronts of the corresponding 2-objective optimization previously found can now be verified in these figures. It can be readily observed that the results of such 5-objective optimization include the Pareto fronts of each 2-objective optimization and provide, therefore, more optimal choices for the designer.

It may now be desired to obtain an optimum design point out of all non-dominated 5-objective optimization process somehow satisfying all 5 objective functions. In other words, each of the obtained design points given in previous section is acceptable based on the pertinent 2 objective functions, but there is no reason that such an optimum design point existed in one of the 0.405 0.41 0.415 0.42 0.425 0.43 Forward tire velocity (m/s) 0.425 0.43 0.435 0.44 0.445 0.45 0.455 Rear tire velocity (m/s)
Relative displacement between sprung mass and forward tire (m) displacement between sprung mass and forward tire ( d 1 ) and relative displacement between sprung mass and rear tire ( d provide optimal choices of design variables based on Pareto non-dominated points. 4. Conclusion
A multi-objective genetic algorithm with a recently developed diversity preserving mechanism has been used to optimally design vehicle vibration model. The objective functions which conflict with ( _ z model led to the discovering of so me important trade-offs among those objective functions. The superiority of the obtained optimum design points was shown in compar ison with those reported in the functions which would not have been found otherwise. Further, it has consequently, more choices for optimal design.
