 Exploring PubMed to find relevant information is challenging and time-consuming because PubMed typically returns a long list of ar-ticles as a result of query. Semantic network helps users to explore a large document collection and to capture key concepts and rela-tionships among the concepts. The semantic network also serves to broaden the user X  X  knowledge and extend query keyword by detecting and visualizing new related concepts or relations hid-den in the retrieved documents. The problem of existing seman-tic network techniques is that they typically produce many redun-dant relationships, which prevents users from quickly capturing the underlying relationships among concepts. This paper devel-ops an online PubMed search system, which displays semantic net-works having no redundant relationships in real-time as a result of query. To do so, we propose an efficient semantic network construction algorithm, which prevents producing redundant re-lationships during the network construction. Our extensive ex-periments on actual PubMed data show that the proposed method is significantly faster than the method removing redundant rela-tionships afterward. Our method is implemented and integrated into a relevance-feedback PubMed search engine, called RefMed,  X  X ttp://dm.postech.ac.kr/refmed X , and will be demonstrated through the website.

PubMed-Medline is a biomedical and life science literature repos-itory that contains 18 million articles and keeps growing. It is one of the most important knowledge sources for medical doc-tors and biomedical researchers. PubMed supports an exact match-ing search using attributes including title, author, abstract, journal, MeSH terms. However, exploring PubMed to find relevant infor-mation is challenging and time-consuming because PubMed typi-cally returns a long list of articles as a result of query.
Semantic network helps users to explore a large document col-lection and to capture key concepts and relationships among the concepts [8]. The semantic network also serves to broaden the user X  X  knowledge and extend query keyword by detecting and vi-sualizing new related concepts or relations hidden in the retrieved documents. Typical semantic network techniques analyze the rela-tionship between concepts by considering co-occurrence of con-cepts [7, 3, 1]. For example, one of fundamental relationships among concepts is superset-subset relationship. If the document set showing a certain concept x is included in another document set showing another concept y , we call y is a superset of is a subset of y .

The problem of existing techniques generating semantic network is that, many of the superset-subset relationships are redundant thus do not provide additional information. Instead, they prevents users from quickly capturing the underlying relation among concepts. For example, in Figure 1, there are six superset-subset relation-ships. However, among them, three relationships (i.e., relationship  X  ,  X  ,  X  ) are redundant and thus do not provide meaningful infor-mation to user. To deliver information more precisely and clearly, we need to remove redundant relationships. However, identifying and removing such redundant relationships incur non-trivial com-putational overhead.

This paper proposes an efficient semantic network construction algorithm, which prevents producing redundant relationship dur-ing the network construction. Our extensive experiments on actual PubMed data show that the proposed method is significantly faster than the method removing redundant relationships afterward. Our method is implemented and integrated into a relevance-feedback Figure 1: Example of redundant relationships. Nodes are con-cepts and edges indicate superset-subset relationships PubMed search engine, called RefMed, http://dm.postech. ac.kr/refmed , and will be demonstrated through the website.
For example, Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the result of query  X  X rsa X . As a result of a query, 14,179 articles are retrieved, and the semantic network is shown in the middle of the figure. There are several subset concepts of the query concept, some of which have hidden subset concepts that will be expanded when clicked. The user can relocate the nodes by dragging them.
 Related Work: Automatic taxonomy generation (ATG) is a tech-nique to improve PubMed search quality and has been researched for a decade [5, 7, 3, 2, 1, 9]. The main goal of ATG is generating the structure of terms from document collection. Among various approaches for ATG, word-clustering-based approaches [4, 5, 7, 2, 3] generate structure of considerable terms in a document collec-tion. Most methods generate the hierarchical structure (e.g., tree) of considerable terms or concepts based on subsumption relation-ship.

Recently, hierarchical structure of ATG has been expanded to a more complex but flexible structure called semantic network [8]. The output of semantic network is a large graph, which is not lim-ited to tree, presenting relatedness among concepts. The output of semantic network is different from that of ATG, but the way of de-termining relationships among concepts is similar. It also uses sub-sumption relationship and other variations based on co-occurrence.
Basic structure and construction process of semantic network are introduced in [7, 8]. The semantic network consists of concepts and relationships among concepts. Two concepts may be related to each other as related set or superset-subset in the network. Concept: A concept means a considerable term in a document col-lection. A term becomes considerable if (1) it occurs more than a certain threshold in the search results and (2) the fraction of the term X  X  probability in the search results over the total document col-lection is higher than a threshold [7]. For example, a term becomes a concept when it satisfies the following two conditions. and where D and T are the retrieved documents and the total document collection, respectively.
 Superset-subset Relationship: The superset-subset relationship is determined in a similar way. If the document set of x i is almost included in that of x j but not in the other way, x j is a superset of x . where
Note that when x j is a superset of x i then | x j | &gt; | x | x | is the size of documents showing x i . It is clear because P D ( x j ) &gt;P D ( x i ,x j ) &gt; X  p  X  P D ( x i ) . Related term: Relationship related is also defined based on the co-occurrence ratio of two concepts. Suppose a term x j appears in most of the documents having x i and vice versa. Then, it indicates that there is a strong relationship between x i and x j .Thisiscalled related relationship. For example, concepts x i and x j become re-lated to each other if they satisfy the following conditions.
Figure 2.2 shows the framework of our system. If user enters a keyword, the system (1) first finds exactly matching documents as done in the original PubMed search engine, and (2) preprocesses the result documents by running stemming and stopwords. After that, the system (3) extracts the concepts, (4) constructs seman-tic network of concepts by analyzing the relationships among con-cepts, and (5) visualizes them by drawing an interactive graph. In the final query result, a semantic graph is presented with exactly matching documents as shown in Figure 2. This process is done in real-time.
This section presents an efficient semantic network construction method. Further details on the method and experiment results are found in our technical reports [6].
 Redundant Relationship: Redundant relationship is the relation-ship that can be induced by other relationships, thus do not provide additional information and need to be removed. Accordingly we define the redundant relationship as follows.
 denote c i is a superset of c j . A relationship c i  X  c if there exists another path c i  X  c k  X   X  X  X   X  c j in the semantic network.
We can detect and remove the redundant relationships after fully constructing the semantic network as a post processing. Let { ( c i ,c j ,Type ) } be the set of extracted relationships and each re-lationship is expressed by a triplet ( c i ,c j ,Type ) where are concepts and  X  X ype X  is the relationship type between c For example, a triplet ( c i ,c j , Superset ) indicates  X  of c j  X . The post-processing method first extracts R from the doc-ument set, and for each triplet ( c i ,c j , Superset )  X  R another path from c i to c j , it removes the triplet from
Note that the complexity of the post processing method is quadratic to the number of triplets in R because, for each triplet in ining the possibility of indirect paths takes an additional scan of Thus, at the worst case, when the number of relationships is propor-tional to the number of pairs of concepts (i.e., | R | = O n is the number of concepts), the complexity becomes O ( n 4 post-processing method is too expensive to run in our applications where the semantic network must be constructed in real-time as a result of query.
This section proposes a novel algorithm for generating the com-pact semantic network that has no redundant relationships and thus does not require removing redundant relationships afterward. The algorithm runs in two phases  X  (1) building minimal semantic net-work and (2) expanding the minimal semantic network to the com-pact semantic network .
 Phase 1. Building the minimal semantic network
We first define two new terminologies  X  closest superset and minimal semantic network . Closest superset is defined to be a su-perset that has the smallest supporting document size: be a set of supersets of c x . Among them, the smallest concept (i.e., arg min c i | c i | ) is the closest superset of c
The following Lemma shows that the relationship between a con-cept c x and its closest superset is always not redundant .
L EMMA 1. For any concept c x in a semantic network G ,are-lationship between c x and its closest superset is not redundant.
P ROOF . We prove this by contradiction. Let c i be the closest superset of c j (i.e., c i  X  c j ). In order for c i  X  c j there must be a sequence K = c 1  X   X  X  X   X  c n connecting c and c j (i.e., c i  X  K  X  c j ). Then, one of the concept c is a superset of c j and a subset of c i .Thatis, | c k | &gt; | c | c | &lt; | c i | from the definition of the superset-subset relationship. Thus, c i cannot be the closest superset of c j . Therefore, if closest superset of c j , c i  X  c j is not redundant.

Minimal semantic network is defined to be the semantic network in which the nodes have only their closest supersets: G =( C , R ) be a semantic network where C is a set of concepts and R is a set of triplets ( c i ,c j ,Type ) . A semantic network G )=( C , R (  X  X  )) is a minimal semantic network if, for all the superset-subset relationship R k =( c i ,c j , Superset ) the closest superset of c j .

To construct the minimal semantic network, we first sort the con-cepts C = { c 1 , ..., c n } according to their sizes in an ascending order. Then, for each concept c i , we check the superset-subset re-lationship from c i +1 to c n and stop checking when we find the first superset which will be the closest superset of c i .
 Phase 2. Expanding to compact semantic network G =( C , R ) be a semantic network where C is a set of concepts and R is a set of triplets ( c i ,c j ,Type ) . A semantic network G )=( C , R (  X  X  )) is a compact semantic network if, all the superset-subset relationship R k =( c i ,c j , Superset ) redundant, and all non-redundant relationship in R is in R
Once the minimal semantic network is built, we expand it to a compact semantic network by generating additional superset-subset relationships that are not redundant. We first prove by the following Lemma that, given a minimal semantic network G , any additional superset-subset relationship between c i and its ancestor redundant.

L EMMA 2. Let graph G be a minimal semantic network. For superset-subset relationships from one of c 1 , ..., c k to dundant.

Any additional path to c i from its ancestor c j is redundant be-cause there exists another path from c j to c i since c j of c i . From Lemma 2, we can skip examining the superset-subset relationship from c i to its ancestors. Based on this idea, we used sorted concept list and minimal semantic network. For each con-cept, we remove all the superset of the concept from the candidate list and test the relationship only between the concept and non-superset concepts. When another relationship is added, we also remove the supersets of the added concepts from the candidate list. We illustrate the expansion algorithm by the following example.
E XAMPLE 1. Figure 4(a), (b), and (c) respectively show an ex-ample of minimal semantic network, compact semantic network, the minimal semantic network, suppose we examine to find another non-redundant superset of c 7 . Then, we can first delete because they are ancestors of c 7 or itself (shown at the second list of Figure 4(c)). After that, we test the relationship between c and find new superset-subset relationship from c 5 to c 7 can delete c 5 and c 2 because c 2 became an ancestor of c at the third list of Figure 4(c)). If we repeat this process until we (a) minimal semantic network delete all the elements in the list, we will discover all the additional non-redundant supersets of c 7 . After testing this for all the nodes in the minimal semantic network, we finally get the compact semantic network of Figure 4(b).
We evaluate the proposed method against the post processing method that removes redundancy after construction. For evalua-tion, we implemented the methods in RefMed, an interactive search engine for PubMed.
 Implementation: The dynamic construction of semantic network is implemented in the PHP (v5.1.6) and the Adobe Flash CS4. The algorithm is implemented using the PHP and the visualization is implemented using the Flash. The implementation is integrated into our RefMed. The RefMed is implemented using MySQL(v5.1) and C language. We store the entire PubMed data in RefMed. The system currently runs on a server of quadcore 2.87GHz with 46M memory, thus cannot support many simultaneous accesses at this point.
 Semantic Network Construction Time Evaluation: We evaluate the time of semantic network construction on queries having results of varying sizes. Table 1 reports the construction time. Our method took less than 0.3 seconds for all queries. On the other hand, in worst case, the naive method took more than 1.5 seconds which is 7 times longer than our method.

Figure 5 illustrates the construction time on an increasing num-ber of concepts. The construction time of POST rapidly increases as the number of concepts increases. On the other hand, our method produces stable construction time. methyltransferase 28,153 99 0.3606 0.1367 Table 1: Network construction time. POST: post processing method; COMPACT: proposed method .
