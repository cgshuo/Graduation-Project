 Item folksonomy or tag information is popularly available on the web now. However, since tags are arbit rary words given by users, they contain a lot of noise such as tag synonym s, semantic ambiguit ies and personal tags . Such noise brings difficulties to improve the accuracy of item recommendations . In this paper, we propose to combine item taxonomy and folksonomy to reduce the noise of t ags and make personalized item recommendations. The experiments conducted on the dataset collected from Amazon.com demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The results suggest ed that the recommendation accuracy can be further improved if we consider the viewpoints and the vocabularies of both experts and users.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval -Information Filtering; H.5.3 [ Info rmation Interfaces and Presentation ]: Group and Organization Interfaces -Collaborative computing Algorithms, Experimentation Recommender Systems, Folksonomy, Tags, Taxonomy Recommender system is an effective tool to deal with the issue of information overload. Besides users  X  item preferences that profiled with explicit or implicit ratings, how to profile users  X  topic preferences is very important [ 1]. Traditionally, the taxonomy or ont ology of items or the content information of items is used to find users  X  topic preferences [1]. Item taxonomy is a set of controlled vocabulary terms or topics designe d to describe or classify items . The advantages of taxonomy include : vocabulary are standard and contro lled, having relationship info rmation among concepts, well recognized as common knowledge , and independent with user communities . One limitation is that it does not reflect users  X  personal viewpoint s or preference s information. Different with item taxonomy, folksonomy is contributed by users. Folksonomy has distinctive advantages which include being given by users explicitly and proactively , reflecting users  X  topic preferences and personal viewpoint s on item descriptions or classification s, having multiple functions such as organiz ing and sharing items, build ing networks, and express ing explicit opinions [6]. It becomes another important information source to find users  X  topic preferences [ 6]. However, since there is no restriction or boundary on selecting words for tagging items, the t ags used by users are free -formed and contain a lot of noise such as semantic ambiguity , tag synonyms and personal tags [ 7] [9] . The tag quality [7] [8] [9] problem generates difficult ies in improving the accuracy of item recommendations based on tags. An important research question is that c an we integrate item folksonomy and taxonomy to overcome the tag quality problem and benefit from both. Some pioneer work discussed how to hybrid taxonomy and folksonomy for knowledge organization [2] and navigation [ 3]. Very few work discussed how to use both information sources to find more accurate user topic preferences and make personalized item recommendations so far . In this paper, we propose to use both item folksonomy and t axonomy to make personalized item recommendation s. Item taxonomy is one important traditional information source to find users  X  topic preferences [1]. The important recommendation app roaches based on item taxonomy include the work of Ziegl er [4]. However, the taxonomic topic weighting approach did not consider the popularity of each taxonomic topic . Currently, the existing recommender systems only used one kind of the two information sources. For example, the recommendation approaches based on item taxonomy [ 4] or tags [ 6]. Very few work discussed how to use both information sources to make personalized item recommendations. Our previous work [5] proposed to convert users  X  preferences to tags into users  X  preferences to taxonomic topics. However the folksonomy vocabulary and users  X  personal viewpoints were not considered to profile users  X  topic preferences and items  X  topic descriptions . In this paper, we focus on the top N item recommendation task . Some key concepts and entities are defined as below.  X  Users: contains all users in an online  X  Items (i.e., Products, Resources):  X  Tags (i.e., Folksonomy) : contains all tags  X  Item Taxonomy: is a set  X  Item taxonomic descriptors: Each item is associated Figure 1 (a) illustrates an example of tagging . For example, user has used the tag and tagged item and . Figure 1 (b) shows an example of item taxonomy. By nature tag s are given by user s to describe their own items . Th e process of finding the personalized semantic meaning s of each tag for each individual user is called tag representation . Definition 1 (Tag Representation) : represents the relevance of each tag to each taxonomic topic and each tag is related to with respect to , the relationship between a tag and a set of taxonomic topics with respect to a user can be defined as the mapping , such tha t . Let denote how strong is related to with respect to , the relationship between a tag and a set of tags with respect to a user can be defined as the mapping such that Fo r a given user and a tag , the strength of being related to a tag for the user can be estimated based on the relevance weight of to the items collected in the tag of the user . Let be calculated as: Where is the item set collected by with tag . How to calculate is very important. Each item is associated with a set of item taxonomic descriptors given by experts. Let item . Suppose a descriptor , inspired by Ziegler  X  s approach [4], we take the structural information of taxonomy into consideration to calculate the weight for in . For the non -leaf topic in the example descriptor given above, can be calculated as : Where is the parent node of topic in , is the number of child nodes of topic . To facilitate comparison , the of the leaf node of the example descriptor , we can get: After resolving Eq uation 3, we c an get the value of (i.e., . Based on the leaf node weight and Eq uation 2 , we c an get the weight of each non -leaf topic in . However, if a topic is popularly used to describe items, it is not a distinctive topic to represent an item. Let denote the inve rse item frequency of topic , we set with in the item set , is an irrational constant approximately equal to 2.7 2 and . Let denotes the number of descriptors of item , the weight can be calculated as: For a given user and a tag , the strength of a tag being related to the tag for the user can be estimated based on the probabilities of being used to tag the items collected in the tag of the user [8]. Let be the number of users tagged with , is th e number of users that have tagged item , the conditional probability of being used to tag item , given the item denoted as can be calculated as Example 1 ( Tag Representation ) The descriptors of the item s in Figure 1 (a) are defined as : , tag representations of tag for and . Personalized semantic meanings of are generated for different users and the semantic ambiguity can be re moved . Similarly, we can get the related taxonomic topics and tags of each personal tag (i.e.,  X  0403  X  ). Moreover , the tag synonym s can be found through comparing th e tag representations. The noise of tags can be reduced. With tag information , e ach item is not only associated with a set of taxonomic topics, but also is described by a set of tags contrib uted by users . The item representation can be defined as : Definition 2 (Item Representation ): represents the relevance of each item to each taxonomic topic and each tag relevant to the taxonomic topic , the relationship between an item and a set of taxonomic topics can be defined as the mapping tag , the relationship between an item and a set of tags can be defined as the mapping , such that , With Equation 4, we can calculate how much item is relevant to taxonomic topic . As discussed in [ 8], the relevance weight Where is the inverse item frequency of tag , is the tag set of , is the user set of , and is the number of unique user -tag pairs of item . Since t he two mappings described by two vectors and . Figure 1 (d) shows an example of item representation of item . We propose to use item taxonomic topics and tags to profile user s X  topic preferences . The user representation is defined as: Definition 3 (User representation): represents each user  X  X  preferences to each taxonomic topic and each tag . Let denote the weight of how much the user is interested in the taxonomic topic , the relationship between a user and a set of taxonomic topics can be defined as the mapping the weight of how much the user is interested in the tag , the relationship between a user and a set of tags can be defined as the mapping . Such that . The user representation of is defined as As there is no explicit rating information available for typical tagging communities [ 6], the binary implicit ratings are used to represent each user  X  s item preferences [6]. To calculate how much will be interested in taxonomic topic and tag , we can firstly calculate how much the user is interested in the tag . As discussed in [ 8], the strength of will be interested in tag can be calculated as , where is the number of items that user has tagged . For a given user and a tag , based on Equation 1, we can get the relevance weight between tag and taxonomic topic for user . Thus, we can estimate each user  X  s preferences to the taxonomic topic through calculat ing the product of and . Let weight can be calculated as: Similarly, the weight can be calculated as: We profile each user with item and topic preferences . Thus, each user can be profiled by three vectors : and Figure 1 (e) shows an example user representation of user . Neighborhood formation is to generate a set of like -minded peers for a target user or a set of similar peer items for an item the more similar neighbor users or items will be found . Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity of any two numeric vectors. The similarity of item preferences of two users is: Thus, the similarity of two users is defined as below: Where and . The similarity of two items can be calculated as: Where . The K nearest neighbor users who have similar user profile s with can be found, which is denoted as . For each target user , a set of candidate items will be generated from the items tagged by 's neighbor users . For the user based collaborative filtering approach, the predictio n score of each candidate item can be calculated as: Where and . For the item based approach, the prediction score can be calculated as: Where and . The experiments were conducted on the dataset collected from Amazon.com. The items are books. To avoid too sparse, we only select those users that have at least 5 items and those items that have been used by at le ast 3 users. The final dataset consists of 4112 u sers, 34201 tags, 30467 items. The taxonomy formed by the descriptors is tree -structured and contains 9919 unique topics. To evaluate the proposed approach es, the dataset was 5 folded and split into 5 datasets. For each split dataset, 80% of users were used as the training user s while 20% of users were randomly selected as the test user s. For each test user, randomly, 20% of the items of this user were hidden as the test /answer set whi le 80% of each user X  X  items are used as his/her training set. If an item in the recommendation list was in the test user's hidden item list, then the item was counted as a hit. The average precision and recall values of the 5 split datasets were used to me asure the accuracy. The results indicated that with 0.8, =0.1, =0.1, =0.3, result s. With =0.3, = 0.3, =0.2, =0.5 , the proposed item based approach had the best results . The following discussions are given on the basis of the best settings of the parameters. We compared the top 3 recommendation precision values of the following approaches :  X  CTR -User and CTR -Item : Th ese are the proposed user and  X  C R -User and T R -User : C R -User is t he proposed user based  X  TPR : Ziegler proposed an approach to acquire a user X  X  topic The top 3 precision values are shown in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, the proposed user based approach CTR -User performed slightly better than the proposed item based approach CTR -Item . Both the combined models performed better than the proposed taxonomy model CR-User and folksonomy model TR-User . Moreover, the proposed taxonomy model CR-User performed better than TPR that is based on Ziegl er  X  s taxonomic topic weighing approach [4]. The improvement suggested that after considering both structural information of item taxonomy and the popularity of taxonomic topics, the accuracy of item recommendations based on item taxonomy can be improved. An other interesting finding is that the proposed folkson omy model TR-User performed much better than the proposed taxonomy model CR-User . It suggest ed that after removing the noise, folkosnomy can be used as quality information to profile users and describe items. In this paper, we proposed to integrate the item taxonomy developed by experts and the item folksonomy contributed by users to make personalized item recommendations. To re duce the noise of tags, we propose to find the related taxonomic topics and tags to represent the personalized semantic meaning of each tag for ea ch individual user . Based on the tag rep resentations, we proposed approaches to find related taxonomic topics and tags to represent the topics of each item and the topic preferences of each user. The experimental results suggest that after removing the noise of tags , the tag information can be u sed as quality user profiling and item content descri bing information source to boost the accuracy of item recommendation s. Moreover, the results also suggest that integrating the standard item taxonomy vocabulary and users X  personal vocabularies as well a s the viewpoint s of both experts and users on item descriptions/classifications can further improve the accuracy of item recommendations.
