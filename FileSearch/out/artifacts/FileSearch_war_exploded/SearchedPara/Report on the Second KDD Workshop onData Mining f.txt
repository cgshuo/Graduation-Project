 Following the success of our first workshop, we organized Data Mining and Audience Intelligence for Advertising, in conjunction with KDD 2008 at Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. This report is a summary of the workshop, including brief descriptions of the accepted papers. The past few years have seen a tremendous growth in online advertising. Especially, the last two years have seen signi f-icant changes in the advertising industry both in terms of business deals as well as new industry initiatives. In 2007 alone, Google bought ad serving company DoubleClick for $3.1B [12], Microsoft bought aQuantive for $6.1B [9] and AdECN [11], WPP snapped up 24/7 Real Media for about $649M [10] and Yahoo paid $680M to retain complete own-ership of Right Media exchange [13]. Since ADKDD 2007, more deals have been announced especially in the area of tar-geted advertising -AOL bought Tacoda for $275M, Yahoo acquired Blue Lithium for $300M and Facebook announced their Beacon targeted advertising system. These, combined with the much publicised effort by Microsoft to buy Yahoo, made 2008 an exciting year for players in the online adver-tising space.
 Apart from exciting business deals, online monetization ha s many challenging problems to solve. Hector Garcia Molina, in his keynote address at WSDM 2008 [18] listed inter-net monetization among the hardest and most impactful problems on the internet. Online advertising is a complex ecosystem involving multiple players, including advertis ers and their agents (ad agencies), publishers and their aggreg a-tors (ad networks), ad exchanges and finally the end users. The primary channels for such online advertisement are paid search [5], content ads [3], display advertisement, ads on other media such as online video (e.g. YouTube) and adver- X  Workshop report on ADKDD 2008: the 2nd International Workshop on Data Mining and Audience Intelligence for Advertising, held in conjunction with KDD 2008, The 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Dis-covery and Data Mining, held at Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, Aug 24-27 2008. about systems that automatically extract product attribut es and attribute values from a product description. For exam-ple, given descriptions of many digital cameras, he details automatic ways to find out what are the attributes of a digi-tal camera ( e.g. megapixel, zoom, etc); now given a specific camera, he finds the values of these attributes (e.g. a Canon SD-550 has 7.1 megapixel and 3x zoom, etc) [7]. Extract-ing this information allows advertisers to quickly automat e their keyword generation and campaign optimization. Sec-ond, he talked about systems which help advertisers achieve specific business goals with advertising. He showed systems that had been used in offline, in-store systems which can be relevant to online advertisement. Seven research papers were accepted to ADKDD 2008. The topics cover several interesting research aspects in onlin e advertising. Following sections give each paper a brief sum -mary. Understanding the empirical behavior of bidders (advertis -ers) in sponsored search auctions is important. First, it al -lows search engines to develop bidding tools, user interfac es and features that help advertisers achieve their goals. Sec -ond, the empirical investigation can guide theoretical mod -eling and analysis of these auctions. The paper with the titl e  X  An Empirical Analysis of Return on Investment Maximiza-tion in Sponsored Search Auctions  X  from Jason Auerbach, Joel Galenson, Mukund Sundararajan tries to understand the bidders X  behavior in terms of whether advertisers are using strategies that maximize their return on investment (ROI) across multiple keywords in sponsored search auc-tions [1]. Since the testing of ROI maximization relies on knowledge of advertisers X  private true values per click, th e authors use some necessary conditions for ROI maximizing behavior which rely only on advertisers X  bids. After classi fy-ing advertisers based on the extent to which they satisfy the test conditions, they conducted a set of analysis over Versi on 1.0 of Yahoo! Search Marketing advertising bidding data , which is provided as part of the Yahoo! Research Alliance Webscope program. Their results indicate that a significant number of advertisers bid almost the same on a large per-centage of keywords; many of them rarely change the bids on their keywords. The final conclusion is that a large fraction of advertisers were unable to maximize their ROI. Online advertising and offline ads seem to be well sepa-rated. However, their impact on users X  daily life is hard to distinguish. Clearly, online advertising can affect user s X  offline behaviors and vice versa. Diane Lambert and Daryl Pregibon X  X  paper  X  Online Effects of Offline Ads  X  proposes a methodology for assessing how ad campaigns in offline me-dia such as print, audio and TV affect online interest in the advertisers brand [16]. As Lambert and Pregibon suggest, online interest can be measured by daily counts of the num-ber of search queries that contain brand related keywords, by the number of visitors to the advertisers web pages, by the number of pageviews at the advertisers websites, or by the total duration of visits to the advertisers website. An increase in outcomes like these in designated market areas (DMAs) where the offline ad appeared suggests heightened Knowing the probability of a click for an advertisement can greatly improve user experience and advertiser revenue in online advertising. However, the probability of a click is u su-ally a function of a large number of variables. Suma Bhat and Kenneth Church investigate a forward selection method to select a subset of variables to better predict the click pr ob-ability in their paper  X  Variable Selection for Ad Prediction  X  [2]. Their forward selection method proceeds sequentially in a way that rewards a set of variables by how much in-formation it provides regarding the outcome, but penalizes the set based on the number of variables in it.By using this method in the context of a logistic regression model, they can provide an estimate of the click-through-rate. Exper-imental results demonstrate the efficacy of their approach, even when compared to a brute force exhaustive search for variable subset selection. The paper  X  Sponsored Ad-Based Similarity: An Approach to Mining Collective Advertiser Intelligence  X  is authored by Jessica Staddon. This paper presents a method for mining the intelligence of advertisers to detect product similari ties and generate accurate recommendations. The basic assump-tion is that if object A and object B each lead to the display of sponsored ad C, then this is an indication of similarity between A and B. With this assumption, Staddon proposes a general framework for leveraging linked advertisements t o detect object similarity. Experimental results show that t he proposed approach yields useful product recommendations. ADKDD 2008 -The Second International Workshop on Data Mining and Audience Intelligence for Advertising was con-ducted in conjunction with KDD 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. Papers presented at this workshop addressed various challenging data mining and machine learning problems in advertising, including analysis of empirical bidding beha v-iors, study of the online effects of offline ads, comparison between organic search and sponsored search, personalized user commercial intention detection, relevance measureme nt between phrase and documents, advertisement click through rate prediction and so on. Participants in this workshop were from top industry and research labs around the world. ADKDD 2008, as we have expected, provided an excellent forum for researchers and industry practitioners in advert is-ing to come together to exchange ideas on this fast growing business. We thank everyone who submitted papers to ADKDD 2008. The high quality of the submissions enabled us to put to-gether a strong technical program. We would like to ex-press our sincere gratitude to all the program committee members for helping us put together a strong research pro-gram, and for their feedbacks and valuable suggestions. The program committee members include: Eugene Agichtein, Rayid Ghani, Tao Hong, Kartik Hosanagar, Rong Jin, Vanja Josifovski, Ramakrishnan Srikant, Ankur Teredesai, Micha el Wellman, Qiang Yang, Yi Zhang. We thank all the partici-pants of this workshop for making this a resounding success. We look forward to doing this again with KDD 2009 in Paris! [15] J. Hu, H.-J. Zeng, H. Li, C. Niu, and Z. Chen.
