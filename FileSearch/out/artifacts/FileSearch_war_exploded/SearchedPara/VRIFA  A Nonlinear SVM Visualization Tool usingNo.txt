 Prediction problems are prevalent in medical domains. For exam-ple, computer-aided diagnosis or prognosis is a key component in a CDSS (Clinical Decision Support System). SVMs, especially SVMs with nonlinear kernels such RBF kernels, have shown supe-rior accuracy in prediction problems. However, they are not favor-ably used by physicians for medical prediction problems because nonlinear SVMs are difficult to visualize, thus it is hard to provide intuitive interpretation of prediction results to physicians. Nomo-gram was proposed to visualize SVM classification models. How-ever, it cannot visualize nonlinear SVM models. Localized RBF (LRBF) kernel was proposed which shows comparable accuracy as the RBF kernel while the LRBF kernel is easier to interpret since it can be linearly decomposed. This paper presents a new tool named VRIFA, which integrates the nomogram and LRBF kernel to pro-vide users with an interactive visualization of nonlinear SVM mod-els. VRIFA graphically exposes the internal structure of nonlinear SVM models showing the effect of each feature, the magnitude of the effect, and the change at the prediction output. VRIFA also per-forms nomogram-based feature selection while training a model in order to remove noise or redundant features and improve the pre-diction accuracy. The tool has been used by biomedical researchers for computer-aided diagnosis and risk factor analysis for diseases. VRIFA is accessible at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/vrifa .

X  Corresponding Author Introduction: Prediction problems are prevalent in medical do-mains. For example, computer-aided diagnosis or prognosis is a key component in a CDSS (Clinical Decision Support System). SVMs, especially SVMs with nonlinear kernels (e.g., RBF ker-nels), have shown superior accuracy in prediction problems. How-ever, they are not favorably used by physicians for medical predic-tion problems because nonlinear SVMs are difficult to visualize, thus it is hard to provide intuitive interpretation of prediction re-sults to physicians.

Nomogram was proposed to visualize SVM classification mod-els [5, 4]. However, it cannot visualize nonlinear SVM models. Localized RBF (LRBF) kernel was proposed in [3], which shows comparable accuracy as the RBF kernel while the LRBF kernel is easier to interpret since it can be linearly decomposed. A previous study showed that the LRBF is less sensitive to noise features than the RBF while the LRBF degrades the prediction accuracy more when important features are eliminated.

This paper presents a new tool, VRIFA, which integrates the nomogram and LRBF kernel to provide users with an interactive vi-sualization of nonlinear SVM models, by which physicians can in-tuitively examine the results of computer-aided diagnosis and per-form risk factor analysis. VRIFA trains an SVM model with LRBF kernel integrated with an easy-using interface where users can ad-just and observe the effect of each feature, the magnitude of the ef-fect, and the change at the prediction output. VRIFA also performs the nomogram-based feature selection while training a model, thus physicians can observe highly ranked features and easily analyze high risk factors for a disease.

We developed VRIFA with the following functions:
The user first inputs a dataset file, and the file must be format-ted as in the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository and Statlog dataset [2]. Some of medical dataset files can be down-loaded from the LIBSVM X  X  site [1]. VRIFA uses the file format of LIBSVM.

Fig. 1 shows a screen shot of the tool: on the top are the selected file and user options. The parameter tuning is enabled by check-ing the checkbox " C and Gamma Tuning". C and Gamma are the parameters of SVM classifier and LRBF kernel respectively. In the right side of the selected training file, there is a progress bar that shows the progress of the grid search process for parameter selec-tion. Users can press button  X  X ancel X  to stop the search (the Cap-tion of the button  X  X rain X  is changed to  X  X ancel X  when it is clicked). Then the best parameter values from starting to the stop point will be chosen.
 VRIFA Demonstration: In this section, we will demonstrate the prediction and visualization functions of VRIFA using the Pima in-dians diabetes datasets from the UCI repository which includes 768 samples (268 positives and 500 negatives) with 8 features: Number of times pregnant; Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test; Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg); Tri-ceps skin fold thickness (mm); 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml); Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m) 2 ); Diabetes pedigree function; Age (years).
 Users can input the dataset file by clicking the button "Training File" as seen in Fig. 1. The VRIFA X  X  GUI supports users with the following functions: Radio buttons to choose the kernel type; Radio buttons to choose whether to run the feature selection or not; A check button to choose whether to tune the parameters or not (if not, default values will be used).

Fig. 1 shows the result: The upper left box of the tool shows the range of effect values for all 8 features. The longer the line, the more the impact the feature has on the prediction probability. The second feature has the most impact on the prediction result. The up-per right box of the tool shows the effect of each feature  X  how the Log OR value of the feature changes as the feature value changes. It currently shows feature 3 with feature value 60 and the Log OR value 0.2. Note that there is a nonlinear relationship between the feature value and the Log OR. The sum of Log OR of each feature determines the final prediction probability of the patient, which is drawn in the bottom left corner of the tool. The Log OR sum is ap-proximately 0.5 which corres ponds to the proba bility 0. 6168. The user can adjust the feature value using the scroll bar in the center right side. The Log OR of the feature will change accordingly as well as the final probability while the scroll bar changes.
Fig. 2 shows a screen shot of the VRIFA visualizing the clas-sification results on the diabetes dataset with LRBF kernel and the feature selection enabled . The bottom right graph shows the predic-tion accuracy at each subset number of features. The best number of features is 6 (the subset of features {1,2,3,6,7,8}) that gives the highest accuracy = 0.7799. The user can select one of the feature to see the impact of the feature on the prediction result. Feature 1 is selected in Fig. 2, and the upper right box shows the effect of the feature on the prediction output.
 Implementation and Limitations: VRIFA has been implemented as a standalone Windows application. The application was pro-grammed in Visual C#.NET 2005 and used the .NET LIBSVM for the SVM implementation. Users need to install Microsoft .NET Framework to run VRIFA. VRIFA is accessible at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/vrifa .

The main limitation of VRIFA is that VRIFA needs a decompos-able (summation) kernel which does not provide information about feature interaction . Thus, VRIFA cannot visualize the interaction effect between features. Another limitation is the slow speed of grid search when running the parameter selection, which is due to the slow convergence for some difficult cases (e.g. C is large). Ef-ficient parameter selection for SVM is an ongoing research topic in the machine learning community. [1] LIBSVM. http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/  X  cjlin/libsvm/. [2] A. Asuncion and D. Newman.
