 It has been two decades since the great paradigm shift in mach ine translation toward the use of statistical methods, that is, automatical ly learning trans-lation rules between two languages from large collections o f translated text. These two decades have seen a rapid evolution from the origin al word-based models proposed by IBM researchers to phrase-based models a nd now to meth-ods that use formal grammars with linguistic annotation. Th e use of statistical methods, together with growing availability of data in the w orld X  X  languages, has lowered the barrier of entry for researchers to work on ne w languages. While the majority of commercial machine translation syste ms have been built for European languages, two Asian languages have received s pecial attention by the statistical machine translation community: Chinese and Arabic. But increasingly, attention is also being focused on other Asia n languages such as Japanese, Korean, Thai, Urdu, and Hindi. Many research grou ps throughout Asia are extremely active contributors to machine translat ion research. several articles describing significant approaches to chal lenges faced in apply-ing statistical machine translation methods to Asian langu ages. While these articles can hardly represent the vast field of current work, they neverthe-less constitute some of the landmarks on the broad path of pro gress toward improving machine translation for Asian languages. The con tribution by He et al. describes the application of a fairly language-indep endent method to improve Asian language translation. It addresses a current hot topic, the combination of outputs from several disparate machine tran slation systems to generate a single output possessing the strengths of all t he individual sys-tems. They describe their very successful approach, which e arned the top spot in the 2008 NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation of Chin ese-to-English translation.
 pairs, especially pairs of very distant languages, has prov en that language translation can be addressed only up to a certain point by a on e-size-fits-all approach. Different language pairs pose different problem s. The contribution by Ma and Way deals with an issue particular to translation wh ere Chinese is a source language, that of detecting word boundaries, which are not e xplicit in Chinese writing. The contribution by Venkatapathy and Ba ngalore tackles issues particular to translation where Hindi is a target language: namely, its starkly different word order and rich morphology compared t o English. They apply a discriminatively-trained model to meet these chall enges. Finally, the contribution by Tsunakawa et al. studies the case when both source and target languages are Asian languages. They show that translation f rom Chinese to Japanese (which are unrelated to each other) can benefit from using English as a pivot language, allowing them to utilize more bilingual resources. chine translation, were selected from a pool of 13 submitted articles.
