 Generally, web information search is defined as a process of searching for web re-sources holding desirous information. For information search, a user utilizes informa-tion portal search engines or specific site-dependent engines, or searches for informa-tion by clicking hyperlinks by oneself. These search results are heterogeneous web resources, which need to be compared to get more precise results. 
As e-commerce search systems, various search engines and evaluation systems with methods of limited product information search or product category base are currently available [1,2]. But the Boston Consulting Group says that 48% of all users have experienced not being able to satisf actorily search a desired product and 28% of all product purchase tryouts could not reach purchase because of research failure [3]. 
The main causes of dissatisfactory search are as follows. (1) Most product informa-tion search engines cannot reflect a user X  X  search intent exactly because of their key-word-based search method. (2) Product information evaluation cannot reflect a user X  X  real preference completely. (3) Most product information search engines and evalua-tion systems are developed as lower applications of shopping sites, and each shopping site has its own search service, criteria for evaluating search results, and product clas-sification category [4]. Brand new technologies of Web Services and Semantic Web will furnish existing Internet-based applications with new opportunities. Especially, product information search and comparison systems in e-commerce will become killer applications. 
Web Services technologies will provide smart alternatives on developing meta-search engines in product information search and comparison fields. Amazon.com offers Web Services technologies, and an increasing number of shopping sites will follow. These sites will facilitate the development of meta-search engines. 
Although structured product information is extracted easily by Web Services, there classification and terminology to represent its product information. Ontology mapping technology will be utilized to resolve this problem [6], and researches on adopting this product information search technology have been progressing [7,8] 
To search and compare product information, we developed ProMetas with three methodologies based on the Web Services, Semantic Web, and Ontology mapping technologies: (1) the configuration of a user X  X  search purpose, (2) Product Category mapping, and (3) multi-attribute-based product information scoring. Along with the development of Web Services and Semantic Web, there will be an increasing number of shopping malls providing not only information about their prod-ucts through the web services but also taxonomy with RDF, OWL, etc. such as the Open Directory Project [9]. Each Web Services X  WSDL is described in each shopping mall, and Meta Search Engine can search and use appropriate Web Services. So if a shopping mall X  X  product classification taxonomy, which is described with Semantic Web languages, can be mapped to the product classification taxonomy of ProMetas , it can get all structured product information within the matched category of each shopping mall. 
Under this environment, ProMetas can search and compare product information by not only selecting product classifications but also inputting product attributes. We will, therefore, suggest a meta-search and comparison framework ProMetas consist-ing of three main modules (See Fig. 1).

In ProMetas , a user inputs his or her search intent in a structured format to the In-terface . Then, the Product Search Broker transforms the user X  X  configured product category into the product category of each shopping mall and requests the product information to shopping malls through Web Services. The Product Evaluation Agent evaluates and compares the results, and shows a user the list of selected products with ranking, attributes, and their values. In this section, we explain the three product information search methodologies for ProMetas : Configuration of a User X  X  Search Intent and Preference, Product Classifi-cation Mapping, and Product Information Evaluation. 3.1 The Configuration of a User X  X  Search Purpose To grasp user X  X  intent accurately and reflect relative importance of each attribute, we suggest a personalized product search intent and preference representation methodol-ogy, which explains user's search intent by inputting three kinds of information (search context, feature/attribute information, and relative importance). First, a user selects the desired product (Search Context) from the categories of ODP, input attribute name of selected category, attribute value, measurement unit and range operator (Feature Information), and indicate one X  X  own weight of attributes. 
Feature information consists of four terms: attribute name, value, measurement unit, and operator. The attribute name and value fields are mandatory and the others are optional. We formally denote feature information as a set notation {attribute, value, measurement unit, range operator} and call this ADS (Attribute Description Set). Fur-thermore, each ADS should have a different weight of importance in user X  X  purchase decision making. To reflect the different weight of each attribute, we also allow a user to express preference by assigning an appropriate relative weight to each ADS. 3.2 Product Category Mapping After configuring a user X  X  search purpose, a product information request is made to the Web Services of shopping malls. However, there are some remaining problems. Each shopping mall has its unique product classification. So, to find the product cate-gory in a taxonomy most relevant to a given product category from a different taxon-omy, we implement three consecutive steps. (1) Since each term that appears in the category path usually has various semantics, we narrow the consideration range of semantics of each term by using the product category hierarchy information. Also, since different terms can have the same semantics, we expand a given term to a set of synonyms. Both tasks basically use WordNet. (2) The second step collects prospec-tive categories from the taxonomy of a product information provider by a proposed filtering procedure based on the product category information preprocessed in the previous step. (3) The last step evaluates the relevancy of each prospective category using a similarity measure and chooses the product category most relevant to the category provided by a user. Then we can have a set of alternative products that reside in the chosen category of a specific Internet shopping mall. 3.3 Multi-attribute-Based Product Information Scoring Methodology Multi-Attribute-Based Product Information Scoring Methodology evaluates all prod-uct information of the selected Category by Product Category Mapping Methodology through Web Services, and consists of two steps: (1) to select the product information suitable for each attribute and (2) evaluate the product information with the method. formation. If there are ADS attribute names used in XML tag, the tag values are ex-tracted. Otherwise, if there are no matched names, values are extracted by data type, unit, or ADS attribute value. 
In the next step, the similarity calculation module integrates every distance of the attributes to calculate the similarity of each product. We used a general similarity calculation method to evaluate the products. The customer X  X  priorities for each attrib-ute are changed to attribute weights. We calculated the weighted sum of distances with the distances and weights of every attribute. Finally, we ranked products by their similarities to the customer X  X  configuration. We developed the ProMetas prototype of intelligent shopping malls using Web Ser-vices and category ontology with the information from Buy.com. We also used the Web Services of Amazon.com, and constructed a category ontology with the informa-tion from Amazon.com. Therefore, users can search for and compare products at Amazon.com and Buy.com with ProMetas . We implemented ProMetas depicted in Fig. 1 into a working prototype using Java. Fig. 2 shows an illustrative screen of the main window of the prototype system. 
For comparison and evaluation of ProMetas , we built product category taxonomies of Amazon.com and Buy.com. Table1 shows a comparison of search results from ProMetas with keyword-based search results from the shopping malls. 
ProMetas needs to input just one search condition and it gets 100% result. With existing product search engines, sometimes even 4 user inputs cannot produce satis-factory results. Without a direct visit to the existing shopping mall sites, ProMetas can assist users with purchase decision-making. Moreover, it is very convenient to keyword-based search trials to acquire accurate results. On the other hand, there was no attempt to prove that ProMetas system was more accurate and efficient than the traditional keyword-based meta-search engines because the experiment was limited. The experiment only presented an example of a better result. We are planning to con-duct a more precise experiment to prove the advantages of the ProMetas system. We proposed a semantic web-based personalized product meta-search agent approach to achieve two important and complementary goals: (1) allow users more expressive power in utilizing their Web searches for products, and (2) improve the relevancy of search results based on the user X  X  real purchase intent. In contrast to the previous research, we focused not only on the search problem itself, but also on the decision-making problem that motivates users to search the Web. Our contributions are briefly summarized as follows. 
First, we proposed a product search intent representation scheme through which users could express their real search intent by specifying domain-specific product search context, expressing feature information of products using ADS concept, and assigning appropriate weights to each ADS concept. Second, to enhance the precision of the retrieved information, we presented a hybrid rating mechanism which considers both the user X  X  search intent represented by the context information, that is, category path, and the user X  X  search preference represented by a multi-ADS list and the corre-sponding weights. Third, we designed and implemented a meta-search agent system called ProMetas that cooperates with WordNet for con cept retrieval, and with most well-known internet shopping malls such as Amazon.com and Buy.com for electronic goods. This open and extensible architecture will allow new Internet shopping malls to be incorporated into ProMetas at any time. For the empirical validation of our approach, we already empirically validated our approach for some limited cases, and we are also doing some real world experiments of our system. Acknowledgement.
