 Based on a comparative study of cooperative work practices at two oncology clinics, the paper shows that work practices across these otherwise comparable settings vary significantly. Asking, h ow can ethnographic studies of local work practices then provide a dependable basis for design, the paper discusses how we may conceive of the relationship between ethnographic studies and systems development and suggests that a way out of the dilemma migh t be found in developing an analysis of the  X  X igher -order X  practices of endless combination and recombination of artifacts, formats, notations, etc. that are found across such sites.

Even within the same ge n eral work domain, from one setting to the next, we find conspicuous variations in the division of labor, in the methods and techniques used, etc. And what is more, we of course also find that work practices evolve over time, chan g ing in r e sponse to all kinds of developments. But how do we, in a design context, handle this almost bewildering vari a tion? Are practices as malleable as warm wax? Can work practices, as the proponents of  X  X usiness process reengineering X  will have us believe, be designed in a st rong sense, i.e., in the sense of designing a car engine? This set of issues, which has been a key concern to CSCW for many years, is perhaps particularly acute in the general area of health care informatics. Marc Berg, for example, argues that health care ,  X  X yp i fied by a complexity that defies the predictability and standardization required for simple reengineering X   X  X s fund a-mentally unfit for a planning and controlling a p proach X . No agency can design  X  integrated care delivery systems X  that  X  X it X  and can t hen be  X  X olled out X  [4]. Hence, in this area at least, systems development has to be treated as an open and distributed process. On the other hand, Ellingsen and Monteiro argue that, with int e-grated health care systems cutting across multiple local setting s and disciplines, the que s tion of how to account for the variations of work practices in standardized information systems becomes virulent:  X  X t is neither practically nor analytically feasible to fine -tune design to all local settings X  [10].
 These and oth er studies [e.g., 9; 14; 11] show that health care work is intensely collaborative, whether co -located or spatially distributed; it requires collaboration between different profe s-sional groups and experts from different disciplines, e x change of data with i nstitutions providing examinations and treatment like lab o ratories and pharmacies, and so forth. Variations in work practices and document a tion systems may occur for all sorts of reasons; and documentation is a multi -purpose activity, serving different pu r poses, such as information exchange, accountability, and workflow management. Even what is thought of as  X  X nform a-tion exchange X  is not a clear -cut activity but involves the interpr e-tation of data from a clinical perspective as well as from the pe r-spective of the organiz a tion of work. This leads to the more general issues that will be raised and ill u-minated in this paper: What exactly are the work practices for which collaborative technologies and systems are to be deve l oped and adapted? For the purposes of design, what is the status of work practices as uncovered and described by ethnographic stu d-ies? How do we, in a specific setting, identify the features of e x-is t ing work practices that are, in a sense, essential to that setting and thus should not be tamp ered with or disrupted but rather  X  X u p-ported X ? And, conversely, how do we identify those features that may be merely accidental and transient? And how do we do so systematically? How do we generalize from studies of local pra c-tices to the design of systems for general use in the domain? And how do we infer from studies of local practices to the design of systems supposed to cut across and integrate heterogeneous pra c-tices? Or is the notion of workplace studies as a kind of advanced  X  X  e-quirements analysis X  for  X  X ystems development X  in the traditional model (analysis -design -implementation -appropriation) proble m-atic for such complex and widely ramified settings as those of modern health care? Should we, instead of focusing on sp e cific practices in local settin gs, attempt to identify recurring features in those widely varying practices? We approach these questions through a comparative analysis of collaborative work practices in two oncology clinics. The study upon which we base our anal y sis includes three clin ics: ONC1, ONC2, and ONC3, each part of large comm u nity hospitals in Au s tria and comprising several wards, an outp a tient, and a day clinic. ONC1, ONC2, and ONC3 have a computerized patient i n-formation system that dates back to the 1970 X  X  and only co n tains basic administrative data. The main source of i n formation about patients at ONC1 and ONC2 is the paper -based patient r e cord. By contrast, ONC3 has a home -made oncology information sy s tem which supports documenting, ordering, and scheduling, from a r-ranging appoin t ments to ordering chemotherapies and lab tests, to writing the discharge letter. Out of this web of clinics and wor k-places we here focus on the outpatient and day clinics of ONC1 and ONC3.
 The aim of fieldwork in the clinics was to better understand the complexity of work practices. Our general focus was on docume n-tation practices tightly connected to the coordination of tasks b e-tween individuals and organiz a tional units. A more specific focus was on the artifacts used and on the setting, i.e., the m aterial se t-ting with its arrangements of rooms, computers, and other mat e-rial r e sources. The field work involved participant observation, document analysis, and initial and supplementary interviews. Oncology work is the provision of treatment against tumors. The work that is b e ing done in the clinics under study, as is often the case with oncology clinics, can be said to roughly consist in the administering of chemotherapy, in multiple c y cles, and the taking of blood tests for the purpose of m onitoring the state of the p a-tient. Chemotherapies are based on hundreds of clinical protocols, with specifications of combinations of drugs and cycles. Ch e-motherapies often need to be supported by complementary inte r-ventions, such as surgery or radiation treatment, which, in the se t-tings at hand, are delivered by other clinical departments at the same hospitals.
 That is, the clinical work performed at the two settings is esse n-tially the same. There is, of course, great variation from one p a-tient to the nex t, related to the kind of cancer and the severity of the illness, and hence to the specific chem o therapy protocol and the developing state of the patient. The variations we find from one clinic to the next, however, do not stem from delivery of di f fe r ent t herapies.
 Oncology work in these clinics can be conceived of as the deli v-ery of care at three levels of intervention, represented by the ou t-patient clinic, the day clinic, and the ward. Patients will visit the outpatient clinic for clin i cal examinations b efore, during and after treatment. That is, they will visit the clinic for the purposes of planning and monitoring therapy (or if they have acute problems). Patients are referred to the outpatient clinic by general practitioners or sp e cialists, with a more or less specific que s tion. A diagnosis has already been formulated and patients will now seek advice as regards therapy; or equivocal laboratory results make doctors su s pect an oncology or hematology problem and the doctor will then send the patient to th e clinic for clarific a-tion. Some patients are referred from other hospitals, e.g., after breast su r gery, with the question as to whether they need after -treatment or, in case they are metastasized, what kind of treatment they need. At the outp a tient clinic , decisions are furthermore taken as to how to further proceed with a patient and if s/he is sent to other departments or further examinations. In the course of this, all kinds of clinical examinations are performed, from auscult a-tion to physical examinati on and biopsies. Blood samples are ro u-tinely taken and sent to the laboratory for analysis. The day clinic and the wards, by contrast, are where the trea t-ments are actually delivered. Patients are admitted to the day clinic for chemotherapy and other inf u sion therapies that last a few hours; and for some treatments that may last for a couple of days they will be hospitalized in one of the wards.
 Oncology work involves massive paperwork. As suggested above, cancer treatment typically requires lengthy therap y, delivered in multiple cycles, acco m panied by regular check -ups before, during, and after therapy. All these intera c tions need to be carefully documented so that they can be reproduced at later stages. Fu r-thermore, oncology work is safety -critical work. Patients are given a g gressive chemicals with taxing and possibly damaging side -effects. All clinical measures taken thus have to be carefully recorded. On top of that, although the clinics under study are sp e-cialized units devoted to chemotherapy and assoc iated clinical i n-terventions, oncology is highly interdisciplinary. As also noted above, the clinics need to cooperate with other clinical specialties, such as departments of surgery, urology, and gynecology; with radiology, nuclear medicine, and the labor atory; as well as with the pharmacy and radiotherapy. In short, the clinics are embedded in a network of institutions and have to maintain relationships with them, and keeping track of and recording the various r e-quests and results that are exchanged is a crucial issue. And f i-nally, the oncology clinics under study have a considerable and increasing throughput of p a tients. In ONC1, for example, one of the clinics included in this study, there are 4.500 to 5.000 admi s-sions to the wards per year, plus 5.500 t o 6.000 patients in the day clinic, and about 10.000 visits to the outpatient clinic. The sheer volume of care being delivered of course only e x acerbates the load of documentation work. As a result, the documentation work of the clinics is arduous work. Work is organized differently in ONC1 and ONC3. In ONC1, the outpatient clinic and the day clinic are located separately and function largely independently of each other: they have their own staff and admission procedures, with separat e r e ception counters, but they share a small laboratory for blood tests. In ONC3, the outpatient and day clinics are in the same space with a shared r e-ception counter for admissions, and they also share pe r sonnel. On the other hand, ONC3 does not have its own lab, and patients therefore have to wait from one to two hours for their lab results. For this reason, doctors at ONC3 often recommend patients to have blood tests done the day before at some external laboratory. First of all, the work organization dif fers significantly. The outp a-tient clinic of ONC1 is staffed by three to four nurses, as well as one or two doctors. Blood tests are taken by an intern, who also records the medical history of new patients, if r e quired. There is a division of labor between the nurses but it is not fixed; in fact, they take turns at the different tasks ( X  X otate X ). One is responsible for the counter, receiving patients, checking what has to be done and arranging whatever is necessary. A n other nurse is taking care of preparing blood tests, i.e.,  X  X oing the blood X , as the nurses call it. And a third nurse is  X  X t the back X , in the next room where the folders with all the patient documents are stored. That is, what the nurses do at the outpatient clinic of ONC1 is not really care gi v-ing, but rather administrative tasks. Most of the time they are busy mana g ing the workflow. This includes providing the doctors with the information they need and keeping them up to date, i.e., tasks that have a lot to do with document a tion.
 The outpati ent clinic at ONC3 is staffed by a secretary at the r e-ception counter and three -four teams consisting of one doctor and one nurse who work closely together in the consult a tion rooms. Sometimes, a nurse is responsible for assisting two doctors and she will then be constantly moving between two rooms. Also in contrast to ONC1, all of the nurses at ONC3 are engaged in r e-questing blood tests and checking for results from the laboratory. The workflows of the two outpatient clinics differ as well. At the ONC3 out patient clinic, patients arrive by appointment (except in cases of emergency). Patients arrive with an appoin t ment sheet ( Wiederbestellung ), and perhaps also external lab r e sults. At the counter, the secretary receives the p a tients, checks if they are at t he right place, retrieves the patient folder, checks if all necessary information is available, and sends the patient on to one of the co n sultation rooms or to have blood taken. At ONC1 patients do not have to make appointments but can d e-cide for the m selv es when they want to come, i.e., if they are sent by their family doctors they can just go to the outpatient clinic immediately. Instead of an appointment sheet, the p a tient arrives with his/her patient diary ( Patiententagebuch ) and possibly also external lab results, to be received by a nurse who fetches the p a-tient folder from the archive, checks if all relevant information is available, takes care of administration (by means of the admini s-trative information system), enters services in the care sheet ( Pf legeblatt ), sends the patient along to have blood taken or d i-rectly to one of the consult a tion rooms, and places the patient folder wherever it is needed next, namely, at the  X  X lood work place X  where a nurse prepares the tubes, or in the consultation room.
 The workflow at ONC1 also has its routine exceptions. Patients sometimes do have to come at a certain date. This would be pa r-ticularly important if the patient has had a certain chem o therapy, for example, and the blood count is supposed to change on a pa r-ticular day after therapy. Some patients also may ask their doctor for an appointment, and the doctor will then announce the a p-pointment with the patient at the outpatient clinic. Nurses keep a special paper calendar for these few cases. Likewise, for som e p a-tients the nurse at the counter will call one of the doctors on duty on the ward to see this particular patient.
 And as suggested above, the collaborative arrangements between nurses and doctors are also significantly different in the two cli n-ics. In ONC1, it is the doctor alone who sees the patient. S/he will look through the documents in the folder, checking results from different kinds of tests, and take a decision about the next step to take. S/he writes the next appointment, e.g., a reg u lar examin ation after, say, about three months ( X  X id June X ), into the patient X  X  diary and hands it over to the patient. When the patient has left, the do c-tor dictates a short progress report into a dictaphone. If any imm e-diate measures are planned, the patient takes the updated care sheet back to the nurse at the counter who then takes care of the doctor X  X  orders, e.g., for lab tests.
 In ONC3, where doctors and nurses work closely together, the doctor usually asks p a tients about his or her condition and looks through the examination results that are attached to the folder. At the same time, the doctor looks up the patient in the oncology sy s-tem where a list of previous visits appears. The doctor may add a new diagnosis and other information on the status of the patien t, order ch e motherapies or blood tests, plan admission to one of the wards, add medication, print out prescriptions, and finally enter the date for the next appoin t ment and print out the appointment sheet, which they hand over to the patient. When the pati ent has left, the doctors enters a short  X  X rogress note X  in the oncology sy s-tem. In the meantime, the nurse makes phone calls to make a p-pointments, prints out examination results, makes phot o copies, checks if blood results are available, and so forth. She takes orders from the doctor directly, to arrange for any immediate service, but she also pr o vides information, either directly or through post -it notes and various annot a tions.
 The work at the day clinics, where chemotherapies are admini s-tered, does not d iffer as much as the work in the outp a tient clinics. In ONC1, the patient arrives at the day clinic by appointment, ca r-rying his or her  X  X  a tient diary X . The nurse has already, normally the day before, entered the relevant information in a specific paper fo rm which can be dubbed  X  X he day schedule X . It specifies diagn o-ses, specific blood tests, and planned therapies for each patient of that day. Patient labels with ID codes (in the form of stickers that are put on the sheet) are used to identify the patients.
 All patients who receive a chemotherapy have to do a blood count immediately before it is administered. This is a small test that can be done directly at ONC1, in the laboratory. This is a simple test that can be done immediately at ONC1, in the local la b. The nurse checks the blood values and, depending on the result, co n firms the ordered chemotherapy or sends the patient to the doctor for him or her to d e cide. An intern, together with the nurse, administers the infusions. They both confirm the delivery with their signatures on the chemothe r-apy order or on the therapy sheet that lists all other infusions r e-ceived by a patient. Both documents also contain the signatures of the doctors who ordered the therapies.
 One doctor is present at the day clinic to s ee patients, not only if their blood values are inappropriate or other problems occur, but also for check -ups during therapy. In ONC3, a similar routine is followed, the main difference being that patients have to wait one to two hours for lab results (un less they brought results from an external clinic). Chemotherapies are ordered by the doctors from the oncology information system; that is, they do not need to send signed ordering sheets to the pha r-macy. However, an ordering form is printed out from the system and used by the nurses to prepare infusions. Other key documents used are, again, the list of appointments and the appointment sheet. In addition the nurse at the day clinic maintains a handwri t-ten list of all patients in the order of their arrival that represents the current workflow, e.g., if the admission has already been co m-pleted for a patient. This list is placed on the desk to be seen and updated by the nurses. Let us now look at documentation work in both oncology clinics from a coordin a tion point of view. Ordering the patient flow : At the end of their consultation with a do c tor at ONC3, patients receive a print -out of the appointment sheet for their next visit, a copy of which is stored in the patient folder. When they arrive at the a p pointed date they carry this sheet with them. After having checked everything, the secr e tary will clip this appointment sheet to the patient folder and place it in the co n sultation room to which the patient is ass igned to signal that the patient has a r rived.
 Figure 1. ONC3: Appointment sheet ( left ), and List of a p-pointments ( right ). On this particular list the head doctor has tabulated the number of patients assigned to the three do c tors on duty that day.
 The app ointment sheet (Figure 1) provides the date and purpose of the appointment, and what the p a tient will have to provide (e.g., results from a blood test). However, it is primarily written in a way to support the work of the doctors and nurses, e.g., it gives only abbreviations for the planned services, like #CBA for  X  X h e-motherapy blood acute X  meaning that the patient will receive a chem o therapy that day. It is also, of course, produced to inform the secretary, when the patient arrives for the next visit of th e p a-tient, as well as the family doctor.
 The appointment sheet is central for the doctors in a consultation and they o f ten look at it first. It tells them about what is to be done that day. It lists all the diagnoses, past therapies (with dates), and the d etails of current measures, inclu d ing additional medication. During a consultation doctors may turn to the appoin t ment sheet to get a quick overview of the current state and the course of the treatment.
 The list of appointments gives an overview of oncolog y patients for a partic u lar day. The list is generated the day before by one of the doctors, usually the head doctor, who assigns patients to the doctors on duty, distributing them evenly and trying to ensure that patients are seen by a doctor with whom th ey are fami l iar. It is about six pages long, listing all patients with appointments, planned a c tivities, and responsible doctors. It is photocopied (up to 10 times) and distri b uted. The responsible for blood tests uses the list the day before for preparati ons (tubes for blood tests with stic k ers, printing out of orders, etc.). The nurse in the consultation room uses it for prepa r ing print -outs of lab results; she annotates the list with remarks and stickers, hig h lighting special needs (e.g.,  X  X enflon X ). In ONC1, the information on the appointment sheet of ONC3, is distri b uted over several artifacts. The  X  X atient diary X  is the first source of inform a tion about what needs to be done with a patient who arrives at the outpatient clinic, but if the p a tient, for instance, has forgotten the diary, the nurse will consult the progress notes or even the discharge letter from the ward, or will infer the purpose from the fact, say, that one week after a chemotherapy a routine blood count has to be done. Once she has fou nd out what needs to be done, she proceeds to the patient administration system and then makes a note of the request for ser v ices on the care sheet in the p a tient folder and checks if relevant results are there. Figure 2. ONC1: Care sheet.
 Care sheets a re easy to identify as they are blue (in contrast to all other documents in the folders). They are central for the organiz a-tion of the workflow at ONC1. In the left column the current date is entered with a stamp. In the main column ( X  X lood, other, e x-amina tions/appointments X ) the planned interventions are doc u-mented. The last column is used to initial the entry. The care sheet serves multiple functions. First, specific inform a-tion about what needs to be done with the patient (e.g., the kind of blood test) will be noted on the care sheet. This is needed, for e x-ample, by the nurse at the  X  X lood wor k place X  who has to issue the request to the labor a tory and prepare labeled tubes. Second, nurses also document on the care sheet the condition of a patient or speci al inc i dents. Most importantly, they see the care sheet as providing them with an ove r view which would otherwise not be available:  X  X o make it manageable for us [...], because in the physician X  X  document a tion it is not always included in the way we want i t, or these documents are not always available when we need them. [...] so that we can accurately orient ou r selves according to what was arranged when, where, how, and with whom X  (OBS3, p. 8). Finally the care sheet is som e times the only means to document the visit of a patient, for instance when a patient comes only for having blood taken without b e ing seen by a doctor.
 Constructing the patient record : In ONC1, the main source of inform a tion about a patient in the outpatient or day clinic is the patient f older. All reports generated as a result of the patients X  vi s-its (medical documentation, lab and other r e sults) are collected in the patient folder. The folders of all patients who have vi s ited the outpatient clinic in the current or preceding year are sto red in the a r chive located in a small room behind the counter (Figure 3). Older folders are l o cated in the basement. In ONC3, there is a similar rule for keeping folders, but older fol d ers are copied on microfiche and then d e stroyed. At ONC1 each patient folder has a unique identifier: a simplified version of the patient label with ba r code, as well as the date of birth (day/month) and the first letter of the patient X  X  name (Figure 4); and each document in it carries the patient label. The most r e-cent progr ess note always appears as first page. Figure 3. ONC1: Archive of patient folders.
 At ONC3 patient folders are organized by the patient ID, i.e., the number p a tients receive at their first visit at the outpatient and day clinic. The seque n tial number (t he last part of the ID, that serially numbers the patients for each year) is noted on the folders and used to bring them into a consecutive order.
 Locating folders is one of the main tasks for the nurses in the ou t-patient cli n ic of ONC1. For each patient w ho comes to the clinic, or requests information from the doctor by phone, they have to provide the corresponding folder. Another task is updating  X  co l-lecting all the new data (e.g., test results signed off by a phys i cian or discharge letters co m ing from o ne of the wards) that have been generated. For this, nurses at ONC1 use an intermed i ary folder which is black and organized by date of birth, from where these items are transferred to the patient folders later. Although most of the patient information at ONC3 can be found in the onco l ogy system, most documents are normally printed out and kept in the paper folder. The secretary uses the list of a p-pointments to retrieve the folders of p a tients the day before and arranges them in piles for each of the doctor s. When a patient a r-rives, the folder is transferred to another pile (that of the current patients), and from time to time the secretary distributes the co l-lected fol d ers to the doctors. Figure 4. Stacks of patient folders at ONC1 ( left ) and ONC3 ( right ).
 In both clinics, the folders of patients who have arrived are org a-nized in stacks, but again in slightly different ways. At ONC1, p a-tient folders are physically a r ranged in significant places, either at the  X  X lood workplace X , where a nurse pr e pares tube s, or in the consultation room with their positions indicating seque n tial order (of the patients to be seen) and work load. Some of them have post -it -notes indicating a special arrangement (e.g.,  X  X at.calls X   X  patient calls). At ONC3, p a tient folders are p hysically arranged close to the doctor X  X  desk in the consult a tion room in the order in which patients will arrive. The nurse attaches the latest report to the front sheet.
 Figure 5. ONC1: Order form for chemotherapies.
 Ordering and recording clinical dec isions: Some documents are produced and updated by the doctor during consultation. A f ter having talked to a patient the doctor at ONC1 writes the next a p-pointment, e.g., a reg u lar examination after three months, into the p a tient X  X  diary and hands it over t o the patient. When the patient has left, the doctor dictates a short progress report into a dict a-phone which is later on typed by a secretary. It is a cumulative Word document that is regularly u p dated and printed out for each update. It is the first docu ment to be found in the patient folder, with the page with the most current note on top. For ordering chemother a pies doctors use a special form (Figure 5). It has a header with the name of the clinic and head doctor and another one designating the type of drug  X  e.g.,  X  X inorelbin (Teilbeste l-lung [Partial order]) X . In the box to the left we find a series of codes that identify the patient and the clinic. The box in the mi d-dle lists prot o col attributes, of which only two  X  cycle and day number  X  have been fil led in. The box to the right, specifying a possible reduction of the dosage, remains empty in this case. B e-low we find further specifications. The yellow sticker at the bo t-tom has been taken from the bag in which the drug was delivered by the pharmacy. Thi s form not only represents a physician X  X  o r-der which is sent to the pharmacy; it embeds a clinical pr o tocol, and it is a record to be signed by intern and nurse when they a d-minister the chemotherapy.
 At ONC3 doctors enter their documentation directly in di gital form in the oncology system. When they look up the patient in the system, a list of  X  X isits X  a p pears. For each visit an entry to this list is produced, with the doctor entering the reason for the visit. S/he will look up the most r e cent blood results and call up  X  X rotocols X  and enter the name of a protocol, e.g.,  X  X  v e stin Irinotecan X , and a start date . The print -out of the chemotherapy order also contains the therapy plan. The doctor may then add supplementary ther a-pies, print out a prescription, ord er a blood test. Finally, s/he will settle the next a p pointment with the patient using a calendar and print out a new appointment sheet for the p a tient to take home. The doctor will finally, immediately after the p a tient has left, type a progress note in t he system. For this reason these notes are rel a-tively short. Progress notes are anyway mainly used to facilitate communication between doctors; however, if they are intended to be included in the discharge letter, doctors will use whole se n-tences and provi de more detailed background information. This document is also cum u lative, with different colors for past notes (dark yellow) and the current note (light yellow). The pr o gress notes are printed out and included in the patient folder, but they can also be v iewed individually or as a list on the screen. There are both striking commonalities and striking differences in the work pra c tices of the two settings, ONC1 and ONC3.
 Commonalities. First of all, the work itself is identical: patients are given the same repertoire of chemotherapies and suppleme n-tary infusions, and in preparation of the different kinds of trea t-ments, as well as for the purpose of monitoring the state of the p a-tients, various blood tests are ordered, prepared, a nd taken and the results are assessed. None of the settings offer other kinds of trea t-ment such as radiotherapy and surgery. In short, the essential work processes are identical in the two settings.
 Secondly, documentation work plays a particularly importa nt role in this clinical area, as aggressive chemicals are routinely admi n-i s tered for therapeutic pu r poses. In other words, the work of the clinics is safety -critical and accountability is of course a major concern. Hence the emphasis on documentation of a ll clin i cal measures. The magnitude of documentation work is exacerbated by the fact that oncology is a long -term and often inconclusive clinical process, with ther a pies organized in multiple cycles, and that patients may be coming for regular check -ups an d perhaps r e-peated treatment for years.
 And finally, ONC1 and ONC3 are both part of an association of municipal hospitals, and they thus operate under the same stat u-tory and economic fram e work. Furthermore, they both provide care to the same kind of client ele. These features of the work are identical in the two settings.
 Variations. On the other hand, however, in spite of these basic commonalities, the overall work organization as well as the coo r-dinative work practices differ quite strikingly. This has be en a m-ply demonstrated above. Why is that? There seem to be many re a-sons, from some obvious but rather mundane practical circu m-stances to some more elusive ones. A few examples will suffice. The physical structures in which the two settings are located of fer quite diffe r ent spatial constraints. In ONC1, the system of rooms and corridors is separated by a stairwell. By contrast, the space in which ONC3 is located is contiguous. The extent to which these trivial differences in physical setting account for di fferences in the work organization can of course only be determined if one was able to do a study of the history of the clinics, but it seems highly plausible that the physical constraints in which ONC1 finds itself has occasioned the outpatient clinic and the day clinic to be org a-nized as two separate entities, not only physically but also oper a-tionally, with separate reception counters. On the other hand, ONC3 has less storage space available in the basement and hence have resorted to transferring the con tent of patient folders co n-cerning patients who have not been at the clinic for a year to m i-crofiche. These constraints are trivial but can noneth e less have significant impact on actual work practices. The two settings also differ with respect to the comp uter -based information systems available. Both use the administrative info r-m a tion system that is a basic feature of the setup of the municipal hospital organization. In addition, ONC3 has an oncology info r-mation system that one does not find in the other c linics. The re a-sons for this are historical, in as much as the system was initially deve l oped more than a decade ago by one of the doctors at the clinic (in collaboration with an external partner). The same doctor is still at the clinic and engaged in mai n taining and making minor amendments to the system. This, as it were, accidental historical circumstance has provided ONC3 with the ability to use a computer -generated appointment sheet that serves such a ce n tral coordinative role in ONC3, as well as the l ist of the day X  X  appointments, on the basis of which the head doctor manually constructs the work plan for the teams of doctors and nurses in the outpatient clinic. At ONC1, all this i n-formation is distributed over several documents (patient diary, care sh eet, progress notes, etc.) that have to be aligned and viewed together. Having the specialized onco l ogy system also allows ONC3 to integrate information, such as an explicit the r apy plan, into one document, i.e., the order form for chemotherapy, thereby pr ovi d ing an overview where and when it may be of use.
 Although accidental in a sense, these variations are as many r e-sults of the d e voted experimentation of competent staff. They will, for example, identify gaps in the doc u mentation system and design new do cuments to fill those gaps, such as, e.g., the care sheet and the therapy sheet, which both have been intr o duced by the head nurse in ONC1 in order to improve nurses X  overview and su p port the workflow.
 So a third source of variation is, not at all surprisi ngly, that pract i-tioners from time to time engage in experimenting with other ways of doing what they do and adopt amended pra c tices that are perceived to be more efficient, reliable, robust, etc.
 Dampers on variability . Variability of work practices is ch ecked and co n strained, however, for many reasons. Two will suffice here. First, of course, there is an obvious if not known cost to changing work practices. To the  X  X atural attitude X  of the practiti o-ner, things are presumed to be and stay as they normally are, u n-less of course he or she has reasons to think otherwise [20]. Se c-ond, permutations of work practices are not random occurrences. In ONC1, for instance, patients are not required to have appoin t-ments to visit the outpatient clinic. This arrangement, which was adopted years ago, is, at least partly, mot i vated by an assessment that having patients arrive at pre -arranged times might be ineff i-cient for patients and clinicians alike. As a result of this arrang e-ment, ho w ever, the reception counters need to be staffed by nurses, since the task of admitting patients then often involves clinical asses s ments. This, in turn, then prompted the nurses to devise and adopt the care sheet so as to be able to handle the workflow. The same systemic quality is found in the multitude of specialized clinical and coordinative artifacts we find in the two clinics, which collectively form what Fitzpatrick has termed  X  X he working record X :  X  X  set of complexly interrelated clinician -centred doc u-ments that are locally evolved, ma intained and used to support d e-livery of care X  [11], and which we call  X  X rdering systems X  [19]. The different types of documents are compleme n tary in the sense that they have to be aligned and read together, on the one hand, to give a full picture of a pat ient X  X  tr a jectory and, on the other hand, to support the  X  X mooth flow of work X . What unifies this multitude is some very simple elements that serve as  X  X lue X , most impo r-tantly the patient ID -labels, which, although composed in slightly different ways at th e two clinics, apply similar coding pri n ciples. That is, work organizations and coordinative practices are, if not tightly coupled sy s tems, then most certainly package deals.
 Second -order commonalities . At another level of abstraction, however, we observe some deep commonalities in the coordin a-tive practices of the clinics. We will here mention only a few of the most sal i ent. (1) The patient folders are containers in which artifacts are r e-tained and acc u mulated for later use. Individual artifacts, such as t he do c tor X  X  progress notes, likewise accumulate data to be read by others at future patient visits, to be i n cluded in the discharge letter, and so forth. As expressed by Berg in his study of patient records, such artifacts both  X  accumulate inscriptions and coord i-nate activ i ties of other entities in the work practice, and in that way afford the handling of more complex wor k tasks X  [3]. (2) Documents originally devised for one particular purpose are endlessly used for other, perhaps even unrelated, purposes. P a tient folders, for example, are used at both clinics for not only contai n-ing clinical documents, but also as coordinative artifacts, as not i-fications that patients have arrived and, when stacked, to indicate the order in which patients are to be seen [cf. 11]. On the other hand, documents devised for coordinative pu r poses are used for clinical purposes. The appointment sheet (ONC3), for exa m ple, informs all actors, including the p a tient and the family doctor, about the diagnosis as well as past and current inte r ventions. The list of appointments in ONC3 is not only used for planning inte r-ventions and alloca t ing resources for the next day. It is also used by the nurse  X  who will make annotations to the list (providing additional information or highligh t ing a problem)  X  so as to communicate with the doctor.
 In some cases, this  X  X ual use X  or even  X  X ulti -functionality X  is r e-flected in the material design of the artifact. Thus, to serve pu r-poses of accountability, each of the documents has been designed to provid e space for (multiple) sign a tures. And, to take one final example, the chemotherapy order forms make explicit references to the relevant clinical prot o col. (3) At yet another level of abstraction, what is perhaps most r e-markable with these artifacts is the endless variation, combination, and recombination of a limited repertoire of formats and not a-tions. Accordingly, the artifacts are easily re c ognizable (also to colleagues from another clinic, for i n stance) and can be easily adapted and appropr i ated.
 A maj or feature of the standard format of ordering is the use of spatial a r rangements of elements (such as text organized as lists, tables, and charts) for purposes of communication and coordin a-tion. The specific spatial arrangement of information on the surfa ce of each of these artifacts (their spatial concatenation, their proxi m ity or distance across the surface on which they are inscribed) has a specific significance. The care sheet and the therapy sheet (ONC1), for example, are both organized in the form of simple m a trices. Information on activities at a particular point in time is arranged horizo n tally. Read vertically, we see a trajectory in time, visit after visit, entry after entry. Tabular order allows for daily entries and, when read in a sequence, vis ualizes a trajectory. The spatial organization also loosely reflects a certain order of exam i-nations to be carried out.
 The spatial arrangement is not restricted to the organization of the surfaces of artifacts (paper or screen) but applies to the way in w hich artifacts and collections of artifacts are ordered in the se t-ting. The patient folder, for example, is a co m plex assembly of spatially formatted artifacts that, itself, is organized spatially, as a stack, with a cover with various inscriptions. The pa tient folder at ONC3 has the most recent lab result on top and in the patient folder at ONC1 the most recent progress note appears as the first page. And again, the patient folders are (recursively) ordered sp a-tially into multiple stacks so as to represent the alloc a tion of work as well as the temporal order in which it is to be carried out. These spatial ordering techniques are of the same kind, because, as a r-gued by Roy Harris,  X  X he underlying formal substratum of writing is [... ] sp a tial X  [13, p. 45]. Tha t is, in spite of the striking variation of coordinative practices at the two clinics, we find that these practices exhibit some r e-markable  X  X igher -order X  commonalities. Coordinative action by means of spatial arrangements of items, on surfaces or in real space, is prevalent. In itself, this is not really surprising, of course, since the practiti o ners belong to a literate culture in which these kinds of notations are ubiquitous. The questions that do arise, however, are: What are the coordinative protocols that are e x-pressed in these notations and what is the grammar of their co m-position? That is, what do the specific spatial concatenations of the different items in different circumstances denote and by means of which recurrent elements and rules of composit ion are they constructed? It is obvious that some arrang e ments (the ordering of patient folders in stacks, the ordering of patients appointments in lists, etc.) express a temporal order ( X  X lock time X , projected s e-quence ). In other instances such arrangemen ts express prio r ity . Anyway, a list or a stack is composed and read as a way of e x-pressing certain types of relationships, namely, timing, s e quence, and priority. Now, these are only a couple of the most obvious e x-amples. Other types of relationships can a lso be d e tected and have been noted in passing above: authorization or attestation (by proximate initials), relevance (also by proximity), allocation (by location), identification and validation (conspicuous position on cover of patient folder). And so on.
 In addition, we have of course noted a host of other recurring c o-ordinative protocol elements, or  X  X uilding blocks X , such as the id -codes that serve as  X  X lue X , the classification schemes (of diagn o-ses, clinical protocols, patient folders) that help worke rs to ma n-age the vast  X  X roblem space X  of onco l ogy work. The next step (a big step) would then be to consider how such a grammar of coordinative protocols might be supported by comp u-tational tec h niques. However, although such an analysis might have  X  X mplic ations for design X  of some significance, and we b e-lieve that it would, this would take us far beyond the purpose and scope of this article. We have here simply indicated such potential implic a tions because such a prospect has a bearing on the overall theme of this article, the issue of how ethnography can contribute to design in view of the variability of c o operative practices. The question as to whether, and how, ethnographic studies of work practices may help us in the design of computer -based sy s-tems for work settings is the topic of extensive and mostly fruitful invest i gations and discussions in CSCW. We have no intention, or indeed ambition, of covering the essentials of this marvelous line of work here (see instead [16; 17]). Instead we want to address a sub -theme of this work, namely, the question of how, given the variability of work practices , ethnography can contribute to sy s-tems design. This is an old question.
 The problem was hinted at by Bannon a nd Schmidt in 1989 when they posited that  X  X esigning computer -based systems for cooper a-tive work settings is like writing in water. By careful anal y sis and design, the information system may be designed to match the cu r-rent social stru c ture of the labor pr ocesses. But this change of technology, in turn, induces a change of the social structure of the labor processes X  [2, p. 368]. That is, it was suggested, although only implicitly, that design d e cisions grounded in studies of actual practices might become o bliterated by the changes in work pra c-tices somehow induced or inspired by the eventual appropriation of the technical innovations thus informed.
 This implication was made quite explicit some years later by Grudin and Grinter [12] who appropriately dubbed it  X  X he ethno g-r a phers X  dilemma X :  X  X he better [the ethnographers] do their job, the more fine -grained in detail their understanding of the nature of the work as it is cu r rently organized, the more likely they are to see how di s ruptive a new technology will be. A distant designer may see the workgroup on one peak and dimly through the haze see a higher peak nearby, and imagine a straight path from the one up to the other, but an ethnographer sees the valleys in between, the diff i culties in making the trip, th e uncertainty of success, the possibi l ity that the higher peak will not be as comfortable a place to work after all (or was an illusion) X  [12]. While the  X  X ilemma X  here is framed as a problem of the  X  X evo lutionary X  disruption r e-quired to reach a  X  X igher p eak X  (according to some criteria), the underlying issue is the same: the problematic nature of a design endeavor grounded in work practices that may not be all that solid and may even be merely transitory.
 Unsurprisingly, the  X  X thnographers X  dilemma X  has b een a constant theme in CSCW since then [e.g., 1; 7; 15]. Bob Anderson, for e x-ample, addressed the problem in a lengthy survey article on et h-nography and system design [1]. Citing Grudin and Grinter, A n-derson suggested that the dilemma was a matter of atti tude. Int i-mating that many ethnographers shrink from engaging in  X  X xpli c-itly engineered change X  for political and similar reasons, he stated that  X  X thno g raphy itself X  does not necessarily do so:  X  X f we set the context for the ethnography at the level at wh ich many ethnogr a-phers feel most comfortable, we will find they are almost o b-sessed with change of one sort or another. In pic k ing their way through the minutiae of routine action, prominence is (endlessly) given to the innovative, the ad hoc , and the unpr edic t able rife in the workplace and elsewhere. Change, here, is the very stuff of ethnography. [...] Ethnographies, then, are representations of changes brought about by the interaction of different force fields operating at different levels and the myriad u nintended and unn o-ticed ways in which the consequences and functions of such changes play through. X  [1] We believe we can recognize the tendency Anderson is referring to, namely, that  X  X rominence is (endlessly) given to the innov a-characterization of ethnography in CSCW. Anyway, this issue is again beyond the scope of the paper. The reason we quote Ande r-son here is that his argument misses the issue it purports to a d-dress and does so in in teresting ways. First of all, to the extent that ethnographers are  X  X lmost obsessed with change X  and monotonously give prominence to  X  X he innov a-tive, the ad hoc , and the unpredic t able rife in the workplace X , they are distorting their ethn ographies,  X  a mos t serious misunderstan d-ing X  against which we were warned already in 1973 by Egon Bittner, one of the founders of ethnomethodo l ogy, in his strong call for  X  realism in field work X  [6].
 Bittner X  X  argument is rooted in phenomenological soc i ology. As ethnograph ers, he posits, we are interested in  X  X hat outlook which takes over when som e thing must be done, for example, when someone must do what needs doing to successfully take a plane across the country X . Accordingly, we have to recognize and take very seriously that the practitioner  X  X ust be prepared to deal on the world X  X  terms X . That is, for the practitioner in his or her  X  X at u-ral attitude X ,  X  X ometimes some things have to be done, and som e-times there is no getting around certain things, no matter what, in spite of all rational co n siderations. X  Now,  X  into this setting moves the field worker, a visitor whose main interest in things is to see them, and to whom, accordingly, all things are primarily exhibits . X  The implication of this  X  that the setting  X  X s not the field worker's own, actual life situation X   X  Bittner then goes to argue , is that for the field worker  X  X hings are never naturally themselves but only specimens of the m selves X . These are unavoidable conditions for any ethnography. However, as a result, a ce rtain intellectua l ism may distort the ethnography:  X  X ince the field worker [...] always sees things from a freely ch o-sen vantage point  X  chosen, to be sure, from among actually taken vantage points  X  he tends to experience reality as being of subjective orig in to a far greater extent than is typical in the nat u-ral attitude. Slipping in and out of points of view, he cannot avoid appreciating meanings of objects as more or less freely conjured. X  Consequently, the setting is rendered  X  X n ways that far from b e ing realistic are actually heavily inte l lectualized constructions that partake more of the character of theoretical formulation than of realistic description. X  Alternatively to this  X  X erious misunderstanding X , Bittner calls for  X  X he retention of an unbiased i nterest in things as they actually present themselves to the perceiving su b ject X   X   X  X he foundation of realism in field work . X  But to achieve this,  X  X he field worker needs not only a good grasp of the perspe c tives of those he studies but also a good underst anding of the di s tortive tendencies his own special perspective tends to introduce. X  Now, if we in our analyses of work practices give prominence to  X  X he innovative, the ad hoc , X  etc. we will be rendering practices in ways that are  X  X eavily intellectualize d co n structions. X  That is, if we heed Bittner X  X  warning, we cannot take Anderson X  X  rather a g-nostic position and accept the reputed  X  X bse s sion with change X  simply as an attitude some may wish to adopt and others not. An ethnography characterized by an  X  X bse ssion with change X  is a  X  X eavily intellectualized construction X  just as much as one o b-sessed with regula r ity.
 What all this amounts to is that Anderson X  X  attempt to deal with  X  X he ethnographers X  dilemma X  constitutes an (eloquent) evasion of the issue and t hat it has itself contributed to the  X  X uddle X  it set out to dissolve. If ethnographies are indeed 'representations of changes', then there is of course no ethnographers X  dilemma, but then it would also be rather difficult for ethn o graphic studies to 'infor m' design in any meaningful way. 1 The question remains 1 It may be t his realization which makes Dourish see m ingly abandon the whole idea of  X  X mplications for design X  [8]:  X  X eeking to close the gap [between social requirements and technical feas i-bility] through the application of ethnographic methods is a co n-tradiction in t erms [The] domain of technology and the domain of everyday experience cannot be separated from each other; they are mutually constitutive. The role of ethnography, then, cannot be to mediate between these two domains, because ethnography does not accept th eir co n ceptual separation in the first place. X  There is certainly a sense in which this proposition  X  that tec h-nology and work practice are mutually constitutive  X  is true. It X  X  a logico -grammatical proposition on par with saying that a bat h-tub is only a b athtub to a life form that takes baths! But does it thus as before, how can we conduct ethnographies and derive d e-sign lessons from our findings if work practices turn out to be deeply unstable? We are bound to remain forever in this spot, if the co n ce pt of work practice remains mixed up with notions of the essentially contingent or ad hoc . That is, to move out of this impasse we first have to look at the concept of practice and then discuss what it means to investigate a work pra c tice. The concept of practice is used as a way of referring to what is actually done as opposed to what nominally should be done (as in the phrase,  X  X t may work in theory but not in practice X ); it is, in this sense, very much a residual category of epistemological status, deno ting the ine x haustible universe of actual occurrences that any given  X  X heory X ,  X  X ule X , or  X  X lan X  presumes but does not and cannot express, since it, as a  X  X inguistic con struct X , is  X  X nde r-specified X , as Suchman put it [21]. But the concept of  X  X rac tice X  a lso, at the very same time, denotes what is routinely done, as o p-posed to  X  X he innovative, the ad hoc , and the unpredic t able rife in the workplace X .  X  X o practice X  som e thing is just that: to turn what has been taught into a routine. That is, ethnographies o bsessed with change will tend to lose sight of the phenomenon they were supposed to report on: work pra c tices.
 There is nothing mysterious or elusive about work practices. We can recognize specific practices and can delimit and di s tinguish one from another , by the  X  X ules X  that define them. We can describe them at any level of detail, as we may wish, we can even do so exhaustively for any practical purpose (but not for all pu r poses). We can identify variations in those practices as well as deviations from th em. We can observe how specific practices and their co n-stitutive rules are questioned, evaluated, debated, unde r mined, and challenged, but also how they are defended, promoted, adopted, applied, enforced, and upheld by instruction, training, and san c-tion. We do so routinely, accountably, and un problemati cally, without imputing preconceived constructions, and we do so both as pract i tioners and as observers.
 Where a field worker may lose his or her way in this, however, is in the criteria for determining wh ether a particular line of action is in accord with the  X  X he way things are to be done X , the practice, or if it X  X  a deviation of some sorts. Sociologists have, as far back as anybody can recall, been apt to grant themselves privileged status with respect t o interpreting the plans, rules, procedures, and fo r-mal schemas they find. As demonstrated by Bittner, in another ( e-qually classic) paper, this  X  X s not only inappropriate but strictly speaking impossible X  [5]. If an action to an observer looks like a devia tion from a rule but is not somehow rectified by practiti o ners in the se t ting ( X  X ops, sorry! X ), then the observer has no grounds for considering it an aberration.
 The concept of practice should not be confounded with ad hoc a c-tion . A practice is normativel y regular action,  X  X ot something that happens once X  [22]. In the oncology clinics, work is massively conti n gent, lines of action vary not only from one patient to the next one who typically will have a diffe r ent diagnosis, age, sex, general health, etc., b ut for each patient from one visit to the next, as treatment progresses and the p a tient X  X  condition changes this or that way. These are mu n dane variations, and there is nothing ad preclude that a specific artifact or tec h nical system could be clumsy, unwieldy, unsafe, inadequate, or utterly useless to a sp e-cific practice? hoc in the way they are handled; they are dealt with routinely, a c-cording to the procedures of the clinic, its workflow prescriptions and its coordinative prot o cols as represented by the collection of coordinative artifacts. There are, of course, also what might be dubbed low -frequency variations. Sometimes practitioners will exp erience that certain ways of doing things will have unwanted effects in certain situ a-tions; it may be that in such instances coordination measures are seen as cumbersome, or it may be that they have experienced breakdowns in coordination and have been forc ed to revert to ad hoc measures. Or they may have received a new tool or a new version of application software, which turns out to make some tasks easier and some tasks more difficult. Whatever brings it about, they will occasionally reconsider their worki ng practice and will now and then revise the  X  X ule book X . The coordinative practices we have observed in the clinics have evolved this way. As the next step forward, out of the impasse, we propose to di s-tinguish (at least) two categorically different rela tionships b e-tween workplace study and systems design: (1) workplace studies of specific settings for the purpose of  X  X eveloping X  specific sy s-tems for the setting in que s tion, and (2) workplace studies for the purpose of developing more or less generic or s tandardized tec h-nical building blocks that can be combined and recombined en d-lessly and that may thus enable practitioners, however const i tuted organizatio n ally, to experiment with, adapt, and over time further develop their practices, without or with only minimal technical assistance and thus also without assistance of mediating wor k-place stu d ies [cf., 18].
 Ad 1 : In the development of specific systems for specific settings, for which in -depth workplace studies are required, the ethnogr a-pher X  X  dilemma is a real one. The solution to it is not conceptual but immensely practical. For a workplace study of a specific pra c-tice to contribute to design for that practice, it is critically impo r-tant to analyze the rationale of the observed practice: Why do they do thi ngs the way they do, why this way and not that ? Why this specific allocation of tasks? Why this particular configuration and flow of coordinative artifacts? And so on. In our cases, what are the  X  X osts and benefits X  of the different work organizations we c an observe, to patients, to the different categories of clinical staff, to the budget, etc.? What would be the  X  X osts and benefits X  to practitioners of an altern a tive workflow, a different division of labor, etc.? For workplace studies to lift this task, w e need to d e-velop our analytical i n struments to include ultra -practical issues such as advantages and disadvantages of different ways of doing what is to be done in terms of safety, security, productivity, tim e-liness, reliability, accountability, flexibili ty, dignity, etc. These aims and criteria are of course contradictory, and moreover, di f-ferent stakeholders may have different ratio n ales. This means that field workers getting involved in design need to be able to engage with practitioners and other stake holders in this kind of (partly co n flictual) reasoning. Ad 2 : The role of workplace studies in the development of novel technologies in the form of generic or standardized  X  X uilding blocks X  that can be combined and recombined endlessly is an e n-tirely diff erent one. Here the focus is not on the rationale of sp e-cific practices in order to determine what is  X  X ssential X  and what is  X  X ccidental X , but to identify, if possible, the elements and rules of combination out of which coordinative artifacts and protocol s are or could be combined and recombined. What are the logics of c o-ordinative pra c tices? For example, what is the  X  X rammar X  of the spatial organization of patient records in stacks, or the spatial o r-ganization of temp o rally separate events (visit to clini cs, tests) in care sheets, or the spatial concatenation of multiple discrete art i-facts? While these two categories of workplace studies are radically di f-ferent in their orientation and scope, they may of course hugely benefit from each other. One the one h and, the CSCW research efforts that aim at understanding and articulating  X  X igher -order X  c o ordinative practices depend critically on a corpus of in -depth studies of actual practices in different domains. While there is evidently a need for focused studies of the  X  X rammars X  of coord i-native practices, the highly localized workplace studies that are being undertaken play an important role in so far as they contri b-ute to this corpus. On the other hand, the recurrent features of c o-ordinative practices ident i fied and categorized by investigations of  X  X igher -order X  practices may offer useful analytical categories for localized stu d ies. The research reported in this paper is carried out as part of the Canadian Action for Health project financed by th e SSHRC (S o-cial Sciences and Humanities Research Council).
