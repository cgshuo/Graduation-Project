 Transformations in collaborative work due to the introduction of new technology are inevitable, but are often difficult to study. In this paper, we consider the patterns of transformation that are seen in a patient-physician relationship based on the introduction of home-care monitoring equipment. We report findings from interviews and fieldwork with patients and physicians participating in a clinical experiment of homecare monitoring. By studying both the group of patients who receive homecare-based treatment and the control group we were able to identify transformations in the collaborative activity as caused by the homecare monitoring technology. We ap-ply activity theory as a theoretical basis for this analysis. We con-sider the implications of these findings for the design of pervasive health monitoring technologies.

With the facing healthcare challenges of the Western world, pa-tient self-monitoring based on wireless home-based monitoring tech-nology is achieving an increasing focus these years. However, from a medical point of view, monitoring is merely the basis for home-based treatment of the patient. In order for the data-flow from the patient to the physician to make sense, there is a need for informa-tion to flow from the physician back to the patient, helping him or Copyright 2005 ACM 1-59593-223-2/05/0011 ... $ 5.00. her proceed in medical treatment. Seen from a CSCW perspective, we are facing a genuine collaborative effort mediated by new kinds of computing technology and these types of technologies are go-ing to fundamentally change the cooperation between the patient and his or her physician. Little research into computer-mediated collaboration between the physician and the patient from a CSCW perspective has, however, been done so far.

In this study we want to put special focus on the relationship be-tween the patient and his physician as mediated by pervasive mon-itoring technology and how this technology may be designed to fa-cilitate appropriate cooperation in home-based treatment based on monitoring. In particular, we examine how the patient-physician relationship is transformed when introducing new homecare mon-itoring and communication technology. Transformations in coop-erative work caused by the introduction of new technology are in-evitable. But due to the inherent longitudinal character of this trans-formation, it is difficult to study. In this study we were able to follow a clinical trial which had both a group of patients receiv-ing home-based treatment based on self-monitoring and a control group. By studying the transformations, we can draw conclusions about how homecare monitoring and treatment technologies can be designed to incorporate the lessons from CSCW on supporting re-mote computer-mediated collaboration and communication.
Our study examines home-based treatment of hypertension in a large health district in Denmark. Hypertension is one of the large  X  X illers X  in Western societies and early detection and treatment may lead to increase life length and quality. In this project  X  unlike many other monitoring projects  X  focus was extended beyond mere mon-itoring to include computer support for patient-physician commu-nication and for relating the monitoring data with the medical treat-ment. From a medical point of view, this was unique to this project. From a computer science perspective this moved the project from a simple data-transfer and monitoring setup to computer support for shared care and treatment based on monitoring data.

We carried out a series of interviews and field studies of home-based monitoring and treatment of hypertension and considered is-sues of medical treatment, division of work, communication, pa-tient self-understanding, and technology in our analysis. Most med-ical studies of home-based monitoring of hypertension provide ev-idence that this kind of monitoring provides more accurate mea-surements. Our findings emphasize, however, how the relationship between the physician and the patient is changed when introducing a new computer-mediated home-based treatment for hypertension. More specifically, we report on four specific aspects of this trans-formation caused by pervasive monitoring and treatment technol-ogy:
In the following section we review the background for embark-ing upon pervasive technologies for medical monitoring and treat-ment, and discuss related work. We then describe the setting in which we carried out our observations and report on our major find-ings. Finally, we discuss the implications for the design of perva-sive monitoring and treatment technologies before concluding the paper.
Remote medical treatment is nothing new. Telemedicine has been employed for more than a hundred years, ever since the tele-phone appeared [18] to enable cooperation between clinicians over long-distances or difficult terrains. Lately, telemedicine has moved to the Internet and augmented by technological advances like video conferences [1], voice recognition, databases and artificial intelli-gence [30, 3, 16].

Telemedicine is hence computer-supported cooperative work par excellence, using computers to enable clinicians to work together over distance or provide care for patients at home. However, to our knowledge, the only study of telemedicine reported in the CSCW literature is the work done by Kaplan and Fritzpatrick [22] who discuss the use of the Locales framework in the design of a tele-medicine application for cooperation between distributed hospital intensive care units in Australia. Conventional homecare with a nurse visiting people at home have been studied by Pinelle and Gutwin [31] who emphasize how homecare nurses have different methods for managing cooperation across loosely coupled and mo-bile groups. Especially, providing access to shared knowledge and ways of leaving  X  X races X  for each other seems to facilitate coordina-tion in such mobile settings. A similar point is made by Kindberg et al. [23] who describe how loosely coupled clinicians in charge of treating diabetic patients help coordinate their work through knowl-edge sharing. The focus of this paper is not, however, cooperation between clinicians, but the cooperation between clinicians and pa-tients.

Because most western countries are facing a demographic shift and an increase in lifespan, a larger percentage of adults will re-quire medical care. The rising cost of medical procedures in com-bination with the greater numbers of people needing assistance will place an enormous strain on healthcare providers. Many diseases that severely limit quality of life are difficult to manage in their late stages, but can be treated more effectively and less expensively if caught early. Early detection, monitoring, and treatment is, there-fore, increasingly of interest to all parties in the medical system [20, 27]. This preventive effort and early detection cannot, however, be done by the family doctor or by a nurse visiting the homes of the patients, which is the prevalent model today. The cost would be extensive and it would simply not scale. For this reason, home-based self-monitoring of patients is receiving an increasing interest and a substantial amount of research into home-based monitoring is taking place both within medical science [35, 34], in Ubiquitous Computing research [39, 43], as well as in biomedical engineer-ing [24, 21, 2]. But monitoring is only  X  X ne way X . To make home-based medical care and treatment successful, there is a need for clinicians to  X  X each out X  to the homes of the patients and to engage in tele-treatment when needed. The aim is to enable remote cooper-ation and relationship between a health care professional (typically a physician or a GP) and a patient, mediated by the use of computer technology (see e.g. [10]).

For such technologies to become successful, we need to take into consideration how they transform the physician-patient relationship and how they scale. The whole rationale behind this is exactly that the same clinical personnel can manage an increasing amount of more ill patients. Studies of transformation in cooperative work caused by the introduction on new technology are hard and few studies in CSCW have done this. However, when done these stud-ies are particular interesting because they often reveal how systems intentionally designed in one way, later are adapted to the work setting and used differently. For example, by studying the use of paper-based medical records and comparing this to the adoption (and adaptation) of a computer-based medical record, Heath and Luff [19] were able to detail how simple things in the design of the system has some radical effects in its use, including how clinicians maintain their paper-based record as a supplement to the computer-based one. By studying the work at a printshop floor before and after the introduction of a workflow system, Bowers et al. [8] were able to reveal how the workings of certain aspects of the system can have some fundamental implication for the users ability to maintain flexibility in the flow of work. Both of these studies, however, focus on how new technologies do not fit into the delicate details of coop-erative work in a work setting and do not discuss how technology transforms the work. Moreover, they do not provide a conceptual understanding of the underlying aspects of transformation in work as caused by new technology. This is the conceptual focus of this paper.
The goal of the  X  X eleMedical Blood Pressure X  (TMBP) project was to investigate the design of homecare technology for telemedi-cal treatment of hypertension of patients at home. This overall goal was subdivided into two sub-goals. The clinical goal of the project was to establish whether home-based treatment of hypertension would improve the treatment and life quality of patients. The tech-nological goal was to design, deploy, and evaluate the use of stan-dard, commonly available monitoring and communication technol-ogy to learn how such technologies could be improved based on new ubiquitous computing technology. The following subsection will shortly described the clinical goal in some details but the rest of this paper will focus on the technological goal of the project.
The possibility of getting more frequent and accurate data, per-form diagnosis and treatment of hypertension on the basis of re-mote monitoring has lead to a number of studies and suggestions for different systems. Among the systems that have been subjected to randomized trials, Rogers et al. used automatic 24-hour mea-suring of blood pressure measuring with data transmitted via tele-phone in the treatment of high blood pressure [35] and in the di-agnosis of essential hypertension [34]. They conclude that moni-toring improves diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Abodh et al. [1] conducted a study to assess the accuracy of telemedicine treatment of hypertension based on patients X  self-monitoring and subsequent video-conference with a health care provider, as com-pared to treatment in-person at a hypertension clinic. They con-clude that telemedicine proved to be a valid means for detecting uncontrolled blood pressure among hypertensive patients.
Friedman et al. [16] argue that Telephone-Linked Care (TLC) provides a means to achieve  X  X irtual visits X  that allow more patients to be seen within the course of a day and hence drive down costs, while at the same time allowing for high quality. Their TLC-system combines telephone, which they argued (in 1997) was preferable to the internet that was less accessible to the general population, with key-pad interaction and an automated health care response system. A randomized trial has been conducted for the TLC ap-plication for hypertension with a positive result. As compared to non-TLC users, the system lead to increased medication adherence, decreased blood pressure, and reduction of stroke risk. Patients were satisfied with the application, which patients found easy to use, made them more aware of their hypertension, and relieved their worries about their disease [15]. In general, based on two random-ized trials, Friedman et al. conclude that  X ...TLC use, thus far, is associated with positive changes in targeted health behaviors and improvement in disease control. Patients have been satisfied with their use of the system, and physicians integrate TLC reports into their medical practice. X  [16, p. 424]. These positive experiences are supported by the 2004 symposium Telemedicine in Hypertension where a number of other randomized trials have been conducted and which lead to the conclusion that  X  X elemedicine BP monitoring systems are efficient in improving hypertension controls, and also better drug utilization and less frequent office visits can be expected as a result X  [14].

Characteristically however, these clinically oriented analyses do not put the relationship between patient and physician under scrutiny, nor do they consider the implications of the particular designs of the telemedicine blood monitoring technology in details. As we will argue below, the system of relationships between patient and GP is transformed by the introduction of new technology. While our case supports the general assessment of patient satisfaction with telemedicine blood pressure monitoring, it also shows that telemedicine has implications that go beyond achieving more ac-curate clinical data for better diagnosis and treatment.
Figure 1 illustrates the technical setup for hypertension monitor-ing in the TMBP project. An off-the-shelf blood pressure monitor (Omron 705IT) is attached to a PDA (HP iPAQ) using an USB ca-ble. The PDA has a GSM modem embedded, which is used for establishing a HTTP over GPRS link to the server. The blood pres-sure monitor and the PDA are mounted in a briefcase, as can been seen in figure 5. The server is a standard web server running a suite of programs for receiving, storing and showing data for patients, GPs, and the medical staff at the hospital.

Basically, the software on the PDA supports the two main aspects of the home-care concept: The main functionality of the server software is to: Figure 1: The technical TMBP platform including a self-inflatable blood pressure monitor, a PDA, and a data and web server.
The most important data is the chart shown in figure 2, which shows the patient X  X  blood pressure over time related to the amount and type of medicine prescribed. This chart was essential to moni-tor the development in blood pressure and regulate prescribed med-ical treatment.
 Figure 2: Graph showing measurements and medication over time.
In accordance with the two sub-goals of the project (c.f. sec-tion 3), the TMBP project applied two different types of research methods, namely a clinical trial and a field study of the use of homecare technology in the treatment of hypertension.
Initially the clinical trial included two GPs and a number of their patients eligible for hypertension treatment. Now the project in-cludes 125 patients and 10 GPs. The patients are randomly divided into two groups: A telemedicine group and a conventional group providing data for comparison between the two approaches. The TMBP briefcase is handed out and demonstrated to the patient at the GP X  X  office.

The clinical protocol for a patient doing telemedicine blood pres-sure measurements is as follows: Each patient conducts a blood pressure measurement three times weakly, each measurement con-sisting of three consecutive measurements with a one minute inter-val. Furthermore, during the clinical trial the patients can have no blood pressure related communication with the GP except through the communicational functionality of the telemedicine artifact. This is a scientific procedure in order to be able to research the results of this type of communication. Whenever a measurement is com-pleted, the result is shown on the screen of the PDA. After every third measurement, the results are sent to the server from which they can be viewed by the GP.

At the time of writing, the clinical trial is still on-going and we hence do not know the results from this clinical part of the project.
During the first months of the clinical trial, the last author con-ducted an empirical field study in the homes of the users. He visited five patients and their GP. Each visit lasted between an hour and an hour and a half. The visits began with the patient conducting a mea-surement (as described above) which was captured by digital pho-tos. This was followed by an informal interview based on an open interview guide. The interview covered aspects such as usability, patient-GP relationships, communication and the personal conse-quences of the use of the technology, e.g. the patient X  X  enhanced insight into her own level of hypertension, effects on the patient X  X  daily routine, etc. The visit to the GP consisted of an informal in-terview and a demonstration of the GP X  X  use of the system. The interview covered aspects such as communication, patient-GP rela-tionship, data available for treatment through the new system, and how the treatment was done in the control group. It is the findings from this fieldwork that will be presented, analyzed and discussed in this article.
Activity theory is a social psychological theory focusing on the developmental transformations and dynamics in collective human work activity as mediated by technological artifacts. In this sense, activity theory provides appropriate conceptualizations, suited for analyzing cooperative work, its dynamic transformation, and the importance of cooperative breakdowns. Activity theory was initially formulated by Vygotsky [41] and Leontyev [26, 25], and further elaborated by e.g. Engestr  X  om [12]. Activity theory has been widely applied within the HCI and CSCW fields (e.g. [9, 5, 28]).

Activity theory posits that human consciousness and understand-ing of the world is an outcome of human activity, e.g. human in-teraction with other humans and the world. Activity has four ba-sic characteristics: firstly, it is has a motive of satisfying a need and hence directed towards an object that can be either material or ideal. Secondly, activities are always mediated by artifacts that can be material (tools) or immaterial (signs and language), and thirdly, almost always part of collective activities that entail rules, norms and a division of labor. Finally, activities can be subdivided into three levels: activity, action and operation. Activities are the con-scious realization of objects through chains of actions and explain why an activity happens. Actions strive towards conscious goals and explain what actors do to achieve the object of the activity. Op-erations are the unconscious movements and cognitive processes needed in actions and activities. Actions can be internalized to the extent that they can be performed unconsciously and hence become operations, just as operations can become actions whenever the in-ternalized procedure breaks down. Processes of internalization, i.e. a process in which practical activities become mental processes, and processes of externalization, i.e. the manifestation of mental processes in practical activities, can occur on all three levels of ac-tivity. Human activity is thus a constant process of internalizations and externalizations mediated by social, external activity, artifacts, signs and language. Whereas Vygotsky and Leontyev tend to focus on individuals, Engestr  X  om [12, 13] has extended the subject-artifact-object model to incorporate the social and collective aspects of activities. His so-cial activity system can be represented as in figure 3. The top trian-gle depicts the subject-artifact-object relationship described above. This single-person triangle has been supplemented with three other aspects: Rules regulate the actors X  activities by for example regula-tions, law, conventions or collective traditions; community concerns the group of actors that share the object in question and can be seen as the social frame of people within which activities take place; and division of labor concerns the subdivision of the activities into sub-tasks. The system should be seen as a whole in which changes in one relationship may change the overall system as such.
Activity theory thus provides an analytical framework for under-standing and analyzing the mediation of human activity by artifacts and how this may lead to overall changes in human practice. Fur-thermore, the model helps us analyze transformation in social activ-ity by pointing to the core mediating aspects of this activity. If one mediator  X  e.g. the  X  X rtifact X   X  is changed we may expect changes in the structure of the entire activity system. We will apply this in our analysis of transformations in the relationship between the GP and the patient in the TMBP project next. In this and the next section we will apply activity theory to the TMBP project and analyze the transformations taking place in the collaborative work between the patient and the GP as a result of the introduction of the home-based self-monitoring equipment. Due to the analysis of both the group of patients receiving telemedical treatment and the control group, we are able to study the difference and hence the transformation as caused by the introduction of new technology.
Conventional measurements take place in the GP X  X  clinic. The activity begins with the patient making a call to the clinic to set up an appointment with the secretary. As none of the patients were un-dergoing treatment for hypertension before the project they would only have their blood pressure measured 2-3 times yearly, since they were conducted during consultations regarding other medical issues. On the day of the consultation the patient makes her way to the clinic. Due to the standard opening hours of clinics such visits normally take place during work hours, which means the patient has to take time off from work. After arriving at the clinic the pa-tient waits in the waiting room for her turn. According to several of the patients this waiting time can be quite frustrating. Once the consultation has begun the measurement activity can commence. The patient sits near the GP X  X  table with her right arm on the table. On the patient X  X  arm, the GP mounts an inflatable cuff connected to a rubber bulb (for inflating the cuff) and the sphygmomanometer. The GP then starts to pump the rubber bulb to fill the cuff while listening to the pulse with a stethoscope. When the cuff is pumped to the tightest level, no pulse is audible. The GP then proceeds to let air out of the cuff and the pulse becomes audible again. When the first pulse becomes audible the GP reads the number indicated on the sphygmomanometer  X  this number equals the systolic pres-sure. As the air is let out of the cuff the pulse becomes weaker, and the number on the sphygmomanometer at the last pulse au-dible is the diastolic pressure. Together the diastolic and systolic measurements equal the blood pressure. After the measurement is completed the GP in some cases reads the numbers out loud to the patient and/or includes the results in a discussion of the fur-ther means of treatment, e.g. medication or changes in eating and drinking habits. Besides this procedure the consultation continues to treat the issue that prompted the consultation in the first place. Finally, the visit finishes and the patient leaves.
 Figure 4: The activity system for conventional hypertension treatment.

In activity theoretical terms, conventional blood pressure mea-surement can be depicted as in figure 4. The central artifacts used by the GP are the sphygmomanometer and the stethoscope. Blood pressure measurement is an activity that consists of a set of ac-tions guided by medical rules and guidelines, like correct pressure for systolic and diastolic pressure. The actions are composed by a set of operations (adjustment of the inflatable cuff, inflation of the cuff, use of stethoscope), which are based on some basic heuris-tics. The division of labor entails that the patient asks for a sched-uled time, travels to the GP, waits and makes herself available for measurements in the GP X  X  office, whereas the GP takes care of all actions concerning measurement and assessment of the patient X  X  health. The patient may be told the results of the measurements performed by the GP, but it is the GP who makes the interpretation of the result based on the internalized medical knowledge. A cen-tral characteristic of the conventional blood pressure measurement is that the subjects are co-located and that synchronous dialogue is possible. Thus the GP can incorporate bodily signs as skin color and breathing in her interpretation of the blood pressure and mis-understandings and clarifications can be handled immediately. Figure 5: A patient using the TMBP briefcase for monitoring her blood pressure.
The telemedicine activity is different from the conventional one in several ways. The activity now takes place in the home of the patient, which implies that both the blood pressure monitoring and the communication with the GP is done (mediated) by the TMBP system. Hence, the activity is now entirely tied to an interaction between the patient and the TMBP system. The measuring activity takes place anytime between 2 pm and 8 pm. Since the system is built into a briefcase and thus mobile it is often stored out of sight from visitors, e.g. in the bedroom. Most often the patient thus retrieves the briefcase, places it on the dining table and opens it as seen in figure 5. The patient then presses the power button on the PDA, rolls up her left arm sleeve and fixes the cuff on the arm. The fixing of the cuff turned out to be challenging for several of the patients. It demands a bit of finger skill: with the right arm the patient rolls two-thirds of the cuff around the left arm, fixes it with two fingers while the remaining three work to tighten the cuff around the arm. Furthermore, the fixing of the cuff is aided by a green mark that must be lined up with the vein on the elbow. The tightness of the cuff, however, is not so easily determined, but most patients claimed to have a  X  X ense X  of how tight it should be  X  sometimes checking by placing a finger between the cuff and the arm. She then presses the  X  X easure blood pressure X  button, the cuff is automatically inflated and the blood pressure is measured. This procedure is repeated three times before the results are transmitted to the server.

The new activity system for telemedicine blood pressure mea-surement is illustrated in figure 6. Compared to the activity system of conventional blood pressure measurement, we see that almost all of the constituting elements of the activity have changed. The subject of the activity is now the patient him-or herself and not the GP as before; the mediating artifact has changed to the elec-tronic TMBP setup consisting of the briefcase and the website; and the main object of the activity is no longer one measurement but a whole series of repeated, valid measurements over a longer period of time. As a consequence of embedding the project in the clinical trial, the community has been extended to include the research de-partment at the hospital and the rules have been extended to include the clinical research guidelines. Finally, the most profound change in the social setup of the activity can been seen from the division of work, where the patient now is in charge of a greater part of ac-complishing the activity, including doing the measurements and to some extend also the judgment of individual measurements. Figure 6: The transformed activity system where the patient is using the telemedicine equipment.
So far we have used activity theory to describe the changes in the blood pressure monitoring activity. In this section we will further analyze some specific parts of this activity system and put special focus on transformations in (i) the overall activity, i.e. the medical treatment; (ii) in the social division of work between the patient and the GP; (iii) in the communication patterns between the patient and the GP; (iv) in the patient X  X  perception of himself and his disease; (v) in the technical setup including the technical skills necessary for the patient to be able to measure his blood pressure. Below we shall discuss these five aspects in more detail.
The main and intended transformation of the medical treatment is a larger amount of data from which the GP can assess the pa-tient X  X  blood pressure and the effects of the medication. The GP now has a better statistical foundation upon which the medication can be planned and evaluated. Furthermore, the frequent measure-ments give the GP a means to quickly change the medication if the blood pressure of the patient increases or decreases too dras-tically. Since the measurements are conducted by the patient in the home, the telemedicine activity also eliminates the so-called white-coat syndrome where the patient X  X  blood pressure is often higher than normal due to the stress inflicted by being at the GP X  X  clinic. In these respects, the transformation of the activity system has reached its envisioned outcome. In theory, the measurements should be more accurate, but as mentioned earlier the accuracy of the measurements is highly dependent on the patients X  ability to affix the cuff correctly. If not, the results are very likely to be in-correct, which in the worst case could compromise the whole ac-tivity. Since there are no check-measurements conducted during the project there is no solid evidence as to whether the measure-ments are conducted correctly and with valid results. As already mentioned, several of the patients visited reported that the mount-ing of the cuff was a challenge and that they were not exactly sure about the rules regarding placement and tightness of the cuff. In a wider perspective, the problems with the cuff point to the need for teaching patients how to do affixation correctly in a telemedicine hypertension setup.
The transformations in the medical treatment are closely related to the transformations in the division of work, since the treatment so to speak is constituted by the different activities, actions and op-erations of the community involved  X  i.e. the work that is done. As indicated by figures 4 and 6 the overarching transformation is a shift from an activity highly driven by the GP to an activity which to a great extent is performed by the patient. This transformation is a consequence of the transfer of actions, operations and responsi-bilities from the GP to the patient.

The most significant action transferred from the GP to the pa-tient is of course the blood pressure measuring itself. This has several consequences. Firstly, it is now the patient X  X  responsibil-ity to adhere to the frequency of the measurements dictated by the GP. This is supervised by the GP via her monitoring of the results through the website. Secondly, the patient is now also responsible for the correct mounting of the cuff. This means that knowledge and expertise about this action has to be transferred from the GP to the patient. As mentioned this did not seem to have occurred with complete success in the TMBP project. Thirdly, in the con-ventional measuring activity the GP was responsible for inflating the cuff by pumping the bulb. In the telemedicine activity this ac-tion is performed by the technology, thus in this instance reducing the amount of knowledge and expertise otherwise required of the patient to perform the activity. Fourthly, the access to the results of the measurements is changed. In the conventional activity, the GP reads the result from the sphygmomanometer and to a certain degree communicated it to the patient; most often as a reformula-tion put in context such as  X  X his looks fine X , but in some cases by reading the result out loud. Due to the new division of labor, how-ever, the patient now has direct access to all the results and also to the effects of the medication through the graph on the website. Thus the patient is now much more involved in the interpretation and evaluation of the blood pressure, and the medication and its effects. Fifthly and finally, while the conventional measuring activ-ity was initiated by a series of practical and logistical actions per-formed by the patient (e.g. booking a consultation with the GP and transport from the patient X  X  home or work to the GP X  X  clinic), the telemedicine activity includes none of these, since it is performed in the home of the patient.

To summarize all these aspects we can detect a general transfor-mation of the activity from being primarily driven and performed by the GP to a form of shared practice where the two individuals cooperate actively in realizing the object of the activity. Thus the level of active, mutual cooperation is increased in the telemedicine activity.
As a consequence of the telemedicine system all communication concerning hypertension is mediated by the artifact and communi-cation is asynchronous as it consists of a series of written or spoken messages distributed over time.

This communicational pattern is different from the one in the conventional activity where the two individuals are engaged in co-located and dynamic dialogue. There are several consequences of this transformation. First of all, the telemedicine technology pro-vides an easier access between the patient and the GP, since they at anytime can send a message, thus bypassing such practical ob-stacles as opening hours, queues and so on. The field studies have shown that this easy access has resulted in an increase in commu-nication between patient and GP. However, this increase is also a result of the fact that the new style of communication is less ef-fective than the co-located communication in the clinic of the GP. This decrease in effectiveness is based on two aspects. Firstly, it is less flexible than dialogue and thus it may take more than one or two messages to clear up a point which means that the commu-nicational act takes longer time. Secondly, written or spoken mes-sages are more likely to cause misinterpretations that are harder to overcome due to aspect number one. Thus the new communication yields a higher frequency of communication, but also potentially a lower quality and misunderstandings due to the decrease in  X  X and-width X  and flexibility compared to face-to-face dialogue.
Since the new type of communication is virtual and asynchronous the  X  X resence X  of the GP is reduced to the messages that the patient receives. This presence is obviously very different from the shared presence in the physical space of the clinic. Our interviews with the patients revealed that they could accept this  X  X irtual X  presence re-garding treatment of hypertension, but would be reluctant to accept it concerning treatment of what they perceived as a more  X  X erious X  illness. Thus the study of the new communicational activity shows that the communicational role of the GP contains further aspects than just the formulation and contextualization of knowledge con-nected to the treatment of illnesses.
As shown, the telemedicine activity involves the patient to a higher degree than conventional treatment, resulting in a cooper-ative activity where the patients plays a more active role. In the TMBP project this means that the patients gain a higher level of insight into their own treatment and condition through the access to the results of the measurements and the graph showing the effect of the medicine on the blood pressure (figure 2).

Furthermore, due to the high frequency of measurements, the patients are daily or at least three times a week reminded of their hypertension when conducting the measurements. This increased involvement and focus on their own condition and treatment had different consequences for the patients involved. One patient ex-plained that his involvement in the telemedicine activity had led him to search the internet for information on hypertension and its treatment, but that the increased knowledge had not caused any change in his lifestyle. By using the technology another patient discovered that alcohol immediately decreases the pressure, but in-creases it the following day. A third patient found a way to  X  X ack X  the system, so that he could measure his blood pressure without sending the data to the server. He did this to have some  X  X rivate X  data he could use when trying to convince his wife that he was not working too hard on their farm. Summing up, none of the patients seemed to have made significant changes in their lifestyle as a con-sequence of the telemedicine activity, though it should be remem-bered that the trial had only run for a short period at the time of fieldwork. However, they all acknowledged an increased interest in their blood pressure and treatment  X  especially when perform-ing the measurements  X  and further that their level of knowledge about their condition had increased. Although none of the patients claimed that the increased interest resulted in additional stress or concern as such, the long term results of this increased focus is yet to be determined.
As the sections above illustrate, the introduction and use of the new telemedicine technology leads to transformations not only in the activity itself, but in the activity system as a whole. The tech-nology mediates the performance of the other mediating phenom-ena in the activity system, but is in two instances itself transformed in the new activity system.

The first instance can be seen in figure 5, where the patient mak-ing measurements has a piece of paper with some notes at her side. She is taking notes of all the measurements done, in order to main-tain an overview of the progress of her treatment. She does this because she does not have access to the web-page containing the aforementioned graph (figure 2). As such she transforms the tool available to her by combining it with a paper-record of all the data of the measurements. Due to the change of the activity as a whole the patient now has a new need for an overview that she did not have in the conventional activity where all responsibilities and all tasks were allocated to the GP. Since she does not have access to the full technology she transforms or extends it to fulfill this new need. The second instance is the aforementioned  X  X ack X  where a patient makes private samples which are not send to the server. In this case the patient transforms the technology in accordance with his new motive to use the technology to have some arguments in his discussions with his wife regarding the workload on the farm. It is an example of how a technology designed for a specific purpose is used in a manner unintended by the designers to meet a need of the user: the technology functions not only as a telemedicine tool, but also as a tool for gaining approval of unrelated actions from the pa-tient X  X  wife. As such there is a dialectical transformation, in which the technology and its use is transformed due to social structures and individual needs, and at the same time the technology mediates those social structures through the output it yields.
As stated in section 3 the goal of this project was to make a lit-mus test on the use of home-based monitoring and communication technology for the treatment of chronic lifestyle diseases like hy-pertension. This was divided into a medical goal of making better treatment of hypertension as well as a technical goal of creating improved technology for home-based self-treatment by patients. In this section we will discuss the implication for further design of the technology platform and especially focus on the need to sup-port flexible patient-physician cooperation, to scale the patient-to-physician ratio, to support the patient to take ownership and control the technology, and to maintain privacy and trust in these types of technologies.
Our findings from the TMBP project show that while the tech-nology increased the quality of the monitoring and treatment and saved cost and time for face-to-face consultations, it also made the patient a more active collaboration partner in the hypertension treat-ment activity. Since this collaboration is now distributed in time and space, the system setup for home-based monitoring and treat-ment need to take this into consideration.

The CSCW literature suggests that this kind of loose coupling in cooperative activities need to provide flexible coordination and cooperation mechanisms which do not enforce tighter interdepen-dencies in work [31, 36, 23]. Despites its weaknesses, the asyn-chronous communication mechanism in the TMBP project actually helped the patient and physician to communicate independently of each other. Another basic technique for supporting such loose cou-pling in cooperation is to augment shared physical space [31] or to support at shared workspace as a medium for exchanging knowl-edge [23]  X  or in more general terms to provide a common infor-mation space [4, 7]. In the TMBP case we saw how such a common information space  X  the web server  X  played a very important role for both the patient and the physician individually and in their coop-eration. This became particular evident when talking to the patient shown in figure 5, who did not have access to the web. She had to make her own  X  X nformation space X  using a hand-written record. In future design this common information space should not be  X  X id-den X  away in a browser on a PC  X  which often needs to be switched on, logged into, etc.  X  but has to be much more incorporated into the technology as such and available when e.g. monitoring the blood pressure. Social awareness [36, 11] also plays an important role in supporting this kind of loosely coupled cooperation in home-based monitoring and treatment. In the TMBP project, support for social awareness was absent which required patients and physi-cians to manually monitor changes in medical data (monitoring and medicine prescription data) and in the ongoing conversation (new responses or questions). Because these thing were  X  X idden X  in the technology, this implied that users frequently had to deliberately check the web site or the PDA. For future design, we would like to incorporate more calm or ambient awareness technologies [42] like the Ambient Agoras environment [37, 32], or the social aware-ness approach suggested in the Awarenex [38] or the AWARE Ar-chitecture [6]. In many of these systems and displays, there has been a conscious effort in designing for the  X  X eriphery X , i.e. to make the systems provide background information that does not contin-uously force the user to actively attend to it [33]. A design goal for home-based monitoring and treatment technologies is to sup-port this non-obtrusive awareness pattern of interaction [40] while still rendering the function and operation of the technology palpa-ble when needed.
One of the main arguments for homecare technologies is the emerging rise in demand for health services which cannot be meet by proportional rise in healthcare spending. Our findings from the TMBP project show an increase in the number of monitoring data and in the amount of patient-physician interaction acts  X  i.e. there were more data and more talk involved in the treatment of each pa-tient. The physicians in the project were worried about how this would scale to many patients. Compared to the conventional blood pressure monitoring activity, the telemedicine monitoring was done continuously and hence involved the GP much more frequently. The GP had to  X  X eep an eye on X  the monitoring data and the in-coming voice messages. This transformation in the work of the GP raised a range of questions: How can you get an overview of this data without sitting and staring on the screen all day? And simi-larly, how can you supervise the effect of a treatment? How do you ensure that you actually see and react upon a patient which has a critical high blood pressure? How can you judge the content of a message from a patient without having to listen to it all? How can you avoid spending all you time typing in messages for the patient? How do you account for this  X  X eeping an eye on X  patient data and hence how do you write a bill for this?
One of the main lessons from the TMBP project is thus that it is essential to design scalable homecare technologies. The TLC system [16] did have the same kind of scalability problems and the authors hence envisioned a new TLC systems that would make use of voice recognition. Voice recognition has been proposed for a system envisioned by Azzini et al. [3] and Piazza et al. [30] to enable patients with hypertension to interact with an  X  X ntelligent X  dialog system. These systems have, however, not been applied in real clinical care. In our design of future homecare technologies we are not moving towards the use of artificial intelligence but want to make technologies and interfaces which would allow the physician to handle more patients and monitoring data. An example would be to create a large interactive display in the GP X  X  office showing a map of his patients each represented by an icon or a color indicating his or her  X  X tatus X  (which is often found in medical settings [44]) and could provide access to patient communications, notes, and other resources, as done in the  X  X otification Collage X  [17].
So far we have not discussed the patient X  X  actual use and opera-tion of the TMBP artifact, i.e. the technology in the briefcase and its software. During our interview, however, we learned that the op-eration of the monitoring equipment was easy and there was only a few minor usability problems reported. This observation is sup-ported by a number of other studies. One study included a question-naire study of patient satisfaction and concluded like Friedman et al. [16] that patients found the artifact easy to use and operate [29]. Clearly, this depends on the design of the artifact but in the TMBP project it seems that the user-centered design process lead to a very useful design.

However, one thing that is interesting to notice is the apparent  X  X isuse X  of the technology. In particular, the need for taking mea-surements without sending them to the database. This may seem like a small thing, but we think that it points to a more general con-clusion: The need for designing the technology to be the property of the patient and not some technological extension of the  X  X ealth-care system X . Hence, the patient wants to, and should be able to, take ownership of homecare technology in order to make it work in his or her personal setting. This also lead to the need for de-signing for the patient to be in control of the technology and being able to understand how it works and how it relates to the rest of the  X  X orld X  outside the home of the patient. Hence, in order for home-care technology to succeed, it must be designed to be the patient X  X  device which he or she is able to understand and control. For ex-ample, it is important to be able to control which data to send, to whom, and in what details; and is should be possible to understand for the patient how the technology works  X  technically as well as organizationally.
In this paper, we presented results from interviews and field-work with patients using self-monitoring equipment for hyperten-sion treatment, and analyzed how such technology transforms the patient-physician relationship. Our findings revealed how the in-troduction of homecare technology for blood pressure monitoring and treatment fundamentally changes the patient-physician rela-tionship. The technology increased the intensity and quality in the medical treatment of hypertension while saving the patient the need for traveling to the GP X  X  office and wait there for long hours. A new division of work emerged where the patient became much more ac-tively involved in a cooperative effort together with the physician The communication pattern changed from having a rich contextual dialogue at the GP X  X  office to an asynchronous message exchange with minimal shared context, which in some case reduced the qual-ity in the dialogue. Finally, the homecare technology increased the patient X  X  self-consciousness on his hypertension and treatment. We were, however, not in this relatively short period of time able to document changes in behavior.

Our findings have some implications for the design of home-based monitoring and treatment technology. Designers must care-fully consider the role that homecare technology is playing in a loosely coupled collaborative setup between the patient and the physician. Neglecting this cooperative aspect of homecare tech-nology may lead to systems which do not provide the needed sup-port for communication, coordination, knowledge sharing, and mu-tual awareness. Designers must also carefully consider the patient-physician ratio in order to make technology which scale properly. A third implication for the design of homecare technology is also to design for patients to take ownership and control by making the technology and its network of use comprehensible in use.
These findings and implications for design are rooted in view-ing home-based monitoring and treatment not as a single-user task done by the patient but viewed as part of an overall collaborative activity system which also includes the physician and potentially also some hospital. When adopting this view on the TMBP project, but also homecare technology in general, it becomes important to discuss what type of cooperation homecare technologies estab-lish; what their consequences are for the medicine practice in gen-eral, and in particular for the patients and health care professionals whose practice is transformed. Based on the presented work, we will argue that CSCW methodology can help us design ubiquitous healthcare monitoring technology, which focuses not just on the technologies and their intended use, but also on their impact on co-operation, organization and other sociological phenomena. This, we think, is an important lesson both for the CSCW and the Ubi-Comp community.
