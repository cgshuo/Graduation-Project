Cambridge, MA, USA michael_muller@us.ibm.com Whether in private or professio nal life, individuals frequently adapt the technology around them and work with what they have at hand to accomplish a certain task. In this one -day workshop, we will discuss how this form of technology appropriation is used to satisfy communication needs. Thereby, we specifically focus on technology that was not intended to facilitate communication, but which led to appropriation driven by individuals  X  communication needs . Our aim is to identify  X  X nexpected X  communication needs, to better address these in the design of interactive systems . We focus on a variety of different contexts, ranging from not restricted contexts to environments that are characterized by strict regulations (e.g., production lines with 24/7 shift production cycles) . Consequently, this workshop aims at better understanding how users adapt technology to match their individual communication purposes and how these appropriation practices interrelate with and support organizational cooperation. H.5.m. Inf ormation interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): Miscellaneous. Keywords: Technology appropriation;  X  X nexpected X  communication needs; special contexts. Conclusions from various user studies, in particular withi n Computer -Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Information Systems (IS) research, propose to investigate appropriation processes within practice, from theoretical (e.g., [6], [9]) but also bottom -up observational perspectives (e.g., [22] , [23] ). Such field -driven, observational user studies, many of those published within CHI an d CSCW conferences, have drawn attention to particular cases in which individuals  X  complete the design through their actions  X  [12] , as they adapt the technologies around them in ways that have not initially been intended by the designers [1]. These investigations range from everyday appropriation practices in private (e.g., [4], [11] ) and business settings (e.g., [5], [16] , [17] ) to highly challenging and specific contexts that go beyond traditional work/office environments (e.g., [2], [6], [7]). However, understanding and conceptualizing these application contexts an d domains [5], and in particular reflecting upon experiences regarding appropriation practices w ithin these respective contexts is critical when it comes to the abstraction of knowledge to provide an informed ba sis [3], of how to design for the  X  X nexpected X . Our proposed workshop aims at extracting and consolidating  X  X uccessful X  and  X  X nsuccessful X  technology appropriation experiences from a wide range of application c ontexts . Interrelating these technology appropriation experiences with the context of use is of particular importance in order to actually understand the situated nature of interaction [14] . Therefore, w e consider highly specific contexts (e.g., production lines with 24/7 shift production cycles or safety critical contexts such as cars) particularly interesting, as they are frequently characterized by strict regulations that are defined to avoid appropriation pra ctices. However, throughout our own research activities, we came to understand that even in these restricted environments, technology appropriation happens for various reasons, and one of these is the need for communication. Some research draws particular attention to the importance of the social context and the conditions in which appropriation is actually happening (e.g., [19] , [21] ). Following Draxler et al. ( [21] , p. 2835) appropriation can be considered  X  X s being highly cooperative, situated, socially embedded, and often connected to particular work situations X  . Here, appropriation itself is seen as a highly social activ ity, which is embedded in very specific context -related situations wherein the technology adaption is mostly performed between peers or colleagues [21] . Accordingly, appropriation should be understood as a phenomenon that is characterized by many creative and collaborative activities [10] . Whereas appropriation may be regarded as a social phenomenon itself , our workshop in particular strives to investigate technology appropriation for MEETING SOCIAL PURPOSES , i.e., communication and cooperation. Therefore,  X  X nexpected X  communication requirements need to be identified and consolidated through looking at users X  appropriation behavior. Here, communication needs that were satisfied through appropriating the technology may be considered as  X  X uccessful X ; however, also  X  X nsuccessful X , i.e., appropriation that aimed, but did not result in, satisfied communication needs, are of relevance. Thereby, not only experiences with unant icipated use, but also unanticipated users (e.g., [8], [17] [18] ) may be discussed in the workshop, which might provide a further understanding of appropriation in specific contexts. Dix [1] and Carroll [12] highlight that  X  X esign can never be complete X  as it is impossible to design for the  X  X nexpected X , but that  X  X ou can design to allow the unexpected  X . These appropriation practices then constitute the basis for the d esign and implementation of technology innovations [12] . Consequently, they may be considered an essential and positive phenomenon ([1], [12] , [14] , [20] ). In line with this perspective, our proposed workshop is not aiming to derive concrete design implications, but to reflect on experiences with such  X  X nexpected X  communication requirements identified through technology appropriation to provide an informe d basis for research and design. Previous related workshops within the CHI and CSCW community have mai nly concentrated on CSCW -and IS -oriented theories and topics . Those workshops aim ed at finding systematic approaches to map existing research in order to strive for future research agendas [25] , identifying approaches of community appropriation through involving participants in a process of design and appropriation as a sustainability through reuse [13] . Another workshop at CHI aimed at bridging the persisting gap between user s, researchers and designers within ap propriations research, in order to unite observations and theoretical viewpoints with practical design efforts [3]. In contrast to these workshops, we explicitly attempt to consolidate and extract experiences t hat particularly focus on individuals X  communication needs and how these potentially  X  X nexpected X  needs have been satisfied through the users adaption of the technology at hand. Our focus in the proposed workshop furthermore includes contexts with specific characteristics, such as restricted production industries , as exploring the context of use is necessary to actually understand the situated nature of interaction [14] . In an earlier workshop at CSCW [15] , we have discussed collaboration activities in challenging environments. While one might argue that restricted contexts do not allow appropriation, as for instance, users are strongly urged to follow the rules, we fou nd in our own research that there is nevertheless a variety of appropriation behavior to facilitate communication, which indicates unfulfilled needs. This one -day workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with a var iety of backgrounds (e.g., Social S ciences, design of collaborative systems, etc.), who share an interest in understanding technology appropriation to satisfy communication needs. The workshop addresses the following goals and questions: Identifying appro priation practices: Relating appropriation practices to communication needs: Embedding practices and needs into the context: In order to discuss these questions, we invite position papers to the following topics (but are not limited to): The goal of the worksho p is to share and discuss experiences around the above -mentioned topics, as well as to explore future potentials of addressing expected and unexpected communication needs in varying contexts. This is a one -day workshop with break -out sessions, alternated with moderated group discussions. After a short introduction to the workshop topic by the organizers, the workshop will mainly focus on the participants X  experiences about the topic. Participants will briefly present themselves and the ir stance on the workshop topic. In this part , the organizers will also outline their own observational experiences and reflections on the topic (e.g., within a production context employees have appropriated technology for their own communication purposes, thereby revealing  X  X nexpected X  communication needs).
 In a break-out session the participants will then try to identify technology appropriations and their relating  X  X nexpected X  communication needs. The workshop organizers will provide guiding questions to be answered within the break -out sessions to stimulate the participants thinking about this topic. In the afternoon the break -out session will continue, asking the participants to reflect upon successful work -arounds for enabling and supporting communicat ion and in particular how these technology appropriations can be characterized. Throughout this identification and characterization process, the participants are also asked to reflect upon the potentials for design, and in particular what researchers and p ractitioners can learn from these appropriation strategies. The workshop organizers will actively take part in the break -out sessions to stimulate discussion and bring together the participants X  experiences. The outcome of the break -out sessions X  will the n briefly be presented. Finally, a plenary discussion will be held to critically reflect on challenges and potentials. The goal is to provide an abstracted knowledge basis for future support of communication needs through technology. Th e workshop organizers will consider the publication of revised version s of accepted papers as part of a spe cial issue in a CSCW related journal. In order to be considered for publication in this special issue, papers will have to be resubmitted and undergo a reviewing process with external reviews. We encourage the participation of researchers and practitioners from different communities and with various backgrounds in order to foster interdisciplinary discussions . These include academics, ind ustrial researchers and designers but also other practitioners that have any kind of experience in technology appropriation to satisfy communication need s. In order to encourage exchange and interaction between all participants the maximum group size i s set between 15 to 20 participants. Submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organizers with support of other researchers forming a dedicated program committee . The submissions will be selected according to their significance and their potential to st imulate discussion. A mixture of academic and industrial participants is anticipated and will be ensured by the organizers background and networks. The workshop organizers have previous experience in setting up related events at conferences such as CHI , No rdiCHI, CSCW, MobileHCI, and IDC. For conducting the w orkshop we will require a projector, flip charts, power strips and associated electricity, and Internet connectivity.
