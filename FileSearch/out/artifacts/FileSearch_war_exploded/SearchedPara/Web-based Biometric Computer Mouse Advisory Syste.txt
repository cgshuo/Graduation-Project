 1. Introduction
As the tempo of contemporary life quickens along with the increasing rates of competition on the job market, unc ertainty about the future and continual demands for greater competency, the risk of experiencing stress unavoidably rises. Research studies have shown that, at work, if stressors are especially intense, the speed of processing information decreas es by as much as 30 X 50 percent. Thus, on the job, a person is unable to focus attention, makes many mistakes, suffers memory lapses, frequently feels tired, speaks tersely at bubbling speed, loses satisfaction in activities and is either constantly hungry or lacks appetite. Typical illnesses caused by stress are hypertension, stomach and intes tinal ulcers, migraine headaches, heart (myocardial) attack and certain immuno-allergic illnesses.
People are also most interested in resolving and managing various emotions (self-control, happiness, anger, fear, sadness, surprise and anxiety), mood and the level of interest in work during specific times, in addition to the aforementioned stress levels and work productivity. The latest worldwide studies show that these eleven states of a person X  X  being, under study herein, can be determined by applying three main biometric techniques (physiological, psychological and behavioral).

Physiological signals can provide information regarding the intensity and quality of an individual X  X  internal affect experience ( Zimmermann et al., 2003 ). A physiological trait tends to be a more stable physical characteristic, such as a fingerprint, skin conductance, heart rate, blood vessel pattern in the hand, blood pressure, respiration, face or back of the eye, electroencephalo-graphy or muscle action.
 especially in relation to behavior, e motion, cognition and personality.
Emotion is a transient psychological, physiological and behavioral response to thoughts, event s and social activities ( Mustafa et al., 2008 ). Emotions can be defined as feelings, such as happiness, sadness, anger, elation, irritation and others ( Real Voices, 2009 ).
Diverse writers have proposed that there are from two to twenty  X  X  X asic emotions X  X  ( Plutchik, 1980 ). As per the opinions of
Zimmermann et al. (2003) , self-reports are widely used and still serve as a primary method for ascertaining emotion and mood. behave in a given situation based on established protocols, rules of conduct or accepted social practices (ASQ Glossary). A broad field of behavioral methods can measure affect: facial expressions, voice modulation, gestures, posture, cognitive performance, cognitive strategy, motor behavior (e.g., hand muscles, head movement) and others ( Zimmermann et al., 2003 ). A behavioral characteristic reflects an individual X  X  psychology. Different methods (e.g., voice stress analysis, face recognition and others) are used in practice. formed and quite many systems have been developed that apply biometric technologies to establish different human states of being. The global innovativeness of the Advisory system, devel-oped by the authors herein, is primarily that it automatically determines the level of stress (work productivity), compiles numerous alternative recommendations applicable to a specific user (how to reduce stress or/and in crease productivity), performs a multiple criteria analysis of thes e recommendations and selects out the ten most rational ones for that user. No other system in the world performs these functions to date.
 level of negative stress and resolve the problem for lessening it. It can help in managing a currently stressful situation and mini-mizing future stress by making the level of future needs satisfac-tion more rational. First, the Advisory system facilitates individuals in making real-time assessments of their stress levels and receiving rational tips to reduce the level of current stress based on the best global practice accumulated therein. Multi-variant design and multiple criteria analysis methods are used for that purpose. The generation of recommendations and the selection of the most rational are based on criteria systems and on Maslow X  X 
Hierarchy of Needs ( Maslow, 1943 , 1954 ). Since this is an inter-disciplinary area of research, psych ologists, philosophers and experts in information management, decision-making theories and intelligent and biometric technologies participated in the development of the Advisory system.

Dependency of human blood pressures, heart rate, skin conductance and temperature on experienced stress and emotions
A comprehensive analysis was performed by the authors of this article on how blood pressures, heart rate, skin conductance and body temperature depend on the stress and emotions that a person experiences. Table 1 summarizes the results of this analysis. The detailed explanations of this table appear further in this section along with a discussion on the conformance of the studies performed by these authors with results achieved worldwide. 2.1. Effect of experienced emotions on blood pressure, heart rate, skin conductance and body temperature
Since systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate and skin conductance directly associate with a person X  X  emotional state and experiences, the studies conducted worldwide on this topic and published in scientific literature were analyzed for this article.
Numerous scientists have examined the dependency of systo-lic and diastolic blood pressures on human emotions. Written sources generally refer to five types of emotions: self-control, happiness, anger, fear and sadness. Many scientists tested blood pressure dependency on a person X  X  emotional state and found that both the diastolic and systolic blood pressures rise most, when a person experiences anger as compared to the other, aforementioned four types of emotions ( Albert, 1953 ; Schwartz et al., 1981 ; Averill, 1969 ; Weerts and Roberts, 1976 ; Cohen and
Cohen, 1975 ; Funkenstein et al., 1954 ; Schachter, 1957 ; Cacioppo et al., 1997 ). The results obtained from the research described herein are compared with the research conducted worldwide.
For example, Schwartz et al. (1981) examined the dependency of systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate on emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, self-control and relaxa-tion). This research employed dispersion analysis and the
Newman (1939) and Keuls (1952) test of calculations to process the results. The research results indicate that diastolic blood pressure rises much more, when a person is angry than when a person experiences the other, aforementioned types of emotions.
Anger causes diastolic blood pressure to rise by as much as happiness does, and sadness  X  by as much as self-control does.
The only emotional state that causes diastolic blood pressure to drop is relaxation. The authors of this study obtained the same results while conducting the research presented herein and tracking the blood pressure readings and emotional changes of the experiment subjects. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures of the subjects rose (see Fig. 1 a).

Weerts and Roberts (1976) employed imagery to induce anger and happiness artificially in the subjects of their experiment.
Their research found that diastolic blood pressure increased significantly more in a state of anger than it did in a state of fear.
Averill (1969) tested fluctuations in blood pressure by analyzing people X  X  reactions while watching a film about J.F. Kennedy after his death. Averill claims, in the research conclusions, that diastolic blood pressure sharply increases when experiencing anger whereas it remains unchanged under states of happiness and self-control. Numerous authors substantiate the claim that diastolic blood pressure remains stable under states of happiness, fear or sadness or that it rises but not as significantly as it does under a state of anger ( Schwartz et al., 1981 ; Averill, 1969 ; Ekman et al., 1983 ; Weerts and Roberts, 1976 ; Albert, 1953 ).

Ekman et al. (1983) and Levenson et al. (1997) were the first to publish about the dependency of heart rate, finger temperature and skin conductance on the emotional state of a person in a Science article in 1983. These scholars analyzed six emotional states: anger, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise and disgust. Ekman et al. (1983) thoroughly researched heart rate and its sharp rise under states of anger, fear and sadness as compared to a state of disgust. They also established that happiness, as compared to disgust, associates with an increased heart rate. Under a state of disgust, the heart rate remains the same as it does under self-control. Their research showed that anger and fear cause greater skin conductance than happiness does. Later Levenson et al. (1997) performed a number of studies and experiments arguing that heart rate increases the most when feeling negative emotions, such as anger, fear and sadness.
According to Albert (1953) , there are greater diastolic blood pressure rises, heart rate decreases and skin conductance increases, when anger is experienced rather than when fear and, particularly, surprise are. Cacioppo et al. (1997) assert that skin conductance increases less relative to the state of happiness than it does relative to disgust; however, in this case, the state of disgust is the same as self-control is. Under fear, skin conductance increases less than it does under sadness, whereas the level of skin conductance drops more under sadness than it does under anger or disgust. Levenson et al. (1997) concluded, upon perfor-mance of their research, that skin conductance decreases under states of fear and disgust whereas it increases the most under states of happiness and surprise.

Crosby et al. (2001) and Ekman et al. (1983) discussed the dependence of a person X  X  finger temperature on six main emo-tions (surprise, disgust, sadness, anger, fear and happiness). The research result attained by Crosby et al. (2001) , who deliberated the emotions of happiness, sadness and surprise, substantiated the findings of Ekman et al. (1983) that, when a person feels happy or sad, body temperature rises and, when surprised, body temperature falls. However, when examining anger and fear, the results were conflicting. Ekman et al. (1983) claimed that, when a person feels angry, body temperature rises and, when afraid, body temperature drops; meanwhile, Crosby et al. (2001) claimed the opposite. Ekman et al. (1983) claimed that, with finger tempera-ture, the change associated with anger was significantly different than it was with the other emotions.
 (2006) studied the dependency of body temperature on happiness and established that a person X  X  body temperature rises when that person is happy. Ekman et al. (1983) and Crosby et al. (2001) found similar results.
 temperature on three emotions (fear, happiness and sadness), they determined that emotion had the main and significant effect on the temperature of the left little finger. Their study revealed that fear, as compared to happiness, affected a decreased temperature. No other significant temperature differences were observed with these three emotions. One finding of Krumhansl (1997) and Stemmler et al. (2001) was that the skin temperature of the left little finger dropped under the state of fear as compared to the happy state. Another finding was that respiration rates dropped in the sad state as compared to the happy and fear states.
McFarland (1985) and Rimm-Kaufman and Kagan (1996) studied the dependency of body temperature on positive and negative emotions (without more specific differentiation). They established that, when a musical selection played to arouse negative emotions, it stopped skin temperature increases and induced decreases whereas, when music played to evoke calm, positive emotions, it stopped skin temperature decreases and evoked increases. Rimm-Kaufman and Kagan (1996) played film clips intended to evoke a happy state, and these affected an increase in hand skin temperature. Hands generate greater temperature changes than those on face skin do. Further, this research found that most subjects were cooler on the left side of the face and on the left hand than they were on the right side of face and the right hand.
 2.2. Dependence of blood pressures and heart rate on a person X  X  experienced stress
Statistics show that the cost of work-related stress in the EU countries is no less than 20 billion Euros annually. Stress on the job can cause depression, anxiety, increased chronic fatigue and heart disease. This has tremendous effects on work productivity, creativity and competitiveness.

Worldwide scientific research has shown that stress causes increased blood pressure and that heart rate increases during stressful times. Light et al. (1999) analyzed cases of daily and of heavy stress as well as their effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure fluctuations. Gray et al. (2007) investigated the effect of psychological stress on systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Adrogue  X  and Madias (2007) described the effects of psychological, emotional and chronic stress on blood pressure. All of these scholars unanimously concluded that diastolic as much as systolic blood pressure and heart rate are dependent on stress and increase depending on the level of stress.

The results from the research presented in this article show that increases in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures occur depending on the strength of the stress experi-enced (see Fig. 1 b X  X ).

Blair et al. (1959) researched the effect of stress on heart rate and concluded that heart rate rises sharply in 3 min after stress strikes and only begins to fall after another 5 X 6 min pass. The article by Gasperin et al. (2009) concludes that chronic stress has an effect on high blood pressure. The results from a number of studies showed that patients with a pulse count higher than 70 beats/min are more likely to develop heart and blood vessel diseases or to die from them. Tests have proven that a rapid pulse rate increases the risk of death by 34 percent, of myocardial infarction (heart attack) by 46 percent and of heart insufficiency by 56 percent.

Briese (1992) and Okada et al. (2007) discussed stress and body temperature dependencies in animals. They assert that, under stress, animals experience a rise in temperature.
Briese (1992) claims that changes in ambient temperature should not affect changes in core temperature due to set-point shifts. Nevertheless, when the colonic temperature of rats was taken in a cold environment, the usual emotional rise was higher and, when the colonic temperature was taken in a warm envir-onment, the emotional rise was lower. The results of Briese (1992) contradict the hypothesis that an emotionally induced rise in the temperature of rats is a fever. Okada et al. (2007) exposed rats to restrained stress for 60 min. Biting on a wooden stick while restrained significantly inhibited the rise in core temperature for 30, 60, 120 and 180 min, as compared to rats that were restrained but did not bite anything.

However, the results gained from all the studies were not the same. For example, Nakayama et al. (2005) monitored facial temperature changes of monkeys under stressful and threatening conditions. Their study revealed that a decrease in nasal skin temperature is relevant to a change from a neutral to a negative affective state. Vianna and Carrive (2005) monitored temperature changes in rats when they were experiencing fearful situations. They observed that temperature increased in certain body parts (i.e., eyes, head and back) while, in other body parts (i.e., tail and paws), temperature dropped simultaneously.

Most findings indicate that the psychological stress-induced rise in core temperature is a fever, a rise in the thermoregulatory set point. Thus these mechanisms might be involved in psycho-genic fever in humans ( Oka et al., 2001 ).

The research performed by the authors of this article analyzing the dependency between stress and palm temperature, substan-tiated the results gained by Briese (1992) , Okada et al. (2007) and Oka et al. (2001) that temperature rises in a stressful situation.
Fig. 1 e displays the results of this research and shows that, as stress rises, the palm temperature of a person also rises. 3. Web-based Biometric Computer Mouse Advisory System to Analyze a User X  X  Emotions and Work Productivity
The Web-based Biometric Computer Mouse Advisory System to Analyze a User X  X  Emotions and Work Productivity (i.e., Advisory system) consists of nine subsystems: 1. e-Self-Assessment 2. Biometric computer mouse 3. Mouse Events Capture, Collection and Feature Extraction 4. Biometric Finger 5. User X  X  biometric database 6. Maslow X  X  pyramid tables 7. Model-base management and model base 8. User X  X  interdependence between biometric and self-assess-ment parameters 9. Graphic interface
The subsystems are briefly analyzed below. 3.1. e-Self-assessment subsystem
Numerous studies have been conducted worldwide that analyze the reliability of self-assessment. There are many controver-sial opinions on this issue. For example, in the opinion of Matsuno (2009) , a number of researchers have reported high correlations between user-and teacher-assessments, while other studies have shown low correlations between them. Despite meta-analyses of self-assessment in higher education deeming that users will be able to self-assess accurately, the reported correlations between self and tutor evaluations within medical PBL programs are uniformly low ( Papinczak et al., 2007 ). A great many researchers ( AlFallay, 2004 ; Braak, 2004 ; Fitzgerald et al., 2003 ; Marsh et al., 1979 ; Mynttinen et al., 2009 ; Sung et al., 2009 ; Xiao and Lucking, 2008 and others) reached reliable results proving that the reliability of self-assessment is sufficient. Due to the experiences of these authors, including the authors of this article, a decision was made to gain information about a user X  X  personal mood, productivity, stress and seven emotions (self-control, happiness, anger, fear, sadness, surprise and anxiety) among other matters by means of self-assessment.

The authors herein based their developed Advisory system on the presumption that, by assigning a user self-assessment ques-tions and then searching for the interdependency with that user X  X  biometric parameters at that time, it is possible to determine this interlink rather accurately. In other words, a user internally senses the value of the rating regarding his/her own personal mood, productivity, stress, the above-named seven emotions and such. Existing experiences and intuition give users a rather accurate indication about their personal mood, productivity, stress and the seven emotions under analysis.

Before starting the work, a user must subjectively assess his/her own personal mood, productivity, stress and the already named seven emotions and must select an expected mark, when the test is for an examination, or to assess the interest in work, when it is for a job and suchlike, by using the e-Self-Assessment questionnaire. The user conducts the self-analysis by attributing values to each of these parameters (mood, work productivity, stress level, temperament, interest in work and such) on a ten-point scale. The self-analysis questionnaire is shown in Fig. 2 . The self-analysis data remains confidential.

 the interdependency, at the time of a user X  X  self-assessment, between the eleven pieces of data submitted about that user X  X  own state of being and eighteen of that user X  X  biometric parameters (see Table 2 ). For example, an analysis of a user X  X  stress level is an effort to determine and then outline the inter-dependency between that user X  X  ei ghteen biometric parameters (see Table 2 ).
 3.2. Biometric computer mouse
This biometric computer mouse is able to measure the tem-perature and humidity of a user X  X  hand, skin conductance, touch intensity and heart rate. These biometric parameters give more information about the user and help to evaluate that user X  X  general emotional state and work productivity.

The biometric computer mouse, which the authors herein have developed, is presented in Fig. 3 . The schematic diagram of the sensors section of a biometric computer mouse is presented in Fig. 4 . The USB microcontroller PIC18F2458 with an internal 12-bit ADC reads the signals from two pressure (force) points, skin temperature, skin conductance, humidity and heart rate sensor. After reading these signals, the microcontroller calculates the values of pressure (force), temperature and humidity and sends these data to the computer through its USB port. The microcon-troller is connected to the computer through the AT43301 USB hub, which multiplexes data from the microcontroller and mouse IC to one channel; thus, only one USB cable for both sensors and the mouse is sufficient.
 The Type TC1047A temperature sensor (Microchip Technology Inc., USA) is used to measure skin temperature. The TC1047A is a linear output temperature sensor with an output voltage that is directly proportional to the measured temperature ( TC1047A linear output temperature sensor specification, 2009 ). Fig. 5 shows the calibration curve (including tolerance limits) of the tempera-ture sensor, as per the manufacturer X  X  data. The maximal tempera-ture measurement error calculates at 7 2 1 C. Each sensor was calibrated for the experiments herein. The maximal temperature measurement error, which depends on the calibration error, is about 7 0.5 1 C. It is evident that the temperature of skin is noticeably lower than body temperature is (at about 36.5 1 only the change in skin temperature is a significant parameter.
The electrical resistance of skin was measured by obtaining the current flowing between two flat metallic contacts (each about 3mm 2 in area). These contacts were mounted onto the casing of the mouse at a distance of 4 mm from each other, and a constant, 3 V voltage was charged between these contacts.

Pulse rate is measured by applying the oximetry principle, which is based on the measurement of oxygen concentration changes in the blood due to the blood pulsations in finger capillaries ( Severingham and Kelleher, 1992 ). Oxygen concentra-tion in blood is measured by the degrees of light absorption. 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 iOutput, mV
A light-emitting diode and photodiode were used for this purpose (see Fig. 6 ). The diodes were mounted on a special holder that was attached to the right side of the mouse case.
 a DC voltage output and 20 X 100 percent relative humidity measurement range (Sencera Co. Ltd., Taiwan) was used in the mouse ( Humidity module, 2010 ). The output of the sensor was 0.8 X 3.9 V in relative humidity ranges of 30 X 80 percent. computer mouse. The first was the micro-machined pressure sensor designed by the Semiconductor Physics Institute (Vilnius, Lithuania) ( Stankevic  X  and  X  Simkevic  X  ius 2000 ) and the second  X  the Type HSSF015 pressure sensor (Hope Microelectronics Co. Ltd.,
China) ( Relative pressure sensor, 2010 ). The pressure sensors were modified to measure force. The design of the force sensor is shown in Fig. 7 . The force sensor consists of: 1  X  a silicon chip, 2  X  an FR4 epoxy fiberglass carrier with 3  X  contact pads, 4  X  a metallic cap, 5  X  protective gel, 6  X  a plastic tube and 7  X  external plastic plate. This plate was fastened by means of 8  X  a silicon rubber to 6  X  the tube. When the finger acts on the external plate, it moves 9  X  the epoxy layer and activates the silicon chip through the gel. It was found that the force sensor of such a design has a linear output characteristic of up to 4 N. 3.3. Mouse Events Capture, Collection and Feature Extraction Subsystem mented in Collection and Feature Extraction Subsystem (hereafter referenced as the Mouse Events subsystem). Mouse Events Capture is handled by a background process; therefore, it is hidden from the user. The global system hook is used to track mouse events. The
Mouse Events subsystem was developed by the authors to enable the remote visualization of user activity in a page and record this information to determine user X  X  real time behavioral information.
All the measured parameters are captured when a user works with the computer and stored in a CSV format in an excel file as raw data. Raw data consists of mouse clicks and movements, as well as moments when a hand simply rests on the mouse. Each time the user clicks and moves the mouse or holds his/her hand on the mouse, the Mouse Events Subsystem collects and stores the raw data respectively in a csv file. Any event of mouse use is recorded, whether the mouse is moved, dragged and dropped, clicked (pressed or released) or simply hand-held. The time of the event is recorded in milliseconds. The X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer on the screen are recorded. A text file is being generated continuously in a csv format.

Once captured the raw data is then processed and displayed in various graphs. Each curve is described by the following set of features: size, length, speed, acceleration, curvature and the like.
The tracking of mouse events makes it possible to determine the coordinates of the mouse pointer on the screen while the mouse is moving, the coordinates of mouse clicks and the parameters of scrolling. These are the basic mouse events, but these parameters are insufficiently informative to determine the peculiarities of mouse motions.

Several additional parameters are calculated using basic mouse events. Those parameters are the speed, acceleration and oscillation of the mouse pointer. These parameters provide more information about mouse motions than the basic ones do.
The speed of the mouse pointer is the distance covered by the pointer during a fixed time period. It is possible to use Euclidean or Minkowski distance to calculate the speed of the mouse pointer D  X  D
E is the Euclidean distance, x i and y i are the coordinates of two analised points.
 D M  X  9 x 2 x 1 9  X  9 y 2 y 1 9 D
M is the minkowski (Manhattan) distance, x i and y i are the coordinates of two analised points.

The acceleration is calculated as the difference between the current speed and the speed measured during the previous time period. a  X  s t s t 1
The parameter of the hand tremble indicates the oscillation of the mouse pointer. This parameter is calculated as follows:
Ten values of the mouse pointer X  X  coordinates are stored ( C i ( x i , y i ), i  X  1 y 10).

The differences between neighboring coordinate values are calculated. d xi  X  x i x i 1 , i  X  2 y 10; d yi  X  y i y i 1
The minimum and the maximum differences are estimated
If the minimum and the maximum differences are of different signs, then the average value of stored coordinate values is calculated  X  A x  X  X  P 10 i  X  1 x i  X  = 10 , A y  X  X  P 10 i  X  1 maximum deviation from the average is estimated  X  dev x  X  dev y  X  X  :
If the deviation is small enough ( dev r k ), the movement of the pointer is treated as shaking.

The value of the shaking parameter k can be changed according to the user and the mouse type.

Several features are stored for later comparison and analysis with the biometric computer mouse movement. These can be used to develop a model of a user X  X  work productivity and emotional state. Currently the Mouse Events Subsystem collects data on the following parameters for correlations with a user X  X  emotional state and work productivity: speed of mouse pointer X  X  movement; acceleration of mouse pointer X  X  movement; amplitude of hand tremble; scroll wheel use; right-and left-click frequency; idle time.

All these data are accumulated in the mouse tracking databases. 3.4. Biometric Finger
The Biometric Finger collects data on the following parameters for correlations with a user X  X  emotional state and work productivity: humidity (humidity sensor); electrogalvanic skin conductance (electrogalvanic skin response sensors); skin temperature (thermistor); heart rate (pulse sensor).
 The schematic diagram of the sensors section of the Biometric Finger is presented in Fig. 8 . The signals from the skin tempera-ture, resistance, humidity and heart rate sensors were read by the microcontroller PIC18F2458 with an internal 12-bit ADC. After reading these signals, the microcontroller calculates the values of skin temperature, humidity, resistance and pulse count and then sends the data to the computer via USB.

All sensors and the pulse signal amplification and filtering circuit were mounted on a 15 25 mm 2 printed circuit board (PCB) (see Fig. 9 ). The board is covered with resin and can be attached to any finger with a Velcro strip. The microcontroller and the supporting circuit are also mounted on a PCB, which can be attached to the wrist with a Velcro strip.
 The Type TC1047A temperature sensor (Microchip Technology Inc., USA) was used to measure skin temperature. The Type 808H5V5 capacitive humidity sensor was used in the Biometric Finger (see Section 3.2). The electrical resistance of skin was measured in the same manner as in biometric mouse.

Pulse rate was measured using the finger plethysmography (pulse oximetry) method. Absorption of infrared radiation is dependent on blood volume and oxygen saturation in arterial blood and tissue. An infrared (IR) light emitting diode (LED) was used as the radiation source, and a sensitive IR photo-detector TSL262R was used to detect reflected radiation. Output voltage of a photo-detector is proportional to the intensity of reflected IR radiation. The voltage was sampled and sent to a PC in real-time.
Digital signal processing techniques were used to get the pulse rate data from the raw signal.

The Type 808H5V5 capacitive humidity sensor (module) with DC voltage output and 20 X 100 percent relative humidity measurement range (Sencera Co. Ltd., Taiwan) was used for the
Biometric Finger. The output of the sensor was 0.8 X 3.9 V in 30 X 80 percent relative humidity ranges. 3.5. User X  X  Biometric Database
Once a user fills out the e-Self-Assessment questionnaire and clicks on the button labeled  X  X  X tart working X  X , the biometric computer mouse and Biometric Finger begin to gather the biometric data of that user for storage in the User X  X  Biometric
Database. This way the biometric parameters of different users with different emotional states, temperaments and work produc-tivity rates are collected in the database. Different biometric parameters have been tested for correlations between the user X  X  emotions, work productivity and such and the e-Self-Assessment.
Each user can view his/her biometric parameters and their interrelationships with the e-Self-Assessment parameters. Fig. 10 shows a typical historical report on the correlation between historical work productivity (horizontal axis by points) and the touch intensity (pressure) on the mouse, when a user presses down on the mouse button (vertical axis). 3.6. Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables
Ensuring employee work efficiency includes maintaining good quality work environments and work conditions as well as sufficiently satisfying needs, such as physiological, safety, social and self-actualization (self-expression) needs along with esteem and recognition. In other words, the internal and external work environments of the employee must be motivating.
 provides energy as well as directs and maintains human behavior.
Employee motivation is one of the three most difficult tasks encountered by the employer who wants to manage a business successfully. Dubin (1958) defines motivation as a certain some-thing that pushes a person to act and continues pushing once the activity starts. One of the most popular theories of needs is Abraham Maslow X  X  Hierarchy of Needs ( Maslow, 1943 ). understanding the needs that humans strive to satisfy. According to the theory proposed by Maslow, there are five levels of needs, which determine human behavior ( Maslow, 1954 ): leads to safety needs, the satisfaction of this leads to social needs and so forth up the pyramid.

One of the results of Maslow X  X  theory is the fact that the higher level needs  X  esteem and self-actualization  X  substantially affect behavior, because satisfaction of the other needs intensifies these.
The importance of lower level needs decreases in the process of their satisfaction. Thus, a salary plan for employees should be developed in a way that would help an individual go from one level of needs to another. In practice this means that the role of management is to help an employee find meaning in his/her work and improve his/her potential to the maximum. Maslow substan-tially contributed to a better understanding of the nature of human behavior at work.

The basis for the compilation of Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables involves ethical, psychological, economic, esthetic, technical, technological, legal and social needs as well as other aspects such as comfort (see Fig. 11 ).

Respondent surveys and analyses of the best global practices provide the information for Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables (see Fig. 12 ).
Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables were developed for a regular employee working with a computer in a typical organization.

The literature based on the Maslow Theory was used to compile the tables relative to Maslow X  X  Pyramid. These tables provide information and recommendations about physiological, safety, social/recognition, esteem and self-expression/self-actua-lization needs. They include the following segments: names and significances of needs and their components, questions given to users, subjective and objective assessments of such questions, recommendations and the source of those recommendations. Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables, based both on the developed Maslow X  X  Pyramid and on the models from the Model Base, provide recommendations on how to improve a user X  X  work efficiency and how to reduce stress. 3.7. Model-base Management System and Model Base
The Model-base consists of the following models: model to determine the correlation between the user X  X  seven emotions (self-control, happiness, anger, fear, sadness, surprise and anxiety), mood, stress, work productivity and interest in work and the parameters of the user X  X  physiology, psychology and behavior/movement (Model for Dependence
Analysis); model to automatically evaluate the user X  X  seven emotions (self-control, happiness, anger, fear, sadness, surprise, anxiety), mood, work productivity, stress and interest in work; model to determine initial criteria weights (data and user characteristics and recommendations) using expert evaluation methods; model to determine criteria weights (data from Maslow X  X 
Pyramid Tables and a user X  X  biometric characteristics); module to develop the model of a user X  X  work productivity and emotional state; model to design multi-variant recommendations; model to analyze multiple criteria and to prioritize reco-mmendations; model to determine the utility degree of recommendations; model to deliver the recommendations.
 The models are briefly reviewed below.

First, the Advisory system coll ects information about a user X  X  physiological, psychological and behavioral/movement parameters and accumulates them in the User X  X  Biometric Database. Then the
Interdependency Analysis Model starts analyzing these data and makes a real-time determination of their correlation with a user X  X  mood, stress, work productivity , interest in work and the seven emotions. Based on the determined relationships, the Advisory system automatically establishes a user X  X  mood, work productivity, stress, seven emotions and interest in work and then displays them in a digital form.

The main designation of the Module for Dependence Analysis is to search for interdependencies between the biometric and self-assessment parameters of various users and to accumulate these in the User X  X  Interdependence between Biometric and Self-Assess-ment Parameters Subsystem. It must be verified how the different parameters correlate with a user X  X  emotional state, work productivity, seven emotions and the e-Self-Assessment. The User X  X  Interdepen-dence between Biometric and Self-Assessment Parameters database accumulates a sufficient amount of historical biometric results, which canbeanalyzedbyauseratanytime.

The rest of the Model Base models are intended to formulate possible recommendation variants (how to improve a user X  X  work productivity and how to reduce st ress) and then to select the most rational variants for a specific user. One of the main innovative elements of the Advisory system on a global scale is specifically this.
The methods developed by the authors herein provide the bases for the development of these models as follows:  X  A method for the complex determination of criteria weights that takes into account their quantitative and qualitative characteristics ( Kaklauskas, 1999 )  X  this method allows calcu-lating and coordinating the weights of the quantitative and qualitative criteria according to the above characteristics.  X  A multiple criteria method for a complex and proportional evaluation of alternatives was developed (  X  Sliogerien _ e et al., 2009 ; Tupenaite et al., 2010 ) to enable a user to obtain a reduced criterion for determining the complex (overall) effi-ciency of an alternative.
 user with rational recommendations. It is also necessary to compile tables of interrelations, compatibilities and combinations and to produce a multi-variant design of the recommendation components to enable an automated multi-variant design of the recommendations. The Model-base Management System, which is based on Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables, may produce numerous alternative variants according to the suggested multi-variant design method. A determination is made on whether or not the generated suggestion variants meet applicable requirements. The variant that fails to comply with requirements is discarded.
Problems of compatibility between criteria weights occur during the multi-variant design of recommendations. In such cases, the weight of a specific criterion during the integrated assessment of an alternative depends on the entire set of assessed criteria along with their values and initial weights.
 evaluated by considering ethical, psychological, economic, esthetic, technical, technological, comfort, legal, social and other aspects, the
Advisory system model facilitates an integrated analysis of the alternative recommendations and the selection of the most rational of them. With the above models serving as the basis, the Advisory system automatically creates alternative variants of recommenda-tions, generates their multiple criteria analysis, determines their utility degree and selects the most efficient variants. various models on demand. When the Model-base Management
System is used, the results that some of the models calculate (initial criteria weight determination) become the initial data for other models (multi-variant design of recommendations and multiple criteria analysis of recommendations). These, in turn, produce results that are used as the starting point in still other models (determination of the utility degree of recommendations and submission of recommendations). 4. Case study: determining stress level and providing recommendations must constantly interact with clients, suppliers and the service staff on her job to demonstrate how the developed Advisory system operates.
 decreased in Lithuania when the global financial crisis hit. Under such unfavorable conditions, survival and ultimate success depend on the provision of high quality services to clients at affordable prices, especially since hotels are highly competitive. Furthermore assurance of high-quality client services is the most important task of each hotel. The accomplishing this under existing conditions is not easy, because many hotels had to terminate some of their personnel due to the decrease in overnight guests and to cut the salaries of the rest. All these circumstances have caused a great deal of tension among hotel employees.

Hotel employees generally lack opportunities for job advance-ment. These jobs often involve huge workloads at inhumane hours with limited time off on weekends ( Karatepe and Uludag, 2008 ). Additionally hotel employees are assigned to the emotional labor category, which demands a display of certain emotions while promoting organizational goals. This phenomenon exists in the sphere of most services and it is an essential and marketable component of an organization X  X  offerings ( Van Dijk et al., 2011 ). In this type of work, stressful situations and nervous exhaustion are unavoidable, and these cause a negative influence on the quality of the work performed.

Work-related factors, i.e., employment conditions, need for concentration at work and dissatisfaction with the work content and work environment, are not the only factors to impact the aforementioned hotel manager. Family-related factors, such as marital status, satisfactory family life, the economic situation, daily life, disagreements with the husband/or cohabitant and the like, affect her as well ( J  X  onsson et al., 2003 ).
No sooner does the hotel manager walk into her office at the beginning of a new workday, when a colleague walks in with a new employee ready to discuss issues of importance for the job.
The manager glances at her desk and sees a new pile of papers stacked on it. Just then the telephone rings. It is the hotel administrator announcing the arrival of an important guest from abroad who had stayed in the hotel X  X  apartments a couple months ago but, for some inexplicable reason, these apartments are currently occupied. No sooner does she hang up, when the phone rings again. This time she hears the strict and displeased voice of her superior telling her to come to his office immediately.
The manager is now nervous and somewhat confused. She asks her colleagues to wait and rushes out to see the boss. The talk with her superior is most unpleasant, pressured and accusatory. The manager, now worried about the unpleasant situation that has unfolded as well as the disrespectful behavior of her boss during their talk, has no idea how to handle all the piled up work. She suddenly feels tension, anger and helplessness wash over her.
She returns to her office. Without even looking at her colleagues, she asks them to return later. Her anxiety and anger do not lessen, and she realizes that she is unable to control herself, calm down and concentrate on her work and that she needs help in this situation.
Many a person has landed in a situation when work-related stress causes strong, negative experiences, which have a harmful influence on the employee X  X  physical and mental health. Then professional help becomes necessary. The Advisory system can provide appropriate service in such instances. The manager can use this system in the following stages:
Stage 1 . Determine the level of needs satisfaction and the significance of recommendations in Maslow X  X  pyramid of needs.
Stage 2 . Get ready to work with the Advisory system by launching it.

Stage 3 . Establish stress dependencies on biometric data and submit the stress level: Biometric and Self-Assessment Parameters Subsystem.

Stage 4 . Receive the best recommendations to manage the stressful situation.

Stage 1. The universal Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables, which are compiled during this stage, are adapted to a specific individual (see Section 3.6, Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables). If the system user X  X  outlook on the factors that cause and lessen his/her stress level does not change, then there is no need to repeat this stage in the future. If it does change, then the changes must be quantitatively named in Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables. First, the manager must evaluate 20 statements based on Maslow X  X  Hierarchy of Needs, which are grouped according to Maslow X  X  five basic needs, i.e., physiological, safety, social, esteem and self-actualization needs, starting from the lowest and going to the highest level needs. The submitted statement descriptions are evaluated by the percentage of needs satisfaction for each one. The evaluation scale ranges from 0 X 100 percent, where 0 percent indicates that a need is entirely satisfied and 100 percent  X  entirely unsatisfied.
Once these are evaluated, each submitted recommendation must be evaluated separately by importance on a scale ranging from 0 X 100 percent, where 0 percent means it is not important at all and 100 percent  X  very important. The system user also pays heed to the environment when evaluating the received recom-mendations by some certain percentage  X  is the system to be used at work or home, at the gym, shopping center or some other environment, because opportunities for implementing certain recommendations are limited in different areas. The recommen-dations are grouped by the level of stress being experienced, i.e., the level of slight stress ranges from 0 X 33 percent, average  X  from 34 X 66 percent and strong  X  from 64 X 100 percent. The user of the system evaluates the statements depending on the complexity of the personal situation, the location, and the consequent recom-mendations only once.

Thus, the aforementioned manager first evaluates the 20 submitted statements relevant to the level of needs satisfaction and then the importance of the recommendations (see Fig. 12 ).
Stage 2. Now the manager readies the system for work. She connects the Biometric Finger and biometric computer mouse into the USB port. If the system had been used previously, she merely checks that the connection is intact. Then she runs the Advisory system (see Fig. 2 ). Once the system is launched, the manager goes to Step 1 of Stage 3.

Stage 3. Establishing stress dependencies of the biometric data and changing the stress level:
Step 1 . The manager puts on the Biometric Finger (see Section 3.4, for a detailed description). Pulse readings are submitted immediately upon clicking the button labeled  X  X  X easure pulse X  X  (see Fig. 2 for an example of the manager X  X  measured pulse count by the window labeled  X  X  X our pulse X  X , where the upper window shows the pulse count from the biometric computer mouse and the lower window  X  from the Biometric Finger). The Biometric
Finger also aids the measurements of humidity, electrogalvanic skin conductance and skin temperature along with heart rate.
These data are stored in the User X  X  Biometric Database. Once the pulse count is read, Step 2 follows.

Step 2. Now the manager takes her systolic and diastolic blood pressures using the blood pressure gauge. She enters the blood pressure gauge readings into the appropriate user interface fields (see Fig. 2 ).

Step 3. Once she has completed the previous steps, the manager goes to the Self-assessment questionnaire (see Section 3.1). This can be filled out now or even at Step 1, prior to using the Biometric
Finger. She subjectively evaluates her emotional state, i.e., her personal mood, levels of the seven emotions (self-control, happi-ness, anger, fear, sadness, surprise and anxiety), productivity and stress in light of her current situation. Finally, she indicates her own temperament type. The statements are rated on a 10-point system (see Fig. 2 for examples).

Step 4. After the self-assessment questionnaire is filled out, the button labeled  X  X  X tart mouse tracking X  X  is clicked. This begins the biometric computer mouse measurements: the user X  X  hand humidity, skin conductance, intensity of touch and heart rate.
This device also assists in accumulating data such as the speed and acceleration of mouse pointer X  X  movement, amplitude of hand tremble, scroll wheel use, right-and left-click frequency and idle time. All such biometric data are stored in the User X  X 
Biometric Database analogically to those taken from the Bio-metric Finger to use in determining the dependencies between self-assessment and the biometric parameters (see Fig. 1 for several examples of dependencies) ( Fig. 13 ).

Step 5. Now that the appropriate data has been selected, the manager clicks on the indicator field found below the button labeled  X  X  X nd mouse tracking X  X  (see Fig. 2 ). This prompts the appearance of data diagrams on that day X  X  observations and the dependencies of the self-assessment on biometric parameters. If the Advisory system was used previously, it is possible to view the historical report on the correlation between the historical, biometric and self-assessment parameters by selecting the month and day for the desired comparison. Fig. 14 shows this manager X  X  historical report on the correlation between stress and biometric parameters, where this manager X  X  stress level, determined during the self-assessment, appears on the abscissa axis and the bio-metric parameters  X  on the ordinate axis.

Fig. 14 shows that, as the level of stress rises, there are also respective rises in the manager X  X  temperature and pulse count from the biometric computer mouse along with skin resistance as well as the systolic blood pressure. These dependencies correspond with data from analogical tests worldwide (see Section 2). The existing stress level is determined for each of the dependencies according to the biometric parameters taken at some certain moment, and their average significance is calculated. In the case of our manager, when her temperature  X  30 1 C, her pulse  X  78 times/min, her systolic blood pressure  X  125 mmHg and her diastolic blood pressure  X  77 mmHg, her average stress level was 52 percent.

Stage 4. Once the average stress level is determined by the dependency diagrams, here at 52 percent, the Model-base Manage-ment System and Model Base (see Section 3.7) selects fifteen of the most important stress reduction recommendations (see Fig. 15 ). The manager should repeat the steps of the first stage of the Advisory system during the daytime each 45 min, i.e., refresh her self-assessment and biometric parameters. However, whenever productivity, stress and/or emotions change, the work with the system can be terminated by clicking the button labeled  X  X  X nd mouse tracking X  X . The process can then be started anew.
Use of this developed system to establish the level of stress being experienced by an individual involves answering several questions during an actual timeframe. Then the system selects recommendations compiled according to Maslow X  X  Needs Pyra-mid, which can assist in lessening stress level and increasing work productivity. 5. Scenario used to test and validate the Advisory system and its composite parts The Department of Construction Economics and Property Management of Vilnius Gediminas Technical University intro-duced the following programs in e-learning for Master X  X  degree studies: Real Estate Management in 1999, Construction Econom-ics in 2000, Internet Technologies and Real Estate Business in 2003 and Intelligent Built Environment in 2009 (see http://odl. vgtu.lt/ ). There are currently 239 master students from all over Lithuania studying in these four e-learning master X  X  programs. Research showed that the distance learning staff and students want to be active participants in shaping strategic alternatives for their emotional states and work productivity.
 The initial version of the Web-based Biometric Computer Mouse Advisory System to Analyze a User X  X  Emotions and Work Productivity was invented in 2006. The testing of the Advisory system has been ongoing since that time. There were 33 employ-ees involved in testing the system and 206 distance-learning students and employees of Vilnius Gediminas Technical Univer-sity testing its composite parts. The preliminary results of the tests on the Advisory system were announced at the 25th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction in 2008 ( Kaklauskas et al., 2008 ; Zavadskas et al., 2008 ). The Advisory system was improved in light of the continuous testing results. Some 20 final mas ter theses were completed on the testing of the Advisory system. All of the 239 test subjects used computers on their jobs consta ntly. Women who wanted to apply such acquired experiences in their actual lives expressed a greater desire to take part in the experiment. They were interested, for example, in learning how to manage stress better. Men were less interested in such a social issue.

Similar studies conducted in other countries had fewer subjects in their experiments. For example, 40 students participated in the Krumhansl study (1997) , 100 psychology students in the McFarland study (1985) , 24 healthy, right-handed women in the Baumgartner et al. study (2006) and 32 women in the Rimm-Kaufman and Kagan study (1996) .

Other researchers also partially applied a scenario analogical to this one. Their studies are briefly described heretofore.
McFarland (1985) described how 100 introductory psychology students listened to music that caused changes in these students X  skin temperatures. The students listened to two selected pieces of music that they appraised themselves: one as arousing negative emotions and the other, as arousing calm, positive emotions. During that time, their body temperatures were being measured. (In the scenario herein, the respondents also appraised their own emotions.)
In the dynamic emotion rating experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to one of four emotional states. The ten subjects in the first state were instructed to adjust the position of the slider on the display continuously to indicate the degree of sadness they felt while listening to the music. The instructions to the ten subjects in each of the other three states were identical except that they involved fear, happiness and tension, respec-tively. All subjects had a short practice experiment to become familiar with the display and ask any questions they might have about their assigned task ( Krumhansl, 1997 ).

Subjects also filled out a short questionnaire about the emo-tional effects of the music after each piece. They were asked to rate how they felt while listening to the music using a rating scale from 0 to 8. These feelings were afraid, amused, angry, anxious, contemptuous, contented, disgusted, embarrassed, happy, inter-ested, relieved, sad and surprised. Additionally they were asked to rate, on the same scale, the pleasantness and intensity of the music and their familiarity with the music before the experiment. At the end of the experiment, they filled out a short questionnaire that included questions about their musical training ( Krumhansl, 1997 ).
In the physiological experiment, physiological sensors were attached to subjects seated in a comfortable chair. They were told they would hear several short musical excerpts while their physiological responses were being monitored. They filled out the same questionnaire after each piece about emotional effects and the same questionnaire at the end of the experiment about their musical training ( Krumhansl, 1997 ).

The duration of the Advisory system testing scenario by the authors herein lasted one month. It was conducted in three stages that included eleven steps as follows:
Stage 1 . A diagram of interdependency between a user X  X  biometric parameters and the data submitted during the self-assessment is determined (see Table 2 ).
 perspective of a specific user. Each experiment subject applied Maslow X  X  Pyramid Tables to his/her specific needs. Since these
Tables were compiled in reflection of Best Worldwide Practices, such a selection by an experiment subject is sufficiently objective.
Rather subjective suggestions can be approached by discussing merely a few alternative recommendations. However, when tens of thousands alternative recommendations are analyzed by mathematical methods, the objectivity level of the analysis is substantially raised, since solely multiple criteria analysis meth-ods are employed, and they are objective. 5.1. Statistical analysis of average temperature dependency on anxiety
Biometric mouse by solely considering the dependency of average temperature on anxiety. Temperature t was recorded m  X  393,732 times. In all these instances, the level of anxiety i respective to temperature was also recorded. A subject assessed the level of anxiety for his/herself by subjectively assigning a meaning on a scale of 1 X 10.
 t q ( l ) is the Student X  X  t -distribution quantum q under number of degrees of freedom l.

In general a confidence interval is an interval within which, it is probable, there is a measurable parameter of some size (e.g., an average). This is named the confidence interval or the confidence equation (usually 0.95 is sufficient). The confidence interval of average temperature t i under the confidence probability Q is
A  X  t i D i , t i  X  D i  X  t i
Table 3 shows the summary of the calculation results. It is obvious that the confidence intervals of average temperature are very narrow, and they do not intersect under differing signifi-cances of anxiety level i . This shows that the obtained average temperatures respective to different levels of anxiety may be used when summarizing conclusions and making decisions.

The significances of the dependency of average temperature on anxiety level i are presented in Fig. 16 . It can be seen that, as the anxiety level increases from 1 to 7, temperature decreases monotonically. However, following that, temperature begins ris-ing  X  great anxiety stipulates a rise in temperature. Additional research is needed to explain and justify this phenomenon. One more thing that requires attention is that the values of great anxiety are less probable  X  then the probability is over 12 times less than average.
 6. Calculating reliability of stress dependencies on diastolic and systolic blood pressures and finger temperature by analyzing the entire User X  X  Biometric Database
Variations in stress level ( Y ) relative to the analyzed variables (diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, finger tempera-ture), listed in Table 4 , were investigated using the regression method. These variables are obtained from the entire User X  X  Biometric Database. The linear regression models Y  X  a U X  X  b were constructed for each variable using over one million obser-vations. In this model, Y represents the stress level, whereas other notations are established in Table 4 which presents the raw regression coefficients with their significance parameters ( z -value and p -level) and the standardized regression coefficients ( Beta ). The magnitude of these last coefficients allows comparing the relative contribution of each independent variable in the predic-tion of the dependent variable (stress level Y ). Since a huge amount of data provide the base for the analysis, all the variables become statistically significant (as p -level approaches zero). Table 4 provides clear evidence that all the variables under analysis are important predictors of stress. 7. Conclusions The Web-based Biometric Compu ter Mouse Advisory System to Analyze a User X  X  Emotions and Work Productivity was developed in 2006 to increase the work efficiency of employees. Trials of the system ensued and continued for four years involving various employees working with computers in differing fields. During these trials, various possibilities sur faced for improving the system X  X  hardware and software, and the system was improved accordingly. This article describes the developed Recommended System and it hardware and software subsystems in detail. An algorithmic basis that these authors developed was employed for this system. Detailed references to these algorit hms are provided. The submitted Case Study reflects the real environment of the people who are working on real projects. Further, the article describes the scenario used to test and validate the Advisory system.

The plans for the next stage of the Advisory system X  X  devel-opment involves integrating this system with other intelligent voice and IRIS analysis systems, which have also been developed by the authors herein. Such an integration of intelligent and biometrics systems would provide even better assessments of the emotional states and work productivity of users and the submis-sions of specific recommendations to them.
