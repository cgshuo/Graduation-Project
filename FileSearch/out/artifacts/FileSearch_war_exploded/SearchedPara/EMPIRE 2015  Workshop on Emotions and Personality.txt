 The EMPIRE workshop focuses on recommender systems (and other personalized systems) that take advantage of user-centric properties, such as emotions and personality. The workshop is organized as a focused mini-conference with technical and position papers. The goal is to gather the scat-tered work under a common umbrella and take advantage of the discussion time to draw future research opportunities. H.1.2 [ MODELS AND PRINCIPLES ]: User/Machine Systems; H.3.4 [ INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL ]: Systems and Software  X  User profiles and alert services ; I.2.0 [ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ]: General; I.2.1 [ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ]: Ap-plications and Expert Systems Algorithms, Human Factors, Experimentation, Theory, De-sign Emotions, Personality, Recommender Systems The 3rd EMPIRE workshop is held in conjunction with the ACM RecSys 2015 conference in Vienna (Austria) on 19. September 2015. The previous editions of the workshop have been held in conjunction with UMAP 2013 in Rome and with UMAP 2014 in Aalborg.

The RecSys research community has done a tremendous job in the last decade on exploiting various data sources to improve recommendations of all kinds through sophisti-cated algorithms. The workshop complements these core RecSys activities by pushing the agenda of taking into ac-count user-centric aspects, such as emotions and personality, into the RecSys framework. In fact, personality and emo-tions shape our daily lives by having a strong influence on our preferences, decisions and behaviour in general. In re-cent years, emotions and personality have shown to play an important role in various aspects of recommender systems, such as implicit feedback, contextual information, affective content labeling, cold-start problem, diversity, cross-domain recommendations, group recommendations etc. With the development of robust techniques for the unobtrusive ac-quisition of emotions (e.g. from various modalities, such as video or physiological sensors) and personality (e.g. from social media) the time is right to take advantage of these possibilities to collect massive datasets and improve recom-mender systems.

The topics include the usage of affect and personality to improve personalized systems, as contextual factors, as im-plicit feedback, in cross domain recsys, for calculating user and item similarities, in applications, for supporting human decision making, in group recsys, for addressing the cold-start problem, the implicit detection of affect/personality for personalized systems, computational models of emotion and personality and evaluation methods.

The workshop has a hybrid format; it accepts either (i) technical papers (long: 12 pages max, short: 8 pages max) or (ii) white papers/position statements (6 pages max).
