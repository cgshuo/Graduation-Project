 Moderation within online communities is critical. Though many guidelines are available that describe the goals of successful moderation, these often minimize the complex interplay that exists between tools and practi ces of moderators. This study investigates the role of mode ration through the lens of the moderators in a nascent online community for adolescents. Based on an analysis of their activities, three classes of emergent behavior were uncovered when e xploring how the available tools impacted the way moderator wo rk was performed. The findings reveal a need for design considerations that take into account the appropriateness of match between the tools and work processes from a moderator perspective. H.5.3 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Group and Organization Interfaces  X  Computer-supported cooperative work Design, Human Factors, Management, Measurement Online Communities, Sociotechnical Systems, Adolescents, Awareness, Moderati on, Design, Tools Online communities fill an important space in society, serving as a place where increasing amounts of social interaction transpires. They are complex constructions where relations are mediated not just by the technical interfaces, but also by the policies and norms prescribed by the community. In nearly all guidelines for community design, the function of moderation is described as a principle means of social control [12, 21, 22]. Here, however, lies a hidden challenge. Though much at tention has been given to studying the effect of various mode ration strategies [5, 12, 14] on an online community and on incorporating this wisdom in design to arrive at more efficient tool s and moderation strategies, there has been little consideration of th e usefulness of these tools within the full spectrum of moderator tasks or how these tools shape the process and perception of moderation. This paper focuses on how available tools affect the character and practice of moderation. We expl ored this from a sociotechnical perspective by following the processes used by seventeen undergraduate students tasked with moderating an online community for adolescents. We observed how the moderators identified the temporal rhythms and social norms of the community, performed thoughtful surveillance, and balanced desires to participate with their tasks of moderation. Moderation in online communities is often considered to fit one of two extreme states  X  full moderati on or none. This need not be so binary. Rather there are many ways in which the moderation function can be accomplished. Roughly dissected, three principle forms dominate the landscape: administrator-controlled moderation, moderators as exp licit roles, and crowd-based moderation. Those who first create the meeting space for an online community often become its principle moderators. In this way, the task of moderation often intersects with the role of the system administrator who is tasked with both the technical maintenance of the online community as well as guiding the interaction the platform provides. These conditi ons often increase the rapidity and intensity of moderator inte rvention (e.g., banning members) [16]; a natural condition of admini stration by a small, dedicated group. However, as noted by Co sley [4], those communities that are managed by an elite few have a noticeable point of failure; t, if these individuals do not perform their tasks, stagnation or failure of a community may follow. A second form of moderation is that of the moderator as an explicit role in the community. The moderator is typically an expert in the community with longstanding experience and the ability to direct members to existing resources, appropriate discussions, and arranges the envi ronment to suit the needs of conversations. This last activity wa s illustrated by the role of the  X  X izards, X  or moderators, in the Pueblo online community [20]. In this community, wizards were gi ven far-reaching permissions to support the goals of the community to facilitate knowledge transfer between secondary school children. In later stages of the Pueblo community the wizards were promoted from the general membership of the community. This aligns to Kim X  X  [12] suggestion that certain tasks of moderation can be assumed by members as they progress through di fferent roles from visitors to elders. A growing body of work has examined how moderation is accomplished by the community as a whole. In this third form of moderation, all members are encouraged to take part in community maintenance activities. Distributing this function has proven critical to the success of larger communities, including familiar examples such as Slashdot [14] and Wikipedia [1]. Such exploration has also led to research streams centered on understanding, coordinating, and improving this process. While each of these forms has its own merits and constraints, the central goal of each is to enable the general practice of moderation. The essence of an online community is social interaction; it is through this discourse that member needs are met and the purpose of the community is advanced. Moderation facilitates the interaction in a community by: A vital component of sociotechni cal community design relates to ensuring member discourse. To achieve this goal moderators promote ongoing participation fr om active members, and entice both newcomers and less comm unicative participants to contribute more fully to the online community. All communities must sustain an appropriate level of discourse to maintain a vibrant and sustainable community. A delicate balance must be achieved between too few and too many community members; too few members can lead to insufficient discussions needed to maintain interest, while an overabundance of members can make the community feel impersonal and can overwhelm moderators, who must expend significant time ensuring appropriate activity [22]. Moreover, as sociological theory suggests, the larger the communi ty, the less indi vidual members will feel the need to personally contribute [10]. Markus [17] described the ideal quantity of di scourse in terms of critical mass, where the benefits of community membership are in tandem with the effort required to participate. To achieve sufficient member discourse, online communities leverage a variety of best practi ces that have emerged from extant research, including techniques that are technically focused and those that are allied with social practices. In terms of technical approaches, incentive strategies have proven useful at softening the perceived tradeoff between participation that is beneficial to the community and the reward that members expect in return. For instance, as an incentive to rank movies in the MovieLens database, me mbers were provided with personalized recommendations afte r rating fifteen movies [11]. Similarly, facilitation techniques are also effective within online communities. Linguistic prompts, as an example, help to facilitate free-form communication in message boards and chats. Using this technique authors are provided with message formats that conform to norms of the community, thereby reducing cognitive overhead and stimulating replies from peers. For example, group introductions such as  X  X  X  X e been lurking for a few months X  have been shown to double the number of replies to posted messages [2]. Incentive strategies such as increased personalization and facilitation techniques such as linguistic prompts are novel methods that designers leverage to promote discourse, but are a relatively new practice in online community design. Conversely, a more tested approach is to use m oderators to achieve similar ends. These specialized members are able to leverage a combination of their intimate knowledge of the co mmunity with social strategies moderators to provide openings fo r individuals to contribute to discussions, including posting open-ended questions, constructive development of new avenues of discussion, and forming topic-driven subgroups where members with specific interests may congregate. Once discourse commences, the community must ensure that it remains targeted to the purpose for which it was created. Studies indicate that consistent focus is critical to long term sustainability [3, 23]. Here too, moderators are the primary gatekeepers; recent evidence suggests that moderated online communities are more appealing to users than those w ith no formal moderation [25]. The appeal of moderated communities is likely the result of discourse that is kept on topic, and is therefore more apt to conform to norms of community interaction. Discourse occurring outside of the accepted norms disr upts the flow of the community and diverts it from its stated purpos es. Best practice suggests that outside of introductory tutorials [13], moderators are the best means to help inform newcomers of community ground rules, provide guidance on their use, enforce policies, and resolve disputes [22]. In all discourse, whether face-to-face or through computer-mediated channels, potential exis ts for conversation to become hostile, disruptive, and toxic to the community. By shielding personal identity through the anonymity that online environments afford, social barriers are erased, increasing negative behavior that is not as prevalent within iden tifiable settings. In her book on online communities, Preece commented,  X  X n fact, not having to face people, and knowing that you may never encounter them again online seems to encourage participants to vent negative feelings, often for no apparent reason [22]. X  For others, disruptive behavior stems from misinterpreting the meaning of a particular message. Such misinterpretation is more likely in an online setting where interchanges are conducted devoid of nonverbal cues. To reduce inappropriate behavior, best practice suggests using m oderators to reconstruct social barriers and enforce community norms to temper disruptive discourse. This task is challenging and requir es interpretation that technical solutions are unable to fully provide. Moderators must consider message context and member attr ibutes such as length of membership to determine appr opriate responses. Designed to assist moderators in rendering th eir response, a variety of tools have been developed to assist in: Perhaps the best strategy though, is to adopt a moderation style that proactively discourages negative activities. To achieve these ends, it is suggested that moderators promote civil behavior  X  that is, to encourage people to want to  X  X it in X  [12]. While moderation is an evolving c oncept, it is crucial to the design of online communities. As one facet of a larger research agenda exploring online community design, we focused on the work processes of moderation within the nascent community, Fieldtrip. Fieldtrip is an online community created as a place where adolescents can congregate to enga ge their peers in a formative dialogue exploring factors that they believe impact their learning and education. This focus was developed based on evidence that adolescents who are emotionally engaged in the learning process [6] or possess a feeling of ownership of their education [9] show higher levels of achievement. Gi ven the increasingly prominent communication [15], Fieldtrip was designed to rely heavily on online video as a catalyst for these interactions. Seventy-eight adolescents aged 12 X 20 years (mean=16.40, SD=1.66) enrolled in grades 6 X 12 participated in a month long pilot of the community during the Spring of 2007. Most were in their last two years of high school . Half were female and half were male. They represented similar diversity to the Mid-Atlantic US region where the community recruitment took place (48% percent identified themselves as European American, 16% African American, 1% Hispanic, 3% Asian, and 31% other). Recruitment for the community occurred in two phases. The first utilized a variety of recruitment methods to invite teens to join a community discussing educational issues of interest to them. These methods included broadcast invitations (e.g., sending mass emails, handing out flyers, crea ting groups and posting messages to social networking websites), prompting by authority figures (e.g., parents and teachers), and i nvitations directly from peers [8]. All methods directed potential me mbers to the Fieldtrip website for further details, which included contact information and eligibility requirements. These requirements were: access to broadband Internet, enrolled in middle or high school, parent permission, adolescent assent, and the agreement to abide by certain rules, such as no taboo content and no personal identifying information. The second recruitment phase ta rgeted high schools within the local metropolitan vicinity with the intent of recruiting a cadre of older adolescents (age 16-18) to serve as filmmakers for the community. A goal of approxima tely six filmmakers was considered a number sufficient to balance the risk of drop out (particularly given the high student-turnover rates in the school system) with the availability of equipment and resources. Interested filmmakers were asked to submit a sample video and paragraph indicating how they fe lt adults or school had (or had not) prepared them for adulthood. Following a review of these materials, seven adolescents were selected to participate. All accepted the invitation. Each of the adolescent filmmakers received special training and was assisted by media professionals in creating provocative, short documentary videos for the online community. The filmmakers were each asked to c hoose a line of inquiry for their videos  X  something they felt strongly impact ed their engagement in school and learning (e.g.,  X  X re relationships with teachers as important as those with parents? Are they similar? X ,  X  X ho controls your education? X ,  X  X ow is school part of larger issues of social injustice? X ) While the media professionals assisted them in this task, care was taken to not treat the filmmakers as subjects, but rather as  X  X urrogates X  for the issu es salient to their line of inquiry. Video clips were created usin g video cell phones donated by mobile phone manufacturer NOKIA. These videos were uploaded and presented in a password protected website that hosted the community (see figure 1). Each video was displayed in its own threaded message board in which text comments could be ente red as posts. Seven of these message boards were available at the launch of the community, each corresponding to a filmmaker X  X  introductory video. New videos were created during the course of the pilot at a rate of two to three per day, culminating in a total of 76 videos. Each video was associated with a new me ssage board (as in figure 2). Additional topical message boards, not tied to a particular video, were also featured; all users were able to create them. Forty-two text-only message boa rds were created in addition to those associated with videos, yielding a total of 118 unique message boards. Full size images of all screen shots, along with sample videos from the online community, are available on the Fieldtrip blog at http://www.umbc .edu/fieldtrip. To balance the tradeoff between preserving participant anonymity and allowing them to express themselves as individuals, the adolescents were required to create a permanent screen name upon enrollment in the community (with the exception of the seven filmmakers that used thei r first names as screen names). This was accomplished by having the adolescents select two to three words from a random list of 150 words, similar in process to the popular use of  X  X agnetic poetry. X  Joining the adolescents in the Fi eldtrip community were seventeen moderators recruited from the undergraduate students of the Psychology Department at the host institution. Though none of the undergraduates had prior experience in online community moderation, they all had progr essed into higher education upon graduating from high school. Their expertise then, was based in their own recent secondary school experience, making them, ostensibly, an ideal fit for the th eme of discussions anticipated in the community. To mitigate their lack of moderation experience, each undergraduate attended several training sessions that covered general strategies of moderati on, escalation procedures for potential emergency situations (including reporting abuse and suicide indicators), and record ing of field notes. During these training sessions moderators expl ored the online community and became acquainted with its operation. While unpaid, these moderators did receive independent study credit as compensation for participating in meetings and attending their shifts. Moderators created and posted s hort profiles about themselves and, like the adolescent participants, chose screen names that preserved anonymity yet allowed creative expression of personal identity. To visibly denote the moderator postings from those of other members of the community, the prefix  X  X OD X  was appended to their selected screen names. In addition to having full access to the features of the online community that the adolescent members had, the moderators were also able to use additional backoffice features available within a restricted administrative site. In th is website moderators were able to edit or delete posts, receive additional information necessary to contact community memb ers individually through email, track the activity of individual members, access a suicide prevention guide, and view general statis tics on site usage. The administrative site also provided a backchannel discussion forum available to the moderators that they could use to talk about moderating, share strategies, and handle coordinati on activities not applicable (or appropriate) for the main online community. The primary method used by m oderators to carry out their responsibilities was through posting in the community X  X  message boards. After the first week that the site was online, the moderators were also asked to use a Fieldtrip-specific email address to contact teen comm unity members who had not yet visited the community to encourage them to do so. Other responsibilities included maintaining topical focus, keeping discourse ongoing and civil, and re solving technical difficulties encountered by the community participants. Each moderator worked a two-hour shift per day so that at least one moderator was actively monitoring the community during each hour of its operation (6:00am to 2:00am daily). Though we received informed consent from each adolescent X  X  parent or guardian and informed assent from each adolescent participant, around-the-clock moderation remained a requirement of our university X  X  institutional protocols regarding human subjects research on an a dolescent population. From a pragmatic perspective, th e moderators met the overarching goal of their assignment. During the course of the project there were no indications of dangerous behavior, regular conversations were both encouraged and on-topi c with minimal occurrences of negative discourse. When negative discourse occurred moderators easily corrected it. The goal of Fieldtrip was not to be an insipid location, ruled by iron-fisted moderators. Instead, it was created with the underlying desire to give adolescents a communal space to express their concerns on education and learning. For Fieldtrip to be a viable channel for adolescent social intera ction it had to be perceived as credible and authentic. The project administrators believed that this would be critical to the co mmunity X  X  success. Thus, in as much as too little moderation was deemed too risky, it was thought that too much moderation might stifle the community. This desire for a middle-of-the-road approach to moderation proved to be a reasonable objective. In a study of the impact of different moderation strategies among a variety of subgroups within the Junior Summit adoles cent online community, published shortly after the conclusion of Fiel dtrip, Cramer et al. [5] found that,  X  X igher adult moderation can be successful at task solution or lesson completion, but it also creates situations reminiscent of the old-fashioned classroom with the highly-involved students sitting at the front of the room. Medium moderation, on the other hand, creates a more distributed and collaborative environment, but it may result in decentraliza tion, shorter exchanges, and less attention to task. X  Despite these potential hurdles, there was strong interest in the premise of Fieldtrip. At its c onclusion, the online community had collected upwards of 450 posts strewn across over a hundred discussion boards. Investigation into the nature and content of these posts indicated a conversat ion that was overwhelmingly on-topic and, in many cases, deeply introspective. An analysis of activity patterns revealed that the majority of members were repeat visitors who watched mult iple videos and visited numerous discussion boards. These behavi ors illustrated a level of engagement with the community; a finding that was confirmed by the positive responses the adolescents gave to a post-pilot survey that inquired about their im pressions of the project. Results on the character and prac tice of moderation were obtained from the triangulation of multiple data sources. First, the Fieldtrip site itself was heavily instrumented. Using a custom monitoring engine incorporated into the technical infrastructure of the Fieldtrip online community, the authors recorded document and video access, length of time spent on each web page and video, and all typed content. Each moderator was also required to enter field notes within the moderator-only portion of the webs ite at the conclusion of their shift. These field notes recorded observations of the online community that transpired during their shift. Particular attention was given to the activities observed or conducted by the moderator. Since modera tors were permitted to read each other X  X  field notes, this occasionally led to comments on each other X  X  observations and impressions. Duri ng the pilot, nearly 430 field notes were recorded in addition to 168 posts within the moderator-only message board. All were capt ured and qualitatively analyzed. We inductively explored each of the textual data sources, borrowing methods from grounded theory [24], to investigate how moderators performed their role. Emergent themes were validated against recorded site activity. In this research we were interested in understanding moderation from a sociotechnical perspective. We were particularly interested in the interplay between how tools impacted the practice of moderation within Fieldtrip, a nd how the evolving practice of moderation impacted tool design and use. The results of our analysis provide unique insight into one cycle of their co-evolution. In the following sections we desc ribe how the suite of tools that was developed to aid moderators in their tasks fostered unique behaviors and enabled changed work practices. In each case, this is matched by exploring how these new behaviors in turn drove the reconceptualization of, and, in some cases, the redesign of the moderator tools. The suite of moderator tools was principally located in the administration website. (The only tool in the main online community website was a unique re d number next to each post that was visible only to moderators -a feature developed to allow the easy identification of a specific post). The suite included a utility to create and read field notes, a moderator-only discussion forum, tools to edit and delete posts, suicide prevention information, an email utility, and a tool to track the activity of the adolescent users of the site. This last tool was designed to provide moderators a means to focus their attention on site activity at the individual member level, as di splayed in figure 3. This functionality was originally desi gned to enable moderators to quickly respond to a disruptive post member by locating all locations where the member had pr eviously posted. The tool was also intended to furnish a broader context of a member X  X  activity, to evaluate the severity of a que stionable post (e.g., related to a potentially injurious activity) and to allow the moderator to quickly identify those others who might have seen it. As it turned out, the activity-tracking tool re ceived a much greater scope of use as discussed in the following sections. The initial Fieldtrip online community was created to enable a relatively small population of a dolescents to discuss issues surrounding education and learning via an intense multimedia web space. Though general patterns of member activity have been reported for large online social spaces [7], given the unique conditions of this community it wa s unclear how extensively prior research findings would transfer to this online community. We therefore needed to explore patterns of interactivity anew. The moderators thus entered into their roles with a significant sense of confusion surrounding the norms of the community X  X  use. The moderators noted their confusion through their field notes. For example: An activity tracking tool designed to reveal participants actions within the community, including message posts, video feed views and navigation throughout the site was provided to moderators. Using the tool, displayed in fi gure 3, moderators honed in on rhythms of community use, noting patterns and broadcasting them to fellow moderators within field notes and moderator-only message boards, occasi onally forwarding their own theories to explain activi ty levels: Over the course of their first few shifts, the moderators quickly developed a collective sense of the general patterns of usage, noting forms of explicit activity by the adolescent users,  X 3 users on from 6p-8p and there were a few posts from each X  (ModSportFreak), and involvement that would not be visible without the activity tracking t ool,  X  X ust some surf action. X  (ModLightningPrincess) By the second week of the communi ty X  X  operation, the moderators had begun to develop a consensus as to the amount of activity regarding the  X  X ypical X  shift (1-2 posts, a few adolescent lurkers with slightly higher activity mi d-morning ~10:00am, in the early evening ~4:00pm, and later in th e night ~8-10:00pm) and referred to their shifts in terms of this baseline,  X  X nly a few posts during this time...quiet as usual X  (M odButterflyPrincess),  X  X ust the typical shift, a few posts, some surfing. X  (ModMadPicklePrincess) Insofar as the affordances of the moderator tools enabled certain behaviors from the moderators, th ey used knowledge they gained to navigate perceived constr aints in the community. Once calibrated to the temporal norms of the community, a few of the moderators asked for different sh ifts in an effort to align themselves with active periods. While some of the moderators as ked to move to different, more active shifts, others attempted to repurpose the available tools to increase activity within their assigned time slot. This emergent behavior reflected a shift in t ool use and moderator activity from reactive to proactive. (Recall that the initial intent of the activity-tracking tool had been to provide support for investigation, repair and cleanup of problematic posti ngs after the fact. Forensics became fortunetelling.) In particular, moderators quickly realized the power that the activity-tracking tool afforded them over community members. Although a useful means to navigate to user posts, the moderators in Fieldtrip co-opted the initial design of the activity-tracking tool to meet new needs. In partic ular, moderators wanted to know how many community members were on-line during their assigned shift. During the course of our analysis of moderator activity we found that activity-tracking was repurpose d to meet this growing desire, elevating its significance and frequency of use to a degree that was initially unexpected. An unintended feature of the activity-tracking tool was its ability to sort events by date and time of participant activity. It became common practice for moderators to sort the display in this manner, continually refreshing th e list to expose recent events, including page navigation. This ha d a dual effect. Firstly, it provided a degree of insight into the number of online members. Secondly, when community members submitted new posts, moderators immediately navi gated to the post through the activity-tracking tool to examine the content. This often occurred in a separate window so that the moderator could continue to monitor the activity-tracking screen. Many of the moderators were very passionate about their job; they wanted the community to succeed and they sought to encourage discussion among the adolesce nts without being too heavy handed. To this end, they often expressed distress because they were unable to engage the members, whether lurkers or active members, in discussion. The degree of distress resulted in the second evolution of activity-tracking use. During periods of lo w posting, the moderators used the activity-tracking tool to distinguish between active participants and those that were merely lurking [18, 19]. Some moderators discovered (and subse quently disseminated to their peers) that they were able to engage community members in meaningful dialog by craftily using the activity-tracking tool to predict where a participant would be in the site and then, using their knowledge of the participants past activity, create a tailored post in an effort to induce more visible participation. One moderator in her field note explained this process: This technique was quite popular. Moderators posted a total of 241 times within the public discu ssion boards, 188 of which were responses to a teen X  X  post. In 72 of these instances (38%), prior to making their post, the moderators used the activity-tracking tool to explore the past activity of th e participant they were responding to. Sixteen of the seventeen moderators participated in this insightful surveillance technique over the course of the pilot study. This had the potential to be detrime ntal to the online environment. For example, if moderators had alluded to this new monitoring strategy within their posts it may have had the undesired effect of destroying the perception of anonymity. Instead, though, this behavior was used a ppropriately to inci te discussion while maintaining the integrity of the environment. In a sociotechnical system, users will adapt available toolsets to meet newfound needs when they are able to do so, just as they did with the activity-tracking utility. When designers are made aware of these needs, whether through observation and data collection or from participant requests, specific tools may be designed to better meet the needs of the community members. In our case, we received many requests asking for system features to facilitate and extend their practices of proactive engagement. As said by  X  X odBlue X , One of the reasons the moderators asked for more proactive tools was because they were much more engaged in the material and operation of the community than was anticipated. Insight into this phenomenon came when some modera tors revealed they had not been good students themselves in High School. For example,  X  X odIceMan X  posted a response to the topic: Why did you join? by saying, Other moderators reflected si milar desires of wanting to participate in the discussions, but choosing to remain on the outskirts due to their role: Yet, while the issues resonated w ith the collegiate moderators and they often perceived themselves as participants in the community, the moderators were aware that they had been assigned a special role and mission that made them separate and distinct from the role of adolescent participants. In addition, the activity tracking tool did an all too effective job of highlighting the downtimes in pa rticipation. This heightened visibility was often de moralizing to moderators. The tools at their disposal reinforced this difference, providing an awareness of the community that let them feel how profoundly empty it was at times: This difference was further reinforced by community administrators who became concerned that early overactive commenting by moderators might suppress adolescent participation or worse, compel these members to leave. The administrators intervened, cautiously asking moderators to  X  X ake a back seat. X  This concern spille d over into moderator discussions where they debated the proper role that they should take and negotiated the amount of activit y that would be reasonable: As illustrated in this last quote, the moderators did not get to become part of the community proper, they repurposed tools within the moderator site to create a sub-community for themselves. They established threads in the message boards to share stories on topical material that was being discussed within the community that they were overseeing. The field notes became a reflective journaling space where they commented not only on the activity levels in the communit y and the actions that they took, but also on their feelings about th e material and its relevance to their own educational outlook. Moderators play critical roles in many online communities, especially ones with vulnerable populations, like adolescents, or dealing with sensitive topics , such as healthcare. The computational support for moderator activities is often either non-existent or present at too crude a granularity (e.g., either system admin or user, with no position in between) to be useful. Thus a successful moderator becomes a br icoluer, creatively repurposing whatever resources and tools they have available to accomplish their task of supporting healthy community interaction. Viewing online communities as sociotechnical systems, the dynamic interplay between tools and actors leads to a co-evolution of the moderator role and tasks. In this paper, we explored on e particular co-evolution of a moderator support system. The suite of tools supporting moderation in Fieldtrip both promoted desired behavior, such as understanding the temporal rhythms of the community, unexpectedly constrained user experiences such as a alienation felt by the moderators, and enable d unforeseen evolution of tools to meet desired tasks, such as the thoughtful surveillance that allowed moderators to discover i ndividual user X  X  trajectories and predict their future behavior to stay a step ahead of them in the conversation. The Fieldtrip project supported an online community with a unique configuration of users, soci al structures, and support tools. Thus, the findings highlighted in this case are specific to the Fieldtrip community; expansion of results to the management and design of other online communities should be taken with caution. However, this unpacking of the impact of tool design on the character and practice of moderation reveals patterns of adaptation and modification that can inform the study and construction of other sites. Moderation is a nuanced behavior th at is all too easy to get wrong. It is often exacerbated by either a lack of computational support or heavy-handed tools (e.g., banish user), ill suited to the task at hand. We hope that this paper has helped raise awareness of the importance of moderation and the complex interplay between tool, task, and actor that results. This research explored moderati on as a component to the design of the pilot run of the Fieldtrip online community. As a sociotechnical practice, it was affected by the specifics of the community participants, the goals of the community, and the tools that the moderators had available to them. Our study of moderators is ongoing and will be continued in new iterations of Fieldtrip as we continue to exa mine how moderators perform their role in other online communities. The findings of this study yield insight into the nuanced work practices of those performing moderation. From a better understanding comes not only a greater insight into the challenges that confront moderators, but also the opportunity to inform the use, recommendation, and creation of the tools targeted to supporting moderator work processe s. The findings further reveal a need for continued research th at emphasizes understanding the appropriateness of match between tools and work processes from the perspective of moderators.
