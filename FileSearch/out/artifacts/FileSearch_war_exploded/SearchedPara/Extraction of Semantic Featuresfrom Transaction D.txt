 Dialogue systems may be designed to be closed-or open-domain. While a closed-domain dialogue system is limited to particular field (i.e., theater, credit cards, medicine), an open-domain dialogue system is portable to cross fields with en-tirely different domain ontologies. At its lowest level, an open-domain dialogue system should behave like a question and answering (QA) system, whereby the system attempts to answer queries in natural language in an assortment of ques-tion types such as how, why, what [1]. However, most of the QA systems answer to queries in isolation. This is an obvious limitation because the system knowl-edge in determining whether a query is relevant to the previous interaction con-text is very important.

In many QA systems such as in [2,3,4,5,6,7], the answers to queries are usually ranked based on the standard precision and recall measurement. The rudimen-tary approach to such ranking ability lies in the way the utterances are inter-preted in the first place, which is through terms extraction. This paper advocates for topical contributions in place of terms extraction to enhance the semantic understanding. This means, although utterances in a sequence of queries and answers may have the same topic as the common factor, the best answer will be based on how the topic relates to the context. For example, in a theater reser-vation system, the title of performance that serves as the topic may fall under different context; depending on whether it is extracted during the information-seeking or reservation activity.

To recognize the change of context in a series of question and answer exchange whether in a QA or dialogue systems, this research relies on focus of attention [8] to constrain the information that needs to be considered when judging the current context in relation to the previo us interaction context. Because the con-text can be maintained through topics in utterances, focus of attention will bind the response to the current query that the system has to attend to. Nonethe-less, system responses of similar topic may still not be answering to the same query, even when bounded with focus from the user utterance. The second level of discrimination warrant for the worth of knowledge itself that is encoded in each utterance. According to Maxim of Quantity (informativeness), a response must be as informative as is required with respect to current plan or goal [9]. This definition establishes constraints on magnitude of knowledge as whole, in addition to the contextual information.

Using a unified representation of semantic in utterances, the output of a nat-ural language understanding (NLU) component is useful to both dialogue and question-answering systems. Natural language output consists of two elements, which are the communicative function (intention/speech acts) and the proposi-tional content (semantics/topic and focus). They are commonly referred to input frame and are represented in the form of attribute-value pairs. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of input frame u of user input utterance U .

Extraction of semantic features in a query utterance depends on the struc-ture of the utterances and how the information is packaged within the utterance according to the Information Structure Theory [10]. From the figure, this paper covers only formalization of the propositional contents in an utterance while the formalization of the communicative functions is beyond the scope of this paper. The remainder of this paper proceeds as f ollows. Section 2 pr esents the Infor-mation Structure Theory as the basis of semantic extraction in this work. Sec-tion 3 presents the extraction process as well as the dialogue corpus, SCHIMA. Section 4 provides discussion before Section 5 concludes the research with some indications of the future works. Information structure refers to partitioning of utterance structure into semantic properties that could relate the utteranc e to discourse context. The semantics of utterances are modeled using two central notions in packaging the information structure, which are Topic and Focus from the theory of Information Structure [10]. According to this theory, topic is essentially what an utterance is about; it contains known information based on context of conversation. Focus, on the other hand, is new information that requires special attention. For example, in an utterance  X  X hen are the shows of King Lear? X ; the topic is the date of performance as indicated by the keyword  X  X hen X , and the focus is the title as indicated by keyword  X  X ing Lear X .

In the literature, there are a number of overlapping distinctions of the term topic-focus, for instance given-new, background-focus, topic-comment, or theme-rheme. The concept of topic (theme, given) and focus (comment, theme) devel-oped in this research follows relational view to topic and focus articulation in the sense that they are two complementary parts in a linguistic representa-tion. Topic is given in relation to focus, and focus is new in relation to topic. Hence, distinguishing between topic and focus is performed through analysis of informational-structural pair in an utterance through linguistic structure or grammar. The correlations b etween topic-focus and discourse given-new are com-plicated, but Rats [11] provided a good discussion of the various dichotomies.
In linguistics, the study of topic and focus of sentences falls under the area topic-focus articulation (TFA). The linguistic structure approach to TFA is based on the intuition that topic is the subject and focus is the predicate. When assess-ment is syntactic, arrangement of topics are contextually bounded to the main verb, while the rest of utterance (predicates) constitutes the focus. Therefore, the identification of topic and focus in a n utterance is exhaustive, whereby ev-ery element in the utterance belongs to ei ther topic or focus. In this research, the analysis of TFA reduced topic as a class while focus as the elements in the class. Topic-focus articulation is imperative in providing the theoretical basis for semantic feature extractions in Section 3. 2.1 Information Structure Because Information Structure Theory [10] adopted topic articulation as the first element in the sentence, topics are accessed depending on the mood of utterances such as assertives, imperatives, and interrogatives. Depending on the mood of utterances, the subject and verb a lso occupy different positions within the structure of utterance. Before going into details of the mood of utterances, a subject in a sentence refers to noun-phrase (NP), or phrases like gerund phrase, and subjects can be implied and omitted. A predicate in an a sentence refers to a finite verb phrase (VP), which consists of a finite verb with zero or more objects, complements, or adverbials. Table 1 shows the syntactic location of subjects depending on sentence moods.

Grosz [12] proposed the use of focus of attention in tracking the entities as the discourse progresses. She defined two level of focus; (1) global focus, which is entity relevant to entire discourse, and (2) immediate focus, which is entity central to a particular utterance. Wh ile topic gets anchored to the common about, focus delivers the very information that the utterance is structured to convey. 2.2 Information Packaging However, different utterance moods present different ways of information packag-ing. For example, left-dislocation or topicalization changes the structure, hence the object of the utterance. The purpose of topicalization is to highlight a piece of information that is important to a particular context. Consequently, this will lead to different topic and focus altogether. While information structure does not primarily affect the truth conditions of u tterances, it does affect the packaging hence the emphasis of the utterances. Consider the following utterances that are realized in different packaging of the same information: 1. You can go to  X  X cherzo X  played by Mini and Maxi in the period 9 March 2. In the period 9 March 1994 until 10 March 1994, you can go to  X  X cherzo X  Both utterances are assertion to state the date of a particular performance. However, after utterance (1) has been left-dislocated, the utterance structure changes into utterance (2). Although both utterances carry the same semantic meaning, focus and emphasis of the utterance has been changed from the title  X  X cherzo X  as in utterance (1), to date  X 9 March 1994 X  in utterance (2). Con-sequently, the weight for information presented in both utterances is different in responding to an input utterance in a specific context. Similarly, such effects can also be observed in cleft vs. pseudo-cleft utterance and active vs. passive utterance. 2.3 Measuring Informativeness Two important maxims related to measu ring or assessing informativeness in utterances are the Maxim of Quantity and the Maxim of Relevance [9]. The first maxim states that contribution must be as informative as is required with respect to current plan or goal during the pair of utterance exchange, while the second maxim states that do not make contribution more informative than required. The central idea in preserving the previous interaction context in a QA system is to produce response or query answers that adheres to the maxim of quantity and relevance, by being informative with respect to the topic in hand. To illustrate the predicament in measuring the informativeness, consider the utterances as shown in Fig. 2. Although these utterances share the same topic, which is date of performance, there are different means to measure the value of informativeness in each utterance.
From the figure, all utterances in general contains domain knowledge in the form of domain attributes. For example, in utterance (1),  X  X andide X  is a title of performance and  X  X oltaire X  is a name of artist. One possible way to measuring informativeness is through frequency counts of domain attributes in each utter-ance. By count of frequencies, one uttera nce may deemed to be more informative to another. Nonetheless, frequency counts are not enough to distinguish between two different utterances. On the surfa ce, utterance (6) and utterance (10) are similar in terms of content. However, if the informativeness score is solely based on the frequency of domain attributes, utterance (6) may carry more informa-tion as compared to utterance (10) because utterance (6) has one count for each domain attribute such as title , artist , date , seat ,and time , while utterance (10) has similar counts for only three domain attributes.

Alas, informativeness based on frequency counts is just the face value of the utterances. Due to the insufficient representation of informativeness score as provided by the domain attributes, there is a need for a more suitable way to measure informativeness. This paper argues that the differential score lies in the contextual knowledge that an utterance carries, which is the value of the focus in utterance. As shown in Fig. 1, the propositional content in the input frame consists of topic and focus. While topic bears semantics for the utterance, focus is best used to measure the information within the utterances.

To illustrate the significant role of focus, utterances in (6) and (10) and com-pared. Even though both utterances are s emantically equivalent on the surface, only one response utterance completely satisfy the need in the input utterance. Since the topic in utterance (6) is title while the topic in utterance (10) is date , utterance (10) is the best respond to the input query if and only if the focus of input utterance matches the topic, which is date . Similarly, focus of user utter-ances is important in measuring utterances that do not have domain attributes, for instance, response utterance (4), (7), and (9) because their frequency counts of domain attributes are zeroes. This shows that focus in utterances can be used to answer a query whether in a QA or dialogue system according to context, rather than answering in isolation. According to Carberry [13], relevance issues are related to the topic of the con-versation. In a dialogue system, an utterance is considered relevant only when it is aligned with the goals or sub-goals within the context of conversation. Simi-larly in a QA system, an answer can be related back to the previous interaction context by using topic and focus in an utte rance. Basically, context is the global topic in a series of utterance exchange and topic is localized to a particular utter-ance with its corresponding focus of attention. Given the topic in an utterance, context can be derived from the abstract ion of topic by keeping track the cur-rent value for topic. This is because at most of the time, dialogue between both user and system do not explicitly stat e whether they are moving from one con-text to another, for example from information-seeking to making reservation. To illustrate the extraction process for semantic features encoded in dialogue utterances, a transaction dialogue corpus for theater reservation system called SCHISMA is used. 3.1 SCHISMA Dialogue Corpus SCHISMA is a theater information and booking system developed by the Uni-versity of Twente [14]. It is chosen to demonstrate the semantic feature extrac-tion process because the theater domain i ncorporates a variety of wide-ranging knowledge like title of performance, date and time of shows, names of artists , authors , composers ,and directors . Because SCHISMA supports both informa-tion and reservation, it is a transaction dialogue where two dialogue participants negotiate to achieve a common goal [15]. In order to assist users to make reser-vation, SCHIMA demands the user to specify a unique title, an exact number of ticket, and additional information like the discount cards or preferred seats so the system could propose the ticket price accordingly. Although the interaction requires mutual commitment to achieve th e discourse objective, which is theater reservation, the user is also free to a ccept, reject or abandon any of his prior decisions. A dialogue excerpt from a theater information and booking system called SCHISMA is presented in Fig. 3.

From Fig. 3, utterances from line (1) to line (10) fall under performance con-text, whereby the user mainly inquires about details of performances. However, in line (11), the context has changed into reservation because user explicitly request for a reservation. Because informa tiveness is highly domain-specific, do-main attributes play significant roles in determining the amount of information contained in a particular utterance. Domain attributes enable the measurement of informativeness in an utterance when used to represent the topic and focus. 3.2 Domain Attributes Notice that example utterances in the p revious section contain proper names, phrases, and dates like Eugen Onegin , Krakow Opera , CJB ,or 27 January 1994 . This information corresponds to knowledge highly specific to the domain of SCHISMA. For example, Eugen Onegin is a title of performance, but Krakow Opera is the name of performing artist. This research adopts attribute-value pair formalism to represent information like &lt; title X  Eugen Onegin &gt; and &lt; artist X  Krakow Opera &gt; . With this regard, title and artist are known as domain at-tributes. The process to abstract out the domain knowledge is only a trivial task of searching and replacing the proper information into attribute forms. For example, the utterance (1) will be abstracted into the form of utterance (2). 1. The cost for Nabucco is ff23.00. 2. The cost for &lt; title &gt; is &lt; cost &gt; . 3.3 Topic and Focus The extraction of topic of utterance is based on the Information Theory [10], whereby topics are assessed depending on mood of utterance i.e., assertive, im-perative, or interrogative. According to this theory, the rule of thumb in deter-mining the mood is that topic is always the subject and focus is the object in an utterance. The challenging task, howeve r, is to access the subjects and objects because sentences vary in their structu ral form. The following are detailed de-scriptions for identifying the subjects and objects based on different classification of mood of utterance.
 Assertive. Assertions are declarative utterances that are used to make a state-ment or to declare some facts. In declarative utterances, topic is the part of the proposition that is being talked about (predicated), which is the subject of utter-ance. This includes  X  X es/No X  answer that responds to a question [16], which in this case the utterance will inherit topic from question utterance. For example: 1. Nabucco , played by Krakow Opera , is to be seen on 15 April 1994. 2. I find the Eugen Onegin is very interesting.

Utterance (1) shows a straightforward example to capture topic of utterance, whereby Nabucco is the subject hence title is the topic. Utterance (2) however, has a noun I as the subject, hence the object title Eugen Onegin is the topic. Imperative. Imperatives are command utterance, or utterance intended to instigate an action including an order, a request, an advice or a wish. Because the subject is often implied, topic corresponds to objects of utterance. For example: 1. I want 10 tickets, please! 2. In the date 27 January 1994, you can go to Nabucco . In utterance (1), the subject is I and objects are ticket, thus topic is ticket. Utterance (2), however, is an example of left-dislocation in sentence. Although the original subject is title or Nabucco , date has been topicalized through left-dislocation and becomes new subject. Therefore, date is the topic of utterance (3), while title becomes the focus of attention.
 Interrogative. Interrogative utterances are intended to elicit information from the listener, but not necessarily exists in qu estion form. Topic is usually expressed as the object of the verb, unless the wh -phrase is direct object or an adjunct, then the topic corresponds to the subject of the verb. For example: 1. Do you have a CJB card? 2. When Nabucco will be performed by the Krakow Opera ?
In utterance (1), the subject is you and object is CJB , a reduc. Since subject is a noun, both topic and focus will assume the value reduc. In utterance (2), title Nabucco is a direct object to  X  X hen X . Although title is a subject, it is the topic of utterance and artist becomes the focus of attention. Other utterances that do not fall to either of this mood will be extracted as  X  X ther X . This includes opening and closing utterances, as well a s utterances that are not covered in the domain, for instance utterance  X  X an I pay with Mastercard? X  or  X  X hat time the main floor opens? X .

Once the subject and object in utterances have been assessed, the following decision tree is proposed to summarize the process of extracting the topic and focus in dialogue utterances as shown in Fig. 4.
 3.4 Semantic Features Extracted Finally, Table 2 shows the semantic fea tures extracted from SCHISMA. The values such as title , person ,and reduc were manually crafted using domain infor-mation.ThetwodifferentcontextsinSCHISMAshowsthatitisatransaction dialogue because information-seeking dialogue has only one context.
 The entire of SCHISMA corpus is constituted by 64 dialogues of varied length. In total, there are 920 utterances belong to the user and 1,127 utterances be-long to the system. Because SCHISMA is mixed-initiative, the distribution of contribution from both the user and the system is also balance. This is opposed to the single-initiative dialogue system such as the traditional QA system where one party does all the asking and one party does all the answering. In corpus-based dialogue studies, modelin g general conversational behaviors in user utterances generally do not require any semantic information. Modeling ne-gotiations in transaction dialogues, however, is constrained by the timing and semantic content [17]. The first constraint, timing refers to the negotiation phases within transaction dialogues, for example opening, information, proposal, con-firmation, and closing. Timing in negotiation phases can only be determined with the aid of semantic interpretation of input utterances because the same communicative functions or intentions (refer Fig. 1) can occur in more than one negotiation phases (i.e., proposal vs. confirmation). Apart from semantic infor-mation, research in dialogue systems offer rich pragmatic information such as speech acts/intentions, grounding, and turn-taking. Conversational acts theory extended the account of speech acts by incorporating turn-taking, grounding, and discourse-level argumentation acts to describe conversation as a fully joint-action interaction [18]. In SCHISMA, the argumentation acts can be represented as phases during the negotiation such as proposal and confirmation.
While the semantic approach has been widely explored in the area of question answering (QA) and dialogue systems, the process of extracting the semantic within the sentence or utterance is also taking the standard natural language processing approach. In general, the steps involve tokenization to split the input utterance into a token of words, stemming to obtain the root words, and part-of-speech (POS) tagging to tag each root word with the POS component such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and others. The final process is extracting the nouns and assessing their semantics by checking against a dictionary or ontology of some sorts. This paper, on the contrary, attempts to provide an extraction process based on informativeness, which is basically the value of information that an utterance holds rather than based on keyword extractions.

It would be interesting to investigate whether the semantics from earlier ex-change of question and answer in a QA system has any influence over its rate of precision and recall. The goal can be achieved by comparing the results based on the use of semantic features from previous n utterances. Rationally, the more top-ics from the previous interaction that a system holds, the more contextual knowl-edge it has, and consequently the better results of precision and recall. However, the results may also deteriorated as the time-span of dialogue increased, which in this case comes the question of the optimal value for n . This paper laid the theoretical foundation and presented decision trees that will form the rules in extracting semantic features from a natural language input. The decision trees are relevant to dialogue systems, QA systems as well as natu-ral language interface (NLI) to ontologies. The extraction process was illustrated using a mixed-initiative, transactio n corpus called SCHISMA. The process be-gan by manually identifying a set of domain attributes in the corpus. From the domain attributes, semantic features such as the topic of utterance and focus of utterance were then extracted. In the future, the proposed decision trees will be applied in a question answering system to replace the traditional natural language processing approach such as keyword extraction in assessing the se-mantics. It is also hoped that this method could extend the capabilities in QA systems to answer queries within co ntext rather than in isolation.
