 We present a system called Risk-O-Meter to predict and an-alyze clinical risk via data imputation, visualization, predic-tive modeling, and association rule exploration. Clinical risk calculators provide information about a person X  X  chance of having a disease or encountering a clinical event. Such tools could be highly useful to educate patients to understand and monitor their health conditions. Unlike existing risk calcu-lators that are primarily designed for domain experts, Risk-O-Meter is useful to patients who are unfamiliar with medi-cal terminologies, or providers who have limited information about a patient. Risk-O-Meter is designed in a way such that it is flexible enough to accept limited or incomplete data in-puts, and still manages to predict the clinical risk efficiently and effectively. Current version of Risk-O-Meter evaluates 30-day risk of hospital readmission. However, the proposed system framework is applicable to general clinical risk pre-dictions. In this demonstration paper, we describe different components of Risk-O-Meter and the intelligent algorithms associated with each of these components to evaluate risk of readmission using incomplete patient data inputs.

Clinical risk calculators and risk assessment tools are use-ful services to educate patients as well as healthcare providers to monitor the development of health conditions. Risk calcu-lators are commonly used for diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke etc. However, most clinical risk cal-culators require adequate knowledge of medical terminolo-gies which are unfamiliar to regular patients. In addition, a sophisticated and effective predictive model often requires a large set of attribute values that may not all be available (or known) at the time when a patient or a healthcare provider uses the risk calculator. One recent popular risk calculator that predicts the risk-of-readmission related to heart attack, was proposed by the researchers at Yale University 1 . Un-fortunately, the usefulness of this tool is largely limited only to domain experts such as physicians, who posses adequate expertise on the domain and are aware of the values of all the attributes 2 .

In light of this opportunity, we develop Risk-O-Meter , an intelligent and effective system that allows predicting clini-cal risks with only limited user inputs. Novelty of Risk-O-Meter is manifold -a) Risk-O-Meter is worthwhile even to patients and healthcare providers, who are not necessarily domain experts. While the actual prediction algorithm is developed with the analyses of complex factors, unlike ex-isting risk calculators, it allows users to provide very simple inputs. b) Unlike existing calculators, it accepts incomplete patient input, thus offers higher flexibility. Moreover, it of-fers intelligent visualization of other pertinent factors of the similar patients, based on the input values. c) Finally, along with the risk calculation, Risk-O-Meter also suggests mean-ingful explanation behind such prediction. We note that the proposed framework inside Risk-O-Meter is generic and could be applicable to a wide variety of clinical risk pre-diction tasks. However, for the demonstration purpose, we instantiate the system to predict the risk-of-readmission for patients within 30-days of discharge.

Hospital readmission refers to patient admission to a hos-pital after being discharged from an earlier hospital stay. 30-day readmission rate is considered as an indicator for eval-uating the quality of care. In the U.S., starting from 2012, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) be-gan to use preventable readmission rates as a quality metric to determine the reimbursement to hospitals [4]. Predict-ing hospital readmission risk helps identify which patients would benefit most from care transition interventions, such as arranging a visiting nurse for the patient after the dis-charge. The topic has received a great deal of attention recently among healthcare professionals and researchers [3, 5, 6]. An effective risk calculator to assess the risk of 30-day hospital readmission risk can largely benefit patients and providers. This demo focuses on two tasks: predict and explain high risk of 30-day hospital readmission, and sum-marize and visualize the leading contributing factors. The proposed Risk-O-Meter has the following contributions:
In the rest of this paper, we first describe the technical specifications of Risk-O-Meter and then demonstrate appli-cation scenario with the system.
Risk-O-Meter is a web application to predict and analyze the risk of 30-day hospital readmission for a patient. The majority of the system components are precomputed and stored to increase the speed of the application. Figure 1 presents the system overview. Since the users can input any subset of the n input attributes presented in the interface, the first task is to map the input values to a group of patients who are most similar to the provided user profile. Therefore a set of clusters are precomputed as described in Section 2.2. The actual predictive models is built considering a larger at-tribute set, beyond the small set of attribute values specified by the user. Therefore, the inputted attribute set needs to be transformed to a larger set of attribute values on which the predictive model is trained. For that purpose, we maintain a cluster centroid which is used to complete the remaining missing attribute values. Additionally, we also visualize the characteristics of similar patients using top N pertinent at-tributes. Finally, we also offer an explanation behind the risk of readmission prediction using association rule mining. Given a set of input attribute values, we perform efficient matching to map the inputs to its closest cluster centroid. The centroid computation, visualization, predictive model training, and association rule mining are performed offline leveraging the properties of respective clusters, while the centroid matching is the only online process that takes place at runtime. Section 2.2 describes in details the offline sys-tem components and Section 2.3 presents the online cluster mapping algorithm.

Risk-O-Meter is primarily implemented using RStudio Shiny package 3 and Javascript. We use R project 4 to implement statistical analysis, clustering, predictive modeling, and as-sociation rules mining. The choice of the implementation al-lows us to combine extensible data mining algorithms, statis-tical analysis tools, and compelling data visualizations into a single web application.

In this section, we present the details of the five offline system components: clustering, building predictive models, visualizing cluster characteristics, coping with incomplete input, and explaining predictions.
 Clustering. To allow simple and incomplete patient in-put in Risk-O-Meter, we precompute the clusters based on different permutations of input attributes using K-mode al-gorithm. To accommodate all possible scenarios, we con-structed k  X  2 n clusters, where n is the number of attributes used in the predictive model and k is the predetermined number of clusters for each combination of user input (there is a total of 2 n permutations of attributes). For example, if a user inputs the age, gender, and blood pressure, he or she will be mapped to one of the k clusters built based on the three attributes. In this demo, we used 49 ( n = 49) attributes to train predictive models and set k = 5 based on the empirical experiments. Future work may explore meth-ods to automatically identify the optimal n and k param-eters. To allow efficient and speedy cluster mapping, we constructed an inverted index on the clusters as described in Section 2.3. Clustering is a necessary component for both Step 2 and 3 of the system as shown in Figure 2. http://rstudio.github.com/shiny/ http://www.r-project.org/ Building Predictive Models. We implemented Naive Bayes classifiers using the complete set of attributes ( n = 49) for each precomputed clusters. Naive Bayes classifier utilizes a probabilistic method for classification by multiplying the individual probabilities of every attribute-class pair. The method has been shown as one of the effective classifiers in [5]. The outcome of predictive modeling is shown in Step 2 (Figure 2).
 Visualizing Cluster Characteristics. We summarized the characteristics of a cluster via the analysis and visualiza-tion of significant contributors to high risk of readmission. Chi-Square test was used to discover the top N correlated at-tributes ranked by the P-value (observed significance level). This component implements Step 3 of the system (Figure 2).
 Coping with Incomplete Input. Coping with incomplete input data is similar to the problem of imputing missing values, a common problem in all types of medical research. In this demo, we use the precomputed cluster centroid to replace the missing values of the input data for the predic-tion. This component is part of the implementation for Step 2 (Figure 2).
 Explaining Predictions. We used Apriori association rules mining to identify patterns that may associated with high risk of readmission. For each cluster, we extracted rules of high support and confidence scores. We then summarized the discovered patterns for each cluster in a paragraph as part of the cluster feature. This component is also part of the implementation for Step 2 (Figure 2).
One novelty of Risk-O-Meter is its flexibility in accepting inputs from the user. In the user interface, the user enters all or only a subset of the attribute values that she is aware of. After that, the task is to map the inputted parameters of the patient to a cluster of patients in our database that she resembles the most. More specifically, the process thus be-comes computing the similarity (or distance) [2] between the cluster-centroid and the inputted values and selecting that centroid that has the highest similarity (smallest distance) with the inputs. While we are aware of several measures to compute similarity or distance, our current implementation considers Cosine Similarity [2] for that purpose. However, since the total number of materialized cluster centroids is exponential (actually, k  X  2 m , where k -clusters are material-ized for each possible subset of m attributes in the predictive modeling) to the number of attributes ( m ) in the input user interface, the challenge is to be able to perform this sim-ilarity computation efficiently at run-time (after the user has specified the inputs). We propose an effective indexing scheme to that end that bears resemblance with inverted-index [1] in IR literature. The advantage of using this index-ing scheme is it avoids the exponential number of similarity computation (given the input parameters) at run-time, and only performs k searches to find out the centroid with the highest Cosine Similarity.

Intuitively, the indexing scheme is designed as follows: For every possible subset of attributes, a list of k centroids are pre-computed and materialized. The inverted index file con-tains 2 m rows (each corresponds to a subset of attributes), and each row contains a list of k cluster centroids (consid-ering distribution of values of that attribute subset). Given input values on a subset of attributes, the task is to first perform an efficient look-up into the index file to retrieve the row that corresponds to that attribute subset, and then perform k similarity computations (one for each centroid) to find the centroid with highest similarity. Assuming that one can perform constant time look-up to retrieve the row in the index-file given the inputted attributed set, the complexity of finding the best clustered centroid becomes at O ( k ) in our case.

By leveraging the cluster centroid along with the inputted attribute values, the trained predictive model outputs the clinical risk of the input patient profile. In this section, we use a cohort provided by MultiCare Health System 5 to demonstrate Risk-O-Meter. The cohort consists approximately 8,600 patients diagnosed with heart failure.Figure 2 shows a screenshot of Risk-O-Meter. Our demonstration contains three main steps: 1) flexible user input; 2) prediction and explanation; and 3) real-time data exploration and visualization.

As shown in Figure 2, Step 1 involves the web form on the left displaying first the intuitive input fields. Although, if possible, a user can provide complete information for all the required attributes (49 attributes in the predictive mod-eling), the system can accommodates limited partial inputs. For example, a user can provide only the age(=71), gen-der(=M), ethnic group(=African American), the history of diabetes(=yes), and the blood pressure( &lt; 130/80). When the  X  X alculate Risk X  button is clicked, Risk-O-Meter maps the user profile to the closest cluster and display the predic-tion in Step 2.
 Step 2 outputs the probability of prediction obtained from Naive Bayes classifier. In addition, it presents the explana-tion generated from association rule mining process. In the screenshot, the provided input values, combined with the additional attribute values imputed from the centroid of the assigned cluster, lead to 72% probability of 30-day readmis-sion. Association rule mining offers an explanation behind risk calculation, for example, for the attached screenshot, it explains that males in the age group of 70s with diabetes have high risk of readmission. Users of Risk-O-Meter may decide whether they want to learn more about the cluster by clicking the  X  X xplore Data X  button.

Step 3 explores and visualizes the characteristics of the assigned cluster for the given input values. It shows that the top three contributor to readmission are history of de-pression, discharge severity, and history of pneumonia. The stacked bar charts shows the distributions of people readmit-ted to hospital within 30 days for each factor. For example, we observe that patients similar to the given profile tends to have level 3 discharge severity, and several patients in our dataset with discharge severity 3 tends to exhibit high risk or 30-day readmission.
In this paper, we propose Risk-O-Meter, a system aims to predict and analyze clinical risk via data imputation, vi-sualization, predictive modeling, and association rule explo-ration. Risk-O-Meter is designed for patients and healthcare providers, who may only have a limited or incomplete infor-http://www.multicare.org/ mation at the time they use a risk calculator. One novelty of Risk-O-Meter, compared to currently available clinical risk calculators, is the capability to efficiently and effectively ex-trapolate the limited input values to a meaningful group of patient data to proceed the prediction and analyses. More-over, Risk-O-Meter provides explanation of risk predictions and intelligent visualization of other patients similar to the given patient profile, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first ever risk calculation tool with the improved func-tionalities.
