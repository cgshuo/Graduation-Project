 This paper addresses blog feed retrieval where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant blog feeds for a given user query. Since the retrieval unit is a blog, as a collection of posts, performing relevance feedback techniques and selecting the most appropriate documents for query expansion becomes challenging. By assuming time as an effective parameter on the blog posts content, we propose a time-based query expansion method. In this method, we select terms for ex-pansion using most relevant days for the query, as opposed to most relevant documents. This provide us with more trustable terms for expansion. Our preliminary experiments on Blog08 collection shows that this method can outperform state of the art relevance feedback methods in blog retrieval.

Blog search users often wish to identify and subscribe to blogs that regularly write about a given topic. The goal of blog feed search, also called blog distillation, is to provide users with such blogs [6]. It is different from traditional ad-hoc search since the retrieval unit is a blog (a collection of the posts), not a single document.

One of the open challenges in blog retrieval is relevance feedback and employing the most appropriate documents for query expansion. It has been shown that traditional pseudo relevance feedback methods can not achieve any significant improvement in blog retrieval [2]. Using the top retrieved posts can not cover all the aspects of the query, and using the top retrieved feeds would add noise because not all the posts in them are relevant [4]. State of the art methods, use the top posts in the top retrieved feeds in order to have both coverage and relevance in the selected terms [4].

One of the main properties of blogs is their temporal be-haviour. On one hand, content of blogs can change over time. On the other hand, topics can evolve over time and different aspects of the topic might be discussed in different
Among the mentioned methods, the  X  X op Feeds X  method has the possibility to expand the query with non-relevant terms. The reason is that all the posts in a top retrieved feed are not necessarily relevant to the topic. On the other hand, the  X  X op Posts X  method might not have enough cov-erage on all the sub-topics of the query, because the top retrieved posts might be mainly relevant to some dominant aspect of the query. FFBS and WFBS methods were origi-nally proposed in order to have more coverage than the  X  X op Posts X  method while selecting more relevant terms than the  X  X op Feeds X  method [4].
We propose a time-based relevance model where we as-sume that the date has effect on the terms written for a specific topic. In other word, we assume that the generative model of the query first selects a date and then select a term based on the date and the query: where P ( w | day,Q ) shows the importance of the term in a given day for the query and P ( day | Q ) shows the importance of a day for the query. These probabilities are estimated as follows: where p shows a post and p  X  day means the post is pub-lished in the specified day. P ( p | day,Q ) is set to be uniform for all the posts in each day. score ( p,Q ) defines the similar-ity score of the post for the given query and in our experi-ments is calculated using language modeling technique with Dirichlet smoothing.

The assumption is that selecting the expansion terms based on time would provide us with a better coverage over sub-topics than the Top Posts method. On the other hand, since we use the top retrieved posts in the expansion phase, we add less irrelevant terms than the Top Feeds method. This model has two parameters including the number of the posts considered in the expansion phase and the number of the terms selected for expansion.
To evaluate our methods we use the TREC Blog08 data collection that is a collection of about 1 million blogs crawled over a year [6]. We use only the permalinks component of the data which consist of approximately 28.4 million documents in the collection. We use the Terrier Information Retrieval system 1 to index the collection. http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/terrier/
