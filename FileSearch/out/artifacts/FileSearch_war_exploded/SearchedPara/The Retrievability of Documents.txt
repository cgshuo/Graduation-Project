 Retrievability is an important and interesting indicator that can be used in a number of ways to analyse Information Retrieval systems and document collections. Rather than focusing totally on relevance, retrievability examines what is retrieved, how often it is retrieved, and whether a user is likely to retrieve a document or not. This is important because a document needs to be retrieved, before it can be judged for relevance. In this tutorial, we shall explain the concept of retrievability along with a number of retrievabil-ity measures, how it can be estimated and how it can be used for analysis. Since retrieval precedes relevance, we shall also provide an overview of how retrievability relates to effective-ness -describing some of the insights that researchers have discovered so far. We shall also show how retrievability re-lates to efficiency, and how the theory of retrievability can be used to improve both effectiveness and efficiency. Then we shall provide an overview of the different applications of retrievability such as Search Engine Bias, Corpus Profiling, etc., before wrapping up with challenges and opportunities. The final session of the day will look at example problems and ways to analyse and apply retrievability to other prob-lems and domains.

Prior to this, he received his Ph.D. in Computing Science from the University of Paisley in 2006, after he received a First Class Honours Degree in Information Science from the University of Newcastle, Australia, 2001. In 2008, he in-troduced the notion of Retrievability in the context of In-formation Retrieval. Since then, he and co-authors have
