 Interdisciplinary design is ch allenging, in large measure, because of the difficulty in communicating and coordinating across disciplines. Many tools have been developed and used to support information sharing in design, and the use of WWW technology is becoming increasingly important for the sharing of information. Wikis, in par ticular, have been claimed to support collaboration and information sharing. The backing for this claim, however, has not b een rigorously assessed and to date few empirical studies have appeared in the literature. For my dissertation, I am c onducting a field study of interdisciplinary design projects, seeking to discover how wikis enable information sharing in software development projects. The research findings will expand our understanding of information sharing behavior of design professionals. It will also provide empirical evidence on the use of wikis in design work, which will be used to de velop guidelines on the effective use of wikis to support design collaboration. H4.3 [Information systems a pplications]: Communication Applications; H.5.3 [Information interfaces and presentation]: Group and Organization Interfaces  X  CSCW Management, Docume ntation, Design Wikis, information sharing, interdisciplinary design Successful design in many domains (e.g., software design, user interface design, product design, and engineering design, etc.) requires collaboration among various disciplines because, in general, individual members from a single discipline do not have all of the information, know ledge, and expertise needed for solving a design problem. As a result, design seems to have become even more interdisciplin ary than in the past [4]. Interdisciplinary design has created challenges in design collaboration due to the difficulty in communicating and coordinating across disciplines [3]. Team members from different disciplines may view and solve the same problem from different perspectives, with their own unique method and language, which may create barriers to information sharing. Information and communication technologies (ICTs), when configured for disciplinary and organizational constructs, can improve collaboration. More recently, design teams have begun to employ wikis, editable websites, to do such things as: collaborating across locations; brainstorming and tracking projects; organizing fragmen ted knowledge and facilitating information exchange with in corporations [5]. Wikis have been claimed to provide a number of potential advantages. Most notably they are claimed to support design collaboration [1]. The backing for this claim, however, has not been rigorously assessed and to da te few empirical studies have appeared in the literature. Many empirical studies have focused on the use of wikis in other contexts such as corporate and Wikipedia [5, 6]. I have been asking the following general questions in my dissertati on: How do design teams, and individual team members, use wi kis? To what extent do wikis support information sharing in interdisciplinary design? Wikis are often held to be simple but in what exact ways are Wikis simple (if at all)? These and si milar questions require empirical investigation so that a firmer conceptual understanding for information sharing and management in design can be obtained. The objectives of my dissertation are to: (1) Study how interdisciplinary design teams use wikis; (2) Identify best practices for the effective use of wikis; and (3) Examine how wikis might be enhanced to be tter support information sharing in design projects. Specifically, the proposed dissertation will answer the following research questions: To understand how design team members use wikis to share information during the design process  X  what and how they actually share information  X  and be able to best utilize wikis to support information sharing, I draw on an integrative framework for managing knowledge across bounda ries (3-T framework) [2] and Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) [7] to conceptualize various information sharing ac tivities during design processes and to adequately understand how wikis are, and could be, used to support information sharing in interdisciplinary design. The 3-T framework is used as a means to conceptualize information sharing during design and devel opment processes, while the CWA framework brings into account factors that may affect information sharing and the use of wikis. To answer the research que stions, I am conducting an exploratory study. I have studied 5 interdisciplinary design teams from 3 organizations that use wikis as their primary information sharing a nd management system. Data collection and analysis are guided by both the 3-T framework and CWA framework. I have been collecting both qualitative and quantitative data using multi-method data collection strategy in order to pr ovide rich data about the use of wikis. These methods include observations, interviews, review of wiki organization and design, and analysis of wiki change logs. Observations are conducted to fully understand information sharing practices and how wikis fit into the design process, which may be difficult to capture by interviews. The objective of interviews is to gain a better understanding on how and why individual design team members use wikis from their own perspectives. Las tly, I am currently analyzing project wiki sites, both content and log file, to gain addition insight on wiki usage. To date, I have completed data collection with 4 design teams, and have begun the data analysis. Data collection and data analysis are still in progress. However, preliminary analysis of the da ta from two design teams suggests the following themes: The results of this dissertation will contribute to the body of knowledge in the several areas. Th e analysis of empirical data will be used to develop a conceptual model of information sharing, which is intended to capture the complexity of information sharing activities of design professionals. This dissertation will also contribute to the boundary-spanning concept used in knowledge mana gement research by assessing the capability of the boundary-spanning framework on explaining information sharing through wikis between disciplinary groups during the design process. This dissertation will particularly be important for the wiki research community because it will provide empirical evidence on the use of wikis in design work, which seems to be a common purpose for wikis. This dissertation will also broaden our understanding of how collaborative technologies could be developed to particularly support information sharing across disciplines, which is crucial to interdisciplinary collaboration. In addition to theoretical contributions, this dissertation will offer practical contributions in several ways. The study results will be used to develop guidelines on the effective use of wikis, especially adoption and evolving use. By examining the wiki technology that is employed by design teams, the study will reveal technological adoption and appropriation practices, and in turn inform how wikis could be appropriated to support information sharing across disciplinary boundaries during design process. Guided by CWA, the study will generate a set of recommendations for design and de velopment of wikis, which in turns be useful for de signing and developing various collaborative technologies so that they could effectively support interdisciplinary design collaboration.
