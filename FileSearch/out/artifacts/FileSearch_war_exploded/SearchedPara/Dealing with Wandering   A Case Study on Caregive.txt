 We present an empirical study that is being conducted in the context of developing a GPS locati ng system for individuals with Alzheimer X  X  disease (AD) in Germany. A disposition of wandering is one of the most probl ematic symptoms as it fosters anxiety, disorientation and can even lead to life-threatening situations. Our qualitative empirical study contributes to the research on social phenomena which reveals some technical implications for the developmen t of location-based services (LBS) in dementia care. We demonstrate that common concepts such as the dilemmas  X  X warene ss vs. privacy X  in general and  X  X afety vs. autonomy X  in the c ontext of monitoring systems for wandering patients need to be t ackled from practice-based views. Our study attempts to understand caregivers X  practices and attitudes towards these concepts. D.2.10 [ Design ]: Methodologies . H.5.2.

In Germany, where the project is located, more than 1.1 million people are affected by this disease. Symptoms of AD are progressing me mory loss, disorientation in time, loss of spatial orientation, and progressing loss of awareness of the own personality  X  a process which currently can neither be averted nor hindered. A dispositi on of wandering is one of the most problematic symptoms as it fosters anxiety, disorientation and can even lead to life-threatening situations [20]. For caregivers the wandering symptom may cause overwhelming stress since ambulatory dementia patients must often be under constant watch. We aim at developing applications which allow the localization of demented persons. The design of these applications touches a highly sensitive issue: These applications intrude upon the privacy of persons who are not able to give their consent for being monitored. This means that decisions on the usage of a monitoring device need to be taken by someone else, e.g. the caregiver or a close relative. Furthermore, people base this decision on certain criteria which stem from the very social context. Research has already shown that the use of location-based systems (LBS) is highly socially embedded. People develop and accomplish different strategies to personally deal with the inherent trade-off between (keeping) privacy and (fostering and installing) awareness in social networks [22]. Related research has elicited concepts, strategies, and motives which are related to privacy issues from the users X  point of view. Concerning privacy issues in the application field of dementia care, literature provides a core dilemma reflected by caregivers X  attitudes towards LBS for persons with dementia: The safety of the demented persons versus keep ing their autonomy [17]. This is an important aspect to understand how caregivers classify privacy issues from this certain user pers pective. It was our attempt to research into attitudes and practices in dementia care concerning wandering behavior and potential LBS support. By doing so, our results confirm that the named dilemma is important in the context of LBS usage for persons suffering from dementia. However, we wish to contribut e to a more detailed understanding of what  X  X afety X  and  X  X utonomy X  means against the background of different attitudes, practices a nd conditions of care situations. We accomplished 21 semi-standardized interviews on the basis of a Grounded Theory approach [21] with family caregivers and professional caregivers working in daycare and nursing homes. We describe the core findings of our research to illustrate and reflect aspects of  X  X afety vs. autonomy X  which have not been discussed in the literature so far. We expect a significant impact of the qualitative work on the development, acceptance, and usage of location technologies in the application domain. The next chapter provides a litera ture review on location-based systems and privacy  X  discussing general important aspects and particular privacy concerns of our target group. Then we explain our methodological approach in more detail and subsequently report on the results of our empi rical case study. Eventually, we discuss in how far our findings gui de us to the next technology development steps and finally, a conclusion is given. A common concern of ubiquitous systems is that awareness has often conflicted with the desire of privacy. Privacy issues are not trivial even in everyday applications. In the domain of dementia care giving, the situation becomes trickier. As many elders who suffer from middle or severe dementia are no longer self-responsible, then who should make the privacy-related decisions? The tension between awareness and privacy has always been hotly discussed in CSCW research. Awareness supports cooperation while at the same time it makes personal behavior visible [1, 3, 6, 13, 23]. Back in 1996, Friedman first introduced the approach of value-sensitive design [8]. Camp et al. refined this approach in 2006 by suggesting risk profiled data collection, data filtering before storage, a nd taking user groups X  requirements into account during the design as a concrete approach [4]. They introduced three principles for pr ivacy preservation in ubiquitous systems: transparency, consent, and correction. For our research focus on demented care giving, consent and correction are both problematic issues. Firstly, the principle consent means that the data collection could occur only w ith the consent of the monitored persons or their caregivers. It is hard to clarify, who (the demented or the caregiver) has the right to permit the consent. Secondly, principle correction mean s that incorrect data can be altered or removed. However, de mented patients may tend to alter data or erase data by mistake. Kobsa argued that it is hard to find a uniform solution for privacy demands since both user preferences and legal stipulations are too heterogeneous. He suggested that a personalized privacy level could be a solution to these problems [15]. While there is a fair amount of theoretical research on privacy preserving in design, there are only few practical methods for providing users with a proper privacy level. Hong et al. proposed privacy risk models as a general method for refining privacy from an abstract concept into a set of concrete concerns for a specific domain and community [12]. Taking care of elders who suffe r from AD involves even more privacy issues. Demented patients who live in professional assisted living facilities often lack privacy. In assisted living environments bathrooms and bedr ooms are often shared rather than private [18]. Although there are also non-shared environments, nursing home resident s are often assisted by caring staff in activities that are normally seen as private, e.g. bathing. The situation of home care giving is quite different then. Aging close to home is preferable for several reasons. It is normally less expensive for a person to reside in their home rather than receive professional care at an assisted living facility. Elderly overwhelmingly prefer to stay in their own home rather than move to unfamiliar environments. However, home care giving still cannot be exempted from privacy concerns. For example, desi gners of home caring systems commonly assume that using visu al sensing devices to monitor residents as a means of ensuring safety is unacceptable because of privacy invasion [2]. An alternative approach is to track the potentially wandering elders with always-on and always-worn trackers [9, 14]. The concept of tracking people with GPS data exists in many social LBS system s, e.g. Foursquare [7] or Google Latitude [11]. As long as these products are aimed at ordinary user groups, the privacy issue is ha ndled quite well, as these users have full control of their positioning data; they are fully responsible of whether they woul d like to be tracked. But in the case of tracking AD patients, many things can go wrong. For the sake of privacy, we may let the AD patients decide whether they should be tracked or not. But from the safety perspective, as they are no longer self-responsible, one c ould ask if their decisions still count? There is always a dilemma between safety and autonomy from the perspective of the caregivers. Corresponding studies exist, but without uniform results . In the study of Landau et al. [17], professional caregivers attached higher respect to a person X  X  autonomy and would rather restrict the support of GPS tracking. However, family caregivers claimed that dementia patients in nursing homes were overprotected [19]. Professional caregivers in nursing houses preferred safety to autonomy when patients were under their care. It is thought that such a contrast in different views between professional caregivers is due to the different stadium of dementia patients. Those in late stadium moved to nursing houses because they needed more safety [19]. Interestingly however, not all situ ations can be clearly weighted toward either safety or autonomy. There are also situations with intermediate positions or where th ese two perspectives co-exist. There is still much for us to research on that. From a technical perspective of view, the major concern of location privacy is the potential abuse of clients X  location data, which may imply sensitive personal information. To support location anonymity, existing re search reduces a location resolution by ensuring that each location reported to a service provider is a cloaking area that c ontains at least K mobile nodes. The work of Toby et al. in 2007 [24] introduced a strategy especially for continuous LBS applications, which require a frequent location update. The goal of this work is to provide a given level of anonymity protection and to keep the cloaking area as small as possible. In the paper of Chow et al., the privacy in 5 different system architectures was discussed [5]. How to anonymize personal locations and how to provide users with high quality services on the basis of anonymized locations were the important research questions discussed. However, for the application field of dementia care there is too little knowledge on related appropriate technological s upport, as well as on the social handling and reflection of privacy issues from the users X  (mainly caregivers X ) point of view. In order to be able to regard attitudes, concerns and reflections of caregivers towards privacy and autonomy issues, and to reflect them against the background of a wider societal and social background in Germany, we used a qualitative research design explained in the following chapter. Some reflections on technological features in LBS based on the empirical study will be given in the discussion chapter. However, this paper mainly aims at desc ribing empirical results from our study. Since our research goal is to elicit practices, attitudes and reflections on dealing with wande ring behavior of persons with dementia we chose a qualitative-empirical interview study. We accomplished 21 semi-standardized interviews on the basis of a methodological framework informed by Grounded Theory methodology [21]. From the findings in literature we started to scrutinize two relevant fields and searched for according interview partners  X  namely family caregivers who live with their demented relatives at home, and professional caregivers in retirement homes. During the interviews we detected the need to scrutinize more among the two groups. We learned that differences exist in coping with the every-day life of a demented relative in the familial context. For example, when the caregiver is a spouse, or an adult daughter or son, or simply differences between being a male or female caregiver. In the course of the interview pha se we also learned that we had to differentiate more exactly among professional caregivers of nursing homes for a deeper understanding of the handling of demented individuals. We differe ntiated between professionals who are working directly with the demented persons, such as nurses on a ward and persons in management positions who do not have much of a direct interaction with the patients. Thus, we subsequently looked for related in terview partners by constantly comparing the materials gathered and analyzed. All in all we interviewed 6 family caregivers (4 female and 2 male), 2 of them wives and one husband of a deme nted person and two daughters and one son-in-law. On the part of the professional caregivers we interviewed altogether 15 persons , among them 6 worked directly on a ward with the demented and 9 were in management positions. In addition to the interv iews we met regularly with a local self-help organization which also helped us with finding interview partners. It also provided us with a good amount of leap of faith that we needed for getting in touch with caregivers who carry a high work load and, in the most cases, are rather critical against technological support, mainly due to their low technical affinity. Each interview lasted between one to two hours and was audio-taped when allowed to. Some in terview partners did not permit the audio record. In these cases, detailed interview notes were elaborated upon immediately after the interview. The audio material has been transcribed and all interviews have been analyzed by using the coding paradigm of Strauss &amp; Corbin (1990). We were mainly interested in conditions, context, strategies and consequences of activities the caregivers reported. We were also interested in refl ections of their individual way of caring for demented persons, especially in regard to technological support. None of the interviewees were using GPS technology at the time of the interviews, but a ll had reflected on the question of a potential usage before. This is a quite representative situation for Germany. Interestingly, there are some providers of GPS locating systems on the market. However, the target group of such providers is made of technologically skilled persons who exactly know what to look for and how to use such systems. For people who lack advance technical skills, the market appears rather transparent. In addition, due to the general low technical affinity of caregivers and in familial cases due to the often higher age of the caring partners such technologies are concurrently only seldom being purchased and used. Regarding the question  X  X hich exte nt of autonomy is a demented person ascribed to (e.g. leavi ng the home on his or her own)? X , most of the professionals say that each individual case needs a precise consideration  X  X hether it is justifiable X  (Int. Hr. V..) and whether it would be a case for a technological support. The basis of the assessment is an exact observation of the affected person:  X  X ou need to see which person it is? It needs to be reflected in every case of wandering...it is impor tant to ask: does he or she feel comfortable when he or sh e is allowed to leave the house? X  (Int. Hr. V.) Interestingly, many of the profe ssional persons do not reflect that question in the first line due to the actual cognitive skills of the demented patient but due to the degree of their wellbeing, as one professional illustrates this with one example:  X  X  remember Mrs. F.: she was so stranded that I ne arly had tears in my eyes [when I found her standing disoriented on the road]. In this case I would decide: no! She was standing there and did not know where she should go now. She was so glad when I started talking to her and accompanied her back to our house. X  (Int. Hr. V.) On the other hand he imagines that for other patients, who enjoy being allowed to leave the house on their own, technological support would be a good help:  X  X  could imagine other demented persons who were glad of being let alone. X  Another professional person even mentioned certain happiness in the face of demented persons which she recognized when being brought back to the house after they had managed to  X  X scape X . This kind of opinion for wellbeing of the demented is being stressed especially by professiona ls in managing positions as the most important decision criterion for whether demented persons should be allowed to leave the hous e on their own. As such, this accepts a possible degree of endangerment, e.g. due to road traffic:  X  X ach person has a certain risk of life, regardless of dementia or not; and this has to be accepted. When she is walking to her shop at the corner each day and this makes her happy... it is important for her...it is a we ll-known place to her...this gives her day a certain structure and by this, gives her a sense of security. X  (Int. Fr. O.) Another manager of a retiremen t home defines the question of providing freedom to demented persons and the according discrepancy of being responsible for their safety from a quite extreme point of view:  X  X k, one should not provoke that demented leave the house on their own. But on the other hand you must see: what is our most precious asset? People have demonstrated for the freedom of will and today people still demonstrate for that. It is a pr ecious good that we can utter our free will. And when a demented person says that he or she wants to go outside and not only into the [protected] garden, that he or she wishes to leave the house on his or her own, then I need to let him or her go. And when I cannot manage to convince him that the garden would be the better opti on then I must let him/her go. X  (Int. Fr. L.) These comments show that our first idea that it would be a good idea to preventively give a GPS system to all wandering demented persons to guarantee their safety and to reduce the caregivers X  burden does not always match the attitudes and estimations of the caregivers. The question of safety is not always a reason for evaluating a technological device as helpful. That is why a technological device is not seen per se as helpful  X  and this is not evaluated primarily agai nst data privacy concerns. However, these statements need to be regarded against another finding in this context -that th ese more  X  X iberal X  positions were mainly uttered by professionals in managing positions who argue from a background of actual standard s of dementia care that favor a patient-centered, subjective approach. In addition, managing personnel often argue against the background of legal aspects. Nursing homes are regulated by law to very carefully deal with freedom from restraints. In Germany, in the last decades detailed standards have been institutiona lized and controlled in such homes to prevent the elderly from being illegitimately fixed (e.g. fixed in bed or in a chair). Fixation still comes up when discussing new, more subject-o riented care concepts which strongly focus on the patients X  wellbeing. Having said this, the former utte rances appear as attempts to provide a certain  X  X olitical correctness X  by the management personnel. This seems to be even more the case when looking at the according utterances of non-managing personnel. Caregivers who work in direct interaction with the demented and who therefore are more in a permanent concern for their safety, often think differently of letting people go when they express this wish. These caregivers rather consider safety concerns and worry about the demented persons getting lost. A deliberate and active  X  X et them go X  attitude is often not evaluated to be a realistic option when the demented person has reached a certain degree of disorientation. In this section we will elaborate a bit deeper into the topic of changing dementia care concepts and their relation to societal exchange processes and perceptions . It is important to understand concepts of professional caregivers towards possible usage and acceptance of technological aids for patients who wander. An interview partner in a manage ment position tells the story of a demented inhabitant who had left the house unperceived and managed to take a train and travel to her hometown, 500 kilometers away. When she arrived at that city, some people got attentive and brought her to the police. There, she was not able to say her name and her destination, but she remembered the name of the nursing home she lives in 500 kilometers away. Finally, police organized a return transport by taxi.  X  X e and she were so lucky that she at least could reme mber the name of our house. But all in all, she looked so happy when she took off the taxi. She had a real feeling of happiness. X  (Int. Fr. L.) The interviewee stressed the patient X  X  feeling of happiness in order to stress the fact that to her a certain level of freedom and autonomy is still important when being demented. But her subsequent utterance rela tivizes this when she reflects on the danger of affecting the reputation of the home. She refers to a general perspective taken by th e German press towards nursing homes, which are quite fast in developing negative banner headlines:  X  X hen this lady came back I thought of what could have happened! You immediately think of the news headlines:  X  X ursing home loses inhabitant. X  This is very bad for our public reputation. X  The fear of a damaged reputation is an important topic for all managing personnel in the sample. Reflection on the usage of monitoring technology is in most cases related to these concerns. Here, concerns on data protection and according negative resonance in the press is being mentioned as a factor for a rejection of monitoring devices. Expectations of some relatives of demented inhabitants of nursing homes are being seen as anothe r issue which frames the handling with wandering persons:  X  X t is impossible to constantly watch a person 365 days per year; 24 hours... we cannot give you a guarantee. But there is this freque nt expectation: we pay for our demented relative and this all inclusive package includes that all doors are permanently closed. X (Int. Fr. H.) These high aimed and from her point of view unrealistic expectations as a consequence would lead to unfair assessments of nursing homes. To her, this often leads to the fact that even managers of nursing homes do sometimes not handle this issue in a fair way:  X  X very manager who says that in her house nobody ever has managed to escape must be lying. X  Here, a clash understanding of good care between professionals and relatives is obvious. Due to their emotional bonds and related sorrow and anxiety relatives of inhabitants predominantly focus on safety aspects. In contrast, due to a concurrent alteration of care concepts in Germany towards a more subject-centered and autonomy focused care approach many care professionals have different claims and values con cerning this point. Also, regarding the interviews with relatives w ho care for a demented person at home we have learned that the modern concepts of healthcare are noticed and practiced rather seldom.  X  X o put a GPS device on every wandering inhabitant is too extreme to my mind. Because I think that certain people who have this strong impulse need to be given the freedom to wander. You cannot keep these persons here permanently. X  This very tolerant and patient-ori ented remark is being relativized by the same interviewee with the permanent problem of the deficit of personnel in German nur sing homes. This deficit is one of the main reasons why a suchlike position often cannot be practiced, as it is impossible to assign every wandering person an assistant who joins her/him on her/his way outside the home. However, this thought of assisti ng wanderers is being seen as a form that offends the freedom fro m restraints, as not every one wishes to be accompanied all the time. On the other hand, a GPS device  X  even when it is not liked in general against the background of modern care concepts  X  is being taken into account as a possible solution against the background of the human resources situation. Taking care of the demented patients is a challenging job for the family caregivers. Because of this huge demand of time and attention, the caring work is normally taken by more than one family caregiver. Most of thes e caregivers are the children and husband or wife of the demented. In some extreme situations, e.g. both the parents are demented, sometimes a professional caregiver is hired to live with the demented parents and help with the caring work. The caregiving work is distributed in a way which is similar to a shift work. That mean s that there is only one caregiver at a time to keep an eye on the demented (one to one). In the meantime the other caregivers can relax and enjoy their pastime.  X  If my mother is not there, th en I will keep an eye on father. For example, when he X  X  back from th e walk, he often cannot open the door, although he has the key with him. Then I will open the door and let him in. X  (Int. Fr. B) Things become serious if the deme nted patient gets lost. All the caregivers will be engaged in looking for her/him. In some situations, other family relatives or neighbors will also be asked for help.  X  X  suddenly noticed that she is not by my side. I called my son, he came and searched nearby roads with the car and didn X  X  find her... Neighbors also help ed us look for her. And one neighbor finally found her and brought her back. X  (Int. Hr. B.) When we look into the situations in stationary professional caregiving institutes, things are only a little different. Most of the time, the professionals are working collaboratively taking care of a group of patients (group to group). In some cases, another group will take over the job temporarily so that one group can have a rest.  X  X ometimes we send the pa tients to the XXX-group. They will talk with our patients, or sometimes have dinner together with them. That really gives us some relief. X  (Int. Fr. I) When a patient happens to be wandering out of the institute, similar to the situations of family caregivers, all the professional caregivers will be gathered and organized to look for the lost patient. The approach normally goes in this order: looking inside the building, call the patient X  X  relatives, look outside, and finally call the police. None of the interviewed family or professional caregivers has mentioned any communication/colla boration systems to be used when looking for the wandering patient. The lack of communication could result in a low efficiency and accuracy in wandering finding. We asked the caregivers about their experience with patients who get lost. Almost all the interviewees told us that patients always have their favorite wandering routes. These routes can be the way home, or a personally favorite path.  X  X e need to look into the biography of the patients: where do they live, before [they move in our house]...Because if they are wandering, they may just go home. X  (Int. Fr. K)  X ... because people often have cer tain routes, where they would like to take a walk. She told me that she has found a nice path in the field, and she X  X  like to take a walk there...Now I know that the real situation is not what she told me...If I had a system [to analyze her history path], then I could know which direction I should go [to find her]. X  (Int. Hr. W) The professional caregivers do not feel a lack in their competences when deciding on the question if a demented person should be allowed to leave the house on her/his own. Often named criteria are state of the wellbeing of the person (does she feel good when she is on her own) and the level of endangering due to the severity of the dementia a nd their general behavior (does he/she always take the same path). But for the decision of the question on the usage of a monito ring system some see problems in their actual professional competences. They feel that this decision is going beyond their competences and also their responsibilities. One of the professi onals sees his job here rather as a moderator of the decision process:  X  X hat do the relatives think about a potential GPS support, and what do the children want? It is my job to organize the care and to make sure that everything is being accomplished correctly. For the philosophy of life...if a person is being given the freedom to walk through the front door, staffed with a GPS system, and this is a philosophy...I feel overwhelmed with that. I would rather see myself as a moderator of such a decision-making process among the concerned parties [i.e. th e spouses, children, attending doctors, nurses]. I could introduce such a technology and say  X  X ook, we have such options, how shall we proceed now? X  X . (Int. Hr. V.) Another professional stresses the aspect of the need for securing the right decision. This nursing director bases her argument on the problem of intervening in personal rights when the person is not able to give his or her consent. That is why she  X  as well as her colleagues  X  stresses the common decision on  X  X hat to do on behalf of the wellbeing of the patient X  . For her a common decision process is important i ndependent from the question of GPS devices. To her the intervention in personal rights is a daily concern when caring for demented persons. And a common decision-making process is to he r a supplementary and important aspect of taking decisions safely:  X  X e reflect a lot: measures are always discussed with the attending doctor, with the relatives, and, if possible, with the patients X . All try to find a good solution for the wellbeing of the patient. It is a system of persons who all know the patient and his needs very well. (Int.Fr. P) In this case, security must also be regarded in the sense of legal security. The interviewee reflects in this context on the problem of dealing with the patients X  right of freedom from restraints, such as fixation of the inhabitants in bed or in a chair, but also bed rails. The handling is defined by law and supervised by district judges. However, the level of au sterity sometimes varies between judges. This makes it hard for the interviewee as she has to report to two different judges. This is due to the fact that the inhabitants have lived in different districts before they moved to the nursing home. In this situation the nursing director feels a high pressure due to sometimes different require ments by the different judges. That is why her main strategy is to pool the responsibility for important decisions on different shoulders. In contrast to the approach of involving family relatives in important decisions, such as the usage of a locating device, there is also an attitude among professional caregivers which is directed to the evaluation of family care concepts of being not right and not good for the demented. Often professionals find relatives often too anxious and too much personally bound with the demented person which leads too often to extreme interventions in the personals rights of the deme nted. By this, they fear that relatives might opt for a GPS locating device too quickly.  X  X elatives are much more anxi ous, which is clearly grounded in different forms of proximity and di stance to the demented than in our professional case. It is our job to guide them the right direction and to say  X  X ey, as a professional I can take the responsibility for that, and you shoul d accept that for you, too. X  X  (Int. Fr. W) In some cases the professional persons even see themselves as advocates for the demented. Especially in the early phases families feel shame for the disease and often try to  X  X ide X  the affected person from other people:  X  X ometimes the hair dresser is the first person who gets the information that there is some thing wrong with the husband, when she says  X  X  locked my husband at home because I do not know where he will be running. X  (Int Fr. U) For some of the interviewed relatives who care for their demented relatives at home the classic value trade-off described in literature between safety and autonomy is not of such a high relevance. In the light of the heavy burden and sorrow for their relatives, especially in progressed states of the illness and according to strong disorientation and their me ntal and personal  X  X limination X  the relieve of the relatives from the desperate sorrow in case that the demented gets lost is clearly standing in the foreground. The potential usage of a locating device is here predominantly seen as a possibility of relieve in a heavy situation. Having experienced a situation where the demented got lost, the wish for a support (be it technologically) rises:  X  X t is such a big panic. It is similar to when you lose your toddler in the city. You are petrified. X  (Int. Hr. B) The same comparison to the situation with a toddler one is completely responsible for is be ing drawn by another daughter of a demented in order to strengthen her argument that the fear of invading the demented person X  X  personality is of no relevance in this special situation with a demented person. Another daughter of a demented mother in an early stadium, but with changing states of disorien tation, regards this point from a very different point of view:  X  X or caring relatives such a system would help. It would provide mo re safety to the caregivers. X  (Int. Fr. S) Safety, in this case, means to her more inner peace of mind when her mother is going to the city on her own. For another daughter the case is similar: Her demented father walks several kilometers every day and his wife and the daughter often do not know where he is and if he is doing well. A locating system would be of great help especially for the mother w ho is mainly responsible for his care. Meanwhile, the family has established a  X  X amilial monitoring system X : The father of ten takes the same paths passing some of his siblings X  houses a nd sometimes takes a short rest there before running away again. Af ter his visit, his siblings call his wife for a short status report explaining that he has been there and in which direction he left. This case also shows another cat egory which is important in dementia treatment: His wife and daughter are permanently worried that something could happe n to him on his walk, e.g. to run into a car. However, they do not see a possibility to change the situation:  X  X e cannot hold him. X  (Int. Fr. C) This mirrors the often occurring helplessness of female relatives against their male demented, against their often occurring resoluteness and dominance. On the other hand, the care of demented wives often is easier for their husbands, as women are often more  X  X anageable X . This can be expl ained against the background of the family history and former familial distribution of roles. In such families where demented relatives are still allowed to leave the house on their own this often happens under direct attendance or clandestine observa tion by the relatives, who follow their demented or who integrate others in the observation, as previously reported.  X  With a GPS system there is more freedom for me, too X  a daughter of a demented mother says. She points at heavy qualms which she has when she clandestinely follows her mother to control where she is going to and if she is doing well:  X  X ith a GPS system I could tell her  X  X k, then go on your own when you feel cramped by me. X  But I would have the possibility to see what she does so that I could intervene in case of emergency and get active. X  (Int. Fr. S) Besides the emotional relief, she also values the freedom which could be given to the demented:  X  X his would be something which would give more freedom to both, the demented and the family relatives and all who are dealing with that. This looks like a good approach to the whole story. X  The aspect of freedom provided by a locating system also has anot her dimension in the daughter X  X  reflection. She sees in it the possibility to give a bit of autonomy back to her mother  X  or at least the possibility to give her the feeling of self-determination:  X  X  could give her the feeling of freedom back. I can let her go without saying that I want to acco mpany her, so that I could wait for her to propose  X  X hy don X  X  you join me? X  Or that I can offer it but do not have to go with her if she does not want me to. X  Here freedom involves the notion of giving a bit of responsibility and autonomy back so that she is able to make own decisions again. The demented would gain back a piece of control. The interviewee also draws the comparison to parenting, but from another perspective than before: Not in the sense of responsibility for a toddler but rather in the sense that in the adoption phase of a locating device the demented pe rson X  X  autonomy must be re-developed step by step and the da ughter has to give back control step by step herself:  X ...it is similar to how I did this with my children where I also said: I must give you the feeling of freedom which give you a frame for action. It is your freedom, but only up to certain points. For example, when I let her go to school on her own but then call a friend to ask if she passed their house. It means to give the child  X  or the pa tient  X  a feeling of freedom, but I need and have a certain security, though. X  The interviewee explains a fourth aspect of freedom insofar as when her mother has left her house she then is able to quickly clean the house. This is probl ematic when she is there:  X  X he benefit when mom is not there is that we then can clean things in her house then. For when she sees that we are wiping or so she always gets angry and asks us why we are doing her work. She thinks she is cleaning the house regularly on her own. But effectively she has not touched the cleaning cloth for more than one year. X  Here the daughter also responds to her mom X  X  imagination. It is the same patient-oriented interac tion principle as she would apply in the imagination of the potential profit of a GPS system. The daughter accepts and responds on the basis of her mother X  X  imagination and positions her activities around her mother X  X  imaginations in order to give her mom a feeling of control and autonomy. However, this action coul d also be an indicator for the wish of the daughter to keep her mother X  X  and her own  X  X ormality X  as long as possible by interacting with the imagination of the mother. Regarding this kind of interaction against the background of general coping strategies of adult children when parents age, often there happens a shift of roles. Children have to take over the pare nt role and need to  X  X row up X  and often feel overwhelmed with the new role. In case of the interviewee the reflection on the possible usage of a GPS systems seems to her to be able to go back to the role of the daughter for short-term. Likewise the caregivers need to observe the status of their demented relatives and patients constantly for deciding on how much freedom they can give th em without endangering them. An interviewee reflects on how she would start with the adoption of a locating system:  X  X  could let her go but the first times I would turn the system on and immediately would look where she is. Then, step by step, I would be calmer and then could see that she has a certain time frame until I expect her back. Then I would control the system less and less and only every now and then. X  Generally speaking, we must th ink about system functionalities which provide the option to contro l the patients as less as possible once a practice has been established. On the other hand, the timeframes need a re-evaluation when the disease progresses. The empirical study indicates that in the field of LBS support for the care of demented individuals, the trade-off between awareness and privacy needs to be reconsidered. In [16] and [17], from a medical research point of view another dilemma between safety and autonomy has been figured out as being the relevant stance in the context of dementia care. Here , autonomy is being regarded as an aspect of privacy for the special setting of dementia care. Our data shows that this relations hip can be regarded from two viewpoints and by this, changes the relation. That is why we see a shifting boundary in the reflection of this relationship: On one hand, an intrusion on the personal data (e.g. location privacy) can be regarded as a limitation of autonomy; on the other hand, a monitoring system provides the potential to strengthen the patients X  autonomy by giving them self-decisions on leaving the house when they want to or taking a walk on their own. This would be an activity-based persp ective from the perspective of the patients. To clarify these blurred boundaries of the concept  X  X utonomy X , it will be helpful to regard other concepts and phenomena which the interview ees subsume under the terms  X  X utonomy/privacy X . Firstly, we recognized that different ways of handling and interpreting autonomy aspects rela te to macro and micro level issues: How a caregiver positions himself/herself in the field of discourse is dependent on hi s or her personal knowledge on dementia care giving, and on the actual perceived load of burden. On a macro or societal level, by literature analysis and by means of the interview analyses certain societal  X  X rends X  in dealing with dementia can be figured out. We can resume that the disease still does not have a  X  X ublic face X  in Germany, despite of political and other campaigns, such as in othe r countries, e.g. the UK. Since 1996, there campaigns triggered by a study of [10] with the slogan  X  X earing the voice of people with dementia X  have brought forward immense results in societal and political work to bring interests and perspectives of demented to the stage. In interviews with families we l earned that here in Germany we are still quite far away from the institutionalization of innovative ways for the inclusion of demented persons. The same is true for accepting and valuing them with their certain perspectives and behaviors and looking more at thei r resources than deficits. We already got in touch with this certain societal wind in Germany when we had quite some trouble in finding family caregivers who were willing to talk to us. By means of help of the formerly mentioned self-help organization, we finally found our interview partners. But strikingly, we are still looking for demented persons in an early stadium who are willing and able to discuss with us on the technology development and re quirements from their point of view. We do not like only talking about demented persons, but at the moment we have no other chance. This is especially due to the handling of caregivers on the micro level of each family or subject which is influenced and framed by the societal trends. As dementia is often dealt w ith as a taboo with according consequences in Germany, affected persons and caregivers feel ashamed and it often takes quite a time until people visit a doctor and by this open them up to the system of several help offers. Linked to this is the fact that re latives start looking for help when the situation gets extreme or they are overwhelmed with the burden of care. A big problem with spouses is that due to the strong emotional bond and a lack of modern care concepts the caring person often come to a point of giving him/herself fully up and seeing no personal space for rest anymore and no one for the loved one, too. This has consequences for the potential usage of a system itself: on one hand for some family caregivers the potential benefit seems to be perfectly clear in a situation which has become a very desperate one. On the other hand, for people in early stadiums where the system could provide a real enhancement of personal freedom and safety, people are often not open to look for suchlike help systems. This is mirrored by the fact that similar systems are available on the market but only few people actually use such systems. Certainly, there are also other reasons for that: main caregivers of demented persons at home are elder people who have only low or no affinity to new media and ICT. Thus, this requires the system to be very simple in usage. In the attitudes of our interviewees towards the usage of GPS locating technologies for wandering persons we came to a kind of a paradox situation: On one hand, the tracking is standing in contrast to modern autonomy-orie nted dementia care conceptions. Here the argument is that tracking as an invasion in the personality of the demented impairs the autonomy. On the other hand, in some cases a GPS locating system is seen as fostering autonomy, e.g. when it helps that people can leave the nursing home, even despite a bad personnel s ituation. The same is true for home situations when interchange d parent-children roles may be switched back for a certain period of time and by this more wellbeing is being achieved for both, the demented and the caregiver. On a micro level, from the profe ssional care givers X  point of view one result is that autonomy is more a topic in management but not so much for the caregivers on the actual ward. Direct vs. indirect caregivers have different viewpoint s on the basis of their demands in their daily practice and by this, provide different concepts of thinking and dealing with autonomy. Linked concepts and phenomena which have been revealed in our study are:  X  Wellbeing and burden of the demented patients : The estimation of the degree of wellb eing and joy is one important criterion for the decision of how much autonomy is a patient given in the sense of a permission to leave the house on her/his own. The privacy question in the case of using an LBS solution is only a secondary concern here.  X  Severity of illness : The stadium of the illness and the degree of disorientation surprisingly are not the most important aspects which are being assessed for the decision whether a patient is allowed to leave the house. At least the indirect wellbeing/ X  X uality of life X  issue.  X  Responsibility of the caregiver : Responsibility is an aspect which is linked in different ways to the question of whether a patient is given more autonom y (to decide on his/her own to leave the house alone): Firstly, [16] found out differences in the feeling of the burden of responsibility for caregivers working in a nursing home or working in home care contexts. In nursing homes, the nurses feel more responsibility for the patients than in home care contexts as there the re sponsibility is shared with the relatives. Thus, the authors menti on a shift in the safety-autonomy dilemma: the nurses in nursing homes have a stronger focus on their patients X  safety while the home care nurses stress the importance of autonomy more. They are able to do so as they share the responsibility with the re latives at home. In our sample differentiation of direct caregivers and indirect, managing personnel. Here, it is the mana gers who all stress the point fostering the patients X  autonomy. This is based on different aspects. Firstly, it is based on other demands of their daily work, such as public relations. Second, it often is related to another educative background and state of the art knowledge of dementia care concepts.  X  Workload of the caregiver : Workload is the contradicting factor to the formerly said: Even though a nursing home is based on new patient-oriented care concepts, the actual workload of the nurses hinders to respond to patients X  wishes to go outside the house.  X  Communicative strategies/public relations : our study has revealed that an attempt to provide  X  X olitical correctness X  is strongly linked to the reflection of the patients X  autonomy and their privacy. But in the interviews it is twofold: firstly, autonomy is equalized with privacy when managers are afraid that they might not act legally in terms of data privacy issues. On the other hand there is the aspect of political correctness on the basis of the adoption of new dementia care paradigms: in this regard, the system could give the demented more autonomy in the sense of freedom of own decisions, more humanity and quality of life.  X  Legal aspects : the formerly mentioned aspect is strongly linked to legal issues and it is the same twofold point of view: it is privacy in the sense of data protection on one hand and the patient X  X  autonomy in the sense of the right of self-determination, self-reliance a nd humanity on the other. Some interviewees related their persp ectives to the fundamental law which says in its first paragr aph:  X  X he dignity of man is inviolable. X  Both perspectives, the data protection and the self-determination perspective, are dir ectly linked to this law. This means a decision must be made in every individual case on what is the higher good in the special cas e. The interviews revealed a general and high incertitude toward s legal aspects of monitoring demented persons. That is why th e interview partners looked for other decision criterions to assure their points of view towards LBS. The bandwidth of concepts and attitudes towards questions of autonomy and privacy from the family caregivers X  points of view is similar to the formerly mentioned aspects. However, there are some significant differences:  X  Legal aspects do not play a significant role as the relatives often have the tutelage on their demented relatives and as such have the right to decide on the question whether an LBS system would help to increase th e patient X  X  safety/autonomy. In this regard, it is more important to reflect the relatives X  concepts and thoughts on autonomy itself:  X  Individual burden : the individually perceived burden and the linked emotional bonds influence the relatives X  perspectives on how to deal with their patients X  safety or autonomy: The bandwidth in our interviewed families is from the point that questions of autonomy are of no relevance up to the perceived stress of autonomy or retu rn of control in the demented mother X  X  hand. Safety is a bi g issue and concern of family caregivers but it is also dealt with differently: from the practice of not letting a demented person out of sight  X  even not inside his/her own house up to the feeling of fear and helplessness when demented persons leave for walks and cannot be held back by the  X  often  X  female spouses or child ren. Others find intermediate ways along a line of signaling aut onomy but fabricating safety at the same time, when for example clandestinely following the demented on their walk.  X  Gender : Gender aspects often influence the way people deal with their relatives X  demen tia. Especially wives often are more  X  X olerant X  when their deme nted husbands attempt to wander outside the house. This is often due to traditional family roles and linked to a perceived inability to hold their more dominant wandering husbands back. In c ontrast, husbands often find it easier to establish a safe envir onment for their demented wives, but nevertheless the fear of th em  X  X scaping X  from the house and getting lost is high, too. Regard ing the handling of autonomy this means that often incapability leads to give a rather unintended freedom on one hand, and on the othe r, autonomy is not a relevant aspect from the husbands point of view. This aspect is linked to the next issue, which is:  X  Relationships between pr ofessional caregivers and relatives : Here the view onto autonomy is somewhat twofold. On one hand, in homecare settings, the relatives carry the highest burden and responsibility for their demented. The relatives also are important for decision maki ng processes when the patients live in nursing homes. On the other hand, some professional caregivers see the need to bring training of new dementia care concepts to the relatives. They fi nd it important as in some cases they perceive that relatives do not acknowledge their demented relatives X  autonomy rights and needs.  X  Another important structuring aspect is the difference in being a spouse or a child of a demented person : Due to the problematic of a shift in roles children often are more aware of autonomy issues of their parents as they feel bad when starting to control or to lie at their parent s. In our sample, daughters wished to intensify humanity for their deme nted parents, e.g. by using a LBS for giving a piece of control and self-determination back. Despite the limited size of our samp le we could demonstrate that in LBS research for dementia care we need to open up common concepts of privacy/awareness and dilemma in the medical literature on  X  X afety-autonomy X  and base related technology development on more practice-ba sed attitudes and insights, as given in this study. The concepts  X  X rivacy X  and  X  X utonomy X  are socially embedded in various wa ys and links from the viewpoint of the caregivers. In addition, they are influenced by macro-level, societal trends. Technologically speaking, it has become clear that a system should in its functionalities react upon various contexts, strategies, and conditions of i ndividual ways of coping with a patient X  X  or a relative X  X  disease. For example, in LBS it is state of the art to draw a security area on a map. When a person leaves the area, an alarm is sent to the caregiver. What we see from the interviews is that we must reflect upon how to better support varying user needs in the realm of providing autonomy, e.g. in tailoring more fine-grained scal es of autonomy provision, and which may be easily adapted to the actual and daily status of the demented. In support for that, a system should be customizable not only to the direct users (caregivers who track), but also to those indirect users (patients who are tracked). Here are some examples: A customizable radius of masking area provides the flexibility to switch towards safety or privacy. The frequency of tracking, i.e. how many GPS positi on reports should be sent back to the server in a certain time interval, can be a personalized factor as well. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to have personal time plans. Tailoring the time plans should also take the patients X  habits into considera tion, as regularity of patients X  wandering has been notified in our interviews. Finally, historical logging and its level of detail s hould be customizable as well. Such history of data might pr ovide with novel implications on wandering behavior. Almost all the interviewees told us that patients always have their favorite wandering routes. These routes can be the way home, or a personally favorite path. Interestingly, there is some inconsistence be tween what the patients say and what the patients do. They may say that they like to walk in certain routes, but in practice it could be totally different. These findings show that, firstly, the data of history path is very helpful for the caregivers to find a wandering patient. Secondly, this data should be based on a long-term sta tistical summary with the help of a system. Supporting collaborative care is another critical issue which needs to be integrated in a localization application for demented. For many caring activities, the search for a lost patient happens in a collaborative manner as well. This is true for institutions of elder care but also for family care settings. This implies that the formerly clear job responsibilities will probably be reconsidered in the course of the technology development, implementation and appropriation. In family settings , loosely-coupled help systems will be changing into more fixed roles and responsibilities when adopting LBS for common care. These changing organizational patterns point at the need for an action research-based user-centered design approach in the following steps to successively co-develop the technology and changing practices. Especially for collaborative retrieving situations when a wandering person is lost, a collaboration support will be of great help. Lack of communication could result in low efficiency and low accuracy in finding. This empirical finding indicates a need to better understand and support collaborative activities in search for lost dementia patients. Overall, measures of coping and caring for a demented need constant reflection, evaluation and, if needed, adaptation. The same will be true when it is made use of an LBS system. We studied how family and prof essional caregivers cope with demented relatives or patients, respectively, and especially with wandering behavior which is of ten a challenging burden for all actors involved. From the analysis of 21 interviews with caregivers at home and in nursing homes in Germany, we contribute to research on social issues in the realm of the development, acceptance, adoption and use of LBS in dementia care. We took notice of concepts for addressing social issues in general LBS research  X  i.e. awareness and privacy  X  and concepts stressed in the medical literature as being the caregivers X  core concerns when reflecting the us e of monitoring systems for the prevention of wandering  X  i.e. au tonomy and safety. Our findings show that these common dilemmas exis in a blured state as seen from the practice-based qualitative data. The study contributes with empirically-grounded aspect s of the social embedding of practices and attitudes towards privacy and autonomy in dementia care. It also reveals some technical implications for the development of LBS in this domain. .
