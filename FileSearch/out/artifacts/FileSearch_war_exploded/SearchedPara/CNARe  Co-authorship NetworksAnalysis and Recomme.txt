 We present CNARe, an easy-to-use online system that shows personalized collaboration recommendations to researchers. It also provides visualizations and metrics that allow to in-vestigate how the recommendations affect a co-authorship social network and other analyses.
 H.4 [ Information Systems Applications ]: Miscellaneous Social Network Analysis; Co-authorship Recommendation
In science, usually, research is done through collabora-tion. However, searching for collaborators (other researchers to work with) is not an easy task and has become an im-portant obstacle to many researchers. The intense concern with innovation and productivity is one main reason for such phenomenon. Indeed, Lopes et al. [3] show that produc-tive researchers are more inclined to collaborating, and pro-lific research groups have better connected academic social networks (given by researchers and their co-authorships). Other examples include finding people to work with in a new institution and to participate in collaborative grant propos-als. Then, the recommendation of collaborators is key to in-crease the interactions among researchers and, consequently, to rise their productivity and research quality.

Driven by such motivation, there are recent advances in proposing collaboration recommendation algorithms [1, 2, 4]. Each algorithm recommends collaborators using differ-ent strategies, such as network topological analysis, seman-tic of the relationship between researchers, and mathemati-cal formalization. In general, such algorithms consider the co-authorship among researchers to capture their collabo-rations. These relationships can be found in co-authorship social networks, a specific type of social network (SN) where the nodes are researchers and edges represent their connec-tions through publication authorships.
 Here, we propose an online tool called CNARe 1 ( scenery ). It provides better ways to help researchers in: choosing collaborators, visualizing recommendations, and contrasting results given by different recommendation algorithms. So far, we focus on three recommendation algorithms that com-bine topological properties of co-authorship social networks and academic metrics: Affin [1] considers the shortest path between researchers and the researchers X  institutional affili-ation; CORALS [2] combines the shortest path between re-searchers and their research area; and MVCWalker [4] uses a random walk model with three academic metrics (co-author order, latest collaboration time, and number of collabora-tion). Another unique feature is to show how the recom-mended collaborations may impact a co-authorship network. Finally, CNARe provides different visualizations that allow important social networks analyses.
A brief overview of CNARe X  X  main components on both backend and frontend is illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically at the backend, CNARe stores sets of researchers X  publica-tions in a SQL database (see CNARe X  X  webpage for infor-mation on its database modeling). The database is initially populated with publications from Computer Science. Users
CNARe information webpage: http://goo.gl/rn5lud may also upload other sets of researchers and their publi-cations. Then, CNARe uses such publications to generate co-authorship social networks (which will also be stored in the database). In turn, at the frontend, users benefit from three major features: recommendations, visualizations with filters, and social networks metrics analyzes. It is important to note that the last two features aim to improve the presen-tation and understanding of the recommendations. Finally, on the online interface, users may also insert a co-authorship SN through comma separated values files, edit researchers X  information, and edit the research area of a researcher.
The main features of CNARe are summarized in Figure 2. Some of them are for specific researchers, i.e. a user must choose a researcher before accessing them. Different rectangle line styles indicate whether it is necessary to select a researcher (continuous line) or not (dashed line). Next, we detail each of the main features.
 Recommendations of collaborators. CNARe provides a researcher search interface. By selecting a researcher, the user is able to compare the top-5 recommendations given by the algorithms. Specifically, the comparison is done through pairs (i.e., three combinations: Affin and CORALS , Affin and MVCWalker , CORALS and MVCWalker ). Besides the resulting recommendations of collaborators, the tool presents their institution and research areas, which allows the user to know a little bit more about the researcher. There are also other pages showing the recommendations, and they differ by the visualizations of the social networks and recommen-dations, quantity of researchers, and SN metrics.
 Visualizations and filters. CNARe provides two main visualizations: co-authorship ego-networks and global co-authorship networks. The ego-networks focus on a researcher and show his/her direct co-authorships, with current col-laborations and the recommended ones. The global co-authorship networks show all co-authorships from an insti-tution, a researcher (the co-authors of the researcher X  X  co-authors), or an uploaded network. Such global SNs provide a general view of the co-authorships, and allow to better analyze the context of the ego-networks. For example, a user can see the global co-authorship social network of an institution of a recommended researcher.

In order to personalize the visualizations, there are four fil-ters that can be applied to the co-authorships. They are: ( i ) by institution, showing only the links of co-authors from the selected institution; ( ii ) the last time of co-authorship, by focusing on the co-authorships within a period of years (for example, last 2 years); ( iii ) the frequency of co-authorship, presenting the links between researchers that publish to-gether a selected number of times (for instance, 2 to 5 pub-lications in common); and ( iv ) the date of the last academic formation, allowing to consider researchers from similar aca-demic  X  X eneration X . This last one is important to filter, for example, researchers who have retired or are too young. Social networks metrics. CNARe also shows social net-works metrics. Considering the ego-networks, it is hard to find relevant metrics, because such networks are relatively small, with not enough information. Thus, for such net-works, CNARe applies neighborhood overlap, clustering co-efficient, and affiliation homophily. Specifically, the neigh-borhood overlap presents the strength of the recommended link, which allows to analyze if the recommend link will be a bridge (i.e., an edge responsible for linking different and unconnected communities) or not. The other metrics show how the recommendations affect the networks. CNARe also presents statistics of the global co-authorship social network. For instance, the number of authors, number of links, fre-quency of co-authorship, and so on.
We presented CNARe, a friendly online tool for contrast-ing the collaboration recommendations of three different al-gorithms. It also uses visualizations and SN metrics to show how the recommendations change a researcher ego-network. Besides, the visualizations present how new recom-mended links can work as bridges to another researchers X  co-authorship network. All such visualizations represent a step forward in recommending collaboration tools, which have focused on the recommendation algorithms rather than vi-sualizing their results. As future steps, we plan to integrate more recommendations algorithms and SN metrics.
