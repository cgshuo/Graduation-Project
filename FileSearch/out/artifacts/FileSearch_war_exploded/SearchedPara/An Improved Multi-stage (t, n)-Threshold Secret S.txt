 pants. It plays an important role in protecting important information from being lost, destroyed, modified, or into wrong hands. Secret sharing has been an important branch of modern cryptography [1], [2]. A secret sharing scheme mainly includes a pair of algorithms [3]: a secret-distrib ution algorithm and a secret-reconstruction algorithm. A trusted dealer (secret holder) computes n shadows (also called sub-scheme is the ( t , n )-threshold scheme, which was introduced by Shamir [4] and Blak-trusted dealer divides a secret into n shadows, and then he distributes these shadows secret, but ( t  X  1) or fewer participants can obtain nothing about the secret. 
There are mainly two categories of secret sharing schemes according to the order of secret reconstruction, the general secret sharing scheme and the multi-stage secret sharing scheme. In the former, the secret reconstruction can be executed in any order, such as schemes [6], [7], [8]. In the latter, the secret reconstruction must be executed in a predefined order, such as [9], [10], [1 1]. In the real world applications, the multi-stage secret sharing is very practical. For example [11], there may be a security sys-tem of bank X  X  confidential database where one must pass through k checkpoints be-points (secrets) do not follow the proper order, it will harm the security of the system. So it is very significant to study the multi-stage secret sharing. 
In 1994, He and Dawson [9] proposed a multi-stage ( t , n )-threshold secret sharing scheme to share multiple secrets based on the one-way function. They used the public shift technique to obtain each participant X  X  true shadow and the successive application of a one-way function to make secrets reconstructed stage-by-stage in a special order. Later, Harn [10] proposed an alternative scheme, which has the same capability as He fresh shadows to every participant. Then they proposed a new multi-stage ( t , n )-threshold scheme [11] based on the one-way function. They claimed that their scheme belongs to the multi-use scheme [12], that is to say, when some particular secrets have every participant, and each participant n eeds to keep only one shadow. However, Chang et al . X  X  scheme used kn public values to share k secrets. The number of public values is one of the important parameters that determine the performance of a scheme, because it affects the storage and communicatio n complexity of the scheme [7], [13]. Therefore, the large number of the public values may affect the performance of Chang et al . X  X  scheme. Motivated by these concerns, we made an improvement on Chang et The proposed scheme has the same merits as Chang et al . X  X  scheme. What X  X  more, for needed in our scheme, which are fewer than that in Chang et al . X  X  scheme. Our scheme becomes very attractive, especially when the threshold value t is very close to the number of participants n . The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we shall briefly review the proposed scheme. Finally, we shall give conclusions in Section 5. function [9], which will be also used in the proposed scheme. Definition 1 (One-way function). Let GF ( p ) denote a finite field , and let f k &gt; 0 . 
Now we review Chang et al . X  X  scheme briefly, and for more details, readers may known to everyone. And at least t participants can easily reconstruct these secrets by distribution: (2) Construct a polynomial P k ( x ) of degree ( t  X  1) and P k (0) = s k . (4) For i = k  X  1, k  X  2, ... , 1, execute the following steps: a) Construct a polynomial P i ( x ) of degree ( t  X  1) and P i (0) = s i . b) For j =1, 2, ... , n , compute Z i , j = P i ( x j ). the following formula: 
Then they have to provide their other ps eudo shadows in the following special or-the following formula (for i = k  X  1, k  X  2, ... , 1): scheme that is an improvement on Chang et al . X  X  scheme [11]. Our scheme needs fewer public values than Chang et al . X  X  scheme. The proposed scheme concludes four parts: (1) system parameters, (2) secret dist ribution, (3) secret reconstruction and (4) cheater identification. The details of four parts are as follows: 3.1 System Parameters The proposed scheme works over a finite field GF ( p ), where p is a large prime num-D ( D  X  U ) denotes a dealer. In the whole paper, we assume that the dealer is a trusted 2, ... , n , as participants X  public identifiers and n random integers, y tion. 3.2 Secret Distribution The dealer executes the following steps to implement the secret distribution: (2) For j =1, 2, ... , n  X  t + 1, Compute the public value Z k , j = P k ( j ). (3) For i = k  X  1, k  X  2, ... , 1, execute the following steps: a) Construct an n th degree Lagrange interpolation polynomial P i ( x ), which 3.3 Secret Reconstruction s P respectively. Then the secret s k can be reconstructed through the following formula: 
In order to recover the remaining secrets, these t participants have to provide their ( x ... can be reconstructed via the following formula (for i = k  X  1, k  X  2, ... , 1): 3.4 Cheater Identification and identify the cheater, and there are already lots of works on this issue. These meth-ods can be employed in the proposed scheme directly. Readers may refer to works in order to keep participants X  real shadows secr et after the cheater identification process, able to use the pseudo shadow f j ( y i ) to determine whether there exists a cheater with-out knowing the real shadow y i . Hence, each participant U i just pools his/her pseudo not be disclosed by the properties of the one-way function. In this section, we will prove that our scheme is a real multi-use scheme and that the secrets are constructed stage-by-stage, and then, we shall analyze the performance and security of our scheme. 4.1 Multi-use Scheme 2, ... , t ) still stay un-disclosed. To share the next secret, the dealer only needs to pub-our scheme, each participant U i needs to keep only one secret shadow y i . 4.2 Multi-stage Feature Since a secret s k can only be solved by Equation (3), at least t participants must pro-say, without knowing the secret s i , it is computationally impossible to recover the next secret s i  X  1 . 4.3 Performance Analysis two aspects: public values and computational complexity. (1) Public Value 
The number of public values is one of the important parameters that determine the performance of a scheme, because it affects the storage and communication complex-sharing k secrets. However, in the proposed scheme, for each sharing secret, it is re-where t  X  1. The proposed scheme becomes more attractive, especially when the Chang et al . X  X  scheme needs kn public values to share k secrets, while only a total of k public values are required to share k secrets in the proposed scheme. (2) Computational Complexity the polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which is the same as Chang et al . X  X  using these algorithms, the efficiency of our scheme will be improved greatly. There-fore, the proposed scheme is very efficient and easy to implement. 4.4 Security Analysis more participants pool their secret shadows and easily reconstruct the secret, but only ( t  X  1) or fewer secret shadows will not be enough. Knowing only ( t  X  1) or fewer secret shadows provides no more information about the secret to an opponent than knowing no pieces. In the following, several possible attacks will be raised and fought against to demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme. 
Attack 1: A participant U i tries to reveal other participant X  secret shadow y j , where 1  X  j  X  n and j  X  i . 
Analysis of Attack 1: When the last secret has been reconstructed, every participant However, no one can obtain the true shadow y j from f ( y j ) under the protection of the one-way function f . j  X  n and j  X  i ) that is not published.

Analysis of Attack 2: In our scheme, the secrets are reconstructed in the order of s k , s tion f . 
Attack 3: t participants try to disintegrate the order by the dealer X  X  determination to reconstruct the secrets. 
Analysis of Attack 3: From the Equation (4), to reconstruct the secret s i , they should scheme. stage and multi-use scheme, and needs fewer public values than Chang et al . X  X  scheme, so it is higher in efficiency than Chang et al . X  X  scheme is. We made an improvement on Chang et al . X  X  scheme, and proposed a new multi-stage ( t , n )-threshold secret sharing scheme. In the proposed scheme, each participant needs to keep only one secret shadow in sharing multiple secrets without updating each participant X  X  secret shadow, and the proposed scheme is a real multi-use and multi-stage scheme and easy to implement. Our scheme needs fewer public values than Chang et al . X  X  scheme, and the implementation of our scheme becomes more attrac-tive, especially when the threshold t is very close to the number of the participants n . Analyses show that the proposed scheme is a computationally secure and efficient scheme and that it provides great capabilities for many applications.
