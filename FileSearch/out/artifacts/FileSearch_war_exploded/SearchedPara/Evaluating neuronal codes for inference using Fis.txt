 Understanding how the brain performs statistical inference is one of the main problems of theoreti-cal neuroscience. In this paper, we propose to apply the tools developed to evaluate the information content of neuronal codes corrupted by noise to address the question of how well they support sta-tistical inference. At the core of our approach lies the interpretation of neuronal response variability due to nuisance stimulus variability as noise.
 Many theoretical and experimental studies have probed the impact of intrinsic response variability on the quality of sensory codes ([1, 12] and references therein). However, most neurons are responsive brain needs to be able to ignore the effect of confounding attributes that also influence the neuron X  X  response. We propose to evaluate the usefulness of a population code for inference over a particular parameter by treating the neuronal response variability due to nuisance stimulus attributes as noise equivalent to intrinsic noise (e.g. Poisson spiking).
 We explore the implications of this new approach for the model system of stereo vision where the inference task is to extract depth from binocular images. We compute the Fisher information present Figure 1: Left: Example random dot stereogram (RDS). Right: Illustration of bincular energy model without (top) and with (bottom) phase disparity. in the monocular inputs to the standard model of early binocular processing and thereby obtain an upper bound on how precisely a model could theoretically extract depth. We compare this with the amount of information that remains after early visual processing. We distinguish the two principal model flavors that have been proposed to explain the physiological findings. We find that one of the two models appears superior to the other one for inferring depth.
 We start by giving a brief introduction to the two principal flavors of the binocular energy model. We then retrace the processing steps and compute the Fisher information with respect to depth inference that is present: first in the monocular inputs, then after binocular combination, and finally for the resulting tuning curves. Stereo vision has the advantage of a clear separation between the relevant stimulus dimension  X  binocular disparity  X  and the confounding or nuisance stimulus attributes  X  monocular image struc-ture ([9]). The challenge in inferring disparity in image pairs consists in distinguishing true from false matches, regardless of the monocular structures in the two images. The stimulus that tests this system in the most general way are random dot stereograms (RDS) that consist of nearly identical dot patterns in either eye (see Figure 1). The fact that parts of the images are displaced horizontally with respect to each other has been shown to be sufficient to give rise to a sensation of depth in humans and monkeys ([5, 4]). Since RDS do not contain any monocular depth cues (e.g. size or perspective) the brain needs to correctly match the monocular image features across eyes to compute disparity.
 The standard model for binocular processing in primary visual cortex (V1) is the binocular energy model ([5, 10]). It explains the response of disparity-selective V1 neurons by linearly combining the output of monocular simple cells and passing the sum through a squaring nonlinearity (illustrated in Figure 1). where  X  e L is the output of an even-symmetric receptive field (RF) applied to the left image,  X  o R is the output of an odd-symmetric receptive field (RF) applied to the right image, etc. By pairing  X  sin 2 + cos 2 = 1 ) and the binocular part is modulated only by the difference (or disparity) between the phases in left and right grating  X  as observed for complex cells in V1. The disparity tuning curve resulting from the combination in equation (1) is even-symmetric (illustrated in Figure 1 in blue) and is one of two primary types of tuning curves found in cortex ([5]). In order to model the other, odd-symmetric type of tuning curves (Figure 1 in red), the filter outputs are combined such that the output of an even-symmetric filter is always combined with that of an odd-symmetric one in the other eye: Note that the two models are identical in their monocular inputs and the monocular part of their output (the first four terms in equations 1 and 2) and only vary in their binocular interaction terms (in brackets). The only way in which the first model can implement preferred disparities other than disparity tuning curve achieves its maximum when the disparity in the image matches the disparity between the RFs). The second model, on the other hand achieves non-zero preferred disparities by employing a phase shift between the left and right RF (90 deg in our case). It is therefore considered to be phase-disparity model, while the first one is called a position disparity one. 2 How much information the response of a neuron carries about a particular stimulus attribute depends both on the sensitivity of the response to changes in that attribute and to the variability (or uncer-tainty) in the response across all stimuli while keeping that attribute fixed. Fisher information is the standard way to quantify this intuition in the context of intrinsic noise ([6], but also see [2]) and we will use it to evaluate the binocular energy model mechanisms with regard to their ability to extract the disparity information contained in the monocular inputs arriving at the eyes. 3.1 Response variability Figure 2 shows the mean of the binocular response of the two models.
 The variation of the response around the mean due to the variation in monocular image structure in the RDS is shown in Figure 3 (top row) for four exemplary disparities:  X  1 , 0 , 1 and uncorrelated (  X  X  ), indi-cated in Figure 2. Unlike in the commonly assumed case of intrinsic noise, p binoc ( r | d )  X  the stimulus-conditioned response distribution  X  is far from Poisson or Gaussian. Interestingly, its mode is always at zero  X  the average response to uncorrelated stimuli  X  and the fact that the mean depends on the stimulus disparity is primarily due to the disparity-dependence of the skew of the response distribution (Figure 3). 3 The skew in turn depends on the disparity through the disparity-dependent correlation between the RF outputs as illustrated in Figure 3 (bottom row). Of particular interest are the response distributions at the zero disparity 4 , the disparities at which r odd takes its minimum and maximum, respectively, and the uncorrelated case (infinite disparity). In the case of infinite disparity, the images in the two eyes are completely independent of each other and hence the outputs of the left and right RFs are independent Gaussians. Therefore,  X  L  X  R  X  p binoc ( r | d =  X  ) is symmetric around 0. In the case of zero disparity (identical images in left and right eye), the correlation is 1 between the outputs of left and right RFs (both even, or both odd). It follows that  X  L  X  R  X   X  2 1 and hence has a mean of 1. What is also apparent is that the binocular energy model with phase disparity (where each even-symmetric RF is paired with an odd-symmetric one) never achieves perfect correlation between the left and right eye and only covers smaller values. 3.2 Fisher information 3.2.1 Fisher information contained in monocular inputs First, we quantify the information contained in the inputs to the energy model by using Fisher in-formation. Consider the 4D space spanned by the outputs of the four RFs in left and right eye: (  X  Figure 3: Response distributions p ( r | d ) for varying d . Top row: histograms for values of interaction terms  X  e L  X  e R (blue) and  X  e L  X  o R (red). Bottom row: distribution of corresponding RF outputs  X  L vs  X  to the model with even-symmetric tuning curve and odd-symmetric tuning curve, respectively. The disparity value for each column is  X  X  ,  X  1 , 0 and 1 corresponding to those highlighted in Figure 2. monocular inputs do not depend on the stimulus and hence, the Fisher information is given by I ( d ) = 1 functions 6 since Gabors functions have been shown to provide a good fit to the range of RF shapes and disparity tuning curves that are empirically observed in early sensory cortex ([5]). 7 a ( d ) and c ( d ) are illustrated by the blue and red curves in Figure 2, respectively. Because the binocular part of the energy model response, or disparity tuning curve, is the convolution of the left and right RFs, the phase of the Gabor describing the disparity tuning curve is given by the difference between the phases of the corresponding RFs. Therefore c ( d ) is odd-symmetric and c (  X  d ) =  X  c ( d ) . We obtain where we omitted the stimulus dependence of a ( d ) and c ( d ) for clarity of exposition and where 0 denotes the 1st derivative with respect to the stimulus d . The denominator of equation (3)) is given by det C and corresponds to the Gaussian envelope of the Gabor functions for a ( d ) and c ( d ) : In Figure 4B (black) we plot the Fisher information as a function of disparity. We find that the Fisher information available in the inputs diverges at zero disparity (at the difference between the centers of the left and right RFs in general). This means that the ability to discriminate zero disparity from Figure 4: A : Disparity tuning curves for the model using position disparity (even) and phase disparity (odd) in blue and red, respectively. B : Black: Fisher information contained in the monocular inputs. Blue: Fisher information left after combining inputs from left and right eye according to position disparity model. Red: Fisher information after combining inputs using phase disparity model. Note that the black and red curves diverge at zero disparity. C : Fisher information for the final model output/neuronal response. Same color code as previously. Solid lines correspond to complex, dashed lines to simple cells. D : Same as C but with added Gaussian noise in the monocular inputs. nearby disparities is arbitrarily good. In reality, intrinsic neuronal variability will limit the Fisher information at zero. 8 3.2.2 Combination of left and right inputs Next we analyze the information that remains after linearly combining the monocular inputs in the energy model. It follows that the 4-dimensional monocular input space is reduced to a 2-dimensional Again, the marginal distributions are Gaussians with zero mean independent of stimulus disparity. This means that we can compute the Fisher information for the position disparity model from the covariance matrix C as above: The dependence of Fisher information on d is shown in Figure 4B (blue). The total information (as measured by integrating Fisher information over all disparities) communicated by the position-disparity model is greatly reduced compared to the total Fisher information present in the inputs. a ( d ) is an even-symmetric Gabor (illustrated in Figure 2) and hence the Fisher information is great-est on either side of the maximum where the slopes of a ( d ) are steepest, and zero at the center where a ( d ) has its peak. We note here that the Fisher information for the final tuning curve for the position-disparity model is the same as in equation (4) and therefore we will postpone a more detailed discussion of it until section 3.2.3. On the other hand, when combining the monocular inputs according to the phase disparity model, we find: follows as I odd ( d ) is shown in Figure 4B (red). While loosing 50% of the Fisher information present in the inputs, the Fisher information after combining left and right RF outputs is much larger in this case than for the position disparity model explored above. How can that be? Why are the two ways of combining the monocular outputs not symmetric? Insight into this question can be gained by looking at the binocular interaction terms in the quadratic expansion of the feature space for the two models. 9 Here, all three dimensions are linearly independent (although correlated), each contributing to the Fisher information. This can also explain why I odd ( d ) is symmetric around zero, and independent of the Gabor phase of c ( d ) . While this is not a rigorous analysis yet of the differences between the models at the stage of binocular combination, it serves as a starting point for a future investigation. 3.2.3 Disparity tuning curves In order to collapse the 2-dimensional binocular inputs into a scalar output that can be coded in the spike rate of a neuron, the energy model postulates a squaring output nonlinearity after each linear combination and summing the results. Since the (  X  L +  X  R ) 2 are not Normally distributed and their means depend on the stimulus disparity, we cannot employ the above approach to calculate Fisher information but instead use the more general where p ( r ; d ) is the response distribution for stimulus disparity d . Because the  X  are drawn from a follows for the model with an even-symmetric tuning function that where H ( r ) is the Heaviside step function. 10 Substituting equation (6) into equation (5) we find 11 Remarkably, this is exactly the same amount of information that is available after summing left and right RFs (see equation 4), so none is lost after squaring and combining the quadrature pair. We show I from the Fisher information based on the Poisson noise model (and ignoring stimulus variability as considered here) only by the exponent of 2 in the denominator. Since 1 + a ( d )  X  0 this means that the qualitative dependence of I on d is the same, the main difference being that the Fisher information favors small over large spike rates even more. Conversely, it follows that when Fisher information only takes the neuronal noise into consideration, it greatly overestimates the information that the neuron carries with respect to the to-be-inferred stimulus parameter for realistic spike counts (of greater than two). Furthermore, unlike in the Poisson case, a scaling up of the tuning function stimulus variability as considered here is invariant to the absolute height of the tuning curve. 12 and  X  o L +  X  e R have different variances depending on d , and are usually not independent of each other, the sum cannot be modeled by a  X  2  X  distribution. However, we can compute the Fisher information for the two implied binocular simple cells instead. 13 It follows that odd ( d ) =
The dependence of I simple odd on disparity is shown in Figure 4C (red dashed). Most of the Fisher information is located in the primary slope (compare Figure 4A) followed by secondary slope to its left. The reason for this is the strong boost Fisher information gets when responses are lowest. We also see that the total Fisher information carried by a phase-disparity simple cell is significantly raising the question of what other advantages or trade-offs there are that make it beneficial for the primate brain to employ so many position-disparity ones. Intrinsic neuronal variability may provide intrinsic variability increases. Figure 4D shows the Fisher information after Gaussian noise has been added to the monocular inputs. However, even in this high intrinsic noise regime (noise variance of the same order as tuning curve amplitude) the model with phase disparity carries significantly more total Fisher information. The central idea of our paper is to evaluate the quality of a sensory code with respect to an inference task by taking stimulus variability into account, in particular that induced by irrelevant stimulus attributes. By framing stimulus-induced nuisance variability as noise, we were able to employ the existing framework of Fisher information for evaluating the standard model of early binocular pro-cessing with respect to inferring disparity from random dot stereograms.
 We started by investigating the disparity-conditioned variability of the binocular response in the ab-sence of intrinsic neuronal noise. We found that the response distributions are far from Poisson or Gaussian and  X  independent of stimulus disparity  X  are always peaked at zero (the mean response to uncorrelated images). The information contained in the correlations between left and right RF outputs are translated into a modulation of the neuron X  X  mean firing rate primarily by altering the skew of the response distribution. This is quite different from the case of intrinsic noise and has implications for comparing different codes. It is noteworthy that these response distributions are entirely imposed by the sensory system  X  the combination of the structure of the external world with the internal processing model. Unlike the case of intrinsic noise which is usually added ad-hoc after the neuronal computation has been performed, in our case the computational model impacts the use-fulness of the code beyond the traditionally reported tuning functions. This property extends to the case of population codes, the next step for future work. Of great importance for the performance of population codes are interneuronal correlations. Again, the noise correlations due to nuisance stim-ulus parameters are a direct consequence of the processing model and the structure of the external input.
 Next we compared the Fisher information available for our inference task at various stages of binoc-ular processing. We computed the Fisher information available in the monocular inputs to binocular neurons in V1, after binocular combination and after the squaring nonlinearity required to translate binocular correlations into mean firing rate modulation. We find that despite the great stimulus vari-ability, the total Fisher information available in the inputs diverges and is only bounded by intrinsic neuronal variability. The same is still true after binocular combination for one flavor of the model considered here  X  that employing phase disparity (or pairing unlike RFs in either eye), not the other one (position disparity), which has lost most information after the initial combination. At this point, our new approach allows us to ask a normative question: In what way should the monocular inputs be combined so as to lose a minimal amount of information about the relevant stimulus dimension? Is the combination proposed by the standard model to obtain even-symmetric tuning curves the only one to do so or are they others that produce a different tuning curve, with a different response dis-tribution that is more suited to inferring depth? Conversely, we can compare our results for the model stages leading from simple to complex cells and compare them with the corresponding Fisher information computed from empirically observed distributions, to test our model assumptions. Recently, Fisher information has been criticized as a tool for comparing population codes ([3, 2]). their framework of neurometric function analysis to compare the performance of different codes in a disparity discrimination task.
 Another potentially promising avenue of future research would to investigate the effect of thresh-olding on inference performance. One reason that odd-symmetric tuning curves had higher Fisher information in the case we investigated was that odd-symmetric cells produce near-zero responses more often in the context of the energy model. However, it is known from empirical observations that fitting even-symmetric disparity tuning curves requires an additional thresholding output non-linearity. It is unclear at this point to what extend such a change to the response distribution helps or hinders inference.
 And finally, we suggest that considering the different shapes of response distributions induced by the specifics of the sensory modality might have an impact on the discussion about probabilistic population codes ([7, 8] and references therein). Cue-integration, for instance, has usually been studied under the assumption of Poisson-like response distributions, assumptions that do not appear to hold in the case of combining disparity cues from different parts of the visual field.
