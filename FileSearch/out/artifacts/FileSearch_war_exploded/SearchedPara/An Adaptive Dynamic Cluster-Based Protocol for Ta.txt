 wireless communication technologies, tiny sensor nodes can be densely deployed in the battle fields or the urban areas to form a large-scale wireless sensor network. Hun-networks makes tracking with wireless sensor networks having several advantages: (1) contains redundancy, which can be used to increase the accuracy of tracking. However challenges and difficulties also exist in target tracking sensor networks: (1) the sensor usually sustained by battery which cannot be changed during its lifetime so the limit of active mode (2) the sensor nodes are prone to failure because of lack of power, physi-cal damage or environment interference. So the topology of sensor networks will be plete or inaccurate. Thus tracking needs collaborative communication and computation among multiple sensors. 
Thus, the target tracking sensor networks need protocols which can efficiently or-networks. Finally the protocols should make sure high tracking quality. 
In this paper, we propose a distributed and scalable cluster-based protocol (ADCT) to accurately and efficiently track a mobile target using wireless sensor networks. Energy conservation and tracking quality are the two key guidelines of our protocol. In the initial phase, all the nodes in power save model. Given a target to track into the sensor networks, the protocol provides an optimal choice mechanism for locally de-tion. Only these nodes are then active thus minimizing the energy spent on tracking. Additionally, the protocol uses predictive-based and low-delay mechanisms to select new cluster head, and then the new cluster head form a new cluster around the target and reuses the optimal choice mechanism to choose appropriate number of nodes to join in the tracking collaboration. Thus the tracking maintenance can be kept. protocols for target tracking in section 2. We introduce our protocol in detail in sec-tion 3, and present the simulation results in section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper and give the future work in section 5. ergy efficient schemes for target tracking wh ich try to explore good trade-off between energy conservation and tracking quality. Acco rding to the survey by Chuang [1], the researches about the target tracking can be divided into three categories (1) tree-based scheme (2) cluster-based scheme (3) prediction-based scheme. The examples of each scheme are introduced as following: 
Tree-based scheme: In [2] a dynamic convey tree-based collaboration (DCTC) framework has been proposed. The convoy tree includes sensor nodes around the some nodes as the target moves. Relying on the convoy tree, the information about which then sends the gathered information to the base station. DCTC, however, has some limitations, first the tree in the DCTC is a logic tree and does reflect the physi-cal structure of the sensor network, second as the target moves many nodes in the tree may become far from the root of the tree and hence a lot of energy would be wasted for them to send their sensed date to the root. 
Cluster-based scheme: In [3] a dynamic cluster-based algorithm is proposed, it as-sumes that the sensor network is composed of sparsely placed high-capability sensors (CH) and normal nodes. When a CH is triggered by certain signal events, the CH becomes active and then broadcasts an information solicitation packet, asking sensors compresses data and sends the aggregated data to the base station. However, only the CH can be the cluster head, so that the CH can easily overly-utilized. Also in the real environment in some places may have no such CH, thus the tracking of target will be lost. 
Prediction-based scheme: In [4] [5] [6] a prediction-based method has been used to onds (2) the speed and the direction for the next few seconds can be computed by the current sensed data. In some papers, the wake-up mechanism has been taken to work with prediction-based method, according to the prediction result of current sensor nodes to wake up the sensor nodes lying on the predicted moving path, before the target leaves the current detection range and enters the adjacent range. Different wake-up mechanism may be chosen according to different requirements of the appli-three methods may have achieved some energy efficiency in a certain extent. How-ever, for the first method, because one time there is just only one node to monitor the target so the tracking quality cannot be guaranteed. For the second method, the miss-beyond the prediction because in the real environment the target X  X  moving speed and direction maybe change very fast. For the third method, although it considers the many nodes which cannot join in the target tracking in the nearest future. In this section we describe our proposed protocol, ADCT which is aimed at address-networks while especially for efficiently and accurately tracking the moving target. The ADCT protocol includes the following 4 phases. 3.1 Initial Cluster Forming We assume that each node knows the location information of its one-hop neighboring nodes and can estimate the cost of communicating to its one-hop neighboring nodes. target they will form a cluster and enter the target tracking state. Firstly, a cluster head should be elected among the initial nodes. Since the communication cost of determi-nistic leader election is very high, we propose to use a simple heuristic 2 phase-based mechanism to simply determine the cluster head. In the first phase, the sensor nodes that detect the target will be required to broadcast an election message (d i , id i ) with its distance to the target (d i ) and its own ID (id i ) to its neighboring nodes. If a node does head. Finally a join-request message will be se nt by the selected cluster head to ask its one-hop neighbor to join the cluster. After receiving the join-request message, all its one-hop neighboring nodes join the cluster. 3.2 Optimal Sensor Selection The tracking of target requires cluster head to aggregate data among the cluster mem-mation. 
An informed selection of optimal nodes that have the best data and cost less energy for collaboration will save both power and bandwidth cost. Thus not only the tracking quality can be guaranteed but also prolong the lifetime of the sensor network. In our ADCT protocol, we take an optimal choice mechanism to choose the appropriate collaboration. 
After the cluster is formed, the cluster head sends a message which contains the es-While receiving the message, member nodes combine their own measures of target ceived bids and ranks them according to the value of bids. We use a similar method as energy cost: each cluster member combines its own estimate ) ( i m x  X  with the estimate ) ( ch x  X  communication between the cluster head ch and member node i m .  X  is the relative weighting of the usefulness and cost. 
In the selection function )) , ( ( ch m x Q i  X  , it includes two terms. The first term )) , ( ( ch m x member node i m . According to the Mahalanobis distance measure, the usefulness of position estimated by i m and ch . The measure function is below: where i x is the position of member node i m , and x is the target position estimated by i m and ch . energy cost of communication between the cluster head and member node. We use the Euclidean distance as a crude measure of the amount of energy which is required noted as a function related with the distance between the member node and cluster head. The function is below: ( below: This function only relates with cluster head, cluster member and target X  X  posi-tions: 0 x , i x and x . 
After the rank of contributions of nodes in estimating the state of target is created by using the above optimal selection function (4). Appropriate number of nodes can be chosen to incorporate in the tracking co llaboration. According to different specific application and assumption of the sensor networks, the number of the sensor nodes author assumes that the sensor knows the location of each sensor and can identify whether a target is moving away from or towards it. With this assumption, a secon-location of the target. In [11] three sensor nodes are sufficient to determine the loca-tion of the target with the assumption that each node can know the distance between itself and the target and all the sensor nodes in the sensor network have synchronous time. 
In order to make our protocol more suitable to different cases, we do not make such specific assumptions. We only define a parameter: ThresholdNumber (TN). This is a threshold value that the number of optimal nodes chosen should be no more than the stated TN. As in figure 1, we set the TN = 3. According to different tracking tasks the value of TN can be changed through the base station broadcasts a TN message to generates a more precise estimate of the target state. 3.3 Cluster Reconfiguration In this paper we focus on the target that moves with varying speed. As shown in fig-farther away for the target. In order to keep the track maintenance the nodes lying on impact the lifetime of the whole network. 
In most of the existing researches related to the cluster head election in target tracking, sensor networks just simply select a node with the highest residual energy or node which is nearest to the predicted target position to be the cluster head. However, in the real environment, the prediction may be inaccurate because a target may travel at a varying speed all the time. So the existing methods may not be suitable for target tracking application in real sensor network. 
In our ADCT protocol, we take the prediction-based and low-delay algorithm to select a new cluster head. When the predicted position of the target is on the boundary of the current cluster, the current cluster head would send a command message which est to the predictio n location. The node which has received the command message would send a new cluster head solicitation packet to its neighboring nodes and select head to be the new cluster head. The new cluster head then combine with its one-hop neighbor to form a cluster and reuses the optimal choice mechanism to select optimal member nodes to incorporate in the tracking collaboration. Thus the process of target mation of the target back to the base station. 3.4 Tracking Lost Detection and Recovery Our ADCT protocol uses a prediction-based and low-delay algorithm to select a new cluster head. However when the target changes its direction or/and velocity so detectable region of the sensors selected for the sensing task. So a mechanism which can detect and recover the lost of tracking is used in this paper. When the new cluster detects the target, the new cluster head will send a detection confirmation message to the former cluster head in a predetermined time period. If the former cluster head does not get any confirmation in the predetermined time period, it assumes that the lost of the base station. Then the base station will wake up all the sensor nodes to restart the tracking task. To evaluate the performance of our protocol, we have implemented it on the ns-2 simulator. Our goals in conducting the simulation are as following: (1) Compare the adaptability of the ADCT protocol with other protocols to differ-ent speed change probability of the target (2) Compare the performance of the ADCT protocol with other protocols on the basis of energy consumption. (3) Study the effect of the ThresholdNumber (TN) on ADCT. In the simulation we set TN = 1 and 3. 4.1 Simulation Environment The simulation has been performed within a 100m x 100m 2-dimensional square sensing area. The nodes are placed uniformly and randomly in the network but the node density should be large enough so that for any arbitrary location sensing region lected between 0 and Vmax and its direction will change o x . The monitoring radius of sensor node is 10m, and the distance between each sensor is 5m. 4.2 Simulation Results In the simulation, we compare our ADCT protocol with other existing tree-based method, prediction-based method and dynamic cluster-based methods. For the predic-tion-based method we choose the wake-up mechanism that wakes all the nodes on the simulation results: 1) Miss probability with different speed change probability of the target: From figure 3 we can see that when the speed change probability is low, both the dynamic cluster-based and prediction-based method perform better than the proposed (TN=3) method and the proposed (TN=1) method performs the worst. However as the speed change probability increasing, the proposed (TN=3) method performs better than other methods and the proposed (TN=1) performs better than the prediction-based and tree-based methods. 
The result of the simulation indicates that our proposed method has a better adapta-tion to the fast varying speed target tracking compared to other existing methods and we can change the value of the TN to adjust tracking quality. 2) Energy consumption: We compare the performance of the ADCT protocol with other protocols on the basis of energy consumption. From the figure 4 we can see that our proposed method performs much better than other methods. As expected, the proposed(TN=1) method performs better than the proposed(TN=3) method and other less than other protocols. 
From the simulation results we can see that it is important to choose a suitable value of TN to achieve a good trade-off between energy conservation and tracking quality. In this paper, we present a novel protocol, ADCT, for tracking a moving target. This protocol uses the optimal choice mechanism and dynamic cluster-based approach to achieve a good balance between tracking quality and energy efficiency. By optimally choosing the nodes which have better tracking qualification to participate in tracking task both the tracking quality and energy efficiency are achieved. The dynamic clus-ter-based mechanism significantly reduces the amount of message exchange during energy efficiency. 
In the future, we are going to work on a new cluster head selection algorithm based on other specific sensor network applications. Another possible direction of our work is to accommodate mobile sensors. With mobile sensors the more complicate and wiser methods may be necessary for the solution.
