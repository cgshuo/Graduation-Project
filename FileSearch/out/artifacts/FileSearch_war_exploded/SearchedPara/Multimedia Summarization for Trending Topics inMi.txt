 Microblogging services have revolutionized the way people exchange information. Confronted with the ever-increasing numbers of microblogs with multimedia contents and trend-ing topics, it is desirable to provide visualized summarization to help users to quickly grasp the essence of topics. While ex-isting works mostly focus on text-based methods only, sum-marization of multiple media types (e.g., text and image) are scarcely explored. In this paper, we propose a multimedia microblog summarization framework to automatically gen-erate visualized summaries for trending topics. Specifically, a novel generative probabilistic model, termed multimodal-LDA (MMLDA), is proposed to discover subtopics from mi-croblogs by exploring the correlations among different media types. Based on the information achieved from MMLDA, a multimedia summarizer is designed to separately identify representative textual and visual samples and then form a comprehensive visualized summary. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world Sina Weibo microblog dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against the state-of-the-art approaches.

Recent years have witnessed the emergence of microblog-ging services that change the way people live, work and com-microblogging platforms on the Web, has attracted more than 500 million registered users, and the average number of daily active users has reached 46 million by the end of such platforms, such as news, images and video links. With the wide availability of information sources, rapid informa-tion propagation and ease of use, microblogging has quickly become one of the most important media for sharing, dis-tributing and consuming interesting contents, such as the trending topics.
 Currently, some microblogging platforms, such as Sina Weibo, offer users the list of (manually created) hot trend-ing topics, together with a set of related microblogs in each trend. Such service offers a potentially useful way to help users to conveniently gain a quick and concise impression of the current hot topics. In addition, users may obtain further understanding of the topics by browsing the related mircoblogs. However, due to the tremendous volume of mi-croblogs and the lack of effective summarization mechanism in existing trending topic services, users are often confronted with incomplete, irrelevant and duplicate information, which makes it difficult for users to capture the essence of a topic. Therefore, it would be of great benefit if an effective mecha-nism can be provided to automatically mine and summarize subtopics (i.e., divisions of a main topic) from microblogs related to a given topic.

It is natural to formulate microblog summarization as a multi-document summarization (MDS) task, which has been extensively studied in information retrieval. Over the years, numerous methods have been proposed. Notable ap-proaches include the frequency-based methods, e.g., Sum-Basic [8] and MEAD [9], and semantic-based methods such as LSA [4] or LDA [5]. In addition, other methods such as the graph-based methods (e.g., LexPageRank [3]) and ma-chine learning-based methods [11] have also been proposed. However, the previous MDS techniques are designed for well-organized texts, such as the news articles. There exist two challenges that make it greatly difficult to directly utilize the traditional MDS techniques to summarize microblogs: 1) short text length (e.g., a maximum 140 characters for Twitter) and 2) noisy and/or irrelevant microblog contents. Recently, several attempts [1, 2, 6, 10] have been made to summarize microblog texts by considering the above limita-tions. For example, Sharifi et al. [10] summarized Twitter hot topics through finding the most commonly used phrase t hat encompasses the topic phrase. Inouye et al. [6] pro-posed a cluster summarizer based on the designed hybrid TF-IDF weighting. Nonetheless, the performance of these methods is still far from satisfactory because they did not address the problem of lack of expressive power caused by word restriction and noisy content.

Different from traditional documents that contain only textual objects, microblogs comprise of multiple media types, such as image and text. The high proportion of multime-dia contents are precious resources for handling the above problems. It has been shown that integrating multiple types of media content may boost the performance of various real applications [14, 12]. The benefit of incorporating different media types into summarization is three-fold: 1) Images can supplement the textual content with additional information, especially in the circumstance of microblogging, where the text lacks sufficient expressive power as aforementioned. 2) Multimedia contents can facilitate subtopic discovery. In-tuitively, given a trending topic, multimedia contents from different subtopics should have lower visual similarity while those within the same subtopic should have higher visual similarity. Thus, discriminative information embedded in visual information of multimedia contents can be exploited as critical cues for subtopic discovery. 3) Incorporating con-crete multimedia exemplars into summarization can assist users to gain a more visualized understanding of interesting topics and/or subtopics.

However, it is non-trivial to integrate multimedia informa-tion to generate comprehensive summaries in the circum-stance of microblogs. Without proper exploration of the intrinsic correlation among various media types, they may exert negative influence on each other. Based on the above analysis, in this paper we propose a novel framework to sum-marize multimedia microblogs for trending topics. Specifi-cally, we first propose a novel generative probabilistic model, termed multimodal-LDA (MMLDA), to partition the mi-croblogs related to the same topic into several subtopics. MMLDA model is capable of not merely capturing the in-trinsic correlation between visual and textual information of microblogs, but also estimating the general distribution as well as subtopic-specific distribution under a trending topic. Based on the information achieved from MMLDA model, a summarizer is further elaborated to separately identify rep-resentative textual and visual samples and then form a com-prehensive visualized summary. For text summarization, we specify three criteria, namely coverage, significance and di-versity to measure the summarization quality. A greedy al-gorithm is developed to identify representative textual sam-ples. For visual summarization, a two-step process is devised to automatically select the most representative images: 1) images within a subtopic are grouped by spectral cluster-ing; and 2) images in each group are ranked by a manifold ranking algorithm and the top-ranked image is selected as representative. The flowchart of the proposed multimedia microblog summarization framework is illustrated in Figure 1. We can see that there are two main stages in the whole process: subtopic discovery and summary generation. We elaborate details of the two stages in the following sections.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally defines the problem. The details of the proposed MMLDA model for subtopic discovery are elaborated in Sec-tion 3. The process of generating multimedia summaries is introduced in Section 4. Experimental results are reported and discussed in Section 5, followed by the conclusion in Section 6.
Suppose we are given a collection of microblogs M = { M 1 , ..., M |M| } related to the same trending topic T , where each microblog M i = { T i , I i } consists of two components: textual component T i and visual component I i . Note that I may be empty, which means M i contains no visual sam-ples. | | denotes the cardinality of a set. The objective of our framework is to automatically generate a multimedia summary (e.g., both textual and visual) from the microblog collection M for revealing the multiple subtopics of topic T . For topic T , we define its topic-level summary as the union of all its subtopics X  summaries, denoted as S K k =1 S k , where K is the number of subtopics of T . For each subtopic, a subtopic-level summary comprises both textual and visual exemplars idetified from M .
In this section, we propose a novel generative probabilis-tic model, termed multimodal-LDA (MMLDA), to jointly model the relations between the visual and textual facets of microblogs in order to facilitate the subtopic discovery as well as the subsequent multimedia summary generation.
To model the relations among different media types, we introduce a shared latent variable Z to jointly model the semantics embedded in all media types. Different from tra-ditional LDA which assigns a mixture of multiple latent topics to each document, the proposed MMLDA model as-sociates only one semantic facet Z , i.e., subtopic, to each microblog. Note that microblog content is usually short and focused, hence it is reasonable to assume that each microblog only contains one subtopic. For each microblog, its textual words and visual words are generated from the same shared subtopic Z , where Z can be regarded as a semantic represen-tation of the integration of visual and textual modalities in terms of a shared distribution over factors that each visual o r textual object can be assembled from.

We observe that all subtopics of the same topic may share some general words which indicate the common semantics related to the trending topic; while each individual subtopic uniquely possesses certain specific semantics, which distin-guish itself from the other subtopics. Take the trending topic  X  X ushan Earthquake X  X s an example,  X  X arthquake X , X  X ushan X  and X  X eath X  X re more likely to be general words; while words like  X  X ypocenter X ,  X  X ollapse X  and  X  X remier X  are more prob-able to appear in different subtopics. If the proportion of general contents is large, then they may dominate the result. In order to exclude the influence of general contents and dis-cover discriminative cues for each subtopic, two new latent variables R and Q are introduced to generate the textual and visual words, respectively. For each textual (visual) word, R ( Q ) indicates whether it is generated from the general dis-tribution or from the specific distribution corresponding to its subtopic. Next, we introduce the details of modeling and inference for MMLDA.
The graphical representation of MMLDA model is illus-trated in Figure 2, and the detailed generation process is depicted as follows: 1. For the topic T , draw  X  T G  X  Dir (  X  T G ) and  X  V G 2. For each subtopic, draw  X  T S k  X  Dir (  X  T S ) and  X  V S 3. For each microblog M i , draw Z i  X  Multi (  X  Z ), cor-4. For each textual word position of M i , draw a variable 5. The generation of visual words is similarly done as in
In our MMLDA model, the subtopic assignment Z as well as general-specific indicators R and Q are latent variables to be inferred from the observations, i.e., textual and vi-sual words. We use Gibbs sampling to achieve the infer-ence due to its efficiency and effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. With Gibbs sampling, the latent variables can be obtained, as well as the specific textual/visual dis-tributions  X  T S and  X  V S . For any textual word w ,  X  T S Figure 2: Graphical illustration of MMLDA model. m easures the probability of w appearing in the k -th specific textual distribution, while  X  V S k ( u ) measures that of visual distribution. These specific distributions can be inferred as follows: where V t and V v denote textual and visual vocabulary, re-spectively. N w ( Z = k, R = S ) represents the number of textual word w in the k -th specific textual distribution af-ter Gibbs sampling process stops. The meaning of N u ( Z = k, Q = S ) is similar.

With MMLDA model, we manage to discover the subtopics of a given trending topic by exploring relations among tex-tual and visual modalities. The obtained textual-visual dis-tribution pair  X  T S k - X  V S k depicts the discriminative multime-dia cues for each subtopic. According to the subtopic as-signment Z for each microblog, MMLDA partitions the mi-croblog collection M into K subsets {S k }| K k =1 corresponding to K subtopics. Further, we separate each subset into tex-tual part S t k and visual part S v k . Next, we will employ the above results achieved with MMLDA for summarization.
In this section, we first elaborate the processes of generat-ing textual and visual summaries for each subtopic, by utiliz-ing the reinforced textual/visual distributional information. Then, the textual and visual summaries are aggregated to form a comprehensive multimedia summary.
We propose a text summarizer to automatically generate a summary for microblog text. Specifically, a greedy algo-rithm is developed to sequentially select representative sam-ples based on a novel selection criterion, which takes three fundamental requirements into consideration: 1) Coverage , which implies that the summary should keep alignment with the original data collection, and reduce the information loss to the greatest extent; 2) Significance , which reveals that we should select microblogs that attract the greatest inter-ests; and 3) Diversity , which indicates the summary should be concise and contain as little redundant information as possible.
In the following part, we introduce how the above three vi-t al facets are embodied into the selection criterion. Without loss of generality, we consider the textual summary genera-tion of the k -th subtopic from the subset S t k . Denote G as the summary set consists of the selected textual samples, and  X  S t k = S t k  X  X  k is the remaining subset. In order to de-termine which sample is subsequently selected from  X  S t calculate a selection score for each sample by considering coverage, significance and diversity as follows.
 Coverage. Intuitively, if a summary is able to well  X  X over X  the information of its corresponding subtopic, then the word distributions over both of them should be close to each other. The word distribution over a summary G k , denoted as  X  G can be estimated as: where tf ( w,  X  G k ) denotes the term frequency of word w in G .  X  T S k is used as the word distribution over the corre-sponding subtopic, which is the distribution estimated in the learning process of MMLDA model (Eq. 1). We employ Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to measure the distance of two distributions D 1 and D 2 as:
Given the current summary set G k , the new sample T i to be selected should be the one that makes the new summary (i.e., G k  X  X  T i } ) achieve the best coverage (i.e., minimize the distance between  X  G age of each candidate T i could be measured by the following equation: Significance. In general, the popularity of a microblog can be revealed from the repost number. A large repost num-ber means that the microblog has gained a lot of attention and interest from other users, and can indirectly represent the quality of this microblog. Therefore, we use the repost number to measure the significance of a candidate: Diversity. We take the information redundancy into con-sideration in sample selection. Consider a candidate T i , the redundancy it brings to the summary set can be measured by the similarity between this candidate and the previously generated summary, which is: Overall Selection Score. The overall selection score is defined as a weighted linear combination of the above three scores. Define F ( x ) = 1 / (1 + exp (  X  x )) as a logistic in-creasing function for normalizing the scores to interval [0 , 1]. Since we favor a small distance for U C ( T i ), and large values for the other two criteria, the overall selection score is com-puted as:
U ( T i )=  X  1 (1  X  X  ( U C ( T i )))+  X  2 F ( U S ( T i ))+  X  where  X  1 ,  X  2 ,  X  3 are trade-off parameters with P i  X 
With the above selection score for all the microblog sam-ples, we may derive the greedy algorithm for representative sample selection. In each iteration, we calculate the selec-tion scores for all the remaining samples in  X  S t k , and then move the one with the largest score from  X  S t k to G k :
Consider the visual subset S v k , which contains all images related to the k -th subtopic. The objective of this step is to select representative images which can best depict the cur-rent subtopic. The selected images should provide enough visual description as well as diverse viewpoints. We develop a two-step approach to automatically select representative images satisfying the above two criteria: 1) apply spectral clustering to group the image set S v k into visually diverse clusters; and 2) rank images within each cluster with a mani-fold ranking algorithm and the top-ranked ones are identified as representative samples.
 Clustering step. Define the k -Nearest-Neighbors similar-ity graph of S v k as:
W where x i is the bag-of-visual-word representation of image I  X  S v k , d ( , ) is the Euclidean distance, and  X  is the band-width parameter. N k ( x i ) denotes the set of k nearest neigh-bors of x i in S v k . We then apply normalized cut to the image set to achieve visual diversity across the clusters. Ranking step. In order to discover images with best rep-resentative ability within each cluster, we adopt manifold ranking algorithm to rank the images. Let D denote the degree matrix of W and r as the vector of ranking score, manifold ranking defines an iterative update process as fol-lows: where h represents the vector of initial ranking scores, which is an all-one vector in standard manifold ranking setting. However, in our scenario, we expect h to possess the prior knowledge of the importance of each image. Recall that with MMLDA model, we have achieved the discriminative visual information for this subtopic, which is  X  V S k . Intuitively, if an image is more consistent with  X  V S k , it would have bet-ter descriptive ability for the whole subtopic image set, and should gain more emphasis. Therefore, instead of all-one vector which takes equal weighting for all images, we ex-press h as prior knowledge measured by the KL divergency of an image I i and  X  V S k , i.e., h i = 1  X  X  ( D KL ( I integrating the prior knowledge in the ranking scheme, the descriptive ability for the cluster as well as for the subtopic image set are both taken into consideration.

Finally, the image with the largest ranking value in r is selected from each cluster to construct the visual summa-rization set.
We constructed the evaluation dataset by selecting 10 Figure 3: Detailed performance (ROUGE-1) of M MTS, MMTS-I and the comparing methods over all 10 topics. we crawled the related microblogs in the life cycle of this topic. Due to limited information appended to repost action, only the original microblogs were included in our dataset, resulting in 127 , 118 microblogs and 48 , 656 images. In or-der to evaluate the quality of the generated summaries, five volunteers were invited to manually generate a textual sum-mary for each topic as gold standard. Each manually gen-erated summary consists of 50 microblogs selected from the microblog dataset.

In text pre-processing procedure, we first segmented Chi-low-frequency words with document frequency of less than 5, and mentions (@somebody) from the textual vocabulary. Texts containing less than 3 words were also eliminated. For visual feature extraction, Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors were firstly extracted from each image. Then we trained a codebook of 1,000 visual words with de-scriptors sampled from images of all topics. With the trained codebook, each descriptor was quantized into a visual word. Each image was further represented as a 1,000-dimensional  X  -normalized bag-of-visual-words feature.

For concentration parameters in MMLDA model, as stated in [5], the more specific a distribution is meant to be, the smaller its parameter. Accordingly, we set  X  T G =0 . 1,  X  0 . 01,  X  V G = 1,  X  V S = 0 . 1,  X  R = 0 . 1,  X  Q = 0 . 1, and  X  For the final representation image selection procedure, the parameter  X  is set to 0 . 85. According to our observation, the number of subtopics is limited for most topics. There-fore, we empirically set the subtopic number K to 10. While in our experiments, it is observed that some subtopics con-tain very small number of microblogs. We argue that such subtopics are probably composed of noisy microblogs and should be removed. In practice, we empirically choose a threshold  X  = 0 . 03 and remove all the subtopics whose sizes are smaller than  X  |M| . The total number of the selected microblogs is chosen to be 50, which is the same as the num-ber of microblogs in the gold standards. The 50 microblogs quota are assigned to the remaining subtopics according to the proportion of microblog number in each subtopic.
We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework as compared to several summarization approaches. For eval-uation metric, we employ ROUGE evaluation toolkit [7] which automatically determines the quality of a summary as compared to human generated golden standards. In partic-Table 1: Comparison among different summariza-tion approaches. Average results of the 10 topics are reported for all evaluation measurement.
 Table 2: Effects of coverage, significance and diver-s ity criteria in subtopic discovery.
 ular, F-measure scores of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-W (with W set to 1.2) and ROUGE-SU are reported. For fairness of evaluation, we select 50 microblogs for all the comparing approaches to form the summaries.

We compare our proposal with the following summariza-tion approaches: 1) LSA [4], which conducts SVD on sam-ple by term matrix first and select samples with highest entry value starting from most significant left eigenvector. 2) SNMF [13], which constructs the sample-sample similar-ity matrix first, clusters all samples with Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) and extracts center-ing sentences from the clusters. 3) KMEANS [9], which per-forms K-means clustering over the dataset and selects sam-ples nearest to cluster centers. 4) TWISUM [6], which is a twitter summarization algorithm based on the proposed hy-brid TF-IDF measurement. For our proposed approach, two specific methods are evaluated for comparison: 1) MMTS, the whole framework that uses both text and visual contents in constructing MMLDA model. 2) MMTS-I, which adopts the framework of MMTS without utilizing the visual infor-mation, i.e., in the subtopic discovery stage, when applying MMLDA model, all microblog samples are assumed to be comprised of texts only.

The overall comparison of proposed MMTS and MMTS-I with the other approaches are shown in Table 1. In addition, detailed ROUGE-1 performance for each topic is shown in Figure 3. As seen from the results, the proposed MMTS out-performs other methods for all topics as well as all evaluation measurements. The good performance of MMTS benefits from the following three aspects:
First of all, visual information is utilized in MMTS, the impact of which can be demonstrated by comparing the re-sults of MMTS and MMTS-I. The latter approach differs from MMTS only with the lack of visual component. The performance illustrates the degradation of summarization ability when visual information is not used.

Secondly, MMTS discovers subtopics before the summa-rization procedure. As a result, all important branches for Figure 4: A multimedia microblog summarization e xample on Topic 1. a topic are covered in the final summarization. Although some comparing methods also consider the coverage of the summarization for the dataset, the coverage is only consid-ered at the topic-level rather than the subtopic-level. In case a subtopic contains a small number of microblogs, there is a high probability that the microblogs related to this subtopic will be ignored by the comparing methods. The high perfor-mance of MMTS-I as compared to all the baseline methods demonstrates the effectiveness of subtopic discovery for en-hancing the summarization performance.

Thirdly, three criteria (coverage, significance and diver-sity) are specified in MMTS, which are able to further facil-itate the summary generation. We conduct experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of each individual component by removing each of the three criteria from our framework. The result is shown in Table 2. MMTS-C (MMTS-S or MMTS-D) denotes the method without taking coverage (significance or diversity) into consideration. The three trade-off param-eters are set to  X  1 = 0 . 33,  X  2 = 0 . 33,  X  3 = 0 . 33 for MMTS. While for the three comparing methods, we set  X  to 0 . 5 for the two considered criteria, and 0 for the removed criterion. As can be seen, the performance of removing any criterion becomes worse, which illustrates that all components are necessary for our framework. Specifically, removing signif-icance degrades the results the most, which demonstrates that users would more favor hot microblogs with large re-post numbers.

An example of our summarization result is shown in Fig-ure 4. This is a summary on Topic 1. Due to space limita-tion, only four subtopics are shown. For each subtopic, we list the top 3 images and top 3 texts. This example demon-strates the ability of our proposed framework in 1) well or-ganizing the messy microblogs into structured subtopics; 2) generating high quality textual summary at subtopic level; and 3) selecting images relevant to subtopic that can best represent the textual contents.
In this paper, we proposed a multimedia microblog sum-marization method to automatically generate visualized sum-maries for trending topics. Specifically, a novel multimodal-LDA (MMLDA) model was proposed to discover various subtopics as well as the subtopic content distribution from microblogs, which explores the correlation among different media types. Based on MMLDA, a summarizer is elabo-rated to generate both textual and visual summaries. We conducted extensive experiments on a real world Sina Weibo microblog dataset to show the superiority of our proposed method as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
