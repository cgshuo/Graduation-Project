 This poster overviews the main characteristics of a flexible retrieval systems of shapes present in binary image s and discusses some evaluation results. The system applies multipl e indexing criteria of the shapes synthesizing distinct charac teristics such as global features of the objects contour (Fourier Coe fficients), boundary irregularities (Multifractal Spectrum), pr esence of concavities and convexities on the boundary (Contou r Scale Space). The system is flexible since it allows cust omizing the retrieval function to fit an application need. The query consists in submitting to the system a binary image containing a desired shape and in specifying the distinct importance of the shape characteristics that must be taken into account to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved shapes. The retrieval fu nction is then defined as a Flexible Multicriteria fusion Function producing ranked results. The evaluation experiments showed t hat this system can be suited to different retrieval purpose s, and that generally the combination of the distinct shape ind exing criteria increases both Recall and Precision with respect to the application of any single indexing criterion alone. indexing and Retrieval]: Information Search and Ret rieval.
 General Terms: Algorithms, Design, Experimentation. Keywords: shapes indexing and retrieval. designed for specific applications, and thus they a dopt a single indexing method and a rigid retrieval scheme implem enting a single retrieval function that demonstrated its eff ectiveness in a given context . specific application, so we defined the model and d esigned the system by considering as main requirements its flex ibility, meant as the possibility to suit the retrieval results yi elded by the system to fit distinct user needs. To this end we conceive d the shape retrieval system as performing a Flexible Multi Cri teria Decision making activity in which: from the CSS distribution a n-dimension vector of r eal values is computed in which the i-th element is the number of concavities/convexities with a wideness greater th an  X  i ; - X the irregularity/linearity of the boundary that can be approximately related to the Multi-Fractal Spectrum (MFS) of the shape contour [2]; -the presence on the boundary of global shape feat ures that can be approximately described by the Fast Fourier Coef ficients (FFC) [3]; to rotation and scaling of the shapes. Besides thes e shapes descriptors also some metric descriptors are comput ed, such as the area, the circularity and fractal dimension. These indexes can be used in the retrieval phase to pre-filter the shape s in the archive to minimize the set of items on which to evaluate the soft constraints on the shapes characteristics. This allows to reduc e the cost of the retrieval function. We conducted the evaluations on two collections: a collection of 1100 shapes of marine creatures, gently provided by the University of Surrey (UK) [5] and a collection of l eaves with distinct shapes and irregularity of the contour, so me of them artificially generated so as to emphasise the irreg ularity of the contour to test the effect of the different sets of descriptors. 
Fig 2: ranked leaves with FFC (above) and MFS (below): the colour distinguishes the contour regularity degree (red smoothest) Figure 2 reports the first eight ranked leaves (fro m left to right) by using only the FFC and the MFS respectively given t he query at the left: it can be observed that with MFS we retri eve the leaves with decreasing irregularity of the contour, while with the FFC the ranking reflects a similarity of global shape featu res. We visually classified the marine creature into six classes acc ording to the similarity of their silouette. We then submitted si x queries by taking a fish from each category and performing the retrieval first on the basis of each single set of descriptors (FFC , CSS, MFS) and then by considering all the descriptors with th e same weight, and with distinct weights emphasising some evident characteristics of the ideal shapes (in figure 3 we show the ranked list of shapes given the first top left shape as qu ery and a retrieval function that takes into account all the indexing c riteria with equal importance) . It can be seen how only 6 out of 50 s hown shapes belong to a different category than the query categ ory, and the first wrong element is 23rd position. In Figure 4 we report the average R-P graph for each applied retrieval functi on obtained by considering the six queries: it can be noticed how the single indexing criteria produce worse results than by con sidering all the criteria with either same weight or best weights. Further it can be noticed that the CSS criterion alone is very influe nt on the overall effectiveness. These preliminary results are encour aging, even if
