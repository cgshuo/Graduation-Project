 1. Introduction
Over the past few years in many countries the power systems are going toward creating a competitive formation by usage of different ways such as deregulation in order to deal electrical energy. Also, economic and environmental constraints of building new distribution lines are adding notable complexities to the operation of distribution systems. Some procedures and facilities are needed in order to provide electric power for the distribution systems with higher efficiency, quality and security without investment on building new distribution lines ( Gu and Rizy, 1996 ). In distribution networks, voltage control is a tough and sensitive procedure since voltages are eventually influenced by dynamic load fluctuations. Hence, utilities strengthen their power systems in order to have a better control over voltage variations ( Milosevic and Begovic, 2004 ). Usage of analytical tools such as optimal power flow (OPF) and voltage stability analysis can minimize bus voltage deviations. In addition, voltage profile can be amended by using some devices such as transformers with on-load tap changers (OLTCs), fixed and controlled capacitors banks,
DGs and AVRs ( Vu et al., 1996 ; Chang et al., 1990 ). Since, the utilization of some equipment such as AVRs in distribution networks depends on their investment costs, thus, the optimal location of AVRs has become a crucial problem. Multiple advantages of DGs in distributed systems carried out by research centers illustrate that DGs participation in energy generation will be increased to even more than 25% in near future. Therefore, intense attention is vital to be paid to effects of DGs in power systems, especially on the distribution systems ( Niknam, 2008 ; Niknam et al., 2010 ; Olamaei et al., 2008 ). Very often DG modeling is addressed as a deterministic problem. However, many random disturbances or uncertain factors exist during the DG operations due to measurement errors, forecast inaccuracies or outages of DG elements. These uncertainties mainly come from changes in network configuration, power supplies etc. The availability of distribution power generation is an uncertain factor in power systems. In particular, recent attention is paid to the increasing penetration of renewable generation in power systems such as wind and solar energy which necessitates the modeling of stochastic generation outputs. These uncertainties inevitably introduce errors in the optimal solutions and thus degenerate the decisions of a deterministic optimization problem. The neces-sity of modeling the variable nature of the renewable energy as a stochastic optimization approach for solving modern power system problems are discussed in Jabr and Pal (2009) , Zhang and Li (2010 ). It is worthwhile to note that the proposed approach does not consider the stochastic nature of renewable energy in another word the deterministic model of DG is considered in this paper.

Up to now, a large number of single-objective optimization methods like simulated annealing (SA) and artificial neural net-works ( Ng et al., 2000 ) have been utilized for solving the optimal placement and sizing of capacitor banks optimization problem.
Moreover the stated before techniques; nowadays, fuzzy logic ( Milosevic and Begovic, 2004 ) and evolutionary algorithms ( Masoum et al., 2004a , 2004b ; Alencar de Souza et al., 2004 ;
Chiou et al., 2004 ) are also applied to solve the optimization problem of optimal placement of capacitor banks in distribution systems. In order to optimize the tap position and the ON/OFF state of the capacitor banks, analytical tools like optimal power flow have been applied ( Bridenbaugh et al., 1992 ). In ( Roytelman and Ganesan, 2000 ; and Augugliaro et al., 2004 ) the optimal location of OLTCs and capacitor banks has been illustrated by an evolutionary multi-objective approach. The optimal location of
AVRs is studied separately from the placement and sizing of the capacitor banks problem in ( Civanlar and Grainger, 1985a , 1985b , 1985c ). In the same way, in Safigianni and Salis (2000 ), authors specified the location of AVRs by usage of a sequential algorithm.
In order to choose the optimal location of AVRs in radial distribution systems a simple genetic algorithm (GA) has been implemented in Mendoza et al. (2005 ). In all previous approaches, authors used a weighted sum method for solving the multi-objective optimization problem. However, this method has a deficiency, in which final solution extensively depends on the values of the weights. Because the optimal operation in distribu-tion systems is a nonlinear optimization problem and in the same time evolutionary optimization algorithms have an extensive application in solving both nonlinear and complex optimization problems, so optimal solution could be obtained through these algorithms ( Niknam et al., 2010 ; Niknam, 2010 ). Since the objective functions of the proposed problem are not the same, so the classical approaches that optimize single objective pro-blems are not proper to solve the presented problem. Hence, the presented approach firstly models the multiple-objectives by usage of fuzzy sets for assessing their imprecise nature. Evolu-tionary optimization algorithms like SA, particle swarm optimiza-tion (PSO), honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) have a set of parameters that affect the algorithm performance. For example, SA needs determination of the temperature variation ( T ) in each iteration; HBMO requires definition of the drones number, queen X  X  velocity and its variation in each iteration; ACO needs definition of pheromone intensity (chemical material-t ) and its variation in each iteration and the control parameters for defining the weights of trial intensity and length of path ( g 1 and g 2 ); PSO needs learning factors and the inertia weight which exact adjustment of these parameters is a difficult task for handling. However TLBO does not requires any parameters to be adjusted hence implementation of TLBO is simpler. The TLBO algorithm takes advantage of two different phases, the teacher phase and the learner phase. In the proposed approach in order to improve both the velocity and accuracy of the convergence and to avoid premature convergence to the local optima, both of the teacher phase and leaner phase are modified in which this modified algorithm is named as MTLBO algorithm.
Inasmuch, the objectives conflict each other in multi-objective problems, therefore it is ordinary to obtain a squad of solutions instead one solution. For solving the multi-objective problems, some procedures can be utilized. One of these methods is Max X 
Min that performs by improvement of the worst solution and convert of multi-objective into single-objective. In the proposed approach Pareto optimal solution is implemented which operates based on dominate and non-dominate concept and can find a non-dominated solution that depicts the best possible trade-offs among the objectives. The decision maker can select any of the Pareto optimal solutions according to his/her own preferences.
In order to validate the presented approach, it is applied on a 70-bus test system also, the obtained results are compared with other evolutionary methods such as GA, PSO and TLBO. Finally, to authenticate the obtained Pareto optimal solutions, three criter-ions involve generational distance (GD), Spacing (SP), and Diver-sity metric are used ( Coello Coello et al., 2004 ).

The main contributions of the paper are as follows: (i) Present a new multi-objective algorithm for location of automatic voltage regulators in radial distribution networks. (ii) Propose a new method for modifying the original TLBO to reach an efficient TLBO method. (iii) Use three criterions in order to authenticate the obtained
Pareto front. 2. Multi-objective location of automatic voltage regulators 2.1. Objective functions 2.1.1. Total electricity cost
The objective functions and constraints are proposed in this section, the first objective function which is considered is total electricity cost and defined as follows: min f 1  X  X  X  X  X  P sub price sub  X  X 
P  X  X  X  X  P DG , Tap AVR , Location AVR 1 n  X  3  X  P Tap AVR  X  X  Tap 1 , Tap 2 , ::: , Tap NAVR  X  5  X  Location AVR  X  X  Location AVR 1 , Location AVR 2 , ::: , Location n  X  X  N DG  X  2 NAVR  X  X  7  X  where X is the state variables vector containing tap positions and location of AVRs and active power of DGs. NAVR is the number of
AVRs, P DG is active power vector of all DGs, TAP AVR is the tap vector which represents the tap positions of all AVRs, Location and value of the injected active power to the distribution system, respectively. P DG i is the active power of the i th distributed generator, price DG i is the electricity price of i th DG, V are the magnitude and angle of slack bus voltage and N DG number of DGs, respectively. y sub, j and Y sub, j are the angle and value of admittance between slack bus and j th bus, correspond-ingly. d j and V j are the angle and magnitude of the voltage at the j th bus, correspondingly.

It is worthwhile to note that the number of the applied AVRs in the presented approach is supposed fixed and that is why in calculation of f 1  X  X  X  AVRs prices are not considered. DGs
The total loss is the second objective function which is considered in this approach and defined as follows: min f 2  X  X  X  X  P Loss  X  where R i and I i is the resistance and current of the i th branch, respectively. N b is the number of branches in distribution systems. 2.1.3. Voltage deviation
The third considered objective function is voltage deviation which is determined as the difference between the nodes voltage and reference ones. The voltage deviation is computed as follow: min f 3  X  X  X  X  where, V i ref is the appropriate voltage at i th bus, V i magnitude of the i th bus and N bus is the number of buses. 2.2. Constraints
All considered constraints in the proposed approach are listed as follows: Active power constraints of DG units: the i th DG, respectively.
 AVRs tap position
Tap AVR i is the tap position of the i th AVR, Tap min AVR i are the minimum and maximum tap positions of the i th AVR, respectively.
 Bus voltage magnitude:
V i , V max and V min are the voltage magnitudes of the i th bus and the maximum and minimum values of voltage magnitudes, respectively. 2.3. Fuzzy modeling for normalizing objective functions
In this section a fuzzy method has been proposed to compute the normalized form of objective functions in regard to solve multi-objective optimization. Since the mentioned objective func-tions are imprecise, they are formulated as fuzzy sets. The fuzzy decision making function is depicted by the membership function to substitute each variable as an exact value, as shown in Eq. (13).
A fuzzy set is generally illustrated by a membership function ( m
The fuzzy decision-maker function is depicted by the membership function to substitute each objective function as a value between 0 and 1. Therefore, the value of each membership function shows the adaptability of the related objective. Totally, due to the imprecise nature of the decision maker X  X  judgment, the i th objective function of a solution in the non-dominated set of f depicted by a membership function m i and is defined as follow:  X  f i and f objective function i , respectively.

In a word normalization of objective functions leads to con-fining of them in a same range which is important for decision making process because the objective which has a small value in comparison with other objective values would not sacrifice in decision making process where an importance weight is dedicated to each objective. Furthermore some crucial reasons for applying the fuzzy modeling for normalizing objective func-tions are listed as follow: (i) In order to control the size of repository. (ii) For selecting the best compromise solution between all non-(iii) For updating individuals in each iteration.

The above discussions have been explained in the future sections. 2.4. Pareto optimal solution
Obtaining a squad of optimal solution is an output of solving the multi-objective optimization problem by the Pareto method. The Pareto method can do it by applying the dominance concept. A vector dominates another one while all of its components are less than or equal to the component of other vector and at least one of its component is strictly less than its similar component in other vector ( Tan et al., 2007 ). In other words, X a dominates X follows: if f i  X  X a  X  r f i  X  X b  X 8 i  X f 1 , 2 , ::: , S g and ( j A f 1 , 2 , ::: , S g where f j  X  X a  X  o f j  X  X where S is the number of objective functions. 2.5. External repository
In this paper, an external repository is defined for saving all non-dominate solutions during the optimization process. A can-the following conditions: (i) The repository is empty. (ii) The candidate solution dominates every single one of the (iii) The repository is not full and the candidate solution is not
The above discussions have been explained in the future sections. 3. Automatic voltage regulator (AVR) model
Defining a model for AVR is necessary for depicting its effect on distribution system, ( Niknam et al., 2005 ). AVR is an auto-transformer with individual taps on its windings. The considered model for AVR in this approach is defined as follow: first assume the transformer which has initial tap ratio ( t ) and physical admittance ( Y ) has been connected between buses A and B as p model according to Fig. 1 (b).

When tap ratio of the autotransformer changes from tup to D t , the model of transformer should be changed, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Another way for simulating tap position changes is modifying the model ( Fig. 2 (b)) by adding imaginary injection current, as depicted in Fig. 2 (b) ( Roytelman and Ganesan, 2000 ). Since solving the distribution load flow requires the unaltered topology of network during the load flow process; hence we should simulate the autotransformer by injection current model ( Niknam, 2005 ). By evaluating the KCL equations at bus ( A ) and extracted: KCL at Bus ( A )( Fig. 2 (a)): V  X  1  X  t  X  D t  X  X  Y  X  X  V A V B  X  X  t  X  D t  X  Y  X  0  X  15  X  KCL at Bus ( A )( Fig. 2 (b)): I  X  X  V A V B  X  Y  X  0  X  16  X 
Note that these equations are the same KCL bus equations and can be combined together as follows: V  X  1  X  t  X  D t  X  X  Y  X  X  V A V B  X  X  t  X  D t  X  Y  X  I A  X  X  V A By summarizing Eq. (17), I A is modeled as follows: I  X  X  1  X  t  X  D t  X  X  Y V B  X  18  X  KCL at Bus ( B )( Fig. 2 (a)): V  X  t  X  D t  X  X  X  t  X  D t  X  1  X  Y  X  X  V B V A  X  X  t  X  D t  X  Y  X  0  X  19  X  KCL at Bus ( B )( Fig. 2 (b)): I  X  X  V B V A  X  Y  X  0  X  20  X  It is necessary to note that the Eqs. (19) and (20) are the same KCL bus equations and can be written together as follows: V  X  t  X  D t  X  X  X  t  X  D t  X  1  X  Y  X  X  V B V A  X  X  t  X  D t  X  Y  X  I By summarizing Eq. (21), I B is modeled as follows: I  X  X  1  X  t  X  D t  X  X  Y V A  X  X  X  t  X  D t  X  2 1  X  Y V B  X  22  X  4. Distributed generator modeling and its effect on distribution systems 4.1. DG modeling Generally, DGs in distribution networks can be designed as PV or
PQ models. Since the distribution systems are unbalanced three phase systems, DG can be controlled by following procedures including single phase control and simultaneous three-phase control ( Niknam et al., 2010 , 2003 , 2005 ; Niknam, 2009 ). Based on the control strategies and DG models, four models can be clarified for simulation of these generators. (1) PQ model with simultaneous three-phase control. (2) PV model with simultaneous three-phase control. (3) PQ model with independent three-phase control. (4) PV model with independent three-phase control.

It should be noted that when DGs are considered as PV models, they must produce reactive power for keeping magnitude bus voltages in their proper magnitudes ( Niknam et al., 2010 ), ( Zhu and Tomsovic, 2002 ). For modeling the DGs as PV buses some protocols have been n presented in the literature ( Niknam et al., 2003 ). In the proposed approach the DGs are modeled as PQ buses with simultaneous three-phase control. 4.2. Effect of DGs on distribution systems
When DG unit is connected to the distribution system the power flow and voltage profile of distribution systems will be affected strongly. Since in distribution systems the X = R ratio is low then the DG effect in these systems is considerable. Two-bus test system shown in Fig. 3 is considered for proving the previous statement ( Niknam, 2008 ; 2009 ; Niknam et al., 2010 ).
The voltage sag along the branch from bus 1 to bus 2 is calculated as follows: D V  X  V 1 + d 1 V 2 + d 2  X  X  R  X  j X  X  I  X  23  X 
I  X   X  P  X  j Q  X  n P  X  P Q  X  Q DG  X  Q Load  X  26  X 
D V 2  X   X  RP  X  XQ  X  2  X  X  XP RQ  X  2 reactive power components of the DG and the load, respectively. R  X  j X is the line impedance. According to Eq. (27), neither RP nor
P then the active power components impacts of DG units are much more than their reactive power components. 5. The MTLBO algorithm 5.1. The original TLBO
In this paper a new evolutionary algorithm called teaching X  learning-based optimization (TLBO) is used in order to solve nonlinear mixed integer optimization problems ( Rao et al., 2011 ). To perceive the function basis of the TLBO algorithm suppose two different teachers, T 1 and T 2 that teach a subject with the same content to the same intelligence level learners in two different classes. The distribution of scores achieved by the learners of two varying classes evaluated by the teachers is illustrated in Fig. 4 (a) which M 1 and M 2 are defined as the means of class-1 and class-2 achieved scores, respectively.
A normal distribution is assumed for the achieved scores, but in actual performance it can have skewness. The normal distribu-tion is defined as: f  X  z  X  X  1 where M is the mean, s 2 is the variance and z is any value for which the normal distribution function is required.

By analyzing Fig. 4 (a) and comparing the means of obtained marks for both of the classes, it is perceived that class-2 acquire better outcomes than class-1. In addition to teacher X  X  assistance, learners also learn from interaction between themselves, which this interaction promotes their outcomes.

In accordance with above teaching procedure, for solving the non-linear continuous optimization problem a mathematical model is considered, this model is submitted in frame of an optimization technique called teaching X  X earning-based optimiza-tion (TLBO). The attained marks by learners of class-A with the mean of M A is modeled in Fig. 4 (b). It is obvious that teacher X  X  wisdom is in a higher level than the others in society, so the best learner is considered as the teacher, which is shown by T
Fig. 4 (b). The teacher endeavors to spread all his/her knowledge among learners, which this will increase the knowledge level of the whole class consequently and help learners to get good marks move class mean from M A towards a new mean M B by means of increasing the learners X  knowledge level. From this stage on, the learners are in need with a new teacher, of superior quality than themselves, for instance in this case the new teacher is T shown in class-B as the most knowledgeable person in society.
TLBO population is described as a class of learners. The teacher is considered as the best solution obtained so far. The process of TLBO is divided into two parts. The first part consists of the Teacher Phase and the second part consists of the learner phase. The teacher phase means learning from the teacher and the learner phase means learning through the interaction between learners. It should be noted that the output solutions of the teacher phase are the input solutions for the next phase i.e., learner phase. 5.2. Teacher phase
A good teacher is one who brings his/her learners up to his/her level in terms of knowledge. But in real practice this is not possible and a teacher can only move the average of a class up to some extent depending on the capability of the class. This follows a random process which is interfered by many factors ( Rao et al., 2011 ).

By considering M k and T k , respectively as the average and teacher at iteration of k , T k will endeavor to proceed mean M towards his/her own knowledge level. So the solution is updated according to the difference between teacher  X  X  knowledge level and the mean of the class at any iteration of k , shown by following equation: X diff  X  rand  X  X  X  T k R t M k  X  X  29  X  where rand() is a random number in the range [0,1] and R t teaching factor which determines the value of average to be changed. The magnitude of R t can be either 1 or 2 which is obtained randomly with equal probability.

This difference modifies the existing solution according to the following expression: X 5.3. Learner phase
Learners increase their knowledge by means of two different methods: one through input from the teacher and the other through interaction between themselves. A learner interacts randomly with other learners by the participation in group discussions, formal communications and presentations. By the interaction existed among learners, a learner learns something new if the other learner has more knowledge than him/her ( Rao et al., 2011 ).

As explained, learners increase their knowledge with the help of their mutual interaction. In order to design a mathematical model, select two learners X i and X j by a random choice where I To solve the single objective problem, the achieved objective func-tions of X i and X j arecompared.Iftheachievedobjectivefunction of X i is less than the achieved objective function of X j X
To solve presented problem in form of a multi objective problem, at first all the achieved objective functions of X i and X calculated. If X i vector dominates the X j vector, therefore X
X  X  rand  X  X  X  X i X j  X  otherwise X new  X  X old  X  rand  X  X  X  X by implementation of Pareto method, if the new solution is better than the existed one then it is accepted. It should be noted that the output solutions of the learner phase are the input solutions for the next phase i.e., modified TLBO. 5.4. Modified TLBO
In this paper a modified teaching X  X earning-based optimization (MTLBO) method is proposed to ameliorate the convergence velocity and accuracy of the TLBO algorithm. The first modification to the can be either one or two. In the optimization algorithm the lower value of teaching factor allows the well search in small iterations, but causing slow convergence. A larger value of teaching factor speeds up the search, but it reduces the exploration capability. By considering this fact, in the modified TLBO algorithm the R presented teaching factor in teacher phase, this R t  X  [ r vector which includes n teaching factors for each elements of the control variable.

The second modification is described in the following. Pre-mature convergence may appear under different conditions: the population has converged to the objective function local optimum or the search algorithm has proceeded slowly or has not pro-cogent strategy to diversify the TLBO population and improve the
TLBO X  X  performance in preventing premature convergence to local minima ( Niknam, 2010 ). In presented paper a new mutation operator is applied. In each step, the algorithm mutates vectors a
For each target vector X k i  X  i  X  1 , 2 , , N  X  a mutant vector X is generated as:
X
X f  X  X 3  X  . n isnumberofvectorcomponents.Thetargetvectoris mixed with the mutated vector, using the following scheme: x  X 
To decide whether in succeeding iteration it should become a member of population or not, trial vector X k new is compared to the target vector X k i by computation of their objective functions.
To solve the single objective problem the trial vector X k compared to the target vector X k i as follow:
X  X  X k i if f  X  X k i  X  o f  X  X k new  X  otherwise X k  X  1 new
X , respectively. Since the goal of presented paper is to solve the problem by calculation of more than one objective function, trial vector X k new is compared to the target vector X k
X
X  X  X k new if X k new dominates X k i  X  34  X  If none of the X k i and X k new vectors dominated each other then
Max X  X in method is utilized by application of achieved m i (13) as follow:
X where, S is the number of objective functions. 6. Application of MTLBO algorithm to approach problem
In order to apply the MTLBO algorithm for solving the proposed problem, the following steps should be taken into account.
Step 1: the input data containing network configuration, characteristics of DGs, line impedance, prices of DGs and slack apparent power of buses are defined in this step.

Step 2 : In order to transfer the constraint multi-objective problem to an unconstraint one the following equation should be carried out: J  X  X  X  X  (1), (8) and (9), correspondingly. N eq and N ueq are the number of equality and inequality constraints, respectively. h j  X  X  X  and g the equality and inequality constraints, correspondingly. L are the penalty factors. Since the constraints should be met, the values of these parameters should be high, in this regard they have been considered 100,000.
 Step 3 : Generate the initial population
An initial population based on the chaos initialization was used in this paper as follows: population  X 
X n  X  X  N DG  X  2 NAVR  X  X  39  X  where, N is the number of population and n is the number of control variables. At the beginning, the first learner of the population was generated randomly from [0,1] and was located between the maximum and minimum limits of the control variables. Then the following equation could be used for the rest of the population ( Caponetto et al., 2003 ):
X  X  m X i 1  X  1 X i 1  X  i  X  2 , ::: , N  X  40  X  where, m displays a control parameter which was selected between [0,4]. Eq. (40) was without any stochastic pattern in the value of m and indicated chaotic dynamic when m  X  4 ( Caponetto et al., 2003 ).

Step 4: Compute the objective functions vectors and normalize them by usage of Eq. 13.

It should be noted that the constraint objective functions are transformed to the unconstraint functions according to Eq. (36).
Furthermore for each individual ( X i ) the membership values of all the different objectives are calculated.

Step 5: Compute Pareto optimal solutions by using the obtained normalized objective functions vectors computed in the previous step and save Pareto optimal solutions in the repository. Step 6: Teacher phase.

Calculate the mean of the population column-wise, which will give the mean for the particular as: M  X  X  m 1 , m 2 , ... , m n  X  41  X 
Now in a random process one of the existed Pareto optimal solutions in repository is selected as teacher which is called T Now with having T k and by usage of obtained X diff of Eq. (29),
X new is calculated according to the Eq. (30).

Step 7: If any element of an individual violates its inequality constraints then the position of this individual is set to its maximum/minimum of its operating range.

Now objective functions of X new vector are calculated and
X obtained objective functions vector of the existed vector.
Step 8: Learner phase. As explained above, learners increase their knowledge with the help of their mutual interaction. By usage of the obtained X new vector in Section 5.3 , objective functions are calculated and compared with the obtained objec-tive functions of the existed vector. X new is accepted if obtained objective functions vector of the X new dominates obtained objec-tive functions vector of the existed vector.
 Step 9: The proposed algorithm is modified by Section 5.4 .
Step 10: Compute the objective functions vectors by usage of the distribution load flow result. Also, obtain Pareto optimal solutions among objective functions vectors and add them to the repository.

Step 11: Specify the non-dominate solutions between the repository members.

According to step 10 some non-dominated solutions are added to the repository and they might dominate the solutions which had been existed in the repository, hence it is necessary to apply the Pareto method to specify the non-dominated solutions between the new and old members of repository.

Step 12: if the current iteration number achieves the prede-termined maximum iteration number, then search method stops, otherwise goes to step 6. 7. Simulation results
The location of AVRs in a radial distribution network at the presence of DGs is tested on a 70-bus distribution network ( Das, 2006 ) in this section. The one line diagram of 70-bus distribution the locations of applied DGs. It is worthwhile to note that the pre-sented approach is implemented in MATLAB 7.6 computing environ-ment with Pentium IV, 2.66 GHz computer with 512 MB RAM.
At first all considered objective function including the total cost of electrical energy, the total electrical losses, and voltage deviation objectives are optimized individually. The best result, worst result, average, standard deviation and CPU time values obtained by GA, PSO, TLBO and MTLBO algorithms for different objective functions are displayed in Table 2 .

This table makes it obvious that the proposed algorithm can 14 53 54 other algorithms. The execution time certifies the supremacy of the MTLBO algorithm over other methods. In this table the computed CPU time values for different algorithms demonstrate that the number of the required iterations for convergence is not equal for these algorithms. In regard to prove the capability of MTLBO algorithm, the comparison between convergence plots of
TLBO and MTLBO algorithms is displayed for cost, loss and voltage deviation objective functions in Fig. 6 (a) X (c), respectively.
By applying the MTLBO algorithm, optimal location and tap position of the AVRs and the active power of DGs are computed for different objective functions and tabulated in Table 3 .
From Table 3 it is obvious that all DGs active powers for cost that the generation power cost of DGs is more expensive than the cost of the active power which is injected to the network. Regarding their maximum amount, because when the power demand is produced by DGs, the line power flows are diminished. Because of the previous statement the DGs should generate their maximum power in order to reduce the loss objective function value.
The optimal location and tap position of the AVR devices are deviation values simultaneously. Based on the obtained results it is clear that applying the AVR devices can magnificently improve the characteristics of the power systems. Having some options that based on his/her favorite situations, in this regard Pareto optimal solution which can reach a squad of results is a so important and acceptable strategy for the proposed problem. The Pareto fronts for
Pareto optimal solution analysis : Since one of the significant targets of the proposed approach is solving the multi-objective problem, then it is so important to use some criterions to authenticate the obtained Pareto optimal solutions. In this regard this paper utilizes generational distance (GD), spacing (SP) and diversity metric criterions which are described as follows: (1) Generational distance (GD) (2) Spacing (SP) (3) Diversity metric
Table 4 depicts the obtained best, worst and average of GD, SP and D -metric for proposed algorithm. From this table, it is clear that the proposed algorithm can obtain proper Pareto front, because the values of SP and GD for the proposed algorithm is less. Also the value of D -metric related to the proposed algorithm is great. This table reveals the suitability of the proposed algo-rithm in solving the multi objective problems for once again.
For surveying the decrease and increase effect of an objective function on the other objective functions, the problem is con-sidered as seven cases: in the first three and last four cases the proposed problem is solved as a single objective and multi-objective function, respectively. In each case from cases I to III one of the functions is selected as the objective function which has to be optimized and the other four cases are listed as follow: Case IV: considering both cost and loss objective functions
Case V: considering both cost and voltage deviation objective functions
Case VI: considering both loss and voltage deviation objective functions Case VII: considering all objective functions simultaneously.
The best privilege of the Pareto method is that the system operator can choose one of the obtained Pareto optimal solutions based on his/her decision. In a word system operator has a lot of choice and can select one economical and practical choice. In this regard after applying the MTLBO for producing Pareto solutions and by application of w i coefficients in which P S k  X  1 best compromised solution is selected among them as follows: N  X  where F is the number of objective function, w k is the weight factor for the k th objective functions and H is the number of non-dominated solutions. It should be noted that in Eq. (46) the summation of coefficients should be equaled to unit in a word P
In this regard Eq. (46) is calculated for all non-dominated solutions, next they are sorted based on their N m value and the best solution among them is considered as a best compromised solution.

For recognizing the differences between the multi-objective and the single objective optimization problem, more comparisons between them, according to the most preferred solution obtained by selecting the best compromised approach, are proposed in
Table 5 . According to this table, following observations can be concluded: In a comparison between caseVII-1 and case I, its observed that loss and voltage deviations values of caseVII-1(144.2806 and 2.4789 for loss and voltage deviation, respec-tively) is smaller than their related values in case I (166.2054 and 3.7919 for loss and voltage deviation, respectively) and cost function value of caseVII-1(174.5653) is more than cost function value of case I (168.6734), but this is not considered as a deficiency. Indeed the additional value of cost function in case-loss values of the system in caseVII-1. With comparison between 168 170 172 174 176 178 180

At the same time by comparing the obtained results of case IV-1, case IV-2 and case IV-3, it is obvious that by value growths much more than expected. Also, by increasing the w in case IV-3 the loss value declines and the cost value growths.
Hence, it is obvious that cost and loss objective functions conflict each other. As mentioned before, increase in DGs value leads to reduction and enhancement of loss and cost objective function
VI-1, case VI-2 and case VI-3, it is concluded that by increase of w case VI-2 the loss value diminishes and the voltage deviation value increases much more than expected. Furthermore by increasing the w 3 in case VI-3 the voltage deviation value declines and the loss value increases drastically. There fore,itisobservedthatlossand voltage deviation objective functions conflict each other. Also, by w 1 and w 3 , cost value enlarges and voltage deviation declines and this confirms above statements.

Eventually bus voltages profile is displayed in Fig. 8 for more validating of the proposed approach. In this regard, all bus voltages are shown in two states, with AVRs and DGs and without them, it is worthwhile to note that the obtained voltage of all buses in this figure related to the state that all objectives are optimized simultaneously.
 Conclusion
The optimal location and effect of the AVRs in the distribution networks at the presence of DGs has been investigated in this approach. Simulation results reveal that the AVRs and the DGs have a magnificent effect on improvement of distribution systems char-acteristics; hence applying the DGs and finding the optimal location of AVRs in distributed systems is a significant issue. Comparison between the results attained by applying the proposed algorithm (MTLBO) and other algorithms including PSO, GA and TLBO, proves that the accuracy of MTLBO is much more than other utilized algorithms. Also, the convergence velocity of the proposed algorithm is much more than those related to PSO and GA algorithms. Another important point is that the MTLBO attains these results with least iterations with respect to other algorithms. The performance of the presented method has been tested on a 70 buses test system. Yet another significant point is that the proposed approach, especially the method which helps system operator to find best compromise solution, gave important information to the decision maker for finding the optimal location of AVRs in distribution systems. The research work is under way in order to incorporate more issues include the inherent stochastic behavior of some issues in distribu-tion power systems.
