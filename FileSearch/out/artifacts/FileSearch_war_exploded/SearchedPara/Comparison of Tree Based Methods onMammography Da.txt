 X-ray film mammography and physical examination of the breast are the main-stays for early detection of breast cancer. They contribute to the improvement of survival in breast carcinoma by allowing early treatment of occult lesions. One of the most important tasks in mammography is the assessment of calcifications and 10% to 40% lesions thus identified turn out to be malignant in subsequent biopsies.
 and intervention. Other than the instrument itself, the main cost of the mammo-gram is the radiologist, who decides whether a suspicious area exists. A positive reading often leads to more expensive and invasive biopsies.
 low. The data we examined are the part of a series of 8421 mammograms [1] that entailed both false positive and false negative rates near 25%. In western coun-tries it has been reported that missed cancers (false negatives) are particularly common in pre-menopausal women due to dense and highly glandular structure of their breasts [2] [3]. They are also common among post-menopausal women on estrogen replacement therapies [4]. In day-to-day practice in the USA, mam-mograms can miss more than a quarter (28%) of all tumors [5]. Because early detection of breast cancer is so crucial to its successful treatment, a false nega-tive has serious health and cost consequences. On the other hand, false positives, (mistakenly diagnosed cancers from healthy tissue) are particularly common in the same two groups [2] [4]. A false positive can lead to needless anxiety, more X-ray exposure and unnecessary biopsies. As many as three-fourths of all post-mammogram biopsy results turn out to be non-cancerous lesions [6]. It has been estimated that the cumulative risk of false positives increases to  X  X s high as 100 percent X  over a decade of screening tests [7]. In Asian women, in whom smaller breasts result in higher density, the sensitivity of mammography is cor-respondingly lowered [8] [9]. For applicability to Asian populations of any breast cancer diagnostic system based on mammography it is therefore of interest to see whether data mining techniques may help improving interpretation accuracy for a mammogram series with high error rates of reading by experienced radiol-ogists. Providing accurate screening of breast cancer from mammograms could have a significant impact on the health and well being of women throughout the developing world.
 and the presence of malignant breast diseases. We compare several data mining techniques including classification trees (section 3), bagged and boosted trees (section 4), and neural networks (section 5). We summarize and suggest some directions for future research in section 6. The data consist of records of 1618 mammograms showing clustered microcalcifi-cations on which follow up excisions were performed. The data were provided to us by Dr. Bernard Asselain, Head of the Biostatistics Department of the Institut Curie, and by Dr. Mich` ele Le Gal, senior radiologist now retired from the same institution, who introduced in 1976 a five way classification of microcalcifications based on the probability of malignancy [10] (see Fig. 1 where type 1 to 5 denote increasing probability of malignancy). When assessing the Le Gal X  X  classification against the BI-RADS (breast imaging reporting and data system) introduced by the American College of Radiology (ACR) in 1992, G  X  uls  X  un et al. (2003, [11]) found the former to entail higher positive predictive value for types 4-5 lesions and better interradiologist agreement than the latter system. About 30% of the mammograms were obtained in the Institut Curie with a Diagnost UM dedi-cated unit (Philips Medical Systems), while 70% were obtained elsewhere with various units of equivalent quality. The film used at the Institut Curie was Ortho MA (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) with Min R screens (Eastman Kodak). Craniocaudal, lateral and oblique mediolateral views were obtained. The re-sponse variable is whether the tumor was benign or malignant as resulting from posterior histological examination. In addition, 11 other predictor variables are available:  X  two clinical variables pertaining to the patient X  X  age and the indication about  X  the main usual radiographic features, i.e., appearance of tissue density, size,  X  the clusters X  morphology according to Le Gal X  X  classification. ( [12]; Fig. 1) A tree model splits the observations into bins, defined by combinations of values on the predictor variables. It then estimates the probability of malignancy simply by calculating the proportion of malignant cases in each bin. The depth of the tree can be preselected but is usually chosen via cross-validation, by trying trees of various depths and then choosing the depth that has lowest average error across a series of test subsets.(see [15] for details) We found that using a minimum subset size of 50 was optimal for our data set. Using all the predictor variables, with a minimum subset size of 50, resulted in the tree shown in Fig. 2. ing and test sets. To compare the performance of a tree to other methods, we repeated the random splitting 1000 times, selecting 999 cases for training and 600 cases for testing each time. We report the average error rate for all methods. including the radiologists X  assessment on the same 1000 test sets in Table 1. Ensemble averaging methods have become widely used. Rather than training one tree in order to predict on a test set, we trained an ensemble of trees, selecting a bootstrapped (sampled with replacement) training set from the original training set, each time predicting on the same test set. To estimate a case in the test set, we fit each of the generated trees and take the model average prediction. This is a case of bagging or bootstrap aggregation (see [14] or [13]). We also generated each tree with a random set of predictor variables as well. In this case there are three parameters to vary: the number of trees generated, the number of predictors in each tree and the size of the tree. After some exploration, we settled on choosing 10 of the 11 predictors at random, a minimum final node size of 50 as before and 1000 trees. For the prediction, we found that rather than using the majority vote, we had lower total error using a cutoff of 30%. That is we took as predicting malignancy if 35% or more of the trees predicted malignancy. (Actually using 40% lowered the total error slightly, but raised the false negative rate significantly). The 35% rule gave error rates shown in Table 1, substantially lower than either the single tree or the radiologists.
 ging, the data are reweighted after the first tree is fit, with the observations that are misclassified given higher weights than the ones correctly classified. The model is then refit and this process is repeated many time. At the end, we have a sequence of predictions from the reweighted fits. These models are then weighted by their misclassification rates and a weighted vote is produced for each new case from the test set. (see [16], [15] and [13]).
 by Salford Systems, Treenet c and the classification errors on the test set are shown in table 1. As a contrast to tree methods, we also considered fitting multilayer feedforward neural networks. For both the hidden layer and the response, we used a sigmoidal activation function. To avoid overfitting we used weight decay, which adds a penalty term to the residual sum of squares, before minimization, choosing the weight decay parameter via cross-validation.
 justed the output so that a case was predicted to be malignant if the predicted probability of malignancy was at least 0.40, similar to the value we took for the trees. The error rates are shown in Table 1. One of the advantages of this neural network implementation is the ability to look at the generated function via a contour profiler. For this model, this is shown in Fig. 3. From the profiler, we can see the positive correlation of malignant probability on the variables age and forme quite clearly. Notice the non linear increase in risk for older women (here selected for forme = 4).
 We investigated several data mining strategies in the hopes of providing more automatic, and hence less costly diagnostic capability from mammograms. Our results indicate that bagged trees may provide a diagnostic accuracy matching or eventually better than that of radiologists. We are encouraged from our find-ings that such automatic diagnostic capability might be realized. This has the potential of providing breast cancer diagnostic/screening to developing nations at a long far less than is currently available. Further research could be conducted to assess the potential for combining these models into a committee of experts, comprised perhaps from bagged trees, boosted trees and neural networks, using the model diagnostic as a guide.
