 Semantics has many different definitions in science. In natural language processing, there has been much research over the past three decades involving extracting the semantics, the meaning, of natural texts. This has led to entity recognition (people, places, companies, prices, dates, and These techniques are now well unde rstood and robust. Results of this research are beginning to appear in products and online sites, finding their wa y into practical applications. The stage is set for an explosion of semantically sa vvy applications, from 3D design, to enhanced web browsing, to social network aware yellowpages. This talk will explore these paths from research to industry, illustrated by current products on the market.

He is also one of the pioneers of distributional semant ics, following his PhD work "Exploring Automatic Thesaurus Generation" (Kluwer, 1994). Involved in information retrieval since the early TREC days, he has always been keen on large scale so lutions to natural language processing problems, co-editing with Adam Kilgarriff a sp ecial issue of "Computational Li nguistics" in 2003. Former chief scientist at the Xerox Research Centre Europe (93-01), at Clairvoyance Corporation (01-04), and with the French CEA (04-08), he has been active in transferring research into products as inventor in 16 U.S patents. In recent y ears, he has been working with Adrian Popescu on Geographical Indexing. With Dassault Systemes, he is interested in exploring multidimensional access to information..
