 Sibson (1980) firstly introduced the concept of natural adjacency in the interpolation natural neighborhoods, that is to say, there is a natural adjacency relationship between the two spatial objects. The ability for efficiently computing natural adjacency relationship has become more and more important in an increasing number of applications including spatial data mining [6], spatial query language [1], and represented the natural adjacency relationsh ip extracted from the Voronoi diagram as spatial objects, the relationship is expressed as an edge. In this way, the extraction of (1992) adopted the Winged-Edge structure which can definitely represented the relationships among Voronoi nodes, Voronoi edges and Voronoi areas. Extracting the natural adjacency relationship based on Winged-Edge has simple querying process and doesn X  X  need extra computation. However, the Winged-Edge structure is a topology structure, which need maintain the node table, edge table and area table. So, diagram of all spatial objects and the Winged-Edge structure has to be reconstructed even if there is a small change of spatial object [3] . 
The main property of natural adjacency relation is that it isn X  X  satisfying Euclidean current spatial index methods. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we put forward a new structure-UnitsDelaunay and its constructing algorithm for describing the natural adjacency relationship based on Delaunay triangulation. Section 3 presents Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and points out future work. relationship regions. 2.1 Classification of Delaunay Triangles and UnitsDelaunay Structure boundary nodes set P . A triangle is made up of three edges and it is a simplex. If the edge is queried by points, the function f in definition 1 can be established in order to classify the edges. p p  X  p p  X  p tenable, then f ( p i , p j )=2. the three edges of the triangle. By absolute value of the formula (1) we can get 5 kinds of expression for t , the three edges come from three different spatial objects (type  X  ). Theorem 1. Triangle of type  X  doesn X  X  completely exist in areal object interior. Proof. According to the natural D2 of Delaunay introduced in [10], the triangulation n U = CH( p ),  X  Q is convex,  X  CH( p )=  X  Q . If Q is concave polygon, then CH( p ) is According to the theorem 1, the type  X  of triangles should be progressively classified. operator, which is used to judge whether Q contains b , then we can define: is false, then t  X  X  type is  X  . Theorem 2. The space scope of Q is equal to the set T  X  of all triangles of type  X  . of type  X  ,  X  and  X  . Corollary 2. The natural adjacency relationship can only exist in { T  X   X  T  X   X  T  X  }. relationship only exists among the discrete spatial objects. Corollary 2 is tenable.  X  had corresponding changes [2], [9]. The three vertices of each triangle are the natural relations with the inserted point. N  X  t then there are adj ( M , N ), adj ( M , V ), adj ( N , V ). Theorem 4. If M and N have adjacency relationship, then the querying point q which drops into the region { relationships with the spatial object M and N . Proof. The querying point drops into D ( P )\{ q  X  T  X  =  X  X  , according to the theorem 2, then ther e isn X  X  spatial objects adjacent to the and N . 
The querying point drops into { q The region { type T  X  . U , denoted as U ( P ). N adjacent spatial object. For the type T MN , we can confirm: For the type T KMN , we can confirm: 2.2 Construction Algorithm for UnitsDelaunay Structure which have shared boundaries must be consid ered in order to ensure completeness of the result. The construction algorithm of UnitsDelaunay structure: input the arrays T  X  , T and T  X  , output UnitsDelaunay ={unit 1 , ..., unit n }. Step 1: Seek the boundary nodes of arbitrary unit. T and arr 2 according to the different fid , and then perform step 2 with parameter t ''. Step 2: Generate the units based on boundary nodes. is continuous, then process is over; (3) if arr 1 isn X  X  continuous, seek the broken point ended. Step 3: Build the unit of triangle t of type  X  . (3) construct arr , ended. the time complexity of the algorithm is O ( n 3 ). In spatial database, the spatial selection method is of performance for two computing levels: filter and refinement. The filter level, which is commonly supported by spatial UnitsDelaunay structure with the spatial index, the relations between spatial selection and spatial object can be built. Thus, the line intersection computation can be applied to compute the natural adjacency relationship. 3.1 Spatial Approximation for Unit 2 and Unit 3 geometry object of a spatial object as an operated object. Approximation policy is the approximation method in spatial index for unit 2 and unit 3 . shared boundary), then PQ ( q , t  X  )  X  PQ ( q , t  X  )  X  PQ ( q , t  X  ). Definition 6. The repository of all binary relationships for querying point q is called as the closure of q , recorded as q + . Theorem 6. q + is complete. The unit 3 is composed by a triangle of type  X  . According to theorem 5 and theorem 6, in order to confirm the complete candidate set of the natural adjacency, the MBR of minimum boundary circle (MBC) is adopted as the approximate geometry object. For the unit 2 , the MBR is adopted. 3.2 Basic Structure of Quad GridFile GridFile of the cell. This can effectively use the memory and balance the CPU task; secondly, updating index structure can be completed by reconstructing GridFile structure of correlative cell region. 
The GridFile spatial index structure divides the embedded 2-Dimension space by stored in the actual data tuple structure. Experiment of proposed structure and method was carried out under Oracle 9.2.1 and (1) generating Delaunay triangular irregular network; (2) generating unitsDelaunay object boundary nodes and time for creating GridFile as shown in Fig.3. number of areal object boundary nodes ( n ), and it is represented as while the inserting, deleting and modifying operators are happen, updating operation number of boundary nodes is N, the number of Quad level is l , there is where k , b are constant and n is the relation of l and N is 4000(ms) and N is 50000, upon fitted equation substitution to (9), we can get the l = index, we analyzed test data, which got by moved point query in fixed grid form. For seven random query points, test data are shown in Table 1. 
From Table 1 we can see that, 2.42 binary relationships are stored in a bucket and geometry from Oracle is 11 (ms), and final shooting rate of GridFile is 74.18%. In this paper, we proposed a new data structure UnitsDelaunay and integrated it into strengthened in future: (1) The spatial approximation of unit 2 . The MBR of the spatial object is regarded as approximate geometry object. However, in practice we found its performance of spatial query processing can be improved by decomposing a complex object into a small number of simple components. We will consider decomposing complex unit structure with Delaunay triangulation method. (2) We also note that, the relationship and the new model of topological relation calculation based on Delaunay an interesting and meaningful work. Acknowledgments.
