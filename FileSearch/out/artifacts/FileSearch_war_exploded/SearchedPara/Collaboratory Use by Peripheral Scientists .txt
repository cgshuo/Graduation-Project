 Recent years have seen an increasing use of collaboratories in scientific work. It is hypothesized that by enabling scientists to reach remotely located data, instruments and experts, collaboratories will benefit peripheral scientists (e.g., scientists from developing countries and scientists from minority colleges in the U.S.) more than core scientists. However, previous studies on computer network use have shown mixed results regarding peripherality effects. Adopting a qualitative approach, this study intends to investigate cultural, political, and technical factors that influence collaboratory use by peripheral scientists. K.4.3 [Computers and Society]: Organizational Impacts  X  Computer-supported collaborative work Keywords: Collaboratory, scientific collaboration, peripheral scientists, interviews Contemporary science is equated with  X  X ig Science X , involving multiple researchers and institutions [7]. A recent trend in scientific collaboration has been a rapid increase of collaborations across distance and across various types of institutions. For example, Figure 1 shows that there were much more multi-institutional collaborations among U.S. scientists and between U.S. and other countries in 2001 than in 1988. Since early 1990s, collaboratories have been more and more widely adopted as facilitators of remote scientific collaboration. Wulf (1993) [9] defines a collaboratory as  X  ...a center without walls, in which the nation X  X  researchers can perform their research without regard to geographical location--interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources and accessing information in digital libraries. X  Many researchers argue that collaboratories will not only enhance the development of science, but also narrow the gap between core scientists and peripheral scientists, for example, scientists from developing countries and scientists from minority colleges in the U.S [2]. It is hypothesized that collaboratories benefit peripheral scientists by enabling them to reach remotely located instruments, databases and experts [2,4], although to date there have been no efforts to systematically collect the data to confirm or disconfirm this hypothesis. Most collaboratories have been based on and designed for the practices of scientists from major research institutes in U.S. and Western Europe. Little is known about whether they meet the needs  X  Understanding which social-technical solutions offered by different types of collaboratories are of greater benefit to peripheral scientists;  X  Advising system developers regarding what to consider when both peripheral and core scientists are involved. Since little has been known about how peripheral scientists use and are affected by collaboratories, we have adopted a qualitative approach. We are interviewing scientists and conducting field observations to observe how scientists use collaboratories. We have done 10 interviews with 2 Primary Investigators (PIs), 1 core scientist and 7 peripheral scientists. We plan to interview about 10 PIs, 50 peripheral scientists and 50 core scientists when the study is finished. Peripheral scientists in our study include scientists from minority serving institutions in the U.S. and developing countries, mainly China, Korea, India and South Africa. We are interviewing and observing the peripheral scientists who participate in three types of collaboratories included in our database of collaboratory projects (see www.scienceofcollaboratories.org). We are also interviewing PIs of different collaboratory projects and core scientists participating in the same collaboratories. We are asking peripheral scientists, core scientists and PIs about the social, cultural and technical barriers to their collaborations, benefits of collaborations by means of collaboratories, etc. We are observing how scientists perform their work, the culture and information technology infrastructure they are exposed to, etc. Infrastructure problems . A professor in a historically black college mentioned the poor facilities in his lab; a scientist mentioned that  X  X here is often quite good networking to third world countries, at least arriving at the coast through the cable. The problems tend to be to get it from there to where the institutes are. X  Cultural differences . A scientist in Europe mentioned that  X  X ots of our collaborators (in some developing countries) are more used to working in a structured way, which doesn X  X  suit research. X  Trust . A PI in the U.S. mentioned that collaboration in science often requires exchanging materials, e.g. reagents. It is hard to know what happens to the materials when they are sent to other countries. They are not sure whether they are used by some other labs not included in the collaboratories. Coordination. The principle of some collaboratories is that everybody tells everybody else what they are doing and their research methodology so that scientists can learn from each other.
