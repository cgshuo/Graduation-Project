 Nowadays, patient monitors are widely used to capture patients physiological signals and vital signs in ICU. A lot of patients physiological data can be ob-tained. Since complex activity recognition has been rather possible [1], it is also possible to recognize certain peoples diseases through their corresponding phys-iological data. In this paper, a proper length of a series physiological signal data points that is clustered from each signal of each disease is called atomic pattern. A series of physiological signal is a collection of temporally consecutive atomic patterns. A disease is assigned by the collection of unique occurrence frequen-cy of atomic pattern pairs from two physiological signals with certain temporal dependency. One disease can be found from several sets of atomic pattern com-binations and their temporal relations. Repetitive atomic patterns can also exist in one combination related to certain disease.
 pendencies between atomic patterns from two physiological signals, but also rep-resent the uncertainties corresponding to individual atomic patterns and their temporal dependencies. Its known that di erent individuals that have the same disease may possess a unique set of physiological signals, which are obviously di erent from the others. This kind of variability of diseases often shows them-selves by the types of underlying atomic patterns and the temporal dependencies that exists between them.
 applied on medical series physiological data. Sacchi et al. presents a knowledge-based model to mine rules in temporal biomedical data [2]. J.He et al. proposed a multivariate association rule mining based on change detection for complex dataset including numerical data streams [3]. Mudlikhah et al. present an ap-proach using fuzzy inference and subtractive clustering to mine rule of certain disease from linguistic data [4]. H.Banaee et al. present a fully data-driven ap-proach which is based on Allen interval relations to extract and represent tem-poral relation of atomic patterns in clinical data streams and make a textual output [5]. The knowledge-based models are restricted by the knowledge of do-main experts. The methods above are all less expressive to depict the uncertain-ties associated with the temporal dependencies. The interval temporal Bayesian network is an e ective interval based graphic model that combines probability and Allens relation to recognize complex activities [6]. However, it cant handle repetitive atomic patterns within one disease. 2.1 Interval Relation Description The model we introduced in this paper is Probabilistic Interval-Based Bayesian Model with Allen's relations. Given dataset D of K records over F diseases. Each record consists of atomic pattern interval sequences of several physiological mea-between the patterns of a record are described by Allen's relations. Allen provides 13 possible temporal relations between two intervals. They are before , meets , by , during and nishes , denoted as { b; m; o; s; c; f; ; b ; m ; o ; s ; c ; f } [7]. In this work we describe the temporal relations using the subtext of Allens rela-tions { b; m; o; s; c; f;  X } . Temporal relationships between atomic patterns within a disease can be represented by an interval network. In the network, an interval is represented by a node, the Allens temporal relationship between two involved intervals is represented by a directed link. Only one temporal relation is associ-ated to one such link, which is in { b; m; o; s; c; f;  X } . A directed cyclic graph is resulted, and the temporal relations corresponded to links shall be consistent. For example, p 1 starts p 2 and p 2 meets p 3 , the temporal relation on the link between p 1 and p 3 is before . The necessary and sucient condition for an in-terval network is that the temporal relations on every pattern triangle satis es transitivity properties.
 be shown as several appearances which can be represented by the probabilistic interval-based networks where atomic patterns and the temporal relations are composed di erently. We want to build a model which can automatically con-struct the interval-based networks to characterize a disease.

P 1 ; P 2 ; P 3 ; :::; P Q For each disease f (1  X  f  X  F ) , denote D f which belongs to D the corresponding subset of K f records. Each record f  X  D f is an example of the f -th disease. Denote the quantity of intervals in the record f as | f | . Denote the network nodes. In the network, each nodes is assigned with an atomic pattern in P , each edge is assigned with a relation in R . In our model, edges are generated only between two neighboring nodes. Therefore, a network G f consists of | f | nodes v 2.2 Temporal Relations on Edges The relation on edge e f;m 1 ;m is chosen following Multinomial ( i;j ) from the relations in R (1  X  i &lt; j  X  m  X  1). Each pair of atomic patterns ( P i ; P j ) is set with a multinomial distribution parameter vector i;j . It can be known that relation r f;i;j only depends on two atomic patterns, P i and P j . Maximum Likelihood Etimation( MLE ) is used to learn the parameter vectors from dataset D f . According to MLE , the likelihood of P i ;P j given dataset D f is relation r appears between P i and P j . The maximum likelihood estimation for 2.3 Node Generation We used latent tables drawing from Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Chinese Restaurant Process . A restaurant contains a possibly in nite number of tables. Each node is assigned to a table. Each table contains Q atomic patterns with certain probabilities. Each atomic pattern has di erent probabilities on di erent tables. We assume nodes from the records of the same disease tend to be assigned to a group of tables where the atomic patterns relating to the disease have higher probabilities. The general process of a node choosing a table is as follows. The rst node always choose the rst table with probability 1. The following m -th node choose a table following the distribution below: (if choose an occupied table) (if choose an empty table) is a tuning parameter which is positive. The node assignments to unoccupied tables are exchangeable and share the same probability in the distribution. Ac-cording to Dirichlet Process, we set every table with di erent probabilities over those Q atomic patterns. Now, a disease can be characterized by a exclusive set of tables and their distributions over the Q atomic patters. Each node v f;m choose a table following CRP ( ) as previously stated. When a node is assigned to a table t j ( j =1,2,...), an atomic pattern is chosen following the multinomial distribution Multinomial ( j ) to assign to the node. j is obtained from the a priori distribution Dirichlet ( ), of which is a hyperparameter. We set the maximum number of tables as z . Give each table a Dirichlet Distribution pa-rameter vector g (1  X  g  X  z ). Therefore, Dirichlet ( )= { Dirichlet ( 1 ), Dirich-let ( g ),..., Dirichlet ( z ) } .
 approximate inference, using Gibbs Sampling as the method. After calculating the probability of assigning each node of the graph to each table, and sampling with the available tables, the distribution of j;q (1  X  j  X  z ) is estimated as 3.1 Dataset The database used in this paper is MIMIC 2. The MIMIC II Waveform Database contains records of numeric time series of physiological signals and physiologic waves [8]. Each record belongs to one subject. The clinical information of each subject can be found in the related clinical database, including the disease that the subject is diagnosed as. In this experiment, ve physiological signals are chosen to be analyzed. They are HP (heart rate), ABP(arterial blood pressure), PULSE, RESP, SpO2(oxygen saturation). We choose the records that contain minute-by-minute numeric time series of variant physiological signals. The con-sidered disease are angina, heart failure, and brain damage. The chosen records are of the subjects who are diagnosed as one of the diseases above. The infor-mation of the chosen records is listed in table 1. We faced some challenges using clinical records in the MIMIC 2 database. Some of the raw data is incomplete, abnormal and sparse. To deal with the challenges [9], we preprocessed the records we chose before analyzing. The process includes discarding abnormal data points and smoothing time series data.
 3.2 Experimental preparation Segmentation In order to relate each time series to a corresponding atomic pattern sequence [10], segmentation method is rst being applied. In the exper-iment, the length of each segment is set to 20. Each time series of HP, ABP, PULSE, RESP and SpO2 of every chosen record is segmented. In segmented time series, the segments are placed head to tail without overlap.
 Clustering In this work, K-means and Euclidean Distance are used to cluster the obtained segments. Segmented sequence of each signal is clustered for prop-er number of cluster centers which are treated as atomic patterns [11]. In the sequence of segments, each segment is replaced with the nearest cluster center. The corresponding atomic pattern sequence of each time series is obtained.Fig.1 and Fig.2 show two atomic patterns of heart rate signal among all diseases. 3.3 Experimental results Table 2 shows precision, recall and F1-Measure results over 2-fold cross-validations. The average accuracy is 0.3571. The precision of the second disease (HF) is rel-atively high and up to 0.375. In this paper, we introduced a Probabilistic Interval-Based Bayesian Model where Allen's relations are used to depict the relations between two intervals within signals of diseases. The potential exists in our method for disease recog-nition. The biggest factor that lowered the levels of our experimental results is clustering. The clustering method we used is more adapted to cluster low-dimension data. However, its not very suitable to cluster high-dimension time series data. Our future work is to further research better methods for clustering time series data.
