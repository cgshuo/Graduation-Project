 How is language influenced by the speaker X  X  so-ciocultural identity? Quantitative sociolinguistics usually addresses this question through carefully crafted studies that correlate individual demographic attributes and linguistic variables X  X or example, the interaction between income and the  X  X ropped r X  fea-ture of the New York accent (Labov, 1966). But such studies require the knowledge to select the  X  X ropped r X  and the speaker X  X  income, from thou-sands of other possibilities. In this paper, we present a method to acquire such patterns from raw data. Us-ing multi-output regression with structured sparsity, our method identifies a small subset of lexical items that are most influenced by demographics, and dis-covers conjunctions of demographic attributes that are especially salient for lexical variation.
Sociolinguistic associations are difficult to model, because the space of potentially relevant interactions is large and complex. On the linguistic side there are thousands of possible variables, even if we limit ourselves to unigram lexical features. On the demo-graphic side, the interaction between demographic attributes is often non-linear: for example, gender may negate or amplify class-based language differ-ences (Zhang, 2005). Thus, additive models which assume that each demographic attribute makes a lin-ear contribution are inadequate.

In this paper, we explore the large space of po-tential sociolinguistic associations using structured sparsity. We treat the relationship between language and demographics as a set of multi-input, multi-output regression problems. The regression coeffi-cients are arranged in a matrix, with rows indicating predictors and columns indicating outputs. We ap-ply a composite regularizer that drives entire rows of the coefficient matrix to zero, yielding compact, interpretable models that reuse features across dif-ferent outputs. If we treat the lexical frequencies as inputs and the author X  X  demographics as outputs, the induced sparsity pattern reveals the set of lexi-cal items that is most closely tied to demographics. If we treat the demographic attributes as inputs and build a model to predict the text, we can incremen-tally construct a conjunctive feature space of demo-graphic attributes, capturing key non-linear interac-tions.
The primary purpose of this research is ex-ploratory data analysis to identify both the most linguistic-salient demographic features, and the most demographically-salient words. However, this model also enables predictions about demographic features by analyzing raw text, potentially support-ing applications in targeted information extraction or advertising. On the task of predicting demo-graphics from text, we find that our sparse model yields performance that is statistically indistinguish-able from the full vocabulary, even with a reduction in the model complexity an order of magnitude. On the task of predicting text from author demograph-ics, we find that our incrementally constructed fea-ture set obtains significantly better perplexity than a linear model of demographic attributes. Our dataset is derived from prior work in which we gathered the text and geographical locations of 9,250 microbloggers on the website twitter. com (Eisenstein et al., 2010). Bloggers were se-lected from a pool of frequent posters whose mes-sages include metadata indicating a geographical lo-cation within a bounding box around the continen-tal United States. We limit the vocabulary to the 5,418 terms which are used by at least 40 authors; no stoplists are applied, as the use of standard or non-standard orthography for stopwords (e.g., to vs. 2 ) may convey important information about the author. The dataset includes messages during the first week of March 2010.
 graphic statistics for these data by mapping geoloca-tions to publicly-available data from the U. S. Cen-sus ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA). 1 There are 33,178 such areas in the USA (the 9,250 mi-crobloggers in our dataset occupy 3,458 unique ZC-TAs), and they are designed to contain roughly equal numbers of inhabitants and demographically-homogeneous populations. The demographic at-tributes that we consider in this paper are shown in Table 1. All attributes are based on self-reports. The race and ethnicity attributes are not mutually exclusive X  X ndividuals can indicate any number of races or ethnicities. The  X  X ther language X  attribute aggregates all languages besides English and Span-ish.  X  X rban areas X  refer to sets of census tracts or census blocks which contain at least 2,500 residents; our  X % urban X  attribute is the percentage of individ-uals in each ZCTA who are listed as living in an ur-ban area. We also consider the percentage of indi-viduals who live with their families, the percentage who live in rented housing, and the median reported income in each ZCTA.

While geographical aggregate statistics are fre-quently used to proxy for individual socioeconomic status in research areas such as public health (e.g., Rushton, 2008), it is clear that interpretation must proceed with caution. Consider an author from a ZIP code in which 60% of the residents are Hispanic: 2 we do not know the likelihood that the author is His-panic, because the set of Twitter users is not a rep-resentative sample of the overall population. Polling research suggests that users of both Twitter (Smith and Rainie, 2010) and geolocation services (Zick-uhr and Smith, 2010) are much more diverse with respect to age, gender, race and ethnicity than the general population of Internet users. Nonetheless, at present we can only use aggregate statistics to make inferences about the geographic communities in which our authors live, and not the authors them-selves. The selection of both words and demographic fea-tures can be framed in terms of multi-output regres-sion with structured sparsity. To select the lexical indicators that best predict demographics, we con-struct a regression problem in which term frequen-cies are the predictors and demographic attributes are the outputs; to select the demographic features that predict word use, this arrangement is reversed. Through structured sparsity, we learn models in which entire sets of coefficients are driven to zero; this tells us which words and demographic features can safely be ignored.

This section describes the model and implemen-tation for output-regression with structured sparsity; in Section 4 and 5 we give the details of its applica-tion to select terms and demographic features. For-mally, we consider the linear equation Y = XB + , where,  X  Y is the dependent variable matrix, with di- X  X is the independent variable matrix, with di- X  B is the matrix of regression coefficients, with  X  is a N  X  T matrix in which each element is
We would like to solve the unconstrained opti-mization problem, where || A || 2 F indicates the squared Frobenius norm P on the regression coefficients B . Ridge regres-sion applies the ` 2 norm R ( B ) = P T t =1 q P P p b 2 pt and lasso regression applies the ` 1 norm R ( B ) = P compose the multi-output regression problem, treat-ing each output dimension separately. However, our working hypothesis is that there will be substantial correlations across both the vocabulary and the de-mographic features X  X or example, a demographic feature such as the percentage of Spanish speakers will predict a large set of words. Our goal is to select a small set of predictors yielding good performance across all output dimensions. Thus, we desire struc-tured sparsity, in which entire rows of the coefficient matrix B are driven to zero.

Structured sparsity is not achieved by the lasso X  X  ` 1 norm. The lasso gives element-wise sparsity, in which many entries of B are driven to zero, but each predictor may have a non-zero value for some output dimension. To drive entire rows of B to zero, we re-quire a composite regularizer. We consider the ` 1 ,  X  norm, which is the sum of `  X  norms across output dimensions: R ( B ) = P T t max p b pt (Turlach et al., 2005). This norm, which corresponds to a multi-output lasso regression, has the desired property of driving entire rows of B to zero. 3.1 Optimization There are several techniques for solving the ` 1 ,  X  normalized regression, including interior point methods (Turlach et al., 2005) and projected gradi-ent (Duchi et al., 2008; Quattoni et al., 2009). We choose the blockwise coordinate descent approach of Liu et al. (2009) because it is easy to implement and efficient: the time complexity of each iteration is independent of the number of samples. 3
Due to space limitations, we defer to Liu et al. (2009) for a complete description of the algorithm. However, we note two aspects of our implementa-tion which are important for natural language pro-cessing applications. The algorithm X  X  efficiency is accomplished by precomputing the matrices C =  X  X
T  X  Y and D =  X  X T  X  X , where  X  X and  X  Y are the stan-dardized versions of X and Y , obtained by subtract-ing the mean and scaling by the variance. Explicit mean correction would destroy the sparse term fre-quency data representation and render us unable to store the data in memory; however, we can achieve the same effect by computing C = X T Y  X  N  X  x T  X  y , where  X  x and  X  y are row vectors indicating the means of X and Y respectively. 4 We can similarly compute D = X T X  X  N  X  x T  X  x .

If the number of predictors is too large, it may not be possible to store the dense matrix D in mem-ory. We have found that approximation based on the truncated singular value decomposition provides an effective trade-off of time for space. Specifically, we compute X T X  X 
Lower truncation levels are less accurate, but are faster and require less space: for K singular val-ues, the storage cost is O ( KP ) , instead of O ( P 2 ) ; the time cost increases by a factor of K . This ap-proximation was not necessary in the experiments presented here, although we have found that it per-forms well as long as the regularizer is not too close to zero. 3.2 Regularization The regularization constant  X  can be computed us-ing cross-validation. As  X  increases, we reuse the previous solution of B for initialization; this  X  X arm start X  trick can greatly accelerate the computation of the overall regularization path (Friedman et al., 2010). At each  X  i , we solve the sparse multi-output regression; the solution B i defines a sparse set of predictors for all tasks.

We then use this limited set of predictors to con-struct a new input matrix  X  X i , which serves as the input in a standard ridge regression, thus refitting the model. The tuning set performance of this re-gression is the score for  X  i . Such post hoc refitting is often used in tandem with the lasso and related sparse methods; the effectiveness of this procedure has been demonstrated in both theory (Wasserman and Roeder, 2009) and practice (Wu et al., 2010). The regularization parameter of the ridge regression is determined by internal cross-validation. Sparse multi-output regression can be used to select a subset of vocabulary items that are especially in-dicative of demographic and geographic differences. Starting from the regression problem (1), the predic-tors X are set to the term frequencies, with one col-umn for each word type and one row for each author in the dataset. The outputs Y are set to the ten demo-graphic attributes described in Table 1 (we consider much larger demographic feature spaces in the next section) The ` 1 ,  X  regularizer will drive entire rows of the coefficient matrix B to zero, eliminating all demographic effects for many words. 4.1 Quantitative Evaluation We evaluate the ability of lexical features to predict the demographic attributes of their authors (as prox-ied by the census data from the author X  X  geograph-ical area). The purpose of this evaluation is to as-sess the predictive ability of the compact subset of lexical items identified by the multi-output lasso, as compared with the full vocabulary. In addition, this evaluation establishes a baseline for performance on the demographic prediction task.

We perform five-fold cross-validation, using the multi-output lasso to identify a sparse feature set in the training data. We compare against several other dimensionality reduction techniques, match-ing the number of features obtained by the multi-output lasso at each fold. First, we compare against a truncated singular value decomposition, with the truncation level set to the number of terms selected by the multi-output lasso; this is similar in spirit to vector-based lexical semantic techniques (Sch  X  utze and Pedersen, 1993). We also compare against sim-ply selecting the N most frequent terms, and the N terms with the greatest variance in frequency across authors. Finally, we compare against the complete set of all 5,418 terms. As before, we perform post hoc refitting on the training data using a standard ridge regression. The regularization constant for the ridge regression is identified using nested five-fold cross validation within the training set.

We evaluate on the refit models on the heldout test folds. The scoring metric is Pearson X  X  correla-tion coefficient between the predicted and true de-dicating the covariance and  X  y indicating the stan-dard deviation. On this metric, a perfect predictor will score 1 and a random predictor will score 0. We report the average correlation across all ten demo-graphic attributes, as well as the individual correla-tions.
 Results Table 2 shows the correlations obtained by regressions performed on a range of different vo-cabularies, averaged across all five folds. Linguistic features are best at predicting race, ethnicity, lan-guage, and the proportion of renters; the other de-mographic attributes are more difficult to predict. Among feature sets, the highest average correlation is obtained by the full vocabulary, but the multi-output lasso obtains nearly identical performance using a feature set that is an order of magnitude smaller. Applying the Fischer transformation, we find that all correlations are statistically significant at p &lt; . 001 .

The Fischer transformation can also be used to estimate 95% confidence intervals around the cor-relations. The extent of the confidence intervals varies slightly across attributes, but all are tighter than  X  0 . 02 . We find that the multi-output lasso and the full vocabulary regression are not significantly different on any of the attributes. Thus, the multi-output lasso achieves a 93% compression of the fea-ture set without a significant decrease in predictive performance. The multi-output lasso yields higher correlations than the other dimensionality reduction techniques on all of the attributes; these differences are statistically significant in many X  X ut not all X  cases. The correlations for each attribute are clearly not independent, so we do not compare the average across attributes.

Recall that the regularization coefficient was cho-sen by nested cross-validation within the training set; the average number of features selected is 394 . 6 . Figure 1 shows the performance of each dimensionality-reduction technique across the reg-ularization path for the first of five cross-validation folds. Computing the truncated SVD of a sparse ma-trix at very large truncation levels is computationally expensive, so we cannot draw the complete perfor-mance curve for this method. The multi-output lasso dominates the alternatives, obtaining a particularly strong advantage with very small feature sets. This demonstrates its utility for identifying interpretable models which permit qualitative analysis. 4.2 Qualitative Analysis For a qualitative analysis, we retrain the model on the full dataset, and tune the regularization to iden-tify a compact set of 69 features. For each identified term, we apply a significance test on the relationship between the presence of each term and the demo-graphic indicators shown in the columns of the ta-ble. Specifically, we apply the Wald test for compar-ing the means of independent samples, while mak-ing the Bonferroni correction for multiple compar-isons (Wasserman, 2003). The use of sparse multi-output regression for variable selection increases the power of post hoc significance testing, because the Bonferroni correction bases the threshold for sta-tistical significance on the total number of compar-isons. We find 275 associations at the p &lt; . 05 level; at the higher threshold required by a Bonferroni cor-rection for comparisons among all terms in the vo-cabulary, 69 of these associations would have been missed.

Table 3 shows the terms identified by our model which have a significant correlation with at least one of the demographic indicators. We divide words in the list into categories, which order alphabetically by the first word in each category: emoticons; stan-dard English, defined as words with Wordnet entries; proper names; abbreviations; non-English words; non-standard words used with English. The cate-gorization was based on the most frequent sense in an informal analysis of our data. A glossary of non-standard terms is given in Table 4.
 Some patterns emerge from Table 3. Standard English words tend to appear in areas with more English speakers; predictably, Spanish words tend to appear in areas with Spanish speakers and His-panics. Emoticons tend to be used in areas with many Hispanics and few African Americans. Ab-breviations (e.g., lmaoo ) have a nearly uniform demographic profile, displaying negative correla-tions with whites and English speakers, and posi-tive correlations with African Americans, Hispanics, renters, Spanish speakers, and areas classified as ur-ban.

Many non-standard English words (e.g., dats ) appear in areas with high proportions of renters, African Americans, and non-English speakers, though a subset ( haha , hahaha , and yep ) display the opposite demographic pattern. Many of these non-standard words are phonetic transcriptions of standard words or phrases: that X  X   X  dats , what X  X  up  X  wassup , I X  X  going to  X  ima . The relationship between these transcriptions and the phonological characteristics of dialects such as African-American Vernacular English is a topic for future work. Next, we demonstrate how to select conjunctions of demographic features that predict text. Again, we apply multi-output regression, but now we reverse the direction of inference: the predictors are demo-graphic features, and the outputs are term frequen-cies. The sparsity-inducing ` 1 ,  X  norm will select a subset of demographic features that explain the term frequencies.

We create an initial feature set f (0) ( X ) by bin-ning each demographic attribute, using five equal-frequency bins. We then constructive conjunctive features by applying a procedure inspired by related work in computational biology, called  X  X creen and Clean X  (Wu et al., 2010). On iteration i :  X  Solve the sparse multi-output regression prob- X  Select a subset of features S ( i ) such that m  X   X  Create a new feature set f ( i +1) ( X ) , including
We iterate this process to create features that con-join as many as three attributes. In addition to the binned versions of the demographic attributes de-scribed in Table 1, we include geographical infor-mation. We built Gaussian mixture models over the locations, with 3, 5, 8, 12, 17, and 23 components. For each author we include the most likely cluster assignment in each of the six mixture models. For efficiency, the outputs Y are not set to the raw term frequencies; instead we compute a truncated sin-gular value decomposition of the term frequencies W  X  UVD T , and use the basis U . We set the trun-cation level to 100 . 5.1 Quantitative Evaluation The ability of the induced demographic features to predict text is evaluated using a traditional perplex-ity metric. The same test and training split is used from the vocabulary experiments. We construct a language model from the induced demographic fea-tures by training a multi-output ridge regression, which gives a matrix  X  B that maps from demographic features to term frequencies across the entire vocab-ulary. For each document in the test set, the  X  X aw X  predicted language model is  X  y d = f ( x d ) B , which is then normalized. The probability mass assigned to unseen words is determined through nested cross-validation. We compare against a baseline language model obtained from the training set, again using nested cross-validation to set the probability of un-seen terms.

Results are shown in Table 5. The language mod-els induced from demographic data yield small but statistically significant improvements over the base-line (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p &lt; . 001 ). More-over, the model based on conjunctive features signif-icantly outperforms the model constructed from raw attributes ( p &lt; . 001 ). 5.2 Features Discovered Our approach discovers 37 conjunctive features, yielding the results shown in Table 5. We sort all features by frequency, and manually select a sub-set to display in Table 6. Alongside each feature, we show the words with the highest and lowest log-odds ratios with respect to the feature. Many of these terms are non-standard; while space does not permit a complete glossary, some are defined in Table 4 or in our earlier work (Eisenstein et al., 2010).
In general, geography was a strong predictor, ap-pearing in 25 of the 37 conjunctions. Features 1 and 2 (F1 and F2) are purely geographical, captur-ing the northeastern United States and the New York City area. The geographical area of F2 is completely contained by F1; the associated terms are thus very similar, but by having both features, the model can distinguish terms which are used in northeastern ar-eas outside New York City, as well as terms which are especially likely in New York. 5
Several features conjoin geography with demo-graphic attributes. For example, F9 further refines the New York City area by focusing on communities that have relatively low numbers of Spanish speak-ers; F17 emphasizes New York neighborhoods that have very high numbers of African Americans and few speakers of languages other than English and Spanish. The regression model can use these fea-tures in combination to make fine-grained distinc-tions about the differences between such neighbor-hoods. Outside New York, we see that F4 combines a broad geographic area with attributes that select at least moderate levels of minorities and fewer renters (a proxy for areas that are less urban), while F15 identifies West Coast communities with large num-bers of speakers of languages other than English and Spanish.

Race and ethnicity appear in 28 of the 37 con-junctions. The attribute indicating the proportion of African Americans appeared in 22 of these features, strongly suggesting that African American Vernac-ular English (Rickford, 1999) plays an important role in social media text. Many of these features conjoined the proportion of African Americans with geographical features, identifying local linguistic styles used predominantly in either African Amer-ican or white communities. Among features which focus on minority communities, F17 emphasizes the New York area, F33 focuses on the San Francisco Bay area, and F12 selects a broad area in the Mid-west and South. Conversely, F23 selects areas with very few African Americans and Spanish-speakers in the western part of the United States, and F36 se-lects for similar demographics in the area of Wash-ington and Philadelphia.
 Other features conjoined the proportion of African Americans with the proportion of Hispan-ics and/or Spanish speakers. In some cases, features selected for high proportions of both African Amer-icans and Hispanics; for example, F7 seems to iden-tify a general  X  X rban minority X  group, emphasizing renters, African Americans, and Spanish speakers. Other features differentiate between African Ameri-cans and Hispanics: F8 identifies regions with many Spanish speakers and Hispanics, but few African Americans; F20 identifies regions with both Span-ish speakers and whites, but few African Americans. F8 and F20 tend to emphasize more Spanish words than features which select for both African Ameri-cans and Hispanics.

While race, geography, and language predom-inate, the socioeconomic attributes appear in far fewer features. The most prevalent attribute is the proportion of renters, which appears in F4 and F7, and in three other features not shown here. This at-tribute may be a better indicator of the urban/rural divide than the  X % urban X  attribute, which has a very low threshold for what counts as urban (see Table 1). It may also be a better proxy for wealth than median income, which appears in only one of the thirty-seven selected features. Overall, the se-lected features tend to include attributes that are easy to predict from text (compare with Table 2). Sociolinguistics has a long tradition of quantitative and computational research. Logistic regression has been used to identify relationships between demo-graphic features and linguistic variables since the 1970s (Cedergren and Sankoff, 1974). More re-cent developments include the use of mixed factor models to account for idiosyncrasies of individual speakers (Johnson, 2009), as well as clustering and multidimensional scaling (Nerbonne, 2009) to en-able aggregate inference across multiple linguistic variables. However, all of these approaches assume that both the linguistic indicators and demographic attributes have already been identified by the re-searcher. In contrast, our approach focuses on iden-tifying these indicators automatically from data. We view our approach as an exploratory complement to more traditional analysis.

There is relatively little computational work on identifying speaker demographics. Chang et al. (2010) use U.S. Census statistics about the ethnic distribution of last names as an anchor in a latent-variable model that infers the ethnicity of Facebook users; however, their paper analyzes social behav-ior rather than language use. In unpublished work, David Bamman uses geotagged Twitter text and U.S. Census statistics to estimate the age, gender, and racial distributions of various lexical items. 6 Eisen-stein et al. (2010) infer geographic clusters that are coherent with respect to both location and lexical distributions; follow-up work by O X  X onnor et al. (2010) applies a similar generative model to demo-graphic data. The model presented here differs in two key ways: first, we use sparsity-inducing regu-larization to perform variable selection; second, we eschew high-dimensional mixture models in favor of a bottom-up approach of building conjunctions of demographic and geographic attributes. In a mix-ture model, each component must define a distribu-tion over all demographic variables, which may be difficult to estimate in a high-dimensional setting.
Early examples of the use of sparsity in natu-ral language processing include maximum entropy classification (Kazama and Tsujii, 2003), language modeling (Goodman, 2004), and incremental pars-ing (Riezler and Vasserman, 2004). These papers all apply the standard lasso, obtaining sparsity for a sin-gle output dimension. Structured sparsity has rarely been applied to language tasks, but Duh et al. (2010) reformulated the problem of reranking N -best lists as multi-task learning with structured sparsity. This paper demonstrates how regression with struc-tured sparsity can be applied to select words and conjunctive demographic features that reveal soci-olinguistic associations. The resulting models are compact and interpretable, with little cost in accu-racy. In the future we hope to consider richer lin-guistic models capable of identifying multi-word ex-pressions and syntactic variation.
