 This paper proposes a novel Geo-IR ranking method that realizes effective searches that emphasize the user X  X  imme-diate surroundings. It assesses the extent implied by place names in documents and then emphasizes place names that are highly specific in terms of identifying locations.

Geographic Information Retrieval (Geo-IR, GIR) is a re-search area that aims at locating documents that deal with specified areas through not only keyword constraints but also geographic constraints. We aim at a GIR system that can introduce to us information about shops or services in our immediate surroundings via mobile communication de-vices.

Unfortunately, existing methods target only relatively broad geographic queries, for example country or region, as rep-resented by GeoCLEF tasks[3]. For example, one method uses the area that encompasses all place names in a docu-ment as the geographic scope of the document[1]. In another method, if two documents contain an area that is specified by a query, they will be treated equally, even if one document implies a wide area and the other implies a more focused area[5]. Accordingly, conventional methods face several bar-riers to realizing accurate searches that focus on small areas.
To address this problem, we propose a ranking algorithm that considers the extents implied by place names. This method assigns higher scores to documents that contain place names that offer restricted areas references than those that contain place names implying wide areas.
 Index preparation. The system requires a text index and a geographic index. As the text index, those created for existing full-text search can be used. The geographic in-dex is made by using geo-parser, which locates place name expressions in texts as geo-references and geo-coder, which assigns coordinates to each geo-reference[2]. The geographic index also includes the extent of each geo-reference, which is extracted from a location name dictionary.
 Runtime procedure. The system accepts a query con-sisting of a content query, Qc , and a geographic query, Qg . The former is represented by keywords as in existing full-text search, and the latter is represented by coordinates Qg p resenting center of interest and maximum allowed distance Qg d . We assume that Qg p is given by GPS or location infor-mation from the mobile station. We also assume that Qg d is defined according to the transportation mode. For example, if the user is on foot, the maximum allowed distance is set at a small value (say 1 kilometer), if driving, the value is set at a relatively large value (say 20 kilometers).

After accepting a query, the system first collects docu-ments that contain at least one geo-reference whose coordi-nates lie inside the geographic query. It then calculates a document score for each document based on the geographic score and the content score. As the content score, any of the conventional scoring methods can be used such as tf-idf or BM25. The geographic score is calculated from the geo-reference score as described below.
 Geo-reference score. The geo-reference score for the i -th geo-reference w i is defined using 1) distance from the query and 2) weight discounting term based on the extent of the geo-reference.

The distance between w i and Qg is defined as follows: dist ( w i , Qg ) =
Here d inner is a constant and d edge ( w i , Qg ) is the shortest distance from the edge of w i  X  X  extent.

We define the weight discounting term as proportional to the inverse of w i  X  X  extent e i . By using this, we define the geo-reference score as follows: Document score. The geographic score of document D n is defined as the sum of the geo-reference scores of the geo-references in the document: Geo: position: Shinjuku, Sakae, Umeda,
Qg Qg p Sannomiya, Hacchobori, Tenjin
Finally, a document score is defined as the weighted prod-uct of content score and the above-described geographic score as follows:.

Here,  X  is a constant that balances content score against geographic score. For our evaluation, we use the full text search engine with BM25 ranking as the basic retrieval system and Hirano X  X  method[4] for geo-parsing and geo-coding. The extent of each address is extracted from a Japanese gazetteer 1 . We used Japanese blog documents of a blog service provider as the test collection 2 . This collection consists of documents whose main topic was set by the author as  X  X ating experi-ence X  or  X  X ocal topic X . The collection holds about 300,000 documents written by 18,565 authors. 64 search topics were defined by combining the queries shown in Table 1. Each search topic assumed that the user who walk while carrying location-aware mobile phone was searching for nearby shops or services.

To create the relevance judgment using above collection and topics, we pooled the result set for each topic. Each result set consisted of the top 50 search results from all sys-tems used in the evaluation. Total pool size is 4493. Each result set was evaluated by three subjects. Evaluation ba-sis is shown in Table 2; we regarded results with scores of over 1 as relevant results. If the subjects output different relevance judgments, the judgment was decided by major-ity vote. The rate at which the three subjects set the same score was 83.9% (3769/4493). available at http://nlftp.mlit.go.jp/isj/ http://blog.goo.ne.jp/ System MAP R-prec Recall P@5 P@10 Prop 0.4290  X  0.4459  X  0.7485  X  0.5688 0.5016  X  Kwd 0.3316 0.3794 0.4745 0.5688 0.4547 Mindst 0.3719 0.4118 0.6609 0.5437 0.4516 Intrsec 0.2296 0.2765 0.5908 0.2844 0.2734 Asterisks indicate significant improvement from Mindst (Wilcoxon sined rank test, p &lt; 0.05)
This evaluation compares the proposed method ( Prop ) to the following three baseline methods.
 Kwd : Uses conventional full-text search system. Central position name is used as the geographic query.
 Mindst : Replaces the geographic score with the score based on just the distance between the center of the geographic query and the nearest geo-reference in the document. Intrsec : Ranks the documents, that have at least one geo-reference whose central position is within the area indicated by the geographic query, by BM25 with content query.
Figure 1 plots the recall-precision curve and it shows that the proposed method yields the highest precision at most recall levels. Table 3 shows several types of results and it also indicates that the proposed method yields superior scores for all metrics.
This paper proposed a ranking method for GIR. It offers highly accurate searches when accessing information about things within relatively small areas; its performance is su-perior to that of a conventional method.
