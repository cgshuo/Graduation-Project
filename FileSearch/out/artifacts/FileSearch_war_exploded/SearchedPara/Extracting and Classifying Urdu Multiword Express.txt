 Multiword expressions ( MWE s) are expressions which can be semantically and syntactically idiosyn-cratic in nature; acting as a single unit, their mean-ing is not always predictable from their components. Their identification is therefore an important task for any Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) application that goes beyond the analysis of pure surface struc-ture, in particular for languages with few other NLP tools available.

There is a vast amount of literature on extract-ing and classifying MWE s automatically; many ap-proaches rely on already available resources that aid during the acquisition process. In the case of the Indo-Aryan language Urdu, a lack of linguistic re-sources such as annotated corpora or lexical knowl-edge bases impedes the task of detecting and classi-fying MWE s. Nevertheless, statistical measures and language-specific syntactic information can be em-ployed to extract and classify MWE s.

Therefore, the method described in this paper can partly overcome the bottleneck of resource sparsity, despite the relatively small size of the available cor-pus and the simplistic approach taken. With the help of heuristics as to the occurrence of Urdu MWE s with characteristic postpositions and other cues, it is pos-sible to cluster the MWE s into two groups: locations and person names. It is also possible to detect junk MWE s. The classification is then evaluated against a hand-annotated gold standard of Urdu MWE s.

An NLP tool where the MWE s can be employed is the Urdu ParGram grammar (Butt and King, 2007; based on the Lexical-Functional Grammar ( LFG ) formalism (Dalrymple, 2001). For this task, differ-ent types of MWE s need to be distinguished as they are treated differently in the syntactic analysis.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 pro-vides a brief review of related work, in particular on MWE extraction in Indo-Aryan languages. Sec-tion 3 describes our methodology, with the evalua-tion following in Section 4. Section 5 presents the Urdu ParGram Grammar and its treatment of MWE s, followed by the discussion and the summary of the paper in Section 6. MWE extraction and classification has been the focus of a large amount of research. However, much work has been conducted for well-resourced languages such as English, benefiting from large enough cor-pora (Attia et al., 2010), parallel data (Zarrie X  and Kuhn, 2009) and NLP tools such as taggers or depen-dency parsers (Martens and Vandeghinste (2010), among others) and lexical resources (Pearce, 2001).
Related work on Indo-Aryan languages has mostly focused on the extraction of complex pred-icates, with the focus on Hindi (Mukerjee et al., 2006; Chakrabarti et al., 2008; Sinha, 2009) and Bengali (Das et al., 2010; Chakraborty and Bandy-opadhyay, 2010). While complex predicates also make up a large part of the verbal inventory in Urdu (Butt, 1993), for the scope of this paper, we restrict ourselves to classifying MWE s as locations or person names and filter out junk bigrams.

Our approach deviates in several aspects to the re-lated work in Indo-Aryan: First, we do not concen-trate on specific POS constructions or dependency relations, but use an unannotated middle-sized cor-pus. For classification, we use simple heuristics by taking the postpositions of the MWE s into account. These can provide hints as to the nature of the MWE . 3.1 Extraction and Identification of MWE The bigram extraction was carried out on a corpus of around 8.12 million tokens of Urdu newspaper text, collected by the Center for Research in Urdu Lan-guage Processing ( CRULP ) (Hussain, 2008). We did not perform any pre-processing such as POS tagging or stop word removal.

Due to the relatively small size of our corpus, the frequency cut-off for bigrams was set to 5, i.e. all bigrams that occurred five times or more in the cor-pus were considered. This rendered a list of 172,847 bigrams which were then ranked with the X 2 asso-ciation measure, using the UCS toolkit. 1
The reasons for employing the X 2 association measure are twofold. First, papers using compara-tively sized corpora reported encouraging results for similar experiments (Ramisch et al., 2008; Kizito et al., 2009). Second, initial manual comparison be-tween MWE lists ranked according to all measures implemented in the UCS toolkit revealed the most convincing results for the X 2 test.

For the time being, we focus on bigram MWE extraction. While the UCS toolkit readily supports work on Unicode-based languages such as Urdu, it does not support trigram extraction; other freely available tools such as TEXT -NSP 2 do come with trigram support, but cannot handle Unicode script. As a consequence, we currently implement our own scripts to overcome these limitations. 3.2 Syntactic Cues The clustering approach taken in this paper is based on Urdu-specific syntactic information that can be gathered straightforwardly from the corpus. Urdu has a number of postpositions that can be used to identify the nature of an MWE . Typographical cues such as initial capital letters do not exist in the Urdu script.
 Locative postpositions The postposition QK ( par) either expresses location on something which has a surface or that an object is next to something. 3 In addition, it expresses movement to a destination.  X   X  ( mEN ) expresses location in or at a point in space or time, whereas  X  K ( tak ) denotes that some-thing extends to a specific point in space.  X   X  X  ( sE ) shows movement away from a certain point in space.
These postpositions mostly occur with locations and are thus syntactic indicators for this type of MWE . However, in special cases, they can also occur with other nouns, in which case we predict wrong results during classification.
 Person-indicating syntactic cues To classify an MWE as a person, we consider syntactic cues that usually occur after such MWE s. The ergative marker  X  G ( nE ) describes an agentive subject in transitive sentences; therefore, it forms part of our heuristic for finding person MWE s. The same holds for the possessive markers
The accusative and dative case marker  X  X  ( kO ) is also a possible indicator that the preceding MWE is a person.

These cues can also appear with common nouns, but the combination of MWE and syntactic cue hints to a person MWE . However, consider cases such as New Delhi said that the taxes will rise. , where New Delhi is treated as an agent with nE attached to it, providing a wrong clue as to the nature of the MWE . 3.3 Classifying Urdu MWE s The classification of the extracted bigrams is solely based on syntactic information as described in the previous section. For every bigram, the postpo-sitions that it occurs with are extracted from the corpus, together with the frequency of the co-occurrence.

Table 1 shows which postpositions are expected to occur with which type of MWE . The first stipula-tion is that only bigrams that occur with one of the locative postpositions plus the ablative/instrumental marker  X   X  X  ( sE ) one or more times are considered to be locative MWE s ( LOC ). In contrast, bigrams are judged as persons ( PERS ) when they co-occur with all postpositions apart from the locative post-positions one or more times. If a bigram occurs with none of the postpositions, it is judged as being junk (
JUNK ). As a consequence this means that theoreti-cally valid MWE s such as complex predicates, which never occur with a postposition, are misclassified as being JUNK .

Without any further processing, the resulting clus-ters are then evaluated against a hand-annotated gold standard, as described in the following section. 4.1 Gold Standard Our gold standard comprises the 1300 highest ranked Urdu multiword candidates extracted from the CRULP corpus, using the X 2 association mea-sure. The bigrams are then hand-annotated by a na-tive speaker of Urdu and clustered into the following classes: locations, person names, companies, mis-cellaneous MWE s and junk. For the scope of this paper, we restrict ourselves to classifying MWE s as either locations or person names,. This also lies in the nature of the corpus: companies can usually be detected by endings such as  X  X orp. X  or  X  X td. X , as is the case in English. However, these markers are of-ten left out and are not present in the corpus at hand. Therefore, they cannot be used for our clustering. The class of miscellaneous MWE s contains complex predicates that we do not attempt to deal with here.
In total, the gold standard comprises 30 compa-nies, 95 locations, 411 person names, 512 miscella-neous MWE s (mostly complex predicates) and 252 junk bigrams. We have not analyzed the gold stan-dard any further, and restricting it to n &lt; 1300 might improve the evaluation results. 4.2 Results The bigrams are classified according to the heuris-tics outlined in Section 3.3. Evaluating against the hand-annotated gold standard yields the results in Table 2.

While the results are encouraging for persons with an f-score of 0.746, there is still room for improve-ment for locative MWE s. Part of the problem for per-son names is that Urdu names are generally longer than two words, and as we have not considered tri-grams yet, it is impossible to find a postposition after an incomplete though generally valid name. Loca-tions tend to have the same problem, however the reasons for missing out on a large part of the loca-tive MWE s are not quite clear and are currently being investigated.

Junk bigrams can be detected with an f-score of 0.379. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the mis-cellaneous MWE s (e.g., complex predicates), many of them are judged as being junk because they never occur with a postposition. If one could detect com-plex predicate and, possibly, other subgroups from the miscellaneous class, then classifying the junk MWE s would become easier. The extracted MWE s are integrated into the Urdu ParGram grammar (Butt and King, 2007; B  X  ogel et al., 2007; B  X  ogel et al., 2009), a computational gram-mar for Urdu running with XLE (Crouch et al., 2010) and based on the syntax formalism of LFG (Dal-rymple, 2001). XLE grammars are generally hand-written and not acquired a machine learning pro-cess or the like. This makes grammar development a very conscious task and it is imperative to deal with MWE s in order to achieve a linguistically valid and deep syntactic analysis that can be used for an addi-tional semantic analysis.

MWE s that are correctly classified according to the gold standard are automatically integrated into the multiword lexicon of the grammar, accompanied by information about their nature (see example (3)).
In general, grammar input is first tokenized by a standard tokenizer that separates the input string into single tokens and replaces the white spaces with a special token boundary symbol. Each token is then passed through a cascade of finite-state morpholog-ical analyzers (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003). For MWE s, the matter is different as they are treated as a single unit to preserve the semantic information they carry. Apart from the meaning preservation, in-tegrating MWE s into the grammar reduces parsing ambiguity and parsing time, while the perspicuity of the syntactic analyses is increased (Butt et al., 1999).
In order to prevent the MWE s from being inde-pendently analyzed by the finite-state morphology, a look-up is performed in a transducer which only contains MWE s with their morphological informa-tion. So instead of analyzing t3ul and AbEb sep-arately, for example, they are analyzed as a sin-gle item carrying the morphological information +Noun+Location . 4 (3) t3ul` AbEb: /t3ul` AbEb/ +Noun
The resulting stem and tag sequence is then passed on to the grammar. See (4) for an example and Figures 1 and 2 for the corresponding c-and f-structure; the +Location tag in (3) is used to produce the location analysis in the f-structure. Note also that t3ul AbEb is displayed as a multiword under the N node in the c-structure. Despite the simplistic approach for extracting and clustering Urdu MWE s taken in this paper, the re-sults are encouraging with f-scores of 0.5 and 0.746 for locations and person names, respectively. We are well aware that this paper does not present a complete approach to classifying Urdu multiwords, but considering the targeted tool, the Urdu ParGram grammar, this methodology provides us with a set of MWE s that can be implemented to improve the syn-tactic analyses.
 The methodology provided here can also guide MWE work in other languages facing the same re-source sparsity as Urdu, given that distinctive syn-tactic cues are available in the language.

For Urdu, the syntactic cues are good indica-tions of the nature of the MWE ; future work on this subtopic might prove beneficial to the clustering regarding companies, complex predicates and junk MWE s. Another area for future work is to extend the extraction and classification to trigrams to im-prove the results especially for locations and person names. We also consider harvesting data sources from the web such as lists of cities, common names and companies in Pakistan and India. Such lists are not numerous for Urdu, but they may nevertheless help to generate a larger MWE lexicon.
