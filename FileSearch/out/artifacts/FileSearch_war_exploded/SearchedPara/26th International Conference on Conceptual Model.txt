Conceptual modeling is fundamental to the development of Information Systems, as it provides the key communication means between systems developers, end-users and customers. Conceptual modeling provides languages, methods and tools to understand and represent the application domain; to elicitate, conceptualize and formalize system requirements and user needs; to communicate systems designs to all stake-holders; to formally verify and validate system designs on high levels of abstractions; and to minimize ambiguities in system development. Initially, conceptual modeling mainly addressed data-intensive information systems and contributed to data modeling and database application engineering. The area of concep-tual modeling has now matured to encompass all kinds of application areas such as e-applications (including e-business and e-learning), web-based systems (including the semantic web and ubiquitous systems), life science and geographic applications.

The annual International Conference on Conceptual Modeling serves as the premiere forum for presenting and discussing research and applications in all areas associated with conceptual modeling. Following ER 2007, the 26th International Con-ference on Conceptual Modeling, which was held in Auckland, New Zealand, from November 5th to November 8th 2007, authors of the nine best conference papers were invited to submit an extended version to this special issue of Data and Knowledge Engineering. Each submitted article was carefully reviewed by three independent referees. In some cases the guest-editors requested a major revision, which was then reviewed again in the same way. Finally, six articles were accepted for inclusion in this special issue.

In the article Modeling and Analysis of Security Trade-Offs  X  A Goal Oriented Approach by Golnaz Elahi and Eric Yu an exten-sion of the i framework for goal-oriented requirements engineering is proposed, which addresses the analysis of security trade-offs. The authors provide several convincing case studies for their method.
 The article Generic Schema Mappings for Composition and Query Answering by David Kensche, Christoph Quix, Xiang Li, Yong Li, and Matthias Jarke introduces extensional mappings that are based on dependencies between models in a generic role-based meta-model. These mappings support data translation between heterogeneous models, such as XML or relational schemata and OWL ontologies. The article focuses on mapping composition and optimization, verification of genericness, correctness, and composability, and harnessing schema mappings for answering queries against an integrated global schema.

Consistency in vague databases is the theme of the article Maintaining Consistency of Vague Databases using Data Depen-dencies by An Lu and Wilfred Ng. The authors utilize inclusion and functional dependencies to tackle first the problem of how to obtain the  X  X  X est X  approximation of a vague relation with respect to a set of dependencies, when taking into account thresholds for the median membership and the imprecision membership. Finally, they investigate the chase procedure as a means to maintain consistency.

The article On Managing Business Processes Variants by Ruopeng Lu, Shazia Sadiq and Guido Governatori presents an ap-proach to deal with dynamic change in Business Process Management exploiting process constraints. The authors focus on a facility for discovery of preferred variants through effective search and retrieval based on the notion of process similarity, where multiple aspects of the process variants are compared according to specific query requirements.

The article Schema Exchange: Generic Mappings for Transforming Data and Metadata by Paolo Papotti and Riccardo Torlone is devoted to the problem of schema exchange, in which mappings are defined over classes of similar schemas. The authors introduce the notion of schema template, which forms the basis for splitting the problem into first finding a schema that matches a source template, and then generating a new schema for a target template, based on a mapping between the two templates defined by means of first-order dependencies. The research results permit the definition of queries to migrate data from a source database into the one obtained as a result of a schema exchange. den-Web Table Interpretation, Conceptualization, and Semantic Annotation . The presented solution addresses the common spe-cial case in which sibling pages on the hidden web are available, which are commonly generated from underlying databases.
In particular, the approach compares them to identify and connect nonvarying components (category labels) and varying components (data values). Furthermore, given that tables can be automatically interpreted, the authors show that this leads immediately to a conceptualization of the data in these interpreted tables and thus to a way to semantically annotate these interpreted tables with respect to an ontological conceptualization.
