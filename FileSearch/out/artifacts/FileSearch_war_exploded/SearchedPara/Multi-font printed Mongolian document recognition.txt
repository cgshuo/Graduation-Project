 ORIGINAL PAPER Liangrui Peng  X  Changsong Liu  X  Xiaoqing Ding  X  Jianming Jin  X  Youshou Wu  X  Hua Wang  X  Yanhua Bao Abstract Mongolian is one of the most common written languages in China, Mongolia, and Russia. Many printed Mongolian documents still remain to be digitized for digital library applications. The traditional Mongolian script has a unique vertical cursive writing style and multiple font vari-ations, which makes Mongolian Optical Character Recog-nition challenging. As the traditional Mongolian script has subcomponent characteristics, such that one character may be a constituent of another character, in this work we define a novel character set for recognition using segmented com-ponents. The components are combined into characters in a rule-based post-processing module. For overall character rec-ognition, a method based on Visual Directional Features and multi-level classifiers is presented. For character segmen-tation, segmentation points are identified by analyzing the properties of projection profiles and connected components. Mongolian has dozens of different printed font types that can be categorized into two major groups, namely, standard and handwritten-style groups. The segmentation parameters are adjusted for each group. Additionally, script identifica-tion and relevant character recognition kernels are integrated for the recognition of Mongolian text mixed with Chinese and English. A novel multi-font printed Mongolian docu-ment recognition system based on the proposed methods is implemented. Experiments indicate a text recognition rate of 96.9% on the test samples from real documents with multiple font types and mixed script. The proposed methods can also be applied to other scripts in the Mongolian script family, such as Todo and Sibe, with significant potential for exten-sion to historic Mongolian documents.

However, compared to the existing OCR research work on Latin [ 25 ], CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) [ 6 , 20 ], and Arabic [ 18 ], Mongolian OCR is a relatively unexplored field. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for printed Mongolian document recognition.

To understand the problems of Mongolian OCR, it is necessary to examine characteristics of the Mongolian script. Mongolian is a representative of the Mongolic branch of the Altaic language family. The traditional Mongolian script was derived from the old Uighur script in the times of Chinggis Khan, around the twelfth century. Since then, it has been in continuous use in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and a few other provinces of China. In the Mongolian People X  X  Republic, the traditional Mongolian script was replaced for general use by Cyrillic orthography in 1946. The traditional Mongolian script is currently estimated to be used by about 5 million people.

The basic features of the traditional Mongolian script are as follows: 1. Vertical writing direction 2. Cursive alphabetic script 3. Several pairs of letters adopt the same presentation form 4. Mixed script These unique characteristics bring new challenges to Mongolian OCR research. Moreover, multiple font types and degraded image quality bring greater difficulty to the prob-lem of cursive character segmentation and recognition. As Fig. 1 shows, one of the most commonly used font types, Hawang Ti, is a handwritten-style. For samples in Hawang Ti and its related variant font types, it is hard to locate the baseline and segment the small characters because the strokes are slim and unstable. Examples of font type variations, with touching and broken strokes, of the Mongolian letter B (Unicode U + 182A) are shown in Fig. 2 . The degradation may be caused by poor print quality or inappropriate scanner settings. 1.2 Related research work There is thus far little reported research work on Mongolian OCR. Gao et al. [ 10 ] presented a structural and statistical combined method for printed Mongolian character recognition. The reported system did not support either handwritten-style font type or mixed Chinese and English in Mongolian documents. Our goal is to develop a robust printed Mongolian OCR system that can support commonly used multiple font types and mixed script.
 Most optical character recognition methods presented for Latin or Chinese characters assume that individual charac-ters can be easily isolated. These methods are not suitable for the cursive Mongolian script. Although both Mongolian and Arabic have cursive alphabets, the phenomenon of  X  X ne code, multiple shapes X  and  X  X ne shape, multiple codes X  in the Mongolian script creates significant difficulty and needs more complex methods.
 Existing recognition systems for cursive script, such as Arabic, can be categorized into segmentation-based sys-tems and segmentation-free systems, according to their approaches in tackling character segmentation.

Segmentation-based systems segment a word into char-acters [ 1 ], primitives [ 23 ]orstrokes[ 2 ] and then recognize segmented components, respectively. These components are combined to form character or word recognition results. The primary methods are based on projection, baseline analysis and word contour tracing. The proposed method in this paper belongs to this category.

Segmentation-free systems [ 4 ] attempt to recognize the whole word without trying to segment characters or prim-itives individually. This kind of approach was originally introduced for speech recognition. The approach is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where each character is rep-resented by a specific HMM model, words are represented by finite state machine. A number of research efforts have been made to extend 1-D HMM to 2-D that can provide a bet-ter description of the 2-D nature of characters [ 12 , 19 ] with increased computation complexity. 1.3 The contribution and organization of this paper The main contribution of this paper is to design a scheme to solve the problems in practical Mongolian document recognition. An overall block diagram of the document recognition process is given in Fig. 3 . The layout analysis module segments the input document image into homoge-nous regions, such as text regions, pictures and tables. The text region is then processed by the character segmentation and character recognition kernels. The post-processing mod-ule merges the recognized character elements into charac-ter presentation forms by pronunciation and grammar rules. Finally, text files in Unicode are output.

As the Mongolian script has subcomponent characteris-tics, such that one character may be a constituent of another character, and the dots of a character may shift to the adjacent subsequent character, we define a novel character set for rec-ognition using the segmented components. The components are combined into characters in a subsequent rule-based post-processing module.

To adapt to the variations of font types and image qual-ities, it is essential to extract robust features and design effective classifiers. The Visual Directional Feature is an extension of Directional Element Feature [ 15 ] to provide a better description of the characteristics of Mongolian strokes. To incorporate different kinds of information, we design and combine three classifiers, referred to as pre-classification, fine classification and similar character dis-crimination, respectively.

Character segmentation can form a bottle-neck problem, because errors at this stage spread into future stages. We pres-ent a scheme to find segmentation points by analyzing the properties of projection profiles and connected components. Different font styles bring different problems for character segmentation. To handle this problem, all the font types are classified into two groups, namely, standard and handwritten-style. A font type classification method is proposed. Param-eters in the character segmentation module are adjusted for the two groups.

One merit of our system is that it supports mixed script of Mongolian, Chinese and English. A script identifica-tion method is proposed and script-specific text recognition kernels are integrated.

Section 2 in this paper presents the character recognition scheme, which is the primary basis of the whole system. Section 3 introduces the character segmentation and text recognition schemes. Section 4 describes post-processing utilizing language information. The experimental results and conclusion are given in Sects. 5 and 6 , respectively. 2 Character recognition Character recognition is the foundation of the proposed Mongolian document recognition system. We adopt a statisti-cal methodology to achieve robust recognition performance. 2.1 Character element set Initially, the target character set for both character recogni-tion and character segmentation is defined by us. Although it is a natural choice to take the whole set of all presentation forms for the cursive script, as in many Arabic OCR sys-tems, there are three types of problems with doing this for the Mongolian letters: 1. Some characters may be subcomponents of another char-2. There are special combinations of two characters, such as 3. Ligatures are hard to segment, such as ligature BO ,
To address this, we adopt character sub-elements rather than character themselves as the target for segmentation and recognition. This leads to the inclusion of 89 charac-ter elements for Mongolian letters in the character set (see Appendix A), as well as English letters, numerals, punctua-tions and symbols. 2.2 Visual Directional Feature Inspired by the research work of Hubel and Wiesel on visual perception [ 12 ], we extended the commonly used Directional Element Feature [ 15 ] into the Visual Directional Feature, by introducing 5  X  5 templates that imitate the simple and com-plex receptive fields in an animal X  X  visual system, as Fig. 4 shows. Templates ( a )  X  ( h ) are for the simple receptive field, while ( i )  X  ( p ) are for the complex receptive field.  X  resents excitatory responses ( X  X n X  responses),  X   X   X  represents inhibitory responses ( X  X ff X  responses), and the numeric value is the strength of the responses. 2.3 Classifier By analyzing the characteristics of the Mongolian script, we present a multi-level classification strategy. Firstly, pre-classification is performed to reduce the size of the character sets, according to the character position in the word and occu-pied zone information. Secondly, the fine classifier gives a character recognition result. Finally, selected pairs of similar characters are discriminated by using local features with a Support Vector Machine (SVM). 2.3.1 Pre-classification The following two types of information are used to pre-classify the subset of characters. 1. Character form information 2. Occupied zone information
Based on the above discussion, the pre-classified infor-mation is represented by the two-dimensional vector PC = (
F , Z ) T . The component F is the form information, which can be isolated, initial, medial or final, and Z is the occu-pied zone, which can be one of the two defined types. The Mongolian character set is thus divided into eight sub-sets. 2.3.2 Fine classification Modified quadratic discriminant function (MQDF) and dis-criminative learning (DL) technologies are used to design and train the classifier. An expression of MQDF is given by [ 16 ]: g ( x ) = where  X  denote the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean vector,  X  i and  X  i denote the i th largest eigenvalue and eigenvector of the covariance matrix , K is the truncated dimension of main sub-space, h 2 is a small constant deter-mined by the small eigenvalues  X  i , i &gt; K , and n is the dimension of the feature vector space.

The discriminative learning method is proposed in the light of minimum classification error (MCE) criteria [ 14 ]to reduce classification error by iteratively adjusting the param-eters of the estimated MQDF via sample selection. 2.3.3 Similar character discrimination The similar character discrimination is designed for selected pairs of Mongolian characters that have relatively high con-fusion error rate. The adopted features include local stroke density and topology feature. SVM is used as the classifier. The features include: 1. Local stroke density feature 2. Topological feature 3 Character segmentation The process of segmentation includes the following steps: line and word segmentation, baseline estimation and charac-ter segmentation. The basic information used in these steps include vertical and horizontal projection, baseline, and con-tour, as Fig. 6 shows. Because the segmentation points are along the baseline, baseline estimation is important. After the selection of connected components, the vertical projec-tion and connected component analysis are used to segment text lines and words. Then, candidates of segmentation points are detected by examining the cost function of the baseline and contour of connected components. Finally, rules are used to merge over-segmented characters. 3.1 Line segmentation and word segmentation The objective of line segmentation is to divide a pure text region into text lines. After line segmentation, each text line is divided into words.

Factors that affect line and word segmentation are (1) the skew of the image; (2) touching characters across lines and (3) the shifting of dots to the adjacent character.
A straightforward line segmentation method is to get the blank spaces between adjacent lines by vertical projection. However, a blank space may be either the inter-space between lines or the intra-space between letter bodies and attached dots of the same line, which can be distinguished by a threshold.

If a image is skew, the vertical projection results will not be the expected small value. Existing line segmentation methods to segment skewed images are based on part-projection and part-counter tracing [ 27 ]. However, if characters belonging to different lines are touching, such methods will fail.
The most common word segmentation method is to iden-tify blank spaces by projection [ 26 ] and determine whether a blank space is inter-word or intra-word by mean value [ 1 ]or threshold [ 3 ]. If adjacent sub-words overlap vertically, meth-ods based on contour tracing [ 3 ] or connected components extraction can be used.

We propose a new hybrid top X  X own and bottom X  X p method, on the basis of connected components classification, to overcome the earlier mentioned difficulties, as described in the following sections. 3.1.1 Connected components classification Initially, we extract all connected components from text region R , namely, CC R ={ cc i , i = 1 ,..., n } , where n is the number of connected components. Let h i and w i represent the height and width of cc i , respectively. CC R can be parti-tioned into three disjoined sets B , S and M as follows. cc where  X  w = 1 n
With  X  1 = 1 . 5 and  X  2 = 0 . 5, set B comprises the touch-ing characters across lines, set S comprises the attached dots, punctuation and small isolated characters, and set M com-prises the letter bodies of most sub-words. 3.1.2 Vertical projection In order to eliminate the impact of the attached dots and the touching parts, only the connected components of the letter bodies ( cc i  X  M ) are selected to perform vertical projection. Text region R is segmented into sub-regions by blank spaces. A sub-region comprises one text line or multiple horizontally overlapped lines if the image is skew. 3.1.3 Connected components analysis If a sub-region comprises multiple lines, there are lots of connected components pairs ( cc i , cc j ), where cc i is adjacent to cc j . We can determine whether the sub-region comprises more than one text line by the number of such pairs.
If a sub-region comprises multiple lines, then the algo-rithm sorts all cc i  X  M in the sub-region by the upper bor-der in increasing order. Each time it takes out a connected component ( cc i ) in order, and then find the connected com-ponent ( cc k ) that has the maximum overlap with cc i .Ifthe overlap exceeds a threshold, cc i and cc k are in the same line, otherwise cc i belongs to a new line. After processing all cc i  X  M , we have the position of each text line. For the touching connected components ( cc i  X  B ) , cc i is cut into slices to assign to the corresponding lines. 3.1.4 Word segmentation Inatextline L , the attached dots ( cc s  X  S ) should be assigned to corresponding sub-words. For each cc s  X  S , we search the nearest letter body of a sub-word cc m  X  M .If cc s is above, below or inside cc m , then cc s and cc m belong to the same sub-word, otherwise cc s belongs to another sub-word.
Finally, sub-words are merged into words by distinguish-ing inter-word or intra-word spaces with a threshold.
Examples of line segmentation and character segmenta-tion are shown in Fig. 7 . 3.2 Character segmentation A Mongolian character segmentation method based on contour analysis is proposed. After estimating the baseline position of a given word, a cost function D ( x ) is used to eval-uate the distance between the contour and the baseline. After that, candidate segmentation points are determined by ana-lyzing cost function D ( x ) , and over-segmented characters are merged by rules, as described in the following sections. 3.2.1 Baseline width estimation Generally, the width of the vertical baseline is fixed. After extracting the horizontal black run-lengths at each row of a word, the width with the maximum run-length number is taken as the width of the baseline. 3.2.2 Baseline position estimation Let p be the horizontal projection profile of text line image L , w be the width of L and w 0 be the baseline width, the baseline boundary ( B Left and B Right ) of L is estimated by finding the maximum vertical projection stripe with width w ,asEq. 3 shows.  X   X   X   X   X 
B Left = arg max
However, if the image is skew, the projection method will not work. For a 300DPI scanned A4 image, the longest ver-tical text line length is about 3,500 pixels, and the baseline width is about 6 X 7 pixels. If the skew angle is only 0.5 degree, the vertical difference between the two ends of the baseline will be about 30 pixels.

In the proposed method, the baseline of a text line is assumed to be piecewise linear, and each section of the base-line is estimated on the basis of a relatively long sub-word or several consecutive short sub-words. If the length of a single sub-word is longer than k  X  w 0 ,Eq. 3 is used to calculate the baseline position. Otherwise, Eq. 3 is used to calculate the baseline position of several consecutive short sub-words. According to the distribution of Mongolian words, the param-eter k usually ranges from 10 to 15. Finally, the least square method is used to calculate the slope of the line baseline, so that the precise baseline position of each word can be estimated. 3.2.3 Candidate segment points search The key problem in character segmentation is to find the pre-cise segmentation points. Printed Mongolian characters are usually connected on the baseline, so that searching candidate segmentation points along the baseline is reasonable. The segmentation points satisfy the following basic conditions: 1. The segmentation point is on the baseline. 2. Above the segmentation point, the contour position 3. Below the segmentation point, the contour position
We define a cost function to calculate the segmentation cost for each position: D ( x ) =| B where B L ( x ) and B R ( x ) are the left and right contours of the baseline. L ( x ) and R ( x ) are the left and right contours of the body of the connected component, and H is the height of the connected component. The candidate segmentation points are the local minimum points of D ( x ) that value is less than the baseline width. Examples of cost functions for the first two samples in Fig. 1 are shown in Fig. 8 .
 The attached dots are assigned to the nearest letter bodies. A rule-based method is used to merge over-segmented parts. The process is shown in Fig. 9 . 3.3 Font type classification As mentioned earlier, Mongolian has different printed font types that are categorized into two major groups: stan-dard or handwritten-style. The segmentation parameters are adjusted for each group, including relevant threshold set-tings. The proposed font type classification method adopts a shape parameter, which is the ratio of the area to the perim-eter of a connected component. The motivation is the fact that a handwritten-style character is usually slimmer, with shape parameter smaller than that of the standard style. Train-ing samples are used to choose an appropriate threshold for classification. The font type in a text line is assumed the same, so that the font type classification results are calculated across an entire line to obtain a more stable result. 3.4 Script classification There are two types of methods for recognition of mixed script document, one is to construct a general purpose charac-ter segmentation and recognition scheme that support mixed method before applying script-specific character segmenta-tion and recognition [ 11 , 28 ]. As the characteristics for Mon-golian, Chinese and English are quite different, it is hard to develop a general purpose character segmentation and recog-nition scheme for all the three scripts. It is feasible to adopt the script identification-based method.

The script identification method in our system utilizes four types of information: 1. Geometric information: The geometric structure for dif-2. Statistical classification: After extracting feature vector, 3. Recognition confidence [ 17 ]: Character recognition con-4. Contextual information: Contextual information is use-
The statistical classification method is the most basic method for script identification. As the character set of each script is large, the characters in each script are partitioned into clusters by K -means method. If a input character belongs to one of the subsets, then the script is identified. The feature extraction method and MQDF classifier are the same as that used in character recognition method (see Sect. 2 ).
In the recognition process, statistical script identifica-tion method is performed on the character blocks after pre-segmentation. Then, language-specific character seg-mentation and recognition algorithms are performed on text blocks with the same script.

The character recognition confidence is calculated by using the distance output by the classifier.
 Conf = 100  X  1  X 
Where d 1 and d 2 denote the recognition distances of the first and the second candidates.

If the confidence is greater than a threshold and the char-acter width to height ratio is valid, the script identification results are accepted. Otherwise, the script is changed accord-ing to contextual information. The process is shown in Fig. 10 . 4 Post-processing The post-processing module mainly uses linguistic knowl-edge at character and word level, the process includes merg-ing the character elements into corresponding character presentation form and converting the presentation form into Unicode encoding. 4.1 Merging the character elements We have developed a set of rules according to contempo-rary Mongolian corpora. These rules use contextual phonetic constraints, such as consonant X  X owel combinations, to check and merge separated character elements. The rules are estab-lished in two steps. Initially, the character elements are cate-gorized according to phonetic properties as vowel (marked as V ), consonant ( C ), ligature ( N ), undetermined ( M ) and non-alphabetic component ( B ), where undetermined ( M ) means that the character element can be either vowel or consonant according to context information, and non-alphabetic com-ponent ( B ) means that the character is only part of a character. Phonetic property information is used to apply consonant X  vowel combination constraints. Secondly, rules are formu-lated to define the input and output of the merging process. The input includes the character elements and their contex-tual information. The output includes the merging result, as well as the phonetic property of the merging results, i.e., vowel/consonant category. An example of merging charac-ter elements by rules is shown in Fig. 11 . 4.2 Converting presentation forms into Unicode According to the Unicode standard, only the basic charac-ter is encoded among all the variants of a Mongolian letter, while other variant presentation forms will not be encoded. The presentation forms thus have to be converted into the encoded basic character, and we need language information to fulfill the conversion.

Although Mongolian characters are complex, there are still some basic features, such as the position of the syllable that contains the current letter in a word, consonant X  X owel combinations, and the gender of the vowels included in a word. The gender of the vowels is related to vowel harmony in the Mongolian language, a feature that is also common in Turkish. The concept of vowel harmony means that a word can only contain either back vowels ( A , O , U ), i.e., mas-culine vowels, or front vowels ( E , OE , UE ), i.e., feminine vowels, but not both at the same time. The vowel I is con-sidered neutral and can therefore occur in both front and back-voweled words. Vowel harmony also affects some con-sonant letters, which occur only in back-voweled words or front-voweled words. An example of rules in Unicode con-version is shown in Fig. 12 . In addition, a dictionary check is used.
 To make the complete Unicode output, the No-Break Space and the Mongolian Vowel Separator (U + 202F and U + 180E) are added at the proper positions in the Mongolian OCR results. The above mentioned two glyphs appear as narrow spaces. 5 Experimental results We carried out experiments to evaluate the performance of isolated character recognition, script identification and text recognition methods.

For isolated character recognition, Experiment A is to compare the main classifier MQDF with the Euclidean distance classifier and the quadratic discriminant function (QDF) [ 16 ] classifier. Experiment B finds out the optimum iteration times of the Discriminant Learning for MQDF (DL X  X QDF). Experiment C and D show the effect of adding pre-classification module and similar character identification module successively.

For script identification, results are presented as the con-fusion matrix of statistical classification of the 3 classes: Mongolian, Chinese and English scripts.

We implemented a printed Mongolian document recog-nition system and evaluated the system on practical Mon-golian document samples. The samples are separated into two parts, one includes pure Mongolian samples, the other includes mixed script of Mongolian, Chinese and English. 5.1 Isolated character recognition results The isolated character database is generated by collecting True Type Font samples from the predominant Mongolian electronic publishing system (Founder, Huaguang, Menksoft, etc.) in China. By controlling the printing and scanning parameters, multi-font Mongolian samples with different sizes and image qualities are generated. There are 2,000 binary images in average for each character in the character set. Randomly selected 3/4 of database is used as the training data, and the rest as the test data.
 Experiment A: Performance of MQDF Table 1 illustrates that the MQDF outperforms the Euclidean Distance (ED) classifier, the QDF on both the training set and test set of isolated Mongolian character samples. The dimen-sion of main sub-space in the MQDF was set to K = 64 based on the results shown in Fig. 13 . We set the value of h 2 to the average  X   X  K + 1 of  X  K + 1 over all classes. The curve in Fig. 13 is obtained for the training set, but the curve for the test set is essentially the same.
 Experiment B: Selection of discriminant learning iteration times Discriminant learning method is used to minimize the bias of the MQDF model, by adaptively adjusting model parameters when a sample is located near the actual deci-sion boundary. Figure 14 shows the recognition rate of DL X  X QDF on the training set and the test set as a function of the number of the training rounds. The optimal iteration times are selected to achieve good generalization ability on the test set.
 Experiment C: Pre-classification Experiment C was made on isolated characters with infor-mation to simulate the character form and zone information got in character segmentation. The results in Table 2 show the potential effect of pre-classification. The actual perfor-mance of pre-classification in text recognition process is not evaluated as it is dependent on performance of character seg-mentation.
 Experiment D: Similar character discrimination The similar character discrimination module slightly improve the performance further, as Table 3 shows. 5.2 Script identification The data set consists of three sets of isolated character sam-ples used in training Mongolian, Chinese, English charac-ter recognition kernel. The cluster numbers got by K -means method are 58 in Mongolian, 76 in Chinese and 32 in English (including numerals), respectively. Then, the script identi-fication problem is converted into a classification problem with 166 sub-classes. The final result is determined by the script property of the output sub-class. The confusion matrix of the final results is shown in Table 4 . The results indicate that the confusion between Mongolian and English is rela-tively higher. The test results do not reflect the influence by character segmentation errors. 5.3 Text recognition results To test the text recognition performance of the Mongolian document recognition system, we developed a Mongolian Document Image Test Set (MGTest). 1 The samples were col-lected from practical Mongolian books, journals and news-papers. There are 99,810 characters in 40 pages, including font type variations and mixed Chinese and English scripts. The layout analysis results are manually set to focus on the text recognition performance. The evaluation method is to compare the recognition results and the ground truth then obtain a text recognition rate [ 7 ].
 The test set can be separated into two parts, 30-page pure Mongolian samples and 10-page mixed script samples.
We separated the pure Mongolian samples according to the image quality, moderate and degraded sets. The main sources of degradation in these samples are the poor print quality of the original documents or noise interference, as shown in Fig. 15 . The test results on pure Mongolian sam-ples are shown in Table 5 .

The 10-page mixed script samples contain 28,139 char-acters in total, including 446 Chinese characters and 507 English characters. The test results on mixed script samples are shown in Table 6 .

The overall text recognition rate is 96.9%. Among the 3.1% error rate, character recognition errors constitute 1.4% and character segmentation errors 1.7%.

The most frequent character recognition errors are shown in Fig. 16 . Some errors are caused by the degradation of image, such as broken strokes in Fig. 16 a and b. Some errors are caused by font variations, such as in Fig. 16 c and d. Examples of character segmentation errors are shown in Fig. 17 . When a word is short as in Fig. 17 a, especially the font type is handwritten-style, failure in baseline estimation brings subsequent errors in character segmentation and rec-ognition. Some errors are caused by the degradation of image quality, such as touching strokes in Fig. 17 b.
 Figure 18 shows an example of script identification error. Chinese characters with simple strokes are easily confused with Mongolian or English characters. 6 Conclusion and future work Multi-font printed Mongolian document recognition system is important for digitization and utilization of Mongolian cultural resources. This paper has introduced a multi-font printed Mongolian document recognition system, with sup-port to mixed script of Mongolian, Chinese and English. The following was shown by experiments: 1. The combination of the three level classifiers provides a 2. The text recognition on pure Mongolian document shows 3. Mongolian, Chinese and English mixed script text rec-
The methods presented in this paper are effective on mod-ern Mongolian documents and could be applied to other scripts in the Mongolian script family, such as Todo and Sibe. Future work may include extension to historic document rec-ognition. As historic Mongolian documents are handwrit-ten, the baseline is not stable. The character segmentation schemes for handwritten Mongolian text may rely on more sophisticated baseline estimation and contour analysis tech-nologies.
