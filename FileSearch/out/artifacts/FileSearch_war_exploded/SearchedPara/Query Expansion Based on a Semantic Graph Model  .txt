 Query expansion is a classical topic in the field of information retrieval, which is proposed to bridge the gap between searchers X  information needs and their queries. Previous researches usually expand queries based on document collections, or some external resources such as WordNet and Wikipedia [1, 2 , 3, 4, 5]. However, it seems that independently using one of these resources has some defects, document collections lack semantic information of words, while WordNet and Wikipedia may not include domain-specific knowledge in certain document collection. Our work aims to combine these two kinds of resources to establish an expansion model which represents not only domain-specific information but also semantic information. 
In our preliminary experiments, we construct a two-layer word graph and use Random-Walk algorithm to calculate the weights of each term in pseudo-relevance feedback documents, then select the highest weight ed term to expand original query. The first layer of the word graph contains terms in related documents, while the second layer contains semantic senses corresponding to these terms. These terms and semantic senses are treated as vertices of the graph and connected with each other by all possible relationships, such as mutual information and semantic similarities. We utilized mutual information, semantic similarity and uniform distribution as the weight of term-term relation, sense-sense relation and word-sense relation respectively. Though these experiments show that our expansion outperform original queries, we are troubled with some difficult problems. 
Given the framework of semantic graph model, we need more effort to find out an optimal graph to represent the relationships between terms and their semantic senses. We utilized a two-layer graph model in our preliminary research, where terms from different documents are treated equally. Maybe we can introduce the document as a third layer in future work, where we can differ the same terms in different documents according to document relevance and context. 
Then we need appropriately represent initial weights of this words, senses and relationships. Various measures for weights of terms and term relations have been proved effective in other information retrieval tasks, such as TFIDF, mutual information (MI), but there is little research on weights for semantic senses and their relations. For polysemous words, we add all of their semantic senses to the graph and assume that these senses are uniform ly distributed. Actually, it is not precise for a word in a
