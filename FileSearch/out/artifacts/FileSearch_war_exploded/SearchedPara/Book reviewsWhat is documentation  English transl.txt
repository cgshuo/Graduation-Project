Ronald E. Day and Laurent Martinet with Hermina G.B. Anghelescu, Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, 2006. xi + 72 pp., ISBN-13: 978-0-8108-5109-2; ISBN-10: 0-8108-5109-1, $25
How can information specialists collect, manage, preserve, manipulate and disseminate information with-out understanding its fundamental nature? What Suzanne Briet calls documentation is so important because it is at the heart of the work of all information specialists today. This book  X  X  What is Documentation X  X  certainly sheds an illuminating light on the past, hopefully helping us to better understand the future.
Several books have been published on the subject of documentation. Indeed, a search of Books in Print indi-cates that there are over 100 books on the subject. But this unique little book first published in French as
Qu X  X st-ce que la documentation? in 1951 is without comparison particularly for its forward looking definition and analysis of the basic information entity  X  the document. A Spanish version of this book was published in 1960 but this is the first English edition.

The editors, translators and contributors of this particular book are eminently qualified to produce a work of this nature. Ronald E. Day who at the time of writing this book was an Assistant professor at Wayne State
University is now an Associate Professor at Indiana University; Laurent Martinet works on the indexing and content management of databases at L  X  X xpress magazine, Paris, and is a translator of English documents into
French; Hermina G. B. Anghelescu is an Assistant professor in the Library and Information Science Program at Wayne State University and Michael K. Buckland is a Professor Emeritus at UC Berkeley School of Information.

So who was Suzanne Briet (1894 X 1989) that we should be interested in her work? She is considered a pio-neer of European Documentation or what may be considered as Information Science or Information Manage-ment and the work of Special Libraries. She worked for 30 years at the French National Library, the Bibliothe ` que Nationale (BN). She participated in the founding of the Union Franc  X aise des Organismes de
Documentation (UFOD) and held leadership positions in several other major information related organiza-tions. She also helped coordinate the development of library-related standards in France after World War
II. She was so active and made such a contribution to her profession that she was given the nickname  X  X  X a-dame Documentation X  X . Her work and stature make her akin to the more well-known Jesse Shera and Eugene
Garfield. Research about Briet and the original publication Qu X  X st-ce que la documentation has been published in the literature by Buckland, Day and others (Buckland, 1997; Buckland, 1991; Day, 2001; Maack, 2004; Tourney, 2003).

The translated work has been enhanced by a five-page preface written by Ronald E. Day which adds value to the translation by explaining Briet X  X  importance, giving an overview of the book and placing her work in context. The book What is Documentation also includes a seven page annotated brief biography of Briet, a 17 page commentary and analysis and a five-page selective bibliography of Briet X  X  work all done by Michael
Buckland. Together the preface and biography convinces us of the importance of Briet to the information pro-fession and also the value of the work Qu X  X st-ce que la documentation?
For its historical value alone, this book is worthy of interest. Yet, there is so much more than historical information to be had from this book. The translation of Briet X  X  work is given from pages 9 to 46 of the book.
It is a faithful translation of the original which was presented in three parts or sections: I. A Technique of Intel-lectual Work (pages 9 X 19), II. A Distinct Profession (pages 20 X 34) and III. A Necessity of Our Time (pages 34 X  43). Each section is dedicated to one of Briet X  X  contemporaries  X  the first section to Julien Cain, the general administrator at the BN and Suzanne Briet X  X  supervisor when she was there as a librarian. The reader is made aware of this by the informative notes of the translators and editors which go to great lengths to explain and clarify the identities of people and organizations named in her work.

The most often quoted part of this book is Briet X  X  discussion of the definition of the document . Briet re-moves the association of the document with paper and form so common at that time and quotes an unnamed contemporary bibliographer  X  X  X oncerned about clarity X  X  as defining a document as:  X  X  X  proof in support of a fact X  X  (p. 9). She presents her own definition of the document as:
This radical departure from the thinking of the time so much more attuned to what we conceive of a document today is sufficient to justify the bringing of this work to the English reading world.

Briet goes on to present some intriguing ideas on the nature of a document. For example, she notes that a star in the sky or a living animal in the wild cannot be considered to be a document. But then Briet tells the reader that photographs and catalogs of stars in a museum are documents. She illustrates her point further by the suggestion that unlike the animals in the wild, the animals cataloged and shown in a zoo are documents! We are transported onto a journey of wonder into what makes  X  X  X omething X  X  a  X  X  X ocument X  X .

For almost every discussion in Briet X  X  work, the reader easily sees a parallel to present day information sci-ence or management. For example, she describes what we may conceive of today as the information cycle or what she calls the  X  X  X ocumentary fertility X  X  of the origins of a fact. She illustrates this by using the example of the discovery of an antelope in Africa which leads to press releases in the newspaper, radio, etc. and later on to the creation of sound recordings, films, paintings, statues and microfilms of the antelope. Briet illuminates the distinction between the primary or  X  X  X nitial X  X  document (the cataloged antelope in a museum) and the many secondary and  X  X  X erived X  X  documents. How many of us would have thought of using an antelope in the context of such a discussion?
This is all the more amazing when we remember that Briet X  X  work was written over 50 years ago! Further-more, Briet, in considering how technology was changing the field of documentation tells us that The reader wonders what Briet would have said if she lived today in the so-called information age?
In the second section of her work entitled  X  X  A Distinct Profession  X  X  which she dedicated to Louis Ragey who headed the Conservatoire National des Arts et Me  X  tiers (CNAM), she describes the duties of the documental-ist. Briet X  X  work gives a fascinating look at early work done on bibliographic referencing forms and other information related standards by the International Association of Standards (ISA), the forerunner of the well-known International Standards Organization (ISO).

It is interesting to read Briet X  X  description of  X  X  X ocumentary prospecting/prospection X  X  tools as bookstore catalogs and bibliographies. The reader immediately sees the contrast between these tools and the now ubiq-uitous Internet Search Engines and RSS feeds. Like others of her time (Garfield, 1953) she spends some time distinguishing between the profession of documentalist and librarian. She mentions the importance of the cre-ation of secondary documents e.g., catalogs, analyses, bibliographies, documentary summaries and finding aids to aid dissemination  X  to  X  X  prospect and divulge X  X  work related to a specific discipline.
This is indeed a thought-provoking book which brings us back to the basics  X  a discussion of the arguably fundamental bibliographic entity  X  the document and the professions and agencies that work to manage this entity. Describing the replacement of filing cards in a catalogue with the punched cards of  X  X  X erforated card machines X  X , Briet makes the prophetic statement that  X  X  X he documentalist will be more and more dependent upon tools whose technicality increases with great rapidity X  X  (p. 29). We are warned that the information specialist or
Briet X  X   X  X  X omo documentator  X  X  must get ready to  X  X  take command-with all his senses awake-over the robots of tomorrow X  X  (p. 30).
Section III of her work entitled  X  X  A Necessity of our Time  X  X  is dedicated to Charles Le Maistre who we are told in the translators X  notes was a cofounder of ISO. Here Briet spends time on documentation as an institution, describing the different types of documentation centers, national documentary organizations and the forging of international links. We are also given valuable information about the early work of UNESCO.

And long before it became fashionable to pontificate on user-centeredness in libraries and information services, she chooses to quote the words of M. Luther Evans who we are told by the translators was the Direc-tor of the Library of Congress (1945 X 1954). She quotes his strong criticism of library services for being con-siderate of the needs of the subject specialist librarians rather than the needs of researchers.
To the reader, Briet is seen as a true visionary as she also reveals her view about the importance of what we call information literacy today. Briet tells us that:
In this book, the editors and translators did an admirable job of not just converting the French to its English meaning but bringing true understanding of Briet X  X  work to English readers, not living in her time and so una-ware of the people and places mentioned. In addition to the three pages of very informative notes at the end of the translated work, the translators and editors also include notes in the body of Briet X  X  work to indicate any variation from the original. For example, on page 33, an annotation is given to a chart representing Briet X  X  idea of the varying qualifications needed by the staff of documentary agencies indicating that because of word processing limitations, the editors  X  X  X ad to slightly modify the exact, original appearance of Briet X  X  chart X  X  . There are very few instances where the translators are unable to clearly communicate the meaning of Briet X  X  words and this is always noted.

Following the translation of Briet X  X  work, Ronald E. Day provides the reader with a 17-page commentary and analysis entitled  X  X  X  X  A Necessity Of Our Time  X  X  : Documentation as  X  X  Cultural Technique  X  X  X  X . Day gives a synopsis and analysis of Briet X  X  work concentrating on her references to culture. Day X  X  essay considers (pages 52 X 58). He discusses Briet X  X  focus on the mix of technology, technique and mechanical and intellectual tools in documentation that he suggests pervades her work. Day goes on to describe Briet X  X  work in the con-text of  X  X  Cultures and the Collapse of the Meaning of  X  X  Culture  X  X  X  X  (p. 58 X 61).

Readers without some knowledge of cultural theory may find Day X  X  analysis sometimes difficult to follow but Ronald E. Day does a good job in giving us some insight into Briet X  X  meaning of the word  X  X  X ulture X  X  in her work. He sees Briet as an  X  X  X nteresting theorist X  X  not just on library and information studies but also as a cul-tural theorist. The most thought-provoking part of Day X  X  essay is the fourth section entitled  X  X  X ulture X  X  and the future of libraries X  X  (p. 61 X 62).

Ronald E. Day gives the reader new insight into Briet X  X  work revealing to us one of his truly significant interpretations of Briet X  X  work  X  her belief in the end of libraries as we know it. He interprets Briet X  X  work as indicating that
The reader is forced to re-examine the very purpose of the information profession and its associated agencies like libraries.

Day X  X  analysis re-emphazises Briet X  X  notion of the book as only one of many kinds of documents. The ca-sual reader of Briet X  X  work may not have realized the implications of her statements but Day does an excellent job of bringing this to our consciousness. We are told that since documents are the products of cultures, as cultures change so will the types of documents, document centers and the technologies and techniques to man-age and manipulate these. A truly enlightening and stimulating analysis, so that just when the reader thinks they understand what Briet was asserting, Day X  X  essay and interpretations bring that much more meaning and value out of her work.

A five-page selective bibliography of Suzanne Briet X  X  work compiled by Michael K. Buckland completes this very readable book. In the introduction to this section, we are told that a more complete listing is given at Buckland X  X  website (http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~buckland/Brietwebbib.pdf). The bibliography includes both primary and secondary documents (e.g., reviews and English summaries). Unfortunately, because Briet was French, the English reader will have some difficulty deciphering the titles of the works listed since the titles are all in French. The translators may consider translating the titles of the works in the bibliography to aid the reader in fully appreciating the extent of Briet X  X  contribution to the profession.

Briet X  X  work sometimes reads as more of a manifesto on the nature of information, the profession of the information specialist and its associated services and agencies rather than a detailed scholarly work. Briet pre-sents her ideas and beliefs with some illustrations/examples and leaves the reader to either agree or disagree.
Briet also often refers to and quotes others without naming them. For example, on page 32 of the book she refers to an English colleague who tried to characterize documentary activity without naming him.
This publication would have been enhanced by the inclusion of pictures possibly of Briet and places of his-torical interest mentioned in the book such as the Bibliothe ` que Nationale. Despite its small size, an index would be a useful addition to such a book.

In this era of  X  X penness X , the editors, translators and publishers of this book and Briet X  X  heirs should be ap-plauded for making available much of it at Ronald E. Day X  X  website at Indiana University (http://ella.slis.indi-ana.edu/~roday/briet.htm).

All in all, this book is a scholarly treasure that is very easy to read and should interest all information spe-cialists particularly those interested in the history of information management, the influence of culture on information and also international librarianship. Well worth the price, this is a book to be bought and trea-sured enabling us to see the present information era that much more clearly by giving some illumination of the past.
