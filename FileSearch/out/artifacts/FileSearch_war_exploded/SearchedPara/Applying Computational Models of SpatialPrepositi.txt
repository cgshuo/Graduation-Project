Following this, we present two new computational models of topological and projective spatial prepositions. The main novelty within these models scene can have on the region described by a given preposition. We next present psycholinguistic how these models are used for both interpretation and generation of prepositional expressions. 1. Introduction
A growing number of computer applications share a visualize d(virtual or real) space with the user, for example graphic design programs, computer games, navigation aids, robot systems, an dso forth. If these systems are to be equippe dwith dialog interfaces, they must be able to participate in visually situate d dialog. Visually situate d dialog is spoken from a particular point of view within a physical or simulate dcontext. From theoretical linguistic an dcognitive perspectives, visually situate d dialog systems are interesting as they provide ideal testbeds for investigating the interaction between language an dvision. From a human X  X omputer interaction (HCI) perspective, visually situated dialog systems promise many advantages to users interacting with these systems. In this article we describe computational models for the interpretation and generation of visually situate dlocative expressions involving topological an dprojective spatial prepositions.
 in the physical environment in which the dialog occurs. People often use locative expressions, in particular spatial prepositions, to pick out objects in the visual envi-ronment. In this article we present computational models of the semantics of spatial prepositions an dillustrate how these mo dels can be use din a visually situate d dialog system for reference resolution and generation. These models are designed to handle reference resolution an dgeneration in complex visual environments containing multi-ple objects, an dto account for the contextual influence which the presence of multiple objects has on the semantics of spatial prepositions. In this our models move beyond other accounts, which typically do not model the contextual influence of other objects on spatial semantics. Because most real-worl dvisual scenes are complex an dcontain multiple objects, our models for the semantics of spatial prepositions are important for visually situated dialog systems intended to operate usefully in the real world. discussing locative expressions. In Section 3 we present an abstract architecture for a visually situated dialog system and, using this architecture, illustrate how the spa-tial reasoning component of the architecture interacts with the other components of the system. In Section 4 we review psycholinguistic data on the semantics of spatial prepositions. Section 5 reviews previous computational models of spatial prepositional semantics. Section 6 presents our computational models accounting for the semantics of spatial prepositions an dthe influence of visual context on those semantics, an dSection 7 presents psycholinguistic evaluation of these models. Section 8 presents applications of the models in implemented systems. Section 8.1 presents an application of our models to the interpretation of locative expressions, base don Kelleher, Kruijff, an dCostello (2006), an dSection 8.2 presents algorithms which use these mo dels to generate locative expressions to identify objects in visual scenes from Kelleher and Kruijff (2006). 2. Terminology
Our computational models are designed to interpret and generate locative expressions involving spatial prepositions. The term locative expression describes  X  X n expression involving a locative prepositional phrase together with whatever the phrase modifies (noun, clause, etc.) X  (Herskovits 1986, page 7). In this article we use the term target (T) to refer to the object that is being locate dby a locative expression an dthe term landmark 1 (L) to refer to the object relative to which the target X  X  location is described; see Example (1). We will use the term distractor to describe any object in the visual context that is neither the landmark nor the target.

Within this set a distinction can be made between static and dynamic prepositions: static prepositions primarily 272 the location of an object, dynamic prepositions primarily denote the path of an object (Jackendoff 1983; Herskovits 1986), see Examples (2) and (3).

 topological and projective . Topological prepositions are the category of prepositions referring to a region that is proximal to the landmark; for example, at , near . Often, the distinctions between the semantics of the different topological prepositions is based on pragmatic constraints, for example the use of at licenses the target to be in contact with the landmark, while the use of near does not. Projective prepositions describe a region projected from the landmark in a particular direction, with the specification of the direction dependent on the frame of reference 3 being used; for example, to the right of , to the left of . 3. Visually Situated Dialog System Architecture

Consequently, these systems use both visual an dlinguistic contextual information to understand user commands and to generate linguistic descriptions of the environment.

The arrows in the figure represent data flows through the system; the boxes are the main information processing components. speech interpretation pipeline. The vision subsystem directly updates the system X  X  representation of the visual context. The basic requirements for the vision subsystem are that it is able to detect an dcategorize the objects in the visual context an dcan provide geometric positioning information for each visible object.

Parsers range in function from wide-coverage syntactic focused parsers, such as Cahill et al. X  X  (2004) probabilistic Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) parser, to narrow coverage se-mantic base dparsers, for example the CoSy parser (Kruijff, Kelleher, an dHawes 2006).

In these parsers the elements in the lexicon an dgrammar are base don an analysis of the entities an drelations of the specific domain the system is designed for. These parsers sacrifice coverage for depth of analysis. For a dialog system, the advantage of this deeper analysis is that the semantic information in the parser X  X  output can be use dby the dialog manager to relate the input to the rest of the dialog. The parse structure on the right of Figure 3 illustrates the type of semantically rich representation that an interactive dialog system parser might produce (this particular representation was generate dby the CoSy parser).

Within this representation the statement b2:phys-obj means that the referent b2 is of type phys-obj (i.e., a physical object as defined by the ontology the grammar in-dexes). The semantic contribution of the prepositional phrase near the ball is represented by the &lt; Location &gt; structure an dits subcomponents. This structure describes a locative prepositional phrase containing a static preposition that locates the referent b2 in the region r that is proximal to the landmark described by the &lt; Anchor &gt; subcomponent. It shoul dbe note dthat the syntactic an dsemantic representation of prepositions within grammars is an area of ongoing research (see Gawron 1986; Tseng 2000; Beermann and

 relates to the current dialog context. This categorization is driven by the dialog manager an dinvolves interpreting an utterance as a dialog act (Bunt 1994; Carletta et al. 1997;
Klein 1999). One of the important tasks in this process is resolving the references in the input. Consequently, the dialog manager may invoke the reference resolution component. Reference resolution is one of two functions in the architecture where spatial reasoning plays an important role. From a computational perspective, reference resolution involves two main tasks: an object in the visual context which has not yet been mentione din the dialog) or it may be anaphoric (i.e., access a representation of a previous referring expression in the dialog context). People often use the spatial location of an object, described using spatial prepositions, when making exophoric references. As a result, in order to interpret these references the system must have access to models of the semantics of the prepositions used. In this architecture this access is provided through the spatial reasoning compo-nent. Figure 4 illustrates the translation between the qualitative, parser-generated, and the geometric, vision subsystem X  X enerate drepresentations that must be performe din order to interpret a spatial locative expression.
 system needs to generate a response to the last input utterance. For example, the utterance may have been a question, such as whereisx? or which x? . In such cases, the dialog manager informs the content planner of this. The role of the content planner is to determine the semantic content that should be included in the system X  X  output, rather than the linguistic realization of this content. Indeed, the content planner may generate a logical representation closer to the parse structure on the right of Figure 3 than to a natural language description.
 the secon dfunction in the architecture where spatial reasoning plays an important role.
The function of the GRE component is to determine the set of properties that distinguish a particular target object from the other objects in the scene. For example, in response to a question such as which x? the GRE component may determine that a color and type description is sufficient to distinguish the target object, resulting in an answer such as the blue x being linguistically realized. However, it may be the case that the location of the target in the scene is the only way to distinguish it. In such cases, the GRE component needs access to computational models of the spatial prepositions if it is to determine which spatial relation is most suitable. Figure 5 illustrates the translation from a geo-metric to qualitative representation that is performe d during the GRE process by the spatial reasoning module when a locative description is being generated by the system. determines a surface linguistic form in which this content can be conveyed. Finally, the speech synthesis systems generate the speech output for the linguistic string create dby the realizer. 4. Psycholinguistic Data on Spatial Prepositions
Spatial reasoning is a complex activity that involves at least two levels of process-ing: a geometric level where metric, topological, an dprojective properties are han dle d 276 (Herskovits 1986), an da functional level where the normal function of an entity affects the spatial relationships attribute dto it in a context (Coventry an dGarro d2004). Some of this work has focuse don functional aspects of prepositional semantics (e.g.,
Haywar dan dTarr 1995; Coventry 1998; Garro d, Ferrier, an dCampbell 1999), an dsome on geometric factors (Gapp 1995; Logan an dSa dler 1996; Regier an dCarlson 2001). In this article we are primarily concerne dwith the geometric semantics of prepositions and, consequently, our review will focus on the experimental data that addresses geo-metric factors. We will begin by reviewing the experimental data describing topological spatial prepositions. Following this, we will then review data relating to projective prepositions.
 quently we discuss previous psycholinguistic experiments, focusing on how contex-tual factors such as distance, size, and salience may affect proximity. We also present examples showing that the location of other objects in a scene may interfere with the acceptability of a proximal description to locate a target relative to a landmark. their experiments, a human subject was shown sentences of the form the X is [relation] the O , each with a picture of a spatial configuration of an O in the center of an invisible 7  X  7 cell grid, and an X in one of the 48 surrounding positions. The subject then had to rate how well the sentence described the picture, on a scale from 1 (bad) to 9 (good).
Figure 6 gives the mean goodness rating for the relation  X  X ear to X  as a function of the position occupie dby X (Logan an dSa dler 1996). It is clear from Figure 6 that ratings diminish as the distance between X and O increases, but also that even at the extremes of the gri dthe ratings were still above 1 (minimum rating).
 proximal relation. For example, given prototypical size, the region denoted by near the building is larger than that of near the apple . Moreover, an object X  X  salience coul dinfluence the determination of the proximal region associated with it; as with size, the more salient an object is the larger the proximal region associate dwith it (Gapp 1994).
 scene on the left we can use the blue box is near the black box to describe object (c). This seems inappropriate in the scene on the right. Placing an object (d) beside (b) appears to interfere with the appropriateness of using a proximal relation to locate (c) relative to (b), even though the absolute distance between (c) and (b) has not changed.
 context, subjects have the ability to grade the applicability of a spatial relation. Logan and Sadler (1996) introduced the term spatial template to describe the representation of the regions of acceptability associate dwith a preposition. A spatial template is centere d on the landmark and identifies for each point in its space the acceptability of the spatial relationship between the landmark and the target appearing at that point being described by the preposition. Second, there is empirical evidence pointing to the effects of distance between that landmark and the target, and landmark salience and size on the applicability of a proximity-base dpreposition. Finally, the examples presente dpoint to the fact that the location of other distractor objects in context may also interfere with the applicability of a preposition. (The model of proximity we present in Section 6 captures all these factors.) above described in Logan and Sadler (1996). The main points of note relating to these data are that there are three regions in the spatial template (good, acceptable, and bad) and these regions are symmetric around the canonical direction of the preposition with acceptability approaching 0 as the angular deviation from the canonical direction approaches 90 degrees. However, it should be noted that these data were gathered dur-ing an interpretation task an dthat the task may have affecte dthe subjects X  responses. 278
Although the subjects may have rate dsome of the areas on the far right an dleft of the landmark as acceptable with respect to interpreting an utterance such as above the landmark , this does not mean that they would use the word above to describe a target object in these regions relative to the landmark. This highlights the fact that people may be more accommodating when they are interpreting a locative description (for example, they may extend the allowable angular deviation to 90 degrees) but be more specific when generating a locative description. 5. Previous Models of Topological and Projective Spatial Prepositions
There has been much research on the formal properties an dinteractions of topological relations, for example Cohn et al. (1997) an dKuipers (2000). However, before these higher-level frameworks can be applied to real-world data, a model of proximity that is capable of segmenting a region at the metric or geometric level is required. At this geometric level previous approaches to modeling topological prepositions have adopted one of two approaches to defining the region of proximity. The first is to adopt a
Voronoi segmentation of space. Under this approach the region considered as proximal to an object is the area surrounding it that is closer to it than to any other object in the scene. The second is to define the proximal region in terms of the size of the landmark.
For example, Gapp (1995) defines the area of proximity as the region within ten times the size of the landmark object in each direction. However, neither of these approaches consider the effect that the locations of other objects in the scene have on the proximity.
Consequently, they cannot distinguish between the different context provided by the twoimagesinFigure7.

Olivier an dTsujii 1994; Gapp 1995; Fuhr et al. 1998; Regier an dCarlson 2001; Kelleher and van Genabith 2006). Yamada (1993) introduced the concept of a potential field function to capture the gradation of applicability across the region described by the preposition. Later work (Olivier an dTsujii 1994; Gapp 1995) highlighte dthe issue of defining the intended frame of reference. Building on this work and the psycholin-guistic results of Carlson-Ra dvansky an dLogan (1997), Kelleher an dvan Genabith (2006) developed a computational model that constructed a modified spatial template in situations where frame of reference ambiguity occurred. Fuhr et al. (1998) used models of prepositional semantics in order to interpret natural language commands to a robotic arm. Fuhr et al. segmente dthe space aroun dan object into different regions base d on the sides and vertices of the object X  X  bounding box. One of the drawbacks of this system, however, was that it coul dnot distinguish between the position of two or more objects that were fully enclose dwithin a given region. Finally, Regier an dCarlson (2001) developed a vector sum algorithm to compute the applicability of a projective relation between a landmark and a target. However, as with previous topological models, none of these models consider the influence of other objects in the context of the landmark target relationship. For example, the introduction of the long black object into image 2 in Figure 9 affects the interpretability of a reference such as thebluesquareabovethe white rectangle . In the next section we describe new models designed to account for the influence of other objects in the semantics of spatial prepositions. 6. Models of Visual Context in Topological and Projective Spatial Prepositions
If a computational model is going to accommodate the gradation of applicability across a preposition X  X  spatial template it must define the semantics of the preposition as some sort of continuum function. A potential field model is one form of continuum measure that is widely used (Yamada 1993; Gapp 1994; Olivier and Tsujii 1994; Regier an dCarlson 2001). Using this approach, a mo del of a preposition X  X  spatial template is constructe dusing a set of normalize dequations that, for a given origin an dpoint, computes a value that represents the cost of accepting that point as the interpretation of the preposition.
 spatial template models a different geometric constraint specified by the preposition X  X  semantics. For example, for topological prepositions such as near , an equation inversely proportional to the distance between a point and a landmark would be used, while for projective prepositions such as to the right of , an equation modeling the angular de-viation of a point from the idealized direction denoted by the preposition would be in-clu de din the construction set; Gapp (1995) an dLogan an dSa dler (1996) both note dthat acceptability of a projective preposition being use dto describe a location approaches 0 as the angular deviation of that location approaches 90 degrees. The potential field is then constructe dby assigning each point in the fiel dan overall potential by inte-grating the results compute dfor that point by each of the equations in the construc-tion set.
 280 objects in the visual scene on the semantics of a topological or projective preposition.
The basic idea in our computational models is to extend the potential field approach by overlaying the potential fields for each object in a visual scene and combining those fields to produce relative potential fields for topological or projective prepositions.
These relative potential fields represent the semantics of those prepositions as modified by the presence of other objects in the visual scene. 6.1 Computational Model of Topological Prepositions
In this section we describe a model of relative proximity that uses (1) the distance between objects, (2) the size an dsalience of the lan dmark object, an d(3) the location of other objects in the scene. Our model is based on first computing absolute proximity between each point an deach lan dmark in a scene, an dthen combining or overlaying the resulting absolute proximity fields to compute the relative proximity of each point to each landmark. 6.1.1 Computing Absolute Proximity Fields. We first compute for each landmark an ab-solute proximity field giving each point X  X  proximity to that landmark, independent of proximity to any other landmark. We compute fields on the projection of the scene onto the 2D-plane, represente das a 2D-array of points. At each point P in that array ,the absolute proximity for landmark L is
In this equation the absolute proximity for a point P an da lan dmark L is a function of both the distance between the point and the location of the landmark, and the salience of the landmark.
 which returns a value between 0 an d1. 5 The smaller the distance between L and P , the higher the absolute proximity value returned, that is, the more acceptable it is to say that P is close to L . In this way, this component of the absolute proximity fiel dcaptures the gradual gradation in applicability evident in Logan and Sadler (1996).
 afunction salience ( L ), returning a value between 0 an d1 that represents the relative salience of the landmark L in the scene (Equation (2)). For the current purposes we assume that the relative salience of an object is the average of its visual salience ( S an d discourse salience ( S disc ). 6 (2004). Computing a relative salience for each object in a scene is base don its perceivable size an dits centrality relative to the viewer X  X  focus of attention. The algorithm returns scores in the range of 0 to 1. As the algorithm captures object size, we can model the effect of landmark size on proximity through the salience component of absolute proximity. The discourse salience ( S disc ) of an object is compute dbase don recency of mention (Hajicov  X  a 1993) except we represent the maximum overall salience in the scene as 1, and use 0 to indicate that the landmark is not salient in the current context. 0.5, for points from the upper-left to the lower-right of a 2D plane, with the landmark at the center of that plane. The graph shows how salience influences absolute proximity in our model: For a landmark with high salience, points far from the landmark can still have high absolute proximity to it. 6.1.2 Computing Relative Proximity Fields. Once we have constructe dabsolute proximity fields for the landmarks in a scene, our next step is to overlay these fields to produce a measure of relative proximity to each landmark at each point. For this we first select a landmark, and then iterate over each point in the scene comparing the absolute proximity of the selecte dlan dmark at that point with the absolute proximity of all other landmarks at that point. The relative proximity of a selected landmark at a point is equal to the absolute proximity fiel dfor that lan dmark at that point, minus the highest absolute proximity fiel dfor any other lan dmark at that point:
The idea here is that the other landmark with the highest absolute proximity is acting in competition with the selected landmark. If that other landmark X  X  absolute proximity 282 is higher than the absolute proximity of the selecte dlan dmark, the selecte dlan dmark X  X  relative proximity for the point will be negative. If the competing landmark X  X  absolute proximity is slightly lower than the absolute proximity of the selecte dlan dmark, the selecte dlan dmark X  X  relative proximity for the point will be positive, but low. Only when the competing landmark X  X  absolute proximity is significantly lower than the absolute proximity of the selected landmark will the selected landmark have a high relative proximity for the point in question.
 that point X  X  distance from the landmark decreases (the closer the point is to the land-mark, the higher its proximity score for the landmark will be), but falls as that point X  X  distance from some other landmark decreases (the closer the point is to some other landmark, the lower its proximity score for the selected landmark will be). Figure 11 shows the relative proximity fields of two landmarks, L1 and L2, computed using
Equation (3) in a 1-dimensional (linear) space. The two landmarks have different de-grees of salience: a salience of 0.5 for L1 an dof 0.6 for L2 (represente dby the different sizes of the landmarks). In this figure, any point where the relative proximity for one particular landmark is above the zero line represents a point which is proximal to that landmark, rather than to the other landmark. The extent to which that point is above zero represents its degree of proximity to that landmark. The overall proximal area for a given landmark is the overall area for which its relative proximity field is above zero. The left and right borders of the figure represent the boundaries (walls) of the area.
 imal area is a function of the landmark X  X  position relative to the other landmark and to the boundaries. For example, landmark L2 has a large open space between it and the right boundary: Most of this space falls into the proximal area for that landmark.
Landmark L1 falls into quite a narrow space between the left boundary and L2. L1 thus has a much smaller proximal area in the figure than L2. Second, the relative proximity field for a landmark is a function of that landmark X  X  salience. This can be seen in Figure 11 by considering the space between the two landmarks. In that space the width of the proximal area for L2 is greater than that of L1, because L2 is more salient.
 neither of the landmarks have a significantly higher relative proximity than the other.
There are two such areas in the Figure. The first is between the two landmarks, in the region where one relative proximity fiel dline crosses the other. These points are ambiguous in terms of relative proximity because these points are equidistant from those two landmarks. The second ambiguous area is at the extreme right of the space shown in Figure 11. This area is ambiguous because this area is distant from both landmarks: Points in this area would not be judged proximal to either landmark. The question of ambiguity in relative proximity judgments is considered in more detail in Section 8.1.
 illustrated in Figure 12. The task is to decide whether the target object is proximal to the landmark object. Figure 13 illustrates the absolute potential field for the landmark 284 object. Figure 14 illustrates the absolute potential fields for the landmark and the distractor object. Figure 15 illustrates the relative proximity field that results from the interaction between the landmark and distractors absolute proximity fields. Figure 16 illustrates the application of the threshold to the landmark X  X  relative proximity field. If the target object is locate din the region where the lan dmark X  X  relative proximity fiel d is above the threshol dthe target is deeme dto be proximal to the lan dmark. Figure 16 demonstrates the contextual influence which the distractor object has on the landmark X  X  relative proximity field: The field shrinks on the side of the landmark near the distractor, but expands on the side away from the landmark. 6. 2Computational Model of Projective Prepositions
The two main factors that impact on the applicability of a projective preposition de-scribing the spatial relationship between a target object an da lan dmark are the angular deviation of the target object X  X  position from the canonical direction described by the preposition relative to the landmark and the distance of the target object from the landmark.
 describes the canonical search axis for in front of . We can produce the search vectors horizontal plane. Once the canonical vector c for a given projective preposition has been selected, the angular deviation of a given point P position relative to the landmark L can be compute dusing Equation (4): where LP is the vector from landmark L to point P and c is the canonical vector for the projective preposition in question. This equation gives the angle between LP an dthat canonical vector. 286 we define an absolute potential field for the acceptability of a projective preposition with canonical vector c forlandmarkLasfollows:
In this equation, if the angle between a point P an dthe canonical vector c is greater than 90 degrees, or if the distance between the landmark and the point is 0, the acceptability of that point for the projective preposition is 0. Otherwise, the acceptability of that point is equal to the angle between that point and the canonical vector, divided by the normalized distance between that point and the landmark.
 that we use dthe absolute fiel dfor proximity in our mo del of topological prepositions.
Once we have compute dthe absolute potential fiel dfor each point relative to the landmark we then do the same process for each of the distractor landmarks. We then overlay the landmark applicabilities with those of the distractors by subtracting the maximum applicability of any of the distractors at a point from the landmark X  X  applicability at that point, producing a relative potential field for the projective prepo-sition as in Equation (6): the area described by the projective preposition. Note that we can use Equation (6) to compute relative potential fields for various different projective prepositions (in front of , to those prepositions.
 the origin is at the front right corner, the x -axis runs from right to left, the y -axis from front to back, an dthe z -axis is the vertical. The higher the z -axis value the more applicability the preposition. Figure 17 defines the baseline applicability of z =0.1.We use this baseline because dividing an angular deviation by distance will never result in a zero value; rather applicability will approach 0 asymptotically. The baseline provides a cut-off point for applicability. Figure 18 illustrates the potential fiel dcompute dfor right of a landmark positioned at x = 100, y = 200, z = 0 with a search axis of x =1, y = 0. Figure 19 illustrates the potential fields computed for right of the landmark and a distractor object positioned at x = 150, y = 400, z = 0. Finally, Figure 20 illustrates the potential fiel dthat results for right of the landmark when the distractor potential field is subtracted from it. Figure 20 demonstrates the contextual influence which the distractor object has on the landmark X  X  relative potential field for the preposition: the size of the field is reduced by the presence of the distractor object. 7. Psycholinguistic Evaluations of Our Models
We now describe an experiment which tests our approach to relative proximity by examining the changes in people X  X  judgments of the appropriateness of the expression near being used to describe the relationship between a target and landmark object in an image where a distractor object is present. All objects in these images were colored shapes: circles, triangles, or squares. 7.1 Materials and Procedure
All images use din this experiment containe da central lan dmark object an da target object, usually with a third distractor object. The landmark was always placed in the 288 middle of a 7  X  7 grid. Images were divided into eight groups of six images each. Each image in a group containe dthe target object place din one of six different cells on the grid, numbered from 1 to 6. Figure 21 shows how we number these target positions according to their nearness to the landmark.
 In group a the distractor is directly above the landmark, in group b the distractor is rotate d45 degrees clockwise from the vertical, in group c it is directly to the right of the landmark, in d it is rotate d135 degrees clockwise from the vertical, an dso on. The distractor object is always the same distance from the central landmark. In addition to the distractor groups a,b,c,d,e,f, and g , there is an eighth group, group x , in which no distractor object occurs.

All participants were native English speakers an dall volunteere dto take part. Participants were not linguists an dwere naive to the formal interpretation of spatial prepositions an dto the hypotheses being teste din the experiment. Participants were aske dto rate the acceptability of the sentence as a description of the image using a 10-point scale, with zero denoting not acceptable at all; 4 or 5 denoting moderately acceptable; and 9 perfectly acceptable. Figure 22 illustrates a trial from the experiment. Each participant rated every image in the experiment. Images were presented in random order to control for learning effects. 7. 2Results and Discussion
There was significant agreement between participants across all 48 images. The average pair-wise correlation between participants X  responses was r = 0 . 68. There was a signifi-cant correlation of responses between every pair of participants (p &lt; 0 . 01 for all pairs).
We assess participants X  responses by comparing their average proximity judgments with those predicted by the absolute proximity equation (Equation (1)), and by the relative proximity equation (Equation (3)). For both equations we assume that all objects have a salience score of 1. With salience equal to 1, the absolute proximity equation relates proximity between target and landmark objects to the distance between those two objects, so that the closer the target is to the landmark the higher its proximity will be. With salience equal to 1, the relative proximity equation relates proximity to both distance between target and landmark and distance between target and distractor, so 290 that the proximity of a given target object to a landmark rises as that target X  X  distance from the landmark decreases but falls as the target X  X  distance from some other distractor object decreases. It shoul dbe note dthat proximity scores in both Equations (1) an d (3) are multiplied by a constant salience an dthat the evaluations we describe below (correlation, multiple regression) factor out multiplication by a constant. Consequently, choosing a particular value for salience does not affect our evaluation results. (Equation (1), in which proximity falls with increasing distance between target and landmark) with the  X  X elative proximity X  extension of this equation (Equation (3), in which proximity falls with increasing distance between target and landmark, but rises with distance to distractor). Because both equations are quite similar (both are based on target X  X andmark distance, which is obviously the prime factor in proximity judgments), we expect both equations to produce quite similar responses. We expect, however, that the relative proximity equations will produce responses which are reliably closer to people X  X  proximity judgments than those produced by the absolute proximity equation. proximity scores with those produced by Equation (1) (absolute proximity) and Equa-tion (3) (relative proximity) for each group. For each group this analysis replaces each proximity score with its rank within that group, an dthen compares the ranks. Where the ranks returne dby an equation an dthe ranks from participants X  average proximity scores are identical, the correlation will be 1.0; where the ranks differ, the correlation will drop. For the absolute proximity equation, the correlation was 1.0 in six of the groups, an d.94 in the two remaining groups (group c an dgroup g ). For the relative proximity equation, the Spearman X  X  rank-order correlation with people X  X  responses was 1.0 in each of the eight groups. The fact that the relative proximity equation has a rank-order correlation of 1.0 in all groups while the absolute proximity equation fails to reach 1.0 in two groups (predicting proximity-ranks incorrectly in those two groups) suggests that the relative-proximity equation is a better model of people X  X  proximity responses.
However, the fact that there are so many correlations of 1.0 means that Spearman X  X  rank-order correlation is not particularly useful in distinguishing between the two equations.
We therefore use Pearson X  X  product-moment correlation to compare people X  X  average proximity scores with those produced by the absolute and relative proximity equations. Rather than comparing ranks, this analysis compares actual proximity values. imity ratings an dthose pro duce dby Equation (1) (absolute proximity) an dby Equa-tion (3) (relative proximity) for the eight groups in the experiment. In analyzing these correlations we had two concerns: first, to see whether, for each individual group, the correlation produced by Equation (3) was reliably different from that produced by
Equation (1); and second, to see whether across all the groups, the correlation produced by Equation (3) was reliably higher than that produced by Equation (1). In regard to the first question, we did not expect there to be particularly large differences in correlation between the two equations, because both are base don target X  X an dmark distance. Because we know target X  X andmark distance to be a good predictor of people X  X  proximity judgments we expected Equation (1) to have a high correlation with people X  X  proximity ju dgments, an dwe expecte dEquation (3) to improve on that correlation.
However, because the correlation from Equation (1) was already high, any improvement in correlation from Equation (3) woul dbe relatively small. In dee dthis is what is seen across the seven groups of interest: The average correlation from Equation (1) is high (average 0.93), the average correlation from Equation (3) is higher (average 0.99), but the difference between the two correlations is relatively small. Using Fisher X  X  technique for comparing correlation coefficients we fin dno reliable difference between correlation coefficients in any group.
 whether the results returne dby Equation (3) were reliably closer to human ju dgments than those from Equation (1). For the 42 images where a distractor object was present we recorded which equation gave a result that was closer to the participants X  normalized average for that image. In 28 cases Equation (3) was closer, an din 14 Equation (1) was closer (a 2:1 advantage for Equation (3), significant in a sign test: n += 28, n 2 . 2,p &lt; 0 . 05). We conclude that proximity judgments for objects in our experiment are best represente dby relative proximity as compute din Equation (3). These results support our  X  X elative X  model of proximity. 7 participants X  responses in the experiment, with target X  X andmark distance and target X  distractor distance as the predictor variables, and participant response as the depen-dent variable. Because our experiment involved repeated-measures data, we followed the procedure for regression analysis of repeated-measures data described by Lorch and Myers (1990). This involves computing individual multiple regression for each participant in our experiment, an dthen using a t-test to analyze the regression coef-ficients produced for target X  X istractor distance and target X  X andmark distance in those equations, across all participants. Recall that in our relative proximity equation (Equa-tion (3)) target X  X andmark distance had a negative coefficient (as target X  X andmark dis-tance increased, judgments of target X  X andmark proximity fell) whereas target X  X istractor 292 distance had a positive coefficient (as target X  X istractor distance increased, judgments of target X  X andmark proximity increased). Our prediction, therefore, is that across these multiple regression analyses of participants X  responses, the target X  X andmark distance variable will reliably have a negative coefficient, whereas the target X  X istractor variable will reliably have a positive coefficient.

As this table shows, the regression coefficient for target X  X andmark distance was significantly more likely to be negative (as predicted) whereas the regression coefficient for target X  X istractor distance was significantly more likely to be positive (again, as predicted). A single-group t-test showed that both target X  X andmark regres-sion coefficients and target X  X istractor regression coefficients reliably differed from zero variables ha da significant an dreliable effect on participants X  responses in the exper-iment. There was no concern about collinearity between predictor variables in these regression analyses, as the correlation between those variables ( r = 0 . 38, % var = 0 . 14) was much lower than that between the predictor variables and the dependent variable ( r = 0 . 93 or higher). Together these regression results, the sign-test results, an dthe comparative correlations described earlier all support the model of relative proximity as described in Equation (3). 8. Applications of the Models
The mo del of proximity presente dhere has been implemente dan duse das a compo-nent in a human X  X obot dialog system (Kelleher and Kruijff 2006; Kelleher, Kruijff, and Costello 2006). The proximity an dprojective mo dels have also been integrate dinto the

 *p &lt; 0 . 01, **p &lt; 0 . 05 . 294 8.1 Interpreting Spatial References We use the computational models of Section 6 to interpret spatial references to objects.
In this section we illustrate how we use our model of relative proximity to ground the interpretation of a locative expression containing a topological preposition. Returning to the architecture described in Section 3, the basic steps triggering the interpretation of a locative are: (1) the user utters a command, such as pick up the ball near the red box , (2) the speech recognition module processes the speech signal and passes the resulting string to the parser, (3) the parser constructs a formal representation of the meaning of the utterance, (4) the dialog manager categorizes the utterance to be a command and, also, recognizes the nee dto resolve the referring expression the ball near the red box .At this point the reference resolution module is triggered.
 reference is to be resolved. This involves accessing the context model and retrieving the set of currently accessible objects. This set is then subdivided into the set of objects fulfilling the landmark description, the set of objects fulfilling the description of the target object, an dthe set of objects fulfilling neither description.
 nor a candidate target we compute an absolute proximity field. For each landmark we convert its absolute proximity fiel dinto a relative proximity fiel dby overlaying the absolute proximity fields of the other landmarks and the other objects in the context that are neither candidate landmarks nor target objects. For this we iterate over each point in the scene, an dcompare the competing absolute proximity scores at each point.
If the primary landmark X  X  (i.e., the landmark with the highest relative proximity at the point) relative proximity exceeds the next highest relative proximity score at a given point by more than a predefined confidence interval, the point is in the proximity region anchore daroun dthe primary lan dmark. Otherwise, we take it as ambiguous an dnot in the proximal region that is being interpreted. The motivation for the confidence interval is to capture situations where the difference in relative proximity scores between the primary landmark and one or more landmarks at a given point is relatively small.
Figure 24 illustrates the parsing of a scene into the regions  X  X ear X  two landmarks. The relative proximity fields of the two landmarks are identical to those in Figure 11, using a confidence interval of 0.1. Ambiguous points are where the proximity ambiguity series is plotte dat 0.5. The regions  X  X ear X  each lan dmark are those areas of the graph where each landmark X  X  relative proximity series is the highest plot on the graph.
 proximity fields naturally defines the extent of vague proximal regions. For example, see the region right of L2 in Figure 24. The extent of L2 X  X  proximal region in this direction is bounded by the interference effect of L1 X  X  relative proximity field. Because the landmarks X  relative proximity scores converge, the area on the far right of the image is ambiguous with respect to which landmark it is proximal to. In effect, the model captures the fact that the area is relatively distant from both landmarks. In Section 8.2 we describe a cognitive load hierarchy of prepositions and how we use this to generate locative expressions. Following this hierarchy, objects locate din the area on the far right of the image shoul dbe describe dwith a projective relation such as to the right of L2 rather than a proximal relation like near L2 . 8.1.1 An Example. To illustrate the model further we will apply the model to a real scene.
Figure 25 shows a real scene on the left-han dsi de, an da ren dering of the scene analysis on the right-han dsi de. For the shown scene analysis we have assume dall objects to have an equal salience: on the left, the blue ball; in the middle, the red ball; and on the right, the green ball. As the analysis correctly shows, each object has a proximity potential fiel d(shown in its own color) but, due to interference between potential fields, we see that proximity is usually ambiguous between at least two landmarks.
The regions that are ambiguous between two landmarks are colored using a mixture of the colors. The white area denotes the regions defined as being ambiguous between the three objects.
 command pick up the blue ball near the red ball . As explaine dpreviously, when the system starts interpreting this reference it will split the context into a set of candidate target objects, consisting of the two blue balls in the scene, the set of candidate landmarks, consisting of the one re dball, an dthe set of remaining objects, the green ball. It will then compute proximity fields for each of the candidate landmarks and the other objects in the scene that are not candidate targets. It will then overlay these proximity fields 296 to compute the relative proximity fields around each landmark. Figure 26 illustrates the resulting proximity fields. As can be seen from the image the original blue ball is insi de the re dball X  X  proximity fiel dan dconsequently it will be selecte das the ball to be picke dup.

Secon d, the proximity fiel dof the re dball is much larger then that of the green ball; this is due to the relatively high linguistic salience of the re dball compare dto the green ball due to it being mentione d in the reference. 8. 2Generating References
In this section we illustrate how we use our models of the semantics of spatial preposi-tions to guide the generation of a locative expression in visual situated contexts. manager. Similar to reference resolution, GRE will first retrieve the context from the context model and generate the reference relative to this context. If a locative expression is necessary the GRE component has three things to decide: (1) what properties of the target object to include, (2) which object in the scene should be used as a landmark and how shoul dthat be describe d, an d(3) which spatial relation to use (an dhence which preposition to use).
 (Dale and Haddock 1991; Horacek 1997; Gardent 2002; Krahmer and Theune 2002;
Varges 2004). However, all these algorithms assume the GRE component has access to a predefined scene model that defines all the spatial relations between all the entities in the scene. For many visually situated dialog systems, in particular robotic dialog systems, this assumption is a serious drawback for these algorithms. If an agent wishes to generate a contextually appropriate reference it cannot assume the availability of a domain model, rather it must dynamically construct one. Moreover, constructing a model containing all the spatial relationships between all the entities in the domain is prone to combinatorial explosion, both in terms of the number of objects in the context (the location of each object in the scene must be checke dagainst all the other objects in the scene) an dnumber of inter-object spatial relations (as a greater number of spatial relations will require a greater number of comparisons between each pair of objects). Furthermore, the context-free apriori construction of such an exhaustive scene model is cognitively implausible. Psychological research indicates that spatial relations are not preattentively perceptually available (Treisman an dGormican 1988).
Rather, their perception requires attention (Logan 1994, 1995). These findings point to subjects constructing contextually dependent reduced relational scene models, rather than an exhaustive context-free model.
 combinatorial explosion inherent in relational scene model construction by incremen-tally creating a series of reduced scene models. Within each scene model only one spatial relation is considered and only a subset of objects are considered as candidate landmarks. This reduces both the number of relations that must be computed over each object pair an dthe number of object pairs. The decision as to which relations shoul dbe included in each scene model is guided by a cognitively-motivated hierarchy of spatial relations. The set of candidate landmarks in a given scene is dependent on the set of objects in the scene that fulfill the description of the target object and the semantic relation that is being considered .

A property is added to the list of selected properties if it reduces the size of the distractor object set.

The algorithm can be refined by ordering the checking of properties according to fixed preferences; for example, first a taxonomic description of the target, second an absolute property such as color, thir da relative property such as size.

However, we wish to generate locative expressions which iden-tify objects, rather than simple descriptions. These locative expressions may contain a description of a landmark object (in terms of type, color, or size), of a target object (type, color, or size), an da topological or projective preposition relating those two 298 Algorithm 1 The Basic Incremental Algorithm objects. To generate such locative expressions we repeatedly call the basic incremental algorithm for a sequence of different possible spatial relations. The fact that each call to the algorithm uses a different spatial relation results in a different set of objects from the context being defined as candidate landmarks for each function call. If a given spatial relation allows the basic incremental algorithm to generate a description which distinguishes the target object from the set of distractor objects, that spatial relation is use dto generate an expression i dentifying that object. Otherwise we move on an dcall the basic incremental algorithm for the next spatial relation in our sequence. reference or dere dby assume dcognitive loa d(see Figure 27), with simpler forms of reference (those identifying object type, for example) coming early in the sequence an dmore complex forms (those involving projective prepositions, for example) coming later.

If the target or one of the distractor objects is the only ob-ject within that region aroun da given lan dmark, this is taken to represent a contrastive use of a preposition relative to that landmark. If that region contains more than one object from the target an d distractor object set, then it is a relative use of the preposition. 8.2.1 Landmarks and Distinguishing Descriptions. In order to use a locative expression, an object in the context must be selecte dto function as the lan dmark. An implicit assumption in selecting an object to function as a landmark is that the hearer can easily identify and locate the object within the context. As shown in Example (4), a landmark can be the speaker, the hearer, the scene, an object in the scene, or a group of objects in the scene. 8
Example 4 is a complex process. Some of the factors effecting this decision are object salience an dthe functional relationships between objects. However, one basic constraint on landmark selection is that the landmark should be distinguishable from the target. For example, in the context provided by Figure 28 the ball has a relatively high salience, because it is a singleton, despite the fact that it is smaller and geometrically less complex than the other figures. Moreover, in this context, the ball is the only object in the scene that can function as a landmark without recourse to using the scene itself or a grouping of objects in the scene. Given the context in Figure 28 an dall other factors being equal, using a locative such as the man to the left of the man woul dbe much less helpful than using the man to the right of the ball .
 following conditions are met:
Furthermore, a target landmark is a member of the candidate landmark set that stands in relation to the target under the relation being considered and a distractor landmark 300 is a member of the candidate landmark set that stands in relation to a distractor object under the relation being considered.

If this fails, we divide the context into three compo-nents: the target, the distractor objects, and the set of candidate landmarks. We then begin to iterate through the hierarchy of relations an dfor each relation we create a context model that defines the set of target and distractor landmarks. Once a context model has been created we iterate through the target landmarks (using a salience order-ing if there is more than one) and try to create a distinguishing locative description. A distinguishing locative description is created by using the basic incremental algorithm to distinguish the target landmark from the distractor landmarks. If we succeed in generating a distinguishing locative description we return the description and stop processing.

This process continues until either a distinguishing expression is produced or no possible spatial relations remain. candidate relation in the list of possible relations. The length of this list will be a constant; call it R . For each candidate relation, the number of times the incremental algorithm runs is equal to the number of TL objects (the number of objects which don X  X  fulfill the description of the target created by the current run of the incremental algorithm, and which the target object stands under the currently selected relation to).
Call the number of TL objects n TL an dnote that n TL must be less than, an dproportional to, n (the total number of objects). The number of times the basic incremental algorithm can run, in our system, is then proportional to N TL  X  R ; replacing with n n  X  R runs of the basic incremental algorithm.

However, these descriptions can be generated if needed by replacing the call to the basic incremental algorithm for the landmark object with a call to the whole locative expression algorithm, using the target landmark as the target object and the set of distractor landmarks as the distractors. A nice consequence of this approach to generating embedded locative descriptions is that infinite descriptions (e.g., the bag on the chair supporting the bag on the chair ... ) will not be generate das the target object is excluded from the context that the landmark X  X  description is generated in. However, the cost of being able to generate these embedded descriptions is a higher exponential complexity. 8.2.2 An Example. We can illustrate the framework using the visual context provided by the scene on the left of Figure 29. This context consists of two re dboxes R1 an d 302
R2 an dtwo blue balls B1 an dB2. Imagine that we want to refer to B1. We begin by calling the locative incremental algorithm, Algorithm 2. This in turn calls the basic incremental algorithm, Algorithm 1, which will return the property ball . However, this is not sufficient to create a distinguishing description as B2 is also a ball. In this context the set of candidate landmarks equals { R1,R2 } an dthe first relation in the hierarchy is topological proximity, which we model as described in Section 6.1. The image on the right of Figure 29 illustrates the analysis of the scene using this framework: The green region on the left defines the area deemed to be proximal to R1, and the yellow region on the right defines the area deemed to be proximal to R2. It is evident that B1 is in the area proximal to R1; consequently R1 is classifie das a target lan dmark. As none of the distractors (i.e., B2) are located in a region that is proximal to a candidate landmark there are no distractor landmarks. As a result when the basic incremental algorithm is called to create a distinguishing description for the target landmark R1 it will return box and this will be deemed to be a distinguishing locative description. The overall algorithm will then return the vector { ball, proximal, box realizer generating a reference of the form: the ball near the box . 9. Conclusions and Future Work
In this article we have described the application of computational models of spatial prepositions to visually situated dialog systems. These computational models allow sys-tems to both interpret an dgenerate expressions which refer to topological an dprojective relations between objects in the visual environment. The computational models of spa-tial prepositions we present are designed to handle reference resolution and generation in complex visual environments containing multiple objects. In particular, these models are designed to account for the contextual influence which the presence of multiple objects has on the semantics of topological an dprojective prepositions. In this respect our computational models move beyond other accounts of the semantics of spatial prepositions, which typically do not model the contextual influence of other objects on spatial semantics. Because most real-worl dvisual scenes are complex an dcontain multiple objects, our computational models for the semantics of spatial prepositions are important for visually situated dialog systems intended to operate successfully in the real world.

These prepositions either involve several objects or multiple areas and, consequently, our account of the effect of distractor objects on the target X  X andmark relationship could provide a worthwhile perspective on their semantics.

An important aim for future research is to extend these studies and test the model in situations with multiple distractors. tial prepositions illustrates an important point for researchers working on the semantics of natural language in general: that it is possible to investigate an dmo del semantics not solely as a linguistic phenomenon, but also in terms of non-linguistic factors such as the visual environment in which language is used. For example, in the psychological evaluations described in Section 7 we found that the semantic applicability of  X  X ear X  to the relationship between a target an da lan dmark object was reliably influence dby the presence and location of a third, distractor, object, which was not part of the linguistic context. That the semantics of language is influence dby non-linguistic factors is an ol d point an dan obvious one: however, we think that our research on visually-situate d dialog systems makes a useful contribution by showing that these systems provide ideal testbeds for investigating the interaction between language and vision, and for developing detailed and useful computational models of how those interactions work.
