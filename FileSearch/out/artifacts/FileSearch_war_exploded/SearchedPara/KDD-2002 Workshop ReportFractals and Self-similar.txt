 SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 115 In this repo rt we provide a summ ary of the first workshop on app lication o f self -similarity and fractals in d ata mining: issues and app roaches held in con jun ction with ACM SIGKDD 2002 , July 23 at Edmon ton , Alberta, Canada. Data mining, Fractals, Self -similarity. Human b rains, econo mic markets, network data, earthqu ake activity, music melod ies and n atu re c reate e no rmou sly complex behavior that is much richer than the behavior of the ind ividu al compon ent un its. Self -similar stochastic processes, which introdu ced forty y ears ago, brou ght to the a ttention o f prob abilists and statisticians and they have bee n u sed in h ydrology geoph ysics, bioph ysics, biology, financial econo mics and comm un ication s s ystems. Even rece nt measurements of new ph eno mena such as local -area a nd wide -area traffic, web site traffics and agents' behavior have sho wn self -similarity at a wide range of time scales.
 Rece ntly, several t echn iqu es have been p ropo sed to app ly data mining techn iqu es throu gh fractal dimension s and self -similar characteristics in d ifferent do mains. These techn iqu es includ e bu t no t li mited to: dimension redu ction , p redictive mod eling, using self -similar characteristics to mine databases s uch as association rules, clustering, classification , mod eling and ou tlier discovery, selectivity estimation , spatial databases, R -trees, Quadtrees and mod el distribu tion s of data. A lthou gh fractals and self -similarities in Data Mining have a ttracted researchers' attention , this is s till an op en research issue. We believe that much p rogress cou ld b e achieved from a c on certed effort and a greater amoun t of interaction s between research ers in d ifferent research areas.
 The pu rpo se of this workshop was to p rovide a forum to foster such interaction s, discuss the new achievements and identify future research d irection s. Hence, to h igh light these e fforts we organized the first workshop on ap plication o f self -similarity and fractals in d ata mining held in con jun ction with ACM SIGKDD 2002 .
 The program of the workshop includ ed o f introdu ctory talk, an invited talk, six con tribu ted p apers and a panel at the e nd o f the program. The on -line procee d ings for the invited p apers are available a t: www .isi.edu /~adibi/FratalKDD 02 .htm. The introdu ction b y Christos Falou tsos (CMU) gave the definition of fractals, some e xamples like the Sierpinski triangle, and made the ob servation that fractals and po wer la ws are c losely related and at the e nd h e op ened the floo r for the rest of the program. In h is invited talk Jon Kleiberg (Cornell) talked abou t t he Information Networks, Power Laws, and Small -World Pheno mena. On the information n etwork he stat ed that if we were to generate a rando m graph on n nod es by includ ing eac h po ssible edge ind epend ently with some prob abilit y p, then the fraction o f nod es with d neighbo rs wou ld d ecrease e xpon entially in d . But for many large networks includ ing the Web, th e Internet, collabo ration n etworks, and semantic networks it qu ickly beca me clear that the fraction o f nod es with d n eighbo rs decreases on ly po lyno mially in d ; to pu t it differently, the distribu tion o f degrees ob eys a po wer law. What processes are ca pable of generating such po wer laws, and why shou ld they be ub iqu itou s in large networks? The investigation o f these qu estion s s uggests that po wer laws are just on e reflection o f the local and glob al processes driving the e volution o f these networks.
 He c on tinu ed h is talk by discussion o f link analysis with the goal of searching for and ranking high -qu ality con tent. A lot of the method s to do this, ho wever, un cover r icher structure in the network -densely conn ected comm un ities focused on a particular top ic. The prob lem of un covering such comm un ity structure differs in some interesting ways from the heavily stud ied p rob lems of clustering and graph p artiti on ing rather than trying to decompo se the full network into a few piece s, the goal i s to identify small, dense ly conn ected region s that even pu t together may no t acc oun t for much o f the who le graph .
 The talk con tinu ed with o verview on the a mazing small -world ph eno mena, the principle that we a re a ll li nked b y sho rt chains of acqu aintances. This ob servation was inau gurated as an area of experimental stud y in the social sciences throu gh the pion eering work of Stanley Milgram in the 1960 's. He sho wed that no dece ntralized algorithm, op erating with local i nformation on ly, can con struct sho rt paths in these networks with non -negligible prob abilit y. He defined an infinite family of network mod els that SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 116 naturally generalizes the Watts -Strogatz mod el, and sho wed that for on e of these mod els, there is a dece ntralized algorithm capable of f ind ing sho rt paths with h igh p rob abili ty. In general he provided a stron g characterization o f this family of network mod els, sho wing that there is in fact a un iqu e mod el within the family for which d ece ntralized algorithms are e ffective . He a lso mention ed that small -world n avigation mod el t o p ower -law distribu tion s in which nod es kno w the degree of their neighbo rs; affects the sub -linear search time a nd facilit ates the simultaneou s search. The talked wrapp ed up b y overview on op en issues and po ssible future work in this field. The c on tribu ted p apers s pann ed a series of interesting top ics which is listed as following. Jafar Adibi (USC/ISI), Wei -Min Shen (USC/ISI) and Eaman Noo rbakhsh (CALT ECH/JPL) provided a review on fractal s and self -similarity for advance a pp lication includ ing Agent Theory, Self -Similar Layered Hidd en Markov Mod el and Link Discovery.
 Jafar Adibi argued that a lon g lasting qu estion , still i n d ebate amon g multi -agent system researchers, is ho w to qu antitative ly measure the a moun t of "teamwork" in a multi -agent system. Previou s attempts are mostly qu alitative a nd in some ca ses ad ho c, and h ave no t provided any satisfactory solution s. In h is talk he provided p reliminary results of his no vel techn iqu e to measure the fractal dimension o f a multi -agent system, and sho wed that such a measurement is directly related to the a moun t of teamwork in the system. He a lso p resented h is ob servation o f Robo Cup simulation league (agents playing socce r in a simulated environ ments ) that despite the c omplicated b ehaviors of the synthetic a gents in this dynamic do main, agents' behaviors are self -similar ( i.e., macro and micro structures are reflected in eac h o ther) and the fractal measurements in their behaviors are directly related to the team strategies in the c ompetiti on s. He a lso introdu ced Self -Similar Layered HMM and illustrated that it i s a better estimation than flat Hidd en Markov Mod el when data sho ws s elf -similar prop erty and exploit t his prop erty to redu ce the c omplexity o f mod el con struction . . He sho wed ho w the e mbedd ed kno wledge of self -similar structure ca n b e used to redu ce the c omplexity of learning and increase the acc uracy of the learned mod el. In add ition h e e xplained three different types of self -similarity alon g with some result on synthetic data a nd experiments on Network data The last app lication introdu ced b y Jafar Adibi was his new ob servation in Link Discovery prob lem. He illustrated that t he distribu tion o f the nu mber of links/info/activities associate with agents in a real world d atabase e nviron ments s ho ws ZIPF law X  X  distribu tion . This information cou ld b e e mployed to answer different qu estion s in link discovery prob lem such as classification , clustering and ob ject con solidation . Many real -life datasets have a large nu mber of f eatures s ome of which are often h ighly correlated. This is referred to as the c urse of dimension ality in d ata mining literautes. Elena Eneva (CMU), Krishn a Kumaraswamy ( CMU) and Matteo Matteucci (CMU) investigated the relation ship amon g several dimension ality redu ction method s and the intrinsic dimension ality of the data in the redu ced space , as estimated b y the fractal dimension . They sho wed that a succe ssful dimension al ity redu ction /feature extraction algorithm projects the data into a feature space with the dimension ality close to the intrinsic dimension ality of the data in the original space a nd p reserves topo logical prop erties.
 In add ition , they provided a c omparative stud y between the dimension ality redu ction techn iqu es using fractal dimension and other well -kno wn techn iqu es s uch as principle c ompon ent analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA) and self -sup ervised multi layer perceptron . Changhao Jiang (CMU), Yiheng Li (CMU), Minglon g Shao (CMU) and Peng Jia (CMU) attacked the prob lem of clustering of large high d imension al datasets. They presented a new fractal -based sampling too l to acce lerate prevailing clust ering method s in two aspects: 1) as a preprocessing step to iteratively sample the original dataset into critical -size of dataset; 2) advising clustering method s with critical i npu t parameters which is s pecific to different method s. The key idea of their work is based on the a ssumption that id a samples s ub set has s imilar  X  X elf -plot X  to that of original dataset, then it preserve original datasets X  distribu tion p attern and can b e used in p lace of original dataset for clustering. With this assumption a fract al -based sampling too l i s add ed as a preprocessing step b efore c lustering. A given large high dimension al dataset first goes throu gh this s ampling too l and is redu ced to critical sized sub set is fed into a c lustering method . The preprocessing step redu ces dataset X  X  s ize a nd it advises succe ssive c lustering method with some c ritical inpu t parameters which are ob tained throu gh  X  X elf -plot X  a nalysis. Their experimental result of app lying such too l with BIRC H clustering method suggests the too l X  X  effectiveness a nd app licabilit y in bo th aspects. In add ition they illustrated their experiments on OPTICS and CURE clustering techn iqu es in which bo th result were po sitive. Over the last few years, th e network comm un ity has s tarted to rely heavily on the use of no vel con cepts s uch as fractals, self -similarity, lon g -range depend ence a nd po wer -laws. Especially evidence of fractals, self -similarity and lon g -range depend ence in network traffic have been wi dely ob served. Despite their wide use, there is s till much con fusion regarding the identification o f such ph eno mena in real network traffic data. For on e, the Hurst expon ent can no t be ca lculated in a definitive way, it can on ly be estimated. Second , there are several different method s to estimate the Hurst expon ent, bu t they often p rodu ce c on flicting estimates. It is no t clear which o f the e stimators provides the most acc urate estimation . In this extend ed abstract, we make a first step towards a systematic app roach in estimating self -similarity and lon g -range depend ence. Tho mas Karagiann is (UCR ) and Michalis Falou tsos (UCR ) presented a java based too l called SELFIS that will automate the SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 117 self -similarity analysis. SELFIS is the first attempt t o create a sta nd -alon e, free, op en -sou rce platform to facilit ate self -similarity analysis. They sho wed the use of SELFIS and d escribed the methodo logies that currently incorpo rate in real Internet data. In add ition , they presented an intuitive a pp roach to validate the e xistence of lon g -range depend ence.
 SELFIS facilit ates practiti on ers by providing practical ways for lon g -range depend ence e stimation and it can b ecome a reference po int i n estimating lon g -range depend ence in time -series. A nu mber of different estimators th at capture variou s features of lon g -range depend ent behavior is provided b y the software. One of the c hallenges when d ealing with multimedia information , which u sually is massive a nd comp osed o f multidimension al data, is ho w to ind ex, cluster and retain on ly the relevant information amon g the items of a large database. In o rder to redu ce the information to the meaningful data, techn iqu es s uch as attribu te selection h ave been u sed. Some of the well -kno wn d imension ality redu ction techn iqu es are the principal compon ent analysis (PCA) and the singular value decompo sition (SVD). These techn iqu es either map the data sets to o ther space s or generate a set of add ition al axes. However, this is no t q uite a ttribu te selection . Elaine Parros Machado d e Sou sa (University of Sao Paulo), Caetano Traina Jr. (University of Sao Paulo), Agma J. M. Traina (University of Sao Paulo) and Christos Falou tsos (CMU) presented a no vel t echn iqu e to d iscover group s of cor related attribu tes in a data set, using the fractal dimension con cept. They also p resented an algorithm to find correlation group s that i s linear on the nu mber of attribu tes and on the nu mber of elements in the data set. These techn iqu es represents an impo rtant achievement on find ing information abou t a data set, as it can discover if there is more than on e group o f attribu tes that establishes the c orrelation s in the data set, and also identify the attribu tes that pertain to eac h group . The result of such t echn iqu e can b e e mployed (1) to find a sub set of the a ttribu tes that, besides con cisely representing the data, can b e used when creating ind exes or app lying data mining techn iqu es over the data withou t compromising the results; (2) to establish which attri bu tes are correlated b etween them. The significant characteristic of bu rsty traffic is s elf -similarity. Self -similarity is the main reason for ob serving so called bu rst within bu rst patterns acro ss a wide range of time scales as on e of the un iqu e c haracteristics of non linear systems with fractal nature. Perceptron n eural networks, beca use of their non linear nature a nd simple method o f learning, provide a po werful t oo l t o mod el bu rsty traffic patte rns. Homayoun You sefi'zadeh (UCI) stud ied mod eling of self -similar traffic patterns with a multi -pu rpo se fixed structure system, i.e, a neural network. He investigated p erceptron n eural networks and back prop agation learning algorithm for the task of mod e ling. He used a fixed structure neural network with three hidd en layers in order to mod el sou rce -and aggregated -level traffic patterns. The neural network had eight neuron s in its inpu t layer, and twenty neuron s in eac h o f its three hidd en layers. The nu m ber of neuron s in its ou tpu t layer was on e. He a pp lied eight con secutive samples of the pattern as the inpu t of the network and u sed the ninth sample a s the desired ou tpu t i n eac h iteration o f the learning algorithm. He utili zed n eural networks in mod eling artificially generated self -similar traffic patterns by intermittency family of chaotic maps. The nu mber of samples requ ired for the training of the fixed structure neural network depend ed on the steady state behavior of the traffic pattern and the networ k load. For the learning ph ase he made use of enh anced b ack prop agation learning algorithm to sho rten the learning ph ase a fter which the network was able to p redict t he sequ ential samples of the correspond ing traffic pattern within an error bound . At the e nd h e followed eac h reca lling ph ase with a training ph ase to b e a ble to cop e with the divergent behavior of the trained n eural network and p rovided some intuitive reason ing relying on sensitivity to the variation s of initial cond ition s argument discussed i n chaos theory to explain the ob served d ivergent behavior We wou ld like to thank workshop invited speaker Prof. Jon Kleinb erg, autho rs, panelists and p articipants for con tribu ting to the succe ss of the workshop .
