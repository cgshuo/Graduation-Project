 We provide an overview of the world largest industrial OCR application: Postal Address Re ading. We will talk about its humble beginnings and will elabor ate how it evolved rapidly to high-tech machinery and discuss its future prospects. Some prominent historical-, system-, methodological-, cultural-and social aspects will also be illuminated. Every day, millions of mail pieces are automatically sorted and distributed based on a powerful fl eet of readers, which recognize millions of characters and words per second and recombine them to meaningful and valid addresse s. Cheques and paper forms will vanish sooner or later, since they can be completely replaced by electronic cash flow and e-forms. Mail, however, will persist and even grow in volume for three good reasons: First, mail is conjoined with goods and material, especially in the era of web-shopping. Second, Postal Services are the only world comprising service reaching even the most remote places in the world. Third, postal services will undergo a hybr idization process, which means that mail and email will fuse to hybrid mail. Hybrid mail will reach the recipient in the appropriate form according to the recipients preferences, no matter, if it was sent as letter, fax or email. Systems Applications H.4.2 Types of Systems, Logistics Reliability, Languages, Theory, Verification Keywords: Hidden Markov Models, Hybrid voice, Mult-Expert-Approach, Multiline Reader, OCR, PTAL, Polynomial classifiers, Postal Address Reading, statistical machine learning History: The genesis of Postal Address Reading is astounding: Thirty years ago, in 1978, the first prototype, PTAL, by AEG, now part of SIEMENS, was set into operation in the Postal Mail Center in Wiesbaden, Germany  X  after a decade of intensive R&amp;D. It was able to read the destination town and postal code. Initially, PTAL was only able to read machine print -about one hundred different typewriter fonts  X  at a moderate recognition rate of around 50%. A few years later, street and house number in the destination town followed, providing information about the delivery point to which the letter shall be sent. This was less a challenge for the OCR but for the database, since it had to grow from several thousand to several million entries, according to the street names and house numbers all over the country. Soon the Multiline Reader, MLOCR, followed, interpreting the full address, including company and private names. MLOCR was quickly an international success. In the Nineties more than thousand MLOCRs were in operat ion in the US alone. The next great milestone was the readi ng of senders X  addresses and endorsement lines for automatic forwarding. Great efforts were made to capture and evaluate every piece of information on the envelope, front and back, as well as the six sides of a parcel, no matter how they were represented, as printed or handwritten text, as graphic symbols, or as image. As a result, nowadays, all available information is read and interpreted including stamps, postage meter marks, labels, and trademark logos, to account for mail class, to control the postage and to prevent fraud etc. At the same time, services advanced from standard tasks to exception handling of incorrectly addressed items or undeliverable items and from legible to nearly illegible addresses and connected cursive script, reaching a read performance of 95% and more. Mail with addresses that are not automatically readable are presented to video encoders. But even this process is not done completely manually. It is supported by OCR highlighting the specific missing or ambiguous part of information leading to a minimum System: Postal Address Reading is a success story of pattern recognition par excellence . It is a microcosm of its own and it contains solutions for all partial problems and aspects encountered on the long way from pixel to m eaning under real time conditions. Postal Address Reading is like an organism which first perceives a target, recognizes it, then concludes what to do  X  and finally acts. Speaking in technical terms, this means image capturing, image preprocessing, layout analysis , finding regions of interest, converting images into clear text, using optical character and word recognition, analyzing its syntax , and disclosing its semantic context by use of address inte rpretation methods and dedicated fast retrieval techniques such as associative access to large databases. All these subordinate steps exclusively serve one ambitious goal: to reconstruct th e intention of an unknown writer  X  you can X  X  ask the writer if in doubt  X  and to verify this information with the nearest data entry available in the knowledge database using an ade quate distance measure. Finally, a chain of diverters in the sorting equipment are activated in order to guide the mail item safely into the right bin. Methodology: The great breakthrough in mail reading came with statistical approaches and machine learning, such as polynomial classifiers, neural nets, support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and directed and undire cted graph models including conditional random fields (CRF). A set of transforms like principal access-(PAT), Fourier-, Hough-transform etc. are used that outperform hand-designed heur istic approaches for feature extraction. Fast directory access has been crucial from the very beginning. Refined retrieval methods and semantic relations have been of equal importance. Current research focuses on data mining, semantic mode ling and the fusion of classical document analysis with knowledge discov ery. General trend has always been, that efficient top down approaches replaced simpler, data driven, and much more computational intensive bottom-up approaches. The most successful approach proved to be the opportunistic top down approach , preventing to calculate superfluous parts of information on the envelope, always having the information of interest in the scope. Only in case of failure a flexible back propagation method st eps back to last secure point and calculates the next probable alternative path until the case is resolved -or alternatives are exhausted. Future prospects: Sensor fusion and hybrid multi-expert recognition systems with statistically based voters will make Postal Services more efficient. A first introduction of a combined Voice and OCR system called Hybrid Voice was introduced at Royal Mail  X  where, metaphorically speaking, the  X  X lind X  (voice recognizer analyzing spoken addresses) supports the  X  X eaf X  (OCR) -with great success. Fr om now on, Christmas parcels could be delivered without delay. Technically seen, two stages of imperfect recognition were cascaded, the first reducing the search space for the second  X  and lead to a very satisfying total recognition rate, well above the 90%. For a long time all kinds of barc odes have been recognized. Plain Barcodes, in fact, stem from the pre-OCR era. The new idea is now to get rid of the  X  X gly barcode s X  and to identify mail pieces by detecting a unique set of feat ures for each individual piece  X  called  X  X ingerprint technology X . Another innovation is the Learning Directory, which enables the postal services to semi-automatically update their database s: It filters out and ranks every address occurring on mail envelopes, which is missing in the database and vice versa, it dete cts obsolete entries which never occur on mail envelopes and po llute the address database. Learning Directory can be us ed for improving an existing database or for building it up from scratch, e.g. if a new postal customer decides to switch from manual to automated operation, or from a lower level to a higher of sorting. Postal world and telecommunicati on will merge and enable new services and a seamless view of mail, may it be postal mail, email or hybrid mail. Mobile devices will play an increasing role and new services will allow to track and control the individual mail  X  like in a web forum the end customer will be able to enroll and receive only personally desired information. Cultural: Meanwhile, the address reader got polyglot, and masters many language s and alphabets, am ong them Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Cyrillic, and He brew, and of cause all country specific variations of Latin. Virtually any alphabet can be recognized after training. With rega rd to machine pr int it X  X  easy to generate training data from font CDs. For handwriting, however, it X  X  much more tedious to get the training and validation set, a prerequisite for statistical machine learning. But click workers, on web platforms like Mturk, or Huma nGrid, will make labeled data available at reasonable costs. Social: Finally a nice anecdote illustrating the robustness and flexibility of postal automation. After hurricane Katrina hit SW USA in August 2005, USPS servic e was the first service that restarted their service: Thanks to the automatic forwarding functionality and its flexible way to re-route mail pieces according to new redirection addresses -it brought the care parcels, temporarily stored in large intermediate store buildings, to the evacuated people in gym halls.
