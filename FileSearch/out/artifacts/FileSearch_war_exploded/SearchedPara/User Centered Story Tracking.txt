 Using news provider services available on the Internet has for many people become the main medium for staying informed about the world. Such services support Internet users in story tracking : following the news developments over time. We regard a story as a set of time-stamped documents de-scribing correlated subjects, such as for example persons, event descriptions, and topics. Story tracking differs from  X  X egular X  search, and should go beyond retrieving the most relevant documents, and refine the search results describing novel subjects of a story. These novel subjects are bursty (appearing significantly more frequently in a time window of search than in other time) content elements, for example: words, word n-grams, and sentences. Text-oriented versions of the story tracking task have been described in the TAC Update Summarization and TREC Novelty Detection and Adaptive Filtering tasks. Recently a number of methods have focused on mining for lower-level sub-sentential pat-terns. We refer to these approaches collectively as temporal text mining (TTM). Works in these areas are mostly con-cerned with the system side algorithms and automatic eval-uation procedures. In this work we put emphasis on the users, and go beyond automatic algorithm evaluation by in-cluding users in the story tracking process and assessing how different approaches aid them in this process.

When tracking a story users have two main goals: (1) story understanding and (2) story search. The goal of story understanding is to comprehend the story X  X  subjects and track their evolution. In order to achieve this, users will want to inspect the story as well as the underlying documents ( story search ). Here, finding the most relevant documents is only a means to the (generally more important) end of dis-covering the change and their evolution and comprehending the general the story development. This situation calls for systems that: (a) identify important subjects and their sub-structure, (b) show how these substructures emerge, change, and disappear over time, and (c) give users intuitive inter-faces for interactively exploring the story landscape and at the same time the underlying document. The user should not be exposed to well-formatted, predefined and global pat-terns from a machine intelligence system, but should be an integral part of information processing. Following this idea, we have built an interactive semi-automatic visual tool for story tracking. We developed a method for bursty-patterns detection based on the increase the in frequency of normal-ized bi-gram co-occurrences, and then use the discovered patterns to build a visual summarization as a graph. In-teracting with the the graph enables users to build topics, or focus on entities they are interested in, and discover the  X  X acts X  behind the changes in a story. To test our methods we created two corpora comprising of a time-stamped set of documents and a set of editor-created  X  X round-truth X  refer-ence sentences. The developed tool and test procedures aim to answer following research questions: ( Q 1): Does the pro-posed graphical representation improve user comprehension and navigation of stories? ( Q 2): Can the proposed burst dis-covery algorithm based on local patterns be used for story tracking? ( Q 3): How can different bursty-pattern represen-tation be used for discovering the underlying  X  X acts X  behind the changes in document sets? ( Q 4): How can users benefit from methods and interfaces for story tracking? ( Q 5): How should the documents be ordered for story tracking?
The main contributions of our so far carried out research to answer these questions are: (a) model story tracking as an interactive task [ ? ], (b) define an evaluation framework for TTM methods, and (c) build tools for supporting story tracking [ ? ]. The developed tool 1 and the new evaluation techniques, will let us carry out novel user experiments.
