 In recent years, tagging systems have been paid increasing attentions from both research communities and system designers. Most popular online social networking sites harness tag for managing and locating contents, for organizing and connecting users, and for recommending and sharing resources. We believe that tag acts like bridge between people and resources. Research on tag and tagging behavior will pr ovide us insight about resource space and user activities on the Intern et. In this paper, we present a two-level analysis of the tagging system of Del.icio.us. The results from both two levels confirm each other. In network level, we connect tags by users collaborative tagging to form a social network of tags. By investigati ng its network feature, we find phenomena of small world and scale-free network. We also discover that the links within this network have relatively strong semantic relatedness. In individua l level, users X  tagging behaviors and patterns are observed by visualizing their bookmarking history on Del.icio.us. Besides, we study the linked users by their tags and find that users within a subscription network share more common interests than random pairs of users. During the analysis, we also discuss the implications of the findings for the design of tag-based system. C.2.3 [ Computer-Communication Networks ]: Network Operations  X  Network management. H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services  X  Web-based services. Measurement, human factors Tag, social annotation, scale -free, small world, semantic relatedness, visualization, Del.icio.us. Social networking sites like Flickr , Youtube and Del.icio.us have been rapidly gaining popularity on the Internet, underscoring a transformation of the Web to a participatory medium in which users are actively creating, evaluating and distributing information. With this proce ss, tagging systems, which allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resources using descriptive tags, have enjoyed phenomenal success in recent years. And tag, a kind of use r-created annotation, has drawn plenty attentions from both research community and industry. Tags are user-defined descriptor s that can be any string assigned to target resources. They're a little bit like keywords but non-hierarchical, and can be freely c hosen by the user without any a-priori dictionary, taxonomy, or ontology to conform to. Tagging technique provides a powerful me thod for managing and locating contents, for organizing and connecting users, and for recommending and sharing resources on social networks based sites [1]. For example, users of Flickr harness tags to manage their photos and to explore other interesting photos; On Del.ic io.us, tags are used to help users organize, share, and discover bookmarks. We believe tag is among the essen tial components of online social networks and is deserved to be studied. Tag is users X  description on resources. It acts as the conn ection between people's subjective cognition and objective information. Investigating tag can reveal many properties of both user characteristics and resource space: What words would people usually use to describe a certain set of resources? How do people extract subject and keyword from a document? How do resources connect with each other from the people who use them will be helpful not only for designing applications but also for resolving many research problems. In this paper, we focus on studying the following questions: 1. How does the whole tag space look like? What kind of properties it has? 2. Does the connection between tags contain semantic information? 3. For a certain user, what are hi s/her patterns of tagging behavior? 4. On a certain resource (bookmar k), how do tags evolve with time? 5. Will the users' connection reflect their interests or influence their choice? To investigate these problems, we pick Del.icio.us as our data source. Del.icio.us is one of the most popular online bookmarking sites with more than three million users and 100 million bookmarked URLs [2]. It provides user a viable and effective mechanism to organize Web res ources via bookmark. Bookmarks include links to users X  favorite articles, blogs, music, reviews, recipes, etc. Each bookmark records the web page X  X  URL and its are used to describe the bookmarks posted by users. When saving or editing a bookmark, there is a fi eld for tags, as shown in Figure 2. Collaborative tagging happens when users add their own tags to the same URLs independently. Del.icio.us is an ideal choice for us because it has accumulated plenty data of users and tags. We collect publicly accessible data from Del.icio.us to form the dataset. Our analysis has two levels. In network level, we measure the statistical properties of social networ ks formed by tags to verify if the network has characteristics of small world and scale-free. We also try to find out whether se mantic relatedness remains in network connections by examini ng the semantic distance between linked tags. In individual level, we study the tagging behavior of user. Sometimes it X  X  difficult to observe the patterns from the large text data of tags. So we adopt some visualization methods which are proved to be useful to explore and explain information, to display long textual sequen ces through simple color coding schemes and to reveal some structur al properties of users X  tagging. The main contribution of this pape r has three aspects. First, we treat the tag space as a social network, perform analysis of complex network on tag graph, a nd study the semantic relatedness between tags. Second, we use vi sualization methods to help analyze tagging activities of users and find some patterns of tagging. Third, we investigate th e relationship between users by examining their social annotations. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: We provide additional background and related wo rk in Section 2. The network level analysis will be conducted in Section 3, and individual level analysis in Section 4. Finally, we conclude with plans for future work in Section 5. Online social networks are already at the heart of some very popular web sites. Within online social networking sites, tagging systems allow users to interactively annotate a pool of shared resources using descriptive ta gs. Tag is a kind of social annotation. Annotation, the meta data describing Web resources, can be generated by machine automatically. For example, Dill [11] described an application performing automated semantic tagging of large corpora; Chirita [12] described a method called P-TAG which automatically genera ted personalized tags for Web pages; Cimiano [13] proposed a method which employed an unsupervised, pattern-based approach to provide annotation. Annotation can also be manually made by Web users without a pre-defined formal ontology. This kind of annotation is usually called "social annotation". The word "social" emphasizes the fact that these annotations are made by a large number of normal Web users with implicit social inter actions on the open Web without a pre-defined formal ontology [14]. Social annotation is important networking services. Although some people thought the creation of social annotation had probl ems caused by ambiguity and synonymy [16], many works showed that social annotations were more accessible for users and could better reflect the content of resource from the users X  point of view. For example, Szomszor [15] integrated tags harvested from the Internet Movie Database and movie rating data gathered by Net fl ix to provide a basis for prediction of rating for a previously unseen movie. Nickles [18] thought that semantic web as an open information environment could benefit a lot from social annotation. In [17], the authors stated advantages of social annotation as low barrier to entry, dynamic information, and decentralization. Users tag resources with various purposes [19]. Li [20] thought tagging was not only a method fo r organizing contents to facilitate the users who created it, but also a navigation mechanism for users to disc over interesting resources. Collaborative tagging describes the process by which many users add metadata upon shared content. Collaborative tagging offers an alternative to current efforts at semantic web ontologies [19]. In [12], the author believed that the successful application of the tagging paradigm could be seen as a lowercase semantic web. One can then build upon this lowercase semantic web as a basis for the introduction of more sema ntics, thus advancing further towards the Web 2.0 ideas. Golder [21] analyzed the structure of collaborative tagging systems, as well as their dynamic aspects, and discovered regularities in us ers X  activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, and bursts of popularity in bookmarking. We model tag space as a social network. A long thread of researches has examined the structure of social networks. It was put forward by Watts and Strogatz that many real world networks had large clustering coefficients with short average path lengths, and networks with these two prope rties were called "small world" networks [45]. Subsequently it was proposed by Albert et al. [22, 23] that many real world networks had power law degree distributions, and denoted as "s cale free" networks. Scale-free characteristics have been found in many real-world networks [24-26]. The structural properties of online social network have given research communities much enlightenment on improving current services on the Internet. H X lzer [7] used social network constructed from email data mined from the Internet to detect email alias. In [8], author ar gued that search techniques could benefit from contents of social networks. In [9], Yu proposed a method to defend against Sybil attacks via social networks. Hogg [10] harnessed structure of social networks to enhance the trust in economic transactions. Some analyses in this paper u tilize visualization methods. Graphic representations help people gras p the meaning of information more easily and quickly [27]. Especially, when data are large or abstract, visualization can help make data easier to read or understand. For example, Weiskopf [28] used explanatory general relativity to non-physicists. Recently, there have emerged many visualization methods upon Web data [29, 30]. Visualization has been also us ed upon social annotation. Dubinko [31] proposed a method to visualize the evolution of tags on Flickr. Dekker [32] provided algorithms to visualize the social networks with different layouts. In this section, we examine the characteristics of tag network by investigating the structural properties of graph with the theory of complex network. Although the usage of tagging technology has been studied by many researchers, there is little effort to treat tags as a social network and investigate it from the view of complex network. We believe understanding of socio-gram of tags can give some insight into human X  X  usage of words in describing Web resources and provides us an opportunity to analyze the connections and relationships of participating users and resources in online social networks. So un like the user-centric approaches such as [4], here we use tag-centr ic approach to recognize a social network, in which participating nodes are all tags. In our opinion, tag acts as a bridge in three occasions within social bookmarking sites like Del.icio.us: 1. Tag connects users and res ources. It X  X  users X  subjective description on objective resources. Tag provides a mechanism for users to find resources and for resources to associate with users. For example, a user can conveni ently find all his/her bookmarks about software through the tag of "software". 2. Tag connects resources. Different resources can share a common tag and are thus clustere d. In social bookmarking system like Del.icio.us, URLs are linked by tags, and users can find other bookmarks that may interest them from the current bookmark X  X  tags. So tag provides a way to discover similar and useful resources. 3. Tag connects users. Users ar e linked by collaboration tagging and are able to share resources. By this way, they can find users having similar interest via shared tags. We combine these three connections and extract the relationships between tags from them, as shown in Figure 3, and thus form a network of tags X  connection. More specifically, the link between tags is decided by users X  collaborative tagging. We believe that if two tags are frequently used together by people to descri be some resources, they seem to have some intrinsic relatedness. The idea is similar to "association rules" described in [33, 34], that if many transactions contain both two items, these two have association. Here, if there are many bookmarks with both tag A and tag B, we will connect the two in network graph. With this method, these connected tags form a network, as shown in Figure 4, upon which we can use theory of complex network to analyze its statistical properties. Different tags are used to descri be a same URL in del.icio.us for some reasons: 1. Tags with the same or simila r meaning are picked by users X  "howto"/"tutorial" could be used by different users towards same thing in tagging. Moreover, one person X  X  tag usage might not be consistent, due to the arbitrarine ss in tagging. For example, a user might interchangeably use both tags of "programming" and "development" to describe res ources with similar topics at different time. Besides, tags can also be different spellings (e.g. "peer_to_peer"), and plural (e.g. "photo" and "photos") of the same thing. 2. Tags can be words describing similar topics with different scope, such as "java" and "j2ee" , which share many bookmarks in hierarchical structures, where one tag may fall under the category presented by the other. From the view of linguistics, the distance between these words is relatively short. 3. Tags are descriptions of the sa me target from different point of views. For example, a site may have tags of both "blog" and "photo", indicating it X  X  a blog with interesting photos. The distance between these words of tags are relatively long, and the connections are difficult to be found in traditional dictionary approach. However, these diverse descriptions can effectively reveal the content and function of resources. For example, the set of tags of google (e.g. "searchengi ne", "portal", and "email") can list services of google and rate their importance from the users X  view. 4. Some tags about personal knowledge organization and self-referential notes are commonly associated with other tags. For example, "toread" or "todo" may be used by multiple users on bookmarks and then conn ect with other tags. 5. Some tags are used for desc ribing creators X  emotional feeling and subjective rating on resources. For example, "good" is used by many people, and top 5 associ ated tags of "good" are "blog", "web", "design", "software", and "gallery". 6. Tags contain words of di fferent languages with similar meanings. Other than these kinds of connec tions, there might be some other situations for tags existing on same resources, some are even very arbitrary. However, although each tagging behavior seems somehow irregular, the collaborative tagging and resulting tag space show some identifiable features. So we exact those connections between tags and analyze them. We use crawler to obtain those publicly accessible bookmarks X  page on Del.icio.us, exact tags al ong with their links, and form an entire graph of tags. Our craw ling algorithm uses breadth-first search as shown below: P is a set of popular tags, which are gathered from Del.icio.us X  page of "popular tag" (http://del.icio.us/tag) and used as "seed" tags for search. set of unprocessed tags while K is the set of processed tags. C contains all the conn ections between tags. 1: P T  X  2:  X   X  K 3:  X   X  C 4: for all tag T t  X  do 5: for all bookmarks b of t do 6: for all tags ' t of b do 7: if K t  X  ' 8: } ' { t T T  X   X  9: end if 10: )} ' , {( t t C C  X   X  11: end for 12: end for 13: } { t T T  X   X  14: end for Here we X  X e adopted a kind of snowball method and used popular tags on Del.icio.us as "seed" tags . We choose them because they have large amount of bookmarks and will help our crawler quickly access other tags. Snowball method is efficient to collect samples of social networks but has the risk to leave those isolated nodes out [35]. So we verify the result to make sure what we X  X e obtain covers most part of tags  X  graph. We randomly chose a set of users, collected all their tags (275 users, 1955 tags), and found that we had already crawled 92.6% of tags, showing our method covered the vast majority of the tags population. The connection between the tags should be strong enough with a threshold filter out those below  X  , which is set to 10 as an empirical value. With this method we translate the valued connection to binary connection, because we only care if there is relationship between two tags. The result sets contai ns over 5 million bookmarks, with 88781 unique tags and 2593723 connections between them. Based on our data source, we will conduct some measurements of features of tag network. "tools", "music", "web2.0", "bl og", and "design") are also the most popular tags on Del.icio.us. This is reasonable, because those tags used by many people have high possibility to be associated with other tags. On the other side, the result indicates important for other tags (with more links to others) Besides, we list those pairs of tags with most connections in Table 1. We could see that: 1. They are all popular tags, which reflect popular interest on the Internet. The words like "web2.0" , "software" and "blog" are among the most popular topics in the visage of the Internet. 2. These pairs of tags have sim ilar meanings or strong semantic relatedness. For example, the relationships among "design", "webdesign" and "css" are very cl ose. And "mac" is one of the most important products of "Apple". Next, we will examine whether th e network has the characteristic of small world network. Th e small world phenomena, a combination of short average path lengths over the entire graph and a strong degree of  X  X lique-like X  local neighborhoods, have evolved independently in many large networks. The average path length of the ne twork is defined as the mean distance between two nodes, averaged over all pairs of nodes, where the distance between two node s is defined as the number of edges along the shortest path connecting them. We found the average path length in tag network graph is 6.97, which is relatively short and similar to those popular online social networks with small-world proper ties [36], as shown in Table 2. 
Table 2. Average path length of tag network and other online *The data of Flickr, LiveJour nal, Youtube, and Web are from [36]. Another characteristic of small world network is high clustering coefficient, which quantifies how densely the neighborhood of a node is connected. In most large networks, a very large proportion neighborhoods. That is, the dens ity in local neighborhoods of large graphs tends to be much higher than we would expect for a random graph of the same size. The clustering coefficient C of a node with N neighbors is defined as the number of links E that exist between the node X  X  neighbors, divided by the number of possible links that could exist between the node X  X  neighbors: The clustering coefficient of a graph is the average clustering coefficient of all its nodes. We find the clustering coefficient of tags X  network is 0.196. This value is three orders of magnit ude larger than its corresponding random graphs, and is similar to t hose of social networks of users from popular social networking sites with small world feature, as shown in Table 3. Table 3. Clustering coefficient of tag network and other online *The data of Flickr, LiveJourna l, Youtube, and Web are from [36]. Short average path length and high clustering coefficient indicate the tags X  space having the characteristic of small world network. The small world feature is caused by users X  collaborative tagging. Tagging activities are done by many different users, who have their own usage behaviors of tags and opinions towards resources. Tags are connected by users X  collective intelligence. Plentiful links cause the tags to be compac tly connected and the network to have short path length. Beside s, tagging behaviors are more arbitrary compared to formal ed iting jobs, which brings a lot of extra links between words that can X  X  be found in dictionary. Now we will examine whether tag network has the property of scale-free network. The degree of a node is usually defined as the potentially more important the node may be in a network. Scale-free (free of any characteristic scal e) networks are characterized by a power law degree distribution with the probability that a node has k links is proportional to  X   X  k , for large k and This relationship can be seen in a log-log plot of the resulting degree distribution. Figure 5 is th e result of tag network. We find  X  is 1.52, which indicates it X  X  a scale-free network. According to the principle of gr owth and preferential attachment [22], the network continuously grows by the addition of new nodes, and new nodes are then preferentially attached to existing nodes with large numbers of connections. Here, scale-free property of tag network might be formed because: 1. The "hub" tags are the set of words that can represent the popular content on the Internet. For example, the most popular tags, such as "photo", "blog", "s oftware", and "tools", reflect the high proportion of these topics and resources on the Web. 2. The "hub" tags are the set of words that are heavily used in common usage by human or can best describe the target resource. For example, "education" is more used by people than "pedagogy". 3. The "hub" tags have better pos ition to be found by users. For example, the existing popular tags have higher possibility to be suggested by tag suggestion system and chosen by user to describe new added resources. The existence of small world and scale-free network implies that information will rapidly spread through the entire network. In small world and scale-free network, typically there is an over-abundance of hubs with a high number of connections. These hubs serve as the common connecti ons mediating the short path lengths between other edges. The short distance between tags indicates that tag provides an effective way to explore and discover resources (such as bookmarks in Del.icio.us). With traditional method, the connections between resources are difficult to be found. However, with tags that have short path to others, users can conveniently navigate among resources through th e path of related tags. The steps needed from one resource to another are relatively few by following tags X  connections. This property can also be applied in resource recommendation. The path length between tags provides supplementary information to op timize the result of recommender system. We can calculate the path length between resources X  tags and determine relevant resources to recommend. connection by our definition trul y has semantic relationship. Those highly clustered nodes of tags have dense connections because they are related to each other. As a scale-free network, a few tags take the most part of whole tag space; while most tags have relatively small amount. This feature can give inspiration for designing tag-base d systems. For example, because users have some slim set of frequently used tags, the system should provide convenient interface so that these tags can be easily added. The efficiency improves on these tagging behaviors will give significant promotion to the whole system. The connections between tags are formed by users X  collaboration tagging behavior, where pairs of tags linked together are used by investigate these links and check whether there are semantic relationships between connected tags. We can view the semantic rela tionship between tags as the semantic relatedness between words, which has been studied for a long history. Morris [37] stated 5 basic classes of semantic relationships between words: 1. Reiteration with identity of reference. 2. Reiteration without identity of reference. 3. Reiteration by means of super ordinate. 4. Systematic semantic relation (systematically classifiable). 5. Non systematic semantic relation (not systematically classifiable). We find that all five classes of relationships could be found in the links of tags in our tag graph. But we still try to verify the existence of such semantic relatedness. We pick the semantic similarity as our target properties and measure the semantic distance between tags. Semantic similarity has some differences from semantic relatedness because semantic relatedness includes concepts as antonymy and meronymy. However, much of the literature uses these terms interc hangeably. In essence, semantic similarity and semantic relatedness all mean, "How much does term A have to do with term B?" There have been many proposals estimating semantic similarity by computing distance between the words, such as Resnik [38] and Maguitman [39]. The result distance is usually a number, betw een 0 and 1, where 1 signifies extremely high similarity/relatedness, and 0 signifies little-to-none. Here we use the system of Open Roget 1 , which is based on Roget X  X  Thesaurus [40], to evalua te the distance between words. Roget X  X  Thesaurus, containing around 250,000 words, is based on a well-constructed concept classification. The distance of two terms in Roget X  X  Thesaurus equals to the number of edges in the shortest path: The words from th e same semicolon group have the shortest distance of 0; and the l ongest distance is 16, as shown in Table 4. The performance of Roge t Thesaurus based approach is better than WordNet-based similarity measures according to author X  X  evaluation in [40]. Distance Relationship Example 0 same semicolon group j ourney X  X  end  X  terminus 4 same part of speech popular misconception  X  6 same head individual  X  lonely 8 same head group finance  X  apply for a loan 10 same sub-section life expectancy  X  herbalize 12 same section love  X  inspired 14 same class book  X  blind eye 16 in the Thesaurus nag  X  lightning We perform a measurement of sim ilarity distances on our dataset of connected tags and find the distance is 9.17 by average, which is small compared to the dist ance between randomly picked tag pairs, as shown in Table 5. As a result, the semantic similarity of connected tags is stronger than random picked tag pairs, which indicates the semantic relations hip X  X  existence within social network of tags. * Many words of tags (e.g. "diy", "xbox", and "iphone") are not contained in Roget X  X  Thesaurus and are excluded from the measurement. (as shown in Table 6) and find the same result that the word relatedness between linked tags is stronger than random pairs. http://rogets.site.uottawa.ca/ Measurement Connected Tags Random pairs of tags PMI-Gwikipedia 0.484 0.204 NSS-Gwikipedia 0.217 0.116 WordnetVector 0.271 0.04 *PMI (Pointwise mutual information [5]) quantifies the discrepancy between the probability of their coincidence given their joint distribution versus the probability of their coincidence given only their individual distributions and assuming independence. NSS (Normalized S earch Similarity) is proposed by Cilibrasi [6] and adapted from Normalized Google Distance. SA (Spreading Activation) is based on the Spreading Activation formula [44]. All meas ures that end with "-G" use the Google search engine, and "-Gwikipedia" searches only *.wikipedia.org. WordNet engine used here is from http://marimba.d.umn.edu. The result indicates that the links defined by us between tags contain the semantic information. If there is a link between two tags in tag network, the seman tic relatedness is closer for two words within the context of resource space. The links of tags can give so me insight about the semantic relatedness between words in hum an X  X  cognition of resources, which is useful for both resear chers and system designers. For example, the Open Directory project uses human effect to maintain the list of Web resources and their categories. With the map of tag graph, we can automa tically achieve the same function with bookmarks with associated tags. Besides, the semantic informati on within tag connection can be utilized in search engines, recommendation systems, etc. For example, the distance of tags with in the socio-gram can also help measure the word distance. It X  X  slow for new words (such as a product name, like "iphone") to be included in dictionary. However, they can be immediatel y used by users in tagging. And it X  X  easy to calculate the distance between them and other words in tag network. individual level. Annotation on re sources created by users while browsing and bookmarking can reflect the resource content and users X  subjective cognition of these resources. Although each single tagging activity seems arbitrary, we examine the tagging history of user and try to find some consistent patterns. analyze and to find regularities. So we adopt the visualization method to solve the problem, displaying the long textual sequences through simple color c oding schemes. Specifically, in this section we conduct following analyses: 1. We use visualization method of Chromogram to find some properties of users X  tagging behavior and interests. 2. We propose a visualization me thod called TagScatter to reveal the relationships among the count of tags, frequency of tagging, and tag X  X  creation time of a user. 3. We study the individual bookmark with its tags with method of Cloudalicious. 4. We check whether the users X  link has some connection with the users X  interest similarity, by comparing their tags. Although some of our jobs are at the exploratory stage and we do the analysis mainly by observing, we believe our work will give some insights into users X  tagging behavior and provide inspiration for future system design. We use Chromogram to investigat e the tagging behavior of a user as time goes by. Chromogram is a method proposed by Wattenberg [41], who used it to examine the editing activity on Wikipedia. The method is designed th at the first three letters of a string determine the color of its representation. The first letter determines the hue; the second le tter determines the saturation and the third the brightness. For example, tags are translated to corresponding colors as shown in Figure 6. Although at first this may look like an arbitrary way to encode text, in practice, the method is effective at revealing structural features. And the encoding meets the criteria of spreading colors over a large section of color space and of remaining consistent from one sequence to the next. The dataset used here contains a random sample of 1583 users with all bookmarks ever posted by them. Each user on Del.icio.us has a personal page (http://del.icio.us/username), on which all the bookmarks the user has ever creat ed are displayed in reverse-ever given to bookmarks. We collect those public bookmarks. Although a user can set specific bookmarks as private, bookmarks posted in Del.icio.us are publicly viewable by default. So for each user, our dataset contains his/ her complete bookmarking history. The number of bookmarks per person ranges from 18 to 16,642. The average number is 1,782. We anonymize usernames in all visualization diagrams and discussions. We develop an application that can display three kinds of view of Chromogram. In compact view, the colors are arranged compactly in chronological order, to display the whole tag sequence on a timeline, which is convenient to observe temporal evolution of tags. In highlight view, a certain ta g X  X  color is highlighted to show its regularity. After applying these methods on the tag sequences, we could find some patterns of tag usage: Firstly, the theme-based bookmarking is usual for users. Users X  activities focus on certain topics (with same tag/color) in a period of time. Figure 7 is an example in compact view, showing this user is likely to concentrate on some topics (continuous blocks with same color) in a certain pe riod (one day or several days). The similar result can also be seen in timeline view, as shown in Figure 8, where the bookmarks within a short period have many common tags. However, the theme-based pattern in tagging is not as obvious as that of Wikipedia users X  editing activities [41]. Here, users X  interests show great diversity in tagging. Secondly, some topics continually attract the user, just like the result shown in highlight view as in Figure 9, while some topics are paid much attention to by the user only within a period of time, as shown in Figure 10. We investigate the distribution of tags of a certain user with histogram and find they have the f eature of long tail, as shown in Figure 11. The x-axis indicates the count of bookmarks of tag. The y-axis shows the count of ta gs. We can see that those tags with few quantities of bookmarks have large amount and form the "long tail". Meanwhile, those popular tags associated with many bookmarks have limited amount. The re sult here is consistent to scale-free feature of tag network we X  X e found before. We propose a kind of visualization called TagScatter to investigate the relationships among the tags X  count, bookmarking interval and creation time. The visualization represents three diameter of circle is determin ed by the count of bookmarks of corresponding tag. The y-axis indi cates the average time interval of bookmarking with tag. And x-ax is shows the first creation time of each tag. We use TagScatter to go through the same dataset as in Chromogram and try to get some insight from observing. Figure 12 is a typical TagScatter of user and we find that: 1. Those tags with short average usage interval have usually more counts, which is understandable. 2. Some tags have short averag e usage interval but small amount of counts. It reveals that these ta gs and their topics are paid close attention to by users within a short period. 3. Usually, those tags with ear ly creation time will have more counts, which means that the users X  continuing attention on these topics. However, there are still many tags that come up early with little amount of usage. 4. Those tags with late creation time always have small counts of usage. However, exceptions exist. There are some reasons for these exceptions: Users may have new interest or are assigned with new tasks from work or study; Or these tags are describing those new popular resources or pr oducts on the Internet, such as "iPhone". 5. Tags gather at the area of "short time interval and early creation time". Little tags are positioned at the area of "long time interval and late creation time". We use a kind of line graph, called Cloudalicious [42], to display tags X  proportions on a certain URL, as well as their evolution over time. As shown in Figure 13, each line in the graph demonstrates the evolution of a concrete tag a ssociated with this bookmark. The x-axis shows the date, and the y-ax is shows the relative weight of tags. This visualization met hod helps us see how tags on a bookmark evolve as time goes on. We investigate those bookmarks which have been in De l.icio.us for a long time. Here we find a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags. For example, Figure 13 is the Cloudalicious diagram for Google.com. We could see that those most frequently used tags are created immediately when the bookmark is submitted. Those less used those can be firstly thought of and can best describe the bookmark. The weights of tags are relatively stable. This "stable" feature shown in Cloudalicious indicates that tagging eventually settles to a group of tags that describe the resource well and new users mostly reinforce already present tags in the same frequency as in the stable distribution. The phenomenon of stability is in accordance with the scale-free propert y of tags network. Besides, stability in the relative proportions of tags can also prove the semantic accuracy of tags X  usage. The social network of users might provide a context for tagging behavior. So in this part we will check whether the social network of users in Del.icio.us has impact on their interests and choices of tagging. When we wanted to extract and study the user interests, we find that users X  resources coupled with their content are relatively hard to be analyzed. However, with the tag sequence, we could find some indication about the user X  X  background and what this user may like. Users may have similar interests if their annotations share many semantica lly related tags. So we compare the tags of linked users on Del. icio.us with those of randomly picked users to show whether the possibility of sharing common topics is higher with user connection. Del.icio.us uses a subscription network to connect users and allows users to keep track of others X  bookmarks. In Del.icio.us, users form links for many reasons. The nodes connected by a link can be real-world acquaintan ces or online acquaintances. We guess the social networks will influence the creation of social annotation. This is a typical scen ario in Del.icio.us: User A and user B are mutual connected. They might be friends in reality, or they had recognized each other on the Web. One day, A found a fantastic photograph website, so he bookmarked it in Del.icio.us, with tags like "photograph". B was in the network of A, so he might follow A X  X  bookmarks. B also thought that photograph site was attractive and bookmarked it too. This kind of activity is common in Del.icio.us networks. The social network encourages the coincidence between people X  X  interests. From crawled users in analysis of Chromogram, we gathered user social network to form the datase t of users X  social networks, via recursively traversing each user X  X  network (others to whom the user is subscribed) until no more users. We collect data of 12,740 users, and anonymize any identifying data in analysis. We first investigated the common interests between connected users by observing visualized user data. We compared the highlight views of Chromogram of different people who were mutual connected within Del.icio.us social network. We found the possibility of having common intere sts was high for these pairs. Below are the highlight views of a tag ("architecture") of three mutual connected users on Del.ic io.us (Figure 14a, 14b, 14c). We found they share many bookm arks with common tags. The data analysis confirms the observed results. We compared the proportion of bookmarks with common tags in pairs of linked users with those of random pairs of users. For a pair of users, we got the list of their common ta gs, calculated the amount of bookmarks with these ta gs, and examined the proportion of these bookmarks in all their bookmarks. Th e result is shown in table 7, showing that users within a s ubscription network share more common interests than random users in Del.icio.us. As a result, we find those peopl e connected within Del.icio.us network are more possible to share common interests. There are many reasons that may cause this phenomenon: 1. People within a social network may impact each other. Users can view what others are concer ning. So some bookmarks of them might be introduced from others. 2. Those people within a social network in Del.icio.us have common interests. So instinctively they will have common tags. There are two different situations. First, maybe these people are already in a social network in real life (such as in the same department in college) or in othe r online networks (such as within a mailing list). Connection is likely to be set up between people with similar background or interest. Second, they know each other through Del.icio.us. Users can use Del.icio.us to find those people with similar interest and add them to their network. In this paper, we analyzed tags and users X  tagging behavior within a social network. The analyses ha ve two levels. In network level, analyzed its network properties. The connections between tags were formed by the common re sources of them. We found the network of tag had the feature of small world and scale-free network. Meanwhile, our result showed that linked tags had relatively strong semantic relatedne ss. In the individual level, we observed the users X  tagging beha viors and tag X  X  evolution by visualization. We showed some patterns of users X  tagging. Besides, we found that users within a subscription network shared more common interests than random pairs of users in Del.icio.us. The results from both levels were consistent with each other. For example, the stability of tags on a bookmark is consistent to the network feature of scale-free. Much work still remains. Our m easurement only considered the semantic similarity, which was a special case of semantic relatedness [43]: for example, cars and gasoline would seem to be certainly more similar. Besi des, the patterns we found from visualization need to be confirme d by further experience or user survey. [1] Tso-Sutter, K.H.L., L.B. Mari nho, and L. Schmidt-Thieme, [2] Arrington, M.
