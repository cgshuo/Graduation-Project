 1. Introduction
In a previous study ( Bilal &amp; Bachir, 2006 ), we assessed the cross-cultural usability of the ICDL interface design (e.g., icons, buttons, search and browse features) to Arabic-speaking children based on  X  X  X epresenta-tions and meaning X  X  rather than on internationalization and localization. In addition, we examined the utility of the ICDL navigation controls and the extent they supported the children X  X  navigation. In the present study, we report the results of children X  X  information seeking behavior, success, and affective experience in using the
ICDL. Very few studies have examined and compared information seeking of various cultural groups in using the on the design and use of digital libraries ( Komlodi, Caidi, &amp; Wheeler, 2004 ). At the start of 2000, a rapid explosion of digital libraries (DLs) took place worldwide. While abundant research on the evaluation and use of DLs is available ( Saracevic, 2005 ), little work has focused on children X  X  interaction with these tools.
In his recent study, Saracevic (2005) , cited eighty studies on the evaluation of DLs, of these one was about children. The advent of the ICDL in 2002 provided a new venue of research in DLs that is manifested in the work of Druin (2002, 2005), Hutchinson, Bederson, and Druin (2005), Hutchinson et al. (2004) and Reuter and Druin (2004) . Although this body of research provided good understanding of how children search, browse, and select digital books, they only involved children in the United States who use a uniform language (i.e., English). As an international, multicultural, and multilingual digital library, the ICDL is designed for access by children worldwide including those who reside in Arabic-speaking countries (i.e., Egypt). To date, we lack knowledge of whether children X  X  information seeking in DLs is generalizeable across other user groups, especially culturally diverse children. To better understand how these children (i.e., Arabic-speaking) use the ICDL, we need to obtain a holistic view of their information seeking behavior; that is, their searching and browsing patterns, success, and affective experience. As Borgman (2000) notes, digital libraries are con-structed, collected, and organized, by (and for) a community of users, and their functional capabilities should support the information needs and uses of that community. Thus, we argue that the more the ICDL supports the information seeking, needs, and success of Arabic-speaking children, the more usable it is for them. 2. The ICDL interfaces
The ICDL has four interfaces Simple, Advanced, Location, and Keyword. A detailed description of each in Fig. 1 and the interface for the Arabic book is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The interfaces were used the most by
Arabic-speaking children. 3. Related literature
Related literature reviewed in this study pertains to children X  X  information seeking on the Web and chil-dren X  X  interaction with digital libraries. 3.1. Children X  X  information seeking on the Web
A growing body of research has developed concerning children X  X  use of the Web. In a recent study, Enochs-son (2005) explored the different skills necessary for seeking information on the Web by students from pre-school to ninth grade who attended a Swedish compulsory school. Students identified six skills for successful information seeking. Younger students considered language and knowledge of technology as the two funda-mental skills whereas older students regarded these skills in addition to knowledge of how to formulate search strategies, how the search engines work, setting goals (e.g., knowing exactly what to look for), and being crit-ical of the information found. Although this study did not observe how students interacted with the Web, it provided insights into the students X  preconceptions of what makes a user successful in finding information in this medium.
 In a study of Yahooligans!, a search engine and directory that is specifically designed for children ages 7 X 12,
Bilal investigated the cognitive, affective, and physical behaviors of seventh-grade science children in finding information on three tasks. One task was fact-based ( Bilal, 2000 ), one was research-based ( Bilal, 2001 ), and one was fully self-generated (2002).

Children X  X  interaction with Yahooligans! on the three tasks was captured online using the Lotus ScreenCam software package to collect empirical data about their Web moves, searching, browsing, and navigation pat-terns. Children X  X  demographic and prior experience in using the Internet and Yahooligans!, domain knowl-edge, topic knowledge, and reading ability were gathered through a structured questionnaire that was distributed to the children prior to using Yahooligans! Children X  X  affective states were elicited through individ-ual exit interviews.

Findings revealed that 50% succeeded on the fact-based task, 69% partially succeeded on the research-based task, and 73% succeeded on the fully self-generated task. Failure to examine the retrieved results and read the content of the Web pages retrieved, and a lack of adequate research skills surfaced as problems. In general, children had more difficulty with the research-based task than with the fact-based one, mainly due to seeking a target answer rather than developing understanding of the information found. These findings were congru-ent with the results of a study by Wallace and Kupperman (1997) who observed that despite the prior training they provided to middle school students in using search engines, the students X  success was minimal. On the fully self-generated task, children were asked to choose a topic of interest to pursue in Yahooligans!
Although they were more successful on this task compared to the other two tasks, children experienced dif-initial topics were broad in nature and, therefore, necessitated mediation. During mediation (led by Bilal and the school librarian), 67% of the children were able to formulate a focus while 33% were undecided on one.
Children preferred this task to the other two tasks (fact-and research-based) due to satisfaction with search interest in finding the information sought and resulted in high satisfaction in using Yahooligans!
Children X  X  cognitive behavior reflected adequate understanding of term relationships, concept selection, and search formulation. The breakdowns they experienced with keyword searching was attributed to the inad-equate design of Yahooligans!-scanty indexing, misleading titles of hyperlinks, and brief summaries of hyper-links. These problems, combined with the children X  X  inadequate knowledge of how to use the engine and navigate its environment effectively and efficiently, contributed to the difficulties children experienced. These studies had implications for system design improvements and for developing effective Web training programs.
In an earlier study, Schacter, Chung, and Dorr (1998) examined the searching behavior of fifth-and sixth-graders in using the Web for one fact-based and one research-based task. They found that children were more successful on the research-based task than on the fact-based task and browsed more than they searched by keyword on both tasks. Children experienced difficulty with keyword searching due to use of natural language, inappropriate query formulation, and spelling errors. Similar findings were revealed in a study by Large and
Beheshti (2000) as they interviewed middle school students after they used Infoseek and Alta Vista to find information on assigned tasks. Despite the fact that children were trained in using the engines, especially in terms of query formulation and using Boolean logic, they did not find sufficient relevant information and were overwhelmed with information overload. Interestingly, children liked the speed of the Web and the unique information it contains, but found it harder to use than print sources.

In an earlier study, Wallace and Kupperman (1997) observed a group of sixth-graders in using the Web to find information for a class-related project. Children were not successful in locating the desired information.
They had problems using Boolean logic, queried the engines in natural language, frequently repeated searches that failed, and sought specific answers to research-based information problems. The authors concluded that children X  X  lack of adequate research skills contributed to failure in solving research-based tasks, a finding that was confirmed by Bilal (2001) .

The reviewed work on children X  X  information seeking on the Web employed varied methodologies, observed children X  X  interaction with different engines and Web sites, and included children of various grade levels and gender. Despite these differences, this work revealed similarities and differences in information seek-ing among the children. Children browsed more than searched by keyword, had difficulty formulating ade-quate search strategies, queried search engines in natural language, committed spelling errors, and possessed na X   X  ve Web navigation skills. The differences in information seeking among the children concerned use of Boolean logic, success in finding information (low vs. high), and perceptions of using the Web (positive vs. negative).

Digital libraries are becoming commonplace in many children X  X  lives and their rapid explosion worldwide has turned researchers to the study of children X  X  use of these new technological tools. Hutchinson et al. (2005) conducted two studies of children X  X  searching and browsing in two new interfaces they developed for the ICDL category browser. One is simultaneous and another is sequential. A group of first, third, and fifth grade chil-dren participated in the study. The simultaneous interface used a single-level category structure with 44 leaf-level categories and required less navigation to select multiple categories. The sequential interface employed a two-level category and presented the 44 leaves into nine facets, each with 2 X 12 leaves. Each child used both interfaces for searching and browsing to find information on six assigned tasks. Findings showed that children created more Boolean searches in the simultaneous interface than the sequential interface. Significant differ-ences in searching were found by grade level. Older children performed the tasks faster than younger ones, needed less hints, and used the navigation tools on their own more than younger ones did. Overall, this study revealed that a flat category structure presented simultaneously is more supportive of children X  X  searching and browsing than a sequential hierarchical category structure, especially for Boolean searching. The study con-cluded with design guidelines to support children X  X  browsing and searching in the ICDL.

In another study, Reuter and Druin (2004) investigated the searching and book selection behaviors of ninety-six first-through fifth-grade students from the suburbs of Maryland in using the ICDL. Children uti-lized the Basic and Enhanced interfaces of the ICDL (now named Simple and Advanced, respectively) and logging software captured their searching, browsing, and other online activities. The findings revealed that first-and fifth-graders performed the most queries. The World area (part of the Location interface) was the most popular with younger children as they enjoyed spinning the globe repeatedly and clicking on the conti-nents. The most popular search categories were Genre, Subject, and Color; and preference for these varied between boys and girls. Children X  X  searching and book selection varied by age and gender. Younger children preferred simple and more interactive interfaces; whereas, older children favored more sophisticated inter-faces. Children in grades one through five were able to navigate the category structure (to browse) but were unable to use Boolean logic. This study found that the design of the ICDL was more supportive of older than younger children, and that simpler interfaces should be developed to support younger children more effectively.

While the ICDL is an international, multicultural, and multilingual digital library and is in the public domain, ARTEMIS is fee-based digital library that is designed for science middle school students, grades 6 X 12. Abbas, Norris, and Soloway (2002) examined a group of six graders X  interaction with ARTEMIS using transaction log data of 754 user groups (2 X 3 students per group) from 32 schools located in the United States.
Findings showed that children were more exploratory than directed in their searching and their vocabulary did not match that employed in ARTEMIS. In addition, both groups of younger and older children experienced problems using ARTEMIS especially in terms of mismatched vocabulary with the one employed in the system.
The reviewed literature begins to offer understanding of children X  X  interaction with digital libraries. How-ever, additional research is needed to gain better understanding of children X  X  use of these technology tools. To date, we have no understanding of whether the results of these studies are generalizeable across various cultural groups of digital library users including Arabic-speaking children. 4. Research questions
In order to obtain a holistic view of Arabic-speaking children X  X  interaction with the ICDL, this study addressed the following questions: 1. What information seeking behavior do Arabic-speaking children exhibit in interacting with the ICDL? 2. How successful are Arabic-speaking children in finding Arabic books on the four tasks and how much time do they spend on completing each task in the ICDL? 3. What perceptions and affective states do Arabic-speaking children possess about using the ICDL? 5. Method
This study employed the same method of data collection used in part one, quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative method provided empirical data about children X  X  navigation behavior in finding books. Data were captured via HyperCam, a video logging software that record and replay captured online activities (e.g., browsing, searching, and navigating). The qualitative method elicited children X  X  perceptions of and affec-tive experience in using the ICDL. This was achieved through group interviews that took place upon the com-pletion of data collection. In addition, individual interviews were conducted prior to children X  X  use of the
ICDL to generate a profile of demographic information, prior experiences, and reading habits and prefer-ences. The data gathered from these interviews are reported in part I of this study. 5.1. Participants This study used a convenient sample since random sampling is not possible due to voluntary participation.
Children were recruited by the children X  X  librarian at Bibliotheca Alexandrina (Bib. Alex.) where the study took place. The librarian contacted the parents of 15 children via telephone and informed them about the pur-pose of the study. The librarian obtained the parents X  initial permission for their children X  X  participation.
Upon the researchers X  request, one group of five parents and their children came to the library on December 24, 2004, and another group participated on December 25, 2004. After reading the consent forms and agreeing to participate, the resulting sample consisted of four male and six female children, ages 6 X 10. One child was six-years old, three were seven-years old, two were eight, two were nine, one child was nine and a half and another one was ten years old. The sample is justifiable according to the quantitative and qualitative nature of this research which generates much data to be coded and analyzed.
 5.2. Setting
The study took place in Bib. Alex. Children X  X  Library. The empirical data were gathered at Bib. Alex. Infor-mation and Computer Technology Laboratory (ICTL) since the computers in the Library did not meet the hardware requirements of HyperCam software. Group interviews were also held at the ICTL. 5.3. Procedures
The design of the study was planned in October 2004. The director, head librarian, and the technology team at Bib. Alex. were contacted via email and their consent to use Bib. Alex. for data collection was obtained.
Parental and child consent forms in both English and Arabic languages were developed to meet the Institu-tional Review Board (IRB) requirements for conducting this study. The Arabic language was used throughout procedures list, and ICDL tasks) were created to guide the researchers in data collection.
 Data were gathered on December 24 and 25, 2004. On December 23, 2004, the researchers met with Bib. engineer and discussed the details of the study including hardware needs. The technology specialist and com-puter engineer tested HyperCam and identified an appropriate computer laboratory for installing the software and collecting the empirical data. HyperCam software was installed on five computers located in Bib. Alex. ICTL.

On December 24, a group of five children used the ICDL. Each child was interviewed individually and later escorted to the ICTL to use the ICDL. Meanwhile, one of the technology specialist ensured that HyperCam was working properly on each of the designated computers and that the ICDL website ( http://www.icdl-books.org ) was ready for use. The same method was repeated with the second group of children who used the ICDL on December 25.

Children were briefly introduced to how to use the ICDL and were given four written tasks in the Arabic language to perform. These were read and explained to them by the researchers to ensure understanding (see
Appendix 1 for the English version of the tasks). Upon completion of the tasks, children took a short break and were later interviewed in the ICTL as a group to elicit their perceptions of and affective experience with the ICDL. The interviews were audio-recorded and children X  X  responses were transcribed on paper by one of the researchers to ensure no data loss. 5.4. ICDL sessions
Two ICDL sessions were held in the ICTL, one on December 24 and another on December 25. Each session included a brief demonstration of how to use the ICDL various search and browse features and was followed with explanation of the tasks to perform in the ICDL. HyperCam screen-captured children X  X  interaction with the ICDL on the four tasks (searching, browsing, navigating, selecting, and reading Arabic books). Upon completion, each captured ICDL session (one per child) was saved on the computer used and later transferred electronically to a designated file server in Bib. Alex. All transferred ICDL sessions were later burned onto
CDs by the technology specialist and given to the researchers. Each CD was tested to ensure that the captured data replayed successfully from initiation to completion and that no data were lost. 5.5. ICDL tasks
Conducting a usability study in an international user interface requires involvement of real users who will perform real tasks in the interface being tested ( Neilsen, 1996 ). Therefore, we developed four tasks for the children to perform: 1. How many books does the ICDL have in the Arabic languag e; 2. Find a book in the Arabic language named Dima and open the first page of the book ;3. Find a book about animals in the Arabic language and write the name of the book on your sheet ; and 4. Find any book in Arabic and read as many pages as you can ( Appendix 1 ). To ensure confidentially, each child was assigned a number (from 1 to 10) that was used throughout data collection.
The selected tasks varied in terms of nature (closed vs. open-ended), type (simple vs. complex) and admin-istration (assigned vs. semi-assigned vs. fully self-generated). This task variety was based on the task taxonomy developed by Bilal (2002) and was driven by prior research which showed that a user information seeking and success can be influenced by the way tasks are structured ( Bilal, 2000, 2001, 2002; Bystrom &amp; Jarvelin, 1995;
Gross, 1997; Hirsh, 1997; Marchionini, 1995; Vakkari, 1999 ). Accordingly, the four tasks children performed in the ICDL varied in structure. Tasks one and two were fully assigned, closed and simple; task three was semi-assigned, closed and simple, and task four was fully self-generated and open-ended. We believe that task variety would trigger Arabic-speaking children X  X  interest in performing them. 5.6. Group interviews
Children were interviewed in groups of five at the conclusion of data collection. One group was interviewed on Friday, December 24 and another on Saturday, December 25 using a group questionnaire instrument the researchers developed. Interviews were conducted in the Arabic language (see Appendix 2 for the English ver-sion of this instrument). 6. Data analysis
Children X  X  information seeking behavior (searching and browsing) on each task was coded based on the search and browse features supported in the ICDL; that is, keyword searching, browsing using the Simple interface option, browsing using the Advanced interface option, browsing using the Location interface option; and using additional search/browse features such as color, theme, and the like. Children X  X  information seeking activities on each task was coded using Excel software. For example, an Excel sheet for a child X  X  coded ICDL activities on task one included: the child X  X  assigned number, number of clicks on a specific interface (e.g., Sim-ple), starting time, ending time, total time, answer to the task, and other observational notes (e.g., skipping tasks, idle time, and other problems). 6.1. Success measure
Arabic-speaking children X  X  success on each of the four tasks was judged as follows. On task 1, Find the num-ber of Arabic books in the ICDL and write down the number on the task sheet , success was judged based on tran-scribing the number 26 (the total number of Arabic books in the ICDL at the time of the study) on the task sheet. On task two, Find a book titled Dima and open the first page of the book , success was assessed based on a child X  X  clicking on the book titled Dima and opening the first page. On task three, Find a book about animals chose from the ICDL with the title of the book the child wrote on the task sheet. Since task four ( Find an Arabic book that you like and read as many pages as you can ) was open-ended and did not require transcribing a book title on the task sheet, we replayed each child X  X  captured ICDL session on this task and judged success based on whether the child selected a book on a topic of interest and read it. There was no limit as to the number of pages the children were required to read and they were not timed to complete this task. 6.2. Group interviews
Group interviews that captured children X  X  perceptions of the ICDL and affective experience were analyzed qualitatively based on extracting the recurring responses to each of the questions asked, and quantitatively by generating descriptive statistics. 6.3. Time
The time a child took to complete each task was totaled and the average time taken by all children on each task was calculated. Similarly, the average time taken by all children on all four tasks (mean value) was gene-rated based on descriptive statistics.
 7. Results
The results of this study are reported within the context of the four research questions posed. 7.1. What information seeking behavior do Arabic-speaking children exhibit in interacting with the ICDL?
Information seeking behavior can be manifested through searching and browsing for information. Arabic-children X  X  information seeking behavior was examined in terms of searching and browsing to find Arabic books on the four tasks in the ICDL. Searching is performed through the Keyword option and browsing is achieved through the Simple, Advanced, or Location options. The Simple interface allows finding books by language whereas the Advanced interface provides browsing by subject categories. The Location option sup-ports visual browsing by pointing the mouse to the globe and clicking on a geographic area of interest. Chil-dren used the Simple option and clicked on  X  X  X rabic X  X  from the language pull-down menu 26 times ( Table 1 ).
Only one younger child clicked on the Location option once, pointed to the globe, did not make any selection, and returned to the Simple option to find books. No child utilized the Advanced or Keyword option. While older children recognized the purpose of the Keyword option (see part one of this study), they did not use it since it support searching by Arabic keywords.

In addition to these search and browse options, the ICDL employs iconic visual searching by categories such as animal characters, picture books, colors, themes, and book size. Only one younger child clicked on
Picture Books but moved quickly to the Simple option. While children X  X  avoidance of keyword searching was due to lack of system support for Arabic keywords, the fact that they did not browse by subject categories may be due to the language of the interface (i.e., English) which was a barrier to understanding the represen-tations of these categories. Another reason may be that these categories were not represented by icons to understand their meanings. 7.2. How successful are Arabic-speaking children in finding Arabic books on the four tasks, and how much time do they spend on completing each task in the ICDL?
An important element of assessing the utility of the ICDL to Arabic-children is their success in finding the information sought. Children X  X  success on the four tasks was judged based on the success measure described earlier.

As seen in Table 2 , eight out of ten children (80%) gave the correct answer to task one ( How many books does the ICDL have in the Arabic language ?). One child did not transcribe the answer on the task sheet and another gave an incorrect answer (37 instead of 26). Although the number of Arabic books is automatically displayed when clicking on  X  X  X rabic X  X  from the pull-down menu in the Simple option not all children noticed it.
Based on the researchers X  observational notes, 40% who gave a correct answer counted the number of books based on the Arabic book thumbnails displayed on each screen, and another 40% provided the number of books based on the total number shown in the Simple option.

Task two ( Find a book titled Dima and open the first page of the book ) was completed successfully by 80% of the children. The children who did not succeed did not click on or bring up the screen for the book Dima and moved directly from task one to task three. This behavior may be attributed to either lack of focus or misun-derstanding of how to complete the task.

Contrary to tasks one and two, 90% of the children completed task three successfully ( Find an Arabic book about animals and write down the title of the book on the task sheet ). Five children (50%) opted for the book
Black Ear Blond Ear , two (20%) selected Bakkar at the Zoo , one child (10%) chose Bakkar Left School and another child (10%) selected Dok Dok Laughs ( Table 3 ).

Children X  X  high success and reading engagement was observed on task four ( Find one book in Arabic that you like and read as many pages as you can ). Eight children (80%) read one book each in its entirety and two children (20%) read two books each. Evidently, these two children exceeded the expectations of the task, indi-cating that they are avid and fast readers.
 Children selected these books on task four: Bakkar at the Zoo , Bakkar and the Little Bird , Bakkar at the
Library , Bakkar Loves School, Bakkar Visits the Dentist ,and Dima ( Table 3 ). It is obvious that the Bakkar series is very popular among Arabic-speaking children. In fact, preference for this series was advocated by the children when asked about their reading preferences and habits during the individual interviews that were conducted prior to using the ICDL ( Table 4 ). This finding validates children X  X  articulation of their preferences and provides further reliability of the collected data during the interviews.

During the group interviews, children were asked about their success in completing the four tasks. All chil-dren (100%) were positive that they completed the tasks successfully. However, their perceived success did not match their actual outcome on the tasks. Children X  X  positive perception of success is encouraging because it delineates self-confidence. However, the two children whose perception of success did not match their actual outcome may need additional guidance in using the ICDL. 7.2.1. Time to complete tasks
The time children took to complete each task varied. All children (100%) performed task one, and the time taken to complete it ranged from two minutes and thirty-three seconds to nine minutes, (2 m:33 s to 9 m) (m = minutes, s = seconds), averaging four minutes and fifty-seven seconds (mean = 4 m:57 s).
The youngest child who was six-years old took the longest time to complete this task (9 m), followed by the child who was seven-years old who took seven minutes and twenty nine seconds (7 m:29 s). Only eight children (80%) performed task two and the time they took ranged from forty-three seconds to two minutes and thirty-nine seconds (43 s to 2 m:39 s) averaging one minute and thirty-four seconds (mean = 1 m:34 s).
Two children (20%) did not perform this task, one was six-years old (the youngest) and another was nine-years old.

Most children (90%) performed task three and took from one minute fifty-one seconds to eight minutes and fifty-five seconds to complete (1 m:51 s to 8 m:55 s), averaging four minutes and six seconds (mean = 4 m:06 s). The child who was nine-years old skipped this task.

Unlike tasks two and three, all children (100%) performed task four successfully. They took from two min-utes and two seconds to fourteen minutes and fifty five seconds (2 m:02 s to 14 m:55 s), averaging nine minutes and fifteen seconds (mean = 9 m:15 s) to complete. The fact that this task took the longest time is not surpris-ing, since it was open-ended and required selecting a book on a topic of interest and reading as many pages as possible. Children read one book each in its entirety for this task. It is noteworthy that children were not lim-ited to a specific time to complete any of the tasks. 7.3. What perceptions and affective states do Arabic-speaking children possess about the ICDL?
We elicited Arabic-speaking children X  X  perceptions of and affective experience in using the ICDL. The aim of this data collection was to obtain information for constructing a holistic and rich picture of the children X  X  perceptions and affective experience ( Kuhlthau, 2004; Nahl, 2004 ) and to draw the researchers into the world of the participants. Affect has recently emerged as a new paradigm that complements the cognitive paradigm in information seeking ( Bilal, 2005 ). Using group interviews for exploring children X  X  perceptions and affective experience can be effective for identifying areas of consensus and differences among them ( Shenton &amp; Dixon, tion, it included suggestions for improving its design. 7.3.1. ICDL experience, likes, and dislikes
There was a consensus among the children regarding their positive experience in using the ICDL, as one child said:  X  X  X t was beautiful and I saw beautiful things X  X ; and another child corroborated:  X  X  X t was a new expe-rience. It gives great stories X  X . All children said they liked the ICDL for being educational, having great books in Arabic, and for gaining a new experience in reading books online. Five children (50%) noted:  X  X  X t was beau-tiful, we benefited by reading books and seeing beautiful things ... it was easy, we read, got used to it ... The
ICDL has great stories X  X . Indeed, using the ICDL was a new experience for 90% of the children and since they were habitual readers, they appreciated being able to read Arabic books online.

Despite children X  X  positive affects about the ICDL, they disliked the fact that the ICDL Arabic collection was also available at Bib. Alex. children X  X  library. Most children (80%) had already read books from this collection at the library, and therefore, they expected to find new books to read in the ICDL. Apparently, children were not aware that these books reflect the titles held at the children X  X  library.

In addition, children commented on the small size of the Arabic collection (26 books) and requested a larger collection similar to that in the English language. Compared to many collections, the ICDL Arabic collection is indeed small. Staff at Bib. Alex. should digitize additional books to contribute to the ICDL so that they support and reinforce children X  X  reading habits and preferences.

Most children (90%) believed that the ICDL was easy to use and one child (10%) noted that it was not  X  X  X rightening X  X . Apparently, the child had a negative preconception about the ICDL before interacting with it, but after using it he/she was positive about using it. 7.3.2. Feelings about using the ICDL
Children experienced different feelings before and after using the ICDL. Two children (20%) felt that it would be difficult to use, but after using it they found it to be easy. One child (10%) was uncertain as to his/her ability to use the ICDL, but afterwards the child was confident, as he/she said:  X  X  X  felt scared because experience was pleasant X  X .

Other children (30%) were optimistic, happy, and confident before using it, as one child said:  X  X  X  had feelings that I would have a beautiful experience and I was happy. After using the ICDL, I felt the same because the library was easy and neat X  X . Another child stated:  X  X  X  was astonished because I was able to use [the ICDL] and was happy because I had a new experience X  X . Two children (20%) liked the fact that they used the computer to read books, which was a new experience for them. The rest of the children (20%) did not comment on their feelings before or after using the ICDL, except that they liked it. Overall, children enjoyed interacting with the
ICDL and asked whether they could access it from home and school. Many of them were looking forward to using it again. 7.3.3. Children X  X  suggestions for improving the ICDL
We asked two questions about improving the ICDL, one was  X  X  X hat do you think the ICDL should do for you X  X ? and another was  X  X  X hat should the ICDL improve for you X  X ? Since the answers to these two questions overlapped, we combined the answers wherever is possible. Most children (70%) commented again on the small Arabic collection and recommended the addition of new and more books. Three children (30%) sug-gested the addition of an audio option to listen to books while reading them, and one child (10%) did not like this option. Three children (30%) suggested the inclusion of an English X  X rabic dictionary to look up the English text and find the Arabic translation. Five children (50%) desired space to draw and color book characters, as one child noted:  X  X  X  have to be able to color books X  X , and another one expected the ICDL to teach children  X  X  X ow to read, use the computer, draw, and color books X  X . Interestingly, one child said that the ICDL  X  X  X hould be kept clean X  X . This child believed that the ICDL was part of Bib. Alex. and since the latter was always clean the ICDL should be protected by keeping it clean.

In addition, all children expressed that the ICDL would have been easier had it been in Arabic. They appre-ciated exposure to the brief ICDL demonstration because it made it easy to use. The fact that an Arabic ver-sion of the ICDL has recently become available may support this need.

In brief, children X  X  suggestions were grouped into three categories: Collection, language, and capabilities ( Table 5 ). In terms of collection, children suggested increase of the Arabic book collection and include books that are different from those owned by Bib. Alex. With regard to language, having an Arabic language interface of the ICDL was a high priority for the children. As for capabilities, children expressed a variety of needs, including keyword searching in Arabic, an audio option, a space to draw and color books, and a bilin-gual dictionary. System designers should consider these suggestions to provide interfaces that support chil-dren X  X  information seeking and needs. 8. Discussion
This study examined Arabic-speaking children X  X  information seeking, success, and affective experience in using the ICDL. The results are discussed within the context of the research questions posed.
 Question 1: What information seeking behavior do Arabic-speaking children exhibit in interacting with the ICDL? Arabic-speaking children interacted with the ICDL to find Arabic books on four tasks. Prior to using the
ICDL, children were given a brief demonstration of the ICDL various search and browse features. Children relied on the Simple interface and browsed under  X  X  X rabic X  X  from the pull-down menu to find books. While in a prior study, Reuter and Druin (2004) reported a high number of keyword searching by children, this study showed that the Keyword search option was avoided, especially because it did not support searching or retrie-val by Arabic keywords. In addition, children did not utilize the Advanced interface option to browse by sub-ject categories, although they were introduced to this feature during the demonstration. Lack of browsing by categories may be due either to the language of the interface (i.e., English) that required understanding of the meaning of each subject category, or to the fact that these categories were not represented by icons to facilitate this understanding.

Only one child attempted the Location search, pointed the mouse to the globe, but immediately returned to the Simple interface to find books. The fact that the Location search requires knowledge of geography, espe-cially the part of the world where a region or country is located, may have been difficult for this child. To find
Arabic books using the Location option, for example, the child needs to spin the globe, point to Asia, and then click on Middle East. This action results in a display of books not only in Arabic, but also in many other lan-guages such as Persian, Hebrew, and Pilipino. The multilayered visual browsing for finding a specific region from the Location option along with the display of books in languages that include Arabic and non-Arabic may be confusing to children who lack both knowledge of world geography and the command of the English language. Listing Pilipino books under the Middle East can be misleading, since the Philippines is not located in that region.
 The infrequent use of the Location option by Arabic-speaking children was incongruent with the findings of
Reuter and Druin (2004) who observed that the World area (part of the Location option) was more popular with younger than older children, and that all children used the World Area slightly more often than the cate-gories area (part of the Advanced option). These contradictory results may be due to prior knowledge of World geography, understanding the interface representations of the World Area, and English language skills.
The differences in backgrounds and cultures between the children who participated in these two studies may have also contributed to these incongruent findings.

Question 2: How successful are Arabic-speaking children in finding Arabic books on the four tasks, and how much time do they spend on completing each task in the ICDL?
Children X  X  success on the four tasks varied. While all children completed task four successfully ( find any book in Arabic and read as many pages as you can ), not all of them did so on the other three tasks. The two children who failed task one did so for different reasons. One child provided the wrong answer (37 instead of 26 books), and another did not transcribe the answer on the task sheet. Based on the researchers X  observa-tional notes, the first child counted each of the Arabic book thumbnails on every returned screen. It is possible that the child got disoriented or lost within the various screens of thumbnails, which resulted in miscounting the books. The second child may have not paid attention to the task requirement. The fact that this child also skipped task two indicates lack of focus in completing these tasks.

Arabic-speaking children were more successful in finding information on the fully self-generated task (task four) than on the other tasks (assigned and semi-assigned). On this task, children were asked to find any book in Arabic to read. The fact that children were given the opportunity to find and read books on topics of inter-est to them may have contributed to the high success on this task. In addition, since two children selected and read two books instead of one book each further ascertains children X  X  liking of this task. This finding is con-gruent with prior Web research ( Bilal, 2002; Hirsh, 1997 ) that found children to be more successful and sat-provides children with a sense of achievement, authority, and independence; factors that are motivating for achieving success.
 Question 3: What perceptions and affective states do Arabic-speaking children possess about the ICDL?
As was mentioned earlier, Arabic-speaking children were interviewed in a group of five upon completion of the ICDL tasks to obtain their perceptions about their experience, elicit their affective states, and gather their feedback about improving the design of the ICDL.

Children had positive perceptions of the ICDL and enjoyed using it. However, the differences in children X  X  feelings before and after interacting with the ICDL (negative vs. positive) can be contributed to many factors: study), and exposure to new experience of reading Arabic books online. In addition, children X  X  introduction to how to use the ICDL prior to interacting with it subsidized their anxiety, fear, and uncertainty. Moreover, the presence of the researchers throughout data collection and the assistance they provided, as needed, provided affective support and minimized negative feelings. 9. Implications
The findings of this study have implications for practitioners who interact with these children, for research-ers who are interested in exploring children X  X  use of the ICDL, and for system designers.

Practitioners should provide effective training in using the ICDL, especially since Bib. Alex. is the leading library in Arabic-speaking countries that contribute books to the ICDL project. This study revealed that only one Arabic-speaking child was familiar with the ICDL, and that this child was introduced to it through his/her mother who was a staff member at Bib. Alex children X  X  library. Bib. Alex. staff should promote use of the
ICDL to motivate children and reinforce their reading habits. The fact that children requested a larger Arabic book collection delineates a need for digitizing additional books to contribute to the ICDL. In addition, Bib.
Alex. staff should promote book digitization throughout the Arab world and collaborate with other libraries in that region to provide a strong Arabic book collection that is supportive of children X  X  reading needs. As the
Internet becomes widely used at home, Arabic-speaking children will be able to read book from remote loca-tions and at their own convenience.

To date, research that investigated children X  X  use of the ICDL has considered their thoughts and actions and precluded affect, despite the fact that the ICDL was developed based on both children X  X  cognitive abilities and affective preferences for books (e.g., sad, happy). To obtain a holistic view of children X  X  interaction with the ICDL, both cognition and affect should be examined, in addition to actions ( Kuhlthau, 2004; Nahl, 2004 ). This study showed that many children experienced anxiety, uncertainty, and fear before using the ICDL.
However, the affective support the researchers provided minimized children X  X  negative feelings. Therefore, researchers who involve children of similar backgrounds and/or experiences should develop effective strategies to assist children to cope with negative emotions or feelings in order to sustain an environment that is sup-portive of children X  X  information seeking.

Eliciting children X  X  recommendations for improving the ICDL generated design features that system design-ers should take into account as they introduce new interfaces or modify existing ones. Children requested an Arabic version of the ICDL that supports keyword searching in Arabic. It is hoped that the recently added
Arabic version of the ICDL should meet this need. In addition, children suggested addition of an audio option to listen to books while reading them, and inclusion of bilingual dictionaries (e.g., English X  X rabic) to translate the meaning of the ICDL representations. Moreover, they desired a drawing and coloring feature. System designers should assess the feasibility of providing space for children to draw and color book characters.
Drawing is a vehicle for children to express feelings, thoughts, and perceptions. What children draw is influ-enced by their stage of development, social environment, and cultural influences ( Malchiodi, 1998 ). Thus, sys-tem designers can gain knowledge not only about children X  X  needs and wishes, but also about their cultural preferences so that they design interfaces that meet their needs ( Bilal, 2003 ). 10. Conclusions
This study revealed that contrary to children X  X  use of the ICDL in the United States ( Reuter &amp; Druin, 2004 ), Arabic-speaking children X  X  information seeking behavior in the ICDL was characterized by browsing using a single function; that is, clicking on  X  X  X rabic X  X  from the pull-down menu of the Simple interface to find
Arabic books. Despite the fact that they were introduced to how to use the ICDL, children did not browse by subject categories, and only one child activated the Location option but did use it. In addition, children did not search by keyword since this feature did not support Arabic keywords. Additional research is needed to contribute to our understanding of the differences and similarities in information seeking behavior between children in the United States and children of diverse cultures, including the Arabic culture.

Children X  X  success on the four tasks was assessed based on a measure the researchers developed. In this study, children X  X  success on specific tasks was evaluated according to both viewing a child X  X  captured ICDL sessions and examining the child X  X  transcribed answers on the task sheets. Using a  X  X  X efinite X  X  measure for judg-ing success is recommended in future research, especially in studies that employ both quantitative and qual-itative inquiry methods for data collection.

The tasks children performed varied in terms of nature (closed vs. open-ended), type (simple vs. complex) and administration (assigned, semi-assigned, and fully self-generated). The structure of these tasks was based on the task taxonomy developed by Bilal (2002) . Children were more successful on the fully self-generated task that was open-ended than on the assigned and semi-assigned tasks; thus, confirming prior research by Bilal and motivate them to perform them successfully.

This study explored children X  X  thoughts, actions, and affective states in using the ICDL. Using this triad provided a holistic view of children X  X  information seeking behavior in the ICDL. Researchers are encouraged to consider this triad in future research, especially since the  X  X  X ffective paradigm X  X  in information seeking has recently emerged to supplement the cognitive paradigm ( Bilal, 2005 ).

This study revealed that Arabic-speaking children seek information in the ICDL differently from children of other cultures (i.e., United States), and that they have unique system design needs. As children X  X  use of the
ICDL grows worldwide and as versions of its interfaces become available in various languages, additional research will be needed to contribute to our understanding of the influence of culture on children X  X  infor-mation seeking in the ICDL. Results from such research endeavors will provide insights into the interfaces that system designers should develop and make customizable for children of various cultures and backgrounds.

 1. Introduction  X  X  X he on-line digital environment provides an unprecedented, powerful arena for youth to obtain informa-tion to participate in global learning communities X  X  ( Dresang, 1999, p. 1123 ). The exponential growth of Web technologies has provided system developers and scholars with the means for developing digital libraries that allow young users to interact with well-organized information and to understand the cultural heritage of the world around them.

Prior research has shown that while children enjoy using various technologies (e.g., multimedia encyclope-dias, online catalogs, and the Web), they experience difficulty formulating adequate search strategies, commit spelling errors, use Boolean operators incorrectly, and employ search syntax that is not supported in the sys-1997; Large, Beheshti, &amp; Breuleux, 1998; Large, Beheshti, &amp; Rahman, 2002; Marchionini, 1989; Revelle et al., 2000; Schacter, Chung, &amp; Dorr, 1998; Solomon, 1993; Wallace &amp; Kupperman, 1997 ).
Although many information retrieval systems (IRs) are intended for children, they do not support chil-dren X  X  information seeking or build on their cognitive developmental abilities ( Bilal, 2000, 2001, 2002; Bilal International Children X  X  Digital Library (ICDL).

The ICDL provides an international collection of digital books for children ages 3 X 13. It is designed to cre-parents, researchers, and scholars worldwide via the Internet.

The ICDL was launched on November 18, 2002. It is funded by the National Science Foundation and led by both the University of Maryland and Internet Archive to expose children to different cultures through lit-erature. At the time of the study (December 2004), this digital library contained 820 books representing over 33 languages including a collection of books in the Arabic language ( http://www.icdlbooks.org ).
Studies about use of the ICDL have mainly focused on users X  characteristics (e.g., age, gender, children, parents, and teachers) ( Druin, 2005 ), children X  X  book selection and searching behaviors ( Reuter &amp; Druin, 2004 ), and evaluation of subject categories ( Hutchinson et al., 2004 ). While these studies provided insights about the children X  X  searching and browsing behaviors in locating books, they precluded assessment of children X  X  understanding of the ICDL system design representations (e.g., icons, buttons, search and browse features, and other visual cues), and they only included children in the United States. As an international, multi-cultural, and multilingual digital library, the ICDL is to be shared by heterogeneous users from diverse cultures around the world through literature. Since the ICDL has an Arabic book collection, it becomes nec-essary to examine Arabic-speaking children X  X  interaction with the ICDL and to explore their understanding of its system design representations and their meanings. The present study is the first attempt towards achieving this goal.

Findings from this study will provide understanding of the utility of the ICDL system design representa-tions and navigation controls to culturally diverse children (i.e., Arabic-speaking), and will generate sugges-tions for system design improvements that are supportive of the children X  X  information needs. 2. Culture and international system design What does a  X  X  X rash can X  X  icon mean to Arabic-speaking children? How do we measure the utility of the
ICDL for culturally diverse children such as those from Arabic-speaking countries? Hofstede defines culture as  X  X  X he collective mental programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one group or category are the mental programs that a group of people has acquired and learned throughout a lifetime. In studying the culture of a group of people, one may need to examine the norms or patterns of life of these people includ-face design -from character sets (e.g., the Latin alphabet) to icons, colors, menu accelerators, and documentation ( Del Galdo, 1990 ). Smith et al. (2004) coined the term  X  X  X ultural attractors X  X  to describe the uniform representation of information whereas the  X  X  X eel X  X  is the interaction with the various elements of the interface ( Callahan, 2005 ).

In the Human X  X omputer Interaction (HCI) field, cultural variability in interface design is approached in terms of both internationalization and localization. Internationalization centers on the core functionality of the software that is independent from localized interface details, and separates the cultural elements from the software (e.g., language, character sets, culturally meaningful icons) whereas localization addresses customizing an interface for a particular culture through implementation of the cultural elements. Bourges-
Waldegg and Scrivener (1998) argue that this internalization-localization is inappropriate for assessing the and insensitivity to bi-and multilingualism and other forms of cultural heterogeneity. They note that factors guage, taste, and other visual communication) reside in the  X  X  X ultural variability X  X  of representations ( Del
Galdo, 1996; Fernandes, 1995 ), and since language is a representational system, it should be accounted for only when it becomes a barrier to understanding representations and their meanings.

In retrospect, our examination of the cross-cultural usability of the ICDL system design to Arabic-speaking children is grounded in both  X  X  X esign representations X  X  and  X  X  X eaning X  X  rather than in internationalization and localization. This means that regardless of  X  X  X anguage X  X , an international user interface should be understood by culturally diverse users. In addition, our assessment of the ICDL is rooted in the user-centered system design concept that measures the utility of any information retrieval system based on its  X  X  X epresentation fore, we argue that the more understanding Arabic-speaking children have of the ICDL system design repre-sentations and their meanings, the more adequate these representations are for this group of users. Similarly, we consider that the more Arabic-speaking children use the ICDL navigation controls, the more usable these controls are for these children. 3. ICDL interfaces The ICDL main interface ( Fig. 1 ) includes four search options: Simple, Advanced, Location, and Keyword.
The Simple Search option provides a graphical interface to popular book categories that allows selection of books based on 12 criteria (e.g., age, size, color, make believe, chapter books, picture books) and on a lan-menu at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on the icon more shows additional categories, such as Sad, Happy, Pop up books, Series, and Short Story books.

The Advanced Search option ( Fig. 3 ) is text-based and offers a browsing mechanism of books based on hierarchies of subject categories. It includes five main categories and subsequent subcategories.
The Location Search option has two interfaces: graphical and text-based. The graphical interface allows searching for books by clicking on a continent and spinning the globe ( Fig. 4 ). The text-based interface displays a menu of continents to search. Once visited, both of these interfaces provide a variety of options including display (book cover, text), sorting (by title, author, illustrator, language, and publication), and searching (by language).

The Keyword Search provides many options for finding books, including searching by title, author, illus-trator, and subject keywords. To retrieve Arabic books by keyword using any of these options, the English language is required. 4. Arabic books collection
The Arabic book collection ( Fig. 5 ) is accessible from all of the ICDL interfaces. At the time of data col-lection (December 2004), the ICDL had 26 books in the Arabic language. The books were geared for children ages 3 X 10 and included these categories: Fairy Tales and Folk Tales, Short Story Books, Real Animal
Characters, Make Believe Books, and Picture Books. These books could be searched by only one color out of six (green). 5. Related literature
Assessing the usability of the ICDL system design representations and navigation controls to Arabic-speak-ing children were based on related literature in system design for children.

Many researchers argue that involving children in the design of system interfaces is essential for supporting their cognitive developmental ability, motor skills, information processing, navigating, and searching and for Web engines, and categorizing topics for designing Web directories.

Large and Beheshti (2000) and Large et al. (2002) gathered middle school children X  X  reactions to the utility of Yahooligans!, AskJeeves for Kids, KidsClick!, and Lycos Zone. Based on children X  X  use of each of these engines/directories, the researchers generated these design characteristics: goals, visual design, information architecture, and personalization. Children appreciated a Web portal that provides both educational and entertainment topics. In their view, the visual design of a successful portal is one with a fun name, colorful backgrounds and foregrounds, large fonts, graphics and animation, recognizable characters, suitable vocab-ulary, well laid out screens, and no advertisements. In addition, children preferred a portal with information guage searching, browsing through subject hierarchies, links to external search engines, display of informative summaries of the returned results, and spell-checking techniques. The feedback the authors obtained from the children was highly usable as it provided a framework for designing two actual Web search engines for them.
In a follow-up study, Large et al. (2004) collaborated with middle and elementary school children and designed an engine for each group about history. The design characteristics the authors generated were similar to those found by Neilsen (2002) in a study of children X  X  interaction with Web sites in the United States and overseas.

Using a different approach, Bilal (2003) collected drawings of Web interfaces from eleven middle school children using paper, pencil, and color crayons. The interfaces children drew were grouped into three catego-combined both simple and sophisticated design. The simple design included the name of the engine, a search box, and minimal subject categories. The sophisticated design entailed additional features such as two search boxes, one for keyword and another for natural language, instructions on how to perform a search, linking to faces illuminated the system design characteristics and kind of information architecture that meet their needs of which many were aligned with those found by other researchers ( Large et al., 2004; Neilsen, 2002 ). developed for children (Yahooligans! and KidsClick!), Bilal and Wang (2005) examined middle school chil-dren X  X  cognitive structures of science categories that were extracted from these directories. Children con-structed concept maps for each science category extracted from each of these engines/directories. At the global level (whole map), children X  X  maps were not alike and did not match with the structures of the Web directories. At the local levels (super-ordinate and subordinate), however, children had similarities among their structures, especially for concrete concepts (e.g., animals). For these, substantial matches were found between the children X  X  structures and those employed in the two directories. However, children X  X  organization inappropriate for children, and provided guidelines for designing taxonomies to support children X  X  Web browsing.

Involving children in the design of interfaces emerged from the HCI field. Much of the work in this area has been accomplished by Druin (2002, Druin et al., 2003; Druin 2005) who developed successful interfaces that resulted in launching the International Children X  X  Digital Library (ICDL). One of these interfaces is SearchK-information processing, and motor skills. This library allows children to search and browse for information about animals by clicking on visual icons rather than typing and constructing queries. Children can also find information by browsing subject hierarchies or by clicking on a specific geographic area on the globe. The visual design of SearchKids supported children X  X  searching and browsing through recognition of keywords rather than through recalling them from memory. The success of SearchKids (also named QueryKids) has resulted in the design and development of the ICDL ( Hutchinson et al., 2004 ).

The reviewed literature show that children can be effective partners in designing digital interfaces and that involving them in the design process could provide interfaces that offer high usability for them. To date, how-ever, most of the design of interfaces has involved children of similar cultures and where language is uniform those from Arabic-speaking countries? 6. Research questions
The research questions below addressed Arabic-speaking children X  X  understanding of the ICDL system design representations and their meanings (icons, buttons, search and browse features, and other visual cues), and use of the ICDL navigation controls (buttons, accelerators, and icons). 1. To what extent do Arabic-speaking children understand the ICDL system design representations and their meanings? 2. To what extent does the design of the ICDL navigation controls (buttons, accelerators, and icons) support
Arabic-speaking children X  X  navigation of the ICDL? 3. How does Arabic-speaking children X  X  use of the ICDL navigation controls (back, forward, home) compare to their use of these controls in Internet Explorer? 7. Method
This study employed both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative method provided empir-ical data about children X  X  navigation behavior in finding books. Data were captured via HyperCam, a video logging software package that records and replays captured online activities. The qualitative method elicited information about children X  X  understanding of the ICDL system design representations and their meanings (i.e., identification of icons, buttons, search and browse features, and other visual cues). 7.1. Participants
This study used a convenient sample and relied on voluntary participation. Children were recruited by the children X  X  librarian at Bibliotheca Alexandrina (Bib. Alex.) where the study took place. The librarian con-tacted the parents of fifteen children via telephone and informed them about the purpose of the study. The librarian obtained the initial permission of ten parents. Upon the researchers X  request, one group of five par-ents and their children came to the library on December 24, 2004 and another group participated on December 25, 2004. After the parents and children signed consent forms, the resulting sample consisted of four male and six female children, ages 6 X 10. One child was six-year-old, three were seven-year-old, two were eight, two were nine, one child was nine and a half and another one was 10-year-old (see Appendix 1 for a children X  X  profile). much data to be coded and analyzed. 7.2. Setting
The study took place in Bib. Alex. Children X  X  Library. The qualitative data were collected in the reading room at the library and the quantitative data were gathered at Bib. Alex. Information and Computer Tech-nology Laboratory (ICTL) since the computers in the Library did not meet the hardware requirements of
HyperCam software. 7.3. Procedures
The design of the study was planned in October 2004. The director, head librarian, and the technology team at Bib. Alex. were contacted via email and their consent to use Bib. Alex. for data collection was obtained.
Parental and child consent forms in both English and Arabic languages were developed to meet the Institu-tional Review Board (IRB) requirements for conducting this study. The Arabic language was used throughout procedures list, and ICDL tasks) were created to guide the researchers in data collection.
 Data were gathered on December 24 and 25, 2004. On December 23, 2004, the researchers met with Bib. engineer to discuss the details of the study including hardware needs. The technology specialist and computer engineer tested HyperCam and installed it on five computers in the ICTL.

On December 24, a group of five children used the ICDL. Each child was interviewed individually and later escorted to the ICTL to use the ICDL. Meanwhile, the technology specialist ensured that HyperCam was up and working properly on each of the designated computers and that the ICDL website ( http://www.icdl-books.org ) was ready for use. The same method was repeated with the second group of children who used the ICDL on December 25.

Children were shown the ICDL default interface and were asked to identify the system design representa-tions in the interface (search and browse options). In addition, they were exposed to the Simple interface and asked to identify the various icons and buttons embedded in it. Second, children were given four written tasks in the Arabic language to perform in the ICDL. These were read and explained to them by the researchers to ensure understanding (see Appendix 2 for the English version of these tasks). Upon completion of the tasks,
ICDL, suggestions for improving it, and affective experience. The interviews were audio-recorded and children X  X  responses were, in addition, transcribed by one of the researchers to ensure no data loss. Data gen-2006 ). 7.4. Individual interviews
Prior to using the ICDL, children in each group were interviewed individually using a structured opening questionnaire instrument that was developed by the researchers ( Appendix 3 ). The questions included demo-graphic information (gender, grade level, age, English language proficiency), prior experience (about comput-ers, the Web, and the ICDL), English language proficiency, and reading habits (number of books read weekly, kind of books read, language of books read). Children X  X  response to each question asked was transcribed by one of the researchers. Data gathered from the interviews provided a profile of the children that assisted in interpreting data generated from the quantitative method. 7.5. ICDL sessions
Two ICDL sessions were held in the ICTL, one on December 24 and another on December 25. Each session included a brief demonstration of the ICDL, questions about the ICDL system design representations and their meanings, finding books on the four tasks, and answering questions about the ICDL system design.
HyperCam screen-captured children X  X  interaction in performing the four ICDL tasks (searching, browsing, navigating, and selecting and reading Arabic books). Upon completion, each captured ICDL session (one per child) was saved on the computer used and later transferred electronically to a designated file server in
Bib. Alex. All transferred ICDL sessions were later burned onto CDs by the technology specialist and given to the researchers. Each CD was tested to ensure that the captured data replayed successfully from initiation to completion and that no data were lost. 7.6. ICDL tasks
Since the fundamental parts of testing an international user interface is to involve real users and to give to perform in the ICDL: (1) How many books does the ICDL have in the Arabic language ; (2) Find a book in the
Arabic language named Dima and open the first page of the book ; (3) Find a book about animals in the Arabic language and write the name of the book on your sheet ; and (4) Find any book in Arabic and read as many pages as you can ( Appendix 2 ). To ensure confidentially, each child was assigned a number that was used throughout data collection. 7.7. Group interviews
Children were interviewed in groups of five at the conclusion of their ICDL sessions and after taking a short break. One group was interviewed on Friday, December 24 and another on Saturday, December 25 using a questionnaire instrument the researchers developed. Children were asked questions about their perceptions of and affective experience with the ICDL. The results of questionnaire data are provided in part two of this study. 8. Data analysis
This part of the study produced three data sets: one set from the individual interviews, one set from iden-tifying the ICDL system design representations and their meanings, and one set from navigating the ICDL.
Data generated from the individual interviews were coded and analyzed and descriptive statistics were generated. Children X  X  identification of the ICDL system design representations and their meanings (icons, buttons, search and browse features, and other visual cues) were coded, analyzed, and percentages were gen-erated (to answer research question one). Similarly, children X  X  use of the ICDL various navigation controls (e.g., back arrows, icons, page activation, and forward arrows) were coded, analyzed, and percentages were generated (to answer research question two). Data generated from children X  X  use of both the ICDL and Inter-net Explorer navigation controls (i.e., back, forward, and home) were coded, analyzed, and compared using descriptive statistics (to answer research question 3). 9. Measure
Arabic-speaking children X  X  understanding of the ICDL system design representations and their meanings was assessed based on  X  X  X epresentations X  X  and  X  X  X eaning X  X  rather than on internationalization and localiza-tion. In their example of judging appropriateness of an international interface to culturally diverse users,
Bourges-Waldegg and Scrivener (1998) consider that if 98% of these users understand that interface repre-sentations and their meanings, then these representations are deemed appropriate for them. However, they also mention that if 87% of the users do not understand these representations and their meanings, then the interface could be judged as inadequate for them. These percentages are arbitrary since they are not based on a specific scale or measure. Neilsen (1996) argues that while there is no definite measure for assessing the usability of a user interface, 80% of user success makes the interface appropriate. In retrospect, we developed a measure that is a middle ground between what Neilsen (1996) and Bourges-Waldegg and
Scrivener (1998) consider as appropriate and inappropriate. Based on this measure, the appropriateness of ICDL system design representations and their meanings to Arabic-speaking children is assessed as follows:
If 95 X 100% of the children recognize and interpret the meaning of an icon (or any other design represen-tation) correctly, then the icon is judged as highly appropriate for this user group.

If 90 X 94% of the children recognize and interpret the meaning of an icon correctly, then the icon is judged as moderately appropriate for this user group.

If 85 X 89% of the children understand and interpret the meaning of an icon correctly, then the icon is judged as appropriate (or average) for this user group.

If 84% or below of the children understand and interpret the meaning of an icon correctly or incorrectly, then the icon is judged as inappropriate for this user group.

Another assessment factor we considered is the  X  X  X anguage X  X  of the ICDL interface (i.e., English). We accounted for  X  X  X anguage X  X  only when it became a barrier to Arabic-speaking children X  X  understanding. This is because the assessment of the ICDL is grounded in  X  X  X epresentations X  X  and  X  X  X eaning X  X  rather than in inter-nationalization and localization ( Bourges-Waldegg &amp; Scrivener, 1998 ).
 10. Limitations of the study
This study examined a group of Arabic-speaking children X  X  interaction with the ICDL in Egypt and assessed their understanding of its system design representations and their meanings and the utility of its navigation controls. The limitation of this study concerns absence of concurrent verbalization of children X  X  navigation of the ICDL that could have provided interpretation about certain actions children performed.
Another limitation relates to the researchers X  inability to replay each child X  X  ICDL session and obtain feed-back from the child to interpret certain actions. The field notes the researchers took during data collection along with the group interviews clarified and interpreted such actions. 11. Results
This study addressed these research questions: (1) To what extent do Arabic-speaking children understand the ICDL system design representations and their meanings (icons, buttons, search and browse features, and other visual cues)? (2) To what extent does the design of the ICDL navigation controls (buttons, accelerators, and icons) support Arabic-speaking children X  X  navigation of the ICDL? and (3) How does Arabic-speaking children X  X  use of the ICDL navigation controls compare to their use of these controls in Internet Explorer?
The results are reported within the context of each research question posed. 11.1. To what extent do Arabic-speaking children understand the ICDL system design representations and their meanings (icons, buttons, search and browse features, and other visual cues)?
To answer this question, we asked Arabic-speaking children to identify the ICDL representations and their meanings from both the ICDL default and Simple interfaces. 11.1.1. Default interface
The default interface offers these search and browse options: Simple, Advanced, Location, and Keyword searching. Children were asked to identify each of these options and describe their meanings. Eight chil-dren (80%) recognized the Keyword search option through the search box (visual cue) but were unable to identify the other options and their meanings (Simple, Advanced, Location). According to the appro-priateness measure, these options are judged inappropriate for the children. However, when we found that only younger children had problems identifying these options, we divided children into two groups: a younger group (two children, ages 6 X 7) and an older group (eight children, ages 8 X 10) and reassessed the appropriateness of these representations accordingly. We concluded that the Keyword search option was highly appropriate for older children but inappropriate for younger ones (rating = 100% vs. rating = 0, respectively).

As to the other options (Simple, Advanced, and Location), none of the children recognized them, although each option was also represented by an icon appearing next to it. These representations were judged as inap-standing of the meaning of these representations, the icons the represent them should have facilitated children X  X  understanding ( Table 1 ). 11.1.2. Simple interface
The Simple interface included four navigational icons that are located on the left side of the ICDL top nav-igation bar: Home (to return to main screen), a question mark (to seek help), a back arrow (to return to a previous screen), and a trash can (to start over). Children were asked to identify these icons and their mean-ings. Older children recognized and understood the meaning of these icons, except for the  X  X  X rash can X  X  icon.
These three icons are considered highly appropriate for older children (rating = 100%). However, recognizing designers, especially since children interpreted it based on its commonly known meaning worldwide: deleting files ( Marcus, 1996 ). Younger children did not recognize any of the icons and their meanings and, thus, these representations were judged inappropriate for these children (rating = 0).
The ICDL Simple interface embeds twenty additional icons that allow searching for books by theme (8 icons), size (3 icons), age (3 icons), and color (6 icons). Older children recognized these icons and under-stood their meanings, but younger children did not (rating = 100% vs. rating = 0, respectively) ( Table 2 ).
In fact, younger children had difficulty with all ICDL representations. This may be attributed to children X  X  lack of experience in using the Internet (see Appendix 1 ). 11.2. To what extent does the design of the ICDL navigation controls (buttons, accelerators, and icons) support Arabic-speaking children X  X  navigation of the ICDL?
Searching by Arabic language from the Simple interface displays thumbnails of eight books per screen and clicking on a thumbnail shows one or two book pages at a time per screen. We coded the representations (icons, buttons, and other visual cues) that appear when such thumbnails and book pages are displayed.
We counted the number of clicks a child made on each of these representations. From an Arabic book page, for example, we coded these representations: Home icon (N4), question mark icon (N5), back arrow icon (N6), minus sign icon (N7), plus sign icon (N8) and the open book icon (N9). The Arabic book page also shows four buttons, two at the top right side corner and two at the bottom right side corner. The ones at the top were coded N10 (back arrow) and N11 (forward arrow). The ones at the bottom were coded N12 (back arrow) and N13 (forward arrow). From the thumbnails page, we coded the buttons that reside in the middle of the page as N17 (back arrow) and N18 (forward arrow).

Children clicked on the back arrow (N17) 23 times and on the forward arrow (N18) 43 times to move back and forth within the book thumbnails. As seen in Table 3 , children activated these four buttons the most: back arrow (N11), forward arrow (N12), plus sign icon (to maximize the size of a book image) (N10), and home icon (N4). Seventy-percent (70%) of the children clicked on these buttons while the rest (30%) clicked on book illustrations to navigate within book pages.

In addition to these controls, the ICDL supports navigation within book pages by clicking on an Arabic book page number, on any part of a book page, and on any part of a book illustration page. Seven children (70%) clicked on Arabic book page numbers to advance to next pages and three (30%) clicked on a location in book pages and/or on book illustrations. It is evident that the design of the ICDL did not rely on the navi-gation controls of a Web browser such as Internet Explorer to support navigation; rather, it provided multiple controls that served as accelerators and facilitated children X  X  efficient navigation. 11.3. How does children X  X  use of the ICDL navigation controls (back, forward, home) compare to their use of these controls in internet explorer?
To answer this question, we coded specific navigation controls in the ICDL and Internet Explorer that pro-vided similar functions (i.e., back, forward, and home). It is noteworthy that the ICDL supported going back-wards by providing back arrow buttons in multiple places on a screen, whereas Internet Explorer showed the
ICDL navigation controls more frequently than they did Internet Explorer controls (158 vs. 52 times, respec-tively). In addition, they used the  X  X  X ack X  X  function in both the ICDL and Internet Explorer combined more frequently than they did the Forward function or home icon (117 vs. 79 vs. 14, respectively). In going back to the original destination (Home), children relied on the ICDL Home icon and did not use the browser X  X 
Home icon. 12. Discussion
This study assessed the cross-cultural usability of the ICDL to a group of Arabic-speaking children, ages the design of the ICDL navigation controls is discussed in terms of its use by Arabic-speaking children and its support of their navigation. 12.1. Representations and meaning
This study revealed that the most of the ICDL representations were more supportive of older than younger children X  X  understanding. The fact that younger children did not recognize any of the representations embed-experience in using the Internet, (b) lack of cognitive preparation to interact with a system such as the ICDL, and (c) the language of the interface (i.e., English). Although these two children had prior experience with computers (based on the profile in Appendix 1 ), they did not possess experience in using the Internet. Not being exposed to interfaces such as the ICDL, which is GUI-based, combined with absence of English lan-guage skills made it more difficult for these children. Congruent with a prior study by Reuter and Druin (2004) that included a large sample of children, in this study, younger children experienced more difficulty in using the ICDL than older children. System designers should develop interfaces that are geared towards younger children X  X  understanding and information seeking.

Older children (ages 8 X 10) recognized most of the ICDL representations and their meanings. From the default interface, for example, they recognized the Keyword search option and understood its intended mean-ing through the search box (visual cue). The fact that the search box is commonly known among computer and Internet users worldwide and the fact that most children were computer users made this visual cue easy to recognize. However, these children did not recognize the other three options (Simple, Advanced, Location) from this interface. This finding may be due to either the language of the interface and/or to the inadequate design of the icons that represent them. It could be that because they are very small and hardly noticeable, these icons were ineffective in that they did not draw children X  X  attention to click on them or to understand their meaning. System designers should consider improving the design of these options to make them more meaningful and appealing to children.

The ICDL representations in the Simple interface option were more supportive of Arabic-speaking chil-dren X  X  understanding than those that were in the default interface (mostly textual). Older children recog-nized all the representations understood their meanings except for the  X  X  X rash X  X  icon that appeared at top of the ICDL navigation bar. In fact, children recognized this icon and articulated its intended meaning correctly (a recycling bin). However, the intended meaning given in the ICDL was to start over . The mean-ing of this icon should be reconsidered to conform to its universal meaning (deleting files). Marcus (1996) notes that in using computers and the Internet, certain icons have become archetypical signs recognized by computer users throughout the world and that the  X  X  X rash can X  X  icon is one of these signs. As is, this icon can be misleading not only to Arabic-speaking children, but also to users regardless of their cultural backgrounds. 12.2. ICDL navigation controls
The ICDL navigation controls were effective for younger and older children. These iconic controls (e.g., back and forward arrows, book page navigation) provided a variety of options to navigate within book pages.
Being able to advance to the next book page by either clicking on one of the forward arrows or on any space of pared to their equivalent controls in Internet Explorer (back, forward, and home). Children relied on these three ICDL controls much more than on those in the browser, indicating that the design of these controls were developed based on children X  X  navigation behavior and needs.

One of the findings of this study concerned use of the back buttons in both the ICDL and Internet Explorer more than they did the forward or home buttons, confirming prior research on children X  X  interaction with the whereas in the present study, children X  X  use of this function supported their navigation.

The results of this study revealed that regardless of the language of the ICDL interface (i.e., English), Ara-bic-speaking children, especially older ones, recognized most of its interface representations and understood their meanings. The assessment approach we employed (representations and meaning) was effective, especially since at the time of the study, the ICDL design was not localized for any culture beyond the United States.
Using  X  X  X epresentations X  X  and  X  X  X eaning X  X  supports Bourges-Waldegg and Scrivener X  X  approach (1998) of cross-cultural usability assessment of an international user interface. Additional research is recommended in this area of study to gain better understanding of the utility of the ICDL to children of various cultures and backgrounds. 12.3. System design recommendations
The results of this study have implications for improving the ICDL interface design for culturally diverse children, especially Arabic-speaking. Younger children had difficulty understanding all the representations of the ICDL. Providing a simple visual interface that is enhanced with meaningful and noticeable icons along with audio capabilities may assist younger children not only in understanding the meaning of the ICDL rep-resentations, but also in seeking information.

The text-based browse and search functions in the default interface should be sustained with well-designed icons that can be easily recognized by children of various cultures. Providing this design feature could com-pensate for children X  X  lack of, or minimal knowledge of, the English language.

Another recommendation concerns the meaning of the  X  X  X rash X  X  can icon that system designers should reconsider to reflect its universal meaning as a recycling bin or deleting files rather than to start over. 13. Conclusions
The results of this study showed that the ICDL interface design representations were more supportive of older than younger Arabic-speaking children. Due to voluntary participation in this study, only two younger children were included. Despite this small number, this finding establishes a basis for further research with a larger sample of younger children. Such an endeavor would add to our understanding of the utility of the
ICDL representations to younger children of various cultures and, subsequently, could generate guidelines for system design improvements that are more supportive of this group of users.

The appropriateness measure by which we judged Arabic-speaking children X  X  understanding of the ICDL system design representations and their meanings was effective and its use in future research is recommended.
This definite measure can be employed to assess the usability not only of the ICDL interface design represen-tations, but also of representations in other cross-cultural digital libraries.

The language of the ICDL interface was found to be a barrier to children X  X  understanding of representa-sion of the ICDL has become available. It would be useful to investigate this version with Arabic-speaking standing of the role language plays in children X  X  understanding of the ICDL representations and their meanings.

Unlike information retrieval systems where evaluation is an absolute rule, the evaluation of digital libraries usability of the ICDL. However, much remains to be learned about this area of study. Future research should address the role language plays in understanding representations and their meanings along with searching and browsing the ICDL. In part two of this study, the authors examined Arabic-speaking children X  X  information seeking behavior, success, and affective experience in using the ICDL. Nonetheless, additional research is needed to gain good understanding of the impact of culture on children X  X  interaction with various digital libraries including the ICDL.

The ICDL is designed to be a multicultural and multilingual interface that introduces children to various cultures through literature. However, to be considered a  X  X  X rue X  X  international digital library, ICDL designers should offer interfaces that provide cross-cultural design elements that match children X  X  understanding and expectations of various cultures.
