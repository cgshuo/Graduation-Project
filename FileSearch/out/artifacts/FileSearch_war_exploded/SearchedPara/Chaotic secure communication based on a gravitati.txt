 XiaoHong Han, XiaoMing Chang n 1. Introduction
Chaos, which exists in many highly complex fields of nonlinear science, is a bounded deterministic dynamic behavior that exhi-bits sensitive dependence on initial conditions and includes infinite unstable periodic motions. Chaotic signals can be con-sidered as the carriers of messages in secure communication applications. The idea of applying chaotic systems to secure communication has existed since Pecora and Carroll (1990 ) presented the concept of chaotic synchronization for two iden-unified chaotic system. Chang (2009 ) proposed a method of proposed a means of secure communication based on synchro-nized chaotic systems. In the fields of secure communication, many techniques and methods have been proposed to tackle the problem of chaotic secure communication, including chaotic masking ( Chen and Liao, 2005 ; Milanovic and Zaghloul, 2002 ), modulation ( Tse et al., 2003 ), and anti-phase synchronization noted that all the methods mentioned above do not consider signal. One of the most important problems which limits the communication in the presence of channel noise is becoming an important issue. Some experimental work has already been under-taken. Sun et al. (2008 ) proposed an adaptive chaotic secure communication scheme with channel noise. Zhang et al. (2006 ) chaotic communication method using an extended fractional Kalman filter ( Kiani-B et al., 2009 ).

A further step in order to decrease noise in chaotic secure are employed to keep frequency content in the desired band and
Adaptive digital filters are currently used in many areas, such as noise reduction, communication systems, image processing, and Roy, 2009 ; Farouk and Smith, 2000 ). The main aim of the estimate the parameters of an actual unknown system through its inputs and outputs. In this case, minimization of an objective iterative search algorithms.

However, when the objective function is non-smooth, gradi-ent-based methods often cannot converge towards the global minimum. In this situation, heuristic optimization methods, in optimization problems. Many well-known global optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms (GA) ( Tang et al., 1996 ), swarm optimization (PSO) ( Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995 ) are widely employed to solve filter problems and system identifica-tion ( Badr and Fahmy, 2004 ; van den Bergh and Engelbrecht, 2006 ; Ellabib et al., 2007 ).

Recently, a new heuristic search algorithm, the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), has been proposed, inspired by the
Its main characteristics include both easy implementation and computational efficiency. GSA has a well-balanced and flexible mechanism to improve exploration and exploitation abilities. their work, GSA was proposed to model IIR filters and nonlinear rational filters. But the GSA-based filter modeling has not yet been applied to the problem of chaotic secure communication in the presence of noise.

In this work, GSA is employed to model a nonlinear rational problem of chaotic secure communication in the presence of noise. The effectiveness of the proposed secure communication scheme in the presence of noise in the communication channel is examined through comparisons between the proposed scheme and current state-of-the-art chaotic communication schemes. The main ideas of the proposed method are illustrated by unified

The proposed secure communication scheme based on GSA filter modeling 4.1. The unified chaotic system
The unified chaotic system is a generalized system represent-ing the Lorenz, the L  X  u and the Chen chaotic systems. It is described by system (20): _ x 1  X  X  25 a  X  10  X  X  x 2 x 1  X  _ x 2  X  X  28 35 a  X  x 1 x 1 x 3  X  X  29 a 1  X  x 2 8 &gt; &lt; &gt; :
Obviously, the system (20) is the original Lorenz system for  X  0, while it denotes the original Chen system for a  X  1. When  X  0.8, the system (20) is the critical system. Actually, system communication system, the above unified chaotic system is and recover useful messages. Parameter a of (20) is given an important role because the useful message is encrypted through this parameter.

Consider the demodulation procedure as system (21) ( Hua et al., 2005 ): _ y  X  u x 1 x 2 x where ^ a is the estimate of the parameter a and u denotes a positive constant.
 Theorem. ( Hua et al., 2005 ). The parameter a can be recovered if the time derivative of a is less than a positive constant C -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 -0.2 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.2 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 -0.2 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.2 (20) and system (21). It follows as system (22): 9 e  X  t  X  9 r C where e ( t )  X  a ^ a , u is a positive constant . modeling
In this section, a description of the proposed secure commu-nication scheme is provided. The proposed scheme based on the on chaotic modulation is used to send the encrypted signal an intruder to recover the masked states because the chaotic unified system and its varying parameter a are completely unknown. In sum, the communication scheme consists of encod-ing, GSA-based filtering, a chaotic receiver, and decoding.
The detailed description is given as follows. 4.2.1. Encoding
In the encoding step, the useful signal s ( t ) is encoded as a continuous-time carrier signal with N periods through the parameter a ( t ) in the unified chaotic system. Consider the following encoding procedure for a ( t ) A [0,1],  X  t  X  X  nNT r t o  X  n  X  1  X  NT , for n  X  0, 1, 2, y . 4.2.2.

The demodulation procedure for retrieving a ( t ) is given by (21). However, due to the channel noise o ( t ), the chaotic x system (24): _ y  X  u ^ x 1 ^ x 2 ^ x modeling. 4.2.4. Decoding
The decoding scheme is designed to estimate the useful signal, according to Eq. (23). If the difference between the decoding method is carried out as in system (25): ^ s  X  t  X  X  where n  X  0, 1, 2, y . 5.

Simulation results of chaotic secure communication scheme
A series of digital sequences s ( t )  X  {010000011111011010 are employed to verify the efficiency of the proposed commu-nication system. The simulations are computed in the MATLAB initial chaotic states are set to x 1 (0)  X  x 2 (0)  X  x 3 to 100, and N  X  2 for the simulations.

To further confirm the effectiveness of our communication scheme in the presence of noise, we also compute the dependence that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than the other schemes. When the unified chaotic system is used, a significant improvement in BER is possible. 5.2.

Conclusions
A new chaotic secure communication scheme based on GSA chaotic encoding-modulation approach, a digital sequence can be ing, a chaotic receiver, and a decoder. The security of this communication system is much enhanced by the unpredictable characteristics of the chaotic system and the unknown encoding-modulation scheme. The resistance to noise is strengthened by chaotic maps verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed secure communication scheme.
