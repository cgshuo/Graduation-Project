 In order to help users to find relevant in formation in Internet accurately and quickly, Text Categorization (TC) might be desirable to automatically classify web pages according to their topics and to show them in a category interface [1]. A wide range of statistical classification and machine learning techniques [2, 3, 4] have been applied to TC, including Rocchio classifiers, nearest neig hbor classifiers, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, support vector machines (SVMs), and so on. According to the research [3, 5, 6] comparing the performance of these techniques, the k -nearest neighbor (kNN) clas-sifier is a learning method that is simple to implement, easy to scale up, relative robust and has good performance. In this paper, a modified kNN classifier is applied to clas-sify the web pages of specific domain into a hierarchical topic structure. 
Compared to the traditional text categorization, text categorization for do-main-specific web pages poses new research challenges because of the diversity and noisy nature of the web pages[2] and the fine and complex category structure. A dic-tionary is constructed to represent the domain knowledge that can be used to intensify the domain concept in the pages, and a new text categorization approach based on the dictionary is proposed to attempt to classify the domain-specific web pages more efficiently. Amounts of Chinese web pages in Internet include English or other language words. For the hybrid multilingual web pages, it is essential to recognize the different language characters and extract the information accurately from the pages with diverse language encoding schemes. An automatic encoding detection and integration method is applied in the dictionary-based text categorization method to extract Chinese and English text information precisely from the hybrid bilingual Chinese-English pages. effective performance [5, 6]. Before classification, Feature extraction should be done to used in the classifier. In this paper, both training and test documents are converted from the original format to the final vectors through the following steps. First, useless tags and stop words [7] are removed from the documents and word stemming is performed using the Porter stemmer. Then, term weights are computed [7] to represent the documents as term vectors. Since not every document contains all terms, the feature vector space is usually very large and sparse. Both feature selection and re-parameterization [8] are performed to reduce the original feature dimensionality. 
Based on the vector space, kNN classifier is used to perform the multi-label classification. Given an test document, the kNN classifier ranks its nearest neighbours among training documents according to the corresponding cosine value, and uses the category weights over the k nearest neighbours are used for category ranking. Those categories with a rank score higher than a threshold value are finally assigned to the test. In spite of the fact that many Internet standard protocols designate Unicode as the default encoding, there still exist many encoding schemes on the Internet for a variety of reasons [9]. Without the right encoding information, the web pages are sometimes regarded as  X  X arbage X  or  X  X nreadable X  text during feature extraction by the classifier. To extract the features more exactly from the bilingual Chinese-English web pages, an automatic encoding detection and integration method is proposed to get the encodings of the different pages and integrate multiple encodings into a uniform encoding. 
Compared with English characters, it is tougher to recognize Chinese characters because the commonly used encodings, such as GB2312, Big5 and UTF-8, have different code-point ranges for them. To detect the language encoding of web pages, we try to get the encoding by extracting the charset information from the Meta HTML tags of the input pages. For the pages without explicit charset declaration, we apply a Character Distribution Method [9], which identifies the encoding based on the code point distribution statistics in the pages. Since different encoding schemes may have uniform encoding to make the pages with different encodings but same meaning have the same represented vector in the classifier. In this paper, we use GB2312 as the uniform encoding. GB2312 covers both the English and commonly used Chinese characters and it is easy to separate the bi-byte Chinese characters and single-byte English characters. After encoding detection and integration, all the Chinese-English pages with different encodings are integrated and can be represented accurately in the classifier. 
For the domain-specific web pages, the semantic similarity between them brings more difficulties when retrieving the k nearest neighbors by identifying the differences among the documents to rank them, which makes the kNN classifier perform poor as the following experiments show. This motivates us to build a domain-related dictionary to represent the domain knowledge which could be helpful to extract the domain information more exactly from the web pages. Then based on the dictionary, a new text categorization approach is proposed. 
In order to classify the chemical web pages more accurately in this paper, a machine-readable chemistry dictionary (ChemDict) is built. ChemDict has total 172,786 Chinese terms and 173,895 English terms. ChemDict includes large amounts of phrase Chinese and English terms consisting of more than one word. Longest substring matching algorithm is adopted to match the dictionary terms. Then these matched terms are inserted into the documents where they appear when indexing to intensify the chemical concepts and improve the semantic presentation. 
In the dictionary-based multilingual text categorization system, encoding detection and integration described is first performed on the web pages, and then longest substring matching algorithm is run to extract dictionary terms for document expansion. After that, feature extraction as presented in section 2 is performed to terms and 1,068 Chinese terms and the stemming step is ignored for Chinese terms. Based on the training vector space, the kNN classifier finds the k nearest neighbors of the test document, and the relevant categories of the test are finally obtained. This section describes the experiments for comparing the dictionary-based multilingual text categorization approach with the traditional method in detail. Results are also provided and discussed. 
To test the text categorization method on the real domain-related web pages, we constructed a labeled dataset from the chemical resources collected by ChIN [10] editors. ChIN is a comprehensive Chinese-English chemistry resource directory and uses a hierarchical chemical categorization scheme adopted by Natural Science categories. Each chemical resource in ChIN is manually classified into one or more ChIN-Page dataset. This dataset includes both Chinese and English chemical web pages collected based on the ChIN resource links from the Internet by a real-time crawler. 
To compare the text categorization performance on the chemical web pages with that on the normal documents, we also use the popular Reuters-21578 [11] collection as the second dataset. 
The category distributions in the datasets are shown in Table 1. Close observation will find that the datasets are all uneven or skewed multi-label datasets, while the category complexity and the number of categories per document of ChIN-Page are much larger than Reuters. Consequently, the categorization is more difficult to learn as the following experimental results show. Table 2 shows the document distributions in the datasets, where Reuters use the  X  X odApte X  split [11] and ChIN-Page dataset is split according to the ChIN indexed date of each page. The documents that are unlabeled or have no text besides the tags are removed from both datasets. The distributions of Chinese documents in Chin-Page are put in parentheses. 
For evaluating the average performance of a classifier over multiple categories, we followed the traditional macro-averaging and micro-averaging method [6]. Micro-averaged scores tend to be dominated by the performance of the system on common categories, while macro-averaged scores tend to be dominated by the performance on rare categories if the majority of categories in the task are rare [2]. For the uneven category distributions (Table 1.) in our tasks, providing both types of evaluation scores gives a clearer picture than considering either type alone. In the following experiments, the micro-averaged F 1 and macro-averaged F 1 are used to evaluate the classifier average performance. 
It is obvious that the classification performance is highly dependent on the dataset used. In the experiments, we first test the traditional text categorization method on the Reuters and the chemistry-related ChIN-Page dataset. Then the proposed diction-ary-based multilingual text categorization approach is used to observe its effect on classification performance. 4.1 Effect of Dataset on Classification Performance The traditional text categorization method described in section 2 is separately per-formed on the Reuters and ChIN-Page dataset. To show the effect of the category structure on the classification performance, we also classify the ChIN-Page web pages using different categorization schemes, that is only using the top-level categories (1-level), the top and the second level categories (1.2-level) and all the categories listed in the Table 3, where bold font marks the best performance of each column. The second column shows the actual total categ ory number that the test documents are assigned in the experiments. For the top level categorization scheme of ChIN-Page, the performance of 10 most frequent categories is substituted by that of all the 7 categories. 
The column-wise comparison in Table 3 shows that the performances on Reuters are often much better than that on ChIN-Page for Reuters has fewer noisy data and coarser classification scheme than ChIN-Page, while the macro-averaged F 1 of all the catego-ries on Reuters is worse than that on ChIN-Page with the top-level scheme because Reuters has more and skewed category distributions. For the ChIN-Page, the more fine and complex categorization scheme induces the more inferior performance. From the row-wise comparison in Table 3, we can observe that the macro-averaged F each dataset. The results also show that the averaged performances on the 10 most frequent categories are always superior to that on all the categories. 4.2 Effect of Dictionary-Based Multilingual Text Categorization on The dictionary-based multilingual text categorization approach described in section 3 is performed on ChIN-Page with the 3-level hierarchical category structure to extract the chemistry information more exactly. The encoding detection and integration method effect. The results are shown in Table 4, where the second column shows the feature number in the training documents after feature extraction. 
From the results, we can see that the proposed encoding detection and integration method can extract precise and uniform Chinese features from web pages, and can improve the classification performance. We can also find that the dictionary-based multilingual text categorization approach can further improve the micro-averaging performance while not notably influence the macro-averaging performance. The reason may be that the classifier can X  X  extract enou gh chemical terms to properly classify the test documents in the small categories that have scarce training documents. 
From the performance comparison of the dictionary-based multilingual text cate-gorization with the traditional method, we can observe that the proposed approach can notably improve the classification performance on the ChIN-Page web pages. For the micro-averaged F 1 on all the categories, we can obtain about 11% improvement over the traditional method. Text Categorization for domain-specific web pages poses new research challenges for the noisy and diverse nature of the pages and the fine and complex category structure of the specific domain. The proposed dictionary-based multilingual text categorization approach in this paper can effectively improve the categorization performance on the real chemistry-related web pages in the ChIN-Page dataset. 
Future research is needed on the issues, such as strategy optimization of expanding a document by matched dictionary terms and utilizing the hyperlink and other web page characteristics to improve the classification performance for domain-specific web pages.
