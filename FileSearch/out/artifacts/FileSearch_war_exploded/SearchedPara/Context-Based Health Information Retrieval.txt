Typically, Information Retrieval (IR) systems support their decisions solely on the query and document collection. Sev-eral implicit factors about the user and the search context are ignored and may have the potential to optimize IR per-formance. A contextualised strategy might allow IR systems to learn and predict what information a searcher needs, learn how and when information should be displayed, present re-sults relating them to previous information and to the tasks the user has been engaged in and decide who else should get the new information.

This is very clear in the health domain where the search context is extremely rich. According to Lin et al. [4],  X  X he domain of clinical medicine is very well-suited for experi-ments in building richer models of the information seeking process X . Here, the search process usually occurs in well-defined scenarios (e.g.  X  X reatment X ,  X  X iagnosis X ) whose fea-tures may be used to improve IR systems. Other examples of contextual features are those derived from the personal health record, clinical case at hand and searcher X  X  expertise in the health domain. Context may be useful, for exam-ple, to deal with the problem of specialized medical terms that are commonly misspelled or incomplete in search en-gines X  queries [5] or even to help assess the quality of health information -another commonly mentioned problem [2].
The growing importance of Health Information Retrieval (HIR) nowadays and the rising significance of context in IR stimulate this research. Our main goal is to study contextual features surrounding HIR, their effect on the use and effec-tiveness of IR systems. The research will be focused on three components of the retrieval system: user interface, query op-erations and ranking. These components show potential for improvement through the use of contextual information and can be explored modularly.

The proposed methodology includes several steps. In an initial stage, a health information seeking behavior study will be conducted to identify relevant context attributes
