 When composing a text, a writer can access a the-saurus to retrieve words that are similar to a given target word, when there is a need to avoid repeating the same word, or when the word does not seem to be the best choice in the context.

Our intelligent thesaurus is an interactive appli-cation that presents the user with a list of alterna-tive words (near-synonyms), and, unlike standard thesauri, it orders the choices by their suitability to the writing context. We investigate how the collo-cational properties of near-synonyms can help with choosing the best words. This problem is difficult because the near-synonyms have senses that are very close to each other, and therefore they occur in sim-ilar contexts; we need to capture the subtle differ-ences specific to each near-synonym.

Our thesaurus brings up only alternatives that have the same part-of-speech with the target word. The choices could come from various inventories of near-synonyms or similar words, for example the Roget thesaurus (Roget, 1852), dictionaries of syn-onyms (Hayakawa, 1994), or clusters acquired from corpora (Lin, 1998).

In this paper we focus on the task of automat-ically selecting the best near-synonym that should be used in a particular context. The natural way to validate an algorithm for this task would be to ask human readers to evaluate the quality of the algo-rithm X  X  output, but this kind of evaluation would be very laborious. Instead, we validate the algorithms by deleting selected words from sample sentences, to see whether the algorithms can restore the miss-ing words. That is, we create a lexical gap and eval-uate the ability of the algorithms to fill the gap . Two examples are presented in Figure 1. All the near-synonyms of the original word, including the word itself, become the choices in the solution set (see the figure for two examples of solution sets). The task is to automatically fill the gap with the best choice in the particular context. We present a method of scor-ing the choices. The highest scoring near-synonym will be chosen. In order to evaluate how well our method works we consider that the only correct so-lution is the original word. This will cause our eval-uation scores to underestimate the performance, as more than one choice will sometimes be a perfect Figure 1: Examples of sentences with a lexical gap, and candidate near-synonyms to fill the gap. solution. Moreover, what we consider to be the best choice is the typical usage in the corpus, but it may vary from writer to writer. Nonetheless, it is a con-venient way of producing test data.

The statistical method that we propose here is based on semantic coherence scores (based on mu-tual information) of each candidate with the words in the context. We explore how far such a method can go when using the Web as a corpus. We estimate the counts by using the Waterloo MultiText 1 system (Clarke and Terra, 2003b) with a corpus of about one terabyte of text collected by a Web crawler. We also propose a method that uses collocations and anti-collocations, and a supervised method that uses words and mutual information scores as featured for machine learning. The idea of using the Web as a corpus of texts has been exploited by many researchers. Grefen-stette (1999) used the Web for example-based ma-chine translation; Kilgarriff (2001) investigated the type of noise in Web data; Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and Agirre and Martinez (2000) used it as an additional resource for word sense disambiguation; Resnik (1999) mined the Web for bilingual texts; Turney (2001) used Web frequency counts to com-pute information retrieval-based mutual-information scores. In a Computational Linguistics special issue on the Web as a corpus (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003), Keller and Lapata (2003) show that Web counts correlate well with counts collected from a balanced corpus: the size of the Web compensates for the noise in the data. In this paper we are using a very large corpus of Web pages to address a problem that has not been successfully solved before.
In fact, the only work that addresses exactly the same task is that of Edmonds (1997), as far as we are aware. Edmonds gives a solution based on a lexical co-occurrence network that included second-order co-occurrences. We use a much larger corpus and a simpler method, and we obtain much better results.

Our task has similarities to the word sense disam-biguation task. Our near-synonyms have senses that are very close to each other. In Senseval, some of the fine-grained senses are also close to each other, so they might occur in similar contexts, while the coarse-grained senses are expected to occur in dis-tinct contexts. In our case, the near-synonyms are different words to choose from, not the same word with different senses. Our method computes a score for each candidate near-synonym that could fill in the gap. The near-synonym with the highest score is the proposed so-lution. The score for each candidate reflects how well a near-synonym fits in with the context. It is based on the mutual information scores between a near-synonym and the content words in the context (we filter out the stopwords).

The pointwise mutual information (PMI) be-tween two words x and y compares the probabil-ity of observing the two words together (their joint probability) to the probabilities of observing x and y independently (the probability of occurring together by chance) (Church and Hanks, 1991): PMI ( x,y ) = The probabilities can be approximated by: P ( x ) = C ( x ) /N , P ( y ) = C ( y ) /N , P ( x,y ) = C ( x,y ) /N , where C denotes frequency counts and N is the total number of words in the corpus. There-ignored in comparisons.

We model the context as a window of size 2 k around the gap (the missing word): k words to the left and k words to the right of the gap. If the sen-tence is s =  X  X  X  w 1  X  X  X  w k Gap w k +1  X  X  X  w 2 k  X  X  X  , for each near-synonym NS i from the group of can-didates, the semantic coherence score is computed by the following formula: Score ( NS i ,s ) =  X  k j =1 PMI ( NS i ,w j ) +
We also experimented with the same formula when the sum is replaced with maximum to see whether a particular word in the context has higher influence than the sum of all contributions (though the sum worked better).

Because we are using the Waterloo terabyte cor-pus and we issue queries to its search engine, we have several possibilities of computing the fre-quency counts. C ( x,y ) can be the number of co-occurrences of x and y when y immediately follows x , or the distance between x and y can be up to q . We call q the query frame size. The tool for access-ing the corpus allows us to use various values for q .
The search engine also allows us to approxi-mate words counts with document counts. If the counts C ( x ) , C ( y ) , and C ( x,y ) are approximated as the number of document in which they appear, we obtain the PMI-IR formula (Turney, 2001). The queries we need to send to the search engine are the same but they are restricted to document counts: C ( x ) is the number of document in which x occurs; C ( x,y ) is the number of documents in which x is followed by y in a frame of size q .

Other statistical association measures, such as log-likelihood, could be used. We tried only PMI because it is easy to compute on a Web corpus and because PMI performed better than other measures in (Clarke and Terra, 2003a).

We present the results in Section 6.1, where we compare our method to a baseline algorithm that al-ways chooses the most frequent near-synonyms and to Edmonds X  X  method for the same task, on the same data set. First, however, we present two other meth-ods to which we compare our results. For the task of near-synonym choice, another method that we implemented is the anti-collocations method. By anti-collocation we mean a combina-Table 1: Examples of collocations and anti-collocations. The  X  indicates the anti-collocations. tion of words that a native speaker would not use and therefore should not be used when automatically generating text. This method uses a knowledge-base of collocational behavior of near-synonyms ac-quired in previous work (Inkpen and Hirst, 2006). A fragment of the knowledge-base is presented in Ta-ble 1, for the near-synonyms of the word error and two collocate words ghastly and spelling . The lines marked by  X  represent anti-collocations and the rest represent strong collocations.

The anti-collocations method simply ranks the strong collocations higher than the anti-collocations. In case of ties it chooses the most frequent near-synonym. In Section 6.2 we present the results of comparing this method to the method from the pre-vious section. We can also apply supervised learning techniques to our task. It is easy to obtain labeled training data, the same way we collected test data for the two un-supervised methods presented above. We train clas-sifiers for each group of near-synonyms. The classes are the near-synonyms in the solution set. The word that produced the gap is the expected solution, the class label; this is a convenient way of producing training data, no need for manual annotation. Each sentence is converted into a vector of features to be used for training the supervised classifiers. We used two types of features. The features of the first type are the PMI scores of the left and right context with each class (each near-synonym from the group). The number of features of this type is twice the number of classes, one score for the part of the sentence at the left of the gap, and one for the part at the right of the gap. The features of the second type are the
Table 2: The near-synonym groups used in Exp1. words in the context window. For each group of near-synonyms, we used as features the 500 most-frequent words situated close to the gaps in a devel-opment set. The value of a word feature for each training example is 1 if the word is present in the sentence (at the left or at the right of the gap), and 0 otherwise. We trained classifiers using several ma-chine learning algorithms, to see which one is best at discriminating among the near-synonyms. In Sec-tion 6.3, we present the results of several classifiers.
A disadvantage of the supervised method is that it requires training for each group of near-synonyms. Additional training would be required whenever we add more near-synonyms to our knowledge-base. 6.1 Comparison to Edmonds X  X  method In this section we present results of the statistical method explained in Section 3. We compare our results with those of Edmonds X  X  (1997), whose so-lution used the texts from the year 1989 of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to build a lexical co-occurrence network for each of the seven groups of near-synonyms from Table 2. The network in-cluded second-order co-occurrences. Edmonds used the WSJ 1987 texts for testing, and reported accura-cies only a little higher than the baseline. The near-synonyms in the seven groups were chosen to have low polysemy. This means that some sentences with wrong senses of near-synonyms might be in the
For comparison purposes, in this section we use the same test data (WSJ 1987) and the same groups of near-synonyms (we call these sentences the Exp1 data set). Our method is based on mutual informa-tion, not on co-occurrence counts. Our counts are collected from a much larger corpus.

Table 3 presents the comparative results for the seven groups of near-synonyms (we did not repeat Table 3: Comparison between the statistical method from Section 3, baseline algorithm, and Edmonds X  X  method (Exp1 data set). them in the first column of the table, only the num-ber of the group.). The last row averages the ac-curacies for all the test sentences. The second col-umn shows how many test sentences we collected for each near-synonym group. The third column is for the baseline algorithm that always chooses the most frequent near-synonym. The fourth column presents the results reported in (Edmonds, 1997). column show the results of the supervised learning classifier described in Section 5. The fifth column presents the result of our method when using doc-ument counts in PMI-IR, and the last column is for the same method when using word counts in PMI. We show in bold the best accuracy for each data set. We notice that the automatic choice is more difficult for some near-synonym groups than for the others. In this paper, by accuracy we mean the number of correct choices made by each method (the number of gaps that were correctly filled). The correct choice is the near-synonym that was initially replaced by the gap in the test sentence.

To fine-tune our statistical method, we used the data set for the near-synonyms of the word difficult collected from the WSJ 1989 corpus as a develop-ment set. We varied the context window size k and the query frame q , and determined good values for the parameter k and q . The best results were ob-tained for small window sizes, k = 1 and k = 2 (meaning k words to the left and k words to the right of the gap). For each k , we varied the query frame size q . The results are best for a relatively small query frame, q = 3 , 4 , 5 , when the query frame is the same or slightly larger then the context window. The results are worse for a very small query frame, q = 1 , 2 and for larger query frames q = 6 , 7 ,..., 20 or unlimited. The results presented in the rest of the paper are for k = 2 and q = 5 . For all the other data sets used in this paper (from WSJ 1987 and BNC) we use the parameter values as determined on the development set.

Table 3 shows that the performance is generally better for word counts than for document counts. Therefore, we prefer the method that uses word counts (which is also faster in our particular set-ting). The difference between them is not statis-tically significant. Our statistical method performs significantly better than both Edmond X  X  method and the baseline algorithm. For all the results presented in this paper, statistical significance tests were done using the paired t -test, as described in (Manning and Sch  X  utze, 1999), page 209.

On average, our method performs 22 percentage points better than the baseline algorithm, and 10 percentage points better than Edmonds X  X  method. Its performance is similar to that of the supervised method (see Section 6.3). An important advan-tage of our method is that it works on any group of near-synonyms without training, whereas Ed-monds X  X  method required a lexical co-occurrence network to be built in advance for each group of near-synonyms and the supervised method required training for each near-synonym group.

We note that the occasional presence of near-synonyms with other senses than the ones we need might make the task somewhat easier. Nonetheless, the task is still difficult, even for human judges, as we will see in Section 6.4. On the other hand, be-cause the solution allows only one correct answer the accuracies are underestimated. 6.2 Comparison to the anti-collocations In a second experiment we compare the results of our methods with the anti-collocation method de-scribed in Section 4. We use the data set from our previous work, which contain sentences from the first half of the British National Corpus, with near-synonyms from the eleven groups from Table 4.
The number of near-synonyms in each group is higher compared with WordNet synonyms, because they are taken from (Hayakawa, 1994), a dictionary
Table 4: The near-synonym groups used in Exp2. that explains differences between near-synonyms. Moreover we retain only the sentences in which at least one of the context words is in our previously acquired knowledge-base of near-synonym colloca-tions. That is, the anti-collocations method works only if we know how a word in the context collo-cates with the near-synonyms from a group. For the sentences that do not contain collocations or anti-collocations, it will perform no better than the base-line, because the information needed by the method is not available in the knowledge-base. Even if we increase the coverage of the knowledge-base, the anti-collocation method might still fail too often due to words that were not included.

Table 5 presents the results of the comparison. We used two data sets: TestSample, which includes at most two sentences per collocation (the first two sen-tences from the corpus); and TestAll, which includes all the sentences with collocations as they occurred in the corpus. The reason we chose these two tests is not to bias the results due to frequent collocations.
The last two columns are the accuracies achieved by our method. The second last column shows the results of the method when the word counts are ap-proximated with document counts. The improve-ment over the baseline is 16 to 27 percentage points. The improvement over the anti-collocations method is 10 to 17 percentage points. 6.3 Comparison to supervised learning We present the results of the supervised method from Section 5 on the data sets used in Section 6.1. Table 5: Comparison between the statistical method from Section 3 and the anti-collocations method from Section 4. (Exp2 data set from Section 6.2). Table 6: Comparative results for the supervised learning method using various ML learning algo-rithms (Weka), averaged over the seven groups of near-synonyms from the Exp1 data set.
 As explained before, the data sets contain sentences with a lexical gap. For each of the seven groups of near-synonyms, the class to choose from, in or-der to fill in the gaps is one of the near-synonyms in each cluster. We implemented classifiers that use as features either the PMI scores of the left and right context with each class, or the words in the con-text windows, or both types of features combined. We used as features the 500 most-frequent words for each group of near-synonyms. We report accuracies for 10-fold cross-validation.

Table 6 presents the results, averaged for the seven groups of near-synonyms, of several classifiers from the Weka package (Witten and Frank, 2000). The classifiers that use PMI features are Decision Trees, Decision Rules, Na  X   X ve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Kernel Density, and Boosting a weak classifier (De-cision Stumps  X  which are shallow decision trees). Then, a Na  X   X ve Bayes classifier that uses only the word features is presented, and the same type of classifiers with both types of features. The other classifiers from the Weka package were also tried, but the results did not improve and these algorithms Table 7: Comparison between the unsupervised sta-tistical method from Section 3 and the supervised method described in Section 5, on the Exp1 data set. had difficulties in scaling up. In particular, when using the 500 word features for each training exam-ple, only the Na  X   X ve Bayes algorithm was able to run in reasonable time. We noticed that the Na  X   X ve Bayes classifier performs very poorly on PMI features only (55% average accuracy), but performs very well on word features (68% average accuracy). In contrast, the Decision Tree classifier performs well on PMI features, especially when using boosting with Deci-sion Stumps. When using both the PMI scores and the word features, the results are slightly higher. It seems that both types of features are sufficient for training a good classifier, but combining them adds value.

Table 7 presents the detailed results of two of the supervised classifiers, and repeats, for easier com-parison, the results of the unsupervised statistical method from Section 6.1. The supervised classifier that uses only PMI scores performs similar to the un-supervised method. The best supervised classifier, that uses both types of features, performs slightly better than the unsupervised statistical method, but the difference is not statistically significant. We con-clude that the results of the supervised methods and the unsupervised statistical method are similar. An important advantage of the unsupervised method is that it works on any group of near-synonyms without training. 6.4 Results obtained by human judges We asked two human judges, native speakers of En-glish, to guess the missing word in a random sample of the Exp1 data set (50 sentences for each of the Table 8: Results obtained by two human judges on a random subset of the Exp1 data set. 7 groups of near-synonyms, 350 sentences in total). The judges were instructed to choose words from the list of near-synonyms. The choice of a word not in the list was allowed, but not used by the two judges. The results in Table 8 show that the agreement be-tween the two judges is high (78.5%), but not per-fect. This means the task is difficult, even if some wrong senses in the test data might have made the task easier in a few cases.

The human judges were allowed to choose more than one correct answer when they were convinced that more than one near-synonym fits well in the context. They used this option sparingly, only in 5% of the 350 sentences. Taking the accuracy achieved of the human judges as an upper limit, the automatic method has room for improvement (10-15 percent-age points). In future work, we plan to allow the system to make more than one choice when appro-priate (for example when the second choice has a very close score to the first choice). Our experiments show that the accuracy of the first choice being the best choice is 66 to 75%; therefore there will be cases when the writer will not choose the first alternative. But the accuracy for the first two choices is quite high, around 90%, as presented in Table 9.

If the writer is in the process of writing and selects a word to be replaced with a near-synonym proposed by the thesaurus, then only the context on the left of the word can be used for ordering the alternatives. Our method can be easily adapted to consider only the context on the left of the gap. The results of this case are presented in Table 10, for the data sets Table 9: Accuracies for the first two choices as or-dered by an interactive intelligent thesaurus. Table 10: Results of the statistical method when only the left context is considered. used in the previous sections. The accuracy values are lower than in the case when both the left and the right context are considered (Table 9). This is due in part to the fact that some sentences in the test sets have very little left context, or no left context at all. On the other hand, many times the writer composes a sentence or paragraph and then she/he goes back to change a word that does not sound right. In this case, both the left and right context will be available.
In the intelligent thesaurus, we could combine the supervised and unsupervised method, by using a supervised classifier when the confidence in the classification is high, and by using the unsupervised method otherwise. Also the unsupervised statisti-cal method would be used for the groups of near-synonyms for which a supervised classifier was not previously trained. We presented a statistical method of choosing the best near-synonym in a context. We compared this method to a previous method (Edmonds X  X  method) and to the anti-collocation method and showed that the performance improved considerably. We also show that the unsupervised statistical method per-forms comparably to a supervised learning method.
Our method based on PMI scores performs well, despite the well-known limitations of PMI in cor-pora. PMI tends to have problems mostly on very small counts, but it works reasonably with larger counts. Our web corpus is quite large, therefore the problem of small counts does not appear.
In the intelligent thesaurus, we do not make the near-synonym choice automatically, but we let the user choose. The first choice offered by the the-saurus is the best one quite often; the first two choices are correct 90% of the time.

Future work includes a word sense disambigua-tion module. In case the target word selected by the writer has multiple senses, they could trigger sev-eral groups of near-synonyms. The system will de-cide which group represents the most likely senses by computing the semantic coherence scores aver-aged over the near-synonyms from each group.
We plan to explore the question of which inven-tory of near-synonyms or similar words is the most suitable for use in the intelligent thesaurus.
Choosing the right near-synonym in context is also useful in other applications, such as natural lan-guage generation (NLG) and machine translation. In fact we already used the near-synonym choice module in an NLG system, for complementing the choices made by using the symbolic knowledge in-corporated into the system.
