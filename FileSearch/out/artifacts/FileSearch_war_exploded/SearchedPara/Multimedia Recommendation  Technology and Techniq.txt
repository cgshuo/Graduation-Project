 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Performance, Theory Multimedia, Recommendation In recent years, we have witnessed a rapid growth in the avail-ability of digital multimedia on various application platforms and domains. Consequently, the problem of information overload has become more and more serious. In order to tackle the challenge, various multimedia recommendation technologies have been de-veloped by different research communities (e.g., multimedia sys-tems, information retrieval, machine learning and computer ver-sion). Meanwhile, many commercial web systems (e.g., Flick, YouTube, and Last.fm) have successfully applied recommendation techniques to provide users personalized content and services in a convenient and flexible way.

When looking back, the information retrieval (IR) community has a long history of studying and contributing recommender sys-tem design and related issues. It has been proven that the recom-mender systems can effectively assist users in handling information overload and provide high-quality personalization. While several courses were dedicated to multimedia retrieval in the recent decade, to the best of our knowledge, the tutorial is the first one specifically focusing on multimedia recommender systems and their applica-tions on various domains and media contents. We plan to summa-rize the research along this direction and provide an impetus for further research on this important topic.
