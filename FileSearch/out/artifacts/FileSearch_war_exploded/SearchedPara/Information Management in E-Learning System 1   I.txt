 Since the wide use of Internet, information and knowledge booms and people X  X  ways of learning have undertaken a revolutionary change. Electronic learning (e-learning) is increasingly accepted as a popular and economical learning method in education as well as professional development programs. A major characteristic of Internet is that plenty of heterogeneous systems coexist and various learning information and learn-ing systems are distributed everywhere. How to make full use of scattered information available and how to manage the information and implement interoperability between those learning systems become one of the major challenges. 
Interoperability can be defined as  X  X he ability of two or more systems or compo-nents to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged X  [1]. At present, e-learning information and systems have been applied in all kinds of education programs. Many educational institutions have developed learning systems and resources. Although Internet makes the information public and widespread, the format and content of information vary and the implementation technologies of plat-form are also different. Because of the lack of effective management and integration, it is very often the case that learning information can only be used in a specific plat-information. 
To satisfy the requirement of interoperability, the learning information (e.g. learn-ing content and learner X  X  information) is standardized for accessibility. The standard-diverse components of systems with their own functions can interoperate with each other. 
Web services provide a standard means of communication among different soft-ware applications, running on a variety of platforms and/or frameworks [2]. To solve the problem of interoperability between different learning systems, this paper pro-poses an approach to standardizing architecture of learning systems. The proposed architecture should be services-oriented and it should support China E-Learning Technology Standards (CELTS). [3] While developing e-learning, many countries have realized that the reusability of learning information and system interoperability has economic and practical signifi-cance. Works on e-learning information standardization in China began only a few years ago. In 2000, an e-learning technology standardization project started while China e-learning technology standardization committee (CELTSC) [3] was founded. The aim of the project is to develop e-learning standards to enable sharing of informa-tion and interoperability among heterogeneous learning systems. But still there are many independent systems and information resources which can not communicate and share with each other effectively. This causes plenty of unnecessary development. communicate with international e-learning systems. 
E-learning standardization could be divided into two levels, the first one is learning information standardization, and the second one is common software components and Chinese e-learning technology standards (CELTS), which include five categories: general standards, learning environment standards, learning resources standards, leaner information standards and learning management standards. This set of stan-dards provides data and information mode l. Standardized learning contents and learner information could be reused in different learning platform. 
In China, learning contents and systems are mainly developed by those nonprofit educational institutions and also small-scale enterprises. The developers are disper-sive and weakness of fund and technology. The main issue is that how to unite devel-opers and integrate each productions effectively. 
It is thus necessary to define an open architecture and specify its application inter-face so that software components can be shared among organizations. Learning sys-tems can be modularized and loosely coup led via shareable objects and interfaces. While importing new standard components, those existing systems don X  X  need to be overthrown and the modules of systems could be reused and interoperated. Standardization can enable the reusability and interoperability of e-learning informa-tion which consists of information on the contents, learners as well as those on track-ing the learning process. 3.1 Learning Content Standardization For learning content management, one of the basic principles is the separation of ing contents should be broken down into chunks. From a pedagogical perspective, each chunk might play a specific role within an instructional design methodology. Such chunks are called learning objects, which are the basic components of the courseware [5]. Learning objects are composed of some assets which could be texts, images, sounds and any contents that can be present to learners. To describe learning objects, we could use metadata. Metadata is a kind of data which is used to describe data and it provides a means to describe the information of learning objects. We can find, locate and exchange learning objects via metadata. Standards about metadata of learning objects define a set of attributes on learning objects, such as title, key words, format, size, classification etc. The CELTS-3 (China E-Learning Technology Stan-dards),  X  X pecification for Learning Object Metadata X  [6], has been developed and widely adopted in China. Different formats of learning content can be packaged with the addition of metadata information. A standardized package can then be used in any learning systems. 3.2 Learner Information Standardization Learners are the core of learning activity and they play an important role in e-learning. The purpose of building standardized learner information model is to unify the management of students and courses. In the domain of e-learning, learner infor-mation includes some specific attributes besides basic personal information, such as used to describe competency. The term  X  X ompetency X  is very extensive, which in-cludes knowledge, task, result etc. The standardized information could be exchanged between different systems via XML binding. 3.3 Learning Process Information Management Learning process can be broken down into several unattached sub processes which should be arranged in a sequence. For example, the order of disposing homework, handing in homework and correct homework can not be reversed. And the whole process should be tracked and noted down by a system which is called Learning Man-agement System (LMS). The CELTS-20, X  X pecification for learning management system (LMS) X  [7] gives a principle of achieving interoperability between LMS. It includes how to manage learning activity, how to evaluate a course and how to access a course in different LMS. However, the implementation of LMS in e-learning is still in its infant stage. 3.4 The Advantage and Importance of Standardization For the management of those scattered information and distributed systems, stan-dardization solves the major problem. Fig.1 ill ustrates the standardization of learning structure of this package. Learner information is defined in a domain model. And standardization regulates the scope of domain. So the attributes of information are limited, which means the problem space is limited. To manage the numerous and complicated information effectively, using standard metadata is almost the only method. Just like network protocol, standardized contents and information are the common language for learning systems and they are the bases of communication between heterogeneous learning systems. 4.1 The Second Level of Standardization Learning information standardization is the first level to implement the interoperabil-ity between heterogeneous learning systems. Although different learning systems may be implemented in different technologies and may run on different operating systems, their functions of modules are similar such as virtual classroom, chatting room, elec-tronic blackboard, and so on. Such time consuming work have to be repeated in de-veloping every system. To reuse modules in different systems, we must standardize the system architecture. This is the second level of standardization and only standard-ized information could be retrieved easily in such architecture. 
Many international standardization organizations have done some researches in this field. OKI [8] has produced a series of Open Service Interface Definitions (OSIDs) to specify composition of learning systems. All modules designed with this specification can interoperate, which means an existing and well-defined module can plug and play instead of developing a new module for the same function. Thus the system will become more flexible. 4.2 Web Services and S ervices-Oriented Architecture Web Services are a set of standards for describing, publishing, discovering and bind-ing application interfaces which include WSDL (Web Services Description Lan-guage), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), UDDI (Universal Description, Dis-covery and Integration). WSDL is a format for describing a Web Services interface. It is to describe services and a way they should be bound to specific network addresses. The descriptions of services and messages are generally expressed in XML (eXtended Markup Language). SOAP provides the envelope for sending the messages over services providers. Fig.2 illustrates the elements of Web Services. 
SOA (Services-Orientated Architecture) is a kind of methodology in software en-gineering and it is used to describe distributed resources in heterogeneous network of services. Services can communicate with each other involving simple data trans-portation and coordinating activity in several services. Although SOA is technology independent, Web Services is still the most suitable implementing technology avail-able for SOA nowadays. 4.3 Why SOA? Firstly, e-learning is a distributed learning pattern based on Internet and such an envi-ronment is what SOA intends to describe. Secondly, to solve the problem of the inter-operability between heterogeneous learning systems, a services-oriented design pat-tern is the most direct and common way. And thirdly, a characteristic of standardiza-tion is technology independent, while in a services-based system, services interface is transparent for consumers. We define the interface of operation on those standardized information and any implementation compliant to interface specification could be reused in systems. Although the pace of technological development is rapid, such architecture will remain steady within 5 to 10 years X  time. In this way, SOA can keep pace with new technology and make the system extensible. 4.4 The Design of E-Learning System Architecture -Open Education Service In our e-learning system architecture, modules are grouped into layers from top to bottom. Common function modules can be identified and summarized from existing e-Educational Services. Between Educational Services Layer and Infrastructure Layer, a Common Services Layer accessing infrastructure, like database and network communi-cation, provides standardized information for upper layer. Thus in Educational Services Education Service Architecture. 
Fig.4 takes an assignment submission as an example and we can see how services passed to a logging and tracking service. At the same time, the assignment will be trans-ported to a services broker that is used to manage and schedule services. The broker gets noted down by the logging and tracking service, and then the status of learner X  X  assign-ments will be modified. 
The learning system is composed of many services with specific function and the learning process can be represented as co llaboration of relative services. Services communicate via standardized information whatever their implementations and envi-ronments are. This architecture achieves interoperability between heterogeneous learning systems. 4.5 Features of the Architecture Open. The architecture and interfaces should be open.  X  X pen X  doesn X  X  only mean open source, but also mean  X  X nite X  instead of  X  X ompete X  for merchants. Under such architecture, developers can work in familiar fields and implement their specific interface. Many common and well-developed modules can be reused. Then the application will grow faster and faster. Loose Coupling and Distributed. Systems are scattered in the architecture and services are distributed. Every module is developed and debugged individually, and then they are integrated into a learning system seamlessly. While the implementation and system environment of services changed, the variation could be unknowable for other services in the system so long as the interface specification is the same. can be changed, which is called re-factory. This brings us great flexibility for system development and maintenance. Fig.5 is an example of re-factory. Besides the assign-ment submission application, an assignmen t check application is required for teach-ers. This application is composed of four services, three of which are used in assign-ment submission. Teachers need to download the assignment that students submit, so a new download service is added. We only develop the new service and build the new application. That means we choose what we need but not develop all of them. And the principle of re-factory  X  not break down primary function and build new application. Standards Support and Interoperability for Information Exchange. This architecture should support CELTS. Following CELTS, a standardized information model is defined. Learning contents and learner information can be exchanged between various application and platform. Modules in different system can communicate with each other. In another word, the components which were developed in one platform can be used in another platform. 4.6 An Implementation We have implemented a Learning Content Management System (LCMS) based on the above architecture. According to the architecture we divided the services into two layers: common services and educational services. In common services layer, file operation and database operation (RDB and XML DB) are implemented. And in edu-cational services layer, we have services for learning object management, courseware management, courseware generation and learning resource publication. This Learning Content Management System has been used in our  X  X ++ programming X  course, to assist teacher to management learning object such as examples and video courseware. This LCMS can also be an optional additional module for the University e-learning platform  X  X singhua Web School X . In figure 6, the different components and their specific functions will be described. To achieve the interoperability between heterogeneous learning systems, standard metadata has been used to describe a uniform content and information model. Further more, the architecture and interface specification of exchanging information need to be defined. Web services technology can satisfy such a requirement. In this paper, we propose a services-oriented Open Education Service Architecture which classifies educational application modules into four layers and supports CELTS. 
Further research will work on enriching the architecture with more service and fa-cilitating the application of it with the joint effort of merchants and institutes.
