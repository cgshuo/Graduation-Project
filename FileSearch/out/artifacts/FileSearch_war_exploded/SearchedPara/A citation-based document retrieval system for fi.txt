Clustering Techniques  X  This component uses various clustering methods (such as document clustering and author clustering) to mine the citation database.

In addition to the original PubSearch components, two major components have been developed for the new enhanced citation-based document retrieval system. These are: tiple sets of clustering results.

To support citation-based retrieval, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) has been performed on the Scholarly Citation Database to generate the following clusters:

 Author clusters  X  generated based on author co-citation analysis.

 clusters. In this paper, we focus on finding expertise in research areas. 4.2. Finding expertise in research areas research area. It is also very useful for identifying speakers for invited talks and seminars.
Research on finding expertise has attracted much interest from the academic community. Most systems developed so far have been based on social and collaborative aspects of making expertise recommendations
Recently, data mining techniques have been used for finding experts. These include keyword-based mining technique is only applicable to finding expertise within an organization or small domain area. Another are related to query keywords. However, CiteSeer does not provide information on researchers who work in Hui, 2002; He et al., 2002 ) system to provide author cluster search.

In this research, we propose an approach that combines document clustering and author clustering for finding experts in research areas from a citation database using the CCA technique. With our proposed follows. 4.2.1. Keyword-Author Cross-Clustering Context Generation is already illustrated as Table A.III . 4.2.2. Finding expertise process Input, Identifying Researchers and Retrieving Researcher X  X  Information, Ranking of Researchers and Visualization.

Identifying Related Researchers : In the Keyword-Author Cross-Clustering Context, relations between key-word clusters and author clusters are stored. Each keyword cluster corresponds to a set of keywords and each author cluster corresponds to a set of authors X  names. Hence, the set of keywords and the set of authors X  names can be generated from a keyword-author relation. Each set of keywords represents a research area and each set of authors represents a group of researchers. Theoretically, if a group of researchers has a relation with a research area, then they work in the research area. Thus, relations in the Keyword-Author Cross-Clustering Context can be used to derive the research areas of researchers or experts.

Ranking Expert : The identified researchers are ranked using the citation information. They are ranked mation available in the Citation Database. Scores are calculated and the researchers are ranked accord-ingly. Researchers with high scores are regarded as experts .

Retrieving Expert X  X  Information : To provide information on researchers, the Researchers Database is con-structed. The Researchers Database stores information on researchers such as their contact information, home page, email address, etc. Such information can be extracted from the Web using an intelligent agent. Experts information is stored in the Experts Database .

Expert Retrieval : The experts and expertise information can be retrieved from the Experts Database. 4.3. Expert ontology generation The discovered knowledge on experts can be converted into ontology using the COGA approach. To apply COGA, we need to label classes corresponding to the knowledge stored in the Citation Database, Researcher

 cision. In addition, Ward X  X  method gives poor performance in terms of recall, precision and F -measure if the confidence threshold is assigned to higher values. 5.2. Comparison with other approaches
Our proposed approach has used CCA to integrate these two techniques. For comparison, we have used the the CCA-based approach (complete link and Ward X  X ). We have adopted the KSOM and ART for document clustering and ACA for author clustering.

From the three figures, the proposed CCA-based approach with the adopted complete link and Ward X  X  meth-ods are referred to as CCA-CL and CCA-Ward , whereas ACA , KSOM and ART represent author clustering, and document clustering based on the KSOM and ART techniques respectively.
 Experimental results have shown that the ACA-based author clustering technique achieved high recall. retrieve almost all researchers in a particular research group that corresponds to the input keywords. based on document clustering technique achieved good precision. However, as the document clustering techniques tend to generate a large number of clusters, documents published by a certain researcher are retrieval. Thus, document clustering techniques do not achieve good recall. Generally, KSOM-based docu-ment clustering technique achieved better retrieval performance than the ART-based clustering in terms of the F -measure.

Combining the clustering results of both techniques together, the CCA-based technique achieved by the CCA-based approach was significantly better than the author clustering technique. As a result, the average F -measure of the CCA-based approach was considerably better than the others. This is shown in
Fig. 14 . 6. Conclusion
A number of citation databases have been constructed, including some commercial ones. In this paper, we have surveyed some of the most popular citation-based document retrieval systems. Our survey has revealed development of PubSearch, we have significantly improved the performance of our citation-based document

First, we tested the system for finding expert based on recall, precision and F -measure, Ward X  X  method measure. Next, we compared two CCA implementations with other approaches, namely ACA, KSOM and Appendix Vectorization: some formal definitions:

Example A1. Fig. A1 illustrates the corresponding cross-clustering relation of a relationship vector ({1,2},{2,3}) generated when combining document and author clustering results. It implies a relation from a set of document clusters { C 1 , C 2 } to a set of author cluster (CA 3.2.2.
