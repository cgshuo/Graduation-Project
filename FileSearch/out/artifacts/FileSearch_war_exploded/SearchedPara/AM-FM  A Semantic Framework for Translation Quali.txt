 Evaluation has always been one of the major issues in Machine Translation research, as both human and automatic evaluation methods exhibit very important limitations. On the one hand, although highly reliable, in addition to being expensive and time consuming, human evaluation suffers from inconsistency problems due to inter-and intra-annotator agreement issues. On the other hand, while being consistent, fast and cheap, automatic evaluation has the major disadvantage of requiring reference translations. This makes automatic eval-uation not reliable in the sense that good transla-tions not matching the av ailable references are evaluated as poor or bad translations. 
The main objective of this work is to propose and evaluate AM-FM, a semantic framework for assessing translation quality without the need for reference translations. The proposed framework is theoretically grounded on the classical concepts of adequacy and fluency, and it is designed to account for these two components of translation quality in an independent manner. First, a cross-language la-tent semantic indexing model is used for assessing the adequacy component by directly comparing the output translation with the input sentence it was generated from. Second, an n-gram based language model of the target language is used for assessing the fluency component. 
Both components of the metric are evaluated at the sentence level, providing the means for defin-ing and implementing a sentence-based evaluation metric. Finally, the two components are combined into a single measure by implementing a weighted harmonic mean, for which the weighting factor can be adjusted for optimizing the metric performance. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2, presents some background work and the specific dataset that has b een used in the experi-mental work. Section 3, provides details on the proposed AM-FM framework and the specific met-ric implementation. Section 4 presents the results of the conducted comparative evaluations. Finally, section 5 presents the main conclusions and rele-vant issues to be dealt with in future research. Although BLEU (Papineni et al. , 2002) has be-come a de facto standard for machine translation evaluation, other metrics such as NIST (Dodding-ton, 2002) and, more recently, Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), are commonly used too. Regard-ing the specific idea of evaluating machine trans-lation without using reference translations, several works have proposed and evaluated different ap-proaches, including round-trip translation (Somers, 2005; Rapp, 2009), as well as other regression-and classification-based approaches (Quirk, 2004; Ga-mon et al. , 2005; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007; Specia et al. , 2009). 
As part of the recent efforts on machine transla-tion evaluation, two workshops have been organiz-ing shared-tasks and evaluation campaigns over the last four years: the NIST Metrics for Machine Translation Challenge 1 (MetricsMATR) and the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation 2 (WMT); which were actually held as one single event in their most recent edition in 2010. The dataset used in this work corresponds to WMT-07. This dataset is used, instead of a more recent one, because no human judgments on ade-quacy and fluency have been conducted in WMT after year 2007, and human evaluation data is not freely available from MetricsMATR. 
In this dataset, translation outputs are available for fourteen tasks involving five European lan-guages: English (EN), Spanish (ES), German (DE), French (FR) and Czech (CZ); and two domains: News Commentaries (News) and European Par-liament Debates (EPPS). A complete description on WMT-07 evaluation campaign and dataset is available in Callison-Burch et al. (2007). 
System outputs for fourteen of the fifteen sys-tems that participated in the evaluation are availa-ble. This accounts for 86 independent system outputs with a total of 172,315 individual sentence translations, from which only 10,754 were rated for both adequacy and fluency by human judges. 
The specific vote standardization procedure de-scribed in section 5.4 of Blatz et al. (2003) was applied to all adequacy and fluency scores for re-moving individual voting patterns and averaging votes. Table 1 provides information on the corre-sponding domain, and sour ce and target languages for each of the fourteen translation tasks, along with their corresponding number of system outputs and the amount of sentence translations for which human evaluations are available. Table 1: Domain, source language, target lan-guage, system outputs and total amount of sentence translations (with both adequacy and fluency hu-man assessments) included in the WMT-07 dataset The framework proposed in this work (AM-FM) aims at assessing translation quality without the need for reference transl ations, while maintaining consistency with human quality assessments. Dif-ferent from other approaches not using reference translations, we rely on a cross-language version of latent semantic indexing (Dumais et al. , 1997) for creating a semantic space where translation outputs and inputs can be directly compared. 
A two-component evaluation metric, based on the concepts of adequacy and fluency (White et al. , 1994) is defined. While adequacy accounts for the amount of source meaning being preserved by the translation (5:all, 4:most, 3:much, 2:little, 1:none), fluency accounts for the quality of the target lan-guage in the translation (5:flawless, 4:good, 3:non-native, 2:disfluent, 1:incomprehensible). 3.1 Metric Definition For implementing the adequacy-oriented compo-nent (AM) of the metric, the cross-language latent semantic indexing approach is used (Dumais et al. , 1997), in which the source sentence originating the translation is used as evaluation reference. Accord-ing to this, the AM component can be regarded to be mainly adequacy-oriented as it is computed on a cross-language semantic space. 
For implementing the fluency-oriented compo-nent (FM) of the proposed metric, an n-gram based language model approach is used (Manning and Schutze, 1999). This compone nt can be regarded to be mainly fluency-oriented as it is computed on the target language side in a manner that is totally in-dependent from the source language. 
For combining both components into a single metric, a weighted harmonic mean is proposed: 
AM-FM = AM FM / (  X  AM + (1- X  ) FM ) (1) where  X  is a weighting factor ranging from  X  =0 (pure AM component) to  X  =1 (pure FM compo-nent), which can be adjusted for maximizing the correlation between the proposed metric AM-FM and human evaluation scores. 3.2 Implementation Details The adequacy-oriented component of the metric (AM) was implemented by following the proce-dure proposed by Dumais et al. (1997), where a bilingual collection of data is used to generate a cross-language projection matrix for a vector-space representation of texts (Salton et al. , 1975) by using singular value decomposition: SVD (Golub and Kahan, 1965). 
According to this formulation, a bilingual term-document matrix X ab of dimensions M * N , where M= ( M a + M b ) are vocabulary terms in languages a and b , and N are documents (sentences in our case), can be decomposed as follows: where [ X a ; X b ] is the concatenation of the two monolingual term-document matrices X a and X b (of dimensions M a * N and M b * N ) corresponding to the available parallel training collection, U ab and V ab are unitary matrices of dimensions M * M and N
N , respectively, and  X  is an M * N diagonal matrix containing the singular values associated to the de-composition. 
From the singular value decomposition depicted in (2), a low-dimensional representation for any sentence vector x a or x b , in language a or b , can be computed as follows: where y a and y b represent the L-dimensional vec-tors corresponding to the projections of the full-dimensional sentence vectors x a and x b , respective-composed of the first L column vectors of the unitary matrix U ab obtained in (2). 
Notice, from (3a) and (3b), how both sentence vectors x a and x b are padded with zeros at each corresponding other-language vocabulary locations for performing the cross-language projections. As similar terms in differe nt languages would have similar occurrence patterns, theoretically, a close representation in the cross-language reduced space should be obtained for terms and sentences that are semantically related. Therefore, sentences can be compared across languages in the reduced space. 
The AM component of the metric is finally com-puted in the projected space by using the cosine similarity between the source and target sentences: where P is the projection matrix U ab M representations of the source and target sentences being compared (with their target and source vocabulary elements set to zero, respectively), and | | is the L2-norm operator. In a final implementa-tion stage, the range of AM is restricted to the interval [0,1] by truncating negative results. 
For computing the projection matrices, random sets of 10,000 parallel sentences 3 were drawn from the available training datasets. The only restriction we imposed to the extract ed sentences was that each should contain at least 10 words. Seven pro-jection matrices were constructed in total, one for each different combination of domain and lan-guage pair. TF-IDF weighting was applied to the constructed term-documen t matrices while main-taining all words in the vocabularies (i.e. no stop-words were removed). All computations related to SVD, sentence projections and cosine similarities were conducted with MATLAB. 
The fluency-oriented component FM is imple-mented by using an n-gram language model. In order to avoid possible effects derived from dif-ferences in sentence lengths, a compensation factor is introduced in log-probability space. According to this, the FM component is computed as follows: where p(w n |w n-1 ,...) represent the target language n-gram probabilities and N is the total number of words in the target sentence being evaluated. 
By construction, the values of FM are also re-stricted to the interval [0,1]; so, both component values range within the same interval. 
Fourteen language models were trained in total, one per task, by using the available training data-sets. The models were computed with the SRILM toolbox (Stolcke, 2002). 
As seen from (4) and (5), different from con-ventional metrics that compute matches between translation outputs and references, in the AM-FM framework, a semantic embedding is used for as-sessing the similarities between outputs and inputs (4) and, independently, an n-gram model is used for evaluating output language quality (5). In order to evaluate the AM-FM framework, two comparative evaluations with standard metrics were conducted. More specifically, BLEU, NIST and Meteor were considered, as they are the met-rics most frequently used in machine translation evaluation campaigns. 4.1 Correlation with Human Scores In this first evaluation, AM-FM is compared with standard evaluation metrics in terms of their corre-lations with human-generated scores. Different from Callison-Burch et al. (2007), where Spear-man X  X  correlation coefficients were used, we use here Pearson X  X  coefficients as, instead of focusing on ranking; this first evaluation exercise focuses on evaluating the significance and noisiness of the association, if any, between the automatic metrics and human-generated scores. Three parameters should be adjusted for the AM-FM implementation described in (1): the di-mensionality of the reduced space for AM, the or-der of n-gram model for FM, and the harmonic mean weighting parameter  X  . Such parameters can be adjusted for maximizing the correlation coeffi-cient between the AM-FM metric and human-generated scores. 4 After exploring the solution space, the following values were selected, dimen-sionality for AM: 1,000 ; order of n-gram model for FM: 3 ; and, weighting parameter  X  : 0.30
In the comparative evaluation presented here, correlation coefficients between the automatic met-rics and human-generated scores were computed at the system level (i.e. the units of analysis were sys-tem outputs), by considering all 86 available sys-tem outputs (see Table 1). For computing human scores and AM-FM at the system level, average values of sentence-based scores for each system output were considered. 
Table 2 presents the Pearson X  X  correlation coef-ficients computed between the automatic metrics (BLEU, NIST, Meteor and our proposed AM-FM) and the human-generated scores (adequacy, fluen-cy and the harmonic mean of both; i.e. 2af/(a+f) ). All correlation coefficients presented in the table are statistically significant with p&lt;0.01 (where p is the probability of getting the same correlation coefficient, with a similar number of 86 samples, by chance).
 Table 2: Pearson X  X  correlation coefficients (com-puted at the system level) between automatic met-rics and human-generated scores 
As seen from the table, BLEU is the metric ex-hibiting the largest correlation coefficients with human-generated scores, followed by Meteor and AM-FM, while NIST exhibits the lowest correla-tion coefficient values. Recall that our proposed AM-FM metric is not usi ng reference translations for assessing translation quality, while the other three metrics are. 
In a similar exercise, the correlation coefficients were also computed at the sentence level (i.e. the units of analysis were sentences). These results are summarized in Table 3. As metrics are computed at the sentence level, smoothed-bleu (Lin and Och, 2004) was used in this case. Again, all correlation coefficients presented in the table are statistically significant with p&lt;0.01 .
 Table 3: Pearson X  X  correlation coefficients (com-puted at the sentence level) between automatic metrics and human-generated scores As seen from the table, in this case, BLEU and Meteor are the metrics exhibiting the largest correlation coefficients, followed by AM-FM and NIST. 4.2 Reproducing Rankings In addition to adequacy and fluency, the WMT-07 dataset includes rankings of sentence translations. To evaluate the usefulness of AM-FM and its components in a different evaluation setting, we also conducted a comparative evaluation on their capacity for predicting human-generated rankings. 
As ranking evaluations allowed for ties among sentence translations, we restricted our analysis to evaluate whether automatic metrics were able to predict the best, the worst and both sentence trans-lations for each of the 4,060 available rankings 5 The number of items per ranking varies from 2 to 5, with an average of 4.11 items per ranking. Table 4 presents the results of the comparative evaluation on predicting rankings . 
As seen from the table, Meteor is the automatic metric exhibiting the largest ranking prediction capability, followed by BLEU and NIST, while our proposed AM-FM metric exhibits the lowest rank-ing prediction capability. However, it still performs well above random chance predictions, which, for the given average of 4 items per ranking, is about 25% for best and worst ranking predictions, and about 8.33% for both. Again, recall that the AM-FM metric is not using reference translations, while the other three metrics are. Also, it is worth mentioning that human rankings were conducted by looking at the reference translations and not the source. See Callison-Burch et al. (2007) for details on the human evaluation task. Table 4: Percentage of cases in which each auto-matic metric is able to predict the best, the worst, and both ranked sentence translations 
Additionally, results for the individual compo-nents, AM and FM, are also presented in the table. Notice how the AM component exhibits a better ranking capability than the FM component. This work presented AM-FM, a semantic frame-work for translation quality assessment. Two com-parative evaluations with standard metrics have been conducted over a large collection of human-generated scores involving different languages. Although the obtained performance is below stand-ard metrics, the proposed method has the main advantage of not requiring reference translations. 
Notice that a monolingual version of AM-FM is also possible by using monolingual latent semantic indexing (Landauer et al. , 1998) along with a set of reference translations. A detailed evaluation of a monolingual implementation of AM-FM can be found in Banchs and Li (2011). 
As future research, we plan to study the impact of different dataset sizes and vector space model parameters for improving the performance of the AM component of the metric. This will include the study of learning curves based on the amount of training data used, and the evaluation of different vector model construction strategies, such as re-moving stop-words and considering bigrams and word categories in addition to individual words. Finally, we also plan to study alternative uses of AM-FM within the context of statistical machine translation as, for example, a metric for MERT optimization, or using the AM component alone as an additional feature for decoding, rescoring and/or confidence estimation.
