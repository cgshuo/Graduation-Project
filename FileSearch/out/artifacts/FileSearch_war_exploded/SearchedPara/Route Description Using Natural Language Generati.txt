 Natural language generation (NLG) is the subfield of artificial intelligence and that can produce understandable texts in human languages and form some underlying non-linguistic representation of information in order to meet specified communicative goals (McDonald, 1987). The technology has been used in a wide variety of systems and contexts (Reiter, 2000). aides in general they help to solve a real world problem; second, despite their changing direction along a line or a plane, or as a network of nodes and links. Route description can be broken into segments consisting of four elements: start point, reorientation/direction, path/progression and end point (Denis, 1994). Human X  X  route However, many communications contain missing information that can be inferred from context or medium (Clark, 1977). Two simple rules of inference allow recovery of most of the missing information: According to  X  X ontinuity X  rule, if a start point is forward (Tversky, 1998). Gedolf (2002) described an approach to developing a mode of interaction which supports the cognitive involvement of the user in performing the task of following a route description. 
There already exists a considerable res earch in automatic generation of natural language route description. A majority of these approaches are all concerned with establishing a link between GIS knowledge and linguistic realization principles. Pattabhiraman (1990) pointed the importance of salience and relevance in content directions from a given source to an inte nded destination within a city. Fraczak (1998) developed a system producing variants of subway route directions by mapping the relative importance of information entities onto syntactico-semantic features. A multimodal concerning with the generation of multimodal route description that combine natural language, maps and perspective views is developed for computer assisted vehicle navigation (Maa X , 1993). M aa X  (1995) indicated that incremental route description can be classified by a small set of syntactic and semantic structures. Williams (1999) studied the collections of the corpus contains 56 monologue descriptions of routes around a university department building, which was used to improve a natural language generation systems that generates prosodically annotated routes to be spoken by a speech synthesizer. 
There are a lot of successful way-finding systems based on NLG technology, directions, such as MapBlast 1 , MapPoint 2 and MapQuest 3 . However, there are only a few such web-based systems in Chinese. With the example of 51map 4 , it is the visually identified on the map and natural language descriptions of its route plans can generated automatically. 
Although there are some differences of detail in the user interfaces, all these systems are similar in concept and content. The route description approaches commonly-used by Chinese way-finding systems are identified four typical disadvantages: z Instructive landmarks and visible features of the environment to identify turning z These systems generate route description by one-sentence-per-step mappings z Only bus route description or driving information is provided. In fact, route 
Our work is concerned with the techniques of Chinese route description for way-finding systems based on the datasets of underlying geographical information systems (GIS), which incorporates NLG technology to produce more natural-sounding route description. There are many ways of building applied NLG systems. From a pragmatic perspective the most common architecture in applied NLG systems includes three stages. development of practical systems in limited domains is schemas. A route description description schema are paths, locations, directions, distance, landmarks, and temporal structure etc., and events and states are used in higher-order structures. A majority of this information can be derived from GIS datasets. Sentence planning : This stage combines sentence aggregation, lexicalization, and referring expression generation. Once the content of individual sentences has been determined, this still has to be mapped into morphologically and grammatically well-formed words and sentences. Sentence aggregation is the process of grouping messages together into sentences. It can be used to form paragraphs and other higher-order structures as well as sentences. communicate messages. From a knowledge perspective, the realizer is the module syntactic and morphological knowledge, such as rules about verb group formation, agreement and syntactically required pronominalization. referring to the path finding process, man kn ows where to go at a decision point. Path-important for the language generation process. the travelable paths between points; and polg ygons are used to represent areas such as lengths of paths, categories of points of interest and so on. 
The first step of route description is to get paths mapping the user X  X  query requirements based on a given GIS. The sh ortest route algorithm is effective to implement this task. In this paper, we select the commonly-used algorithm developed description can be derived easily. 
Road names are one of the most useful reference information from the view of travelers. Road names can be easily extracted on the basis of a definite path. points is less than 200m for walking directions or less than 500 m for driving representing distances in terms required by the text planner. Direction is the most important inductive information in the route description. Absolute directions refer to the cardinal points of the compass marked as north, south, locationally and culturally variable. People usually are confused by the identification right. However, the identification of left and right directions is dependent on absolute system and additional inference modules. The text planner uses additional procedural domain knowledge for retrieving or computing orientation information. 
Location information is crucial at transfer points. Additional descriptions of routes needs to be on the bus, train, etc, and assure her that she is still on the right back. The (Denis, 1994). 
Retrieving landmarks for describing locations of sources and destinations requires examining finer-grainer spatial layout information at the neighborhood of these the locative relation between the two objects, and expressing the relation in language as in right by. Route description information derived from GIS must be combined sentences via language characteristics and human spatial cognition custom. z Common verbs:  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  (walk) (walk or go) (get at)... z Spatial verbs:  X   X  (pass)  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  (get) (turn) (turn)... z Connection:  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  (then) (then) (then) (then) (then)... z Direction:  X  (left)  X  X  X  (right)  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X   X  X  X   X  (east) (south) (west)... z Preposition: z Phrases:  X  X  X   X  ...... (Start at)  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  (see along this road)... The grammar rules for Chinese route description (in short RD) are defined by: &lt; RD&gt; : : = { &lt; Unit RD &gt; } &lt; RD &gt; : : = { &lt; Modifier phrase&gt; } &lt; Action&gt; [ &lt;Object&gt; ] &lt;Modifier phrase&gt; : : = &lt; Action&gt; &lt; Object&gt; | &lt; Common modifier&gt; &lt; Object&gt; : : = &lt; Geographical feature&gt; | &lt; Distance&gt; | &lt; Direction&gt; &lt; Action&gt; : : = &lt; Common verb&gt; | &lt; Spatial verb&gt; &lt; Geographical feature &gt; : : = &lt; Geometric object &gt; | &lt; Road &gt; &lt; Distance&gt; : : = &lt; Number&gt; &lt; Metric&gt; &lt; Direction&gt; : : = &lt; Absolute direction&gt; | &lt; Relative direction&gt; &lt; Common verb&gt; : : =  X  X  X  (walk or go)|  X   X  (walk)| ... &lt; Spatial verb&gt; : : =  X  X  X   X  X  X  (Pass)| (Get)|... A description schema provides the semantic of a route description. Over 60 unit schemata are stored in the linguistic knowledge base, such as follows: z Phrase + start point z [Phrase] + [Directional preposition]+Action+[Distance]+Objective point z [Connection] + [Preposition] + Phrase + Road names z [Directional preposition] +Action+ [Phrase] + Progression point. z Action+ [Directional or other preposition]+ [Phrase]+Landmarks route description. According the continuity and forward progression rules described in section 1, a combined schema is defined as the incremental integration of unit schemata. Based on the above mentioned techniques, we develop a prototype of route description system. An example is given as follows: Departure:  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (Jin Ying Shopping Center) Destination:  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (Hua Lian Hotel) 
Route description:  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  17  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (Start at Jin Ying Shopping Center, turn right at the junction, and walk along Wan Fu Da Jie, see Nanjing Huan Lian Group, Nanjing Modern Survey Technology Company along this road, at Shi Gu LV go forward until hand.) 
It is very interesting that the same query may generate a different route description at a different time, because the system can select some terms and schemata randomly in order to generate more natural-sounding descriptions. In this paper we presented an approach that takes as input datasets of underlying GIS, categories of terms, grammar rules and syntax schemata. Further experimentation demonstrates that the presented approach can achieve more satisfactory performance than the existing way-finding systems e.g.51map and some driving navigation systems.
