 Information access is becoming increasingly heterogeneous. Especially when the user X  X  information need is for exploratory purpose, returning a set of diverse results from different re-sources could benefit the user. For example, when a user is planning a trip to China, retrieving and showing results from vertical search engines like travel, flight information, map and Q2A sites can satisfy the user X  X  rich and diverse information need. This heterogeneous search paradigm is useful in many contexts and brings many new challenges.

The environment where users interact within is becom-ing increasingly heterogeneous. On the Web, we have now many search engines, so-called verticals , each targeting a specific type of information (e.g. image, news, video) to sat-isfy the user X  X  information need [3]. Aggregating search re-sults from those heterogeneous verticals has become de-facto search paradigm (aggregated search) in commercial search engines [1, 8]. It is also common that users search their own desktop (e.g. Spotlight) to re-find or browse different types of files (codes, documents, emails) when aiming to fulfill a given work task [5]. More recently, systems such as Google Now, Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana aim to proactively recommend heterogeneous cards (e.g. weather, stocks, news, calendar) to the users, even without users to issue the query [7]. Due to the rising heterogeneous nature of the informa-tion that users can access, numerous challenges have arisen.
