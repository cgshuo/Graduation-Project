 Domain expertise can have an important influence on how people search. In this poster we present findings from a log-based study into how medical domain experts search the Web for information related to their expertise, as compared with non-experts. We find differences in sites visited, query vocabulary, and search behavior. The findings have implications for the automatic identification of domain experts from interaction logs, and the use of domain knowledge in applications such as query suggestion or page recommendation to support non-experts.

The amount of knowledge a person has about a particular domain can be an important determinant of their search behavior and ultimately, their search success. Domain expertise has been studied extensively in the information science community [6]. It differs from search expertise, in that it concerns subject-matter knowledge rather than search knowledge. Studies of domain expertise have highlighted several differences between experts and novices, including: site selection and sequencing [3], task completion time [2], vocabulary and search expression [1], and the number and length of queries, and search effectiveness [7]. These studies involved small numbers of subjects with carefully controlled tasks, making it difficult to generalize their findings. This poster presents a large-scale log-based study of Web search behavior. It contrasts the search strategies of domain experts with those of domain non-experts through analysis of naturalistic interaction log data over a three-month period of time. This large-scale analysis allows us to identify greater diversity in vocabulary, site visits, and user tasks than with smaller-scale studies, e.g. , [3]. We focus on the medical domain because of the complexity of the subject matter and potential benefit to novices of identifying effective search strategies. In addition to highlighting differences in the search behavior of experts and non-experts, we describe the potential benefits of being able to identify domain experts and leverage their querying strategies and source selection abilities. To study the effects of domain expertise on Web search, we first selected a set of people interested in the medical domain. From this group of interested people we separated experts from non-experts based on visitation to a specialist medical search engine. We used the interaction logs of over 500 thousand consenting users from a three-month period from May 2007 to July 2007. From these logs we extracted: (i) browser trails , a temporally-ordered set of URLs comprising all pages viewed per Web browser instance or browser tab, and (ii) search sessions, subsets of browser trails, beginning with a query to a search engine such as Google, Yahoo!, or Live Search, and terminating with a period of user inactivity of 30 or more minutes. This threshold has been used previously to demarcate search sessions in logs [4]. To identify users interested in the medical domain we classified pages in the browser trails into the topics from a Web directory. Given the large number of pages involved, the classification needed to be automatic. Our classifier assigned labels to pages based on the top level of the Open Directory Project (ODP) in a similar way to [5], by starting with URLs that were in the ODP and backing-off to cover other URLs. Using this classifier we identified the proportion of pages that each user visited that were medically related ( i.e. , those in the  X  X ealth X  category of the ODP). While the goal was to identify people with some degree of interest in medical topics, we also wanted to remove outliers who viewed mainly medical pages ( e.g. , data-entry workers employed to process prescriptions), or viewed few medical pages, since both groups may skew our analysis. Thus, we selected people whose page views contained between 5% and 50% medically-related pages. This resulted in the selection of 16,658 medical users. The logs contain 1,129,398 search sessions for these users. To identify experts and non-experts, we divided users based on whether they had ever visited or queried for the PubMed search engine. 1 PubMed is used primarily by medical researchers and physicians, and provides access to citations and abstracts of biomedical research articles. PubMed visitation therefore seemed to be an appropriate expertise filter. This approach classified 15.6% of the people interested in the medical domain as experts and 84.4% as non-experts. We also classified each search session from these two groups as medical or non-medical based on whether the session contained a page tagged with the ODP label  X  X ealth X  by our classifier. This provides us with medical experts and non-experts, engaged in medical and non-medical sessions. We compared the characteristics of the pages visited (source selection), search queries, and search sessions of experts and non-experts. Table 1 shows the mean (M ), standard deviation (SD ), and median values for search and browsing features for each group during medical and non-medical search sessions. Given the large sample sizes, all observed differences in the means between groups were statistically significant ( i.e. , all p &lt; http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov measures t-tests). We applied Cohen X  X  d -tests to determine the effect size for each between-group comparison and h ighlight the pertinent effect sizes in the following findings su mmary. We begin by summarizing interaction patterns for medic al sessions. Source selection : Experts visited different sites than non-experts. Domain experts primarily visited technical sites ( e.g. , nih.gov, mayoclinic.com, nejm.org), and non-experts visited consumer-oriented sites about health and wellbeing rather th an only medical issues ( e.g. , about.com, calorie-count.com, webmd.com ).
 Queries : Experts issued longer queries than non-experts (d = 0.62). We also analyzed the technical nature of the query vocabulary used by the two groups. To quantify this we comput ed the proportion of queries that contained complex clinic al terminology from parts of the Unified Medical Language System ( UMLS) MetaThesaurus. 2 As can be seen in Table 1 (bolded row), experts used many more technical query terms than non-exper ts (d =1.14). Sessions : Experts exhibited different search behaviors than non-experts. Per session, experts: issued more queries (d =0.30), branched more ( i.e. , revisited an earlier page in the session and then browsed to a new page) (d =0.32), visited more unique domains (d =0.36), and spent longer searching (d =0.14). While there were substantial differences between me dical experts and novices for medical sessions, the differences w ere relatively small for non-medical sessions. This suggests that our participants were similar in their general search behaviors, and differed mainly in sessions where domain expertise was relevant. One challenge in interpreting these results is that experts and non-experts may be searching for different things rathe r than searching differently  X  that is, the observed differences may be task differences rather than expertise differences. To a ddress this concern we developed two methods to identify compar able tasks. For one, we identified search sessions that began w ith the same query. There were 12 queries describing medical co nditions ( e.g. , pregnancy, diabetes, HIV), issued at least ten time s by both experts and non-experts. We also identified sessio ns that ended http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/umlsmeta.htm l with the same URL. For the matched queries and ses sions, the between-group differences noted earlier in this sec tion held. Thus, it seems that even for similar information ne eds experts and non-experts still search differently. We have described the first large-scale log-based s tudy of domain expertise in Web search. Our findings show that we can identify domain experts (and comparable non-experts) from lo gs. In line with previous work ( e.g. , [6]), we showed that domain experts search differently than non-experts in terms of the sites they visit, the query vocabulary they use, and their patterns o f interaction. The biggest differences were in their queries and s ource selection. We believe that these features can be used to autom atically identify and quantify domain expertise from search and browse logs. Identifying domain experts makes it possible to provide expert query suggestions and site recommendations t o non-expert users, and to personalize search results based on e xpertise. Our future work will focus on the development of such a pplications and on the extension of the methods described to ot her domains. [1] Allen, B.L. (1991).
