 If you're still recovering from the barrage of ads, news, ema ils, Facebook posts, and newspaper articles that were giving you the latest poll numbers, asking you to volunteer, donate money, and vote, this talk will give you a look behind the scenes on why you were seeing what you were seeing. I will talk about how m achine learning and data mining along with randomized experiments were used to target and influence tens of millions of people. Beyond the presidential elections, these methodologies for targeting and influence have the power to solve big problems in education, healthcare, energy, transportation, and related areas. I will talk about some recent work we're doing at the University of Chicago Data Science for Social Good summer fellowship program working with non -profits and government organizations to tackle some of these challenges.
