 One challenging problem for biomedical text retrieval is to find accurate synonyms or name variants for biomedical en-tities. In this paper, we propose a new concept-based ap-proach to tackle this problem. In this approach, a set of concepts instead of keywords will be extracted from a query first. Then these concepts will be used for retrieval purpose. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can boost the retrieval performance and it generates very good results on 2005 TREC Genomics data sets.
 H.3.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Search and Re-trieval Experimentation Biomedical Text Retrieval, Concept, Information Retrieval
Information Retrieval (IR) in the context of biomedical databases has the following three major problems [3]: the frequent use of (possibly non-standardized) acronyms, the presence of homonyms (the same word referring to two or more different entities) and synonyms (two or more words referring to the same entity). How to deal with an abundant number of lexical variants of the same term is a challenging task in biomedical IR. In biomedical domain, using one or two keywords to retrieve the corresponding concept is usu-ally not enough. Thus, concept-oriented retrieval techniques have drawn much attention recently from researchers since traditional keyword-based retrieval fails to meet the require-ments for both precision and recall.

TREC Genomics Track [7] provides a platform for eval-uation of information retrieval systems in the genomics do-main. In the 2005 Genomic Track, most of groups agreed that methods need to be developed for expanding the query to include a more complete set of name variants for a biomed-ical entity. Huang, Zhong and Luo [6] proposed a method to extract name variants from domain-specific database. Ando, Dredze and Tong [1] proposed a method only for the names which have the form  X  X BC1 X . However, their methods are either tedious or incomplete. In addition, how to organize these name variants into a concept is not clear. To address these issues, we propose a concept based approach which includes concept detection, concept expansion and concept representation.
For the concept detection, a set of concepts will be ex-tracted from the query first. This process can be described as follows: (1) extract the full name of a biomedical entity and its abbreviation by using BioNLP abbreviation extrac-tion function [4]; (2) take out all the stop words; (3) generate a concept 1 .

Before we present how to expand the concept, we would like to define the following two terms:  X  X reak-point X  and  X  X eplacement X . A break-points is a position in a string that can be broken into two parts separated by a space. It can be (1) a hyphen; (2) a position between two letters which have different cases except for the first and second positions of a word; (3) a position between a letter and a digit. For example, the word  X 185delAG X  has 2 break-points. Thus, its variants are  X 185 delAG X ,  X 185del AG X  and  X 185 del AG X . More examples for break-points are given in Table 1. A replacement is a substring in a string that can be re-placed by a different string and the string after replacing still represents the same meaning as the original one. For example, the number  X 2 X  in  X  X OP2 X  is a replacement which can be replaced by  X  X i X .  X  X lpha X  is a replacement that can be replaced by  X  X  X  and  X  X eta X  is a replacement that can be replaced by  X  X  X , and so on. Detailed examples for replace-ments are given in Table 2.

Given the above two definitions, we describe the algo-rithm for concept expansion as follows: (1) Locate all the
The full name and its corresponding abbreviations repre-sent the same concept. break-points; (2) Create the variants for the first break-point. Repeat this process until all the break-points have been processed; (3) For each variant generated from Step 2, substitute the replacement with the corresponding string for creating more variants. For each variant, we search it against the corpus. Only those variants that have non-zero occurrences will be considered as valid ones. For example, TGF-Beta1 is expanded to a set of variants shown in Ta-ble 3. All these variants will be considered as the same concept.
For all the variants of a biological entity, we treat them as the same concept. These variants will be connected by the symbol  X + X  to represent a concept. We implement a new function for concept retrieval on Okapi retrieval system by normalizing the Robertson-Sparck Jones weight (RSJ). More background knowledge about Okapi and RSJ weight can be found in [2]. Assume that there is a concept C = t to an identical concept C , then the RSJ weight for C is defined as follows: where N is the number of documents in the corpus, s t j is the set of documents containing the term or phrase t j , | s is the number of documents in this set. In addition, we only tokenize the full name and add each term as a concept into the query with an adjusted query term frequency.
We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the effec-tiveness of the proposed concept based approach. In the experiments, we preprocess the raw documents by replac-ing all the hyphens in corpus with spaces. Stemming and pseudo relevance feedback are used in all the experiments. For Okapi BM25, we set k 1 , k 2 , k 3 and b to be 1.4, 0, 8 and 0.55 respectively. Table 5 shows the experimental results on 50 topics provided by TREC 2005 Genomics track.
 In Table 4, we present the results in three measures (MAP, R-Prec and the total number of relevant documents retrieved).  X  X otal X  represents the total number of relevant documents Table 4: Results on 2005 Genomics Track Datasets retrieved. The 1st run describes the performance for the run without using the concept retrieval (CR). The 2nd and 3rd runs are obtained by disabling the  X  X reak-point X  func-tion and  X  X eplacement X  function respectively, while the 4th run is obtained by using the concept retrieval with all the functions activated 2 . The 5th and 6th rows are our official submissions to the 2005 Genomics track.

From Table 4, we can clearly see that the proposed con-cept based approach can increase the retrieval performance. In terms of MAP , the relative rate of improvement for the 4th run (0.3118) over the base run (0.2863) is 8.91%. Com-pared with the best automatic run in TREC 2005 Genomics track, the relative rate of improvement for the 4th run is 7.96% in terms of MAP .
We have proposed a concept-based approach for the pur-pose of biomedical text retrieval. Using concepts instead of keywords for the purpose of retrieval works well in the biomedical domain. We find that there may be no perfor-mance improvement by just creating variants for the biomed-ical terms without using concept-based retrieval. Compared with other methods, our approach is independent of any do-main database and easy to be implemented. Furthermore, it has been shown to be competitive and effective on the TREC Genomics data sets.
