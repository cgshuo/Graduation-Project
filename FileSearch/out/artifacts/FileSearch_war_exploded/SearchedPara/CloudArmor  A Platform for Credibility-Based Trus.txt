 Trust management of cloud services is emerging as an impor-tant research issue in recent years, which poses signi cant challenges because of the highly dynamic, distributed, and non-transparent nature of cloud services. This paper de-scribes Cloud Armor, a platform for credibility-based trust management of cloud services. The platform provides a crawler for automatic cloud services discovery, an adaptive and robust credibility model for measuring the credibility of feedbacks, and a trust-based recommender to recommend the most trustworthy cloud services to users. This paper presents the motivation, system design, implementation, and a demonstration of the Cloud Armor platform.

Cloud services refer to exible and on-demand infrastruc-tures, platforms and software provided as services. With the highly dynamic, distributed, and non-transparent na-ture of cloud services, trust management is considered one of the top 10 obstacles for cloud computing [3]. Trust man-agement of cloud services is not an easy task due to some unique characteristics of cloud services.

Firstly, cloud services are dynamic (e.g., new cloud ser-vices can be established to join other cloud services while old cloud services might discontinue around the clock ( http:// raydepena.wordpress.com/2011/01/01/90-cloud-computing -companies-to-watch-in-2011/ )). The majority of pub-licly available could services are not based on description standards which make the cloud service discovery a chal-lenging problem (e.g., some cloud services such as Dropbox do not use the word cloud in their description) [10, 4]. Sec-ondly, determining the credibility of trust feedbacks is a sig-ni cant challenge. It is dicult to know how experienced a cloud service consumer is and from whom malicious trust feedbacks are expected [7]. Last but not the least, trust-based cloud services recommendation is not an easy task because of the variety in cloud services' functionalities and features (i.e., some cloud services have similar functionali-ties and features while others do not [2, 9]). It is dicult to recommend trustworthy cloud services that suit all cloud service consumers (i.e., each user is looking for cloud services that support speci c functionalities and features). Motivated by these concerns, we have developed Cloud Armor, a platform for a credibility-based trust management of cloud services. The salient features of the platform are: i) the innovative use of a web crawling approach for auto-matic cloud services discovery; ii) an adaptive and robust credibility model for measuring the credibility of feedbacks; and iii) a trust-based recommender to recommend trustwor-thy cloud services that suit the users needs. In the following sections, we overview the design and implementation of the platform and sketch the proposed demonstration. Interested readers are referred to [8, 7, 6] for more technical details.
Cloud Armor provides an environment where consumers can give trust feedback and request trust assessment for a particular cloud service. The platform (Figure 1) exploits a web crawling approach for automatic cloud services discov-ery, which consists of the following main components: The Trust Data Provisioning. This component is re-sponsible for collecting cloud services and trust informa-tion. We developed the Cloud Services Crawler module based on the Open Source Web Crawler for Java (crawler4j -http://code.google.com/p/crawler4j/ ) and extend it to allow the platform to automatically discover cloud services on the Internet and store cloud services' information (e.g., the cloud service ID, URL and description) in the Cloud Ser-vices Repository . We implemented a set of functionalities to simplify the crawling process and make the crawled data more comprehensive (e.g., addSeeds() and selectCrawl-ingDomain() ). In addition, we developed the Trust Feed-backs Collector module to collect trust feedbacks directly from cloud service consumers in the form of history records and stores them in the Trust Feedbacks Database . Indeed, the cloud service consumers typically have to establish their identities for the rst time they attempt to use the platform through registering their credentials at the Identity Manage-ment Service (IdM) which stores the credentials in the Trust Identity Registry .
 The Trust and Credibility Assessment Function. This function is responsible for handling trust assessment requests from users where the trustworthinesses of cloud services are compared and the credibilities of trust feedbacks are calcu-lated. We developed the Credibility Calculator to measure the credibility of trust feedbacks based on a set of credibility factors to aggregate the credibility weights. The credibility factors include the cloud service consumers' experience fac-tor (i.e., which is calculated based on the cloud service con-sumer's capability and the majority consensus factors) and feedback density factor (more details on how the credibility factors are calculated can be found in [8, 7, 6]). Moreover, we developed the Trust Assessor to compare the trustwor-thiness of cloud services through requesting the aggregated credibility weights from the Credibility Calculator to weigh the trust feedbacks and then calculate the mean of all trust feedbacks given to each cloud service. The trust results for each cloud service and the credibility weights for trust feed-backs are stored in the databases (i.e., the Trust Results and Credibility Weights Storage in Figure 1).
 Trust-Based Cloud Services Recommendation. This component is responsible for recommending trustworthy cloud services to users. We developed the Cloud Services Recom-mender to recommend trustworthy cloud services that suit the users' needs using the Cloud Services Filter . The Cloud Services Filter lters cloud services based on the cloud ser-vice's category (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS based on key-words such as storage and host ) and their corresponding trust results. Consequently, the Cloud Services Recommender uses the trust assessment requests from users to recommend trustworthy cloud services that suit requesters' need.
We crawled review websites such as CloudHostingReviewer. com and cloud-computing.findthebest.com where consumers usually give their feedback on cloud services that they used. The collected data represents consumers feedback based on several Quality of Service (QoS) parameters including avail-ability, security, response time, etc. We managed to collect 10,076 feedbacks given by 6,982 consumers to 113 real-world cloud services. The collected dataset will be release to the re-search community in the project website ( http://cs.adelaide .edu.au/ cloudarmor ).
Cloud Armor provides an environment where cloud ser-vice consumers can give trust feedback and request trust a ssessment for a particular cloud service. In this demon-stration, we will focus on demonstrating: (i) how the cloud services are discovered and the trust feedbacks are collected, (ii) how the trust assessment requests are handled and the credibility aggregated weights are con gured, and (iii) how the trustworthy cloud services are recommended.
 Trust Data Provisioning. The cloud service crawler of-fers several functionalities that a system administrator can use for cloud service discovery and information collection. The system administrator can add speci c keywords for the crawling process, select the domain, and specify the time that the crawler starts the crawling process and the crawl-ing period. The cloud services' information is stored in the Cloud Services Repository to be displayed when users search for cloud services. Users can easily search for desirable cloud services and provide feedback to a particular cloud service. Trust and Credibility Assessment. The Trust Assessor gives cloud service users the ability to search for the cloud service that they want to assess where the trust result for the searched cloud service is then displayed. In addition, a detailed analysis of the trust feedback for the cloud service is also displayed. Several analysis controllers are provided for users such as credibility factors in calculating the trust re-sult and the ability to visualize the trust results for the cloud service based on di erent time period (e.g., in day, month, or year). The credibility calculator allows the administra-tor to tweak the credibility weights according to the trust assessment preferences.
 Trust-Based Cloud Services Recommendation. The Cloud Service Recommender allows users to receive recom-mendations of trustworthy cloud services based on the query that they used to search for cloud services. Cloud services are ranked according to their corresponding trust results where the top 10 trustworthy cloud services for all cloud services regardless their category (i.e., IaaS, PaaS or SaaS) are displayed. The Cloud Services Filter also provides the administrator with several functionalities such as the ability to choose the ltering technique (e.g., to lter the recom-mended cloud services based on the cloud services' category) where the top 10 trustworthy cloud services that are in the same category are displayed. The cloud services are cate-gorized using keywords chosen by the administrator (e.g., Storage, Online Backup, and WebHosting indicate IaaS).
Over the past few years, trust management has been one of the hot topics especially in the area of cloud comput-ing. Some of the research works use policy-based trust man-agement techniques. For example, Ko et al. [5] proposed TrustCloud framework for accountability and trust in cloud computing which consists of ve layers including work ow, data, system, policies and laws, and regulations layers to ad-dress accountability in the cloud from all aspects. Brandic et al. [1] proposed a novel approach for compliance man-agement in cloud environments to establish trust. Unlike previous works that use policy-based techniques, we evalu-ate the trustworthiness of a cloud service using reputation-based trust management techniques.

Other research works use reputation-based trust manage-ment techniques. For instance, Habib et al. [2] proposed a multi-faceted Trust Management (TM) system architecture which models uncertainty of trust information collected from multiple sources using a set of Quality of Service (QoS) at-tributes such as security, latency, availability, and customer support. Hwang et al. [3] proposed a security-aware cloud architecture where trust negotiation and data coloring tech-niques are used to support cloud providers and the trust-overlay to support consumers. Unlike previous works, we present a platform that not only measures the credibility of trust feedbacks, but also has the ability to recommend trustworthy cloud services based on the users' preferences.
In this demo, we have presented Cloud Armor, a plat-form for credibility-based trust management of cloud ser-vices. The platform exploits a web crawling approach for automatic cloud services discovery and a credibility model for measuring the credibility of trust feedbacks that under-pin a trust-based recommender to suggest trustworthy cloud services based on the users' preferences. We are currently extending and enhancing the cloud services crawler to have better cloud services discovery results. The performance op-timization of the trust management service is another focus of our future research work. Interested readers are referred to the project website for more details.
