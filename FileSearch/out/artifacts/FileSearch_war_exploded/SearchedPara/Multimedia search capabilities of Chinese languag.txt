 1. Introduction
China X  X  population of 1.3 billion people has approximately 130 million Web users. Some 70% of Chinese Web users are younger than 30, and are either single or married with one child. On July 19, 2006 MSNBC.com reported that Chinese Web-sites totaled 788,400 and the average Web user spent 16.5 h per week online. The Chinese Web market is second in size only to the United States and is the fastest growing market in the world. The average Chinese Web users are more interested in entertainment than news, hence most Chinese Web search engines are more entertainment and multimedia search oriented.
Major search engines such as Google and Yahoo are still emerging in the Chinese market and are significantly less popular than the Chinese Web search engine Baidu.com (Barboza, 2006 ).

Some studies have explored how search engines cope with languages other than English. Moukdad and Large (2001) tested AltaVista X  X  retrieval of Arabic documents and found that Arabic queries were not handled well, especially with regard to prefixes. Bar-Ilan and Gutman (2005) reported that Web search engines AltaVista, FAST, and Google ignored the structure and special characteristics of non-English languages such as Russian, French, Hungarian, and Hebrew, and could not handle diacritics effectively. To our knowledge, there have been few studies on the multimedia search capability of Chinese Web search engines.

Today, high-speed streaming media, video and audio are commonly used for pod-casting, internet radio stations and on-line music distribution. Consumer devices such as cameras, camcorders, and voice or mp3 recorders enable inexpensive con-it is commonplace. Although the searching of multimedia objects is an increasingly common activity, there is no universal map to help users locate multimedia content (Bruno, 2005 ). The number of Web multimedia objects is growing exponen-challenge for Web search engines. The need for better retrieval of multimedia content was previously noted, and some pro-Photobook ( Rui, Huang, &amp; Chang, 1997 ).

Previous studies on search engines have examined the indexing and retrieval of audio, image and video content ( Amir on general Web search engines as opposed to specialized multimedia Web search engines that are designed to identify spe-cific multimedia content. Although many general Web search engines have implemented multimedia search capabilities (Miller, 2007 ), their retrieval of multimedia content is limited compared to that of specialized multimedia search engines (Bruno, 2005 ).

General multimedia Web search engines include: GoFish (http://www.gofish.com ) for video retrieval; mSpace ( http:// mspace.fm ) tools for information space organizing for a person X  X  interest; Podzinger (http://www.podzinger.com/ ) for audio and Riya ( http://www.riya.com ) for face-recognition ( Overton, 2006 ). Some Web search engines are hybrids that use both text and image content features (Luo, Wang, &amp; Tang, 2003; Ozmutlu, Spink, &amp; Ozmutlu, 2003 ).

Podcast Web search engines retrieve content using two strategies: either by searching metadata or by converting audio 2003, it had indexed and cataloged approximately 30 million streams and downloadable files, and was adding between 150,000 and 250,000 more every week (Fritz, 2003 ). GoFish uses the same strategy as Singingfish, but focuses on online mu-file contains data where speech recognition techniques can be used.

Comparatively few studies have examined the multimedia search features offered by Chinese Web search engines. The next section of the paper outlines research that are related to our study, followed by the research design and results from our analysis. 2. Related studies
Some studies have examined distinct multimedia features in search engines and image, audio, and video retrieval ( Rui et al., 1997 ; Tjondronegoro &amp; Spink, 2008 ). Spink and Jansen (2004) reported that images were the most frequent multi-media objects searched. In addition, the sessions of image searches were longer than audio and video searches, and audio queries had the largest number of terms per query. Non-multimedia queries were shorter than multimedia queries, which included words such as  X  X  X icture X  or  X  X  X mage X . However, on the Dogpile Web meta-search engine, Web users accessing a diverse conglomerate of content collections had different search patterns (Spink &amp; Jansen, 2006 ). In general, most
Dogpile users used two to three words per query and inspected just the first results page. Text, audio and news searches 2006).

For image indexing, WebSeer and AltaVista photo finder use three main techniques to search multimedia objects: simi-larity with other images, text in HTML, and category utilization derived from object features. Length, key frame information and bandwidth are helpful in the identification of audio and video objects ( Swain, 1999 ). Some research on multimedia search engines are exploring speech recognition for audio and video classification, word identification for screening terms, document clustering, and image similarity (Swain, 1999 ). However, the majority of multimedia objects remain unsearchable and the dependence on text input remains. But most multimedia objects do not contain sufficient text for indexing and re-trieval in comparison with Web pages ( Deuel, 2004 ).

Much research has analyzed image retrieval ( Kherfi, Ziou, &amp; Bernardi, 2004 ). New multimedia search techniques include using spoken queries in mobile devices (Gu, Li, Walter, &amp; Chang, 2001 ), query expansion by mining the links among query discovery of significant video characteristics without requiring expert domain knowledge or labor-intensive human inter-vention ( Chang, 2005 ).

Non-English Web search techniques are not as mature as English content techniques (Chung et al., 2004 ). Multi-language support is not new for major search engines. In 1999, Google started offering Chinese multimedia search ( Levander, 2000 ).
The problem with Chinese language retrieval is that Chinese characters X  X eing pictographs rather than phonetic scripts X  ments from the content. Segmentation is also a challenge for metadata that describe multimedia objects. Methods of Chinese spite these challenges, Chinese multimedia search engines have great opportunities for improvement.
 The next section of the paper outlines the research questions and goal of this study.
 3. Research questions
This paper explores the multimedia search functionalities of major general and specialized Chinese multimedia search engines. The research questions examined were: 1. Which Chinese language search engines provide multimedia searching? 2. Which multimedia search functionalities are available in Chinese language search engines? Specifically, we examined: (a) the multimedia features X  features allowing multimedia search; (b) the extent of personalization X  the extent to which a search engine allows users to control multimedia search variables, and (c) the relationships between search engine and their features . 4. Research design 4.1. Data collection
The data analyzed in this study was collected between August to September 2006 and revisited in August 2007. The search engines studied were identified by three native Chinese speakers using Search Engine Colossus ( http://www.search-enginecolossus.com/China.html ), and supplemented with expert references and their personal experiences. Working inde-pendently, two of the speakers helped to collect the data using a list of multimedia web functionalities. The two sets of the data were compared to ensure accuracy.

Forty-seven Chinese language Web search engines were identified, including 18 general search engines, 23 specialized multimedia search engines and six specialized search engines not having multimedia capabilities. A specialized search engine is defined as a search engine that focuses on one specific topic, such as games, drivers or software. General Web search engines are those that search more than one topic, such as Web pages, images, audio files, and books ( Fig. 1 ). 4.2. Data analysis The methodology used to evaluate multimedia Web functionality was first developed by Tjondronegoro and Spink (2008) .
We applied it to the range of multimedia data types as previously identified by Pazanda and Srivastava (1997) and Yoshitaka and Ichikawa (1999) . 4.2.1. Qualitative analysis
A qualitative analysis of multimedia search features for each Chinese language search engine was conducted. The multi-(Rui et al., 1997 ), and advanced functions such as relevance feedback and the use of searching agents. The search features provided by each search engine was tabulated and analyzed, for example keywords, file size, file format, taxonomy of con-ables is provided in Appendix A .

The analysis was conducted using Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS), Logistic regression and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), all of which used binary data in the analysis. 4.2.2. Multi-dimensional scaling
MDS identifies hidden patterns in empirical data (Kruskal &amp; Wish 1978; Shepard, Rommey, and Nerlove, 1972 ), and uti-lizes proximity as a measure of similarity between two data sets. If there are few dissimilarities between two Web search engines are quite different in terms of features. An MDS map represents the variables under study in multi-dimensional space. Different methods have been developed that can help the researcher to identify the number of dimensions that yield the best representation of a specific dataset. While MDS is employed as an exploratory and descriptive technique to portray and evaluate the data, additional considerations have to be taken into account when interpreting many dimensions. Kruskal and Wish (1978), Coxon (1982), Dunn-Rankin, Knezek, Wallace, and Zhang (2002), and Cox and Cox (1994) offer detailed accounts of MDS.

We limited the number of dimensions evaluated using MDS techniques to six, defined by a goodness-of-fit measure, a 2. The representation of some search engines in the MDS map can be expressed formally using Logit Analysis in the following if it does not have it (DeMaris, 1992; Menard, 2001 ). The function can be expressed as
Cluster Analysis is a multivariate statistical method used to identify similarities among variables and homogeneous into a small number of generic groups, and each group is then subdivided into smaller groups. This subdivision process con-tinues until the smallest groups are identified. Another method of hierarchical clustering X  X he agglomerative method X  blends successive entities into groups (Everitt, 1980 ).

There are different methods or algorithms for grouping data in hierarchical cluster analysis, and using different clustering methods will produce different clusters. For example, the Nearest Neighbor Method groups the closest neighboring points, while Between-groups Linkage groups variables that have the minimal distance between them at each consecutive phase of clustering is an indication of the number of features in the cluster.

The last search engine to cluster was Baidu. This shows that Baidu had the maximum variance because Ward X  X  Method specific cluster. ChaoJi, HuaJun, MyDrivers, Skycn, and Soft8 were part of cluster 1, and these search engines were charac-terized by having moderately more negative values in the MDS dimensions.
 Features marked with an asterisk were those unique to that particular cluster. However, 21CN, 51Soshu, ODP, PKU, and EBook in cluster 3 did not share 23 features. Cluster 7 included the search engines 163, Chinasite, Google, MSN, Digdig, Gograph, XinHuanet, and Sohu. This cluster had four unique features in common that were not shared with other clusters:
Black and White, Greyscale and Full Color Images as well as the Moderate Filter. Search engines in cluster 8 had the family filter as a common feature. Finally, cluster 9 had four features in common: Org, Edu, and Gov domains as well as video (see
Table 1 ). 5. Results 5.1. Search engine functionalities
Table 2 summarizes the qualitative results of Chinese language Web search engine functionalities. Each row represents the percentage of Web search engines that support the respective feature.

Based on Logit Analysis ( Table 3 ), Yahoo, Souyo, Baidu, ODP, and EBook were well represented in the MDS dimensional representation. Cluster analysis provided further insight into the relationship between Web search engines and their fea-tures. After calculating the Euclidian distance between each pair of Web search engines, we concluded that the extreme val-ues in each dimension represented the Web search engines that had the greatest impact in that dimension. In addition, the search engines were in cluster 3 although did not share any common features.
 5.2. MDS maps
We examined the Web search engines that were located at the extreme ends of each dimension in the MDS maps. The features shared by the search engines at the extreme ends, either missing or present, are shown in Table 4 .
Predominant Value X  (NPV) means that some search engines have this feature in that dimension, but not all. To gain a more detailed analysis, each dimension was divided into positive and negative values, such as Dim1+ and Dim1 . The symbol  X  X 1  X  means that particular features are unique for that dimension and represent a search engine with extreme values. The symbol  X  X 0  X  indicates a feature is not supported by any of the search engines at the extreme ends in that dimension. Table 4 shows features with extreme values. 5.3. Features Fig. 4 summarizes the extreme values for each feature, using the last three columns in Table 4 .

The values in x -axis represent the features. For each of the 41 features, the search engines investigated were indicated by Topic-based feature was the least supported by the search engines at the extreme ends, with the highest number of zeros.
In general, many features were not well-supported by these search engines. Fig. 5 shows a summary of extreme values per dimension.

Fig. 5 uses the same notation as the previous and shows that dimension 1 had a good number of features, but a large num-ber of features were not represented in the extreme values. Dimension 2 in its negative side had few features and many fea-tures were not present.

This section highlighted several results from the data analysis. The percentages of general and specialized search engines that possess the investigated functionalities were presented. Cluster analysis revealed the relationships among Web search engines features, which showed the likelihood of finding several features in the same search engine. By identifying the ex-treme values of each dimension, we were able to discover major features that had greater impact on differentiating one search engine from another. In the next section, we discuss these research findings in greater detail. 6. Discussion
On average, general Chinese language Web search engines support more features than specialized ones. With reference to multimedia data, general Web search engines performed better than specialized Web search engines in retrieving audio, video, image, and news image formats. However, when searching for software, specialized Web search engines performed better. Icons, animations, and mobile phone images were supported by few Web search engines. Physical or logical mixing of multiple basic types and media elements for authoring were not supported. For keyword search, general Web search en-words X  ( Y ), the results were equivalent for both types of search engines.

Features with extreme values shown in the MDS maps, such as Offensive Material Filter, Video Pay-per-download, Soft-ware, and Animation, were not present in many search engines. However, features, such as the Org, Edu, and Gov domains, as well as Moderate, Adult, and Strict filters, were present in many search engines. Finally, the most common features were Images, various file formats, and use of keywords ( X  X  X ll the words X  and  X  X  X anual formula X ).

General Chinese language search engines offered more file size options than specialized ones. The most common file for-mats were supported by both types of Web search engines. However, some Chinese Web search engines offer search items that are uncommon for popular English language search engines, such as karaoke resources, mobile phone ringtones, and media players. Searching Black-and-white (B), Greyscale (G), and Full Color (F) images is not well-supported by search en-gines, with the exception of those in cluster 7. In content taxonomy, features-based (F) search is better supported by both formed better than specialized Web search engines (18%), as can be seen from Table 3 .

The preferred methods for viewing content are through links and thumbnails. The duration of video or audio files is not a feature provided. The advanced multimedia search features supported by specialized Web search engines are: interactive browsing with thumbnail and text summaries; sorting of results by relevance, popularity, and new items added; as well as using of text alternatives such as titles and keywords. However, generally media quality was not applied as a search fea-ture. The special features are hot ranking, multi-language, complex queries, and Boolean calculations.

Many general Chinese Web search engines index Web pages only. However, they provide multimedia Web search func-popular Chinese Web search engine Baidu has 34 specialized Web search engines for different subjects and media types, such as mp3, mobile phone entertainment, maps, government sites, etc. When the user clicks on a link for specialized search, the browser opens a new window. However, the interface and display of search results for each specialized Web search en-gine can be quite different from each other. For example, image.baidu.com gives users further options to browse images in each one with the URL and the title of the page where the image is embedded, and the name of the Website. On the other hand, searching Yellow Pages result in a simple list of companies and their contact information. Similar to some English language Web search engines, Baidu provides advanced search in which users can specify domain, file format, occurrences of key words, currency, etc. Users of Baidu can narrow down their search by searching only the current retrieved sites. 6.1. Limitations
This study provides an overview of the functionalities of Chinese language multimedia search engines. It does not cover the more effective features for retrieving multimedia content on the Web. Our understanding of user behavior and the ways users create Chinese queries are also limited. However, the results of our study provide a window to the rapidly evolving
Chinese web-search environment, where users are relatively young and mainly interested in using the Web for leisure and entertainment. Most of the content that these users demand are in multimedia format. However, as this study shows, the majority of the search engines use keyword-based retrieval methods regardless of the numerous features presented by multimedia resources. 6.2. Implication

Conclusions and further research
The retrieval of multimedia content is a great challenge to all Web search engines, in particular those utilizing non-pho-netic scripts such as the Chinese language. This study has identified the methods used by Chinese language Web search en-game sites). Chinese language Web search engines offer only limited multimedia search functionalities, and keywords are the predominant way to retrieve multimedia content, which indicates the necessity of knowing Chinese written text.
Phonetic queries, image query by example, and spoken queries were not available in the search engines investigated. This
While there are many ongoing research on spoken term detection (Hansen et al., 2005; National Institute of Standard, 2009 ), performance is generally higher with keyword search than phonetic search (Mamou, Ramabhadran, &amp; Siohan, 2007 ). Hence, it is not surprising that commercial search engine companies have not employed such technologies.

The development of Chinese language Web search engines that provide more features for searching multimedia content will generate new trends in Web search. The adoption of these trends will depend on how effectively specialized Web search engines can solve the users X  information needs. Given the complexity of multimedia retrieval and the immaturity of meta-data and voice recognition, text-based search will remain the most popular choice in the near future.

Further research is needed to develop a classification scheme for Chinese language Web search engines. The conventional classification of Web search engines may be inadequate when surveying the landscape of Chinese language Web search en-gines. Baidu has 34 specialized Web search engines that search for Web pages (as a general search engine), and the other individual specialized Web search engines for other media types or content. We anticipate that the popular general Web search engines will eventually provide users with multimedia Web search features and resources due to the entertain-ment-based nature of the Chinese Web usage.

With the awareness of the results claimed by Spink and her co-authors about English language Web search engines; this paper reported the general state of Chinese multimedia Web search engines without providing a direct comparison. The Eng-imately the same period. Moreover, when this study was conducted, the market for Chinese language Web search engines was considerably less developed than the market for English language Web search engines, which adds to difficulties in com-parison. For a deeper understanding of the global search engine advancement, future studies can consider having a mean-ingful comparison with new data to be collected.
