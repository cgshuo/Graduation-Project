 Multimedia Content and the Semantic Web: Methods, Standards and Tools, G. Stamou, S. Kollias (Eds.), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd., West Sussex, England (2005)
In this book, Stamou and Kollias share interesting insights into the Semantic Web by reviewing multimedia content, organizational methods, and its standards. The editors have assembled many interesting authors ad hoc to examine topics such as structured identification in audiovisual documents, object-based video indexing, and speech and image processing methods.

This compilation of authors is one of the first books to introduce multimedia content technology and its tools. The book can be very useful to researchers and developers in the semantic multimedia domain. Analysis of different methodologies can provide ideas to experienced researchers in academia. Various multimedia con-tent organization tools and applications can make this book a useful guide for developers and business organizations.

The book is organized into three parts. Part one and two cover ideas in organizing the Web and multimedia content analysis. Part three introduces multimedia content management tools and semantic web applications. The editors have done a superb job of integrating emerging ideas and grouping related papers into meaningful clusters.

In Part one, Chapter 1, MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 standards are introduced as a layout for representing multimedia and the Semantic Web. MPEG-21 was standardized with users in mind, since its technology relies on description tools. Chapter 2, Ontology Representation and Querying for Realizing Semantics Driven Appli-cations , discusses the representation in ontology, querying methods and implementation. Chapter 3 describes the  X  X hat X  and  X  X ow X  of MPEG-7 standard; the web ontology language to define its semantics; and ways the ontology can be used on the semantic web. The last chapter in Part one is the only chapter authored by the two publishers of the book. It applies fuzzy logic to knowledge-based systems for multimedia analysis and retrieval.
 Part two focuses on fundamental multimedia content analysis technologies in five respective chapters. Chapter 5, Structure Identification in an Audiovisual Documents , presents gathered work on shot-segmentation and its tools. In Chapter 6, entitled Object-based Indexing of Multimedia Contents , the authors examine hetero-geneous data as objects and develop an overview of the trends in object based indexing. Chapter 7 on auto-matic extraction and analysis of visual objects information reviews main concepts of the semantic class model and an algorithm for object detection in images. Chapter 8 introduces a hybrid framework for modeling con-cepts and context using MPEG-7 standards. Chapter 9 is dedicated to graphical models and multimedia understanding in machine learning.
 Five papers on multimedia content managements systems and semantic web applications are grouped in Part three. The authors introduce cases to show how the technology can be adapted to related fields of re-search and business. Chapters 10, 12, and 13 focus on multimedia content indexing and retrieval and technol-ogy specific to speech, texts and image processing methods, Chapters 10, 11, and 14 illustrate cases about systems and applications in academia and business.

Ontology and multimedia content management systems mentioned in this book could serve as part of the digital pathway to the semantic web. However, creating multimedia descriptors and difficulties in standardi-zation are considered persistent issues in organizing multimedia contents. In that sense, introducing more real cases to applied fields would have shed more optimism for readers.
Overall, Stamou and Kollias presented an excellent overview on the current development of multimedia content analysis and semantics. They offered sophisticated and professional information researchers a perspec-tive for organizing multimedia content methods, standards, and tools. Cases from applied fields added to the book would have made this book a more thorough introductory text. Still, this book is written in a deliverable manner suitable for novice readers as well as reference book for academic researchers and developers in the related field. The technologies in this book may serve as connecting the dots between multimedia content man-agement systems and the Semantic Web.
