 This extended abstract presents a new spatial model for collaboratively recommending  X  X ompelling X  comments in an online discussion forum that promote consensus among a diverse group of users. In this application our goal is to pro-mote comments that are rated highly by dissimilar users, which in some sense is a dual to traditional recommender problems. We propose a model for weighting and aggregat-ing comment ratings that gives greater influence to positive ratings from users who tend to disagree with the commenter, and we compare it with various alternate methods. The model has the added benefit of being resistant to manipula-tion by false ratings and sybil attacks.

We test the model on comments in Opinion Space, a new online discussion tool that allows users to visualize where they stand with respect to other users in terms of their opin-ions on a set of controversial propositions. Comments in the system are recommended visually, where more  X  X ompelling X  comments are emphasized with larger sizes.

Many user-generated content sites on the web employ some protocol for managing information that asks users to rate comments, reviews, or story submissions. The ratings for each item are typically averaged to form a ranking [10]. While this is a simple and intuitive method for filtering out weight each rating provided for a comment such that posi-tive opinions from more diverse users have greater influence.
One of the greatest challenges in designing social informa-tion systems is to encourage individuals to behave truthfully and constructively, especially when money is exchanged. Bhat-tacharjee and Goel describe their work towards the design of incentive compatible mechanisms for ranking in [4, 3]. Zhang et al. show how to improve the robustness of eigenvector-based ranking methods against collusion [15].

We seek to design a comment ranking model that is both resistant to manipulation and satisfies certain axioms of fair-ness. Friedman et al. [6] survey recent results in the manipu-lability of reputation systems, and Altman and Tennenholtz [2] lay the foundations for studying ranking systems in an axiomatic way. In [9], Hochbaum models group ranking as a convex optimization problem that minimizes the difference between individual rankings and the final ranking; she shows that it can be solved in polynomial time.

Our comment ranking model builds on boosting theory by treating users as  X  X uman classifiers. X  Polikar details an extensive survey of the literature in [12]. Kuncheva and Whitaker studied measures of classifier diversity in [11], and Garg and Weber reduce the problem of tag recommendation on Flickr to a classification problem in [7].

Opinion Space builds and displays a network of social in-teractions between users. Freeman surveyed the history of visualizing social networks in [5]. In addition to meaningful visualizations, allowing for navigation of the data is key to a successful collaborative system. Heer and Boyd describe the Vizster visualization system in [8], which displays social network users as nodes in a graph and supports visual search and filtering. Visone is another system for visual exploration of social networks that enables more intuitive data analysis by emphasizing interactions with the graphical representa-tion of the network.

The structure of the social networks inherent in online communities can also be exploited to better understand rep-utation, as shown by Sabater and Sierra in [14] and Pujol et al. in [13]. J X sang et al. survey current work on modeling trust and reputation for online transactions in [10].
Several popular websites have implemented different types of reputation and comment filtering models to help users manage information overload. Slashdot, for example, uses a complex human-based moderation and meta-moderation systems to filter out inflammatory or inappropriate com-ments. Although effective, this system is highly inefficient due to the multiple levels of moderation.
New users of Opinion Space are presented with five fixed propositions and asked to rate them on a continuous scale between  X  X trongly disagree X  and  X  X trongly agree. X  The opin-ion profile of each user is projected onto a two-dimensional plane using Principal Component Analysis and data points are plotted in real-time. A user can then visualize her opin-ions with respect to other users, where closer data points indicate higher levels of agreement on the five proposition.
Users are encouraged to submit a comment on a related open-ended discussion topic, which other users can read by clicking on the corresponding point in the Space. Figure 1
Figure 2 visually describes the behavior of the weighting system. The model is continuous as a function of the raw rating in the sense that as the raw rating tends towards 0, so does the transformed rating. On the other hand, the transformed rating can vary drastically as a function of the distance and the sign of the raw rating.
The spatial weighting model computes a weight for each comment rating. To make comment recommendations, we require a method for aggregating the transformed ratings of each comment in the form of an ordered global ranking. Further, because we are weighting ratings according to how valuable they are towards finding a consensus, we require any ranking method to be monotonic, as defined below.
Definition 1. A ranking function is monotonic if a pos-itive rating can never decrease the rank of a comment, and a negative rating can never improve the rank of a comment.
Under the requirement for monotonicity, we propose the following mathematical definition for compelling comments.
Definition 2. Comment a is said to be strictly more com-pelling than comment b if Informally, a compelling comment is one that gets a high level of approval from a diverse set of participants as opposed to only users with similar opinions.

Monotonicity does not hold if we let the rank of a comment be the average of the weighted ratings for the comment. Instead, we propose to use the in-degree model, defined in the weighted sense as follows. Let c max = max j | P i r 0 i,j | be the greatest magnitude sum of weighted ratings for a single comment. Then the rank of comment k is given by
For the remainder of this paper, we refer the the spatial comment ranking method as the in-degree computed on the ratings transformed by the spatial weighting model.
We now briefly discuss the ability of our spatial comment ranking model to resist two common forms of manipulation.
Eliciting truthful feedback is one of the greatest chal-lenges faced by Opinion Space and general discussion fo-rums. While in most cases it is impossible to prevent false ratings [6], our spatial ranking model is able to resist it by introducing the following tradeoff. If a user wants to have the maximum impact when rating similar users highly, she would be forced to misrepresent her ratings of the five propo-sitions; hence, a user cannot rate the propositions truthfully and inflate a neighbor X  X  ranking at the same time. cardinality 1 Table 1: Pairwise correlation between rankings pro-duced by the spatial comment ranking model and the mean, in-degree, and cardinality models.
As of May 5, 2009 Opinion Space has collected over 11,000 ratings of 1,200 comments. In this data set, ratings are given on a continuous scale between 0 and 1, where anything less than 0.5 is considered to be a  X  X egative X  rating. We find that on average, users who rated a comment highly (  X  0 . 8) were 16% closer to the commenter than individuals who rated a comment poorly (  X  0 . 2).

Figure 3(a) is a histogram of the raw ratings. A significant number of the ratings are either 0 or 1, and we observe that the positive ratings between [0.5, 1) are slightly more skewed towards the center while negative ratings between (0, 0.5] are more evenly distributed. There are also twice as many ratings of 0 as 1, indicating that the barrier to entry for getting a good rating is much higher than for a poor rating.
Figure 3(b) is a histogram of the comment ratings trans-formed by the spatial model. This distribution is shaped like a bell curve centered around 0, which is almost the in-verse of the raw ratings distribution. We are therefore able to get a significantly increased level of definition along both extremes.

We have proposed a spatial model for transforming com-ment ratings and aggregating them into a global comment ranking in such a way that is monotonic and promotes what we define as valuable behavior. We evaluate our spatial comment ranking method against three alternative ranking methods computed on the raw (non-transformed) comment ratings: 1) mean comment rating, 2) weighted in-degree, and 3) cardinality or number of ratings. The first step is to compute the cardinal rank of every comment collected with Opinion Space according to each method. We then com-pare the Pearson correlation between the resulting ranking vectors for each pair of methods.

The pairwise correlations between the different comment ranking methods are described in Table 1. We found that in-degree has fairly high correlation with the number of rat-ings received for the comment, suggesting that it is biased towards comments with higher cardinality. In contrast, our spatial comment ranking method is the only method studied that is both monotonic and not biased by cardinality.
The next major step in this work is to extend the spatial comment ranking model to make personalized comment rec-ommendations. This may be done using a new polynomial-time localized clustering algorithm that we are developing (paper pending), and we will compare its performance against other collaborative filtering algorithms.

Our ultimate goal is to create a personalized comment recommender system that is efficient, resistant to manipula-tion, and satisfies certain axioms of fairness. Hence, we will
