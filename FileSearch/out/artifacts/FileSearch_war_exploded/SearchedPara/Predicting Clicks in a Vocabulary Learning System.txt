 When reading an article one occasionally encoun-ters an unknown word for which one would like the definition. For students learning or mastering a language, this can occur frequently. Using a com-puterized learning system, it is possible to high-light words with which one would expect students to struggle. The highlighting both draws attention to the word and indicates that information about it is available.

There are many applications of automatically highlighting unknown words. The first is, obviously, educational applications. Another application is for-eign language acquisition. Traditionally learners of foreign languages have had to look up unknown words in a dictionary. For reading on the computer, unknown words are generally entered into an online dictionary, which can be time-consuming. The au-tomated highlighting of words could also be applied in an online encyclopedia, such as Wikipedia. The proliferation of handheld computer devices for read-ing is another potential application, as some of these user interfaces may cause difficulty in the copying and pasting of a word into a dictionary. Given a fi-nite amount of resources available to improve defi-nitions for certain words, knowing which words are likely to be clicked will help. This can be used for caching.

In this paper, we explore applying machine learn-ing algorithms to classifying clicks in a vocabulary learning system. The primary contribution of this work is to provide a list of features for machine learning algorithms and their correlation with clicks. We analyze how the different features correlate with different aspects of the vocabulary learning process. The previous work done in this area has mainly been in the area of predicting clicks for web search rank-ing. For search engine results, there have been sev-eral factors identified for why people click on cer-tain results over others. One of the most impor-tant is position bias, which says that the presenta-tion order affects the probability of a user clicking on a result. This is considered a  X  X undamental prob-lem in click data X  (Craswell et al., 2008), and eye-tracking experiments (Joachims et al., 2005) have shown that click probability decays faster than ex-amination probability.

There have been four hypotheses for how to model position bias:  X   X   X   X  The cascade model has been shown to closely model the top-ranked results and the baseline model closely matches how users click at lower-ranked results (Craswell et al., 2008).

There has also been work done in predicting doc-ument keywords (Do  X gan and Lu, 2010). Their ap-proach is similar in that they use machine learning to recognize words that are important to a document. Our goals are complimentary, in that they are trying to predict words that a user would use to search for a document and we are trying to predict words in a document that a user would want more information about. We revisit the comparison later in our discus-sion. To obtain click data, a study was conducted involv-ing middle-school students, of which 157 were in the 7th grade and 17 were in the 8th grade. 90 stu-dents spoke Spanish as their primary language, 75 spoke English as their primary language, 8 spoke other languages and 1 was unknown. There were six documents for which we obtained click data. Each document was either about science or was a fable. The science documents contained more advanced vocabulary whereas the fables were primarily writ-ten for English language learners. In the study, the students took a vocabulary test, used the vocabu-lary system and then took another vocabulary test with the same words. The highlighted words were chosen by a computer program using latent seman-tic analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990) and those re-sults were then manually edited by educators. The words were highlighted identically for each student. Importantly, only nouns were highlighted and only nouns were in the vocabulary test. When the student clicked on a highlighted word, they were shown def-initions for the word along with four images show-ing the word in context. For example, if a student clicked on the word  X  X rane X  which had the word  X  X lying X  next to it, one of the images the student would see would be of a flying crane. From Fig-ure 1 we see that there is a relation between the total number of words in a document and the number of clicks students made.
It should be noted that there is a large class imbal-ance in the data. For every click in document four, there are about 30 non-clicks. The situation is even more imbalanced for the science documents. For the second science document there are 100 non-clicks for every click and for the first science document there are nearly 300 non-clicks for every click.
There was also no correlation seen between a word being on a quiz and being clicked. This indi-cates that the students may not have used the system as seriously as possible and introduced noise into the click data. This is further evidenced by the quizzes, which show that only about 10% of the quiz words that students got wrong on the first test were actually learned. However, we will show that we are able to predict clicks regardless.

Figure 2, 3 and 4 show the relationship between the mean age of acquisition of the words clicked on, STAR language scores and the number of clicks for document 2. A second-degree polynomial was fit to the data for each figure. Students with STAR lan-guage scores above 300 are considered to have ba-sic ability, above 350 are proficient and above 400 are advanced. Age of acquisition scores are abstract and a score of 300 means a word was acquired at 4-6, 400 is 6-8 and 500 is 8-10 (Cortese and Fugett, 2004). The goal of our study is to predict student clicks in a vocabulary learning system. We used the random forest machine learning method, due to its success in the Yahoo! Learning to Rank Challenge (Chapelle and Chang, 2011). This algorithm was tested using the Weka (Hall et al., 2009) machine learning soft-ware with the default settings.

Random forest is an algorithm that classifies data by decision trees voting on a classification (Breiman, 2001). The forest chooses the class with the most
Figure 4. Age of Acquisition vs STAR Language votes. Each tree in the forest is trained by first sam-pling a subset of the data, chosen randomly with replacement, and then removing a large number of features. The number of samples chosen is the same number as in the original dataset, which usually re-sults in about one-third of the original dataset left out of the training set. The tree is unpruned. Ran-dom forest has the advantage that it does not overfit the data.

To implement this algorithm on our click data, we constructed feature vectors consisting of both stu-dent features and word features. Each word is either clicked or not clicked, so we were able to use a bi-nary classifier. 5.1 Features To run our machine learning algorithms, we needed features for them. The features used are of two types: student features and word features. The stu-dent features we used in our experiment were the STAR (Standardized Testing and Reporting, a Cal-ifornia standardized test) language score and the CELDT (California English Language Development Test) overall score, which correlated highly with each other. There was a correlation of about -0.1 between the STAR language score and total clicks across all the documents. Also available were the STAR math score, CELDT reading, writing, speak-ing and listening scores, grade level and primary lan-guage. These did not improve results and were not included in the experiment.

We used and tested many word features, which were discovered to be more important than the stu-dent features. First, we used the part-of-speech as a feature which was useful since only nouns were highlighted in the study. The part-of-speech tagger we used was the Stanford Log-linear Part-of-Speech Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). Second, various psycholinguistic variables were obtained from five studies (Wilson, 1988; Bird et al., 2001; Cortese and Fugett, 2004; Stadthagen-Gonzalez and Davis, 2006; Cortese and Khanna, 2008). The most use-ful was age of acquisition, which refers to  X  X he age at which a word was learnt and has been proposed as a significant contributor to language and memory processes X  (Stadthagen-Gonzalez and Davis, 2006). This was useful because it was available for the ma-jority of words and is a good proxy for the difficulty of a word. Also useful was imageability, which is  X  X he ease with which the word gives rise to a sen-sory mental image X  (Bird et al., 2001). For ex-ample, these words are listed in decreasing order of imageability: beach, vest, dirt, plea, equanimity. Third, we obtained the Google unigram frequencies which were also a proxy for the difficulty of a word. Fourth, we calculated click percentages for words, students and words, words in a document and spe-cific words in a document. While these features cor-related very highly with clicks, we did not include these in our experiment. We instead would like to focus on words for which we do not have click data. Fifth, the word position, which indicates the position of the word in the document, was useful because po-sition bias was seen in our data. Also important was the word instance, e.g. whether the word is the first, second, third, etc. time appearing in the document. After seeing a word three or four times, the clicks for that word dropped off dramatically.

There were also some other features that seemed interesting but ultimately proved not useful. We gathered etymological data, such as the language of origin and the date the word entered the English lan-guage; however these features did not help. We were also able to categorize the words using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), which can determine, for exam-ple, that a boat is an artifact and a lion is an animal. We tested for the categories of abstraction, artifact, living thing and animal but found no correlation be-tween clicks and these categories. 5.2 Missing Values Many features were not available for every word in the evaluation, such as age of acquisition. We could guess a value from available data, called imputation, or create separate models for each unique pattern of missing features, called reduced-feature models. We decided to create reduced feature models due to them being reported to consistently outperform im-putation (Saar-Tsechansky and Provost, 2007). 5.3 Experimental Set-up We ran our evaluation on document four, which had click data for 22 students. We chose this docu-ment because it had the highest correlation between a word being a quiz word and clicked, at 0.06, and the correlation between the age of acquisition of a word and that word being a quiz word is high, at 0.58.

The algorithms were run with the following fea-tures: STAR language score, CELDT overall score, word position, word instance, document number, age of acquisition, imageability, Google frequency, stopword, and part-of-speech. We did not include the science text data as training data. The training data for a student consisted of his or her click data for the other fables and all the other students X  click data for all the fables. 5.4 Results From Figure 2 we see the performance of random forest. We obtained similar performance with the other documents except document one. We also note that we also used a bayesian network and multi-boosting in Weka and obtained similar performance to random forest. There are several important issues to consider when interpreting these results. First, we are trying to maximize clicks when we should be trying to max-imize learning. In the future we would like to iden-tify which clicks are more important than others and incorporate that into our model. Second, across all documents of the study there was no correlation be-tween a word being on the quiz and being clicked. We would like to obtain click data from users ac-tively trying to learn and see how the results would be affected and we speculate that the position bias effect may be reduced in this case. Third, this study involved students who were using the system for the first time. How these results translate to long-term use of the program is unknown.

The science texts are a challenge for the classifiers for several reasons. First, due to the relationship be-tween a document X  X  length and the number of clicks, there are relatively few words clicked. Second, in the study most of the more difficult words were not highlighted. This actually produced a slight negative correlation between age of acquisition and whether the word is a quiz word or not, whereas for the fa-ble documents there is a strong positive correlation between these two variables. It raises the question of how appropriate it is to include click data from a document with only one click out of 100 or 300 non-clicks into the training set for a document with one click out of 30 non-clicks. When the science documents were included in the training set for the fables, there was no difference in performance.
The correlation between the word position and clicks is about -0.1. This shows that position bias affects vocabulary systems as well as search engines and finding a good model to describe this is future work. The cascade model seems most appropri-ate, however the students tended to click in a non-linear order. It remains to be seen whether this non-linearity holds for other populations of users.
Previous work by Do  X gan and Lu in predicting click-words (Do  X gan and Lu, 2010) built a learning system to predict click-words for documents in the field of bioinformatics. They claim that  X  X ur results show that a word X  X  semantic type, location, POS, neighboring words and phrase information together could best determine if a word will be a click-word. X  They did report that if a word was in the title or ab-stract it was more likely to be a click-word, which is similar to our finding that a word at the beginning of the document is more likely to be clicked. However, it is not clear whether there is one underlying cause for both of these. Certain features such as neigh-boring words do not seem applicable to our usage in general, although it is something to be aware of for specialized domains. Their use of semantic types was interesting, though using WordNet we did not find any preference for certain classes of nouns be-ing clicked over others.
