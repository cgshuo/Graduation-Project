 1. Introduction
Information retrieval can be a daunting task, particularly for the non-expert in a technical subject do-main such as medicine or law. The user usually has little assistance in selecting the words or phrases that express the desired information. In such cases, user guidance is necessary if the search is to be successful.
Decision support can assist the user by providing guidance in identifying the key information desired, selecting terms, providing an interface between the user and the search engine, and determining the optimal mix of search terms that yields the desired information. The user needs guidance if the search is to be successful, and support can be provided in an automated fashion. This paper suggests a novel approach referred to as a Convergent Search to improve decision making during a user  X  s Web-based search for tech-nical information by implementing the analytic hierarchy process with intelligent software agents that aid the search. The method is compared to a Divergent Search for information in which the user is not aided.
The possible improvement in search results is demonstrated with an application from telemedicine using a controlled vocabulary. 1.1. Decision making support
Decision making  X  X  X s a process of choosing among alternative courses of action for the purpose of attain-or unstructured. Structured tasks are those in which the methods and information needed for decision mak-ing are completely known. Unstructured tasks are those that cannot be described by general principles.
Those tasks between the two extremes are called semi-structured and are the most relevant for decision making support systems. The user benefits from guidance and general principles, and uses these to make an individual selection. Searching for information can be classified as a semi-structured task, particularly in a highly technical field with specialized vocabulary. During the search, the user moves through Simon  X  s (1977) classical model of the major phases of decision making as shown in Table 1 .

The implementation is then checked against reality and may be revised or refined. The process is contin-uous, the phases may overlap and the decision maker may loop back to a previous phase. Although some steps may be performed concurrently, decision making is fundamentally a sequential process with design requiring intelligence, choice needing design and implementation following choice ( Forgionne, 1991 ). These steps are repeated iteratively with many feedback loops until the final choice has been implemented. As with other types of problems, decision support during a search (decision making) can facilitate the process. The search process has been described as an interaction between the user, the information space and the inter-face ( Wang, Hawk, &amp; Tenopir, 2000 ). This paper offers a methodology for rendering decision support by providing an interface to an information space described by a controlled vocabulary.

The paper is organized as follows. We first review search strategies used by current Web-based search engines. We then discuss the technical field related to our application and methods that are used to provide decision support. We propose a decision support system that provides an individual search for an individ-ual category of user at a point in time. Finally, we discuss relevance to the practitioner and contributions to the literature. 1.2. Search engines
There are a number of engines available to help information seekers perform the search process. They can be classified as Web search engines and technical search models. 1.2.1. Web search engines
Web search engines categorize and rank pages on the web for users that define search terms. The results are based on the principle of democratic  X  X  X otes X  X  in the case of web crawlers ( Google, 2004 ) or content clas-sification in the case of human-powered searches ( Open Directory, 2004; SearchEngineWatch, 2004 ).
One method of classifying Web search engines is based on the way in which sites are cataloged. Using this distinction, search engines can be classified as either crawler based or human powered. Several of the major search engines are summarized in Table 2 . Crawler-based search engines, such as Google, use soft-ware to automatically crawl or spider the web and create indices that are used to perform a search. Changes are recorded as pages are re-examined over time. Web administrators have the option of excluding pages from a crawler using the Robots Exclusion Protocol (2004) . Human-powered search engines, such as Open
Directory, rely on humans to catalog sites that are submitted for review. Some engines are used to power parts of other engines.

The search occurs by presenting a text box to the user. The user types the words for the search, and the search engine responds by providing a list of potential sources usually ranked by relevance as defined by the search engine. Since the search engine does not provide assistance to the user in the selection of terms, other than perhaps a prompting for spelling errors, we may call this method an unaided search. Experienced users navigate by reviewing links within the top several pages and redefining the search terms, moving from a coarse-grained analysis to a finer grain, while novices use a trial-and-error approach ( Tabatabai &amp; Luconi, 1998 ). The success of web engines such as Google attests to the value of defining relevance for most users in terms of democratic voting as suggested by linkages between web pages ( Google, 2004 ). The effect is that the user is directed to pages that are most likely associated with his/her search terms as defined by the pop-ulation of web users. In the case of generalized searches in which the user has some knowledge of terms associated with the desired information, this approach has a high likelihood of success. 1.2.2. Technical search
In technical fields, the user may have little or no experience with the relevant search terms. An example of a technical field with specialized vocabulary is medicine. Medical information and data is captured, for example, in Web-accessible databases at the National Library of Medicine ( NLM, 2003 ). Table 3 gives an overview of these databases.

Rather than a web crawler or human-powered search, the primary search terms are defined by the Med-ical Subject Headings ( MeSH  X  ) controlled vocabulary containing over 19,000 terms ( NLM, 2004 ). Biomed-ical subject specialists with degrees in science who are also experts in one of more foreign languages create the MeSH  X  terms, and complete articles are reviewed rather than abstracts. Chemical specialists add about 7000 new mostly chemical concepts to the MeSH  X  headings each year to provide for changing content ( NLM, 2004 ).

In this environment, the non-technical user seldom is aware of the controlled vocabulary for search terms defined by the MeSH  X  and may have little or no experience with terms specific to a medical specialist dealing with the topic of interest. NLM provides a generalized search engine similar to the presentation of
Google as shown in Fig. 1 . However, the process of selecting terms may not be obvious to the user in this existing system. The user needs support to help construct a successful search with a controlled vocabulary, and we propose a process called a Convergent, or aided, search. Other researchers have addressed aided searches in the case of non-controlled vocabularies using techniques such as clustering and visualization ( Turetken &amp; Sharda, 2001 ), presenting non-confirmatory information ( Jacobs &amp; Kelm, 1988 ) and recom-mendation agents ( Wan, Menon, &amp; Ramaprasad, 2003 ).
 2. Application
The decision problem for a non-expert searching a technical field accessible through a controlled vocab-ulary is shown within an evolving Web site called the Preventing Suicide Network ( PSN, 2004 ). Fig. 2 shows the home page for this site.

The PSN is intended for users referred to as intermediaries, that is, third-party observers who are con-cerned about people who may be suicidal. The site is linked to information both internal to the site (referred to as internal databases and cataloged with Google) and externally through the seven databases at NLM in
Table 3 ( NLM, 2004 ) that are of potential interest to the PSN users. The scope of the external databases is demonstrated by the over 12 million references in MedLine alone ( NLM, 2004 ). 2.1. Divergent search
The initial attempt to provide an aided search in the PSN used a list of 81 terms in six categories, includ-ing the header terms shown in Table 4 , provided by a professional clinician in consultation with medical experts in the subject field of suicide ( PSN, 2004 ). Suggested terms were evaluated by the experts with re-spect to the MeSH  X  terms and selected for inclusion. They were presented to the user as checkboxes as shown in Fig. 3 . In some cases, the terms actually sent to the search engine were different from those pre-sented to the user to more closely match the MeSH  X  terms. For example, the term  X  X  X amily and physiopa-thology X  X  is used for the database search rather than  X  X  X amily dysfunction X  X  as shown to the user ( PSN, 2004 ). All search terms contained the word  X  X  X uicide. X  X 
We refer to the search as divergent since the user adds terms to the search (diverges from the initial search) by selecting additional terms. Analysis of the number of returns from a divergent search yielded unexpected results.

Statistics were calculated for searches to PubMed that simulate users selecting, successively, one term, two terms, three terms, four terms, or five terms. The statistics for one, two and three chosen terms were derived by testing all possible combinations of terms and recording the number of returns provided by Pub-
Med. Due to the large number of combinations for more than three terms, the statistics for four, five and six terms were approximated from a random sample of 10,000 combinations without replacement. That is, the simulation consisted of 10,000 unique iterations of each of are shown in Table 5 .

As the table shows, the maximum number of items retrieved decreases with the addition of more terms as would be expected. The average number of returns decreases from 1888.9 for one term to essentially 0 for six terms. Thus, as the user selects additional terms to define the topics of interest, the probability that he/ she will identify relevant information decreases rapidly. As an example of a two-term search, the words  X  X  X ggression + clergy X  X  yield 0 returns in all databases. Although it was expected that the number of returns would decrease with the addition of more terms to tailor the search, it was not expected that the number of returns would drop to zero so quickly. The search results were unanticipated, yielding a probability of 0.94 for zero returns at four terms out of the original 81.

The reason for the result is apparent by examining Fig. 4 . This figure shows the variability associated with one-word search terms for the application. The number of returns for just one term (plus the word  X  X  X uicide X  X ) range from 0 to 17215, with about half of the terms yielding a relatively low response. Although some terms yielded zero returns, the domain subject experts wanted terms to be available for expected fu-ture research. Since the selection of additional terms from the same set of 81 terms sends more search terms conjoined by AND to the search engine, the probability of 0 returns increases and becomes higher with each additional selection.

Although the user is aided in the selection of search terms by the presentation of potential terminology in non-technical language, the user needs guidance in the selection of terms that will provide a successful search while representing the user  X  s individual needs. In addition, since the user  X  s preferences may change over time, the support should be dynamic in nature. These requirements led to a proposed support method that was called the Convergent Search.
 2.2. Convergent search
Divergent Search presented 81 terms in a check list format, and the statistics suggested that the user would likely receive 0 returns if the number of terms selected was more than three. Thus, it is desirable to assist the user in delineating the characteristics of the desired information leading to improved perfor-mance in retrieval. The proposed aided search is called a Convergent Search, since the selection of terms is focused and filtered. We suggest that the analytic hierarchy process (AHP; Saaty, 1980, 1990 ) is well sui-ted as a methodology for this task.

The AHP is a multi-criteria decision technique that can be utilized to ascertain user information needs and to prioritize user preferences. The AHP provides a logical and scientific basis to decision making in which pairwise comparisons of components are made by the user with respect to a common goal or criteria ( Harker, 1988 ). The decision problem is structured as a hierarchy of criteria, subcriteria and alternatives, with the num-ber of levels being determined by the problem. Once the hierarchy is established, the alternatives are evalu-wise comparisons, the process generates convergence to the most relevant search terms for the particular searcher. The AHP is widely used in individual and group decision making scenarios ( Bolloju, 2001 ). An example of the AHP applied to information retrieval for the suicide prevention case is illustrated in
Fig. 5 .In Fig. 5  X  s example, the user identified the categories of Gender and Associated Factors from Fig. 3  X  s presentation to describe the desired information. Within each category, the user utilizes the AHP to provide a qualitative description of the relative importance of each pair of elements within the category at the lowest level. For example, within the gender category, the user would be asked to rate  X  X  X ale X  X  versus  X  X  X emale X  X  in terms of importance to the user  X  s search. Similar pairwise comparisons would be made for each gender descriptor. Using mathematical procedures involving eigenvalues, the AHP method derives the implied weights to assign each descriptor within the gender category ( Saaty, 1980 ). A similar analysis is used to de-rive weights for the Associated Factors category. Pairwise comparisons of the category characteristics then will lead to a weighted value for the target information. The weighted value would be analogous to a  X  X  X it rate X  X . Similar values for other target information would be derived analogously. By comparing values for the various targets, the searcher then would have some guidance on the target information best suited to her/his needs.

As an illustration, the AHP model in Fig. 5 was implemented in Expert Choice (2004) software as shown in Fig. 6 . One of the advantages to using the AHP method is that the user is presented with the criteria in pairs and asked to rate the relative importance compared to each other. This focusing of information guides the user in the selection of search terms that describe the desired information.

For example, suppose that a user is a family member as their intermediary role. The user has a male rel-ative who has a chronic illness, is depressed, sometimes aggressive and appears to have lost hope. The user is concerned that the relative may be suicidal and visits the PSN site to gain information. Using the model shown in Fig. 5 , the user rates the terms in pairs as shown in Tables 6 X 8 in the following manner. The AHP implemented in Expert Choice (2004) presents each pair in the model, and the user is asked to rate how important the first choice (shown on the left in the table) is compared to the second choice (shown across the top of the table) on a scale of 9.0 (indicated with the parentheses) to +9.0. Under the objective Gen-der, the user selects the relative comparisons shown in Table 6 ; under the objective Associated Factors the user makes the comparisons shown in Table 7 ; under the goal to  X  X  X hoose search terms for relevant health-care information X  X  the user makes the comparisons shown in Table 8 . These comparisons are reflected in the weights shown in Fig. 6 . The sum of the weights on any level is equal to one, and the values indicate the relative importance of the factor. As can be seen under Gender,  X  male  X  is rated as most important with a value of 0.722. Under Associated Factors,  X  depressive disorder  X  is most important with a value of 0.482 fol-lowed by  X  chronic illness  X  with a value of 0.278. Comparing at the next level, the category of Associated
Factors is more important than Gender with a value of 0.882 compared to 0.118. The AHP focuses the information search on the two terms of  X  depressive disorder  X  and  X  chronic illness  X  . Decision making about the search terms is assisted, and the process is convergent in the sense that the user is guided to the essential information needed with a higher probability of obtaining a non-zero number of returns.

A direct comparison of the two search strategies, Divergent compared to Convergent Searches, can be accomplished with similar AHP methodologies, using the goal to  X  X  X ind the best search method. X  X  In the example shown previously, the model in Fig. 5 is used with alternatives Divergent Search and Convergent Search, as shown in Table 9 . The comparisons now display how much more important each factor is in the
Divergent Search compared to the Convergent Search. The user has determined that the search will focus concern in the Convergent Search, and the relative importance of those factors is shown in Table 9  X  s pref-erences. In the Convergent Search, Associated Factors are weighted as 2.5 times more important than Gen-der with respect to the goal. Finally, the pairwise comparisons of the terms under Gender are set as Male and Female, each 2 times as important as Transgender, and the terms under Associated Factors are equally important. The model is synthesized and yields a value of 0.6 for the Convergent Search compared to a value of 0.4 for the Divergent Search, indicating that the Convergent Search provides an improvement in the search for information.

Implementing the search methodology, a Divergent Search with the search terms  X  X  X ale, depressive disorder, aggressive behavior, chronic illness, feelings of hopelessness X  X  yielded 0 returns. Using the AHP model for a Convergent Search as illustrated previously with the revised search terms of  X  depressive disor-der  X  and  X  chronic illness  X  the user obtained 81 returned items. These results demonstrate that the Convergent
Search successfully assisted the user in locating the desired technical information. 3. Information system support
A Convergent Search can be delivered to the searcher transparently through an AHP-based decision support system (DSS). The DSS provides a user-friendly way for guided user search ( Holsapple &amp; Whin-ston, 1996 ). The system assists the user in focusing and filtering the search, increasing the likelihood of success. 3.1. Decision support system for search strategy
The conceptual architecture of the DSS is illustrated in Fig. 7 . The inputs of the DSS are a database and a modelbase. The database contains the search terms, the user preferences, the NLM external data-bases and the internal databases for the PSN site. The modelbase contains the AHP methodology. The processing component organizes the data into a matrix format for the search terms, and operationalizes the AHP model by presenting the comparisons to the user for his/her subjective judgment of the impor-tance of each term selected from the list of search terms. The user would be guided to focus the search.
The outputs are a status report to show the comparison of search terms and a forecast of the results for different combinations of the search terms selected by the user. The recommended action is a prioritized list of search terms. The user is the person who is searching for information in the PSN site, and the computer technology is a microcomputer/PC with a Windows 98 or NT OS or higher, and a monitor.
The AHP software is available from Expert Choice (2004) . Feedback loops within the DSS provide for timely information and rapid response to changes, thereby promoting dynamic searching. The envi-ronment of the search is expected to be dynamic and rapidly-changing as the user refines the search and makes changes in preferences.
 3.2. Implementation
It is desirable to maintain system control with the user, since he/she must perform the pairwise compar-isons to define the search. However, implementation can be accomplished using intelligent agents to assist the system user with the technical tasks involved in the AHP implementation. Intelligent agents can be ben-eficial to users of decision support systems by automating some tasks and reducing complexity ( Hess, Rees, &amp; Rakes, 2000 ). Such agents are software packages that autonomously perform tasks for human users, business processes, workflows or applications ( Bradshaw, 1997; Huhns &amp; Singh, 1998; Jennings &amp; Wool-ridge, 1998 ). Some of the applications in decision support are shown in Table 10 . The applications range from medical care to business decisions.

In the PSN application, intelligent agents could be used to query the user for information and guide the user during the decision making process. Agents would collect the responses and develop a profile of the user  X  s description of the desired information. Agents then would retrieve information from the database, weight and filter the information according to the user  X  s profile, and return the desired information to the user. This added intelligence provides a pragmatic and easy-to-use implementation of the aided search process. 4. Conclusions, contributions and limitations
An approach for an information search by a non-expert operating within a technical field with special-ized terminology is presented. Each individual user requires assistance in focusing the search specific to his/ her individualized needs dynamically at a given point in time. A new decision support system is presented that can be implemented with intelligent software agents and used by researchers and practitioners in tech-nical fields searching for information. The methodology is called a Convergent, or Aided, Search since it assists the user to focus and filter the search.

The paper makes the following contributions to the literature. The paper demonstrates: (1) the need for aided searching, particularly in fields with specialized terminology; (2) that aided searching can be accomplished using the analytic hierarchy process; (3) that the analytic hierarchy process can be delivered through a decision support system; (4) the structure of a decision support system, including the user  X  s control over the entire process, and the
The limitations of the work are that the methodology has been applied to a single domain of suicide pre-vention information as implemented in the Preventing Suicide Network application. There is clearly a need for further testing and application beyond the PSN. Design issues have not been considered such as the interface to the user, and the system has not been tested.

The methodology, especially delivered through decision support systems, or intelligent decision sup-port system with agents, has the potential to revolutionalize search strategies, not just for technical tasks but information searching in general. It is particularly applicable to Web-based searches since the deci-sion support system could be delivered via a Web interface to elicit user input and to interact with the user.
