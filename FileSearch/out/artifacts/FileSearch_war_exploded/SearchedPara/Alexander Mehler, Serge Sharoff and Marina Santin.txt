 Michael Oakes 1 Introduction This comprehensive book makes many original contributions to the field of genres on the web. The identification and characterization of genres is of obvious interest to  X  X  X ure X  X  linguistics, but as this book makes clear, there are some important practical applications. Chief amongst these will be the advent of genre-aware search engines, where users will be able to specify not only their topics of interest, but the desired genre of the returned web pages, as in the WEGA search engine described in this book by Stein et al. Crowston et al. give the example of someone wishing to buy a digital camera. A traditional search engine would return pages on the topic of the specified brand of digital cameras, most of which will just be the web sites of sellers. But what the buyer really wants is information about this type of camera in certain genres only, such as product reviews and opinion-bearing blogs, which provide the opinions of people who have already bought that camera. The idea of genre-aware search engines is already commercially viable, as shown by Google Scholar and Google News, but existing systems tend to work for only one genre. What is needed is search engines which can cope with the entire likely range (or  X  X  X alette X  X ) of genres that the users might ask for.

This is not a text book on the construction of standard search engines, but tells you everything you need to know (or at least, how to find out what you need to know) additional to this to make the search engine aware of genre. The book shows how such search engines would move beyond the  X  X  X ag of words X  X  model traditionally used, to include more linguistically-motivated features, aspects of the visual layout, analysis of the links between web pages, and the relationships between the writers and readers of material on the web.

There is no universally-agreed definition of  X  X  X enre X  X . Kim and Ross describe genres in terms of  X  X  X orms of dissemination X  X , such as scientific papers, emails, blogs, news reports, FAQ pages, job descriptions, editorials, and reportage. Other examples of genres are calls for papers, sitemaps, job descriptions, CVs, syllabuses, and eshops, where e-shops are an example of a newly emerged genre on the web. Several authors use an  X  X  X thnographic X  X  definition (see the chapter by Paolillo et al.), where writers and readers create shared expectations about the form and content of the pages. Writing is made easier since the writer knows what the readers expect, and the cogntive burden of reading and understanding is lessened since the readers know what they are looking for. Thus Karlgren states that genre is  X  X  X  form of implicit agreement between readership and authorship X  X , bringing them closer together. Stein et al. say that genre provides information related to the document X  X  form, purpose, and intended audience.

Other applications will include security, since we can ask whether email spam filters, email hoaxes and cyberbullying are forms of genres. For the teaching of English for Special Purposes, automatic classifiers will be able to gather real-life examples of genres for teaching materials. Automatic summarization algorithms can be tailored for different genres X  X or example, a product review could be expected to contain price and features, and a movie review summary would try to identify actors and the duration of the film.
 Another theme running through the book asks why genre is different on the web. For example, the huge size of the web as a corpus makes it difficult to annotate manually. There is also a skew on the web due to absence of copyrighted work. Some file types are easier to handle than others X  X or example stripping text from HTML is easier than from PDF or Flash. HTML has rich mark-up including text internal hyperlinks and explicit formatting of headings, lists and tables X  X hich are all clues to genre. New genres evolve on the web and old genres disappear when they mutate or go out of fashion. Special techniques are needed for the building of web-derived corpora, such as the crawling and assessment of retrieved pages, or the retrieval of relevant pages from a search engine, where for example a query consisting of specialized medical terms will distinguish academic articles from approved patient leaflets and unsubstantiated plugs for alternative remedies. The introduction to the book also discusses the extent to which well-known (non-web) corpora are already encoded for genre.

After the introduction, which covers the state of the art in genre research, the book is usefully subdivided into thematic sections. Part 2,  X  X  X dentifying the sources of web genres X  X  asks what genres are out there and how do we find them? An example of a genre palette is Amazon UK X  X   X  X  X rowse Genre X  X  facility. Once we have identified a sufficiently broad  X  X  X alette X  X  of genres, we can go on to the task of Part 3,  X  X  X utomatic Genre Identification X  X  (AGI), the automatic classification of new documents to the most appropriate member of the palette we are working with. The first main part of this task is feature selection, where the documents are characterised by their content: words, other linguistic features such as parts of speech, and non-lingusitic features such as the area occupied by images. The second main part often involves machine learning, where the machine learns which features are associated with which genres until it is able to automatically classify documents it has not encountered before. AGI means that web pages can be metatagged with genre labels, which can then be picked up by search engines. Part 4,  X  X  X tructure oriented models of web genres X  X  considers other ways of finding characteristic features of genres, especially the patterns of linkage between different web pages of a particular genre. This section touches upon the more mathematical areas of graph theory and webometrics. Part 5,  X  X  X ase studies of web genres X  X , contains detailed studies of some of the diverse genres on the web. Finally, the section entitled  X  X  X rospect X  X  sets out ideas for future research directions. 2 Identifying the sources of web genres In Chapter 2, Karlgren presents ways of finding out which genres exist on the web, starting with the use of questionnaires X  X imply asking people which genres they are aware of. He compares a set of responses made back in 1998 with those obtained in 2008. There were many similarities, but newer genres included social networking sites and shopping sites. Also, pages which were static now have temporal and dynamic qualities, and there are now fewer purely technical topics. His other ways of finding which genres exist were to look how categories in the Yahoo! Directory have also changed between 2000 and 2008, and by analyzing search engine query logs. The user X  X  desired genre can be inferred from these queries once we have collected a set of implicitly genre-bearing terms such as  X  X  X ecipe X  X  and  X  X  X yrics X  X . The results showed that users frequently are interested in genre, even though current search engines do not allow for a user X  X  desire for a particular genre to be expressed explicitly.

In Chapter 3, Rosso and Haas discuss how right genre could have  X  X  X he capacity to include or exclude certain types of web pages X  X  from retrieval by a search engine. This could take place either at the search query formulation stage (if the users specify that they want only one genre, the engine need only search for pages of that genre, thus  X  X  X utting down the search space X  X ) at the time of query reformulation (even if no genre was explicitly requested, the user X  X  original query might make it implicitly apparent that a particular genre is wanted) or browsing of the search results, facilitated by the gist of each retrieved web page being labeled by genre.

They also present ideas on developing a web genre palette, using the principle of  X  X  X ser warrant X  X . This at the very least would involve collecting validation from users on proposed terminology (labels and descriptions), or as was done in the education domain, ask users to identify the genres in a sampled set of web pages. People do not all have the same definitions of each particular genre, so the issue of  X  X  X nter-annotator reliability X  X  is also considered in this chapter.

Importantly, Rosso and Haas describe studies to determine the usefulness of genre for web search. This paper-based experiment, where users evaluated retrieved web pages, asked whether could users better make relevance judgments upon being told the genre? Knowing the genre did not produce faster or more stable relevance judgments, but many users preferred having the genre of the web page available in the search result to help them in the evaluation process.

Crowston et al. in Chapter 4 write about the user-centred development of a taxonomy of web genres. A genre taxonomy, as opposed to a simple genre palette, enables the production of a thesaurus showing relationships between genres and other genres, and providing a controlled vocabulary to reduce spelling or terminology variations. It is easier to choose the desired genre from a taxonomy or palette than to think of that genre  X  X  X ut of thin air X  X . 3 Automatic web genre identification In Chapter 5, Santini writes that the precursor of automatic web genre identification is the design of the genre palette. This should include the identification of emerging genres, so it is an adaptive learning classification task. An automatic system should be able to pick up new genres more quickly than  X  X  X uman acknowledgement X  X . Another problem is that genres have different levels of generality. For example,  X  X  X dvertising X  X  is a broad genre with subgenres, while individual  X  X  X hematic blogs X  X  are much narrower genres. Classifiers work best if the categories have similar levels of granularity, but it is difficult to arrange this in practice for automatic web genre classification.

The chapter talks about building a genre collection, including the deliberate introduction of noise to simulate the web population. Existing standard collections are reviewed, such as Santini X  X  own 7-web genre collection, the BBC web genres, KI-O4 (whose main purpose is to collect samples of genres which help retrieval tasks), MGC (multi-labeled genre collection) and HGC (hierarchical genre collection). Three algorithms for automatic genre classification are compared: Na X   X  ve Bayes in the form used by the PROSPECTOR expert system, an inferential rule based model using heuristics like  X  X  X f the web page is long, it is more likely to be a good blog candidate X  X  and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Na X   X  ve Bayes outperformed the other two.  X  X  X ross-testing X  X  is a major element of this chapter, but a definition and more explanation of this is needed. It seems that the differences in accuracy between the classifiers were found by a form of the Chi-squared test on the confusion matrix for each classifier and corresponding human judgments, but it would have been good to see exactly how this specific usage of the test was done, rather than just being given the general formulas for Chi-squared and two other measures which were used for cross testing, Dice and Jaccard.

All computer classifiers require that the patterns they classify are represented by a set of features, ideally those features which best describe them. For example, segments of images are often represented by colour, shape and texture, and search engines represent web pages by a set of index terms. In Chapter 6, Kim and Ross discuss the selection of representative features for web pages, so that they can most easily be classified by genre. They found that a combined representation of text content and page layout, outperform the  X  X  X ag of words X  X  model, where web pages are simply represented by the words within them, in no particular order. Since genre is  X  X  X ntertwined with topic X  X , they describe  X  X  X  general classification model than encompasses both tasks X  X . As an example of this,.  X  X  X lgebraic variety X  X  is both a topic term (mathematics) and a genre-indicating term (more often found in academic articles than others). They also use the HDR (Harmonic Descriptor Representation) of documents which takes into account the dispersion of words X  X re they clumped together, or do they appear almost periodically, evenly spaced throughout the text? Stein et al. also give a good summary of existing genre palettes and feature types to represent them in an automatic classifier in Chapter 8.

In Chapter 7, Sharoff gives advice on the use of Weka classifiers. These are general purpose automatic classifiers made available free of charge by the University of Waikato. To uncover the genre composition of the web, classifiers were trained on both the British National Corpus (BNC) or the Russian National Corpus (RNC), then these trained classifiers were used to classify a sample of the web. He found that  X  X  X iscussion X  X  was the biggest category, including academic and newspaper articles, discussion forums and archived mailing lists.  X  X  X nformation X  X , such as catalogues and dictionaries which are not well represented in traditional corpora was also an important category on the web. About a quarter of web pages were  X  X  X nstructional texts X  X  such as recipes, steps for assembly, and tutorials, and about one-sixth were  X  X  X ropaganda X  X , including those promoting goods and services. Thus Sharoff suggests that spam may not be  X  X  X he main polluter of web-derived data X  X .

Stein et al. discuss how genre can enable web search. Three main strategies are considered: positive and negative filters (i.e. require or exclude documents in certain genres from the  X  X  X it X  X  list of retrieved pages), flags returned with snippets (label the two or three line gist of each web page returned by the search with its genre), and group the returned hits by genre. Their own prototype WEGA system uses the snippet labeling approach, providing a contrasting view to the following chapter, in which Bravlavski questions the need for genre labels to be provided with search results, since users can often recognize the genre anyway just from the snippets. A better solution is  X  X  X arrying relevance and genre rankings X  X . Here a score reflecting the relevance of a web page with respect to the topic of a query, as is routinely calculated by a search engine, would be combined with a second factor reflecting the similarity of its genre to the genre specified by the user. Apparently existing  X  X  X ertical X  X  search services such as scientific search, blog search, news search engines, product search and comparison services do not use  X  X  X verly sophisticated methods X  X  to combine topic and genre, but Bravlavski demonstrates experimentally that the addition of genre-related scores can improve search engine rankings. However, he does not give his precise merging algorithm. As a proxy for genre, he uses a  X  X  X ormality X  X  score, based on the idea that more formal texts are more  X  X  X nformative X  X ). More formal texts have such features as longer average word counts and genitive chain counts, and fewer  X  X  X mileys X  X  (emoticons) and finite verbs. 4 Structure oriented models of web genres Lindemann and Littig take advantage of the graph structure of the internet to discover genre-specific features related to the patterns of linkage between web pages. Such features can enhance the classification algorithms for large data sets, and included the  X  X  X verage internal outdegree X  X  (average number of links to pages within the same web site) and  X  X  X verage external leaf outdegree X  X  (average number of links emanating from leaf pages). They also used features related to the size of the web sites, such as the number of pages and average document size, the fraction of PDF files, and features based on keywords X  X or example, the keywords most indicative of  X  X  X -shop X  X  were the German words for shop, shopping cat, shipping, online shop, and account. The best features were found by a measure from information theory called information gain. Chapter 11,  X  X  X ining graph patterns X  X  covers some of the mathematical underpinning of the analysis of linkage patterns in the web, but is difficult for the non-mathematician and seems less related to genre per se. Bjo  X  rnborn uses graph-based measures similar to those of Lindemann and Littig for the discrimination between personal and institutional academic web pages, where genres are typically  X  X  X utlink prone X  X  or  X  X  X nlink prone X  X . 5 Case studies of web genres Paolillo et al. in Chapter 13 consider the domain of amateur Flash to consider how multimedia features such as embedded graphics can be used to characterise web genres. Examples of professional Flash genres are web-based advertising and official fan club sites. Amateur flash samples can be hosted on  X  X  X ewgrounds X  X , where the plethora of genres includes older video console games such as Supermario Brothers, stick figure animations of fight scenes, and clock movies, which feature avatars with clocks as faces. Paolillo et al. discuss social processes involved in the emergence of new genres, such as the advent of new technology, but are most interested in a social network analysis built from user profiles obtained from Newgrounds, where the underlying factors include power and competition. The social positions of Flash authors were used as the basis of clustering the sites they produced into genres.

Grieve et al. discuss variation among blogs, a genre which has proliferated since the advent of blog hosting services, using a multidimensional analysis (factor analysis) in the way that Biber analysed the BNC for variation due to register in his earlier research. They describe the compilation of a grammatically-tagged blog corpus with 131 linguistic tags which have proved useful for distinguishing text types, such as prepositions, attributive adjectives, nominalizations, and passives. The most important of the discovered factors (corresponding to groups of features which tend to be found or absent from the same genres) were informational (written to inform the reader on a certain topic) versus personal focus (involved, informal); addressee focus: blogs directly addressed to the reader, characterised by frequent use of  X  X  X ou X  X ; and thematic variation X  X exts which stick to one topic versus texts which focus on many topics. In Chapter 15, Bruce looks at how to find  X  X  X volving Genres in Online Domains X  X , with the aim of producing learning materials for the teaching of English for Special Purposes (ESP). He makes use of  X  X  X enor X  X : the status and roles of readers and writers.  X  X  X ode X  X  (such as written, spoken, or a combination of these), and  X  X  X ontext X  X  (field of discourse). 6 Prospects This conclusion by the editors describes the need for the construction of large, shared benchmarks, in the form of web-genre reference corpora, so that empirical approaches to such tasks as genre classification can be compared on a level playing field. This would include developing sets of mappings from texts to various classification schemes for different purposes. Other benchmarks are needed for corpus composition and representativeness. Finally, more attention needs to be given to multilinguality X  X re the same genres found in all languages?
Overall I strongly recommend this book. It will appeal to linguists looking at new types of language emerging on the web, corpus linguists who wish to build genre-based corpora, and to information retrieval specialists who wish to go further than the current limits of web search. It is destined to become a classic research text, especially if genre-aware search engines  X  X  X ake off X  X .
