In this paper, we present a sentiment density-based fuzzy sets classifier for Chinese subjectivity classification. In this study, we first employ the odds ratio technique to extract subjective cues from training data. Then, we calculate sentiment density using the extracted subjective cues to represent sentence subjectivity. Finally, we implement a triangular fuzzy sets classifier with sentiment density as features for subjectivity classification. We conduct two experiments on the NTCIR-6 Chinese opinion data, showing the feasibility of the proposed method.
