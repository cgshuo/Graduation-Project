Each chapter is presented with a wide range of case study and real world examples of information systems including Virtual Private Networks, Intranets and Extranets. The best part of the case study feature is that it covers different cultures and countries thus furnishing a broader perspective of information systems. The major weakness of the book is that it is not a technical source to learn new concepts. Technical terms are not explained well in the book. The terms often contain ambiguity.
 it is a good book to read as each chapter covers the wide range of topics. The authors could have made the book more interesting by reducing the number of pages used to describe each topic and would have concen-trated more on the case studies. The book should serve as a ready source for managers using information systems and not for computer programmers who might actually be confused with the contents of the book. The authors should not use a lot of words to explain basic facts known by 90% of readers from the real world. The ambiguity between the technical definitions should be avoided because it could confuse readers.
This book is NOT for technical individuals. However, it is an ideal source for non-technical manager who is managing a technical team. As the key elements of networking are clearly defined it could be a good refer-ence for a business oriented manager who wants to make the best use of technology in his business. The cases at the end of each chapter illustrate the concepts mentioned in the chapter.
