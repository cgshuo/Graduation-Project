 Wikipedia is an online free and open access encyclopedia available in many languages. Wikipedia articles across over 280 languages are written by millions of editors. However, the growth of articles and their content is slowing, especially within the largest Wikipedia language: English. The sta-bilization of articles presents opportunities for multilingual Wikipedia editors to apply their translation skills to add ar-ticles and content to smaller Wikipedia languages. In this poster, we propose similarity and activity measures of Wiki-pedia articles across two languages: English and German. These measures allow us to evaluate the distribution of ar-ticles based on their knowledge coverage and their activity across languages. We show the state of Wikipedia articles as of June 2012 and discuss how these measures allow us to develop recommendation and verification models for multi-lingual editors to enrich articles and content in Wikipedia languages with relatively smaller knowledge coverage.

Wikipedia is the largest online free encyclopedia written by millions of volunteers and accessed by hundreds of mil-lions of people each month. Since its introduction in 2001, its growth in article and content has been exponential. How-ever, since 2007 growth has slowed significantly across all
S entence similarity is a related research area that looks at identifying highly similar sentences between two documents in different languages. For Wikipedia, similar sentences can be found by machine translation and the cross language link structure in articles [1]. These similar sentences can im-prove statistical machine translators by providing parallel sentences [10], and identify gaps of knowledge for Wikipedia editors [7].

These gaps of knowledge are also apparent in structural parts of Wikipedia such as templates and information boxes. For example, information boxes from different languages can be aligned, where missing facts from one language can be filled with information from other languages [2].
The semantic convergence of articles across languages can be determined by evaluating the similarity of sequential revi-sions of Wikipedia articles. When the similarity of content between revisions falls below a threshold, continuing edits do not change the meaning of articles [12].

Across many Wikipedia languages, similarities and differ-ences in articles is much greater than previously assumed, as shown by Omnipedia [4]. Omnipedia shows information that is unique to each language, and other information shared across languages. A user study of Omnipedia shows how people interact with multilingual information and highlights the vast knowledge gaps in articles across many languages.
We use the Wikipedia (complete edit history) data dump of 1 June 2012 for the English (en) Wikipedia, and 3 June we extract articles in Wikipedia X  X  namespace 0, which con-tains only encyclopedic articles. We further remove articles that do not conform to Wikipedia markup and do not have much encyclopedic content, such as article stubs and disam-biguation articles. We remove all Wikipedia markup from the article content for translation.
 Table 1 shows some statistics of the resulting data set. A revision captures information about a change made to a Wikipedia article, such as editor, time, and content. Com-mon articles are articles in both languages that have return-ing interlingual links. There are a small proportion of arti-cles with no returning link from the other language. The common registered editors found in both Wikipedias are 1.78% of the English editors, and 14.16% of the German editors. The count of the usernames is of registered editors who have made an edit on Wikipedia that is recorded in the data dump.
The Moses translator [8] is an offline free and open source statistical machine translator. We build a baseline Moses http://dumps.wikimedia.org/ and German are not sentence aligned. Finding these aligned s entences is research beyond the scope of this poster.
For each article, we have where l is the pivot language such as English, i is the article identifier, X l,i is the TF-IDF vector of the English article, and Y l,i is the TF-IDF vector of the German article trans-lated to English. The values of sim l,i are between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates high similarity.
We measure the activity of a Wikipedia article by analyz-ing the frequency and size of revisions. For each revision, we extract the time of the modification and the size of content of the article. We look at revisions of Wikipedia articles over their entire lifetime and in the most recent year covered by the data (2012) to compare past and recent activity. Due to space limitations, we present only one activity measure.
We measure activity by looking at the convergence of ar-ticle revisions to a stable state. This assumes each article has a knowledge saturation point, where additional revisions do not change the meaning of the article. We model the growth of articles as logarithmic, because articles often have high frequency of changes and increasing article size early in their existence, but gradually decreasing in frequency of changes and smaller increases in article size. We use the ab-solute time in seconds since epoch and absolute size of the article content in bytes for each revision.

To determine growth, we take the log of the seconds and bytes, and perform a simple linear regression. We use the gradient as our measure of activity, where a small gradient indicates low activity. For each article in each language, we have where t i,j is the time of revision j in seconds and s i,j is the size of revision j in bytes, and n is the total number of revisions for article i . The values of act i are between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates high activity.
The measures presented provide a summary of knowledge coverage across languages and the relative activity of those articles within one language. We discuss the results of the measures individually, and only present plots of these two measures against each other.

For the Cosine TF-IDF similarity measure, our results show over 90% of articles have less than 0.75 similarity both when using either English or German as pivot languages. The Jaccard measure shows a much lower similarity for 90% of articles, at approximately 0.25 for English, and 0.2 for German. The Dice and Cosine measures show almost iden-tical distribution of articles, where 90% of articles have a similarity less than 0.44 for English and 0.38 for German.
The Cosine TF-IDF results suggest most articles writ-ten in English and German share many common important words in both languages in describing the same topic. How-ever, when we do not adjust for the importance of words in articles using TF-IDF, the similarity drops significantly . The higher similarity observed for the English pivot lan-guage suggests German articles may be using their English article equivalents as a source of knowledge. The limitation of measuring similarity with translated text is the quality of the machine translator and the training data set.
For the Gradient activity measure from Equation 2 cal-culated over all revisions, our results show 90% of articles have an activity level over 0.8 for English, and over 0.5 for German. For the recent 2012 revisions, over 37% of articles for English and over 55% for German have an activity of 0.0; and less than 32% of active (non-zero activity) articles have an activity level over 0.8 for English and less than 24% for German.

These results suggest that over the lifetime of most arti-cles, activity is seen in some form. For recent activity, we see more than half of the German version of articles has no activity. Of the articles with non-zero activity level, we ob-serve higher activity levels in the English version compared to the German version. This may be explained by the higher number of editors working in English.

Plotting these two measures against each other shows the distribution of activity on articles across articles with dif-ferent levels of knowledge coverage. We compare recent and all revisions, and different pivot languages in Figures 1 to 4. The figures show a heatmap of the number of articles based on their similarity and activity values. For the activity mea-sure over all revisions, we see the English version of the ar-ticles generally have higher levels of activity. For the recent 2012 revisions, we see the English articles have much less activity than the German articles. The similarity shows a general grouping towards lower similarity when viewed in both English and German pivot languages.

These results show the distribution of articles based on the proposed measures. We observe some forms of clusters, which we will further explore in future work. In particular, there is a clear distinction of articles with high and low ac-tivity in the recent 2012 revisions. The four corners of each figure present options for recommendation to editors based on language skill. For example, low activity and high sim-ilarity articles (lower right corner) suggest filling in knowl-edge gaps, which may be suitable for editors learning a new language. The high similarity articles allow knowledge ver-ification models to be developed from the content as these articles show much shared knowledge. These verification models can be used to improve trust of content from read-ers, and low similarity multilingual articles can be written to be consistent across languages.
We have presented similarity and activity measures for summarizing the knowledge coverage of articles over differ-ent languages, and the level of activity on each article, re-spectively. We apply these measures to Wikipedia articles written in both English and German. We translate articles of both languages into the other to compare differences in the similarity measure when viewed using English or Ger-man as the pivot language. Our results show high knowledge coverage when we consider words important to the article. Our activity measure summarizes the level of activity of ar-ticles in each language. Our results show English versions of articles have a generally higher activity level for both recent and all revisions. Our plots of activity against similarity
