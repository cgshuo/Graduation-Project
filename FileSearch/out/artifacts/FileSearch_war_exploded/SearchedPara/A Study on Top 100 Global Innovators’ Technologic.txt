 Innovation is believed as the fundamental driver o f economic well -being, competitive advantage and success. As for companies, continual effort in technological innovation is essential to actively accommodating to the changing situation. Many factors affect a company X  X  innovation performance, among which, the combination of knowledge is a known determinant [1] . Knowledge combination means that two or more previously unrelated prices of knowledge combine together to form a qualitatively new piece of knowledge. I nnovation is considered to be accomplished by t his process [ 2 ] . Although knowledge combination is of keen important to a company X  X  innovation performance, there lack for empirical work on companies  X  knowledge combination. So, in this study, we want to analyze the technological innovation of companies from the knowledge combination view. 
From the knowledge -based perspective, there are two key points in a company X  X  technological innovation, integrati ng existing knowledge and expanding knowledge base since broader knowledge base can provide more opportunities for making inno-vation [ 3 ] . A company has specific technological portfolios. The process of its tech-nological innovation concludes two main parts, seeking for new combination of exist-ing technologies and expanding new technical fields to facilitate the diversification of exploration on how companies develop new tec hnologies and how do these new tech-nologies combine with e xisting technologies in making innovation. 
In the previous researches, measuring a company X  X  technological capabilities has been a focus for scholars. Inuzuka used the frequency of the patent IPC c ode pairs to estimate the newness of a combination of knowledge [ 3 ] ; Nakamura proposed a knowledge combination modeling to measure knowledge similarity between different technological domains using patent data [ 4 ] . We also use patent to evaluate compa-nies X  technological evolution.

Patents, as the most effective carrier of technological information, enable a detailed understanding of how and to what extent each technology was used in the process of companies X  technological innovation. The primary system for organizing patents is classifications. A patent classification refers to the manner by which examiners at a patent office arrange patent documents according to the technological features of inventions. Dibiaggio and Nesta argued that technology classes cou ld be the most appropriate unit of analysis for exploiting the information contained in the patent databases [ 5 ] . 
Patent co -classifications already have been mentioned in the OECD Manual of 1994 as a potential indicator of linkages among technologies [ 6 ] . Over the past dec-ade, patent co -classification analysis has been widely used to investigate the similarity and relatedness among technologies [ 7 ] , identify core technologies of a company [ 8 ] or an industry [ 9 ] , evaluate the technology convergence [ 10 ] . Th e evolution of p atent co -classification network just provides a surrogate of the ways in which its technolo-gies develop through times. 
In this study, we want to investigate if the technical expansion of successful inno-vators has some features in common. I n other word, how do their new technologies relate to technologies they already owned? Clarivate Analytics, formerly the Intellec-tual Property &amp; Science business of Thomson Reuters has been doing the  X  X op 100 Global Innovators X  program for six years. Clari vate X  X  report showed that the top 100 innovators spent more than $227 billion on R&amp;D and generated more the $4 trillion in revenue in 2015 [ 11 ] . Th ese companies not only show good example of innovation activity that drive s economic well -being and competiti ve advantages but also set good examples for other hi -tech companies in efficient technology innovation. We will analyze these companies X  patent co -classification networks from the aspect of how new technology nodes impact and rebuild the existing network topology when they entering the network.

It should be mentioned that this paper is just a research framework. We analyzed the Google company, outstanding representative of the top 100 innovators, and found some features of its technological evolution. Othe r top innovators should be studied in the further study to testify if successful companies share the common feature. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains that we will ana-lyze the network new nodes from two parts according to whether it connect to exist-ing nodes. Section 3 introduces the data source and research methods. Finally, s ection 4 provides the conclusion and introduces future work. In the last section, we have stated that we will analyze how new nodes of companies X  patent co -classification networks is connected to the old ones when entering the net-work to investigate the way companies developing new technologies. Figure 1 shows an ex ample of co -classification network evolution . In the picture, one node stands for one classification code , the lines between two nodes means the related two classifica-tion codes has at least once appeared in one patent. In this study, we will use Derwent M anual Codes to build the co -classification network. Derwent Manual Code s are assigned to patents by Derwent's indexers. They are used to indicate the novel tech-nical aspects of an invention, and also its applications. Compared to other patent clas-sificatio n system like the most used IPC classification code, Derwent Manual Codes is clearer and detailed thus suitable for patent analysis. 
As we can see in the figure , d uring the evolution of network, it tend s to expand by the addition of new nodes or new links between the nodes [ 12 ] . This process just ac-cords with the two parts of companies X  technological innovation, seeking for new technology combination and expanding new technical fields as we mentioned above. To see the new technologies involved, some new no des appear without connecting to the existing nodes in network. And other nodes are connecting with nodes existing the year before. We will respectively analyze these two kinds of new nodes .
 2.1 Isolated new nodes Technology innovation takes place through symbiosis [ 13 ] , tinkering [ 14 ] or new design [ 15 ] that new functional structures and artifacts are obtained. New inventions often result from the combination of predefined designs or building blocks. However, a completely new solution can also emerge. Presented in the patent co -classification networks, some new no des enter the network without connecting to existing nodes. 
F or companies, constantly developing new technologies to expand the technology structure is essential to keep the technological advantage since a broader knowledge base may provide more opportuni ties for recombining the existing elements of knowledge into new syntheses [ 3 ] . On one hand, companies need to quickly expand the technology sector to maintain the technological advantage. On the other hand, for the limitation of research and development f und, companies should rationally allocate the fund and make a balance between developing existing core technologies and new technologies. S o, here we propose the hypothesis,
Hypothesis 1: the rate of isolated new entities which can be viewed as innovations of a completely new design count for a small proportion of network new entities, and it will not fluctuate widely. In other word , a small portion of new technologies com-panies develop will have no knowledge combination with existing knowledge at first. 2.2 Ne w entities connecting with old ones It has been suggested that innovations occur mainly by combination: the more inven-tions accumulate, the higher the probability that new inventions are obtained from previous designs [ 1 6 ] . So, when a company developing ne w technologies, most of them work with technologies company already owned. Performed in the co -classification networks, most new nodes entering the network will connect to existing nodes. However, how do new nodes connecting to the old ones while entering the network? The scaling behavior of different kinds of network has been studied by many scholars. And , what  X  s the feature of scaling behavior of patent co -classification networks ? Attachment mechanism. Many real -world networks like the internet and social rela-tions have a scale -free structure [ 1 7 ] . P referential attachment indicates that new nodes attach preferentially to existing nodes that are already well connected. That is, a new node is connected to some existing nodes in the network based on its numbe r of links measured by degree centrality.

Oppositely, there exist s another kind of attachment mechanism, in which new nodes prefer to attach to existing nodes with lower degree [ 1 8 ] . Such a mechanism could play a role in some transportation networks, such as food webs. The links in such networks transport some sort of resource to feed the nodes.
 Attachment mechanism of nodes of p atent co -classification network . In the patent classification co -occurrence network, each node stands for one technology, and line s between nodes means that two technolog ies at least appear once in one patent. A pa-tent with multiple technology classifications can be regarded as knowledge blended invention that belongs to heterogeneous technology domains [ 10 ] . 
There is no directly re lated literature analyzing the scaling behavior of patent co -classification networks. However, many researchers analyzed the degree of co -classification network nodes to identify core technolog ies of a company or an industry which means some nodes are connecting to many other nodes while some only have relationship with a few nodes. 
It is believed that the preferential attachment process generates a long -tailed distri-butio n following a Pareto distribution or power law in its tail [ 19 ] . Thus, we drew the degree distribution of Derwent Manual Code co -classification networks of Google Company to investigate the attachment mechanism of companies X  technology net-work. As we can s ee figure 2, the degree distribution closely follows a power law distribution which means nodes with higher number of connections count for a small proportion while most classification nodes are connected to few nodes. So, we can assume that a large propor tion new technology node enters in a company X  X  co -classification networks with existing nodes with higher degree.

And this process can be explained by the different degree of attention companies pay to their technologies. Every company owns its core technologies to distinguish from other competitors. Core technology is not only an important part of core compe-tency but also the key of changing the core competency into competition advantages [ 20 ] . And in order to keep this technological advantages, when companies develop new technologies, most of them will serve for its core technologies or corporate with core technologi es to make innovation. So, here we pro posed another hypothesis,
Hypothesis 2: A large proportion of new classification nodes appear in a compa-ny X  X  patent co -classification networks with existing nodes with higher degree. In other word , a large proportion o f new technologies that a company involved serve for its core technology. 3.1 S ample and d ata collection We drew our sample from companies listed in  X 2016 Top 100 Global Innovators Re-port X  made by Clarivate Analytics . They choose 100 most innovative companies around the world by criteria include patent volume, application -to -grant success, globalization and citation influence. 
W e choose these enterprises for the following reasons: ( 1 ) Patent volume . Accord-ing to Clariv ate Analytics  X  criteria above mentioned, these enterprises at least pass the volume stage. Since we use patent data to form co -classification networks and analyze the network evolution, patent volume is basic to avoid the impact of network size; (2) Patent quality. The increasing awareness of intellectual property rights causes too many low -quality patents applications [ 21 ] . T he other three criteria ensure the quality situation of companies.
 After excluding companies with incomplete data, w e retrieved patent data from the Derwent World Patents Index (DWPI) using DWPI patentee code. The Derwent W orld Patents Index (DWPI) is a database containing patent applications and grants from 44 of the world's patent issuing authorities. Each record within the database defines a patent family, the grouping of patent documentation recorded at the various from this database is more suitable to analyze patent holders since each patent in this database represents for one invention without repetition.

DWPI patentee code is a uniqu e 4 -letter code Derwent assign ed to companies worldwide, to search patent data of these companies . It should be mentioned that, these standard codes encompass known subsidiaries as well as the parent company, so provide a valuable search tool for obtaining a complete set of DWPI records relating to an organization as a whole. 3.2 R ate of isolated new nodes B ecause patent application and technological innovation have a periodicity, we will analyze the network new nodes year by year . Table 1 shows the primary dat a down-loaded. Here  X  stands for the application year of the patent. And  X  stands for the Der-went manual code. The data include information of the patent application time and the manual code it belongs. 
Firstly, new DWPI classification codes involved in the network every year will be identified. The number of new nodes will be recorded as  X  X  X  . Then we will divide these new nodes into two parts according to their co -occurrence objects in the patent. If a new node X  X  co -occurrence objects haven X  X  appeared in the company X  X  patent be-fore, this node will be regarded as the isolated new entities. And the number of these simply calculated according to the following equation 1, 3.3 Attachment mechanism of nodes relating to existing ones Apart from the index of isolated new entities rate, how other nodes were connected to the existing nodes are studies. We analyze the attachment mechanism by investigating the relationship between node s degree and its probability of being connected. 
Firstly, the probability of being connected  X  (  X  ) was calculated. The connecting probability was calculated according to the following equation 2: where  X  (  X  &gt;0) is the degree of a node in the network.  X  (  X  ) stands for the quantity of nodes with degree  X  .  X  (  X  ) means the frequen cy of being connected of nodes with degree k. In the study of networks, the degree of a node in a network is the number of connections it has to other nodes. In the technology co -classification network, degree distribution  X  (  X  ) is equivalent to the so -call ed distribution of co -occurrence times of classification codes. 
Then we analyzed the relationship between two variable  X  and  X  (  X  ) using power law distribution test . The index  X  2 was recorded. 3.4 Hypothesis testing Hypothesis 1. We need to test the index, rate of isolated new entities of top innova-tors , to see if it fluctuates within a narrow range. A set of panel data  X   X  X  X  was formed by calculating the index, rate of isolated new nodes, of company  X  from the first year this company have patent applicati ons to the year 2016.  X   X  X  X  means the rate of isolated new nodes of company  X  in year  X  . 
Two points should be mentioned here, (1) Firstly, we discard the first four years X  data to avoid the impact of small network size. (2) Because the 100 innovators b egan needs to be unified. We use the shortest time series as the benchmark; the other com-pany's data were shortened to this benchmark through moving average method.

We us e the standard deviation to evaluate the stability of index  X   X  X  X  of every com-pany following time series . And test if most of the top 100 innovators behaviors coin-cide with the hypothesis . The evaluation index  X  X  X  is calculated through the following equa tion , where  X  means the length of time series, and  X  means the number of compa-nies being studied. Hypothesis 2. The same method was used to form the panel data set  X   X  X  X  2 , which means in the year  X  , the preferential attachment condition of network new nodes of company  X  . As we assumed, new entities prefer to connecting old nodes with higher degree. So, the index  X   X  X  X  2 should be a stable high number. T he same method as mentioned in hypothesis 1 was used to unify the time series and standard deviation to evaluate the stability of index  X   X  X  X  2 . In this study, we use patent co -classification method to for m the technology networks of these innovative companies and analyze the ways new nodes entering into the net-work. Network new nodes can be classified into two kinds. One is isolated from exist-ing once. And we proposed a hypothesis that the rate of isolated new nodes which can be viewed as innovations of a completely new design count for a small proportion of network new entities, and it will not fluctuate widely. To change a word, a small por-tion of new technologies companies develop will have no knowledge combination with existing knowledges at first. The other kind of nodes enter the network with connection to old technological nodes. And we proposed another hypothesis tha t a large proportion of new classification nodes appear in a company X  X  patent co -clas sification networks with existing nodes with higher degree. To change a word, a large proportion of new technologies that a company involved serve for its core tech-nology.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the process of technological innovation of companies that focus on innovation and have achieve outstanding innovation re-sults from the aspect of how they involve new technologies in the process of innova-tion. For these companies, developing technologies they hold, expanding their techno-logical n etwork, is essential to keep technical advantage and thus maintain their ad-vantage in the competition. However, for the limitation of R&amp;D input, companies should make a balance between existing core technologies and new technologies. It is ways successful innovative companies developing new technologies. Experiences and suggestions can be made for other High -tech enterprise. 
This paper is just a research framework, the n ext step of our work is to conduct empirical analysis to analyze the world top innovators X  technology innovation. Acknowledgement .
