Tree-Local Multi-Component Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TL-MCTAG) is an appealing formalism for natural language representation because it arguably allows the encapsu-lation of the appropriate domain of locality within its elementary structures (Kallmeyer and Romero 2007). Its flexible multicomponent structure allows modeling of lexical items that may ultimately have elements far apart in a sentence, such as quantifiers and wh -words. Its limited expressivity provides constraints on movement and, we posit, may have generated additional popularity based on a misconception about its parsing complexity.
 structures, such as the syntax and the semantics of a single word or construction or the syntax of a single word or construction and its translation into another language, with a pair of elementary trees. This flexibility permits conceptually simple, highly expressive, and tightly coupled modeling of the relationship between the syntax and semantics of a language or the syntax and semantics of two languages. As a result, it has frequently been put to use in a growing body of research into incorporating semantics into the Tree-
Adjoining Grammar (TAG) framework (Kallmeyer and Joshi 2003; Han 2006; Nesson and Shieber 2006, 2007). It is also under investigation as a possible base formalism for use in synchronous-grammar based machine translations systems (Nesson 2009).
Similar pairing of elementary structures of the TAG formalism is too constrained to capture the inherent divergence in structure between different languages or even be-tween the syntax and semantics of a language. Pairing of more expressive formalisms is too flexible to provide appropriate constraints and has unacceptable consequences for processing efficiency.
 to be equivalent in expressivity to TAG, the complexity of TL-MCTAG is still not well understood. Perhaps because of its equivalence to TAG, questions of processing efficiency have not been adequately addressed. This article offers a thorough exami-nation of the problem of TL-MCTAG recognition, showing that even highly restricted forms of TL-MCTAG are NP-complete to recognize. However, in spite of the provable difficulty of the recognition problem, we offer several algorithms that can substantially improve processing efficiency. First, we present a parsing algorithm that improves on the baseline parsing method and runs in polynomial time when both the fan-out (the maximum number of trees in a tree set) and rank (the maximum number of trees that may be substituted or adjoined into a given tree) of the input grammar are bounded. Second, we offer an optimal, efficient algorithm for factorizing a grammar to produce a strongly equivalent TL-MCTAG grammar with the rank of the grammar minimized. 1.1 Summary of Results
TAG is a mildly context-sensitive grammar formalism widely used in natural language processing. Multicomponent TAG (MCTAG) refers to a group of formalisms that 444 generalize TAG by allowing elementary structures to be sets of TAG trees. One member of the MCTAG formalism group is Tree-Local MCTAG (TL-MCTAG), in which all trees from a single elementary tree set are constrained to adjoin or substitute into a single tree in another elementary tree set. Weir (1988) shows that this constraint is sufficient to guarantee that TL-MCTAG has weak generative capacity equivalent to the polynomially parsable TAG.
 that the universal recognition problem for TL-MCTAG is NP-hard. This result calls into question the practicality of systems that employ TL-MCTAG as the formalism for expressing a natural language grammar. In this article we present a more fine-grained analysis of the processing complexity of TL-MCTAG. We demonstrate (Section 3) that even under restricted definitions where either the rank or the fan-out of the grammar is bounded, the universal recognition problem is NP-complete.
 elementary structures as vectors of trees rather than as unordered sets (Section 4). We demonstrate that this variant of the definition of the formalism (the vector definition )is consistent with the linguistic applications of the formalism presented in the literature.
Universal recognition of the vector definition of TL-MCTAG is NP-complete when both the rank and fan-out are unbounded. However, when the rank is bounded, the universal recognition problem is polynomial in both the length of the input string and the grammar size.
 dates both the set and vector definitions of TL-MCTAG. Although no algorithms for parsing TL-MCTAG have previously been published, the standard method for parsing linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) X  X quivalent formalisms can be applied directly to TL-MCTAG to produce a quite inefficient baseline algorithm in which the polynomial degree of the length of the input string depends on the input grammar.
We offer an alternative parser for TL-MCTAG in which the polynomial degree of the length of the input string is constant, though the polynomial degree of the grammar size depends on the input grammar. This alternative parsing algorithm is more appealing than the baseline algorithm because it performs universal recognition of TL-MCTAG (vector definition) with constant polynomial degree in both the length of the input string and the grammar size when rank is bounded.
 to be used for linguistic applications. However, it is possible given a TL-MCTAG to minimize the rank of the grammar. In the penultimate section of the paper (Section 6) we offer a novel and efficient algorithm for transforming an arbitrary TL-MCTAG into a strongly equivalent TL-MCTAG where the rank is minimized. 1.2 Related Work Our work on TL-MCTAG complexity bears comparison to that of several others.
Kallmeyer (2009) provides a clear and insightful breakdown of the different charac-teristics of MCTAG variants and the effect of these characteristics on expressivity and complexity. That work clarifies the definitions of MCTAG variants and the relationship between them rather than presenting new complexity results. However, it suggests the possibility of proving results such as ours in its assertion that, after a standard
TAG parse, a check of whether particular trees belong to the same tree set cannot be performed in polynomial time. Kallmeyer also addresses the problem of parsing
MCTAG, although not specifically for TL-MCTAG. The method proposed differs from ours in that MCTAGs are parsed first as a standard TAG, with any conditions on tree or set locality checked on the derivation forest as a second step. No specific algorithm is presented for performing the check of tree-locality on a TAG derivation forest, so it is difficult to directly compare the methods. However, that method cannot take advantage of the gains in efficiency produced by discarding inappropriate partial parses at the time that they are first considered. Aside from Kallmeyer X  X  work, little attention has been paid to the problem of directly parsing TL-MCTAG.
 of the recognition problem for some linguistically motivated extensions of TAG that are similar to TL-MCTAG. Their work shows the NP-hardness of the recognition problem for these variants and, as an indirect result, also demonstrates the NP-hardness of TL-MCTAG recognition. This work differs from ours in that it does not directly show the
NP-hardness of TL-MCTAG recognition and does not further locate and constrain the source of the NP-hardness of the problem to the rank of the input grammar, nor does it provide mitigation through rank reduction of the grammar or by other means. to the body of work on induction of TAGs from a treebank exemplified by Chen and
Shanker (2004). The factorization performed in their work is done on the basis of syn-tactic constraints rather than with the goal of reducing complexity. Working from a treebank of actual natural language sentences, their work does not have the benefit of explicitly labeled adjunction sites but rather must attempt to reconstruct a derivation from complete derived trees.
 synchronous context-free grammars (CFGs) (Gildea, Satta, and Zhang 2006; Zhang and Gildea 2007) and on factorizing synchronous TAGs (Nesson, Satta, and Shieber 2008).
Synchronous grammars are a special case of multicomponent grammars, so the prob-lems are quite similar to the TL-MCTAG factorization problem. However, synchronous grammars are fundamentally set-local rather than tree-local formalisms, which in some cases simplifies their analysis. In the case of CFGs, the problem reduces to one of identifying problematic permutations of non-terminals (Zhang and Gildea 2007) and can be done efficiently by using a sorting algorithm to binarize any non-problematic per-mutations until only the intractable correspondences remain (Gildea, Satta, and Zhang 2006). This method is unavailable in the TAG case because the elementary structures may have depth greater than one and therefore the concept of adjacency relied upon in their work is inapplicable. The factorization algorithm of Nesson, Satta, and Shieber (2008) is the most closely related to this one but is not directly applicable to TL-MCTAG because each link is presumed to have exactly two locations and all adjunctions occur in a set-local rather than tree-local manner. 2. Technical Background
A tree-adjoining grammar consists of a set of elementary tree structures of arbitrary depth, which are combined by the operations of adjunction and substitution . Auxiliary trees are elementary trees in which the root and a frontier node, called the foot node and distinguished by the diacritic  X  , are labeled with the same nonterminal A .The adjunction operation entails splicing in an auxiliary tree in an internal node within an elementary tree also labeled with nonterminal A . Trees without a foot node, which serve as a base case for derivations and may combine with other trees by substitution, 446 are called initial trees . Examples of the adjunction and substitution operations are given in Figure 1. For further background, we refer the reader to the survey by Joshi and Schabes (1997).
 the elementary structures are combined using the TAG operations to form the derived tree. The nodes of the derivation tree are labeled by the names of the elementary trees and the edges are labeled by the addresses at which the child trees substitute or adjoin. In contrast to CFGs, the derivation and derived trees are distinct.
 tion sites explicitly with numbered links in order to simplify the presentation of the issues raised by multi-component adjunctions. Each link may be used only once in a derivation. Adjunctions may only occur at nodes marked with a link. A numbered link at a single site in a tree specifies that a single adjunction is available at that site. An obligatory adjunction constraint indicates that at least one link at a given node must be used (Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi, 1975; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1985). We notate obligatory adjunction constraints by underlining the label of the node to which the constraint applies. Because we use explicit links, the edges in the derivation tree are labeled with the number of the link used rather than the traditional label of the address at which the operation takes place.
 occur at a single adjunction site (Vijay-Shanker 1987; Shieber and Schabes 1994). In the standard definition of TAG, multiple adjunction is disallowed to ensure that each derivation tree unambiguously specifies a single derived tree (Vijay-Shanker 1987). Be-cause each available adjunction is explicitly notated with a numbered link, our notation implicitly disallows multiple adjunction but permits a third possibility: bounded mul-tiple adjunction. Bounded multiple adjunction permits the formalism to obtain some of the potential linguistic advantages of allowing multiple adjunction while preventing unbounded multiple adjunction. The usual constraint of allowing only one adjunction at a given adjunction site may be enforced in our link notation by permitting only one link at a particular link site to be used.
 than single trees (Joshi and Schabes 1997). The basic operations are the same but all trees
To allow for multi-component adjunction, a numbered link may appear on two or more nodes in a tree, signifying that the adjoining trees must be members of the same tree set. Any tree in a set may adjoin at any link location if it meets other adjunction or substitution conditions such as a matching node label. Thus a single multicomponent link may give rise to many distinct derived trees even when the link is always used by the same multicomponent tree set. An example is given in Figure 2. This standard definition of multicomponent adjunction we will call the set definition for contrast with a variation we introduce in Section 4. A derivation tree for a multicomponent TAG is the same as for TAG except that the nodes are labeled with the names of elementary tree sets.
 tree (Weir 1988). Using the numbered link notation introduced earlier for adjunction sites, a tree-local MCTAG (TL-MCTAG) is one in which the scope of the link numbers is a single elementary tree. An example TL-MCTAG operation is given in Figure 3. In contrast, an MCTAG is set-local if the trees from a single tree set are required to adjoin within a single elementary tree set and an MCTAG is non-local if the trees from a single tree set may adjoin to trees that are not within a single tree set. In a set-local MCTAG the scope of a link is a single elementary tree set, and in a non-local MCTAG the scope of a link is the entire grammar.

TAG; a combination of well-chosen additional constraints and additions of duplicates of trees to the grammar can produce a weakly equivalent TAG. Alternatively, a feature-based TAG where the features enforce the same constraints may be used. Although the generative capacity of the formalism is not increased, any such conversion from TL-
MCTAG to TAG may require an exponential increase in the size of the grammar as we prove in Section 3. 3. Complexity
We present several complexity results for TL-MCTAG. S X gaard, Lichte, and Maier (2007) show indirectly that TL-MCTAG membership is NP-hard. For clarity, we present a direct 448 proof here. We then present several novel results demonstrating that the hardness result holds under significant restrictions of the formalism.
 of nodes appearing in all elementary trees in the tree sets of the grammar. Fan-out , f , measures the number of trees in the largest tree set in the grammar. We show that even when the fan-out is bounded to a maximum of two, the NP-hardness result still holds.
The rank , r , of a grammar is the maximum number of derivational children possible for any tree in the grammar, or in other words, the maximum number of links in any tree in the grammar. We show that when rank is bounded, the NP-hardness result also holds.
 the additional expressive power provided by the adjunction operation of TAG. Put simply, the trees in the tree sets used in our constructions meet the constraints of Tree Insertion Grammar (TIG), a known context-free X  X quivalent formalism (Schabes and
Waters 1995). As a result, we can conclude that the increase in complexity stems from the multi-component nature of the formalism rather than from the power added by an unconstrained adjunction operation. 3.1 Universal Recognition of TL-MCTAG is NP-Complete
In this section we prove that universal recognition of TL-MCTAG is NP-complete when neither the rank nor the fan-out of the grammar is bounded.
 { v 1 , ... , v p is a disjunction of three literals over the alphabet of all literals L
We represent each clause by a set of three literals. The language 3SAT is defined as the set of all conjunctive formulas over the members of C that are satisfiable. Theorem 1
The universal recognition problem for TL-MCTAG with unbounded rank and fan-out is NP-hard.
 Proof Let V , C be an arbitrary instance of the 3SAT problem. 1 grammar to guess the truth assignments for V and use the tree sets to keep track of the dependencies among different clauses in C . Two tree sets are constructed for each vari-able, one corresponding to an assignment of true to the variable and one corresponding sets to be used. The tree set for a particular truth assignment for a particular variable v makes it possible to introduce, by means of another adjunction, terminal symbols taken given assignment to v i . In this way, the string w = 1  X  X  X  all clauses are satisfied by the truth assignment to some variable they contain. set S contains the single tree: In this tree, the  X  X ows X  correspond to the variables and the  X  X olumns X  to the clauses.
Each non-terminal node within a row is labeled with the same link to ensure that a tree set representing a single variable X  X  effect on each clause will adjoin at each link. the value true to v i , contains n trees, one for each clause c of the value false to v i  X  contains n trees, one for each clause c follows: tree allows the corresponding clause number terminal symbol to be recognized by an appropriate variable instance. 2 450 truth assignment that satisfies C . A satisfying truth assignment can be read directly off then v k is true (respectively, false ). The converse can be shown by using a satisfying truth assignment for C to construct a derivation for w  X  L ( G ).
 tree sets in the grammar is 2 p + 2 n + 1, the total number of trees in the grammar is bounded by n (2 p + 2 n + 1), and the length of w is n . All trees in the grammar have constant size except for the initial tree, which has size np .
 Theorem 2
The universal recognition problem for TL-MCTAG with unbounded rank and fan-out is in NP.
 Proof
We show that given an arbitrary TL-MCTAG grammar G and any input string w ,the determination of w  X  L ( G ) can be performed in non-deterministic polynomial time. string, E , can be generated in time polynomial in | G | using the standard graph reach-ability algorithm used for context-free grammars in time polynomial in Soisalon-Soininen 1988).
 for w  X  L ( G ), there must exist a truncated derivation tree for w that has size no larger than | G | X | w | . We define a truncated derivation tree as a derivation tree in which the children of elementary tree sets in E are optionally removed.
 one or more TAG trees. We call a node n of D a non-splitting node if a single one of its children in the derivation tree, n i , generates the same lexical material from the input string as n itself. 3 We call it a splitting node if more than one of its children generates a non-empty part of the portion of the input string generated by n itself or if n itself contributes lexical material. We proceed from the root of chains of non-splitting nodes. Assume that the root of D is a non-splitting node. This input string. Its other children all generate the empty string (and therefore must also be members of E ). We truncate the derivation tree at each child of n other than n iterate the process on node n i . If during the examination of a chain of non-splitting nodes we encounter a node identical to one that we have already seen, we remove the entire cycle from the derivation tree because it is not essential to the derivation.
Because all cycles are removed, the longest possible chain of non-splitting nodes we can find before encountering a splitting node or reaching the bottom of the derivation tree is | G | .
 empty string and then iterate the process of non-splitting node identification on those children that generate lexical material. In the worst case, the process encounters w splitting nodes, each of which may be separated by a chain of non-splitting nodes of maximum length bounded by | G | . This process, therefore, produces a truncated derivation tree with size bounded by | G | X | w | .
 because the size of the subderivation tree generating the empty string may not be bounded by a polynomial in the size of the grammar. However, the content of the part of the derivation tree used to generate the empty string is not necessary for determining membership of w  X  L ( G ) because we know that each truncated node is a member of that will non-deterministically guess a truncated derivation tree of size no larger than |
G | X | w | . It then checks that the guessed derivation successfully derives w . Because the TL-MCTAG membership is in NP.
 tuple conversion method used to prove equivalency) (Weir 1988) and the fact that
LCFRS membership is PSPACE-complete that SL-MCTAG membership is also PSPACE-complete (Kaji et al. 1992, 1994). Until the results shown in Theorems 1 and 2 it was not known whether TL-MCTAG was in NP. Although the difference in generative capacity between TL-MCTAG and SL-MCTAG is well known, this proven difference in complexity (assuming NP = PSPACE) is novel.
 length of non-splitting chains does not hold for set-local MCTAG. In set-local MCTAG a tree tuple may be non-splitting while also performing a permutation of the order of the lexical output generated by its children. Permutation is possible because set-locality allows the tuple of strings generated by a tree tuple to be held separate for an arbitrary number of steps in a derivation. This directly follows the basis of the reasoning of Kaji et al. (1992) in their proof that LCFRS is PSPACE-complete. 3.2 Universal Recognition of TL-MCTAG with Bounded Fan-Out is NP-Complete
The grammar constructed in the proof of Theorem 1 has fan-out n , the number of clauses. However, the hardness result proved herein holds even if we restrict tree sets to have at most two elements (TL-MCTAG(2)). 4 The result provided here is as tight as possible. If tree sets are restricted to a maximum size of one (TL-MCTAG(1)), the formalism reduces to TAG and the hardness result does not hold.
 Theorem 3
The universal recognition problem for TL-MCTAG(2) with fan-out limited to two and unbounded rank is NP-complete.
 Proof
Let V , C be an arbitrary instance of the 3SAT problem. We define a more complex string w = w (1) w (2)  X  X  X  w ( p ) w c where w c is a representation of C and w assignment for the variable v i ,1  X  i  X  p . The proof strategy is as follows. We construct 452 a TL-MCTAG(2) grammar G such that each w ( i ) can be derived from G in exactly two ways using the left members of tree sets of size 2 that correspond to the variables (and a single initial tree set of size 1). We call the part of w comprising w string . The prefix string enforces the constraint of permitting only two derivations by requiring a strictly alternating string of terminal symbols that can only be generated by the grammar when the truth assignment is stable for a particular variable. The assignment for V . The right trees from the tree sets derive the components of w compatible with the guessed truth assignments for v 1 , ... , v how G , w is constructed given an instance of 3SAT V , C .

The functions  X  and  X  are used to produce pieces of the prefix string and will only produce the correct prefix string for a variable if the truth assignment is consistent within the derivation. The function  X  is used to produce strings representing the clauses satisfied by a particular truth assignment to a variable. For every variable v ,1  X  i  X  p , the clauses  X  ( i ,1),  X  ( i ,2), ... ,  X  ( i , clauses  X  ( i , | A i | + 1), ... ,  X  ( i , m i ) are all the clauses in  X  ( i ,1) = a i b i and let  X  ( i , h ) = a i if h is even and  X  ( i , h ) = b every 1  X  i  X  p ,let  X  ( i , h ) = a i if h is odd, and  X  ( i , h ) = b and let  X  ( i , m i ) = a i b i if m i is odd and b i a i  X  is that a string w ( i ) can be parsed either as a sequence of  X  ( i , intermixed elements. The grammar must  X  X ommit X  to parsing the string one way or the other, corresponding to committing to a value for the variable v struct: (1) a tree set of length two for each combination of a variable and clause that the (one for each truth assignment) of length two that only contribute the string indicating the truth assignment of the variable but no satisfied clause, and (3) a singleton tree set containing only an initial tree rooted in S . The initial tree has n + 1 branches with the first branch intended to yield the prefix string w (1)  X  X  X  intended to yield c k where 1  X  k  X  n . Although it is possible to generate strings not of the form of w using this construction, given a pair G , w where w respects the definition above, we show that w  X  L ( G ) if and only if C is satisfiable.

The first index, i , corresponds to variable v i . The second is an index into the series 1 clause c j . The use of multiple indices to name the links is for clarity only. They may be renamed freely. 454 derivations of two possible satisfying truth assignments for Boolean formula ( x z ) from the example, the structure of the prefix string enforces the requirement that either with a + is used to satisfy a single clause.

By the construction, if w is of the form just described, for a given variable v two derivations of w ( i ) will be possible, one in which all tree sets corresponding to that variable are T tree sets and one in which all are F tree sets. Starting from a truth assignment that satisfies C, we can prove that w  X  L ( G ) by induction on

We now show that universal recognition of TL-MCTAG is NP-complete even when the rank is bounded.

The language 3PAR is defined as the set of all tuples s 1 , ... , s 3 m , t , satisfying the following condition: The multiset Q = can be partitioned into multisets Q i ,1  X  i  X  m , such that for every 1 3PAR is NP-complete even in case the integers s i are all represented in unary notation.

We provide a reduction from 3PAR. 6 Let s 1 , ... , s 3 m problem, with all of the integers s i represented in unary notation. Our target grammar G is defined as follows. We use a set of nonterminal symbols symbol. We take the set of terminal symbols to be { a ,$ } tree sets.

The second (multi)set of G contains elementary trees  X  sponds to a context-free production of the form A  X  a s i : the second set accordingly, and by inserting these trees into the link of the elementary tree  X  .

Theorem 2. 3.4 Universal Recognition of TL-MCTAG with Fixed Input String is NP-Complete We now show the unusual complexity result that universal recognition of TL-MCTAG is
NP-complete even when the input string is fixed. Although it is uncommon to require this result, we rely on it in Section 5 to demonstrate that our parser has better time complexity than the baseline parsing method for TL-MCTAG that we generalize from the standard parsing method for LCFRS-equivalent formalisms.
 variable occurs in at most four clauses with no repeats in a clause. This problem was shown to be NP-complete by Tovey (1984).
 Theorem 5 Universal recognition of TL-MCTAG is NP-complete when the input string is fixed. Proof
Let V , C be an arbitrary instance of the 3SAT problem where each variable occurs in no more than four clauses and does not repeat within a single clause. As in the proof of Theorem 1, we use the derivations of the grammar to guess the truth assignments for V and use the tree sets to keep track of the dependencies among different clauses in C .
Two tree sets are constructed for each variable, one corresponding to a true assignment and one corresponding to a false assignment. The prohibition on multiple adjunction ensures that only one of these two tree sets can be used for each variable. The tree set of a particular truth assignment for a particular variable v obligatory adjunction constraints for the nonterminal symbols representing each of the provide overflow space in the event that more than one variable satisfies a particular clause. We fix the input string w to be the empty string. None of the trees of the grammar contain any terminal symbols. However, a successful parse of the empty string can only be achieved if all of the obligatory adjunction constraints are satisfied and this occurs if and only if all clauses of the formula are satisfied by the truth assignment to some variable.

The initial tree set S contains the single tree: ing an assignment of the value true (respectively, false )to v at most five trees, one for the variable itself and one for each clause c that when v i is true (respectively false) c j is satisfied. More formally, tree set T trees V i  X  and C j  X  if and only if v i  X  c j ,for1  X  j  X  if and only if v i  X  c j ,for1  X  j  X  n .

Theorem 2. 458 4. An Alternative Definition of TL-MCTAG: Tree Vectors
The proof of NP-hardness of TL-MCTAG in the bounded rank case given in Theorem 4 depends crucially on the treatment of the elementary structures of the TL-MCTAG as unordered sets. In order to produce the satisfying partitions for the 3PAR problem, any tree from the second tree set must be able to adjoin at any location of link tree set. This is in accordance with the usual definition of multi-component TAG. An alternative definition of multi-component TAG in which the elementary structures are treated as vectors is suggested by the explicit use of numbered links at the available adjunction sites. Under this definition, each location of a link is also given an index and only the tree at that index in a given vector may adjoin at that link location. An example contrasting the two definitions is given in Figure 6.
 does not in itself show that vector-definition TL-MCTAG is polynomial in the bounded rank case. We show this constructively in Section 5 by presenting a parser for vector definition TL-MCTAG for which the polynomial degree of both the length of the in-put string and the grammar size is constant when the rank of the input grammar is bounded.
 makes the vector definition an appealing possibility for research using TL-MCTAG for natural language applications. Although all uses of TL-MCTAG in the computational linguistics literature assume the set definition of TL-MCTAG, the linguistic analyses therein do not require the additional flexibility provided by the set definition (Kallmeyer and Joshi 2003; Nesson and Shieber 2006, 2007; Kallmeyer and Romero 2007; Nesson 2009). This is not a coincidence. Multicomponent tree sets are generally used to model syntactic and semantic constructs in which one tree in the set strictly dominates another and has a different syntactic or semantic type: for instance, a quantifier and its bound variable. The locations at which the trees in these sets adjoin are not interchangeable both because of the dominance constraint and because of the difference in type (and, correspondingly, root node label). As a result, these grammars may be converted to the vector definition without any change in the elementary trees, the generated language, or grammar size but with crucial gains in the worst case bounds on processing efficiency. 5. Parsing
Although no algorithms for parsing TL-MCTAG have previously been published, the standard method for parsing LCFRS-equivalent formalisms can be applied directly to
TL-MCTAG to produce an algorithm with complexity O ( | G | p | offer a novel parser for TL-MCTAG for which q is constant. With our algorithm, for the set definition of TL-MCTAG p depends on both the rank and fan-out of the input grammar. For the vector definition of TL-MCTAG p depends on the rank of the input grammar but contains no index of the fan-out.

MCTAG parsing algorithm. 5.1 CKY-Style TAG Parsing
Following the method of Seki et al. (1991), a naive parser for TAG may be constructed by generating a single inference rule for each tree in the grammar. For a tree containing r links, the rule will have r antecedents with each antecedent item representing a tree that can adjoin at one of the links. Each adjoining tree will cover a span of the input string that can be represented by four indices, indicating the left and right edges of the span and of the subspan that will ultimately be dominated by its foot node. Because the location of the links within the consequent tree is known, the indices in the antecedent items are not entirely independent. An example is given in Figure 7. Observation shows that there will be a worst case of 2( r + 1) independent indices in a given rule. Because each adjoining tree is independent, there may be r + 1 different trees represented in a single rule. This results in a time complexity of O ( n 2( r + 1) | input grammar. 460 of the parser. Rather the tree identifiers may be replaced by the labels of the root nodes of those trees, effectively bundling items of trees that share a root node label and cover the same span. This modification to the algorithm reduces the time complexity of the parser to O ( n 2( r + 1) | G | ).
 tion about specific elementary structures from the items of the parser as the GHR opti-mization. When applied, it reduces the time complexity in the grammar size but does not alter the basic form of the time complexity expression. There remains a single term consisting of the product of a polynomial in the input string length and a polynomial in the grammar size. We will return to this observation when examining the complexity of TL-MCTAG parsing.

Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm, first introduced for use with CFGs in Chomsky normal form (Kasami 1965; Younger 1967), to the TAG parsing problem to generate parsers with a time complexity of O ( n 6 | G | 2 ). The speed-up in the parser comes from traversing elementary trees bottom-up, handling only one link at a time. As a result, no inference rule needs to maintain information about more than one link at a time. If the
GHR optimization is applied, the time complexity is reduced to O ( n algorithm of Shieber, Schabes, and Pereira (1995) with minor modifications, using the deductive inference rule notation from that paper. As shown in Figure 8, items in CKY-style TAG parsing consist of a node in an elementary tree and the indices that mark the edges of the span dominated by that node. Nodes, notated  X  @ a , are specified by three pieces of information: the identifier  X  of the elementary tree the node is in, the
Gorn address a of the node in that tree, 9 and the link available at that node if there is one. When no link is present, it is indicated by an underscore, . The node notation  X  @ a maybereadas X  X ode  X  at address a with link  X .
 the node as well as any gap in the node that may be the result of a foot node dominated by the node. The indices are constrained to be non-decreasing from left to right in an item. Nodes that do not dominate a foot node will have no gap in them, which we indicate by the use of underscores in place of the indices for the gap. To limit the number of inference rules needed, we define the following function i the consequent. These indices specify the gap in one antecedent item and the edges of the span in the other antecedent item, indicating that one antecedent item will fill the gap in the span of the other antecedent item. The Foot Axiom similarly makes use of unbound indices p and q . In this rule the entire span of the item is the gap that must be filled when the item adjoins to another item. As noted in Shieber, Schabes, and Pereira (1995), the parser can be made more efficient by only introducing foot items of this sort once an appropriate tree to adjoin into has been parsed for the span from p to q . mar can derive a subtree rooted at  X  @ a with no foot node that spans w of the form  X  @ a , i , j , k , l maintain the invariant that the input grammar can derive a subtree rooted at  X  @ a with a foot node such that the fringe of the tree is the string w node  X  @ a if there is one and null (represented as in the inference rules) otherwise. Adj (  X  @ a ,  X  )holdsif is a link at which tree  X  may adjoin into tree  X  at address a .
Subst (  X  @ a ,  X  )holdsif is a link at which tree  X  may substitute into tree  X  at address a .If is null or the adjunction or substitution is prevented by other constraints such as mismatched node labels, these conditions fail. 462 node. This effectively rules out multiple adjunction. Bounded multiple adjunction may be permitted without affecting the complexity of the parsing algorithm by allowing a a single node could result in an exponential increase in the number of derivations, this is not the case. The link diacritics themselves carry no information about the trees which may adjoin at the associated adjunction site. Any restrictions, such as the requirement of a matching node label, arise from the node itself. As a result, the links are fully interchangeable and serve only as counters of the number of available adjunctions at a node. 10 5.2 CKY-Style Tree-Local MCTAG Parsing As shown in Figure 9, the naive algorithm for parsing TAG may also be applied to
TL-MCTAG. The only difference is that each link may have multiple locations within a given tree. Let r and f represent the rank and fan-out of the input grammar, respectively.
The time complexity of the naive parser will therefore be O ( n the GHR optimization cannot straightforwardly be applied because the maintenance of involved rather than just the labels of the root nodes. Theorem 5 addresses the case in which the input string length is 0. Therefore, in this case, any factor in the complexity including the input string length cannot contribute to the overall time complexity. By showing that the problem is NP-complete when the input string length is 0, Theorem 5 demonstrates that there must be some exponential factor or term in the time complex-ity expression other than the input string length factor. Due to the earlier observation that the GHR optimization does not change the form of the time complexity expression,
Theorem 5 therefore shows that the GHR optimization cannot reduce the exponent of the grammar size term to a constant unless P = NP. This leaves open the possibility of the existence of an algorithm that is polynomial in the grammar size but has an addi-tional exponential term in the time complexity expression. However, such an algorithm, if it exists, cannot be generated by application of the GHR optimization to the baseline parser.

MCTAG case. This is an improvement over the standard LCFRS algorithm because it of a CKY-style tree-local MCTAG parser is given in Figures 10 and 11. For a tree set or vector  X  from G , we notate the trees in the set or vector using indices that are indicated way of differentiating the members of the tree set. Under the vector definition, the index must match the index of the link location where the tree will adjoin.
 adjoin at each multicomponent link. We handle this by adding a link history to each indices and tree set identifiers notated with indices to identify a unique tree within the set. Note that because under the set definition a tree may adjoin at any location of a link, the indices of the link and tree set need not match. The axioms introduce empty link histories, indicating that no adjunctions have yet occurred. When an adjunction adjoins. In order for an adjunction to take place at a multicomponent link, the adjoining tree X  X  tree set must be the same as that of any tree identifier already stored for that
Filter (  X  ,  X  @ a ) function removes links that are completely used from the argument link history. An empty link history indicates that tree locality has been enforced for the subtree specified by the item; thus no additional information need be maintained or passed on to later stages of the parse.
 link history is an associative array of links (not annotated with indices) and tree vector identifiers. An example contrasting the link histories for the set and vector definitions is given in Figure 13.
 464 The maximum link history length is bounded by the rank of the input grammar, r .
Under the set definition, the number of possible values for each element of a link history is on the order of the number of tree sets in the grammar multiplied by the power element of a link history is on the order of the number of tree sets in the grammar. Thus, for the vector definition, the complexity of the algorithm is O ( n variable representing fan-out, f , is present only in the complexity of the set definition.
This demonstrates the novel result that when rank is bounded, even with unbounded fan-out, parsing the vector definition of TL-MCTAG is polynomial.
 one described for the TAG algorithm. Rather than associating each node with at most one link, we permit nodes to be accompanied by a set of links. In contrast to the
TAG case, here we must use a set rather than a list to allow for the expressivity that multiple adjunction can provide. In the TAG case a list is sufficient because the links at a node are fully interchangeable. In the TL-MCTAG case, because the links are defined not just by the node where they appear but by the full set of nodes at which locations of that link appear, the links at a given node are not interchangeable. It must be possible to use them in any order. 11 Because the links can be used in any order, the 466 addition of multiple adjunction adds a factor of 2 r to the time complexity of the parsing algorithm. 6. Link Factorization
The parser presented in the previous section has the advantage of running in polyno-mial time if the elementary structures of the input TL-MCTAG are defined as vectors and if the rank of the grammar is bounded by some constant. Bounding the rank by a constant might be too strong a limitation in natural language parsing applications, however. Thus, in the general case the running time of our algorithm contains a factor that is an exponential function of the rank of the input grammar. To optimize parsing time, then, we seek a method to  X  X actorize X  the elementary trees of the grammar in such a way that the rank is effectively reduced and the set of derived trees is preserved.
Although the precise meaning of factorization should be inferred from the subsequent definitions, informally, by factorize we mean splitting a single elementary tree into sev-eral smaller elementary trees without violating the locality constraints of the grammar formalism. In this section we present a novel and efficient algorithm for factorizing a
TL-MCTAG into a strongly equivalent TL-MCTAG in which rank is minimized across the grammar. Here, strongly equivalent means that the two grammars generate the same set of derived trees. 12 6.1 Preliminaries

This operation may also reduce the number of links in  X  , which is our main goal. The factorization algorithm we present in Section 6.2 is based on the detection and factorization of isolated fragments. of all nodes from fragment  X  ( n ) that are part of some link from  X  .Node n is maximal if  X 
Note that for every node n of  X  such that lnodes ( n ) =  X  maximal node n such that lnodes ( n ) = lnodes ( n ) (see Figure 14). Thus, for the purpose of TL-MCTAG factorization, we can consider only maximal nodes. The first criterion in the definition of maximal node, stating that a maximal node always dominates (possibly reflexively) some node involved in a link, will often be implicitly used in the following.

Assume that { l 1 , l 2 , ... , l r } is the set of all links occurring in  X  . For 1 signature  X  ( n ), defined as a vector of size r and taking values over the subsets of lnodes ( n ). For each j ,1  X  j  X  r , we define
Observe that, in this definition,  X  ( n )[ j ] =  X  means that none or all of the nodes of l found within fragment  X  ( n ). The empty signature, written 0, is the signature with all of its components set to  X  .
 dominates the other. This observation is implicitly used in several places subsequently. may encounter several maximal nodes having the same non-empty signature. In our factorization algorithm, we need to consider pairs of such nodes that are as close as possible. Consider two maximal nodes n 1 and n 2 , n 1 = n 468
The ordered pair ( n 1 , n 2 ) is called a minimal pair if  X  ( n maximal node n 3 inthepathfrom n 2 to n 1 with n 3 = n 1 and n  X  ( n 1 ). Consider now a sequence n 1 , n 2 , ... , n q , q is called a maximal chain if each pair ( n i  X  1 , n i ) is a minimal pair, 2 n from  X  with  X  ( n ) =  X  ( n 1 ) are included in the sequence itself.
 have different signatures, and thus one maximal node cannot belong to more than one maximal chain. We now prove some basic properties of the notions just introduced that will be used later in the development of our factorization algorithm and in the proof of some of its mathematical properties.
 Lemma 1
Let  X  be an elementary tree and let n , n be maximal nodes, with n properly dominating n in (ii). (i)  X  ( n ) = 0 if and only if  X  ( n ) is an isolated fragment; (ii)  X  ( n ) =  X  ( n ) if and only if  X  ( n , n ) is an isolated fragment.
Proof dominated (possibly reflexively) by n or none of these nodes is dominated by n . Because n is maximal, we further conclude that at least some link l is found within  X  ( n ). on by some link l are dominated by n ,andthus  X  ( n ) = 0. (ii). Let  X  ( n ) =  X  ( n ), with n properly dominating n . For each link l possible cases. First consider the case where  X  ( n )[ j ] =  X  ( n )[ j ] = true, the link must be in one of three configurations, all of which satisfy the requirement that the locations of l j must be all inside or all outside of the fragment  X  ( n
Now consider the case where  X  ( n )[ j ] =  X  ( n )[ j ] = inated (possibly reflexively) by n and therefore fall  X  X elow X   X  ( n , n ). The remaining nodes on which l j impinges cannot be dominated (possibly reflexively) by n .Wethus conclude that no nodes impinged on by l j occur within the fragment  X  ( n , n ). our algorithm is optimal, namely, that it achieves the smallest rank under the imposed conditions. Lemma 2
Let ( n 1 , n 2 ) be some minimal pair. Then (i) for any node n 3 in the path from n 2 to n 1 ,  X  ( n (ii) for any minimal pair ( n 3 , n 4 ), neither or both of n
Proof (i). Because  X  ( n 2 ) = 0, there is some link l j for which  X  ( n cause n 3 dominates n 2 , n 3 dominates the nodes in lnodes ( n  X  ( n 3 ) could equal 0 is if n . This is a contradiction. (ii). Assume that n 4 is on the path from n 2 to n 1 . From the definition of minimal pair, there must exist a link l k such that  X  ( n 4 )[ k ] =  X  ( n as in the proof of statement (i) for any link l j such that  X  ( n  X  ( n 2 )[ j ] =  X  ( n 4 )[ j ] =  X  ( n 1 )[ j ]. We thus conclude that  X  ( n cause  X  ( n 4 )[ k ] =  X  ( n 3 )[ k ] =  X  and  X  ( n 2 )[ k ] =  X  ( n from n 2 to n 1 .

Let G be an input TL-MCTAG grammar. In this subsection we provide a method for the construction of a TL-MCTAG that produces a grammar that generates the same derived trees as G and that has minimal rank. We start with the discussion of some preprocessing of the input.
 for all nodes n and all links l j of  X  . This can easily be done with a bottom up visit of  X  , by observing that if an internal node n has children n lnodes ( n , l j ) = k i = 1 lnodes ( n i , l j )  X  X j , where X { n } if it does. Using sets lnodes ( n , l and compute the associated signatures  X  ( n ).

Figure 15. We maintain an associative array with node signatures as entries and node lists as values. We visit all maximal nodes of  X  in a top X  X own fashion, creating a list for each different signature and appending to such a list all nodes having that signature.  X  . We now introduce some conventions for doing this. Although it would be possible to 470 excise fragments without the introduction of additional tree structure, we adopt instead two simple tree transformations that preserve auxiliary tree root and foot label matching and result in some simplification of the notation used by the algorithm, particularly in case the root node of a fragment is the same as the gap node of a second fragment within  X  . A schematic depiction of both transformations is given in Figure 16. impinging links that dominates a fresh node n with a fresh link indicating obligatory substitution of the excised fragment. The excised fragment consists of  X  ( n ) including any links impinging on n , but has a fresh root node immediately dominating n with the same label as n . This is shown in the top row of Figure 16.
 the original tree are not altered, and thus they retain their names. The material between them is replaced with a single new node with a fresh nonterminal symbol and a fresh link. This link indicates the obligatory adjunction of the excised fragment. A new root and gap node are added to  X  ( n , n ) to form the excised fragment. This is shown in the bottom row of Figure 16. We remark that any link impinging on the root node of the excised fragment is by our convention included in the excised fragment, and any link impinging on the gap node is not.
 into the tree from which it was excised. The new nodes that have been generated in the excision may be removed and the original root and gap nodes may be merged back together retaining any impinging links.
 processing is required for c .Chain c represents q  X  1 minimal pairs, corresponding to fragments  X  ( n i  X  1 , n i ), 2  X  i  X  q . We do not excise these q because this would create q  X  1 &gt; 1 new links within  X  . We follow instead a procedure that  X  X inarizes X  c , as explained here.
 Note that each tree  X  c has rank two.
 the link refers to the adjunction of a newly created elementary tree  X  An example of the binarization of a maximal chain with q = 4 is reported in Figure 17.  X  that are entirely contained in fragment  X  ( n ). We process each tree set I grammar and each elementary tree  X  in I  X  as follows.

 those items that have a score of one. If the current item is a maximal node n , we excise the fragment  X  ( n )from  X  , leaving in place a fresh node with a single node link denoting obligatory substitution. If the current item is a maximal chain of the form n link denoting obligatory adjunction of the excised fragment. Finally, if the current item is a maximal chain c = n 1 , ... , n q with q &gt; 2, we excise from  X  the whole fragment section. This results in the addition to the output grammar of fragments  X  ( n 2  X  i  X  q , and of newly created elementary tree  X  chain c that is a proper prefix of c . After the processing of all elementary trees in tree set I  X  is completed, the resulting version of set I  X  is also added to the output grammar. ing of the elementary tree  X  depicted in Figure 19. Tree  X  has four links, called l 1  X  i  X  4. Link l n 22 .Links l 3 and l 4 impinge on a single node each, and the impinging nodes are called n 3 and n 4 , respectively. In Figure 19 we have outlined the maximal nodes n , n ,and n that are relevant to this example. Node n dominates both n and n but none of n and n dominates the other. Note that within  X  there must exist maximal nodes other than n , n , and n . For instance, there must be a maximal node dominating (possibly reflexively) node n 3 but not node n 4 . However, this node dominates a single link, and will not be processed by the algorithm because of the requirement at line 12 in Figure 18. We thus ignore this and other maximal nodes in what follows.
 and
The algorithm in Figure 15 will then mark the chain n , n . When processing the elemen-tary tree  X  , the algorithm in Figure 18 will add to its agenda an item n with a score of links ( n ) = 2, as well as the above chain, with a score of links ( n )
Node n is processed first, and fragment  X  ( n ) is excised from  X  leaving in its place a fresh link l 5 . Later on, the algorithm pops the chain n , n from the agenda, and fragment  X  ( n , n ) is excised from  X  leaving in its place a fresh link l then stops. The resulting factorization consists in fragment  X  ( n ) with links l links l 1 and l 6 .
 along with some other mathematical properties. 474 6.3 Mathematical Properties We discuss in this section some mathematical properties of our factorization algorithm.
Let G be the input TL-MCTAG and let G be the output of the algorithm. We start with the issue of correctness. First, notice that our algorithm stops after a finite number of steps, because the number of possible excisions for G is finite. Assume now that  X  and  X  are two isolated fragments within some elementary tree  X  ,and  X  is itself a fragment within  X  . It is easy to see that excising  X  from  X  results in a new fragment of  X  that is still an isolated fragment. Using this observation together with Lemma 1, we can then conclude that all fragments that are excised by the algorithm are isolated fragments.
This in turn implies that each fragment excision in our algorithm preserves tree locality, and G is still a TL-MCTAG.
 back into that tree, at the point from which it was removed. Thus, G generates the same derived trees as G , modulo our trivial tree transformation for the root and the gap nodes. This proves the correctness of our factorization algorithm.
 least two links. This can be shown inductively as follows. Consider first the smallest fragments that are excised from some elementary tree  X  , that is, those fragments that do not contain any other fragment within themselves. These fragments always have at least two links, because of the requirement stated in line 12 in the algorithm. In the inductive case, let  X  be some fragment of  X  from which a second fragment  X  has been already excised in some iteration of the loop at lines from 11 to 23. Fragment  X  is thus replaced by some link l . Because of the definition of maximal node,  X  must contain at  X  , there will still be some other fresh link replacing  X  . We thus conclude that, when excised,  X  always has at least two links. Because excised fragments always have at least two links and since we never consider elementary trees as candidate fragments (line 6), we can conclude that our algorithm always finds a non-trivial factorization of G .
Consider an elementary tree  X  of G with r links and with a maximum of f nodes per link. In the preprocessing phase of the algorithm, the computation of sets lnodes ( n , l |  X  | X  r such sets. Furthermore, we have | lnodes ( n , l the set lnodes ( n , l j ) for the parent node n of n . Clearly, bound for the computation of quantities  X  ( n )and links ( n ) for all nodes in  X  ,andfor extracting a list of the maximal nodes therein as well. 14
Despite the fact that each signature has r elements, and each element of a signature is a an atomic symbol to name each signature (perfect hashing). In this way, signatures can be compared in constant time.

Figure 15, can be implemented in time O ( |  X  | ). This is done by encoding the associative array L in the algorithm through a one-dimensional array indexed by signature names. Each element of the array points to a linked list of nodes, representing a maximal chain. first consider a single elementary tree  X  . We implement the priority queue a heap data structure. The loops at lines 6 and 9 run in time the standard result for populating a heap; see for instance Cormen et al. (2001). At each iteration of the while loop at lines 11 to 23, we extract some fragment  X  ( n )or  X  ( n 1 , n q ). The processing of each such fragment  X  takes an amount of time where |  X  | is the number of nodes of  X  .Insuchaniteration,  X  needs to be re-edited into a new elementary tree with the number of nodes |  X  | X  X  constant that depends on the specific transformation in Figure 16 that was applied in the excision of the fragment tree. Nonetheless, if a suitable representation is maintained for  X  , making use of nodes and pointers, the re-editing of  X  can be done in constant time. Then a single iteration of the while loop takes time fragment. We can then conclude that all iterations of the while loop take an amount of time O ( |  X  | X  log( |  X  | )). 15 rank and fan-out of G , respectively. Putting everything together, the total running time of the factorization algorithm is O ( | G | X  ( r G  X  f G + log( we always have f G  X |  X  M | , this upper bound can be rewritten as on a node of our elementary trees is bounded by some constant, we have r

 smallest possible rank, under the assumption that G and G are strongly equivalent, that is, that they generate the same derived trees.
 isolated fragment within itself. We start by observing that the factorization of G found by our algorithm is maximal. To see this, consider the excision by our algorithm of a maximal chain n 1 , ... , n q within an elementary tree  X  .Thisitemisaddedtothe priority heap at line 10, with a score of links ( n 1 )  X  links found in fragment  X  ( n 1 , n q ), with the exclusion of the links at the gap node n
The chain is then factorized into fragments  X  ( n i  X  1 , n that some fragment  X  ( n i  X  1 , n i ) contains in turn a maximal chain n an isolated fragment of the form  X  ( n ). In the first case we have links ( n links ( n 1 )  X  links ( n q ) and in the second case we have links ( n ) &lt; links ( n
Thus the smaller chain or fragment is processed earlier than our maximal chain, and by the time our maximal chain is processed, the smaller chain or fragment has already been excised. A similar argument shows that the excision by our algorithm of an isolated fragment of the form  X  ( n ) happens after the excision of any maximal chain or fragment included within  X  ( n )itself. 476 isolated fragments of some elementary tree  X  . We say that  X  and  X  partially overlap if the set of nodes shared by  X  and  X  is not empty and is a proper subset of the nodes of both fragments. It is not difficult to see that if  X  and  X  partially overlap, then at least one among  X  and  X  must have the form  X  ( n 1 , n 2 ).
 factorized at their maximal nodes, as discussed in Section 6.1. Let us assume that f and f are two distinguishable maximal factorizations of G . Because no fragment of one factorization can be a sub-fragment of some fragment of the other factorization, there must be some fragment  X  of f and some fragment  X  of f such that  X  and  X  partially overlap.
 must be in the path from n 3 to n 2 . Because  X  is as small as possible, ( n minimal pair. We have then established a violation of Lemma 2(i). Assume now that  X  this argument applies again, resulting in a violation of Lemma 2(i). If  X  has the form  X  ( n 3 , n 4 ), then ( n 3 , n 4 ) must be a minimal pair. Furthermore, n be on the same path within  X  ,with n 1 , n 2 in alternation with n violation of Lemma 2(ii). The assumption that f and f partially overlap then leads to a contradiction, and we must conclude that the maximal factorization of G is unique. show that any factorization f of G other than the unique maximal factorization f be coarser than f M , meaning that each fragment  X  of f is also a fragment of f  X  can be represented as a combination of the fragments of f adjunction). This means that no factorization of G can have rank smaller than the rank of the maximal factorization f M . We conclude that our algorithm is optimal. strong equivalence with the source TL-MCTAG G . Of course there might be TL-
MCTAGs that are weakly equivalent to G , that is, they generate the same language, and have rank strictly smaller than the rank of G . However, finding such structurally different grammars is a task that seems to require techniques quite different from the factorization techniques we have developed in this section. Furthermore, the task might be computationally unfeasible, considering the fact that the weak equivalence problem for TL-MCTAG is undecidable. (Such a problem is undecidable even for CFGs.) in some suitable way, we might be able to further reduce the rank with respect to the algorithm we have presented in this section. In this case the output grammar would not preserve the derived trees, that is, we lose the strong equivalence, but still retain the derivation trees unaltered. Although this is likely not desirable for applications in which the input grammar consists of linguistically motivated trees, there may be other applications for which the preservation of the internal structure of the trees is less important than the processing efficiency that can be gained by more aggressive factorization. Furthermore, it is well known that the desired derived tree for the source grammar can be easily reconstructed from the derivation tree.
 that is, some nodes have more than two children. Currently, the definition of fragment does not allow splitting apart a subset of the children of a given node from the remaining ones. However, if we allow binarization of the elementary trees of the source grammar, then we might be able to isolate sets of links that could not be factorized in the source grammar itself. It is not difficult to construct an elementary tree  X  with r links such we drop such a requirement then we could binarize  X  in such a way that a factorization can be obtained through the application of the algorithm above, such that any tree in the factorization has no more than two links. However, the general problem of restructuring elementary trees in such a way that an optimal factorization is possible is not trivial and requires further research. We leave this problem for future work.
 tary tree. As presented, the factorization algorithm is designed to handle grammars in which multiple adjunction is permitted. However, if multiple adjunction is disallowed and the grammar contains trees in which multiple links impinge on the same node, the use of one link at a node will disqualify any other impinging links from use. This opens up the possibility of further reducing the rank of the grammar by producing tree sets that do not contain any nodes on which multiple links impinge. This can be accomplished by performing a first-pass grammar transformation in which a copy of each elementary tree set is added to the grammar for each distinct, maximal, non-in a reduction of the rank of the source grammar. The factorization algorithm can then be applied to the new grammar. However, if the elementary trees in the source grammar contain clusters of links that are mutually overlapping, the suggested transformation may blow up the size of the input grammar in a way that is not bounded by any polynomial function. 7. Conclusion
This paper explores the complexity of TL-MCTAG, showing that recognition is NP-complete under a range of interesting restrictions. It then provides a parsing algorithm that performs better than the extrapolation of the standard multiple CFG parsing method to TL-MCTAG. As shown by our proofs, the difficulty in parsing TL-MCTAG stems from the rank of the input grammar. We offer a novel and efficient algorithm for minimizing the rank of the input grammar while preserving its strong generative capac-synchronous formalisms that appear computationally intractable but have desirable characteristics for meeting the expressive needs of natural language. It presents novel complexity results and algorithms for TL-MCTAG, a widely known and used formalism in computational linguistics that may be applied more effectively in natural-language processing using algorithms that process it as efficiently as possible.
