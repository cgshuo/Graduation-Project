 Recently, several latent topic analysis methods such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990), Probabilistic LSI (pLSI) (Hofmann, 1999), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) have been widely used for text analy-sis. However, those methods basically assign top-ics to words, but do not account for the events in a document. Here, we define a unit of informing the content of document at the level of sentence as an ment as a set of Events. We use LDA as a latent topic analysis method, and assign topics to Events in a document. To examine our proposed method X  X  performance on extracting latent topics from a doc-ument, we compare the accuracy of our method to that of the conventional methods through a common document retrieval task. Furthermore, as an appli-cation of our method, we apply it to a query-biased document summarization (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998; Okumura and Mochizuki, 2000; Berger and Mittal, 2000) to verify that the method is useful for various applications. Suzuki et al. (2010) proposed a flexible latent top-ics inference in which topics are assigned to phrases in a document. Matsumoto et al. (2005) showed that the accuracy of document classification will be improved by introducing a feature dealing with the dependency relationships among words.

In case of assigning topics to words, it is likely that two documents, which have the same word fre-quency in themselves, tend to be estimated as they have the same topic probablistic distribution without considering the dependency relation among words. However, there are many cases where the relation-ship among words is regarded as more important rather than the frequency of words as the feature identifying the topics of a document. For example, in case of classifying opinions to objects in a doc-ument, we have to identify what sort of opinion is assigned to the target objects, therefore, we have to focus on the relationship among words in a sentence, not only on the frequent words appeared in a docu-ment. For this reason, we propose a method to as-sign topics to Events instead of words.

As for studies on document summarization, there are various methods, such as the method based on word frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova and Van-derwende, 2005), and the method based on a graph (Radev, 2004; Wan and Yang, 2006). Moreover, several methods using a latent topic model have been proposed (Bing et al., 2005; Arora and Ravin-dran, 2008; Bhandari et al., 2008; Henning, 2009; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009). In those stud-ies, the methods estimate a topic distribution on each sentence in the same way as the latent semantic anal-ysis methods normally do that on each document, and generate a summary based on the distribution. We also show that our proposed method is useful for the document summarization based on extracting la-tent topics from sentences. In this study, since we deal with a document as a set of Events, we extract Events from each docu-ment; define some of the extracted Events as the in-dex terms for the whole objective documents; and then make an Event-by-document matrix consisting of the frequency of Events to the documents. A la-tent topic distribution is estimated based on this ma-trix. 3.1 Definition of an Event In this study, we define a pair of words in depen-dent relation which meets the following conditions: (Subject, Predicate) or (Predicate1, Predicate2) , as an Event. A noun and unknown words correspond to Subject, while a verb, adjective and adjective verb correspond to Predicate. To extract these pairs, we analyze the dependency structure of sentences in a document by a Japanese dependency structure (Predicete1, Predicate2) as an Event is because we recognized the necessity of such type of an Event by investigating the extracted pairs of words and com-paring them with the content of the target document in preliminary experiments, and could not extract any Event in case of extracting an Event from the sentences without subject. 3.2 Making an Event-by-Document Matrix In making a word-by-document matrix, high-frequent words appeared in any documents, and ex-tremely infrequent words are usually not included in the matrix. In our method, high-frequent Events like the former case were not observed in preliminary ex-periments. We think the reason for this is because an Event, a pair of words, can be more meaningful than a single word, therefore, an Event is particularly a good feature to express the meaning of a document. Meanwhile, the average number of Events per sen-tence is 4.90, while the average number of words per sentence is 8.93. A lot of infrequent Events were ob-served in the experiments because of the nature of an Event, i.e., a pair of words. This means that the same process of making a word-by-document matrix can-not be applied to making an Event-by-document ma-trix because the nature of an Event as a feature ex-pressing a document is different from that of a word. In concrete, if the events, which once appear in doc-uments, would be removed from the candidates to be a part of a document vector, there might be a case where the constructed document vector does not re-flect the content of the original documents. Consid-ering this, in order to make the constructed docu-ment vector reflect the content of the original doc-uments, we do not remove the Event only itself ex-tracted from a sentence, even though it appears only once in a document. 3.3 Estimating a Topic Distribution After making an Event-by-document matrix, a la-tent topic distribution of each Event is estimated by means of Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Latent Dirich-let Allocation is a generative probabilistic model that allows multiple topics to occur in a document, and gets the topic distribution based on the idea that each topic emerges in a document based on a certain probability. Each topic is expressed as a multinomial distribution of words.

In this study, since a topic is assigned to an Event, each topic is expressed as a multinomial distribution of Events. As a method to estimate a topic distri-bution, while a variational Bayes method (Blei et al., 2003) and its application (Teh et al., 2006) have been proposed, in this study we use Gibbs sampling method (Grififths and Steyvers, 2004). Furthermore, we define a sum of topic distributions of the events in a query as the topic distribution of the query. Through a common document retrieval task, we compare our method with the conventional method and evaluate both of them. In concrete, we regard the documents which have a similar topic distribu-tion to a query X  X  topic distribution as the result of retrieval, and then examine whether or not the esti-mated topic distribution can represent the latent se-mantics of each document based on the accuracy of retrieval results. Henceforth, we call the conven-tional word-based LDA  X  X ordLDA X  and our pro-posed event-based LDA  X  X ventLDA X . 4.1 Measures for Topic Distribution As measures for identifying the similarity of topic distribution, we adopt Kullback-Leibler Di-vergence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), Symmetric Kullback-Leibler Divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (Lin, 2002), and cosine similarity. As for wordLDA, Henning (2009) has reported that Jensen-Shannon Divergence shows the best performance among the above measures in terms of estimating the similarity between two sen-tences. We also compare the performance of the above measures when using eventLDA. 4.2 Experimental Settings As for the documents used in the experiment, we use a set of data including users X  reviews and their eval-uations for hotels and their facilities, provided by uations of a hotel X  X  facilities such as room, location, and so on. Since the data hold the relationships be-tween objects and their evaluations, therefore, it is said that they are appropriate for the performance evaluation of our method because the relationship is usually expressed in a pair of words, i.e., an Event. The query we used in the experiment was  X  X  room is good X . The total number of documents is 2000, con-sisting of 1000 documents randomly selected from the users X  reviews whose evaluation for  X  X  room X  is 1 (bad) and 1000 documents randomly selected from the reviews whose evaluation is 5 (good). The latter 1000 documents are regarded as the objective doc-uments in retrieval. Because of this experiment de-sign, it is clear that the random choice for retrieving  X  X ood X  vs.  X  X ad X  is 50%. As for the evaluation mea-sure, we adopt 11-point interpolated average preci-sion.

In this experiment, a comparison between the both methods, i.e., wordLDA and eventLDA, is con-ducted from the viewpoints of the proper number of topics and the most useful measure to estimate similarity. At first, we use Jensen-Shannon Diver-gence as the measure to estimate the similarity of topic distribution, changing the number of topics k in the following, k = 5 , k = 10 , k = 20 , k = 50 , k = 100 , and k = 200 . Next, the number of topics is fixed based on the result of the first process, and then it is decided which measure is the most useful by applying each measure to estimate the similarity of topic distributions. Here, the iteration count of Gibbs Sampling is 200. The number of trials is 20, and all trials are averaged. The same experiment is conducted for wordLDA to compare both results. 4.3 Result Table 1 shows the retrieval result examined by 11-point interpolated average precision, changing the number of topics k . High accuracy is shown at k = 5 in eventLDA, and k = 50 in wordLDA, respectively. Overall, we see that eventLDA keeps higher accu-racy than wordLDA.
Table 2 shows the retrieval result examined by 11-point interpolated average precision under vari-ous measures. The number of topics k is k = 50 in wordLDA and k = 5 in eventLDA respectively, based on the above result. Under any measures, we see that eventLDA keeps higher accuracy than wordLDA. 4.4 Discussions The result of the experiment shows that eventLDA provides a better performance than wordLDA, there-fore, we see our method can properly treat the latent topics of a document. In addition, as for a prop-erty of eventLDA, we see that it can provide detail classification with a small number of topics. As the reason for this, we think that a topic distribution on a feature is narrowed down to some extent by using an Event as the feature instead of a word, and then as a result, the possibility of generating error topics decreased.

On the other hand, a proper measure for our method is identified as cosine similarity, although cosine similarity is not a measure to estimate prob-abilistic distribution. It is unexpected that the mea-sures proper to estimate probabilistic distribution got the result of lower performance than cosine similar-ity. From this, there are some space where we need to examine the characteristics of topic distribution as a probabilistic distribution. Here, we show multi-document summarization as an application of our proposed method. We make a query-biased summary, and show the effectiveness of our method by comparing the accuracy of a gener-ated summary by our method with that of summaries by the representative summarization methods often used as benchmark methods to compare. 5.1 Extracting Sentences by MMR-MD In extracting important sentences, considering only similarity to a given query, we may generate a redun-dant summary. To avoid this problem, a measure, MMR-MD (Maximal Marginal Relevance Multi-Document), was proposed (Goldstein et al., 2000). This measure is the one which prevents extracting similar sentences by providing penalty score that corresponds to similarity between a newly extracted sentence and the previously extracted sentences. It is defined by Eq. 1 (Okumura and Nanba, 2005).
We aim to choose sentences whose content is sim-ilar to query X  X  content based on a latent topic, while reducing the redundancy of choosing similar sen-tences to the previously chosen sentences. There-fore, we adopt the similarity of topic distributions for Sim tence and a query, and adopt cosine similarity based on Events as a feature unit for Sim the similarity with the sentences previously chosen. As the measures to estimate topic distribution simi-larity, we use the four measures explained in Section 4.1. Here, as for the weighting parameter  X  , we set  X  = 0 . 5 . 5.2 Experimental Settings In the experiment, we use a data set provided at NT-CIR4 (NII Test Collection for IR Systems 4) TSC3
The data consists of 30 topic sets of documents in which each set has about 10 Japanese newspaper articles, and the total number of the sentences in the data is 3587. In order to make evaluation for the re-sult provided by our method easier, we compile a set of questions, provided by the data sets for evaluating the result of summarization, as a query, and then use it as a query for query-biased summarization. As an evaluation method, we adopt precision and coverage used at TSC3 (Hirao et al., 2004), and the number of extracted sentences is the same as used in TSC3. Precision is an evaluation measure which indicates the ratio of the number of correct sentences to that of the sentences generated by the system. Coverage is an evaluation measure which indicates the degree of how the system output is close to the summary generated by a human, taking account of the redun-dancy.

Moreover, to examine the characteristics of the proposed method, we compare both methods in terms of the number of topics and the proper mea-sure to estimate similarity. The number of trials is 20 at each condition. 5 sets of documents selected at random from 30 sets of documents are used in the trials, and all the trials are totally averaged. As a target for comparison with the proposed method, we also conduct an experiment using wordLDA. 5.3 Result As a result, there is no difference among the four measures  X  the same result is obtained by the four measures. Table 3 shows comparison between eventLDA and wordLDA in terms of precision and coverage. The number of topics providing the high-est accuracy is k = 5 for wordLDA, and k = 10 for eventLDA, respectively.
Furthermore, Table 4 shows comparison between the proposed method and representative summa-rization methods which do not deal with latent topics. As representative summarization methods to compare our method, we took up the Lead method (Brandow et al., 1995) which is effective for document sumarization of newspapers, and the important sentence extraction-based summarization method using TF-IDF. 5.4 Discussions Under any condition, eventLDA provides a higher accuracy than wordLDA. We see that the proposed method is useful for estimating a topic on a sentence. As the reason for that the accuracy does not depend on any kinds of similarity measures, we think that an estimated topic distribution is biased to a particu-lar topic, therefore, there was not any influence due to the kinds of similarity measures. Moreover, the proper number of topics of eventLDA is bigger than that of wordLDA. We consider the reason for this is because we used newspaper articles as the objec-tive documents, so it can be thought that the top-ics onto the words in the articles were specific to some extent; in other words, the words often used in a particular field are often used in newspaper ar-ticles, therefore, we think that wordLDA can clas-sify the documents with the small number of top-ics. In comparison with the representative methods, the proposed method takes close accuracy to their accuracy, therefore, we see that the performance of our method is at the same level as those representa-tive methods which directly deal with words in doc-uments. In particular, as for coverage, our method shows high accuracy. We think the reason for this is because a comprehensive summary was made by latent topics. In this paper, we have defined a pair of words with dependency relationship as  X  X vent X  and proposed a latent topic extracting method in which the content of a document is comprehended by assigning latent topics onto Events. We have examined the ability of our proposed method in Section 4, and as its ap-plication, we have shown a document summariza-tion using the proposed method in Section 5. We have shown that eventLDA has higher ability than wordLDA in terms of estimating a topic distribu-tion on even a sentence or a document; furthermore, even in case of assigning a topic on an Event, we see that latent topics can be properly estimated. Since an Event can hold a relationship between a pair of words, it can be said that our proposed method, i.e., eventLDA, can comprehend the content of a docu-ment more deeper and proper than the conventional method, i.e., wordLDA. Therefore, eventLDA can be effectively applied to various document data sets rather than wordLDA can be. We have also shown that another feature other than a word, i.e., an Event is also useful to estimate latent topics in a document. As future works, we will conduct experiments with various types of data and query, and further investi-gate the characteristic of our proposed method.
