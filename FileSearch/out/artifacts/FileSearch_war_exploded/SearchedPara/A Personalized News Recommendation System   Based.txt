 With the advance of World Wide Web, more and more people are accustomed to reading news through news websites, like Google News and Yahoo News. However, faced with the floods of news, people may realiz e that it is difficult to find news ar-ticles they are interested in from the news websites. Personalized recommendation technology is the most effective way to so lve the problem of information overload [1, 2] so far. Among the news recommendation algorithms, content-based algorithms are widely used [1, 2]. Content-based techniques often involve extracting keywords from news articles and modeling user interest model [3, 4]. 
However, in quite a lot of scenario, simply representing the news articles by a bag of words is insufficient [3]. The tags of a news article give readers the most important and relevant information regarding this news article, which is more useful than a bag tag which shows the topic of this news. In most case, whether a reader is interested in a news article depends on the key tag. Therefore, the key tag plays an important role in news recommendation. Assume that a news article is labeled by 3 tags: Russia, fire disaster, forest . If a reader doesn X  X  care about fire disaster , he/she would not read this news article. Therefore, fire disaster is the key tag of this news article for the reader. and  X  X  X   X   X  , which is defined as: 
For a given reader  X   X  , these news articles with the higher  X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X ,  X   X  are rec-ommended to  X   X  . PRST and logins onto PRST for the first time, PRST will record reading behaviors of the user. Assume that the user only clicked news about Google and Facebook . When the user logins onto PRST again, other news articles regarding Google and Facebook are recom-mended according to the cosine similarity between these news articles and the user.
