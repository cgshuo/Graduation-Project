 Entity Linking ( EL ) is the task of linking name mentions in Web text with their referent entities in a knowledge base. Traditional EL methods usually link name mentions in a document by assuming them to be independe nt. However, there is often additional interdependence between different EL decisions, i.e., the entities in the same document should be semantically related to each other. In these cases, Collective Entity Linking , in which the name mentions in the same document are linked jointly by exploiting the interdependence between them, can improve the entity linking accuracy. This paper proposes a graph-ba sed collective EL method, which can model and exploit the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based representation, called Referent Graph , which can model the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Then we propose a collective inference algorithm, which can jointly infer the referent entities of all name mentions by exploiting the interdependence captured in Referent Graph. The key benefit of our method comes from: 1) The global interdependence model of EL decisions; 2) The purely collective nature of the inference algorithm, in which evidence for related EL decisions can be reinforced into high-probability decisions. Experimental results show that our method can achieve significant performance improvement over the traditional EL methods.

 Algorithms, Experimentation. Collective Entity Linking, Collective Entity Disambiguation, Graph-based Entity Linking. Recent years have witnessed a clear move from Web of information to Web of knowledge. For example, Wikipedia provides a Web collaborative plat form for knowledge sharing. The Read the Web project 2 is a research effort for the automatic knowledge base population from Web. The intended goal of such efforts is to create knowledge bases that contain rich knowledge about the world X  X  entities, their semantic properties, and the semantic relations between them . One of the most notorious examples is Wikipedia : its 2010 English version contains more than 3 millions entities and 20 millions semantic relations (Milne et al. [15]). Such resources have often been used in tasks such as text understanding, word sense disa mbiguation, etc. They can also be used in IR to help better understand the texts and queries by bridging entity mentions in them with the entities in the knowledge base. There is a clear advantage to do this: it will be possible for a user to identify and explore the background knowledge of the searched item. For example, in Figure 1, by bridging the mentions in a web text with their referent entities Michael Jordan , Chicago Bulls and Space Jam , we can find and explore the related information about these entities in knowledge base, such as its textual descriptions, their entity types and the semantic relations between them(e.g., Employer-of and Actor-of ). The key issue is to correctly link the name mentions in a document with their referent entities in the knowledge base, example, in Figure 1 an entity linking system should link the http://www.wikipedia.org http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/ SIGIR X 11 , July 24 X 28, 2011, Beijing, China. name mentions  X  Bull s X ,  X  Jordan  X  and  X  Space Jam  X  to their corresponding referent entities Chicago Bulls , Michael Jordan and Space Jam in the knowledge base. The entity linking, however, is not a trivial task due to the name ambiguity problem, i.e., a name may refer to different entities in different contexts. For instance, the name Michael Jordan can refer to more than 20 entities in Wikipedia, some of them are shown below:  X  Michael Jordan(NBA Player)  X  Michael I. Jordan(Berkeley Professor)  X  Michael B. Jordan(American Actor) To deal with this problem, conve ntional entity linking approaches have focused on making independent EL decisions using the local mention-to-entity compatibility ([1][3][4][5][6] [12][17][22][24]). The essential idea was to extract the discriminative features (e.g., the important words) from the description of a specific entity (e.g., the Wikipedia page about the entity), then link each name mention in a document by comparing the contextual similarity with each of its candidate referent entities. For example, the name mention  X  Jordan  X  in Figure 1 will be linked by comparing its contextual similarities with the entities Michael Jordan , Michael I. Jordan and Michael B. Jordan . As these approaches only exploit local features around each name mention, we call these approaches as local compatibility -based approaches . The main drawback of the local compatibility-based approaches stems from the fact that they do not take into consideration the interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, the entities in a topical coherent document usually are semantically related to each other ([11]). For example, in Figure 1, the three entities contained in the document, the NBA player Michael Jordan , the NBA team Chicago Bulls and the Movie Space Jam are all related to each other. In such a case, figuring out the referent entity of one name mention may in turn give us useful information to link the other name mentions in the same document. For example, knowing the mention  X  Bulls  X  refers to the NBA team Chicago Bulls could help us link the mention  X  Jordan  X  to the basketball player Michael Jordan since only this candidate referent entity is semantically related to the Chicago Bulls . Similarly, knowing  X  Jordan  X  refers to the NBA player Michael Jordan could in turn help us figuring out the mention  X  Bulls  X  referring to the NBA team Chicago Bulls . These examples strongly suggest that the entity linking performance could be improved by resolving the entity linking problems in the same document jointly, rather than independently. We refer to this approach as collective entity linking . Given a document, the key problem of collective entity linking is to correctly model and exploit the interdependence between the different EL decisions within it. Recent research work has proposed to model the interdependence in a pair-wise fashion (Medelyan et al. [16]; Milne &amp; Witten [14]; Kulkarni et al. [11]). These methods model the interd ependence between different name mentions as the sum of their pair-wise dependencies, and usually determine the referent entity of a name mention by comparing each of its candidate referents with other name mention X  X  referent entities. For example, in Figure 1, the compatibility between the mention  X  Jordan  X  and the NBA player Michael Jordan is the average relatedness between ( Michael Jordan, Space Jam ) and between ( Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls ). By leveraging the pair-wis e dependency, these methods usually can make more accurate EL decisions than the local compatibility based methods, e.g., it can infer that the  X  Jordan  X  in this example refers to the NBA player Michael Jordan due to its relations with Space Jam and with Chicago Bulls . However, these methods have a number of limitations: First, the pair-wise interdependence model cannot exploit the global interdependence between EL decisions, i.e., the structural properties of this interdependence. For instance, in Figure 1, the pair-wise dependence model cannot take into account the implicit dependency between the mention  X  Bulls  X  and the mention  X  Space Jam  X , since there is no direct relation between their referent entities Chicago Bulls and Space Jam . Second, by modeling the interdependence in the pair-w ise fashion, the number of computation grows exponentially and the inference process is NP-hard, makes the pair-wise model t oo time-consuming to the real-world applications. Recent pair-wise model based methods ([11][14][16]) usually resolved the inference problem using approximate algorithms, which mostly cannot make the purely collective inference. To overcome deficiencies of th e traditional methods, this paper proposes a graph-based collective entity linking method, which can effectively and efficiently model and exploit the global (rather than the pair-wise ) interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based representation, called Referent Graph , which can model the global interdependence between different EL decisions as its graph structure. Then we propose a purely collective inference algorithm, which can jointly infer the referent entities of all name mentions in the same document by exploiting both the global interdependence between different EL decisions and the local mention-to-entity compatibility. We have evaluated our method on a standard EL dataset. The expe rimental results show that our method can achieve significant performance improvement over the traditional EL methods. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) We propose to model the global interdependence between 2) Based on the Referent Graph, we propose a purely collective This paper is organized as follo ws. We first formulate the entity linking problem and briefly review the related work in Section 2. Section 3 describes how to capture the global interdependence between different EL decisions usi ng the Referent Graph. Section 4 describes our method how to e xploit the interdependence for collective entity linking. The experimental results are presented and discussed in Section 5. Fina lly, we conclude this paper and point to some future work in Section 6. In this section, we first formul ate the Entity Linking (EL) problem, then compare and contrast the existing EL methods. E
NTITY L INKING (EL) P ROBLEM : Let M = {m 1 , m 2 denote a collection of name mentions. Each name mention m in M is characterized by its name m.S , its local surrounding context m.C and the document containing it m.D . Given a knowledge base KB containing a set of entities {e 1 , e 2 of EL is to determine the refe rent entities in KB of the name mentions in M. Specifically, we use m.E to denote the referent entity of a mention m.
 As an example, consider the fo llowing EL problem  X  this will be our running example throughout the paper. N

OCUMENT : During his standout career at Bulls, Jordan also acts in the movie Space Jam. K NOWLEDGE B ASE : Wikipedia Here, an EL system should identify the referent entities of the name mentions as m 1 .E = X  Chicago Bulls  X , m Jordan  X  and m 3 .E =  X  Space Jam  X . In recent years, much research work has focused on the EL problem. Depending on how they model and exploit the interdependence between EL deci sions, the existing EL work can be classified into the following three broad categories:  X  Local Compatibility Based Approaches : Initial approaches to EL focused on the use of local compatibility based on some context features. As we stated earlier, the idea is to extract the discriminative features of an entity from its textual description, then link a name mention to the entity which has the highest contextual similarity with it. Mihalcea &amp; Csomai [17] proposed a Bag of Words ( BoW ) based method, the compatibility between a name mention and an entity was the cosine similarity between them. Cucerzan [4], Bunescu &amp; Pasca [3], Fader et al. [6] extended the BoW model by incorporating more entity knowledge such as its categories. Zhang et al. [22] and Mihalcea &amp; Csomai [17] computed the compatibility using classification algorithms. Zheng et al. [23], Dredze et al. [5] and Zhou et al. [24] employed the learning-to-rank techniques, which can take into account the relative rank between the candidate entities. The main drawback of the local compatibility based approaches is that they do not take into account the interdep endence between EL decisions.  X  Simple Relational Approaches : Observed that EL decisions in the same document are interdependent, Medelyan et al. [16] and Milne &amp; Witten [14] have proposed to compute the mention-to-entity compatibility by leveraging the interdependence between EL decisions. The idea was that the referent entity of a name mention should be coherent w ith its unambiguous contextual entities. Medelyan et al. [16] determined the compatibility using the semantic relatedness between the candidate entity and the contextual entities. For example, in Example 1, using the only contextual entity Space Jam , the compatibility between the mention  X  Jordan  X  and the NBA player Michael Jordan is determined by the semantic relatedness between ( Michael Jordan , Space Jam ). Milne and Witten [14] extended the method of Medelyan et al. [16] by adop ting learning-based techniques to balance the semantic relatedness, the commoness and the context quality. The drawbacks of these a pproaches are that they didn X  X  make the collective entity linking, can only exploit the pair-wise interdependence between a name mention and its unambiguous contextual entities, which is usually limited in real world documents. For example, the simple relational approaches will still have difficulty to determine the referent entity Chicago Bulls for  X  Bulls  X  since Chicago Bulls is not semantically related to the Space Jam  X  the only unambiguous entity in the context.  X  Pair-Wise Collective Approaches : One recent approach proposed by Kulkarni et al. [11] can make collective entity linking, but which only model and exploit the pair-wise interdependence between EL decisions. Kulkarni et al. [11] proposed to resolve the collectiv e EL as an optimization problem, where the interdependence between EL decisions is modeled as the sum of their pair-wise dependencies. Two approximation solutions were also proposed to resolve the NP-hard problem of their inference process.
 From the above description, we can see that the interdependence between EL decisions can provide critical evidence for accurate EL decisions. However, all above approaches do not exploit the global interdependence. In the fo llowing sections, we demonstrate how the global interdependence can be modeled and exploited using our graph-based collective EL method. In this section, we propose a graph-based representation, Referent Graph , which can capture both the local mention-to-entity compatibility and the global interdependence structure between different EL decisions. In what fo llows, we first introduce how to model the mention-to-entity compatibility and the interdependence between two EL decisions in the Referent Graph , then define the Referent Graph in detail. The local mention-to-entity comp atibility measures the likelihood of a name mention m referring to a specific entity e , based on its local context m.C . In this paper, the local context of m is the text window around m , and the window size is set to 50 according to the experiments in Pedersen et al. [18]. Traditionally, the compatibility between a name mention m and a specific entity e is determined by the term co-occurrences between the local context of m and the text description of e . Based on the same idea, in our Referent Graph we model the local compatibility as a Compatible relation between name mention and calculated based on the Bag of Words model: where the name mention m is represented as a vector of its Wikipedia page X  X  words. All word s are weighted using the TFIDF schema. As described in Section 1, th e interdependence between two EL decisions in a document means that their referent entities should be semantically related to each other. Based on this observation, the Referent Graph models the dependency between two EL decisions as a Semantic-Related relation between their referent entities. We need a way to measure the strength of the semantic relation between entities, i.e., the semantic relatedness. There has been several research which focused on computing the semantic relatedness between entitie s (Strube and Ponzetto [19]; Milne and Witten [9]). In this paper, we adopt the method proposed by Milne and Witten [9] to compute the semantic relatedness between entities, which computes the semantic relatedness as: where a and b are the two entities of interest, A and B are the sets of all entities that link to a and b in Wikipedia respectively, and W is the entire Wikipedia. We show an example of semantic relatedness between four selected entities in Table 1, where the semantic relatedness can reveal the semantic relations between Michael Jordan and Space Jam , and between Michael Jordan and Chicago Bulls . Now we have two relations: the Compatible relation between name mention and entity and the Semantic-Related relation between entities. In this way, th e interdependence between the EL decisions in a document can be best represented as a graph, which we refer to as Referent Graph . Concretely, the Referent Graph is defined as follows: 
A Referent Graph is a weighted graph G=(V, E) , where the node set V contains all name mentions in a document and all the possible referent entities of these name mentions, with each node representing a name mention or an entity; each edge between a name mention and an entity represents a 
Compatible relation between them; each edge between two entities represents a Semantic-Related relation between them. For illustration, Figure 2 shows the Referent Graph representation of the EL problem in Example 1. By representing both the local mention-to-entity compatibility and the global entity relation as e dges, two types of dependencies are captured in Referent Graph: 1) Local Dependency between name mention and entity. In Referent Graph, the local dependency between a name mention and an entity is encoded as the edge between the nodes corresponding to them, with an edge weight indicates the strength of this dependency. For exampl e, in Figure 2 the dependency between ( Bulls , Chicago Bulls ) is represented as an edge between them. Notice here the dependenc y between name mention and entity is asymmetric : only the entity depends on the name mention, but the name mention does not depend on the entity. 2) Global Interdependence between EL decisions. By connecting candidate referent entities using the Semantic-Related relation, the interdependence between EL decisions is encoded as the graph structure of the Referent Graph. In this way, the referent graph allows us to deduce and use indirect and implicit dependencies, and can take the structural properties of the interdependence into consideration. For example, the name mention Bulls is related to the entity Chicago Bulls , which in turn is related successively to the entity Michael Jordan . An indirect relation between Bulls and Michael Jordan could be established and used in the EL when necessary. Such indirect relations cannot be identified using an approach based on pair-wise dependence modeling. The Referent Graph Construction . Given a document, the construction of Referent Graph takes three steps: name mention identification, candidate entity se lection and node connection. In this paper, we focus on the task of linking entities with Wikipedia, even though the proposed method can be applied to other knowledge bases. Thus we will onl y show how to construct the Referent Graph using Wikipedia: 1) Name Mention Identification . We first identify all name 2) Candidate Entity Selection . In this step, we select the 3) Node Connection. In this step, we add the dependency edge In this section, we propose a pur ely collective inference algorithm, mentions in the same documen t. Given a Referent Graph representation, the goal of the collective EL is to use both the Compatible and the Semantic-Related relations simultaneously in EL decision making. As shown in Section 1, the referent entity of a name mention m should be both:  X  Compatible with the name mention m ;  X  Topically coherent to the other referent entities in the same With respect to the Referent Graph representation, the referent entity of a name mention m should be an entity node which has:  X  A strong Compatible relation with the node corresponding  X  Many strong Semantic-Related relations with the nodes To see how this can work, observe in Figure 2 that if we known the referent entities of  X  Bulls  X  and  X  Space Jam  X  is Chicago Bulls and Space Jam , then the Semantic-Related relation between ( Chicago Bulls , Michael Jordan ) and between ( Space Jam, Michael Jordan ) can provide more evidence for the entity Michael Jordan to be the referent entity of  X  Jordan  X . In contrast, the entity Michael B. Jordan lacks the Semantic-Related relations with Chicago Bulls and Space Jam , which suggests that it is not likely to be the referent entity of  X  Jordan  X , even if it has a stronger Compatible relation with the mention  X  Jordan  X . But it seems that our method faces a  X  X hicken-and-egg X  problem: The referent entity of a name mention depends on the other referent entities in the same document, and in turn the other mention itself. So how we can resolve it? In this paper, we resolve such a problem by making a purely collective inference: 1) Firstly, we collect the initial ev idence for an entity to be the 2) Secondly, the evidence is simultaneously reinforced by 3) Finally, our method makes the EL decisions that have the In the following sections, we describe these steps in detail. Given a document, the initial evidence we used to decide whether an entity is a referent entity of this document is the name mentions in this document and the local compatibilities between these name mentions and their candidate referent entities. Notice that the local compatibility has been encoded as Compatible relation in Referent Graph, th erefore we only use the name mentions in a document M = { m 1 , m 2 , ..., m evidence. The Importance of Evidence . We observed that not all name mentions play equally important roles in the EL process. The referent entities of more important name mentions should provide more information than the referent entities of less important name mentions. For example, cons ider the following document:  X  The Hall of Fame opens its doors to Michael Jordan, the NBA's greatest player X  X ahoo! News  X  The evidence of the name mention Yahoo! News should be less important than the evidence of the name mentions The Hall of Fame , Michael Jordan and NBA . In order to measure the importa nce of the initial evidence, we assign a prior importance score to each name mention. Traditionally, the relative importance of a name mention (notice a name mention is also a phrase) in a document is determined by its TFIDF score. We do the same here: we assign a prior importance score to a name mention m according to its TFIDF score, and which is further normalized by the sum of TFIDF scores of all name mentions in the same document D : Using the above method, we can compute the prior importance of the three name mentions in Figure 2 as Importance( Bulls )=0.30, Importance( Jordan )=0.25 and Importance( Space Jam )=0.45. Given the initial evidence, the s econd step is to reinforce the evidence by propagating them according to the dependency structure captured in Referent Graph. Evidence can be propagated through the two types of edges in Referent Graph in the following way: Compatible Edge : By connecting a name mention and its candidate referent entities, the Compatible edge provides a way to propagate evidence from a name mention (i.e., the initial evidence) to its candidate referent entities. Intuitively, a name mention will only propagate evidence to the entity which has a Compatible link with it (i.e., will only propagate to its candidate referent entities), and will propagate more evidence to the entity which has a stronger Compatible link with it (i.e., has a larger local compatibility CP(m, e) between them). Based on the above assumption, we define the evidence propagation ratio from a name mention m to an entity e as: where N m is the set of the neighbor entities of a name mention m . Notice that there is no evidence propagation from entity to name mention, as Compatible edges only go from a name mention to entities. Using this method, we can compute the evidence propagation ratio in Figure 2 as: P(Space Jam  X  Space Jam ) =1.0, P(Jordan  X  Michael Jordan ) =0.35 and P(Jordan  X  Michael B. Jordan ) =0.52. Semantic-Related Edge: By connecting semantically related entities, the Semantic-Related edge provides a way to propagate evidence between two related EL decisions by propagating evidence between their referent entities. Intuitively, an entity will only propagate evidence to its neighbor entities, and will propagate more evidence to the entity which has stronger Semantic-Related relation with it. Based on the above assumption, we define the evidence propagation ratio from entity e i as: method, we can compute the ev idence propagation ratio between entities in Figure 2, e.g., P (Space Jam  X  Michael Jordan)=1.0 and P (Michael Jordan  X  Space Jam)=0.446. This section describes the collective inference algorithm of our EL method. Specifically, given a name mention m in a document d , we identify its referent entity as: where CP(m,e) is the local compatibility between m and e , r the evidence score for entity e to be a referent entity of the document d . In this way, the EL decision can combine the evidence from the name mention (i.e., the CP(m,e) ) and the evidence from related EL decisions (i.e., the r d (e) ). Since CP(m,e) is known in the Referent Graph, the only problem is to compute r (e) . Here we demonstrate how to jointly compute the r d candidate referent entities of a document d , therefore collectively infer the referent entities of all name mentions in a document d . To simplify the description of our algorithm, given a Referent Graph G=(V, E) contains n nodes (with k name mention nodes and l entity nodes) we assign each node an integer index from 1 to | V | and use this index to represen t the node, then we can write the adjacency matrix of the Referent Graph G as A , where A[i,j] or A is the edge weight between node i and node j . We introduce the follows three notations for our collective EL algorithm: : The initial evidence vector, an n  X  1 vector where s i =Importance( m ) if i corresponds to a name mention m ; : The evidence vector, an n  X  1 vector where r i is the evidence score for the node i to be an referent entity in document d (i.e., r contained in this node i (if node i corresponds to a name mention). 
T : The evidence propagation matrix, an n  X  n matrix where T the evidence propagation ratio from node j to node i . T computed using the method described in Section 4.3. In this way, the initial evidence is encoded in the initial evidence vector s and the interdependence between EL decisions is encoded in the evidence propagation matrix T , the problem is how to get the evidence vector r . To compute the evidence vector r , we first set its initial value r 0 as the initial evidence vector s , i.e., Then we can update the evidence vector by propagating them according to the interdependence between EL decisions, i.e., the evidence propagation matrix T . In this way, we can write the recursive form of the evidence vector as: where the r t is the evidence vector we know at time t . One problem of the above formula is that some nodes in the Referent Graph without evidence outward edges, when the evidence propagates to this node it disappears. For example, in Figure 2 the entity node  X  Michael I. Jordan  X  cannot propagate any evidence to other nodes. To resolve this problem, we introduce a reallocate condition: at each step we reallo cate a fraction of evidence to the initial evidence vector s , then we can get the final recursive form of the evidence vector as: where (0,1)  X   X  is the fraction of the reallocation evidence at each step, which is set to the value 0.1 through a learning process in Section 5. By solving this e quation, we can get the closed-form solution of evidence vector as: jointly infer the r d (e) value for each candidate referent entity in a document d . Observe the above formula, we can see that our collective inference algorithm can combine evidences from the compatibility between name mention and entities ( T ) and the relative importance of name mentions ( s ). Using the above method, we can compute the evidence score for the entities in Figure 2 and the results are shown in Table 2. From Table 2 we can see that:  X  our collective inference algorithm can effectively identify the referent entities of a document: the three referent entities Space Jam , Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan all received a significantly higher evidence score than other candidate entities such as Bull and Michael B. Jordan ;  X  The interdependence between EL decisions is critical for the correct EL decision: although the compatibility between ( Jordan , Michael Jordan ) is lower than the compatibility between ( Jordan , Michael B. Jordan ), the interdependence information can still give the entity Michael Jordan a significantly higher evidence score. The Random Graph Walk Explanation of Our Algorithm . Notice that s is a normalized vector and T is a column normalized matrix, we can view the evidence propagation process as a random walk process in graph (Gbel &amp; Jagers [8]), where s is the starting vector, T is the random transition probability matrix and r is the stationary probability of the nodes in Referent Graph. In this perspective, the collective inference algorithm of our method is the same as the Random Walk with Restart algorithm (Tong et al. [21]) in graph or the Personalized PageRank algorithm (Haveliwala [20]) in IR. From the random graph walk perspective, we can explain r the probability with which people who read the document d would be interested in the entity e . For example, using the r value, we may predict that 10% people who reading this paper will be interested in the research area Entity Linking , and only 0.01% people who will be interested in the NBA player Michael Jordan . Therefore, we can also view the entity linking task as the process of predicting which entities people will be interested by reading a document according to both the name mentions and the semantic relations between entities. The Posterior Importance of Name Mention . For many applications such as the Wikification of Web page (Mihalcea &amp; Csomai [17]), only the important name mentions in a document will be linked. Therefore, we need to assign an importance score to the name mentions in a docum ent. In Section 4.2, we have assigned a prior importance score to name mention according to its TFIDF score. However, sin ce we have known the referent entity of a name mention, we can update its prior importance score to its posterior importance score as follows: In this section, we assess th e performance of our method and compare it with the traditional methods. As most of the earlier work, this paper evaluates the EL method on the task of linking with Wikipedia , even though the proposed method can be easily applied to other knowledge bases. In following, we first explain the experimental settings in Secti on 5.1, then evaluate and discuss the results in Section 5.2. In our experiments, we use the Jan. 30, 2010 English version of Wikipedia 3 as the knowledge base. We prepared the Wikipedia data according to the method described in Hu et al. [25]. In total, the knowledge base we used contains:  X  Over 3,000,000 distinct entities;  X  A name-to-entity dictionary which contains over 10,000,000  X  Over 20,000,000 semantic relati ons between entities, which Traditional methods usually used the Wikipedia articles as the ground truth entity linking results ([3][4][14][17]). However, as observed in Kulkarni et al.[11], Wikipedia articles are unsuitable to the evaluation of high-recall entity linking tasks because it annotates name mentions very sp arsely (only the important name mentions are annotated). The r ecent Knowledge Base Population track in TAC 2009 4 (McNamee &amp; Dang [12]) has provided a standard data set for the evaluation of entity linking task, but this data set focuses on individual EL tasks in different documents, and is unsuitable for our collective EL settings. Due to the above reasons, we adopted the publicly available IITB data set 5 to evaluate the performance of our EL method, which is also the data set used in Kulkarni et al.[11]. The IITB data set contains a set of documents (107 documents in total) collected from the web sites belonging to a handful of domains. For each document, its name mentions X  referent entities in Wikipedia are manually annotated to be as exhaus tive as possible ([11]). In total, 17,200 name mentions are annot ated, 161 name mentions per document on average. In our expe riments, we evaluate the EL performance using only the name me ntions whose referent entities are contained in Wikipedia. This paper adopted the same performance metrics used in the Kulkarni et al.[11], which includes Recall , Precision and F1 . Let M be the golden standard set of the linked name mentions, M be It can be obtained from http:// download.wikipedia.org for free research use http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/kbp/data/ http://www.cse.iitb.ac. in/~soumen/doc/QCQ/ the set of linked name mentions outputed by an EL method, then these metrics are computed as: Notice here that two name menti ons are considered equal if and only if their names m.S , the documents containing them m.D and their referent entities m.E are all equal (Notice there is no guarantee that a method can achieve the Recall of 1.0). In the same way as in Kulkarni et al.[11], Precision and Recall are averaged across documents and overall F1 is computed from average Precision and Recall . Because Precision and Recall are often negatively correlated, they do not always get their peaks at performance metric. We compare our method with four state-of-the-art baselines: Wikify! . This is the same EL method described in Mihalcea &amp; Csomai [17], which is a standard Local Compatibility based method. The Wikify! computes the local compatibility using the contextual overlap between the na me mention and the dictionary de fi nitions of the entity(in their method, its Wikipedia page). Cucerzan . This is the same method described in Cucerzan [4]. This is also a compatibility based method, but the compatibility between a name mention m and a candidate referent entity e is determined by two factors: the standard local compatibility and the relatedness between e and all other name mentions X  candidate referent entities in the same document. M&amp;W . This is the same EL method described in Milne &amp; Witten [14], which is a state-of-the-art simple relational method . Given a name mention, M&amp;W determines its referent entity by (mainly) comparing each of its candidate referent entity using the average relatedness between the entity and the name mention X  X  unambiguous contextual entities. CSAW . This is the same EL system described in Kulkarni et al.[11]. As described in Section 2, the CSAW is a collective EL method based on the pair-wise EL decision interdependence modeling. Except for the CSAW , all other three baselines are designed only to link the important name men tions (i.e., key phrases) in a document. In our experiment, in order to compare the performances in a high recall, we push these systems X  recalls by reducing their importance threshol ds of linked name mentions. We conduct experiments on the IITB data set with several methods: the baselines Wikify! , Cucerzan , M&amp;W and CSAW , our method using only the local compatibility (i.e., the referent entity of a name mention is simply the entity which has the largest compatibility with this name mention) X  X hich we denote as Our Method(LC) and the full model of our method X  Our Method . For all methods, the parameters we re configured through 10-fold cross validation. The overall pe rformance results are shown in Table 3.

However, because precision and recall are strongly related, it is not straightforwar d to compare the disambiguation precision of different EL systems. Observed that in our experiments all EL systems can achieve a recall larger than 20%, we compare the disambiguation pr ecision of different EL methods at the recall of 20%. The results are shown in Table 4. From Table 4, we can make the following observations: 1) The local context typically is not enough to support a high 2) The interdependence between referent entities is the better Usually, the disambiguation precisi on of an EL system is related to the recall of name mentions. To discuss the tradeoff between recall and precision, we show the pr ecisions at different recalls of our method in Figure 3 (Notice that the highest Recall that can be correspondingly 0.83 and 0.32 ). Furthermore, in order to intuitively demonstrate the EL resu lt when pushing the recall into a higher value, Table 5 shows our method X  X  results of the top 20% weighted and the last 20% wei ghted name mentions of the Wikipedia article Michael I.

Figure 4 plots this trade-off. As shown in Figure 4, our method can achieve the best F1 performance when the value of  X  is 0.1. In this paper, we proposed a graph-based method to the entity linking task. This method can collectively infer the referent entities of all name mentions in the same document. By modeling and exploiting the global interdependence between different EL decisions, the proposed method can achieve competitive performance over the traditional methods. In our method, we did not take into account the NIL entity problem of the EL task, i.e., the referent entity of a name mention may not be contained in the gi ven knowledge base. For future work, we will resolve this aspect in our graph-based method by leading a pseudo NIL entity into our model. Furthermore, using the entity linking method, we want to develop a Web entity search and mining system by annotating b illions of Web pages with their entity information.
