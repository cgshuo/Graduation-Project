 1. Introduction
As the accelerated development of information technology, especially the rapid growth of the Web, is changing the circumstances and consequently the structures and processes of scholarly communication, there is renewed interest in the study of scholarly communication to see how it is being transformed, what the similarities or differences between the new formats of communication and the traditional ones might be, and how the new formats facilitate or inhibit the scholarly communication process ( Borgman &amp; Furner, 2002; Cronin, 2001; Zhao, 2003 ).
Citation analysis and other informetric techniques have been applied successfully to the study of this new phenomenon in scholarly communication. As Zhao and Logan (2002) point out, some studies apply, often with modifications, informetric principles and techniques to study the characteristics and link struc-tures of the Web. Examples include studies on search engines that make use of hyperlink structure ( Cle-ver Project, 1999 ), and so-called  X  X  X ebometrics X  X  studies ( Almind &amp; Ingwersen, 1997; Cronin, Snyder,
Rosenbaum, Martinson, &amp; Callahan, 1998; Egghe, 2000; Larson, 1996; Rousseau, 1997; Thelwall &amp; Har-ries, 2004; Turnbull, 2000; Wilkinson, Harries, Thelwall, &amp; Price, 2003 ). Other studies consider  X  X  X lec-tronic ingredients X  X  in journal articles X  X ither in reference lists or in abstracts X  X o gauge the impact of electronic publications on traditional print journal-based scholarly communication ( Harter, 1992; Harter &amp; Kim, 1996; ISI, 2004a; Lu, 1999; McCain, 2000; Youngen, 1997 ). Still others examine scholarly com-munication patterns demonstrated in research papers published on the Web, and study the differences from, and similarities to, what we have come to expect from print journal-based communication ( Goo-drum, McCain, Lawrence, &amp; Giles, 2001; Lawrence, 2001; The Open Citation Project, 2001; Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002; Zhao, 2003, 2004 ).

As part of a larger research project that aims to systematically compare scholarly communication pat-terns between the Web and the print world, the present study focuses on the comparison of author vis-ibility between the Web and print journals as revealed from citation analysis, and discusses the challenges of scholarly communication being increasingly conducted over the Internet to traditional scholarly communication system in general and to the common practice of science evaluation based on the databases of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) in particular. The present study along with other parts of the project ( Zhao, 2004; Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002; Zhao &amp; Strotmann, 2004 ) may con-tribute to the understanding of the transition of scholarly communication from print to electronic media, to advancing citation analysis theory and methodology, and to information organization and retrieval on the Web. 2. Research questions
Within a citation analysis framework, author visibility can either be measured in terms of how frequently authors have been publishing or in terms of how often their published works have been used (cited) by other scholars. Based on this consideration, the research questions to be explored in the present study are as follows.

Are there any significant correlations between author rankings by number of publications identified from the Web and those identified from print journals in the field of XML research? What is the degree of correlation between author rankings by number of citations identified from the Web and those identified from print journals in the XML research field? What has contributed to the differences in author visibility between the Web and the print world?
A study we reported on earlier ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002 ) compared author rankings between the Web and print journals in the XML research field based on a visual inspection of a small set of highly vis-ible authors. We found a considerable difference in publication patterns between these two views, but at the same time similar rankings of the top ten authors as ranked by the number of citations they re-ceived. We also noted the importance of examining the characteristics of author groups with different publication and citation patterns. The present study builds on this earlier study and examines the de-gree of correlation through the use of statistical approaches and more controlled data, and explores possible contributing factors to differences in author visibility by examining specific characteristics of authors. 3. Methodology 3.1. Data collection
The ISI  X  s Science Citation Index ( SCI ) and The NEC Research Institute  X  s CiteSeer study to collect information on research papers published in print journals and on the Web, respectively. To date, the ISI databases including SCI have been used as the single data source for most of the citation analysis studies reported in the literature. SCI was originally designed for print journals, and the majority of journals covered by SCI nowadays are still print-based (in print format or having a print version), although it now also the broadly defined computer science field and publicly available on the Web. Our previous studies have pro-vided evidence that citation analysis studies using CiteSeer as a data source are as valid as those using SCI ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002; Zhao, 2003 ). More information about CiteSeer can be found in Bar-Ilan (2001), Goo-drum et al. (2001), Lawrence, Bollacker, and Giles (1999) and Zhao and Strotmann (2004) .

Although XML technology has applications in a wide range of areas, the core of the XML research field belongs to computer science. Since CiteSeer covered only broadly defined computer science research while
SCI covered all sciences, three sets of source data were collected in order to control for data scope in our comparisons. They were all documents (along with their reference lists) indexed under the term  X  X  X ML X  X  or  X  X  X Xtensible Markup Language X  X  from (1) CiteSeer , (2) the entire SCI database, and (3) journals indexed and classified in SCI as representing computer science research.

Thus, the search terms  X  X  X ML X  X  and  X  X  X xtensible Markup Language X  X  were used to identify papers (citing papers) on XML. The actual searches were conducted on December 18, 2001. Papers that met the searching criteria were retrieved from the databases ( SCI or CiteSeer ) and downloaded into a local machine. Since the abundance of duplicates had previously been identified as one of the major differences between traditional citation databases and those indexing the Web automatically, paper entries retrieved from CiteSeer were examined first by a Java program and then manually to remove possible duplicates. Programs were then developed in Java to convert the data formats of the retrieved paper entries to a data structure that was convenient for subsequent data analyses such as counting citations and co-citations. The data structures used and the algorithms underlying these programs can be found in Zhao (2003) .

To better control for data scope issues, the present study limited the search for citing papers in CiteSeer to  X  X  X eader X  X  fields rather than searching in the full text of the documents as we had done in an earlier study ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002 ). The reason for this change in our data collection method was that SCI only goes as far as abstracts when indexing citing papers, and  X  X  X eader X  X  fields in the CiteSeer database appeared to be similar in scope. We hoped that this way of collecting data would result in more comparable data from the two data sources. 3.2. Data analysis
An author ranking by the number of publications using fractional counts and another ranking by the number of citations using straight counts were produced based on each of the three data sets X  X he data set from CiteSeer , that from the entire SCI database and that from a subset of SCI addressing computer science research, resulting in three author rankings by each of the two ranking criteria. Within each of the two groups of rankings, each author ranking was compared with every other ranking in that group, and for each such comparison, Pearson  X  s r was calculated for the common authors in order to examine the degree of correlation between the two rankings being compared.

Authors  X  characteristics such as age, nationality, research topic, publishing history, nature of affiliation, relationship with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and collaboration preferences, were then exam-ined to identify possible contributing factors to differences in authors  X  visibility. For this purpose, authors were classified as belonging to one of three groups: (1) authors who are highly visible both in SCI and in
CiteSeer , (2) authors who are highly visible in SCI but not in CiteSeer , and (3) authors who are highly vis-ible in CiteSeer but not in SCI .

Among the various methods of counting citations and publications, fractional counts are the most pre-ferred and recommended by many studies ( Egghe &amp; Rousseau, 1990; Lindsey, 1980; Van Hooydonk, 1997 ).
The concept of fractional counts is therefore chosen here for counting authors  X  publications. Specifically, the number of publications of each of the N authors of a publication increases by 1/ N when this publication is counted, where N is normally the actual number of authors of each publication, although the present study took a simplified approach in that it only took into account the first five authors rather than all authors. It was hoped that this approach would approximate strict fractional counts sufficiently as publi-cations with more than five authors were not expected to occur too frequently based on the statistics we had ( Table 1 ), and even if its approximation were insufficient it would still help us to see beyond the straight counts, where only the first author  X  s citation count increases by 1 when a paper is cited.
On the other hand, only straight counts were used here for counting authors  X  citations because they are the only citation counting method supported by SCI . While author rankings by fractional citation counts and by complete citation counts were obtained as well from CiteSeer , results from comparisons between different citation counting methods will be reported in a separate paper. 4. Findings
A search on  X  X  X ML X  X  or  X  X  X Xtensible Markup Language X  X  resulted in 312 papers using CiteSeer (after removing duplicates) and in 374 papers with reference lists using SCI , 268 of which from computer science journals. Among these papers, only 26 were common to both CiteSeer and SCI . The papers from CiteSeer made 4578 citations, and those from SCI made 6782 citations. Among the cited papers from CiteSeer , 22% (987) were proceedings, 22% (991) were Web publications, 2.3% (105) were technical reports, and 2.5% (115) were from books. Among the cited papers from SCI , 20.6% (1399) were proceedings. We were not able to calculate the percentage of other types of documents in SCI due to the limited amount of informa-tion SCI provides about cited papers. It can be seen that papers in both data sources in the present study cite roughly the same percentage of proceedings.

The percentage of citing papers shared by the two data sources was very low (less than 10%), which means that in the XML research field, papers published in journals were not largely made available on the Web and papers published on the Web were not well represented in journals indexed by SCI . Since pa-pers publicly available on the Web have been found to tend to have more impact on research ( Lawrence, 2001 ), there appears to be a need to promote the public availability of research papers on the Web in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of scholarly communication in the XML research field. 4.1. Author visibility indicated by number of publications
An author ranking by fractional counts of publications was produced based on each of the three data sets X  X he data set from CiteSeer , that from the entire SCI database and that from a subset of SCI address-ing computer science research. Parts of these rankings X  X uthors whose fractional publication counts are higher than one X  X re presented in Table 2 . More complete lists can be found in Zhao (2003) .
For practical reasons, we only aimed to select the top-ranked 100 authors in each ranking for closer examination. Although the goal was to select 100 authors, that number was not used as a strict cut-off but as a guideline so that authors with the same number of publications were treated identically: either all or none being selected. As a result, the number of publications used in selecting the top-ranked authors was different from one ranking to another. Specifically, the criterion of  X  X  X ractional publication counts great-er than 0.5 X  X  was used for the ranking from the computer science journals in SCI, resulting in 101 authors, and  X  X  X ractional publication counts greater than 0.8 X  X  and  X  X  X ractional publication counts of at least 0.9 X  X  were used respectively for rankings from the entire SCI database and from CiteSeer , resulting in 104 and 100 authors, respectively. These criteria were those that each resulted in a number of authors that was the closest to the goal of 100 top-ranked authors. 4.1.1. Common authors and correlations between author rankings Among these top authors, 13 authors were common to all three lists, 15 were common to the lists from
CiteSeer and from the entire SCI , 15 were common to the lists from CiteSeer and the computer science journals in SCI , and 77 were common to the lists from the entire SCI and from the computer science jour-nals in SCI . Only about 8% of the authors who actively published were highly visible both on the Web and in print journals. This confirms at a larger scale our observation in an earlier study ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002 ) that two very different groups of scholars were actively publishing on the Web or in journals. The multidisciplinary nature of the SCI database may have led one to expect that results from the Cite-
Seer database, which only covered computer science research, should be closer to those from computer sci-ence journals in SCI than to those from the entire SCI database. Data from the present study reveals that this is not the case.
 The Pearson  X  s r for author rankings of the 113 authors shared by all three full datasets is 0.478 between
CiteSeer and the entire SCI database, 0.258 between CiteSeer and the computer science journals in SCI , and 0.824 between SCI and its computer science journals. Clearly, the author ranking resulting from Cite-
Seer is more similar to that from the entire SCI database than to that from SCI restricted to computer sci-ence journals. We can take that as an indication that CiteSeer is really a database for computer science literature in a quite broadly defined sense, and that the differences we observed in an earlier study ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002 ) between results from CiteSeer and those from the entire SCI database cannot be explained by the multidisciplinary nature of the SCI database as we surmised in that study. We will derive a different explanation for this phenomenon below based on the more controlled data underlying the present study. 4.1.2. Impact of authors who publish in different media
Our earlier study ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002 ) observed that there were more authors in the Web group than in the journal group who have great impact on XML research in terms of the frequency with which they have been cited in the literature. The current data, as discussed below, show that this is true only when very highly visible authors in terms of number of publications are considered. If authors who are not as highly visible are included, more authors in the journal group would be among the highly cited authors.

A list of highly cited authors was obtained by taking authors whose number of citations divided by the total number of citing papers in the corresponding dataset is greater than 0.018 in CiteSeer or in SCI .We call these  X  X  X igh-impact authors X  X  for the convenience of discussion. This list of high-impact authors con-tains 42% of the authors in CiteSeer and 36% of the authors in SCI whose fractional publication counts are greater than one. However, the same list of high-impact authors contains 19% of the authors in CiteSeer and 22% of those in SCI who were among the top 100 or so authors ranked by fractional publication counts.

This indicates that among those scholars who were publishing on the Web, only very highly visible ones are likely to be recognized by the community, and that regular scholars  X  publications in print journals tend to be more widely accepted than those on the Web. This shows that it is still of some concern among XML scholars whether work published in venues other than print journals will be recognized by the community.
If the top authors from both databases (ranked by number of publications) are grouped into three cat-egories: (1) authors who actively publish both on the Web and in journals as indexed by CiteSeer and by
SCI, (2) authors who actively publish in journals but not on the Web, and (3) authors who actively publish on the Web but not in journals, then the same list of high-impact authors contains 47% of the authors in group 1, 19% of those in group 2, and 13% of those in group 3. Clearly, there are considerably more influ-ential authors in the group who publish actively in both media than in those groups who only publish in one of the media. This indicates that the public availability of scholars  X  work on the Web can well contribute to scholars  X  becoming more influential, though it may not be a decisive factor. 4.1.3. Contributing factors The interesting question now is what may have contributed to this pattern of publication.

In order to find an answer to this question, data about authors  X  characteristics, such as age, research top-ics, publishing history, affiliation, and collaboration preferences, were collected and examined. These data are not presented here in a table due to space limitations but they can be found in Zhao (2003) and will be discussed below.

One might expect to see relatively more young scholars on the Web than in journals as it would appear easier for younger scholars to adapt to new technologies than for scholars who have had a long publishing history and who therefore may not be attracted to publishing on the Web as easily. One might also expect to find more scholars on the Web than in journals who have been involved in large group collaboration, as that requires open and effective communication and the Web should be a perfect medium for this. It might also be expected that relatively more scholars from countries outside of North America be seen on the Web as there is a well-documented bias in SCI toward North American journals.
 However, none of these expected patterns emerged from the data we collected in the XML research field.
Neither in fact did we see any clear patterns about how authors  X  age, publishing history, nationality, affil-iation or collaboration preferences contributed to their medium preference. For example, it appears to be true with both the Web group and the journal group that there are almost as many prolific experienced scholars as there are young scholars with short publishing history, and that most of the highly visible schol-ars were professors or students when they published the articles in this study.

The only really clear factor that we were able to discover is that an author  X  s research area was closely related to his or her publishing behavior. Scholars who studied the application of computer science in gen-eral, and of XML in particular, tended to publish mainly in journals. For example, ranked at the very top in
SCI as shown in Table 2 , P. Murray-Rust is a scientist in Computational Biology (Bioinformatics, Molec-ular informatics) and H.S. Rzepa one in Computational Chemistry. They both edited the Chemical Markup
Language (CML) X  X  formal XML language in Chemistry. Gkoutos who is ranked fourth in SCI , was Rze-pa  X  s student and was also involved in CML related research. Similarly, Dolin, who is ranked right after
Gkoutos in SCI , is a researcher in the area of medical informatics who has done research on XML for med-ical information exchange and was involved in the development of related standards. None of these top ranked scholars in SCI in terms of their number of publications appeared at all in CiteSeer .
This is not difficult to understand. Scholars in an application area of a technology (e.g. computational biology) may have adapted to the publishing tradition within that field (here, biology or chemistry) which may be different from that in the core field of the technology they apply (here, computer science). Although
XML researchers in the computer science field are heavily publishing on the Web, scholars in the applica-tion areas of XML may not do so because they act more like, say, biologists than like computer scientists in terms of their publishing behavior.
 4.2. Author visibility indicated by number of citations
An author ranking by straight citation counts was produced based on each of the three data sets X  X he data set from CiteSeer , the one from the entire SCI database and that from a subset of SCI addressing com-puter science research. Part of these rankings X  X uthors whose citation counts, divided by number of citing papers in corresponding datasets, were 0.035 or higher X  X s presented in Table 3 . More complete lists can be found in Zhao (2003) .

Again, as discussed earlier, for reasons of convenience, we only aimed to select the top ranked 100 authors in each ranking for closer examination. Although the goal was to select 100 authors, the number  X  X 100 X  X  was not used strictly as a cut-off but as a guideline so that authors with the same number of citations are treated identically: either all or none being selected. As a result, the number of citations used in selecting the top ranked authors was different from one ranking to another. Specifically, the criterion of  X  X  X ix or more citations X  X  was used for the ranking from the computer science journals in SCI and that from CiteSeer , resulting in 100 and 90 authors respectively, and  X  X  X even or more citations X  X  was used for the ranking from the entire SCI databases resulting in a list of 103 authors. These criteria were those that each resulted in a number of authors that was the closest to the goal of 100 top-ranked authors. 4.2.1. Common authors and correlations between their rankings
Among the top authors thus found, 49 authors were common to all three lists, 55 were common to the lists from CiteSeer and from the entire SCI , 49 were common to the lists from CiteSeer and from the com-puter science journals in SCI , and 84 were common to the lists from the entire SCI and from its computer science journals. Through visual inspection of a small set of highly cited authors, our earlier study ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002 ) observed a high correlation for the top 10 authors between the entire SCI database and Cite-
Seer . The present study examined the correlation statistically on a much larger scale: Pearson  X  s r  X  s were cal-culated both for common authors between the three lists of top ranked roughly 100 authors and for all authors that were common to all three full datasets. The Pearson  X  s r for the 49 top ranked common authors is 0.92 between CiteSeer and SCI , 0.91 between CiteSeer and the computer science journals in SCI and 0.98 between SCI and its computer science journals. The Pearson  X  s r  X  s for all the 576 authors that are common to the three datasets turned out to be very similar to those for the 49 top ranked authors: 0.92 between Cite-
Seer and SCI , 0.91 between CiteSeer and the computer science journals in SCI and 0.99 between SCI and its computer science journals.

This shows that the Pearson  X  s r between the author ranking from the entire SCI database and that from the portion of SCI addressing computer science research is very high. The number of top ranked authors shared by the two rankings is fairly high as well. This indicates that current XML research is still mostly limited to computer science or that studies on the application of XML technology in different fields have been publishing in journals that are considered by SCI as belonging to computer science research, or it may mean that SCI , like CiteSeer , defines computer science journals rather broadly.

The Pearson  X  s r between the author ranking resulting from CiteSeer and that from SCI computer science data was unexpectedly lower than that between CiteSeer and the SCI entire database although both were significant and their difference was very small. This suggests that publishing medium may have played a more important role than discipline in shaping the citing authors  X  perceptions of cited authors  X  visibility in the XML research field.

Since results from the entire SCI database and those from computer science journals were very highly correlated and the results obtained from the CiteSeer database were more closely correlated to those ob-tained from the entire SCI , which has also been shown in the comparison between author rankings by num-ber of publications discussed earlier, the following discussion will no longer include the dataset from the computer science journals in SCI .

The high correlations between the author rankings indicate that, when the same citation counting meth-ods are used, a group of authors will be ranked very similarly no matter which of the two data sources is used, CiteSeer or SCI . This confirms our interpretation of the results we found in our earlier study that citation analysis using CiteSeer as a data source is as valid for evaluating scholars as is citation analysis based on SCI data, the data source still most widely used in the literature and widely validated in evaluation studies for scholars and scholarly contributions. This also suggests that publications on the Web should no longer be ignored either as part of the literature for research or as a data source for the study of scholarly communication because they are similar to those in print journals in terms of the way they refer to earlier publications. If this can be confirmed even more strongly in the future, it is good news for informetric schol-ars who either might not have easy access to SCI data, especially those in some developing countries, or who might investigate research areas or researcher populations that are under-represented in SCI , because they may now be able to conduct citation analysis studies using data and tools freely available on the Web and still be confident of getting valid results.

However, although the correlations between author rankings are high for the common authors, com-mon authors only account for about half of the top 100 or so highly cited authors from each dataset as seen from the numbers above. This challenges the common practice in science evaluation in which the ISI database is used exclusively to obtain citation data on performance, and clearly indicates that the best way to evaluate scholars using a citation analysis approach is to combine multiple data sources, such as SCI and CiteSeer , so that the data sources can complement each other and the evaluation results be-come less biased. 4.2.2. Different citation patterns on the Web and in journals
Clearly there are three groups of authors: (1) authors who are highly cited by both documents in SCI and those in CiteSeer , (2) authors who are highly cited by documents in SCI but not by those in CiteSeer , and (3) authors who are highly cited by documents in CiteSeer but not by those in SCI .

Our earlier study ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002 ) pointed out the importance of examining the characteristics of author groups with different citation patterns. In the present study, some characteristics of the three groups of authors were studies in an attempt to identify factors that contribute to the differences in author visibility between SCI and CiteSeer . Due to space constraints these data are not presented here as a table but dis-cussed below (see Appendix H of Zhao, 2003 , for complete data).

An examination of authors  X  characteristics suggests some interesting aspects of scholarly communication in the XML research field.

The majority of the authors who are highly cited in both of the data sources either belong to one or more of several interrelated research groups or have been involved in World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) working groups for XML related standards or specifications.
 Bray, Clark, Fernandez, Robie, Thompson, Chamberlin, Murata, DeRose, Lassila, Maler, Wadler,
Brickley, Apparao, Berners-Lee, Bosak, and Decker are all members of W3C working groups for XML related standards or specifications. Abiteboul, Florescu, Cluet, Milo, and Christophides belong to the
French Project Verso research group; Buneman, Deutsch, Hosoya, and Sahuguet belong to the database group at the University of Pennsylvania; Goldman, McHugh, Papakonstantinou, Chawathe, Widom, and Ullman belong to the database group at Stanford University (mostly the Lore project); and Ceri and Bonifati belong to a group of Italian researchers. All these groups are interrelated not only intellectu-ally as indicated by co-citation but also socially as indicated by co-authorship.

Foundational and historical materials and general opinion papers are highly cited in journals but not on the Web.
 This can be seen quite clearly from Bosak, Goldfarb and Berners-Lee being highly cited in SCI but not in CiteSeer .

Charles F. Goldfarb is the father of  X  X  X arkup languages X  X  and the main author of the Standard General-ized Markup Language (SGML), on which the Web  X  s HTML and XML are based. Although XML as a subset of SGML is much simpler and specifically designed for the Web, and as a result has gained wide recognition and application in the Web context, SGML is still heavily being used in the publishing industry. Goldfarb  X  s two handbooks about SGML and XML respectively are highly cited in SCI but not in CiteSeer . Handbooks represent more mature and secondary materials and therefore are very useful in the industry.
Scholars at the research front however may only refer to them as historical background as these scholars may have found the original material such as the ISO standard on SGML more convenient to use, and hence, to cite.

Tim Berners-Lee is renowned as the father of the World Wide Web and retains today an influential position as the director of the World Wide Web Consortium, while Bosak organized and led the
XML working group in the development of the seminal XML specification. Both Berners-Lee and Bosak have thus laid the foundation of XML and other Web related technologies and have written influential opinion papers, such as XML, Java, and the Future of the Web ( Bosak, 1997 ), XML and the second-generation Web ( Bosak &amp; Bray, 1999 ), Weaving the Web ( Berners-Lee &amp; Fischetti, 1999 )and The Seman-tic Web ( Berners-Lee, Hendler, &amp; Lassila, 2001 ).

These scholars being highly cited in SCI but less so in CiteSeer suggests that papers on the Web are per-haps more at the research front than those in journals which are still referring to a considerable extent to foundational and historical materials and to opinion papers and may therefore contain more reviews and research at earlier stages.

Authors in application areas of XML, such as Chemical Markup Language (CML) and XML for med-ical information exchange, are not as well represented in CiteSeer as in SCI .

As we can see from the earlier discussion about author visibility as indicated by number of publications, scholars in application areas of XML have not published often on the Web but more in journals. Examples include Murray-Rust and Rzepa who led the CML specification effort and Friedman and Dolin who have been involved in research on XML for medical informatics. The citation patterns of scholars in these areas are very similar to their publication patterns: highly cited in SCI but not in CiteSeer . This reveals two things clearly.

First, scholars in these areas have primarily been cited from within their own areas, suggesting that these areas are relatively independent of the rest of XML research and may be quite narrow.

Second, application areas of XML are clearly not well represented on the Web. That means that citation analysis using data and tools on the Web as a data source is currently limited to certain research fields where Web publishing is well accepted by the communities, and may be biased by leaving out either partly or completely certain specialties in which scholars have different publishing behaviors. This limitation would exist until scholarly publishing on the Web is as widely accepted and practiced as publishing in journals.

Authors in the Semantic Web area and in the Programming/processing of XML data specialty are not as well represented in SCI as in CiteSeer .
 Many of the authors in the Semantic Web area were ranked much higher by number of citations in Cite-
Seer than in SCI . Examples include Lassila (24.5 in RI vs. 35.5 in SCI), Brickley (31 vs. 53), and Fensel (34 vs. 46). Others were highly cited in CiteSeer but rarely or not at all in SCI . For example, Hanus and Hor-rocks received 12 and 7 citations in CiteSeer but only 0 and 2 in SCI respectively. This suggests that re-search in the Semantic Web area is better represented on the Web. Since this area of research was still emerging at the time our data was collected, and was aiming to develop  X  X  X he next generation X  X  of the
Web, we have further evidence that research reported on the Web is perhaps more at the cutting-edge than that reported in journals.

Among the authors who were categorized by an SPSS factor analysis routine into the factor that has been identified as representing the specialty XML and programming , most, including Megginson, Klarlund,
Bourret, Aho, Schmidt, and Carl-Christian Kanne, were only highly cited on the Web. Those who were highly cited both in CiteSeer and in SCI were ranked much higher in CiteSeer than in SCI . Examples include Murata (17 in RI vs. 35.5 in SCI ) and Lee (34 vs. 46). This indicates that research in this area is also better represented on the Web than in journals.
 Therefore, the discussion above about the possible bias caused by data and tools on the Web applies to
SCI as well. In other words, citation analysis using SCI data as the only data source may also be biased by leaving out in part or completely certain specialties in which scholars publish heavily in venues other than the journals indexed by SCI .

Research areas are the major contributing factor to differences in author visibility between different media. Age, nationality, collaboration preferences did not seem to have had much effect.

Research on XML database design and implementation is well represented in both media, but research on XML applications is better represented in journals, and research on the Semantic Web and Program-ming/processing of XML data is more visible on the Web.
 In both media, highly cited authors appear to be mostly from North America and Europe (especially
France, Italy and the United Kingdom). French and Italian researchers have been very active in research on XML database design and implementation, while scholars from the UK, such as Clark, Thompson, Brickley, Murray-Rust and Rzepa, have been actively involved in the development of many of the XML-related standards or specifications.

Although there do appear to be more authors among the  X  X  X rint-only X  X  scholars than among the  X  X  X eb-only X  X  scholars who are relatively older and more experienced or less active in large group collaboration, the difference does not seem to be significant. For example, as discussed earlier, both Suciu and Fan have been involved in large group collaboration but one (Fan) was highly cited only on the Web and the other (Suciu) only in journals. Another example is that young scholars can be highly cited both on the Web (e.g. Fan and
Nestorov) and in journals (e.g. Dolin and Gkoutos), probably depending on the topics of their research. 5. Discussion
The findings presented above can shed some light on issues of both citation analysis and scholarly com-munication in transition. 5.1. Citation analysis Citation analysis has had a long history in the study of scholarly communication, and until recently the
ISI databases have served as virtually the only data source for citation analysis studies. The incompleteness, bias, and limitations of this data source have been well studied in the literature; nevertheless, they remained the basis for most such studies, partly because these databases have been the only ones available for this purpose. Despite these problems, studies based upon ISI databases have provided valuable insight into scholarly communication patterns in many fields.

With the Web becoming a more and more powerful communication medium, full text research papers (including reference lists) are increasingly available on the Web. Search engines and even citation indexes are emerging to help researchers make full use of these resources. It is therefore natural for scholarly com-munication researchers to be tempted to use these papers and indexes as a data source for citation analysis studies as they may avoid many of the problems associated with the ISI databases, such as their  X  X  X irst author only X  X  approach to indexing cited papers with multiple authors. However, we have only seen a small number of studies that have made extensive use of Web data sources. The concerns citation analysts may have about their use may include: (1) Lacking a formal refereeing process, Web-publishing is not as well controlled as journal publishing and therefore might be viewed as being flawed for citation analysis. (2) Citation analysis of data from the ISI databases is considered complete enough to get a valid picture of scholarly communication patterns in a research field as papers indexed in these databases are considered to be  X  X  X he most important X  X  portion of the literature in the field. (3) Data and tools on the Web do not cover as many disciplines and are often not as easy to use as the ISI databases.

Findings from the present citation analysis study of XML research may help address some of these concerns.

First, the author ranking by number of citations that resulted from CiteSeer data is highly correlated with that obtained from SCI . In other words, regarding the impact of a group of scholars on research in the XML field, the collective view of citers on the Web is very similar to that of citers in journals. Eval-uation of scholars based on this view should thus be considered as equally valid, provided the discipline being studied is well published on the Web.

Second, the two groups of XML scholars who actively publish on the Web or in journals, respectively, share very few publications, and are concerned with different issues. While all study XML related standards and specifications or XML database design and implementation, research on XML applications is a focus only in print journals, and research on the Semantic Web and on programming for, and processing of, XML data is better represented on the Web. That means that, in order to gain a complete picture of the scholarly communication pattern in a research field and to obtain a less biased indicator of scholars  X  performance in the field, multiple data sources should ideally be used rather than only the ISI database or only CiteSeer .
Third, although there are many advantages to using data and tools on the Web for citation analysis, it is true that they do not currently cover as many disciplines and are not as easy to use as the ISI database in some sense ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002; Zhao, 2003 ). However, these are precisely some of the aspects in schol-arly communication systems that need to be improved upon and to which citation analysis can contribute.
For example, we can investigate how to design and implement a problem solving environment (PSE) for scholarly communication research that would put together in a user-friendly environment all the computa-tional facilities needed for studying problems in scholarly communication, including easy access to SCI and
CiteSeer and support for seamless integration of new data sources, tools for constructing citation indexes from existing full text contents, programs for various citation and co-citation counting methods, statistical analysis tools, and visualization tools ( Zhao &amp; Strotmann, 2004 ). 5.2. Scholarly communication in transition
The differences in XML research focus in the two media as discussed above along with other findings from the present study may also shed some light on issues of scholarly communication in transition. As mentioned above, XML applications were found to be a focus only in print journals, while research into the Semantic Web and the programming for, and processing of, XML data was seen to be more visible on the Web. From the point of view of XML research, unlike the Semantic Web and the programming for and processing of XML data, XML applications are about relatively mature rather than cutting-edge technologies. This may be evidence of research on the Web being more at a research front than that in jour-nals. This was also suggested by foundational and historical material being more highly cited in journals than on the Web, such as handbooks and opinion papers by Goldfarb, Bosak and Berners-Lee X  X ome of the inventors of the Web and XML related technologies.

These results appear to provide evidence for a  X  X  X wo-tier system X  X  in scholarly communication that is be-lieved by some scholars to be a probable future model of the scholarly communication system ( Poultney, 1996; Van Raan, 2001 ). In this model, the first tier is predicted to be a  X  X  X ree space X  X  which represents the scholarly enterprise in  X  X  X eal time X  X  and is most likely to feature free and timely Web-based publications, while the second tier is thought to be the world of more formal publications that is most likely to continue to be dominated by journals ( Van Raan, 2001, p. 61 ). As suggested by the present study and by other stud-ies ( Chan, 2004; Crow, 2002; Zhao, 2004 ), the first tier would primarily serve as an information distribution medium that improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the informal communication, on which scholars have relied heavily to obtain the information they need for their research, while the second tier would pri-marily serve as an archive and evaluation rather than information distribution device. The faster and wider distribution of information on the Web makes the Web a perfect medium for the initial publication of new research results in the first tier, while the journal has served well as an archive and evaluation device for a long time, which makes it natural to continue its role in the second tier.

As we concluded in our study of the intellectual structure of XML research ( Zhao, 2004 ), if this system evolves, journals that currently do not accept papers published on the Web may have to change their pol-icies, and all journals may eventually implement new procedures to reduce or eliminate the time scholars spend reformatting their research papers for journal acceptance after they have been published on the
Web. This could significantly improve the efficiency of scholarly communication. 6. Conclusion
Scholarly communication is increasingly being conducted over the Internet, certainly in the core research areas of computer science but increasingly also in other sciences. This has brought some challenges as well as opportunities to the traditional scholarly communication systems and to the associated evaluation ap-proaches. The present study has explored these through a citation analysis of author visibility in one par-ticular research field X  X he XML research field. It has revealed different scholarly communication patterns in this field on the Web and in print journals in terms of author visibility, has challenged the common practice of using the ISI  X  s databases exclusively to obtain citation counts as scientific performance indicators, and has found evidence for an emerging  X  X  X wo tier X  X  scholarly communication system.
 As demonstrated in this study, with scholarly communication increasingly being carried out over the
Internet, it has become both important and feasible to use multiple citation data sources in citation analysis studies of scholarly communication, including scholarly publications on the Web, in digital libraries and in institutional repositories in addition to the journal articles indexed by the ISI databases. The inclusion of these new formats of scholarly publications in the evaluation of science not only can contribute to obtaining a more balanced and more complete evaluation, but also may promote a more efficient two-tier scholarly communication system. Scholars may be more willing to publish their works in these new formats if they can rest assured that their work is counted in the evaluation of science, just as scholars now prefer to pub-lish in journals indexed by the ISI databases. We hope that the present study motivates further research in this area to contribute to the transition of the scholarly communication system from one that has evolved with print journals as the center to one that works best for the networked digital environment.
