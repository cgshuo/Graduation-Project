We propose a novel model for landmark discovery that locates region-based landmarks on map in contrast to the traditional point-based landmarks. The proposed method preserves more information and automatically identifies candidate regions on map by crowdsourcing geo-referenced photos. Gaussian kernel convolution is applied to remove noises and generate detected region. We adopt F1 measure to evaluate discovered landmarks and manually check the association between tags and regions. The experiment results show that more than 90% of attractions in the selected city can be correctly located by this method.

It is well observed that photo-sharing on Internet became a common behavior . These users upload photos with associated extra information (e.g. tags, geo-tags) to social websites such as Flickr. Recently many researchers leverage such freely available community-contributed photos to devise novel applications such as photo annotation and travel recommendation. 
Related works such as [1] propose to locate landmarks on map with a point-based model which denotes a landmark as a circle or a point. For example, Fig. 1-b shows the famous landmark  X  X entral Park X  in Manhattan by several points. Such point-based model is limited since sampling by fixed (sometimes noisy) points. 
In this work, we propose a novel region-based model for landmark discovery that locates landmarks with estimated regions on maps as Fig. 1(a). Compared with [1] which uses mean-shift (clustering) method and mines descriptive terms for landmarks from photo tags, our method uses the landmark candidate tags (e.g.  X  X entral park, X  mined automatically) to retrieve geo-referenced photos attached with these tags, and then estimates landmark boundaries. We can further associate the candidate tags with the automatically discovered regions (cf. Fig. 1(a)). 
The basic assumption is that photos taken in the landmark can approximate the landmark region. To prove this assumption, we investigate the association between tags and locations. We found that the majority of photos in the cities are tagged with the names (or synonyms) of landmarks, but surely we also have to trim the wrongly tagged photos. To remove these noises, we use a Gaussian kernel, and set a cutting threshold as a filter. After filtering, we can automatically estimate the landmark region. Our evaluation shows that this method works well on landmark discovery, especially for large-region landmarks. For New York City and Taipei, more than 90% of the attractions can be found within the right place. Because the detected region depends on crowdsourcing tags, it can also give the reference boundaries of non-rigid attractions, such as trails, night markets, and those boundaries are difficult to define with point-based methods. Our dataset is consisted of geo-tagged photos retrieved using Flickr API for the major cities including Manhattan, Taipei, Tokyo, London, Paris, Berlin, and San Francisco. We locate and download the photos, along with their metadata (e.g. tags, geo-tag , timestamp, and photographer), whose geo-locations are within the boundaries of these cities. Each city region can be determined by Geoname website and then treated as city map (cf. Fig. 2). Gaussian Kernel Our system retrieves the photo set whose tags contain the names of candidates which can be either given by users or mined from tags. We illustrate those retrieved photos as points with their corresponding coordinates in the city map as Fig. 2 shows (before convolution); there are one or more dense areas and some noises. Next we apply Gaussian kernel convolution to remove the noises . The kernel is 2-D by Gaussian distribution . are the parameters of kernel. We have conducted the sensitivity

 test for the parameters on some landmark attractions. We find that large kernel size is better for large regions, and vice versa. Region Segmentation The next step is to decide the region threshold to locate the estimated regions, seeded with the retrieved geo-referenced photos. Define , where is the city map pixel value after convolution ; we suggest as , which considers region connectivity for optimizing segmentation . The detected region is the area with pixel values greater than the threshold. For sensitivity test , we use full -search method, and see how region detection score varies with parameters. affects score s limitedly compared with . The best kernel size depends on the shape of region that we want to locate, but it is not practical to assume what the shape is. As we find in the experiments , this method works better on large landmark region s, because it can detect more precise boundar ies with more geo -referenced photos provided within the regions.
For boosting detection performance, we also include region segmentation algorithms such as graph cut and even consider Google map image coherences. However, the further adopted methods do not further improve the performance. Candidate Tag Selection We locate landmark candidate terms from the noisy tags associated with geo-referenced photos by two-step method. The first step is a weak filter in combination of date, frequency, and author number . The second step is the boundary information mentioned as above . Assume that salient landmarks should satisfy two conditions: (a) the number of detected regions should only be few; (b) these detected regions should not be dispersed . Therefore, we reject the false landmark terms by the number of detected regions. We divide the city map into grids . The grids associated with the detected regions should be located within 8-neighbor to satisfy the condition (b). We find about 80% of mined candidates is exact the name of attractions. The other 20% are events, abbreviations, and characteristics of the landmark. 574K photos for Manhattan and 227K photos for Taipei from Flickr. T o evaluate the results, it is necessary to define the ground-truth region, which is from Wikimapia with manually annotated regions by amateurs. We also apply the region images on Google Map to verify the results . Measure terms are defined as: is the detected region; is the ground-truth region, and is intersection operator. Top 10 attractions come from Yahoo! Travel. 
Because we cannot estimate precision and recall for point-based method (c.f. Fig. 1-b) , we do not compare it with our method. Using circles with points as the centers in order to denote regions on maps is not practical as it is difficult to decide the proper radius for those circles. We even find some points of point-based method are not in the correct regions due to unstable clustering. The experiment results are shown in Table 1. The  X  X tatue of Liberty X  is out of our city map. There are some landmarks in Table 1 with low F1. The main reason is the photographing behavior. People usually take photos of landmark  X  X rooklyn Bridge X  when standing on the next bridge called  X  X anhattan Bridge. X  Another case is  X  X hrysler Building , X  a skyscraper. This kind of landma rk can be seen from everywhere in the city . Besides, there is no large plaza existing in front of  X  X t. Patrick X  X  Cathedral , X  so people like to take photos of it across the street. The results for Taipei are shown in Table 2.  X  X amshui Ferry Terminal  X  and  X  X angming Park X  are not in the range of the investigated city map. We found that the ground-truth of  X  X avern X  is wrong. We check the Google Map by human and confirm that the estimated region by our method is correct .  X  X aipei 101 X  is a skyscraper too and thus suffers from a low F1 measure. 
Observed from Table 1 and 2, we know that the association between region and attraction name is 100% in accurac y. Because if the association is wrong, the recall should be 0 (i.e., F1=0). It shows that our system can associate landmarks with correct tags. 
Next, we want to justify the number of attractions that our system can locate, so we crawl attraction lists from Wiki-travel. We obtain 54 attractions for Manhattan, and 46 attractions for Taipei. 94% (51 of 54) from Manhattan can be found in the identified landmarks; 91% (42 of 46) from Taipei. Compared with Wikimapia which is labor-intensive on tagging locations, our system can automatically and dynamically detect quality regions of interesting locations based on the freely available geo-referenced photos, Meanwhile, more than 90% of popular attractions can still be found within the right places by the proposed method. Such boundary information is very helpfu l for related applications such as tag mining, auto annotation, tour guide or recommendation. We also identify certain ways to improve, these emerging methods such as dealing with the photos taken inside buildings, photos of tall buildings, and the locations people cannot approach to take photos..
