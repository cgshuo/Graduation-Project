 The fifth ACM international wo rkshop on cloud data management is held in San Francisco, Ca lifornia, USA on October 28, 2013 and co-located with the ACM 22nd Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The main objective of the workshop is to address the challenges of large scale data management based on the cloud co mputing infrastructure. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from cloud computing, distributed storag e, query processing, parallel algorithms, data mining, and system analysis, all attendees share common research interests in maximizing performance, reducing cost of cloud data management and enlarging the scale of their endeavors. We have constructed an exciting program of four refereed papers and an invited keynote talk that will give participants a full dose of emerging research. A. General Literature Algorithms, Management Cloud computing, data management This workshop is dedicated to a ddress the challenges in managing large collections of data in th e cloud computing environment, and identifying information of value to business, science, government, and society. The huge volumes of data in cloud computing environments pose big infrastruct ure challenges, including data storage at Petabyte scale, massively parallel query execution, facilities for analytical processing, and online query processing. Meanwhile, the emergence of large data centers and cluster computers have created a ne w business model, cloud-based computing, where businesses and individuals can rent storage and computing capacities, rather than make significant capital investments to construct and provision large-scale computer facilities. Cloud-based data storag e and management is a rapidly expanding business. Whilst thes e emerging services have substantially reduced the cost of data storage and delivery, there is significant complexity involved in ensuring that they can sustain consistent and reliable operations under peak loads. A cloud-based environment has tec hnical requirements to manage data center virtualization, lower cost and boost reliability by consolidating systems in the cloud. In addition, cloud systems idea lly should be geographically dispersed, both to reduce their vul nerability to natural disasters and other catastrophes, as well as to bring data and computation closer to a possibly global user base. This trend brings rise to new and complex technical challenges in the areas of distributed data interoperability and mobility. Cloud computing has become a pillar of computer science industry and research, and data management in the cloud computing environment plays a key role. The CloudDB X 2013 workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and progress in the cloud data management area. The theme of the CloudDB X 2013 is to address the challenges of large data management in a cl oud computing environment. This workshop welcomes papers that address fundamental research issues in this challenging area, with an emphasis on personal and social applications of cl oud-based data management. Topics of interest include, but not limited to: This fifth workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in cloud computing and data-intensive system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific applications, and information-based applications to maximize performance, minimize cost and improve the scale of their endeavors. Data management is one of the mo st important research areas in cloud computing. Even though incr easing research interests are focused in this area, people still need a forum to exchange their ideas and results. This workshop ai ms to provide such a forum. This workshop also aims to reflect top research progress in the cloud data management area. The workshop is a one-day workshop. We have invited one keynote, in which Krishna Gade from Twitter will talk about stream processing on big data and cloud platforms; in particular, the storm platform, which is the real time version of Hadoop developed in Twitter, will be presented. We also accept four research papers to be pres ented in the workshop. The presentations will be grouped based on topics. Cloud data management presents many challenges, including problems of scale (storing petaby tes of data, providing massively parallel query execution, facilities for analytical processing, and online query processing), performance issues, service enforcement, security and privacy, and environmental concerns. The CloudDB workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and progress in cloud data management. We have construc ted an exciting program of refereed papers and invited talks that will give participants a full dose of emerging research.
