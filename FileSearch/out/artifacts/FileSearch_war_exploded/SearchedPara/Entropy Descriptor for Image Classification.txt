 This paper presents a novel entropy descriptor in the sense of geo-metric manifolds. With this descriptor, entropy cycles can be easily designed for image classification. Minimizing this entropy leads to an optimal entropy cycle where images are connected in the se-mantic order. During classification, the training step is to find an optimal entropy cycle in each class. In the test step, an unknown image is grouped into a class if the entropy increase as the result of inserting the image into the cycle of this class is relatively least. The proposed approach can generalize well on difficult image clas-sification problems where images with same objects are taken in multiple views. Experimental results show that this entropy de-scriptor performs well in image classification and has potential in the image-based modeling retrieval.

Image classification is the task of classifying images according to their object category, which is significant for both effective im-age organization and retrieval. This problem has been the subject of many recent papers [2, 3] using classifiers based on support vec-tor machine (SVM). Achieving high image classification accuracy, however, is quite challenging. This is partly because semantically related images may reside in an embedded manifold and not a linear hyperplane in the feature space. In this paper, we focus our atten-tion on solving this problem and propose a novel entropy descriptor for image classification.

The proposed entropy is used to describe an embedded manifold with its geometrical features. Image classification is implemented through organizing images as a semantically continuous cycle with entropy minimization. The optimal cycles are actually the extracted model of training images, which could be used to determine the class label of test images. The classification strategy here is to find the best position of a test image in all cycles. The test image is grouped into the class providing the best position, i.e., the class with the least entropy increase resulting from inserting the image to this position. In this study, the optimization problem is solved using tabu search. To expediate the procedure of finding the opti-mal cycle, parallel computing on GPU is adopted to simultaneously calculate the entropy of each element.
The semantic representation of images is the key to the success of image classification. In this study, we propose GEOmetric Man-ifold ENtropy (GEOMEN) to describe the semantic similarity of images in the feature space.

Specifically, given a set of image feature vectors X = { x R m ; i = 1 ; 2 ; :::; n } . We first define an entropy cycle of length n as a closed path without self-intersections. Each vector in this cycle is connected with two neighbors and the corresponding connection order O is symbolized as { o 1 ; o 2 ; : : : ; o n ; o 1 } responds to the index of vectors. Then, the GEOMEN of the set X with the order O is represented as the average of the entropy on every point in the cycle as, and each s ( X; O; i ) is the sum of two components: the spatial po-sition p ( X; O; i ) and geometric g ( X; O; i ) as, Here, is used to adjust the contribution of p to GEOMEN. GE-OMEN essentially represents the smoothness and sharpness of the cycle with the connection order O . In addition, it is also a metric of disorder and similarity of the data in the embedded manifolds. Since image ranking can be thought as the problem of extracting a 1-dimensional manifold, actually a curve, we only consider the representation of GEOMEN on 1-dimensional curves.

The spatial component of GEOMEN is measured by the Eu-clidean distance, p ( X; O; i ) =  X  x o i  X  x o ( i +1)  X  2 x ( i +1) are continuously connected in the cycle order O . The ge-ometric component of GEMOEN is composed of two terms: the curvature of curves and a regularization term . That is, The reason of introducing the regularization term is that the dis-crete curvature is sensitive to noise. The regularization term can significantly improve the robustness of our algorithm.
Since there is a clear distinction between two classes, the en-tropy will greatly increase at boundary points. This enlightens us that misclassifying a point into a class must lead the sharp increase of the entropy of this class with an optimal cycle. In reverse, if a point is correctly grouped into a class, the entropy of this class with an optimal cycle will only change a little, where the principal idea of the proposed classification framework comes from. In our image classification framework, each class is first respectively trained to obtain an optimal cycle (model). Then an unknown image is as-signed a class label through comparing the entropy increase after inserting this image into each optimal cycle.
 In order to find the optimal cycle, we need to minimize the GE-OMEN, O = arg min S ( X; O ) : In this study, we approximate the global minimum of the entropy through a simplified tabu search method. The details about the tabu search method can be found in reference [4]. Since the calculation of entropy of each element is independent, parallel computing is a good way to speed up such an optimization problem. This study makes full use of the ability of graphic processing unit (GPU) in parallel computing and im-plements the tabu search procedure with the CUDA programming technology.

The optimal cycle of each class is actually the extracted model of training images, which could be used to determine the class label of unknown (test) images. The strategy of classification here is to find the best position of a test image Q in all cycles. We means by "best" that the increase of entropy  X  S due to adding this test image to the current position is the least among all positions. The test image is grouped into the class providing the best position. In this case, however, the decision strategy appears too simple to provide correct class information due to the disturbance of acquisition noise and computation error. Therefore, we bring in the idea of k -NN and make it suitable for our framework. Specifically, we pick first k best positions as possible candidates, and then rank all classes according to the following criterion, r ( C i ; Q ) = ( count ( C i where parameter is introduced to prevent over-fitting. count ( C denotes the number of candidates belonging to class C i . avg ( C is the average entropy increase that candidates in class C in and can be formulated as, avg ( C i ) = ( where  X  S represents the entropy increase if image Q is added. The rank r ( C i ; Q ) implies the confidence of image Q belonging to class C i . Obviously, high confidence requires more count and less avg when is fixed. Therefore, image Q is considered as a member of the class with highest rank. The image feature adopted in the following experiments is the Pyramid of Histograms Orientation Gradients (PHOG) [1]. Four datasets are tested: UMIST face 1 , car, gesture, and aircraft. For the convenience of 10 -fold cross-validation, we discarded those classes with the sample number less than 20 in the UMIST face database. The car images were taken with natural background clut-ters. Each gesture class includes 20 images taken from multiple views. The aircraft images were produced through projecting three-dimensional aircraft models into different planes, which is like chang-ing the viewpoint by rotating the models in some sense.
To compare with state-of-the-art methods, the classifier based on SVM was also tested on the datasets stated above. All test re-sults are presented in Table 1, where the second and third columns respectively represents the number of classes and images in each dataset. The last two columns are the average classification ac-curacy respectively obtained using our approach and SVM. The value in parentheses denotes the confidence interval. Although it is well known that SVM has the strong ability of generalization in image classification, the proposed framework obviously has the better performance than SVM, higher accuracy and smaller confi-dence interval. In addition, we employed the NVIDIA GTX 260 GPU to speed up computation. There is distinct improvement of almost 100 times in the computation speed when the size of a class in the aircraft dataset is only 100 . Moreover, the speedup ability is proportional to the size of a dataset, which means that our approach has advantages in handling large-scale datasets.
The good classification performance on the UMIST face and ges-ture datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework is quite promising in the application of face and gesture analysis. In spite of the existence of background clutter in the car images, our method can still work well with the average accuracy 93 : 54% and confi-dence interval 1 : 64 , much better than SVM with the average accu-racy 71 : 04% and confidence interval 5 : 33 . The success in classi-fying the projection images of aircraft models makes possible the future image-based model retrieval. Anyway, no matter how differ-ent the viewpoint of images is or how disordered the image back-ground is, the proposed classification method can always perform well, which demonstrates its feasibility and robustness.
